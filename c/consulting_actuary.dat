50|$|Wendell Milliman (1905-1976) was {{a founder}} of Milliman, Inc., {{formerly}} Milliman & Robertson, {{one of the largest}} actuarial and business consulting firms in the world. Starting as the Pacific Northwest’s only independent <b>consulting</b> <b>actuary</b> in a small two-room Seattle office in 1947, Milliman co-founded, with Stuart Robertson, a company that grew to encompass offices across the nation, first on the West Coast, then in Milwaukee, and then in more than 30 locations throughout the country.

5000|$|His keen {{interest}} {{in the theory of}} probability led him in 1902 to introduce a course in actuarial theory—the first course ever offered in this subject by any University in this country. As a result of his pioneering in this new field, his services were demanded by various states, the United States government, and by Canada in connection with various insurance, pension and banking investigations. He has also served various insurance companies in the capacity of <b>consulting</b> <b>actuary.</b> From 1910 to 1929 he served the U. S.

50|$|However, {{perceived}} drawbacks of {{the scheme}} were {{that it did}} not link to final pay, access was contingent on a medical examination, there was no guarantee for dependents, little provision for risk benefits, and no indexation of benefits. Hence it compared unfavourably to the defined benefit scheme already enjoyed by school teachers under the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act 1918. From 1958 to 1969 several committees were established to review the present arrangements. The recommendations for a DB scheme were initially rejected by Universities in 1960 and again by a committee in 1964, who concluded it was “…unable to make a clear recommendation in favour of either system ”. The Joint Consultative Committee (JCC), established in 1969, commissioned a report from G. Heywood (FSSU <b>Consulting</b> <b>Actuary)</b> that included a proposed outline for USS. It was to be a one eightieth scheme with a three times annuity lump sum, available to new entrants only, no medical examination was required and pensions would not be increased.|$|E
50|$|Natural Risks in Agriculture. He {{served as}} a {{consultant}} in a large project to increase food production in Latin America in the 1980s (in IICA Costa Rica, financed by the US AID). Part of the project involved insurance that enabled farmers to obtain financing for improved agricultural technologies. A key issue was to set up national agriculture insurance companies in most Latin American States, and to obtain reinsurance (at the undeveloped agriculture reinsurance market in those days). Besides its impact on food production, this led later to the development and growth of the world agriculture insurance and reinsurance markets. Through his activities at the PIBF (Palestinian International Business Forum) Kahane initiated {{the adoption of a}} similar approach for the Palestinian Authority, and this project is now in its implementation stages. He had a substantial impact on the setting of rates and terms of the insurance coverage for IFNRA (the Israeli Fund for Insurance of Nature Risks in Agriculture - now named “KANAT”) - for the entire agricultural sector in Israel - as a director for 10 years, and as a <b>consulting</b> <b>actuary</b> since then.|$|E

40|$|Summary: A {{controversial}} {{alternative to}} ERISA/FASB actuarial cost methods and assumptions {{is presented as}} a challenge from the discipline of financial economics. 1. It is argued that economic assumptions prescribed by ERISA and the FASB are financially biased in a fashion that favors equity investments. This is detrimental to shareholders, risky to the PBGC, and of ambiguous benefit to plan participants. A comparison is made between existing methods/assumptions and alternatives that are, in the language of finance, "transparent. " FASB's current "fair value " paradigm follows the transparent financial model. 2. The combination of transparent actuarial cost methods, unbiased actuarial economic assumptions and the Internal Revenue Code Imply that, in the future, U. S. -defined benefit plans will be invested entirely in fixed income. This will reduce the risk exposure of the PBGC, provide tax benefits to shareholders, and provide participants with a more certain measure of their benefit security. MR. KRA: Welcome to Session 37. It is called a panel discussion, but it is really more of a presentation of a student's work. The topic is, “Does an Actuarial Bias Lead to Equity Investments? ” With me this afternoon, we are pleased to have, on my far right Jeremy Gold, who was a <b>consulting</b> <b>actuary</b> for some large employee benefits consulting firms until he decided that he would rather seek the better truth and go to graduate school.
