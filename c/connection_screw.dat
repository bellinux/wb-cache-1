Modular endoprostheses were {{inserted}} into standardized mandibular condyle or body defects in 16 Macaca fascicularis.

Measurements of the contralateral sides of three monkeys that underwent a similar procedure were used as control/baseline BMD.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} of this work was to use finite element analysis to compare the effect of forces coming to bear on abutments 4. 1 or 5. 0 mm in diameter connected to a 5. 0 mm implant (i. e. with or without platform swit - ching). Study design: A 3 D CAD model of a 5 x 11. 5 mm external hex implant was developed, complete with a <b>connection</b> <b>screw</b> and either of two abutments, one 4. 1 and the other 5 mm in diameter, to assess the influence of two loading conditions, i. e. 200 N loaded either axially or off center {{on the top of}} the abutment. Results and conclusions: In the symmetrically loaded models, greater stresses were transmitted to the bone in the area below the neck of the implant in the case of the wider-diameter abutment. When the narrower abutment was considered, the stress lines remained confined to the metal and were transferred to the bone in a more distal position. When the stresses in the bone where compared under non-symmetrical loading of the larger- and smaller-diameter abutments, the stresses reached lower values in the latter case. These findings indicate that platform switching (i. e. coupling a 4. 1 mm abutment with a 5 mm implant) achieves a better, more even distribution of the peri-implant stresses deriving from simulated occlusal loads on the bone margins...|$|E
40|$|The {{titanium}} mandibular modular endoprosthesis fixed with polymethylmethacrylate cement in the medullary {{space of}} the mandible has been introduced in previous studies. However, the internal parts of these devices {{have been found to}} be prone to loosening and wound dehiscence. The current study introduces a newly designed bioactive-coated cementless modular mandibular endoprosthesis, which was used for reconstruction in Macaca fascicularis. The devices were coated with hydroxyapatite (HA) and hydroxyapatite/bioglass (HA/BG) and implanted in unilateral mandibular segmental defects in nine monkeys for 6 months. Biomechanical testing found the reconstructed mandible to have a mean stiffness value of 110. 43 N/mm. Histologically, there were both fibrous capsule and woven bone around the device body, and histomorphology analysis showed 64. 17 % bone contact to device stem surface. The percentage bone volume calculated from micro-computed tomography analysis around the stem surface was found to be superior to that reported in previous studies of cemented mandibular endoprostheses. Intermodular <b>connection</b> <b>screw</b> loosening has also been resolved with the dovetail interconnection. In conclusion, the current bioactive-coated cementless mandibular endoprosthesis is feasible for use in mandibular segmental reconstruction. However, insufficient load-bearing capability and a high rate of intraoral wound dehiscence were found in the majority of the study animals.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Problems with {{loosening}} of the modules for the modular endoprosthesis were {{encountered in}} animal studies for mandibular body replacement. We performed a {{finite element analysis}} {{to look at the}} stress distribution and areas of stress concentration in a human sized mandible. Variations were made to the stem and defect length to look at how the forces changed. The hypothesis was: (1) reconstruction with a modular endoprosthesis did not lead to areas of stress concentration beyond the material strength of cortical bone and titanium alloy; (2) changes in dimensions of the endoprosthesis did not cause a corresponding linear increase to the stresses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The endoprosthesis was modelled to create a male, female part with stems and a <b>connection</b> <b>screw</b> (Case I). The stem length was halved (Case II) and defect length doubled (Case III). Geometric data of a human sized mandible were obtained, a continuity defect created digitally at the right molar area and the models combined. Boundary conditions were set and the model loaded to get a bite force of 300 N at the incisor region. An intact mandible was used as a control. RESULTS: The right side of the reconstructed mandible became less rigid and flexed more. The highest stresses were within the endoprosthesis at two areas of stress concentration: (1) shear stress at the superior surface of the stems close to the junction of the stem and the module body; (2) compressive stresses at the bottom bevel of the dove-tailed connection. The stress distribution for Case I and II did not differ much except for the magnitude which was slightly higher for Case II. There was a tendency for outward bending at the module connection for Case III which potentially might cause loosening of the module connection. Displacements of the mandible were less than 1 mm throughout. CONCLUSION: The endoprosthesis with its present dimensions would be expected to perform adequately at a bite force of 300 N. An increase in defect length caused a tendency for bending at the stem and the module connection. With a decrease in stem length, there were little differences except a slight increase in magnitude...|$|E
40|$|Load-bearing cold-formed steel (CFS) walls {{sheathed}} {{with double}} layers of gypsum plasterboard {{on both sides}} have demonstrated good fire resistance and attracted increasing interest for use in mid-rise CFS structures. As the main <b>connection</b> method, <b>screw</b> <b>connections</b> between CFS and gypsum sheathing {{play an important role}} in both the structural design and fire resistance of this wall system. However, studies on the mechanical behavior of <b>screw</b> <b>connections</b> with double-layer gypsum sheathing are still limited. In this study, 200 monotonic tests of <b>screw</b> <b>connections</b> with single- or double-layer gypsum sheathing at both ambient and elevated temperatures were conducted. The failure of <b>screw</b> <b>connections</b> with double-layer gypsum sheathing in shear was different from that of single-layer gypsum sheathing connections at ambient temperature, and it could be described as the breaking of the loaded sheathing edge combined with significant screw tilting and the loaded sheathing edge flexing fracture. However, the screw tilting and flexing fracture of the loaded sheathing edge gradually disappear at elevated temperatures. In addition, the influence of the loaded edge distance, double-layer sheathing and elevated temperatures is discussed in detail with clear conclusions. A unified design formula for the shear strength of <b>screw</b> <b>connections</b> with gypsum sheathing is proposed for ambient and elevated temperatures with adequate accuracy.

These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperature conditions. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for bolted and <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of cold-formed steel structures at elevated temperatures. A total of 30 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration of the thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures, and also to determine the critical temperatures for connection tests. A total of 510 tests on single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures was performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the predicted values calculated from the North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for coldformed steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the reduced material properties of the thin sheet steels were used due to the deterioration of material at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. Finite element models for single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear <b>screwed</b> <b>connections</b> were developed and verified against the experimental results.
