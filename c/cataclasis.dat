5000|$|Collins' {{work also}} clearly {{points out the}} very {{important}} role of tectonic deformation in furthering the replacement processes. It is the mechanical breaking-up of primary minerals by means of brittle (<b>cataclasis,</b> faulting) and finally ductile deformations (as in folding, shear zones and mylonites) that allows the metasomatic fluids to become fully effective.|$|E
50|$|A {{cataclastic}} rock {{is a type}} of {{metamorphic rock}} that has been wholly or partly formed by the progressive fracturing and comminution of existing rock, a process known as <b>cataclasis,</b> and is mainly found associated with fault zones. Mylonite was originally defined as a cataclastic rock but is now understood to have formed mainly by crystal-plastic processes.|$|E
50|$|Cataclastic flow usually {{occurs at}} diagenetic to low-grade {{metamorphic}} conditions, however this {{depends on the}} mineralogy of the material {{and the extent of}} pore fluid pressure, as high fluid pressure will promote cataclastic flow in any metamorphic environment. Cataclastic flow is generally instable and will terminate by the localization of deformation into slip on fault planes, where fault propagation can allow <b>cataclasis</b> to migrate into nearby areas of the rock volume.|$|E
50|$|A porphyroclast is a clast or mineral {{fragment}} in a metamorphic rock, {{surrounded by}} a groundmass of finer grained crystals. Porphyroclasts are fragments of the original rock before dynamic recrystallisation or <b>cataclasis</b> produced the groundmass. This means they are older than the groundmass. They were stronger pieces of the original rock, that could not as easily deform and were therefore not or hardly affected by recrystallisation. They may have been phenocrysts or porphyroblasts in the original rock.|$|E
50|$|When tectonic strains {{increase}} and the <b>cataclasis</b> becomes more intense interior breakage in the crystals ensues and albite-twinned plagioclase crystals are bent. The K-metasomatism therefore can reach {{deeper into the}} crystals and increase its effects. Nearly complete to complete replacement of plagioclase takes place and leads {{to the formation of}} wartlike myrmekite in places where the replacement was incomplete. The illustration shows tartan-twinned microcline having completely replaced plagioclase. The places with incomplete replacement are taken up by wartlike myrmekite.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the {{microcline}} in shear zones poses another problem. M.D. Higgins favours the possibility of recrystallization based on Ostwald ripening via metasomatic fluids. L.G. Collins supports a metsaomatic subsolidus growth (potassium- and silica-metasomatism) that has been initiated by ongoing tectonic <b>cataclasis.</b> [...] To be fully effective this process {{is dependent on the}} cataclastic breaking-up of the original crystals as realized in a ductile shear zone along {{the eastern edge of the}} Cathedral Peak Granodiorite (Gem Lake Shear Zone).|$|E
50|$|Cataclasite forms by the {{progressive}} fracturing of mineral grains and aggregates, {{a process known}} as <b>cataclasis.</b> The fracturing continues until a distribution of clast sizes is developed that allows the sliding of clasts past each other, without high enough frictional stresses to further fracture the rock significantly. From then on deformation is accommodated by continued sliding and rolling of fragments, a deformation mechanism known as cataclastic flow. In poorly consolidated or unconsolidated sediments, deformation in fault zones also occurs by rolling and sliding of grains but the porosity of the rock accommodates the resulting strains without significant grain fracturing.|$|E
50|$|At {{shallower}} depths, low {{pressures and}} temperatures can't cause the plastic and viscous behavior of solid rock necessary to move along low angle faults. It is considered that such characteristics may be achieved at significantly less extreme {{conditions in the}} clayey rocks or evaporites, which can then act as tectonic lubricants. The process, which significantly reduces the frictional resistance, is the fluid overpressure, which acts against the normal pressure, thereby reducing high lithostatic pressures and allowing fracturation, <b>cataclasis</b> and formation of tectonic breccia or fault gouge that could act as a decollement plane. Evaporites are also often related the decollement and thrust planes. Evaporites are strongly prone to shear deformation and therefore preferred planes of detachment.|$|E
50|$|Petrographic {{analysis}} using thin sections of samples collected proximal to the geomorphic {{rim of the}} Bloody Creek structure provide abundance evidence of shock metamorphism that is indicative of a hypervelocity impact associated with this structure. This evidence includes microbrecciation and <b>cataclasis,</b> kink-banding and rare planar microstructures in feldspar, reduced mineral birefringence, common mosaicism and planar microstructures in quartz, kink-banding in mica, and systematic degradation of biotite to chlorite showing plastic deformation and flow microtextures. The planar microstructures consist of rare planar fractures and possible planar deformation features. Of these features, the planar deformation features, known as shocked quartz, are considered uniquely diagnostic of shock metamorphism that {{was the result of}} an extraterrestrial impact.|$|E
40|$|Porous {{sandstones}} represent classical reservoirs {{for water}} or hydrocarbons. Deformation in such granular material {{is due to}} tectonic events and occurs {{through the process of}} <b>cataclasis,</b> implying the crushing of the grains to a diversity of smaller clasts. <b>Cataclasis</b> is generally accompanied by porosity and permeability decrease. Although it is known that cataclastic deformation localizes to form individual bands and clusters of bands, the parameters controlling the distribution of this deformation were not well understood until recently. We used scanline measurements to show a favoured localization and clustering of the deformation on the case of normal-fault stress regime and potentially in strike-slip fault regime. The reverse regime favours the formation of distributed networks of conjugate deformation bands. At the scale of a cluster, field data reveals that the minimum modal grain size value of the host sandstone(s) controls the band density. Finally, microscopic cathodoluminescence analysis reveals enhanced quartz cementation for high degree of <b>cataclasis.</b> Hence, because band clustering, high degree of <b>cataclasis</b> and band cementation are favoured in normal-fault stress regime, tectonic extension appears to be favourable conditions for the formation of efficient barriers to fluid-flow in porous sandstone reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of fracturing and <b>cataclasis</b> influences the mechanical and permeability properties of fault zones. Fault zones can behave as strong or weak mechanical discontinuities and as conduits or barriers to fluid flow mainly {{depending on the}} nature and amount of cataclastic rocks that developed in their cores. Our structural investigations in fault zones affecting carbonate platform rocks in the Apennines, Italy, allow us to propose an evolutionary model for the progressive development of cataclastic fault core rocks from damage zones, and for the progression of <b>cataclasis</b> in fault cores. Analyses of particle size in the cataclastic rocks show power law distributions with fractal dimensions spanning over a broad range. This suggests {{that the idea of}} a persistent fragmentation mechanism (self-similar <b>cataclasis)</b> for describing the entire {{evolution of}} natural cataclastic fault cores in carbonate rocks is inadequate. Self-similar evolution for the cataclastic process is a concept mainly derived from laboratory experiments and micromechanical modelling. Conversely, we propose that the fragmentation mechanism progressively changes with the intensity of comminution. Slip localisation within narrow shear bands is favoured when a favourable cataclastic fabric with fractal dimensions D ~ 2. 6 - 2. 7 is achieved in the fault zone. Intense comminution in the narrow shear zones produces the preferential formation of small diameter particles resulting in particle size distributions characterised by D-values approaching or exceeding 3. The progression pathway of fracturing in damage zones and the non self-similar evolution of <b>cataclasis</b> in fault rocks have an important impact on the frictional and permeability properties of fault zones...|$|E
40|$|Intraplate {{large and}} {{moderate}} earthquakes have occurred along the Upper Rhine Graben (URG) {{in the past}} but no coseismic surface faulting has been reported so far. We investigate the 25 -km-long linear Riedseltz-Landau normal fault scarp affecting late Pleistocene and Holocene deposits of {{the western edge of the}} northern URG. The fault zone with cataclastic deformation textures is exposed in the Riedseltz quarry where it affects Pliocene and late Pleistocene (Wurm) units. <b>Cataclasis</b> is demonstrated by spalling and transgranular fractures in quartz grains concentrated in deformation bands with reduced grain size. The observed microstructures suggest multiple phases of deformation with <b>cataclasis</b> followed by emplacement of Fe-oxide matrix into deformation bands, and later emplacement of a clay-rick matrix into fractures. Previous studies along the fault show late Pleistocene (Wurm) loess deposits and early Holocene sand-silty deposits with 1. 5 m and 0. 7 m surface slip, respectively. New and previous results provide a minimum 0. 15 mm/yr slip rate. A dislocation model suggests a minimum Mw 6. 6 earthquake as a plausible scenario in the western edge of northern URG.

40|$|The Palaeozoic North-Armorican {{shear zone}} (NASZ) (Brittany, France) is {{described}} as an E-W trending dextral, intracontinental shear zone. In {{the valley of the}} Queffleuth river, we outline a well-exposed zone of protocataclasite to cataclasite as the Queffleuth cataclastic zone (QCZ). Four morphological fault classes are defined in the QCZ based on the petrographic characteristics of the fault planes. The first fault class is clearly related to <b>cataclasis,</b> as the matrix/clast ratio increases and the clast size decreases towards the individual fault planes. The other three morphological classes cross-cut the cataclasite and are therefore considered to postdate <b>cataclasis.</b> A palaeostress analysis allowed to distinguish five distinct stress states, which are dominated by oblique to pure strike-slip N-S trending faults, that are oriented antithetic with respect to the overall trend of the NASZ. Both dextral and sinistral E-W kinematics are inferred for the QCZ. Because all morphological fault classes are identified in each of the stress states, dextral and sinistral kinematics must have occurred during and after <b>cataclasis.</b> Based on the kinematic similarities with the active South Iceland seismic zone, it is suggested that the defined stress states reflect local stress permutations during the early, immature stage of the NASZ. status: publishe...|$|E

The evidence that cataclastic rocks exert a primary control on the frictional strength, stability, seismic velocity and permeability properties of fault zones encourages further research on <b>cataclasis.</b> Here, we report data on particle shape from natural cataclastic rocks in poorly layered carbonates in the Apulian foreland of the Southern Apennines of Italy. Particle shape analyses show that particle angularity decreases with increasing size and, for a given size class, it decreases with increasing fractal dimension of the particle size distribution.

40|$|The {{particle}} size distribution (P. S. D.) of fragmented geological materials {{is affected by the}} fragmentation process, initial size distribution, number of fracturing events, energy input, strain, and confining pressure. A summary of literature shows that the fractal dimension (D) of the P. S. D. is increased by the number of fracturing events, energy input, strain, and confining pressure. Cenozoic <b>cataclasis</b> of granite, granodiorites, gneisses and arkose seen in cores from the Cajon Pass dritlhole, southern California, produced P. S. D. s with values of D that varied from 1. 88 to 3. 08. Each rock type has a characteristic and more limited range of D. Areas of dilatant texture and mode I fracture-fillings have low average values (2. 32 and 2. 37) compared to an average value of 2. 67 in shear fracture-fillings. D has a good inverse correlation with average {{particle size}}. Data from fault rocks in the San Gabriel fault zone, southern California (ANDERSON et al., 1983) have been reanalyzed to show that values of D are higher (2. 10 5. 52) and average particle size is lower than the Cajon Pass samples, but the ranges of values overlap, and the inverse correlation between D and average particle size is extended. Microstructural observations combined with these results suggest that three processes contributed to particle size reduction during <b>cataclasis.</b> The first process of feldspar alteration, which leads to low values of D, has not been previously recognized. The second process is probably constrained comminution (SAMMIS et al., 1987), since the average D in shear fracture-fillings is close to the value of 2. 58 predicted by this theory. A further stage of particle size reduction is demonstrated by an increase of D with <b>cataclasis.</b> This third process is selective fracture of larger particles, which may also operate during localization and the cataclastic flow-to-faulting transition as observed in experiments. A transition from constrained comminution to selective fracture of large particles, and increasing D values with cataclastic evolution and grain size reduction, may be general features of experimental and natural <b>cataclasis...</b>|$|E

In-situ measurements of permeability show a reduction in permeability up to two orders of magnitude in the damage zone (cataclastic bands), while permeability increases along the slip surfaces.

40|$|Abstract: Evaluation of {{hydrocarbon}} entrapment {{and production}} patterns in faulted sandstone r servoirs requires {{understanding of the}} nature and fluid-flow properties of sand-stone-derived fault zones. This study documents the interrelationships between sandstone composition, deformation mechanisms, fault-zone character, and fluid-flow properties (permeability and capillary properties) using a global sandstone dataset. Quartz-rich sandstones deform by <b>cataclasis</b> (most commonly), diffusive mass transfer, or a combination of these processes to form deformation bands. The fluid-flow properties of these zones depend on deformation mechanism(s). Faulting of mineralogically immature sandstones results in the formation of clay-matrix gouge zones by a combination of processes, including <b>cataclasis,</b> intergranular sliding in clay-rich materials, and diffusive mass transfer. Clay-matrix gouge zones generally have lower permeabilities and higher capillary displacement pressures than deformation bands.

Quantification of controls on porosity modification provides post-depositional {{history of a}} sample for modelling the content of intergranular porosity and cement at any back-stripped stage. An innovative back-stripping model was developed to assess {{the relative importance of}} diagenetic and cataclastic processes, and to simulate the development of rock porosity during diagenesis. Cementation is more important than compaction and <b>cataclasis</b> in terms of porosity destruction in most studied cases. Additionally, the relative importance of <b>cataclasis</b> and normal diagenesis can also be quantified using the estimation of poroperm-loss ratios between these processes. Normal diagenesis, excluding structural deformation, is more important than <b>cataclasis</b> in the reduction of porosity and permeability in all selected NRS and ORS samples. Diagenesis and structural deformation modify the volume of interconnected pores defined as effective porosity in the deformed rock. A new approach to the estimation and prediction of effective porosity is proposed using a combination of helium expansion and mercury injection analyses. Quantification of the impact of diagenesis and structural deformation on selected red beds supplements data for modelling porosity development, and for assessing the relative importance between these processes.

One is triaxial shear experiments on quartz gouge at high pressure-temperature hydrothermal conditions (Kanagawa et al., 2000), {{and the other is}} rotary shear experiments on halite gouge at atmospheric pressure and room temperature in the presence of methanol-water mixtures (Bos et al., 2000). In spite of quite different experimental settings and conditions, the results of these two series of experiments are strikingly similar; both <b>cataclasis</b> and pressure solution being active during the experiments, gouge strength rate-controlled by <b>cataclasis,</b> two different frictional behaviors of slip hardening and softening, slip hardening associated with gouge compaction, distributed deformation and wall-rock failure, slip softening associated with localized slip along the gouge-wall-rock interface, and the transition from slip-hardening to slip-softening behavior according to decreasing rate of pressure solution. Although there is a difference in velocity dependence of strength between quartz and halite gouges, these similarities clearly demonstrate the important effects of pressure solution on the frictional behavior of gouge-bearing faults.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} microstructural {{as well as}} {{bulk and}} mineral chemical investigations of deformation bands in uncemented, friable arkosic sands of Miocene age (Vienna Basin, Austria). Our microstructural study indicates grain size reduction by grain flaking in deformation bands with small offsets (0. 5 – 8  cm), and dominant intragranular fracturing and <b>cataclasis</b> of altered feldspar grains at larger displacements (up to 60  cm). Relative to quartz, the sericitized feldspar grains are preferably fractured and abraded, which additionally leads to an enrichment of mainly phyllosilicates by mechanical expulsion from feldspar. Both <b>cataclasis</b> of quartz and feldspar grains and enrichment of phyllosilicates result in grain size reduction within the deformation bands. The measured reduction in porosity of up to 20 % is in some cases associated with a permeability reduction, reflected in the retention of iron-oxide rich fluids along deformation bands.

Here, we investigate porous grainstones of the Globigerina Limestone Formation in Malta, which contain several types of deformation bands in the hangingwall of the Maghlaq Fault: (i) bed-parallel pure compaction bands (PCB); (ii) pressure solution-dominated compactive shear bands (SCSB) and iii) cataclasis-dominated compactive shear bands (CCSB). Geometric and kinematic analyses show that the bands formed sequentially in the hangingwall of the evolving Maghlaq growth fault.

In this study we explored steady-state strength be aviour of a simulated fault rock, consisting of muscovite and halite, using brine as pore fluid. Samples were deformed in a rotary shear apparatus under conditions where <b>cataclasis</b> and solution transfer areknown to dominate the deformation behaviour of the halite. It was found that the steady-state strength of these mixtures is dependent on normal stress and sliding velocity. At low velocities ( 1 fxm s-]), velocity-weakening frictional behaviour occurs along with the development of a structureless cata-clastic microstructure.

An internal, horsebounding thrust of the duplex, {{referred to as the}} Suzume fault, juxtaposes basalt in the hanging wall and sedimentary rocks in the footwall. Structure and fabric of the fault was characterized at the mesoscale to investigate the processes and structural evolution along a plate-boundary d????collement. The fault zone in the hanging wall consists of decimeterthick ultracataclasite bounded by a several m thick zone of fractured basalt, and likely records 2 + km displacement along the thrust. The footwall consists of decimeter-thick ultracataclasite bounded by a 20 -m-thick zone of ductile shear in flattened sedimentary host rock, and likely records 30 + km of displacement. The asymmetric structure across the Suzume fault, as well as inferred displacement fields and timing relations, are consistent with a tectonic model in which the footwall records early ductile, compactive deformation of poorly consolidated sediments during underthrusting at the prism toe region, followed by extremely localized <b>cataclasis</b> at the underplating depth. In contrast, the hanging wall is deformed by intense <b>cataclasis,</b> and only during underplating. Deformation style and strain state in the footwall of the Suzume fault is qualitatively similar to the modern Costa Rica underthrust section at the toe region. Similarity in the structure and fabric of the hanging wall between the Suzume fault and modern d????collement zones sampled through scientific drilling suggests that intense <b>cataclasis</b> under horizontal contraction likely is a common feature for the hanging wall of the d????collement zone throughout the toe to underplating regions. Structures in the Suzume fault that are not in common with the modern d????collements imply progressive consolidation during underthrusting from the toe to underplating depths may be responsible for the localization of shear in the footwall.

While the mechanisms involved in fault sealing are well known, the microscale processes involved and their relative contribution to sealing remain debatable. In particular, {{the extent to which}} diagenetic processes overprint cataclastic fault sealing has not been resolved, mainly due to the long time scales required to measure these effects. Here, we report results from a novel suite of room temperature experiments that combined continuous analysis of dissolved silica using on-line high performance liquid chromatography, with low strain rate creep loading on sandstone cores. This technique allowed changes in silica concentration during different phases of deformation to be resolved, and revealed a 7 -fold increase in overall silica concentration immediately after dynamic faulting by localised <b>cataclasis.</b> Calculations based on these results show that the mass of dissolved silica from the resultant fault gouge increased by up to two orders of magnitude relative to that from the intact rock over the same time scale. This increase represents the first stage of the inherent diagenetic sealing capacity of the fault, presumably through localised diffusive mass transfer. Post-test microstructural studies suggest that the magnitude of diagenetic self-sealing depends on lithological and mechanical attributes of the host rock, which control fault gouge microstructure.
