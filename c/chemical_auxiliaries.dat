30|$|With {{the limit}} of forest {{resources}} all over the world, high-yield pulp (HYP), containing attractive features, such as high bulk, high opacity, high stiffness, good printability et al., has been gaining increasing interests in the manufacturing of uncoated and coated fine paper and paperboards. However, {{the main drawback of}} HYP is the color reversion, since it contains much more lignin [1 – 4]. The special chemical structure of lignin is easily influenced by a certain external environment, for instance, temperature, light, and the presence of metal cations. Among them, the light is the main factor. When the long term exposed under the sunshine, the structure of lignin can easily generate chromophores or auxochromes, losing the brightness of paper to make it yellowing. It leads to the weakness of light stability, especially the brightness stability of HYP, which greatly hindered its application in some high-value paper. According to the research about the light-induced yellowing mechanism of HYP, different proposed yellowing inhibition methods were studied, such as chemical modification of lignin, exploring a new bleaching process of high-yield pulp and adding <b>chemical</b> <b>auxiliaries.</b> From the perspective of cost and effect of light stability, adding <b>chemical</b> <b>auxiliaries</b> (ultraviolet absorbents, radical scavenger, and fluorescent brighteners, et al.) is considered as the most feasible method to exhibit the yellowing of HYP.|$|E

Supposition for {{the transfer of the}} high potentials of the pure material via different processing steps (especially dry pressing) into the sintered end product is the optimization of the processing route in combination with the formulation. Hardmetal mixtures are processed by milling and spray drying of suspensions based on solvents (acetone, ethanol, heptane) or water. Depending on the formulation of the mixture (addition of dispersant, binder, lubricant) the properties of the press bulk can be tailored in a wide range. Besides flowability (bulk density, flow time, size distribution), characterizing properties are internal structure, distribution of granule strength and compaction behaviour of the press bulk.

40|$|Leather {{industry}} is a relatively large source of waste from raw material, so skin waste recovery is a goal of clean technologies. Capitalization of skin waste aims to obtain: <b>chemical</b> <b>auxiliaries,</b> technical articles, hydrolyzed protein, artificial leather, composite building materials, heat sources and collagen biomaterials with applications in medicine, cosmetics, etc. A {{first step in the}} recovery of skin waste is the degreasing operation. Ultrasound is an effective tool to improve the efficiency of the conventional degreasing affecting the chemical substances as well as the treated skin. In addition, the processing time is reduced. Ultrasound is known to enhance the emulsification and dispersion of oils/fat. The usual degreasing methods requires more emulsifier/solvent ratio and process time for emulsification and additional solvent for washing out the emulsified fat. This paper investigates the possibility of recovery through ecological processes of leather waste from finishing operations for further capitalization. The present study aims emulsification and subsequent removal of the fat present in the chamois powder waste from polishing operation with the aid of ultrasound by an aqueous ecofriendly method. The study also took into account the ultrasonic treatment of the leather waste using trichlorethylene as a medium of propagation-degreasing, and realized a comparative analysis of efficiency of fat extraction by Soxhlet method and via ultrasonication.

40|$|Background. Waste paper {{recycling}} {{is characterized by}} deterioration {{in the content of}} fiber mass on the fourdrinier wire of a paper-making (cardboard-making) machine, which leads to the fiber content increase in the pit water and to an increase in losses of the source fiber raw material with waste water. Objective. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the influence of amphoteric polymer resins (APR) on the fiber content effectiveness on the fourdrinier wire and the pit water contamination degree. Methods. According to standard techniques, the degree of fiber content and water turbidity, which arises in the paper and cardboard production during the formation on the paper-making machine fourdrinier wire, is determined. Results. The graphs of the dependence of the pit water turbidity on the APR consumption for different milling degree for MS- 5 B- 2 and МС- 8 В- 3 waste paper grades have been constructed. The high efficiency of the APR influence on the fiber content degree on the PPM wire is confirmed. The optimal values of technological parameters (milling degree and APR consumption) for the estimation of the APR impact on the pit water quality have been established.

MO methods have been used to investigate dye structures. Specifically, MO based methods have been established that enable investigators to predict 1) the bond lengths and angles of the dye structure, 2) the expected color of the dye, 3) the solubility of the dye, and where applicable, 4) the strength of bonding to metal atoms in the dye structure. Recently, we investigated the conformational space of a series of CI Disperse Red 167 analogs which contained oxalanilide photostabilizer moieties. We found that the unexpectedly low lightfastness of an ethoxy substituted analog could be explained after MO methods predicted the involvement of this group in a hydrogen bonding interaction with the oxalanilide moiety. Molecular mechanics and dynamics simulations have been performed on methyl-pendant PBZT in order to study the effects of intermolecular crosslinking. Several possible crosslinked structures were investigated. The effect of crosslinking was found to be strongly dependent upon crosslink type and, in some instances, crosslink density.

H 577 P ITC 2015 Wongxvii, 271 pages :illustrationsThe {{alarming}} {{increase of}} incidence {{of skin cancer}} has hastened the development and research of ultraviolet (UV) protective clothing. Although various fabric parameters that affect the ultraviolet radiation (UVR) transmission were studied by researchers, most of them focused on woven fabrics and chemical approaches for enhancing UV protection. Knitwear is an indispensable clothing in summer but there were few studies concerning knitted fabrics, in particular the influence of fabric constructions on ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) and structural properties. This thesis aimed at studying the UV protective property of knitted fabrics at a fundamental level by investigating the influence of different knit structures upon UPF with the three main knit stitches incorporated in the cotton knitted fabric constructions, namely, knit, tuck and miss stitches. The impacts of yarn characteristics, fabric constructions, coloration, end-use conditions including stretching, wetting and laundering, on UV protection were comprehensively studied. A metallic biaxial stretching equipment was specially developed {{for the evaluation of}} UV protection of fabrics in stretched condition. The results showed that fabrics with different knit structures have distinct performances in UV protection. A fabric with miss stitches offered remarkable UV protection whereas a fabric with tuck stitches exhibited poor UV protection. The colored knitted fabric with miss stitches imparted relatively better UV protection in a lighter color depth than the fabric with tuck stitches that were dyed in a darker shade. It infers the potential for reducing usage of dyestuffs and <b>chemical</b> <b>auxiliaries</b> in manufacturing UV protective clothing. Besides, knitted fabrics with miss stitches retained good UV protection under the stretched and wet conditions that simulating the daily wearing conditions of knitwear.
