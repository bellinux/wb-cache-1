50|$|Congenital heart defects are {{structural}} {{or electrical}} pathway {{problems in the}} heart that are present at birth. Anyone can be affected with this because overall health does not {{play a role in}} the problem. Problems with the electrical pathway of the heart can cause very fast or even deadly arrhythmias. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is due to an extra pathway in the heart that is made up of electrical muscle tissue. This tissue allows the electrical impulse, which stimulates the heartbeat, to happen very rapidly. Right Ventricular outflow tract Tachycardia is the most common type of ventricular tachycardia in otherwise healthy individuals. This defect is due to an electrical node in the right ventricle just before the pulmonary artery. When the node is stimulated, the patient will go into ventricular tachycardia, which does not allow the heart to fill with blood before beating again. Long QT Syndrome is another complex problem in the heart and has been labeled as an independent factor in mortality. There are multiple methods of treatment for these including <b>cardiac</b> <b>ablations,</b> medication treatment, or altering your lifestyle to have less stress and exercise. It is possible to live a full and happy life with these conditions.|$|R
40|$|Patient {{satisfaction}} and 30 -day hospital readmission rates are metrics {{used to assess}} quality of patient care. Dissatisfied patients pose {{a high risk of}} readmission (Boulding, Glickman, Manary, Schulman, Staelin, 2011) and during the vulnerable discharge period, 1 in 7 patients may experience an unavoidable readmission within 30 -days post-procedure (Jencks, Williams, 2 ̆ 6 Coleman, 2009). Successful patient education programs have been linked to improved patient {{satisfaction and}} subsequently reduced unnecessary readmissions (Murdock 2 ̆ 6 Griffin, 2013; Hansen et al., 2011). In an effort to increase satisfaction and reduce readmissions much of the healthcare community’s attention has turned to interventions that have these primary aims. Increased patient satisfaction and 30 -day hospital readmission reduction post procedure have not been excessively studied in the <b>cardiac</b> arrhythmia <b>ablation</b> population, however these patients often present to their follow up appointments reporting that the procedure was not what was expected and report readmissions that could have been avoided (Ezzat, Chew, McCready, Lambiase, Chow, Lowe, Rowland, 2 ̆ 6 Segal, 2013). Utilizing a framework of the Health Belief Model (Janz 2 ̆ 6 Becker, 1984), an enhanced post <b>cardiac</b> arrhythmia <b>ablation</b> education intervention based on the Project Red framework for re-engineering the discharge process, was delivered to patients in one practice who underwent <b>cardiac</b> arrhythmia <b>ablation</b> procedure with the aim of increasing patient awareness of their disease, clarifying post procedural expectations with the aim of increasing patient satisfaction, and reducing 30 -day readmission rate in this population by providing the patient with education necessary to make an informed medical decision on when to seek care. Results of this study support the implementation of enhanced patient education intervention during the vulnerable 24 - 72 hour post discharge period by showing a higher total patient satisfaction score in the group receiving the intervention (M= 633, SD= 78) compared to (M= 508, SD= 137) in the control group with a statistically significant difference between the means of the groups (p=. 005).

40|$|Catheters are long, {{flexible}} tubes {{that are}} extensively used in vascular and cardiac interventions, e. g., <b>cardiac</b> <b>ablation,</b> coronary angiography and mitral valve annuloplasty. Catheter-based <b>cardiac</b> <b>ablation</b> is a well-accepted treatment for atrial fibrillation, a {{common type of}} cardiac arrhythmia. During this procedure, a steerable ablation catheter is guided through the vasculature to the left atrium to correct the signal pathways inside the heart and restore normal heart rhythm. The outcome of the ablation procedure depends mainly on the correct positioning of the catheter tip at the target location inside the heart and also on maintaining a consistent contact between the catheter tip and cardiac tissue. In the presence of cardiac and respiratory motions, achieving these goals during the ablation procedure is very challenging without proper 3 D visualization, dexterous control of the flexible catheter and {{an estimate of the}} catheter tip/tissue contact force. This research project provides the required basis for developing a robotics-assisted catheter manipulation system with contact force control for use in <b>cardiac</b> <b>ablation</b> procedures. The behavior of the catheter is studied in free space as well in contact with the environment to develop mathematical models of the catheter tip that are well suited for developing control systems. The validity of the proposed modeling approaches and the performance of the suggested control techniques are evaluated experimentally. As the first step, the static force-deflection relationship for ablation catheters is described with a large-deflection beam model and an optimized pseudo-rigid-body 3 R model. The proposed static model is then used in developing a control system for controlling the contact force when the catheter tip is interacting with a static environment. Our studies also showed {{that it is possible to}} estimate the tip/tissue contact force by analyzing the shape of the catheter without installing a force sensor on the catheter. During <b>cardiac</b> <b>ablation,</b> the catheter tip is in contact with a relatively fast moving environment (cardiac tissue). Robotic manipulation of the catheter has the potential to improve the quality of contact between the catheter tip and cardiac tissue. To this end, the frequency response of the catheter is investigated and a control technique is proposed to compensate for the cardiac motion and to maintain a constant tip/tissue contact force. Our study on developing a motion compensated robotics-assisted catheter manipulation system suggests that redesigning the actuation mechanism of current ablation catheters would provide a major improvement in using these catheters in robotics-assisted <b>cardiac</b> <b>ablation</b> procedures...|$|E

Our method uses steerable tensor voting in combination with a catheter-specific multi-step extraction algorithm. The evaluation on clinical fluoroscopy images shows that especially the extraction of the catheter tip is successful and that the use of tensor voting accounts for a large increase in performance. ...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} assess whether renal {{sympathetic}} denervation (RSDN) can be achieved using an off-the-shelf saline-irrigated radiofrequency ablation (RFA) catheter typically employed for <b>cardiac</b> tissue <b>ablation.</b> BackgroundRSDN using a specialized solid-tip RFA catheter has recently been demonstrated to safely reduce systemic blood pressure in patients with refractory hypertension. For <b>cardiac</b> tissue <b>ablation,</b> RFA technology has evolved from nonirrigated to saline-irrigated ablation electrodes to improve both safety and effectiveness. MethodsTen patients with resistant hypertension underwent renal angiography, followed by bilateral RSDN with a saline-irrigated RFA catheter. Ambulatory blood pressure recordings (24 h) were obtained at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months after the procedure. Repeat renal angiography was performed during follow-up to assess for arterial stenosis or aneurysm. In 5 patients, pre- and post-procedural serum measures of renal function and sympathetic activity were obtained: aldosterone; metanephrine; normetanephrine; plasma renin activity; and creatinine. ResultsOver a 6 -month period: 1) the systolic/diastolic blood pressure decreased by − 21 /− 11 mm Hg; 2) all patients experienced a decrease in systolic blood pressure of at least 10 mm Hg (range 10 to 40 mm Hg); 3) {{there was no evidence}} of renal artery stenosis or aneurysm at repeat angiography; and 4) there was a significant decrease in metanephrine (− 12 ± 4, p = 0. 003), normetanephrine (− 18 ± 4, p = 0. 0008), and aldosterone levels (− 60 ± 33 ng/l, p = 0. 02) at 3 months. There was no significant change in plasma renin activity (− 0. 2 mg/l/hod, p = 0. 4). There was no significant change in serum creatinine (− 1 mmol/l, p = 0. 4).

Previously, we have shown that elevated FGF signaling after neural crest ablation causes depressed Ca 2 + transients in the primary heart tube. We hypothesized that neural crest ablation results in elevated FGF 8 signaling in the caudal pharynx that disrupts secondary heart field development. In this study, we show that FGF 8 signaling is elevated in the caudal pharynx after <b>cardiac</b> neural crest <b>ablation.</b> In addition, treatment of cardiac neural crest-ablated embryos with FGF 8 b blocking antibody or an FGF receptor blocker rescues secondary heart field myocardial development in a time- and dose-dependent manner.
