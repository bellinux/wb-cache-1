40|$|Twenty eight western Baggara bulls {{were used}} in this {{experiment}} to {{examine the effect of}} slaughter weight on carcass composition, and carcass parameters, (meat chemical parameters and meat quality attributes). The bulls were divided randomly into four groups A, B, C and D according to weight, each group has 7 animals. The average weight of group A (261 ± 8. 4) kg, group B (330. 00 ± 10) kg, group C (350. 00 ± 4. 1) kg and group D (376 ± 12. 5) kg. After slaughter the hot and cold carcass weight, weight of cold right side, hot and <b>cold</b> <b>dressing</b> percentage, shrinkage percentage, weight of 9 - 10 - 11 th rib cut were recorded. Also weight and percentage of muscle, bone and fat were recorded; lastly the meat chemical parameters and meat quality attributes were recorded. Results indicated that hot and cold carcass weight and weight of cold right side were affected by slaughter weight, hot and <b>cold</b> <b>dressing</b> percentage and shrinkage percentage were slightly affected by the slaughter weight [...] Weight of 9 - 10 - 11 th rib cut was highly significantly different (P< 0. 001) the absolute weight of muscle, bone and fat is increased with increasing slaughter weight. Muscle percentage slightly decreased as in group C(350 ± 4. 1) kg and then it increased slightly in group D (376 ± 8. 4) kg. Bone percentage was not significantly different among groups. The heavier carcasses have a greater percentage of fat than lighter carcasses. Muscle: bone ratio was not significantly different among the groups Slaughter weight has no effect on water holding capacity. Cooking losses are lower for group D than the other three groups. The protein solubility is greater in group C (P< 0. 05) when compared to group D, it was not different vii in the other two groups. Subjective evaluation revealed that meat from lighter animals was more tender (P< 0. 05) than that of heavier animals.

30|$|Current {{clinical}} {{studies have demonstrated}} that cryotherapy after knee surgery may significantly bring immediate benefits by decreasing pain and edema during inflammatory response after surgery, reducing muscle spasm, and promoting knee function recovery; thereby accelerating postoperative rehabilitation and the ability of patients to return to routine activities. To the best of our knowledge, <b>cold</b> <b>dressing,</b> cold packs, crushed ice bags and cooling pads have been used as common and traditional methods. With the development of cryotherapy techniques, CCD could simultaneously provide cold and compression to the knee surgery area; and this has become a routine in postoperative cryogenic nursing. Novel devices that generally comprise of specific cuffs, tubes and coolers make the operation simpler, maintain low temperatures for longer periods, and are more appropriate to the operation area. Compared with traditional cryotherapy, CCD brings not only pressurized therapy, but also extra cost. Therefore, better effectiveness for postoperative management may become the crucial factor for its application. For CCD, it remains undetermined whether compression or cryotherapy could actually reduce pain and swelling (Martimbianco et al. 2014). However, the limited evidence currently available from randomized trials is insufficient to draw certain conclusions on the comparison of CC and CA, in terms of the effectiveness of pain and swelling.|$|E

Steers were finished on summer pasture (Pennisetum americanum) and slaughtered at 16 months of age. No {{significant differences were}} observed between weaning ages for final weight (EW = 360. 0 kg; CW = 359. 2 kg), hot dressing percentage (EW = 53. 76 %; CW = 53. 84 %) and <b>cold</b> <b>dressing</b> percentage (EW = 52. 45 %; CW = 52. 54 %), hot carcass weight (EW = 193. 0 kg; CW = 193. 2 kg) and cold carcass weight (EW = 188. 6 kg; CW = 188. 5 kg). Steers were also similars in carcass conformation, hindquarter and forequarter percentages and others measures of carcass development. The average slaughter weight of steers classified as light, medium and heavy was 338. 7, 358. 6 e 381. 6 kg, respectively.

A total of 300 commercial crossbred rabbits were housed in individual cages from weaning (36 d of age) to slaughter. The feed restriction was based on the administration of a restricted amount of the diet varying from 80 % of the ad libitum intake {{at the beginning of the}} trial to 100 % of the ad libitum intake at the beginning of the 4 th week. The restriction level (about 90 % on average) was obtained by two restriction curves: a day-by-day curve with small daily increments (+ 4 g/d; D group) and a week-by-week intake curve with large weekly increments (+ 23 g/week on average; W group). Mortality was significantly higher in the AL group compared to the daily and weekly restricted groups (20. 7 % vs. 11. 0 % and 6. 5 %; P< 0. 05). Final live weight (on average 2749 g), feed conversion (3. 07), <b>cold</b> <b>dressing</b> percentage (59. 9 %) and other carcass and meat quality traits were not affected by the feeding system. However, the restricted rabbits evidenced increased empty body fat and energy gains (P< 0. 01) as a consequence of the compensatory growth during the second half of the trial. The delay of slaughter from 73 to 80 d of age significantly increased final live weight (2, 647 vs. 2, 847 g; P< 0. 001), reduced daily weight gain (47. 3 vs. 44. 3 g/d; P< 0. 001), increased feed intake, and impaired feed conversion (2. 92 vs. 3. 22; P< 0. 001). Besides, lipid and energy body content raised in the older rabbits (P< 0. 001). No substantial interaction between feeding regime and slaughter age was found. In conclusion, feed restriction improved rabbit health status and did not affect either growth performance or carcass and meat quality, whereas increased the body fat and energy deposition compared to the ad libitum feeding. A progressive day-by-day restriction curve appeared to be less risky and more respectful of the feeding behaviour of growing rabbits in comparison with a discontinuous week-by-week increment of feed administration and permitted to obtain a restriction level nearer to what expected (91 % in D group vs. 93 % in W group). The increase of slaughter age was much more effective in modifying growth and slaughter performance as well as body composition of rabbits than the feeding system...|$|E
30|$|Cryotherapy or cold {{treatment}} {{is the traditional}} treatment, which is affordable, easy to perform and widely applied for acute musculoskeletal injuries. Cold has extensive roles in tissue injury recovery, which mainly include reducing cellular metabolism, delaying nerve conduction, inhibiting edema expansion and alleviating pain (Nadler et al. 2004; Warren et al. 2004; Cohn et al. 1989). To some extent, surgery was been regarded as an acute injury. Therefore, cryotherapy has been gradually applied in postoperative patients. In addition to relieving pain and edema, cryotherapy is also helpful in promoting healing; enabling patients {{to return to their}} regular activities. Several researchers have achieved these exact results, which were obtained through comparative studies that evaluated the effectiveness of cryotherapy in patients after knee surgeries (Cohn et al. 1989; Lessard et al. 1997). Evidence-based medicine studies have indicated that patients undergoing TKA and arthroscopic ACL reconstruction have benefited from postoperative cryotherapy (Ni et al. 2015; Adie et al. 2010; Martimbianco et al. 2014). Since nurses have begun to be involved in decision-making, cryotherapy has become an important postoperative management. Through thousands of years of development and evolvement, cryotherapy could now be applied through different methods such as <b>cold</b> <b>dressing,</b> cold packs, crushed ice bags, cooling pads and cold compression devices (CCD). Due to the facilitation of the operation process, more nurses have continued to select CCD to perform cryotherapy. In fact, compared with traditional cryotherapy, CCD simultaneously brings compression into postoperative management. Several clinical studies on the effectiveness of compression have been performed without inconclusive results, and compression remains {{to be seen as a}} common postoperative intervention (Charalambides et al. 2005; Smith et al. 2002; Andersen et al. 2008; Pinsornsak and Chumchuen 2013; Cheung et al. 2014; Munk et al. 2013). To date, compressive cryotherapy (CC) has been shown to significantly reduce postoperative pain scores after TKA, ACL reconstruction and wrist arthroscopy (Meyer-Marcotty et al. 2011; Markert 2011; Schröder and Pässler 1994). Although cryotherapy has exhibited a clear effect in promoting recovery for postoperative patients, few studies have compared CC and cryotherapy alone (CA). For guidance in postoperative nursing, this kind of comparison has become more significant. The viewpoint on this comparison is very inconsistent in academia at present. The study of Kraeutler et al. indicated that CC by CCD did not reduce postoperative pain in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy (Kraeutler et al. 2015). However, the opposite view for CC has also attracted the people’s attention (Schröder and Pässler 1994). Fortunately, studies that have compared CC and CA in patients after knee surgery are relatively enough to attain a conclusion. Since randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published over the past 24  years, we decided to critically appraise and synthesize existing evidences obtained when effectiveness was compared between compressive cryotherapy and cryotherapy alone following knee surgery. This review would help explore the impact of compression on cryotherapy, assist in clinical and nursing decisions for selecting the optimum cryotherapeutic method, and study the gaps in this area.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of initial feedlot weight on the finishing performance and body composition of Western Sudan Baggara bulls. Forty-five Western Sudan Baggara bulls, representing three groups (treatments) with average initial live-weights and ages of 180. 33 ± 2. 97 Kg (27 months old), 220. 33 ± 1. 29 kg (33 months old) and 258. 33 ± 3. 09 kg (37 months old), respectively. Nine animals were slaughtered {{at the start of the}} experiment, 3 animals for each group as controls. The remaining thirty-six bulls were used for conducting the experiment. These animals were divided into three different groups according to body weight (small, medium and heavy according to initial live-weight). Each group consisted of twelve bulls; each group was divided into three replicates, which consisted of four animals. The animals were fed ad-libitum on a finishing ration in feedlots (molasses based diet) to reach the final target slaughter weight of 255, 295 and 335 kg, respectively (all animals in different weights were kept to gain 75 kg). Data on feedlot performance was collected. The three body weight groups indicated that, the initially heavier bulls made faster gains (1. 17 kg) than the medium (1. 04 kg) and the small (0. 91 kg) and took less time (66 days) than medium (73 days) and small (85 days) to reach the target weight. There were no significant difference between groups in daily roughages intake, total concentrate intake, total dry matter intake and feed conversion ratio. Daily concentrate intake increased significantly (p< 0. 01) with increased initial body weight while the total roughages intake decreased significantly (p< 0. 05) with increase of initial body weight. Nine animals were slaughtered after finishing, three animals for each groups. The data of body composition was compared between the prefinishing groups (Ab, Bb and Cb) and the post-finishing groups (Aa, Ba and Ca). The results indicated that empty body weight, hot carcass weight, cold carcass weight, cold side weight and subcutaneous fat increased significantly (p< 0. 01) as slaughter weight increased. The <b>cold</b> <b>dressing</b> percentage on live-weight basis was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in post-finishing groups than the pre-finishing groups. Gut-fill significantly (p< 0. 01) decreased and rumen full (p< 0. 05) with increase of slaughter weight. The wholesale cuts and longissimus dorsi area showed no significant difference among the different slaughter groups. Muscle to bone ratio increased significantly (p< 0. 05) with the increase of slaughter weight. While the muscle to fat ratio and bone to fat ratio significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased in post-finishing groups than pre-finishing groups and both decreased with increase of slaughter weights. Proximate chemical analysis indicated that meat moisture content significantly (p< 0. 05) decrease with increase of slaughter weight. Protein content (p< 0. 05) and fat content (p< 0. 01) showed a significant increase as slaughter weight increased, while ash content significantly (p< 0. 01) decreased with increase of slaughter weight. Meat quality attributes showed that water holding capacity and cooking loss was found to decrease significantly (p< 0. 01) with increase of slaughter weight. Economically the financial return or margin over production costs from finishing beef cattle starting with initial body weights 180, 220 and 260 kg to reach the target final weights of 255, 295 and 335 kg was generally encouraging for all groups. It was largest when the medium size bulls were finished...|$|E

40|$|Effect {{of dietary}} energy level on female goat kid growth and carcass characteristics: The {{present study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of different dietary energy levels on performance and carcass characteristics of female goat kids. Graded proportions of dietary energy (8. 5, 9. 5, 10. 5 and 11. 5 MjME/kg) were incorporated in four iso-nitrogenous diets for the experiment. Sixty yearling female goat kids of Nubian ecotype with an average initial weight of 16. 54 kg, were used. These kids were divided randomly into 4 groups A, B, C and D in a complete randomized design. Group A was fed the highest dietary energy level (11. 5 MjME/kg) followed by group B (10. 5 MjME/kg), group C (9. 5 MjME/kg) and group D which was offered the lowest dietary energy level (8. 5 MjME/kg). The goat kid groups were fed these diets for 105 days. The dietary energy level had a significant effect on body and carcass measurements, where group D which was raised on the lowest dietary energy level had the lowest values of body measurements while group A had the highest body measurements. Total gain was 9. 12, 7. 81, 4. 75 and 0. 35 Kg/head for group A, B, C and D respectively, which was highly significant (P< 0. 001). The weekly and daily rate of weight gain and feed conversion ratio were also significantly higher in the goat kid group A that was raised on the highest level of dietary energy. Dietary energy level produced significant effect on carcass characteristics as well as hot and <b>cold</b> <b>dressing</b> percentages. Dietary energy level also produced significant effects on total carcass bone and trim tissues which tended to increase with the decrease of dietary energy level. Total carcass fat was significantly decreased as the dietary energy level decreased. The effect of dietary energy level was clearly shown in fat distributed throughout the body of the goat kid. Total body, carcass and visceral fat were significantly (P< 0. 01) decreased with the decrease of dietary energy level. Generally all non-carcass components weights were significantly affected by the level of dietary energy. These components tended to decrease in weight with the decrease of dietary energy level. Yield of wholesale cuts was not significantly affected by the level of dietary energy level, except the breast joint which was lower in group D which was raised on the lowest dietary energy level. Meat chemical composition was significantly (p< 0. 001) affected by the level of dietary energy. Meat moisture and protein content increased, while fat decreased with the decrease of dietary energy level. Meat quality attributes showed significant effect for water holding capacity and cooking loss, indicating that group A which was raised on the highest dietary energy level had superior water holding capacity and lower cooking loss. Meat colour revealed significant (P< 0. 01) effect among the dietary treatments for lightness and redness, indicating that meat from group D which was raised on the lowest dietary energy level was darker red in colour than the meat from the other treatment groups. The meat from goats of group A which received the highest dietary energy level was the most tender compared with that from the other treatment groups. The dietary energy levels induced significant (P< 0. 01, P< 0. 05) effects among the tested groups for taste panel scores of flavour, tenderness and overall acceptability. Meat from female goats of group A which was raised on the highest dietary energy was most tender and acceptable than that from the other treatment groups. Exp. II Effect of rehabilitation of underfed female goat kids on growth and carcass characteristics: Seven kids from group D in the first experiment which were raised on the lowest dietary energy level (8. 5 MjME/kg) were used to study the effect of rehabilitation on performance and carcass characteristics of the female goat kids. These kids were found to maintain their initial body weight throughout the feeding period which lasted for 105 days. These goat kids were rehabilitated on the high energy diet (11. 5 MjME/kg) that was offered to group A and were kept until they reached the body weight attained by group A. They took 175 days to reach that weight. Rehabilitation had significant (P< 0. 001) effect on weekly, daily rate of gains and total dry matter intake which were lower in the compensating female goats than the basal group. Dressing percentage increased significantly (P< 0. 05) in the rehabilitated group. However carcass characteristics were not affected by rehabilitation. Carcass fat, bone and muscles were increased in the compensating group. Gut fill was slightly decreased in the rehabilitated group. Rehabilitation did not significantly affect fat distribution throughout the body, but total body, carcass and visceral fat were increased in the rehabilitation group. All non carcass components were not affected by the rehabilitation except the liver which was significantly (P< 0. 05) increased and the udder which was significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased in the rehabilitated group. Meat chemical composition was significantly affected by rehabilitation. Percentages of fat, sacroplasmic and Myofibrillar proteins increased significantly (P< 0. 01) in the meat from the compensating goats. Moisture, ash, non-protein nitrogen percentages and pH values decreased but not significantly so in the meat from the rehabilitated goat group. Meat from the rehabilitated goat group showed superior water hold capacity and less cooking loss value. Meat from goats that experienced rehabilitation was significantly lighter in colour possibly due to increased fatness. However redness values of the meat, though not significant were lower compared with that from normally growing goat kids. Carcass measurements as heart girth and abdomen circumference were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased by rehabilitation, while measurements, as body length and scapular and thigh circumference were not significantly affected. Taste panel scores for meat quality revealed that the rehabilitated goat group had significantly (p< 0. 01) less odour intensity, less tender meat and less meat colour values than the basal group. While juiciness scores were significantly (p< 0. 05) increased in the meat from the rehabilitated goat group...|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} at the University of Fort Hare farm to assess the effect of dietary supplementation on physico-chemical and consumer sensory characteristics of chevon from South African indigenous goat genotypes. Forty-eight 6 -month-old Xhosa lop-eared (XLE), Nguni (NGN), Xhosa-Boer cross (XBC) and Boer (BOR) castrated goats with a body weight range from 20 to 25 kg were used in this study. Half of the goats in each genotype were supplemented with 200 g/head/day of sunflower cake. The other half of goats in each genotype was not supplemented. The goats were slaughtered at day 90 to determine slaughter weight (SLW), <b>cold</b> <b>dress</b> mass (CDM), meat colour, cooking loss, meat pH and Warner-Bratzler (WB) shear force values. Furthermore, a consumer sensory evaluation of cooked or fried chevon from supplemented and non-supplemented goats was conducted with consumers of different ages, tribes and gender. The XLE and NGN goats had higher pH 24 (P < 0. 05) than BOR and XBC goats. Supplemented BOR goats had higher L* values than their non-supplemented counterparts (P < 0. 05). The other meat quality attributes in XLE and NGN were comparable to those in meat from the Boer goat. Female respondents gave higher (P < 0. 05) sensory scores than male respondents for both cooked and fried meat on aroma intensity. Shona consumers gave higher (P < 0. 05) aroma intensity scores than the Xhosa and the Zulu consumers for both cooked and fried meat. In the non-supplemented goats, fried meat for all genotypes was superior (P < 0. 05) to the cooked meat for initial impression of juiciness. Age and gender of respondents and thermal iv treatment influenced initial impression of juiciness scores (P < 0. 05). The quality of chevon from XLE and NGN was {{comparable to that of}} the Boer goat, and dietary supplementation improved most meat quality attributes. Chevon from the supplemented goats had higher consumer sensory scores than chevon from the non-supplemented goats.
