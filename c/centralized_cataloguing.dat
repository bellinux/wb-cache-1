50|$|Dix's {{commitment}} to the Association of Research Libraries included terms as executive secretary (1957-1959) and president (1962-1963). Dix {{was chairman of the}} Association of Research Libraries' Shared Cataloging Committee. He was instrumental in shaping the Library of Congress' international program of <b>centralized</b> <b>cataloguing</b> and testified before congressional committees in 1965 and 1967 on the need for <b>centralized</b> <b>cataloguing</b> as opposed to the then-current system in which each library catalogued new books using its own sometimes idiosyncratic system.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A new {{technology}} was elaborated, combining a geoinformation system (GIS) and GIS-oriented algorithmic methods of artificial intellect (AI). Numerous thematic layers for geosciences, obtained from Russian and international scientific sources, were imported into the GIS. Technology and software for integration of AI methods within the GIS {{in the form}} of the <b>Centralized</b> <b>Catalogue</b> of Geodata Processing Algorithms (CCGPA) was developed. A GIS visualization subsystem was created to provide interaction between the GIS and its users. It performs geodata layers visualization, map operations, geodata set management, execution of CCGPA-stored algorithms and representation of application results...|$|R

The {{large number}} of {{services}} and the huge amount of information available in today’s large scale distributed systems such as the Internet, make efficient search mechanisms an unconditional issue. Many search methods and engines in such systems have been proposed and are in use. However, {{most of them are}} based on some <b>centralized</b> <b>catalogue.</b> Only recently, distributed search methods have become available in the context of Peer-to-Peer networks (e. g. Gnutellalike systems). This paper proposes a distributed search mechanism based on multiple concurrent search message chains. The method has been evaluated with a stochastic simulation model and with a prototype implementation. The results obtained from both experimentations correlate well, thus showing the viability of the approach. ...|$|R

40|$|Data {{products}} {{derived from}} Earth observing satellites {{are difficult to}} find and share without specialized software and often times a highly paid and specialized staff. For our research effort, we endeavored to prototype a distributed architecture that depends on a standardized communication protocol and applications program interface (API) that {{makes it easy for}} anyone to discover and access disaster related data. Providers can easily supply the public with their disaster related products by building an adapter for our API. Users can use the API to browse and find products that relate to the disaster at hand, without a <b>centralized</b> <b>catalogue,</b> for example floods, and then are able to share that data via social media. Furthermore, a longerterm goal for this architecture is to enable other users who see the shared disaster product to be able to generate the same product for other areas of interest via simple point and click actions on the API on their mobile device. Furthermore, the user will be able to edit the data with on the ground local observations and return the updated information to the original repository of this information if configured for this function. This architecture leverages SensorWeb functionality [1] presented at previous IGARSS conferences. The architecture is divided into two pieces, the frontend, which is the GeoSocial API, and the backend, which is a standardized disaster node that knows how to talk to other disaster nodes, and also can communicate with the GeoSocial API. The GeoSocial API, along with the disaster node basic functionality enables crowdsourcing and thus can leverage insitu observations by people external to a group to perform tasks such as improving water reference maps, which are maps of existing water before floods. This can lower the cost of generating precision water maps. Keywords-Data Discovery, Disaster Decision Support, Disaster Management, Interoperability, CEOS WGISS Disaster Architectur...|$|R
40|$|National Union Catalogue is an {{important}} bibliographic tool {{which can be used}} by any citizen of a country, irrespective of social or ethic differences in accessing about published and recorded knowledge available through the library system of a country. National Union Catalogue (NUCAT) plays a wide role in bibliographic control and library cooperation in every country. NUCAT differs significantly from the other library catalogues in a country with regard to objectives and the services. It is a <b>centralized</b> <b>catalogue</b> which specially provides the physical location of library materials in library collections with the other bibliographic information. Compilation of a National Union Catalogue is only been done by the National Library of a country as a part of its main services. Due to scarcity of fund, constantly changing information techniques and other infrastructure facilities libraries are not able {{to keep pace with the}} fast developing information requirements by its users. In view of these constrains some kind of cooperation between libraries is needed and any library can use National Union Catalogue as a bibliographic tool of library cooperation. The purpose of this study is to identify the effectiveness of the National Union Catalogue as a bibliographic tool to obtain information about library holdings available in Sri Lanka. Data for the study were gathered through structured questionnaires from randomly selected samples of 68 and 50 member libraries and the users of National Union Catalogue project respectively. Findings revealed that the 40 % of special libraries contributed to the National Union Catalogue and the contribution of the University libraries in this regard was 24 %. Researchers and other professionals from various fields were the main users of the National Union Catalogue and their usage of NUCAT showed 24 % and 40 % respectively. 32 % frequently used this facility while 58 % never used this service for fulfilling their information needs. Survey results indicated that 8 % only fully satisfied with the current service provided by the National Union Catalogue. This study concludes that the National Union Catalogue could play a significant role in Sri Lanka with regard to the bibliographic control and library cooperation. Systematic contribution and live participation of all the stakeholders of the NUCAT project is being highly essential to facilitate an up to date bibliographic information service to the users in Sri Lanka. Also the relevant authorities must take necessary steps to increase the usage and popularity of the National Union Catalogue...|$|R
50|$|In {{the midst}} of all this {{groundbreaking}} intellectual work, the Institute also launched a number of innovative programs. In 1962 it began the Child Therapy Program, {{the first of its kind}} in the country. Graduates of the Child Therapy Program have staffed and trained legions of agencies and treatment facilities of all kinds and have been the source of quality child psychotherapy over the last 45 years. A few years later, in 1965, Kay Field began the Teacher Education Program that educated teachers and school personnel about the nature of emotional development and helped them recognize and deal with problems in that development. The program reached hundreds of school personnel. In 1973, under the direction of then-director George H. Pollock, the Institute began the yearly publication of the Annual of Psychoanalysis. It remains the only Institute in the country - and the world - to sponsor, edit and produce an important academic journal. The 70’s also saw the inauguration of the most complete catalogue of psychoanalytic literature assembled to that point, The Chicago Psychoanalytic Index. Begun in 1970 and continued until 1989, this was the standard reference work for most American psychoanalysts until the recent advent of <b>centralized</b> computer <b>cataloguing.</b> The psychoanalytic library out of which this work arose began with the founding of the Institute and grew to be one of the three most complete psychoanalytic collections in the world.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Research data {{management}} plans require {{information about the}} resources used to create, store, and analyze the data. A table of resources in and outside the university was compiled for use when writing DMPTool templates for grants. The table was also {{used to create a}} LibGuide to help researchers learn about all the available resources. Methods: Initially, resources directly related to {{data management}} such as storage availability, sharing options, and database programs available at the university were investigated to find boilerplate language to use in DMPTool data management plan templates. As the data librarian worked on more plans for grant applications, it became apparent that information about research resources related to the creation of data, and resources outside of the university would help provide more comprehensive data management plans, so further resources were investigated. Interviews with researchers had highlighted the lack of a <b>centralized</b> research resource <b>catalogue</b> at the university, so the information collected in spreadsheets by a graduate assistant was used to create a research portal LibGuide for all the documented resources...|$|R
