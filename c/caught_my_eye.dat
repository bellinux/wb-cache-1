500|$|We {{really wanted}} to spend time, immerse ourselves, drive {{for hours and hours}} aimlessly with a camera, jumping out and {{shooting}} things that <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> We didn't want to go there and just shoot Frenchy's Chicken and call it an [...] "authentic video." [...] There was tons of hanging out, getting the feel, all with cameras ready. We hooked up with our dude Scotty who was a great help, plus Bun B's brother Truck, and Paul Wall. The city was so receptive, so willing to help, so open, and that leant a lot {{to the fact that we}} really got to glimpse of the real character of Houston.|$|E
2500|$|Miller {{was part}} of Charlie Company of the 1st Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, a unit which {{took part in the}} Second Battle of Fallujah in November 2004. [...] Los Angeles Times {{photographer}} Luis Sinco took a photo of 20-year-old Miller leaning against a wall, smoking a cigarette. [...] In explaining the photograph, Sinco said that [...] "His expression <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> To me, it said: terrified, exhausted, and glad just to be alive. I recognized that look because that's how I felt too." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 15 May 1942 after photographing German destroyers berthed at {{the port}} of Kiel, Spitfire pilot Flight Lieutenant D. W. Stevenson photographed 'heavy {{construction}} work' near the Peenemünde aerodrome. [...] Later in the month Constance Babington Smith decided the scale was too small ... then something unusual <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> ... some extraordinary circular embankments ... I then dismissed the whole thing from my mind. [...] Then a year later on 22 April 1943, Bill White and Ron Prescott in RAF de Havilland Mosquito DZ473 were sent from Leuchars to photograph damage from Allied bombing at the Stettin railyards: [...] "On leaving Stettin, we left our cameras running all down the north coast of Germany, and when the film was developed, it was found to contain pictures of Peenemünde." [...] The Medmenham interpreters studied the elliptical earthworks (originally photographed in May 1942) and noticed an [...] "object" [...] long projecting from what was thought to be a service building, although it had mysteriously disappeared on the next frame.|$|E
6000|$|We {{made all}} the haste we could down stairs, but we were not quick enough either. Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy smear of eyebrow, who <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> as we advanced, and said, when {{we came up with}} him,-- ...|$|R
5000|$|The track's {{corresponding}} {{music video}} was filmed in Thailand. About her snakelike choreography {{in the music}} video, the singer commented, [...] "Snakes <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> as I studied about the concept of Hawwah. While snakes go slow they suddenly move quickly, and the sensation of their speed was attractive. I tried to capture that part." ...|$|R
6000|$|Charmion {{shivered and}} made answer: [...] "It is true, O Queen; I also {{was of the}} plot, and because Harmachis scorned me I betrayed him; and because of my great love for him I have {{remained}} unwed." [...] And she glanced {{up at me and}} <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> then let the modest lashes veil her own.|$|R
60|$|Here he <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye,</b> and, reading some {{warning in}} it, was silent.|$|E
60|$|A {{gleam of}} white <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> {{through the trees}} by the lawn. I moved towards it.|$|E
6000|$|The passage which <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye,</b> if [...] "axe" [...] be {{substituted}} for [...] "knife" [...] was not inappropriate. It was from [...] "The Nurse's Story," [...] and runs, ...|$|E
6000|$|In a {{very few}} minutes she was back. Her {{appearance}} might have frightened some people, for she was clad only in a shroud. Her feet were bare, and she walked across {{the room with the}} gait of an empress, and stood before me with her eyes modestly cast down. But when presently she looked up and <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> a smile rippled over her face. She threw herself once more before me on her knees, and embraced me as she said: ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{thrill of}} joy passed through me as <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> fell upon the first words. I had wronged her. [...] "Cher Monsieur Vardin." [...] So the letter began. It {{was clearly a}} {{business}} letter, nothing else. I was about to replace it in the envelope with a thousand regrets in my mind for my want of faith when a single word {{at the bottom of}} the page <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> and I started as if I had been stung by an adder. [...] "Verdun"--that was the word. I looked again. [...] "Ypres" [...] was immediately below it. I sat down, horror-stricken, by the broken desk, and I read this letter, a translation of which I have in my hand:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|The question, in four-inch letters, {{exhibited}} on a placard {{outside a}} small newsvendor's shop, <b>caught</b> recently <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> The wanderer through London streets {{is familiar with}} such-like appeals to his decision: [...] "Should short men marry tall wives?" [...] "Ought we to cut our hair?" [...] "Should second cousins kiss?" [...] Life's problems appear to be endless.|$|R
6000|$|He trembled when he <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye,</b> And {{got behind}} a chair. [...] "How came you here," [...] I said, [...] "and why? I {{never saw a}} thing so shy. Come out! Don't shiver there!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father, {{there is}} a light in the sky {{up at the top}} of the hill, just where Carne's Hold lies. I went to the window to draw down the blinds and it <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|I had {{got as far}} as this in {{thinking}} the thing out when that [...] "Types of Ethical Theory" [...] <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> I opened it, and I give you my honest word this was what hit me: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I searched to {{see what}} there was with which I could tie him. I drew the strings from my shoes, and with one I secured his wrists, and with another his ankles. Then I tied the cravat round his mouth again, {{so that he could}} only lie and glare at me. When I had done all this, and had stopped the {{bleeding}} of my own nose, I looked out of the coach and ah, monsieur, the very first thing which <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> was that candle--that dear little candle--glimmering in the window of the minister. Alone, with these two hands, I had retrieved the capitulation of an army and the loss of a province. Yes, monsieur, what Abercrombie and 5,000 men had done upon the beach at Aboukir was undone by me, single-handed, in a hackney coach in Harley Street.|$|R
60|$|Maud’s {{footsteps}} {{were very}} near as his hand fluttered {{for the last}} time and my throat was released. I rolled off and over to the deck on my back, gasping and blinking in the sunshine. Maud was pale but composed,—my eyes had gone instantly to her face,—and she was looking at me with mingled alarm and relief. A heavy seal-club in her hand <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> and at that moment she followed my gaze down to it. The club dropped from her hand as though it had suddenly stung her, and at the same moment my heart surged with a great joy. Truly she was my woman, my mate-woman, fighting with me and for me as the mate of a caveman would have fought, all the primitive in her aroused, forgetful of her culture, hard under the softening civilization of the only life she had ever known.|$|R
6000|$|... "Traitress!" [...] cried one, {{and struck}} at her, {{so that she}} reeled back hurt. Then when all seemed finished, and beneath the rain of blows my senses were failing, I heard the thunder of horses' hoofs and the shout of [...] "Egypt! Egypt!" [...] from the throats of soldiers. The flash of bronze <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> dazed <b>eyes,</b> and with the roar of battle in my ears I seemed to fall asleep just as {{the light of day}} departed.|$|R
60|$|It {{is one of}} the few {{occasions}} when I quite lost my hold on a speech. I glanced sideways and saw the Mayor of Kinghamstead speaking behind his hand to Parvill. By a happy chance Parvill <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Your baggage {{stood in}} the little ante-room, as I passed," [...] said the citizen; [...] "the casket <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> I think you had it of me. It was my old friend Sir Faithful Frugal's. Ay; he, too, had a son--" ...|$|E
60|$|The dog {{was sitting}} on his {{haunches}} on the ground below, watching us, {{and it was quite}} plain to be seen, from his leisurely manner, that it was not his busy day. He bared his teeth and growled when he <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "But I cannot {{see that}} it was dangerous," [...] the girl said. [...] "He could not have knocked me down and beaten me, even if he had <b>caught</b> me with <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> at the peep-hole. He could only have called up Johnstone and denounced me as an eavesdropper, and at the worst I should only have been turned {{straight}} out of the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anneke," [...] I repeated, mentally, and [...] "gentleman {{that will}} cause {{pleasure}} by his appearance." [...] "Can it be Dirck?" [...] I thought. Sure enough, Dirck it proved to be, who advanced rapidly to the group, making a general salute, and finishing by shaking my beautiful young stranger's hands, and addressing her {{by the name of}} [...] "cousin Anneke." [...] This, then, was Annie Mordaunt, as the young lady was commonly called in the English circles, the only child and heiress of Herman Mordaunt, of Crown Street and of Lilacsbush. Well, Dirck has more taste than I had ever given him credit for! Just as this thought glanced through my mind, <b>my</b> figure <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> friend's <b>eye,</b> and, with a look of pride and exultation, he signed to me to draw nearer, though I had managed to get pretty near as it was, already.|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} time <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> hand, so thin {{that it looked like}} a dirty skin-purse full of loose bones, and all the {{business}} of the boat came back to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is obvious}} {{that it has been}} {{tampered}} with," [...] said Mortimer. [...] "It <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> the moment that I passed through the room this morning. I examined it yesterday evening, so that it is certain that this has happened during the night." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{drove off}} ten minutes later. I {{looked out of}} the motor as we swung round into the main thoroughfare. Behind {{the window of the}} little sitting room I saw the pale, almost ghastly face of Lord Porthoning. He <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> and waved his hand weakly.|$|E
6000|$|I {{rose and}} silently gave her my hand. Something low {{down on the}} clean white door-post <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> as we passed it. I stooped, and {{discovered}} some writing in pencil. I looked closer--it was writing in Mary's hand! The unformed childish characters traced these last words of farewell: ...|$|E
60|$|So {{that great}} black dog rushed forward and <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> poor father in its big mouth, {{although}} {{he tried to}} drag himself away on his front paws, and after that I shut <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>eyes</b> fluttered, and I {{could feel}} the blood warm in my face. It was not that he had <b>caught</b> me in <b>my</b> solicitude, but that I had caught myself, and in his presence.|$|R
6000|$|The {{captain and}} myself {{had visited the}} {{abattoir}} of Montmartre {{only a few days}} previously to this excursion, and we had both been much gratified with its order and neatness. But an unfortunate pile of hocks, hoofs, tallow, and nameless fragments of carcasses, had <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> companion's <b>eye.</b> I found him musing over this omnium gatherum, which he protested was worse than a bread-pudding at Saratoga. By some process of reasoning that was rather material than philosophical, he {{came to the conclusion that}} the substratum of all the extraordinary compounds he had met with at the restaurans was derived from this pile, and he swore as terribly as any of [...] "our army in Flanders," [...] that not another mouthful would he touch, while he remained in Paris, if the dish put his knowledge of natural history at fault. He had all along suspected he had been eating cats and vermin, but his imagination had never pictured to him such a store of abominations for the casserole as were to be seen in this pile. In vain I asked him if he did not find the dishes good. Cats might be good for anything he knew, but he was too old to change his habits. On the present occasion, he made the situation of the Abattoir d'Ivry an excuse for not turning up the river by the wall. I do not think, however, we gained anything in the distance, the détour to cross the bridge more than equalling the ground we missed.|$|R
6000|$|Alhadra. A painted tablet {{which he}} held and por'd on [...] <b>Caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> strangely, and as I disturb'd him [...] He hid it hastily within his sash, [...] Yet {{when he started}} up (if my sight err'd not) [...] It slipt unnotic'd by him on the Sand.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is most artistic, and <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye</b> at once. I said to myself,' That is {{the head}} I want, and I MUST secure it if possible.' Can I?" [...] asked Mr. Vane, smiling persuasively as he saw what a frank and artless young person he had to deal with.|$|E
6000|$|... "Anybody calling! I {{should think}} there was--and when I want people they'll come right along," [...] she said. [...] "No; {{you can stop}} out there--isn't all the prairie big enough for you? There'll be some tone about this place before I'm through," [...] and the cook grinned broadly as he <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
6000|$|But Hilda noted it. She {{looked up}} at me hastily. She was sitting {{with her back to the}} window, and therefore, of course, could not see the face itself, which indeed was {{withdrawn}} with a hurried movement, yet with a certain strange dignity, almost before I could feel sure of having seen it. Still, she <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> startled expression, and the gleam of surprise and recognition in <b>my</b> <b>eye.</b> She laid one hand upon my arm. [...] "You have seen him?" [...] she asked quietly, almost below her breath.|$|R
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>eyes</b> {{filled with}} tears. As they did so, I tried to brush them away unseen behind my fan, but Mrs. Carvalho <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> glance, and looked sharply through {{me with a}} sudden gleam of discovery. [...] "Why," [...] she said, very slowly and distinctly, with a pause and a stress upon each word, [...] "I believe {{it must have been}} you yourself, Miss Hazleden." [...] And as she spoke she held her open hand, palm outward, {{stretched}} against me with a gesture of horror, as one might shrink in alarm from a coiled rattlesnake.|$|R
40|$|Microfilm is deadly. Deadly for the eyes, {{the brain}} and, as I {{recently}} learned {{here on a}} research jaunt to Beijing, the stomach. So when a CD booklet on the bar of a Haidian district livehouse <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> weary <b>eye</b> I thought I’d found a good wall ornament for the apartment and a better image to set <b>my</b> evenings <b>eyes</b> on. The only problem was the insert – a black 2 ̆ 6 white sketch of a mass of punks tossing Molotovs at a grinning Mao – wasn’t big enough. I was thinking poster size, so I {{took it to the}} first place that came to mind: my local Beijing Kinko’s. The attendant lifted the thing to her face and, yes, things got uncomfortable. There was no mistaking the message on the graphic’s palace backdrop to the Chairman: fanzui xiangfa, pohuai (criminals minds, destroy). And I felt a bit awkward walking in as an American with this suggestive graphic, so I made sure the staff took in the CD cover: two hands, a bloodied hatchet and the head of George W. Bush. These rockers were clearly out for everyone. The manager and attendant conferred in mutters while a third staffer busied himself with the printed album lyrics, half rendered in English. (E. g. “Kill your Television. We sit back passively as OUR culture is commoditized and force-fed back to us. We have nothing to talk about except TV’s imaginary lives that are safe and sanitized, while the real hours of our own lives are sold away as advertising space to corporations. Our lives become the commodity as the things we buy, the words we speak and the way we live all become reflections of what we watch. Smash your TV and live YOUR life!”; or “We destroy the red dream… The dream turned into a nightmare without end. Now it’s time to destroy this dream gone stale. Smash it up and find a new way!”...|$|R
