The vitrifier {{is being developed}} by Westinghouse Savannah River Corp. and {{will be used to}} demonstrate vitrification of plutonium dissolved in nitric acid for fissile material disposition. The risk of developing a <b>criticality</b> <b>hazard</b> in the off-gas processing equipment can be managed by using available measurement technologies. We identified several potential technologies and methods for detecting plutonium that are sensitive enough to detect the accumulation of a mass sufficient to form a <b>criticality</b> <b>hazard.</b> We recommend gross alpha-monitoring technologies as the most promising option for Westinghouse Savannah River Corp. to consider because that option appears to require the least additional development. We also recommend further consideration for several other technologies because they offer specific advantages and because gross alpha-monitoring could prove unsuitable when tested for this specific application...|$|E

Experimental work was performed with a piece of uranium sheet. The study had four primary objectives. First, gather reaction rate data at a range of processing conditions to compare against reaction rate data reported in earlier studies and recommend a flowsheet for H-Canyon and/or for HB-Line.

40|$|Plutonium- 238 is an {{important}} heat producing isotope which is being used in increasing amounts as fuel in isotopic power generators for space, terrestrial, and oceanographic applications. Only within {{the past few years}} has the quantity of plutonium- 238 become large enough to be considered as a potential nuclear <b>criticality</b> <b>hazard.</b> In order to insure nuclear criticality safety in the storage, processing and assembly of devices containing plutonium- 238, a program has been established at Mound Laboratory to investigate the nuclear criticality properties of this isotope.

40|$|Some time ago, {{a series}} of {{experiments}} (the P- 11 project) were conducted to determine the critical mass of plutonium in variously sized and shaped vessels and with various solution concentrations. These experiments were rather general in nature, hence, {{it is necessary to}} interpret the data to the specific critical mass problems of interest in separation processes. The design of new continuous flow separation processes calls for even further extrapolations of these data to vessel geometries far from the range of present experimental knowledge. The purpose of this report is to review for reference the estimates used {{in the design of the}} critically safe portions of Purex and Recuplex. This report is compiled for engineering use in approximate design; however, any design of vessels involving <b>criticality</b> <b>hazards</b> will be reviewed by the Critical Mass Group...|$|R
40|$|In August 2004, two sealed {{canisters}} containing spent {{nuclear fuel}} were opened for processing at the Hanford Site's K West fuel storage basin. The fuel was to be processed through cleaning and sorting stations, repackaged into special baskets, placed into a cask, and removed from the basin for further processing and eventual dry storage. The canisters were expected to contain fuel from the old Hanford C Reactor, a graphite-moderated reactor fueled by very low-enriched uranium metal. The expected fuel type was an aluminum-clad slug about eight inches in length and with a weight of about eight pounds. Instead of the expected fuel, the two canisters contained several pieces of thin tubes, some with wire wraps. The material was placed into unsealed canisters for storage and to await further evaluation. Videotapes and still photographs of the items were examined in consultation with available retired Hanford employees. It was determined that the items had a fair probability of being cut-up pieces of fuel rods from the retired Hanford Plutonium Recycle Test Reactor (PRTR). Because the items had been safely handled several times, {{it was apparent that}} a <b>criticality</b> safety <b>hazard</b> did not exist when handling the material by itself, but it was necessary to determine if a hazard existed when combining the material with other known types of {{spent nuclear fuel}}. Because the PRTR operated more than 40 years ago, investigators had to rely on a combination of researching archived documents, and utilizing common-sense estimates coupled with bounding assumptions, to determine that the fuel items could be handled safely with other spent nuclear fuel in the storage basin. As older DOE facilities across the nation are shut down and cleaned out, the potential for more discoveries of this nature is increasing. As in this case, it is likely that only incomplete records will exist and that it will be increasingly difficult to immediately characterize the nature of the suspect fissionable material and its <b>criticality</b> <b>hazards...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{tendency}} of Pu(IV) to hydrolyze and form true solutions, colloid solutions, or insoluble precipitates {{has been known}} since the Manhattan Project. Since then, specific studies have been performed to examine in detail the equilibria of Pu(IV) hydrolytic reactions in various media. Great attention also {{has been paid to}} the preparation, structure, and properties of Pu(IV) polymers or colloids. These compounds found an important application in sol-gel technology for the preparation of nuclear fuel materials. A most important result of these works was the conclusion that Pu(IV) hydroxide, after some aging, consists of very small PuO{sub 2 } crystallites and should therefore be considered to be Pu(IV) hydrous oxide. However, studies of the properties and behavior of solid Pu(IV) hydroxide in complex heterogeneous systems are rare. The primary goal of this investigation was to obtain data on the composition and properties of Pu(IV) hydrous oxide or other compounds formed in alkaline media under different conditions. Such information is important to understand Pu(IV) behavior and the forms of its existence in the Hanford Site alkaline tank waste sludge. This knowledge then may be applied in assessing plutonium <b>criticality</b> <b>hazards</b> in the storage, retrieval, and treatment of Hanford Site tank wastes as well as in understanding its contribution to the transuranic waste inventory (threshold at 100 nCi/g or about 5 {times} 10 {sup {minus} 6 } M) of the separate solution and solid phases...|$|R
40|$|This {{criticality}} {{safety evaluation}} provides documentation of {{an analysis of}} the potential for a nuclear criticality event and identifies controls required to prevent the postulated criticality event from occurring during execution of the Operable Unit 7 - 10 Glovebox Excavator Method Project.

The project will be implemented at the Subsurface Disposal Area within the Radioactive Waste Management Complex at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The composition of the waste matrices expected to be retrieved and repackaged during the project supports the conclusion that the probability of a critical system forming is extremely unlikely. However, a criticality scenario can be postulated because no controls exist on the amount of fissile material present or on the introduction of moderating materials. Therefore, controls will b...|$|E

The Atlas V {{will provide a}} medium lift capability in the EELV class of launch vehicles. NPSAT 1 will be mated to the Atlas V using the EELV Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA). The design and operations of NPSAT 1 will require that the space vehicle pose no hazards to ground support equipment, personnel, the launch vehicle, or other payloads. Potential hazards include structural failure, inadvertent deployment of antennas or other mechanisms, inadvertent radio frequency emissions, and other hazards. The scope of this thesis is to assess the safety risks associated with NPSAT 1 for all activities occurring at the launch site through orbit insertion. This includes ground testing at the integration site, as well as in-flight operations prior to and shortly after separation from the launch vehicle.

40|$|The {{administrative}} controls associated with transferring containers from one <b>criticality</b> <b>hazard</b> control zone {{to another in}} the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) Fuel Conditioning Facility (FCF) are described. FCF, located at the ANL-West site near Idaho Falls, Idaho, is used to remotely process spent sodium bonded metallic fuel for disposition. The process involves nearly forty widely varying material forms and types, over fifty specific use container types, and over thirty distinct zones where work activities occur. During 1999, over five thousand transfers from one zone to another were conducted. Limits are placed on mass, material form and type, and container types for each zone. Ml material and containers are tracked using the Mass Tracking System (MTG). The MTG uses an Oracle database and numerous applications to manage the database. The database stores information specific to the process, including material composition and mass, container identification number and mass, transfer history, and the operators involved in each transfer. The process is controlled using written procedures which specify the zone, containers, and material involved in a task. Transferring a container from one zone to another is called a zone-to-zone transfer (ZZT). ZZTs consist of four distinct phases, select, request, identify, and completion...|$|E
40|$|The Savannah River Site (SRS) has 49 {{underground}} storage tanks used to store High Level Waste (HLW). The tank space in these tanks must be managed {{to support the}} continued operation of key facilities. The reduction of the tank volumes in these tanks are accomplished {{through the use of}} three atmospheric pressure HLW evaporators. For a decade, evaporation of highly alkaline HLW containing aluminum and silicates has produced sodium aluminosilicate scales causing both operation and <b>criticality</b> <b>hazards</b> in the 2 H Evaporator System. Segregation of aluminum-rich wastes from silicate-rich wastes minimizes the amount of scale produced and reduces cleaning expenses, but does not eliminate the scaling nor increases operation flexibility in waste process. Similar issues have affected the aluminum refining industry for many decades. Over the past several years, successful commercial products have been identified to eliminate aluminosilicate fouling in the aluminum industry, but have not been utilized in a nuclear environment. Laboratory quantities of three proprietary aluminosilicate scale inhibitors have been produced and been shown to prevent formation of scales. SRNL has been actively testing these potential inhibitors to examine their radiation stability, radiolytic degradation behaviors, and downstream impacts to determine their viability within the HLW system. One of the tested polymers successfully meets the established criteria for application in the nuclear environment.

40|$|The {{storage of}} nuclear waste in {{underground}} storage facilities presents numerous engineering challenges and risks. Experimental verification of engineered underground storage is impractical or prohibitively expensive, leaving scientists with few options. A 1995 report by Bowman and Venneri of the Los Alamos National Laboratory generated considerable controversy by hypothesizing that wastes composed of fissionable plutonium leached from underground storage containers {{could pose a}} nuclear <b>criticality</b> <b>hazard.</b> They proposed cases where plutonium collected in underground fractures could lead to sustained nuclear fission. In overmoderated cases, they argued that the resulting release of energy from fission could result in steam explosions, or even an underground nuclear explosion (autocriticality). Their hypothesis had {{severe implications for the}} feasibility of long-term nuclear waste storage in geologic repositories. The Bowman and Venneri hypothesis led to the need for a study of conditions {{that could lead to a}} critical event in a geologic repository due to releases of uranium or plutonium. Information about the likely consequences of a critical event is also important in repository design. To accomplish this study a numerical simulation code, GEOCRIT, was written to model radionuclide transport from the repository into a fracture below the repository. Once sufficient material has accumulated in the fracture and rock matrix, the neutronics portion of the code is started to simulate heat generation and fluid flow. The thermohydraulics portion of the code calculates heat generation from fission, stream functions, velocity, and pressure of the fluid in the fracture and rock matrix. The transport portion of the code incorporates numerous parameters that can be varied to simulate different radionuclide buildup in the fracture and rock matrix. Variation of the solubility, diffusion, deposition coefficients in the program yield different accumulations of radionuclides in the fracture and rock matrix. In each case the majority of the deposition occurs in the fracture and adjacent rock matrix. The variation in accumulated radionuclides led to different neutron distributions within the fracture and rock matrix. In each case the largest neutron flux is in the fracture leading to the highest temperature also being within the fracture. The increase in temperature leads to a transient bifurcating flow within the rock matrix. One potential risk for the geological repository is the buildup of radionuclide in the saturated rock with subsequent drying out of the rock matrix. This case is known as overmoderation, whereby the neutron flux increases as the water dries out. It has been hypothesized that certain configurations of radionuclides may be overmoderated and drying out of the water in the rock may lead to a critical event. Three cases of overmoderation were simulated with the code. Three different levels of accumulation of radionuclides within the fracture and rock matrix, with subsequent drying out of the crack, lead to an increase in neutron flux. This increase in neutron flux indicates that the accumulated radionuclide in the saturated fracture and rock matrix is overmoderated. In one of the overmoderated cases, the reactor reached a steady state with transient neutron behavior due to water in the surrounding rock changing from liquid to steam and back. One case shows a significant increase in neutron flux...|$|E
40|$|As nuclear {{industry}} continues marching from an expert-base support to more procedure-base support, {{it is important}} to revisit the total risk concept to criticality safety. A key objective of criticality safety is to minimize total criticality accident risk. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to assess key constituents of total risk concept pertaining to criticality safety from an operations support perspective and to suggest a risk-informed means of utilizing criticality safety resources for minimizing total risk. A PRA methodology was used to assist this assessment. The criticality accident history was assessed to provide a framework for our evaluation. In supporting operations, the work of criticality safety engineers ranges from knowing the scope and configurations of a proposed operation, performing <b>criticality</b> <b>hazards</b> assessment to derive effective controls, assisting in training operators, response to floor questions, surveillance to ensure implementation of criticality controls, and response to criticality mishaps. In a compliance environment, the resource of criticality safety engineers is increasingly being directed towards tedious documentation effort to meet some regulatory requirements to the effect of weakening the floor support for criticality safety. By applying a fault tree model to identify the major contributors of criticality accidents, a total risk picture is obtained to address relative merits of various actions. Overall, human failure is the key culprit in causing criticality accidents. Factors such as failure to follow procedures, lacks of training, lack of expert support at the floor level etc. are main contributors. Other causes may include lack of effective criticality controls such as inadequate criticality safety evaluation. Not all of the causes are equally important in contributing to criticality mishaps. Applying the limited resources to strengthen the weak links would reduce risk more than continuing emphasis on the strong links of criticality safety support. For example, some compliance failures such as lack of detailed documentation may not be as relevant as the lack of floor support in answering operator's questions during operations. Misuse of resources in reducing lesser causes rather than on major causes of criticality accidents is not risk free without severe consequences. A regulatory mandate without due consideration of total risk may have its opposite effect of increasing the total risk of an accident. A lesson is to be learned here. For regulatory standard/guide development, use of ANS/ANSI standard process, which provides the pedigree of consensus participation, is recommended...|$|R

The process combines strontium and actinide removal using Monosodium Titanate (MST), Rotary Microfiltration, and cesium removal using Crystalline Silicotitanate (CST, specifically UOP IONSIV{reg_sign}IE- 911 ion exchanger) to create a low level waste stream to be disposed in grout and a high level waste stream to be vitrified. The process also includes preparation of the streams for disposal, e. g., grinding of the loaded CST material. These waste processing components are technically mature and flowsheet integration studies are being performed including glass formulations studies, application specific thermal modeling, and mixing studies. The deployment program includes design and fabrication of the Rotary Microfilter (RMF) assembly, ion-exchange columns (IXCs), and grinder module, utilizing an integrated system safety design approach. The design concept is to install the process inside an existing waste tank, Tank 41 H. The process consists of a feed pump {{with a set of}} four RMFs, two IXCs, a media grinder, three Submersible Mixer Pumps (SMPs), and all supporting infrastructure including media receipt and preparation facilities. The design addresses MST mixing to achieve the required strontium and actinide removal and to prevent future retrieval problems. CST achieves very high cesium loadings (up to 1, 100 curies per gallon (Ci/gal) bed volume). The design addresses the hazards associated with this material including heat management (in column and in-tank), as detailed in the thermal modeling. The CST must be size reduced for compatibility with downstream processes.
