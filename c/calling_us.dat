500|$|Motley {{and fellow}} black {{teammate}} Bill Willis contended with racism throughout their careers. Although the color barrier was broken in all major American sports by 1950, the men endured shouted insults {{on the field}} and racial discrimination off of it. [...] "They found out that while they were <b>calling</b> <b>us</b> niggers and alligator bait, I was running for touchdowns and Willis was knocking the shit out of them," [...] Motley once said. [...] "So they stopped <b>calling</b> <b>us</b> names and started trying to catch up with us." [...] Focused exclusively on winning, Brown did not tolerate racism within the team.|$|E
500|$|In {{their second}} game, the Browns faced the Chicago Rockets at Soldier Field before {{a crowd of}} 51,962 people, an {{attendance}} record for a professional football game in Chicago. It {{was the first of}} many games during which Cleveland's two black players, Marion Motley and Bill Willis, endured racially charged verbal and physical abuse. Some of their white teammates, including Lou Rymkus, retaliated by dealing their own cheap shots. Motley opened the scoring with a 20-yard run for a touchdown, the first in his career. Lou Groza added two field goals in the third quarter, and halfback Don Greenwood ran for a 41-yard touchdown to make the final score 20–6. Chicago's only points came on a touchdown run by Billy Hillenbrand on the first play of the fourth quarter. Motley later said that racism on the field stopped after opponents saw how well he and Willis played: [...] "They found out that while they were <b>calling</b> <b>us</b> niggers and alligator bait, I was running for touchdowns and Willis was knocking the shit out of them. So they stopped <b>calling</b> <b>us</b> names and started trying to catch up with us." ...|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "2112" [...] {{focuses on}} the {{struggle}} of an individual against the collectivist forces of a totalitarian state. This became the band's breakthrough release, but also brought unexpected criticism, {{mainly because of the}} credit of inspiration Peart gave to Ayn Rand in the liner notes. [...] "There was a remarkable backlash, especially from the English press, this being the late seventies, when collectivism was still in style, especially among journalists," [...] Peart said. [...] "They were <b>calling</b> <b>us</b> 'Junior fascists' and 'Hitler lovers.' It was a total shock to me".|$|E

500|$|The Allman Brothers Band have {{generally}} been {{considered one of the}} pioneering bands in Southern rock, although the group distanced themselves from the term. Guitarist Dickey Betts was most vocal about this classification, which he considered unfair: [...] "I think it's limiting. I'd rather just be known as a progressive rock band from the South. I'm damned proud of who I am and where I'm from, but I hate the term 'Southern rock.' I think <b>calling</b> <b>us</b> that pigeonholed us and forced people to expect certain types of music from us that I don’t think are fair." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian, the Sugababes revealed that Austin wrote the song after reading [...] "the cuttings file he was sent about the band". Keisha Buchanan, one of the group's members, elaborated upon this: [...] "All the rubbish and nasty stuff that's been written about us, <b>calling</b> <b>us</b> the Sugalumps, that sort of thing." [...] The title of the song's parent album, Taller in More Ways, {{was inspired by a}} line in [...] "Ugly", which reads: [...] "I grew taller than them in more ways / But there'll always be one who will say / Something bad to make them feel great".|$|E

500|$|On May 9, 2007, {{during a}} show in Fort Worth, Texas Chevelle's trailer {{containing}} all of the band's equipment was stolen from the hotel at which the members were staying. The band posted a notice saying, [...] "Most items are labeled 'Chevelle' and if you notice anything suspicious on eBay or other online resellers selling 'authentic' Chevelle items... guitar, basses, drums, amplifiers, risers, backdrops, tee shirts... please call the police..." [...] A month later in an interview, Sam Loeffler stated, [...] "Of the 14 guitars, we got two of 'em, {{and then we got}} some amplifiers back and our monitor system. So it's really, I mean it's cool because it's kind of like Christmas, only really weird.

500|$|Overmars was {{selected}} in the squad for the 1998 World Cup, staged in France. Before the tournament began, he scored two goals in a friendly against Paraguay. He was on the scoresheet in the national team's 5–0 win against South Korea in the group stage. As the tournament progressed, Overmars felt the Netherlands were [...] "getting better and better" [...] and believed they could win the World Cup: [...] "Believe me, we can do it. In the past, {{there has been so}} much talk about our side and a lot of pressure with people <b>calling</b> <b>us</b> favourites. This time, nobody seemed to expect anything. In fact, people would come up to me in the street and say we were only dark horses to win." [...] While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention. He did feature late into the game as a substitute, but aggravated his injury. He was subsequently forced to sit out the entire semi-final against Brazil, which the Netherlands lost on penalties.|$|E
500|$|Lee Ruth Davis, her sister, and two {{brothers}} were {{hidden by the}} Wrights while their father hid in the woods. On the morning of Poly Wilkerson's funeral, the Wrights left the children alone to attend. Davis and her siblings crept {{out of the house}} to hide with relatives in the nearby town of Wylly, but they were turned back for being too dangerous. The children spent the day in the woods but decided to return to the Wrights' house. After spotting men with guns on their way back, they crept back to the Wrights, who were frantic with fear. Davis later described the experience: [...] "I was laying that deep in water, that is where we sat all day long... We got on our bellies and crawled. We tried to keep people from seeing us through the bushes... We were trying to get back to Mr. Wright house. After we got all the way to his house, Mr. and Mrs. Wright were all the way out in the bushes hollering and <b>calling</b> <b>us,</b> and when we answered, they were so glad." [...] Several other white residents of Sumner hid black residents of Rosewood and smuggled them out of town. Gainesville's black community took in many of Rosewood's evacuees, waiting for them at the train station and greeting survivors as they disembarked, covered in sheets. On Sunday, January 7, a mob of 100 to 150 whites returned to burn the remaining dozen or so structures of Rosewood.|$|E

60|$|Second, As {{it is the}} Father which hath made Christ to us what he is; so it is the Father who hath <b>called</b> <b>us</b> {{to partake}} of Christ and all his benefits. 'Wherefore we must depart from iniquity that profess the name of Christ, that we may glorify him for his call.' (1 Cor. 1:9; Heb. 3:1) He has <b>called</b> <b>us</b> to the {{fellowship}} of his Son Jesus Christ; that is, to partake of all that good that is in him, as Mediator, and {{to be done by}} him for those that trust in him. Nor had we ever come out of a cursed and condemned condition, to Christ, for life and blessedness, but by the call of the Father; 'For it is not of works, but of him that calleth.' (Rom. 9:11) Now since he has <b>called</b> <b>us</b> to this privilege--even us whom he has called--and left others in their sins to perish by his judgments, it is meet we should depart from iniquity. (Heb. 3:1; 2 Peter 1:2, 3) Especially since the call by which he <b>called</b> <b>us</b> is heavenly, and holy, and because he has not only <b>called</b> <b>us</b> to glory, but to virtue.|$|R

2500|$|After Lindros criticized Worley in March 2000 {{for failing}} to {{diagnose}} a concussion (his second of the season), Clarke stripped Lindros {{of the role of}} team captain. A few weeks after suffering a third concussion during practice, Lindros returned to the Flyers lineup for Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals and sustained his fourth concussion of the season (his sixth in 27 months) during Game 7. Afterwards, Clarke said he did not dislike Eric, but he had a problem with his parents, saying, [...] "If he's going to come back, he can't have his dad <b>calling</b> <b>us</b> and telling us who to trade for and who he wants to play with Eric and who can't play with Eric." [...] Lindros never played for the Flyers again, as he rejected the Flyers qualifying offer in the off-season and sat out the 2000–01 season. Lindros pushed for a trade to Toronto but that move fell apart at last minute when Clarke and Leafs manager Pat Quinn could not agree on terms. [...] Clarke finally traded Lindros to the New York Rangers in August 2001. Following the trade, Clarke said, [...] "I don't give a crap whether he ever plays again or if I ever see him again.

2500|$|Switchfoot {{is often}} {{referred}} to as a [...] "Christian band", mostly due to their involvement with the Christian rock scene in their early days. But the band has always shunned this label: [...] "For us, it's a faith, not a genre,..." [...] says Jon Foreman. [...] "...these songs are for everyone. <b>Calling</b> <b>us</b> 'Christian rock' tends to be a box that closes some people out and excludes them. And that's not what we're trying to do. Music has always opened my mind—and that's what we want". Duly, Foreman's lyrics steer clear of preachiness, exclusive declarations of faith, or even any mention of Jesus Christ, instead questioning the status quo, probing existential issues through [...] "Socratic dialogue" [...] in which he answers questions with more questions, exploring frustrations, or simply being inspirational. Even so, this position has not alienated their Christian fans. As in their indie days, they are still distributed to Christian retail outlets through Sparrow Records, featured on Christian radio and charts, and presented Dove Awards, even after having been signed to the mainstream Columbia Records. Spin writer Andrew Beaujon takes the view that [...] "their lyrics often have two different meanings, one meaning for a Christian audience and one meaning for the rest of us. They try to relate to two different groups of people at once".|$|E
2500|$|At the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, Reynolds {{clashed with}} Maj. Gen. Hooker, his {{predecessor}} at I Corps, but {{by this time}} the commander of the Army of the Potomac. Hooker originally placed the I Corps on the extreme left of the Union line, southeast of Fredericksburg, hoping to threaten and distract the Confederate right. On May 2, Hooker changed his mind and ordered the corps to conduct a daylight march nearly 20 miles to swing around and become the extreme right flank of the army, to the northwest of the XI Corps. The march was delayed by faulty communications and by the need to move stealthily to avoid Confederate contact. Thus, the I Corps was not yet in position when the XI Corps was surprised and overrun by Lt. Gen. Thomas J. [...] "Stonewall" [...] Jackson's flank attack, a setback that destroyed Hooker's nerve for offensive action. Hooker called a council of war on May 4 in which Reynolds voted to proceed with the battle, but although the vote was three to two for offensive action, Hooker decided to retreat.
