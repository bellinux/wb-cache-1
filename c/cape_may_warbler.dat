25|$|Birdwatching {{activity}} peaks {{each spring}} (usually April) when dozens of migratory bird species can {{pass through the}} park in a single day. Many birds land inside the parade grounds of Fort Jefferson where they are often observed at close range. Common migratory warblers include the northern parula, American redstart, prairie warbler, hooded warbler, palm warbler, black-and-white warbler, common yellowthroat, yellow-rumped warbler, ovenbird, northern waterthrush, black-throated blue warbler, blackpoll warbler, and <b>Cape</b> <b>May</b> <b>warbler,</b> with more than 20 additional warbler species having shown up at least once. Several raptor species as well as cattle egrets are often seen hunting songbirds. Until early 2013 a small freshwater fountain existed beneath several seaside mahoe and buttonwood trees, and was the only freshwater source for many miles. Maintenance issues necessitated its removal, but a replacement water barrel is scheduled for installation {{in the fall of}} 2013. Each year several bird guides offer tours of Dry Tortugas National Park during April and early May when daily bird lists can often reach 100 or more species.|$|E
2500|$|The Athabasca Plain {{ecoregion}} in the Boreal Shield provides {{breeding grounds}} for the Bohemian waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus), white-winged crossbill (Loxia leucoptera), <b>Cape</b> <b>May</b> <b>warbler</b> (Dendroica tigrina), Canada goose (Branta canadensis) and blackpoll warbler (Dendroica striata). In the south west area of the Boreal Shield ecozone lays the Churchill River Upland which has the second highest population of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). [...] This Upland area is home to waterfowl, such as the common loon (Gavia immer), red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator), {{as well as other}} ducks, and geese on the many lakes of the region. The raven (Corvus corax), spruce grouse, gray jay (Perisoreus canadensis), Connecticut warbler (Oporornis agilis), northern three-toed woodpecker (Picoides dorsalis), osprey (Pandion haliaetus) and hawk owl (Surnia ulula) can be sighted in the boreal forests. The Mid-Boreal Upland ecoregion features these characteristic birds: white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), American redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), bufflehead (Bucephala albeola), ovenbird, (Seiurus aurocapillus) and hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus). The ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), Canada warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), ruby-crowned kinglet (Regulus calendula) and white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), American white pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) are common sightings in the Mid-Boreal Lowland ecoregion.|$|E

In 2004, 315 terrestrial species in the Virgin Islands were on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List (IUCN Red List) of Threatened Species. The islands serve as a wintering ground for birds such as the <b>Cape</b> <b>May</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Dendroica tigrine), Black-throated Blue Warbler (D. caerulescens), and Prairie Warbler (D. discolor).

50|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>May</b> <b>warbler</b> (Setophaga tigrina) is {{a species}} of New World warbler. It breeds in {{northern}} North America. Its breeding range spans all but the westernmost parts of southern Canada, the Great Lakes region, and New England. It is migratory, wintering in the West Indies. This species is a very rare vagrant to western Europe, with two records in Britain as of October 2013. The English name refers to Cape May, New Jersey, where George Ord collected the specimen later described by Alexander Wilson. This species was not recorded again in Cape May for another 100 years, although it {{is now known as}} an uncommon migrant there.|$|E

5000|$|Many of the {{wildlife}} species, are, like the forests, dependent upon natural disturbance from fire and insect outbreaks. For example, {{at least three}} species of warbler (<b>Cape</b> <b>May</b> <b>warbler,</b> bay-breasted warbler and Tennessee warbler), have distributions and abundance related to spruce budworm outbreaks. [...] The black-backed woodpecker shows a preference for burnt over forests, where it forages for insects burrowing in the dead trees that remain standing. Fireweed, as the name suggests, is a plant that similar thrives in recently burned areas. Blueberries and huckleberries are also stimulated by fires, probably benefiting from the removal of shade, and the nutrients released in ashes. The resulting berries are an important food source for boreal forest animals.|$|E
50|$|This bird {{is a small}} {{passerine}} and mid-sized New World warbler. Length {{can vary}} from 12 to 14 cm, wingspan is 19 - 22 cm, and body mass can range from 9 to 17.3 g. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 6.1 to 7.3 cm, the tail is 4.3 to 5 cm, the bill is 0.9 to 1.2 cm and the tarsus is 1.7 to 1.9 cm. The summer male <b>Cape</b> <b>May</b> <b>warbler</b> has a brown back, yellowish rump and dark brown crown. The underparts are yellow, streaked black, giving rise to the bird's scientific name. The throat and nape are bright yellow and the face is striking chestnut with a black eyestripe. There is a narrow white wing bar.|$|E
50|$|The upper Bois Brule valley {{possesses}} many unique ecological {{attributes and}} remains in nearly pre-settlement condition. The river here passes through extensive areas of coniferous swamps and bogs, alder thickets, and sedge meadows. These are fed by numerous groundwater seeps and springs, which contain clean, cold water, {{and keep the}} slopes of the valley perpetually moist, which discouraged post-settlement logging activities. This has led to an exceptionally rich flora, including numerous rare species, such as fairy slipper, northern black currant, small yellow lady slipper, marsh willowherb, and the state-endangered Lapland buttercup. Bird life is also diverse, and includes the following species: boreal chickadee, black-backed woodpecker, gray jay, northern saw-whet owl, <b>Cape</b> <b>May</b> <b>warbler,</b> and northern goshawk. Rare insects found here include the Jutta Arctic, ski-tailed emerald (Somatochlora elongata), and zebra clubtail (Stylurus scudderi).|$|E
