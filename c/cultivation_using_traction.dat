40|$|AbstractDynamic <b>cultivation</b> <b>using</b> a {{radial flow}} {{bioreactor}} (RFB) has gained increasing interest {{as a method}} of achieving bone regeneration. In order to enhance bone generation in large bone defects, it is necessary to use an RFB to expand the primary cells such as bone marrow cells derived from biotissue. The present study aimed to evaluate the cell expansion and osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow cells (rBMC) when added to basic fibroblast growth factor containing medium (bFGFM) or osteogenic differentiation factor containing medium (ODM) under dynamic <b>cultivation</b> <b>using</b> an RFB. Cell proliferation was evaluated with a DNA-based cell count method and histological analysis. An alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay and immunohistochemistry staining of osteogenic markers including BMP- 2 and osteopontin were used to assess osteogenic differentiation ability. After culture for one week, rBMC cell numbers increased significantly under dynamic cultivation compared with that under static cultivation in all culture media. For different culture media in dynamic cultivation, bFGFM had the highest increase in cell numbers. ALP activity was facilitated by dynamic cultivation with ODM. Furthermore, both BMP- 2 and osteopontin were detected in the dynamic cultivation with ODM. These results suggested that bFGFM promotes cell proliferation and ODM promotes osteogenic differentiation of rBMC under dynamic <b>cultivation</b> <b>using</b> an RFB...|$|R

40|$|Mineral oil {{and other}} {{lubricants}} are commonly {{applied to the}} gauge corner of high rails to avoid wheel/rail interface wear on railways. Although not directly applied {{to the top of}} the rail, these lubricants sometimes end up on this surface, and the relatively low coefficient of friction they produce can cause slipping or sliding at the wheel/rail interface during vehicle acceleration or braking. It has been reported in the literature that the application of traction fluid (a modern technique involving the use of a synthetic lubricant) produced a higher coefficient of friction than that of a conventional wheel/rail interface lubricant. In this study, tests were performed <b>using</b> <b>traction</b> fluid to evaluate its influence on a vehicle’s braking distance and other important performance elements from a practical point of view. The results of the braking perform-ance evaluation carried out on a braking test stand showed that the braking distance increase with synthetic traction fluids was roughly one-half of that observed with conventional wheel/rail lubrication oil.
