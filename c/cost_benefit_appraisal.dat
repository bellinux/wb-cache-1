40|$|The {{forecasts}} underpinning {{the construction}} of the Channel Tunnel largely and systematically overestimated the total size and growth of the cross-Channel passenger and freight markets. The share of the cross-Channel markets captured by the Tunnel was accurately predicted. However, this was only achieved through a competitive battle with ferry operators, which resulted in reduced tariffs. The combination of these two factors resulted in revenues much lower than predicted. For completely separate reasons, the construction costs of the Tunnel doubled. The <b>cost</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>appraisal</b> of the Channel Tunnel reveals that overall the British economy {{would have been better off}} had the Tunnel never been constructed, as the total resource cost outweighs the benefits generated. Users have gained significantly at the expense of owners (producers). The latter [...] both ferry operators and the Tunnel operator have incurred substantial losses. The single biggest component of user's gain has not, as originally expected, been in terms of travel time savings, but due to the transfer from producers. The longer-term evaluation of the project confirms the poor viability of the investment both in financial and cost benefit terms. Eurotunnel has in recent months been the focus of much media attention. In the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of April 2004 the shareholders voted to replace the management with a new French-dominated Executive. Project DARE was launched in October 2004, with the aim to address the company's difficult situation. The developments over the next few months will be critical for Eurotunnel, given the approaching end of the Minimum Usage Charge (MUC) period in November 2006 and the start of the repayment of junior debt from 2007. ...|$|E
40|$|The wetland {{areas of}} England are under {{imminent}} threat of drainage for agricultural improvement. The immediate cause {{is the local}} drainage surveys produced under the Water Act 1973. Problems identified in these surveys are subjected to <b>cost</b> - <b>benefit</b> <b>appraisal.</b> Examination of a selection shows that these appraisals are technically defective and result in an overstatement of the benefits and in an overinvestment in land drainage. The main defects are: first, a failure to assess amenity and conservation losses; second, use of prices that contain a substantial element of income transfer which is not netted out; third, a failure to properly calculate the rate of land conversion [...] a crucial variable; fourth, the project appraisal period is arbitrarily chosen or treated as a variable; fifth, the use of theoretical rather than expected agricultural yields; sixth, the level of flood protection aimed at is too high for the stated objective; and, last, anticipated flood losses are not deducted. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an integrated appraisal procedure for new local railway stations. The procedure is not intended to act as a ‘solid state’ set of guidelines, but instead to provide a framework containing current best practice, within which individual elements can be updated and enhanced as new evidence becomes available without affecting the rest of the methodology. The framework includes a number of different elements, which are brought together in an appraisal spreadsheet but which can be altered without affecting other sections of the procedure. First, the best locations for new stations within the study area are chosen, with potential sites selected, catchments defined, infrastructure capacity assessed and potential service patterns planned. Usage at the potential stations is predicted using trip end and flow level demand models, and the extent of abstraction from neighbouring stations is considered. The <b>benefits</b> and <b>costs</b> of constructing the stations are then estimated, including direct financial gains and losses as well as wider economic impacts and social <b>costs</b> and <b>benefits.</b> Finally, these are brought together to calculate financial and social net present values and benefit–cost ratios, with break-even demand levels for new stations also provided. The framework provides a consistent means of estimating the <b>costs</b> and <b>benefits</b> of the large number of schemes for new local railway stations in the UK, and use of a standardised methodology allows those schemes with the best case for construction to be prioritised. Since rail privatisation in the mid- 1990 s the costs of new stations have escalated dramatically, meaning that stations have to demonstrate much greater revenue-earning potential than was previously the case to justify construction. By providing more accurate forecasts and thus reducing uncertainty over scheme <b>costs</b> and <b>benefits,</b> this <b>appraisal</b> procedure can help to ensure that the best return is obtained on the limited investment funds which are available...|$|R
30|$|Present moment attention. This {{component}} {{concerns the}} deliberate directing {{of attention to}} the present moment. <b>Benefit</b> <b>appraisals</b> require that a situation of value be attended to and the present moment provides a major source of novel situations of value (Kashdan et al. 2006). Failing to attend to the present moment forgoes a constant stream of opportunities for new <b>benefit</b> <b>appraisals.</b> Present moment attention correlates with gratefulness (e.g. Loo et al. 2014; Adler and Fagley 2005). It is a key ingredient of mindfulness and several researchers have suggested that mindful attentiveness may contribute to appreciative functioning (Fagley and Adler 2012; McCullough 2002). Indeed, Rothaupt and Morgan (2007) found that practising mindfulness can promote appreciative functioning.|$|R

A key element of the paper is an examination of the range of <b>costs</b> and <b>benefits</b> included in <b>appraisal</b> and the degree of consensus on their measurement and valuation. There is a strong consensus on the treatment of a number of direct impacts, where monetary valuation and inclusion in <b>cost</b> <b>benefit</b> analysis is usual. There is less agreement on the treatment of the environmental and social impacts. Recent developments are in the direction of comprehensive multimodal approaches and a greater use of multi-criteria analysis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this paper presents {{the results from the}} compilation of the national assessment practices in EU 25 Member States and Switzerland. The work was completed as part of the current European Union 6 th Framework project HEATCO (Developing Harmonised European Approaches for Transport Costing and Project Assessment), which has the objective of developing a set of harmonised guidelines for project assessment and transport costing at an EU level. This paper presents the starting point to this project. Based on the work described in this paper the HEATCO consortium will be developing common definitions and consistent valuation methods for the evaluation of TEN projects. Previous projects such as EUNET had conducted a similar review to the research presented in this paper. The key reason for repeating the research was the expansion of the EU to 25 countries in May 2004 and the fact that appraisal practices in many countries has evolved since the last survey. A proforma was designed and sent to country representatives to complete. This paper is based predominantly on the results that this data provided. The proforma focused specifically on the use of <b>Cost</b> <b>Benefit</b> Analysis in <b>appraisal</b> with the aim of identifying similarities and differences in country practice. Aside from the national appraisal framework the proforma also considered the individual impacts included in appraisal. The paper describes some of the similarities and differences in how construction costs, time savings, safety and environmental impacts are used across Europe. The paper then concludes with the key differences and similarities as identified by the analysis. This paper aims at providing an overview of the current appraisal practice and more country specific details are given in Odgaard et al (2005) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{provides}} managerial insight to pursue Collaborative Planning Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR) or Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) strategy {{for both the}} retailer and manufacturer under different supply chain settings. Discrete event simulation is used to investigate the <b>cost</b> <b>benefits</b> of CPFR and VMI strategies over Traditional Supply Chain (TSC) in a variable demand environment. The conceptual model is a two-echelon production-inventory system with a manufac-turer and a retailer. The {{results from this study}} suggest that when compared to TSC, both VMI and CPFR achieve <b>cost</b> <b>benefits</b> in inventory management for both the manufacturer and retailer. Under most supply chain settings, higher <b>cost</b> <b>benefits</b> are achieved in CPFR compared to VMI. Also, CPFR achieves higher <b>cost</b> <b>benefits</b> when demand variability is high, production capacity is low, backorder penalty cost is high and delivery lead time is long.

40|$|Three studies {{tested a}} new model of gratitude, which {{specified}} the generative mechanisms linking individual differences (trait gratitude) and objective situations with the amount of gratitude people experience after receiving aid (state gratitude). In Study 1, all participants (N � 253) read identical vignettes describing a situation in which they received help. People higher in trait gratitude made more positive beneficial appraisals (seeing the help as more valuable, more costly to provide, and more altruistically intended), which fully mediated the relationship between trait and state levels of gratitude. Study 2 (N � 113) replicated the findings using a daily process study in which participants reported on real events each day for up to 14 days. In Study 3, participants (N � 200) read vignettes experimentally manipulating objective situations to be either high or low in <b>benefit.</b> <b>Benefit</b> <b>appraisals</b> were shown to have a causal effect on state gratitude and to mediate the relationship between different prosocial situations and state gratitude.

40|$|Six {{universities}} from Europe, Asia and the United States {{participated in}} {{an evaluation of the}} use of innovation in the port logistics and maritime sector. Led by the BNP Paribas Fortis Chair in Transport, Logistics and Ports from the University of Antwerp, {{the purpose of the study}} was to evaluate the decision-making process and adoption of innovation using quantitative tools. This paper focuses on one of those quantitative tools, <b>cost</b> <b>benefit</b> analysis. Seventy-four separate and highly diverse innovation projects undertaken by private businesses were examined to determine if a traditional <b>cost</b> <b>benefit</b> analysis was used as part of their decision-making process. The data showed that noprojects performed comprehensive <b>cost</b> <b>benefit</b> analysis, although for some projects limited cost effectiveness data were collected after the innovation was implemented. <b>Cost</b> <b>benefit</b> analysis is both complex and time consuming. It is designed for public sector decision-making, where societal <b>costs</b> and <b>benefits</b> are of concern, and where alternative policy actions are evaluated. If these innovations were implemented mainly as a result of internal decisions, use of <b>cost</b> <b>benefit</b> analysis would not be expected. The data show that 37 (50 %) of the innovation projects were undertaken because of external influences, 21 (28. 3 %) were purely internal company decisions and 16 (21. 6 %) were influenced by public subsidy. Several types of innovation projects examined in this research project could be candidates for a <b>cost</b> <b>benefit</b> or <b>cost</b> effectiveness assessment. These are projects where environmental <b>benefits</b> and <b>costs</b> can be quantified, or where quantifiable external benefits support public investment in capital costs or in an operating subsidy.
