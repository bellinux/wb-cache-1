5|$|Specht's {{personal}} emblems adorning his aircraft {{included a}} design by Specht of a pencil superimposed on a chevron (termed a winged pencil) as a wry comment on being deskbound following his injuries. His single-engine aircraft with JG 11 sported a green spinner and a Knight's Cross {{painted on the}} <b>cowling</b> after {{he was awarded the}} honour in April 1944.|$|E
5|$|Two-seat trainer version. Armament {{reduced to}} a single 20mm gun and the oil cooler was {{relocated}} underneath the engine <b>cowling.</b> Fitted with a radio compass and gun camera. Considerably heavier than the fighter at , but it retained the flying characteristics of the single-seat aircraft. 584 built, the last two delivered in 1947.|$|E
5|$|By {{moving the}} pan-tilt {{units of the}} laser range finders, it is also {{possible}} to obtain a point cloud in three dimensions. Technical readjustment between the model of the aircraft and the scene point cloud is already used in navigation to estimate the static placement of the robot. It is planned to make targeted acquisitions, simpler in terms of movement, to verify the absence of chocks in front of the landing gear wheels, or the proper closing of engine <b>cowling</b> latches.|$|E
5000|$|The Sussex type of <b>cowl</b> has an {{elongated}} top plate, giving the <b>cowl</b> a hooded appearance. Sussex type <b>cowls</b> {{could be found}} on Kent oasts, and Kent type <b>cowls</b> could be found on oasts in Sussex. Some oasts carried both types of <b>cowl.</b>|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{reducing}} the external <b>cowl</b> angle, and hence the <b>cowl</b> pressure drag, were investigated on a two-dimensional model. One method used at both on- and off-design Mach numbers was {{the addition of a}} <b>cowl</b> visor that had the inner surface parallel to the free stream at 0 deg angle of attack. The other method investigated consisted in replacing the original <b>cowl</b> by a flatter <b>cowl</b> that also provided internal contraction. Both the visor and the internal-contraction <b>cowl</b> reduced the <b>cowl</b> pressure drag 64 percent or more. The visor had little effect on inlet performance at the design Mach number except to reduce the stability range slightly. At off-design, the visor caused an increase in critical pressure recovery...|$|R
50|$|The Thunderbolts then {{defeated}} the Crimson <b>Cowl's</b> Masters of Evil {{and took over}} their headquarters. After unmasking the Crimson <b>Cowl,</b> the team discovered that she was their old friend Dallas Riordan. In truth, Riordan was not the Crimson <b>Cowl.</b> The real Crimson <b>Cowl</b> was Justine Hammer. Riordan had been framed by Hammer to take the fall for the <b>Cowl's</b> crimes. While Riordan was not the Crimson <b>Cowl,</b> she did have her own secret identity. Riordan was actually the new Citizen V, leader of the secret V-Battalion. Riordan decided to keep her secret to avoid exposure of the group. She was sent to jail for the Crimson <b>Cowl's</b> crimes. She would later be rescued by the V-Battalion.|$|R
5|$|Gale married Henrietta Roper, the {{daughter}} of Henry Roper of <b>Cowling,</b> Kent. She died in 1720. They had one son, Roger Henry Gale, {{who was born in}} 1710. Gale himself died on 25 June 1744 at his estates in Scruton, and was buried near the church there. There is no monument in the churchyard, as he stipulated in his will that he be buried in such a manner that no one would know exactly where he was buried.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} livery is {{in white}} color {{with a red}} dragon on the <b>cowling</b> and on the vertical stabiliser; and the airline's name written in Chinese red lettering and in English black lettering {{above and below the}} front passenger windows, respectively. In addition, there is a 30cm Oneworld logo next to the first left door and a Swire Group logo on the aft of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Designs were {{submitted}} {{in response to}} the Navy's specifications by Vought-Sikorsky and Curtiss-Wright. The Vought design, designated Model 403 by the company, was similar to the company's OS2U Kingfisher, which was then under development to replace the SOC aboard U.S. Navy battleships, but had its monoplane wing moved higher on the fuselage than that of the Kingfisher, and differed in the attachment method used by its single-float landing gear. In addition, the radial engine of the OS2U was replaced by an inline Ranger V-770 in a squared-off <b>cowling.</b>|$|E

40|$|A thrust {{reverser}} is provided for both modulating and reversing bypass flow discharged from a fan through a bypass duct of a turbofan gas turbine engine. The reverser includes an aft <b>cowl</b> joined to a forward <b>cowl</b> and having an aft end surrounding a core engine {{to define a}} discharge fan nozzle of minimum flow throat area. The aft <b>cowl</b> is axially translatable relative to the forward <b>cowl</b> from a first position fully retracted against the forward <b>cowl,</b> to a second position partially extended from the forward <b>cowl,</b> and to a third position fully extended from the forward <b>cowl.</b> A plurality of cascade turning vanes are disposed between the forward and aft <b>cowls,</b> and a plurality of thrust reversing deflector doors are pivotally mounted to the aft <b>cowl</b> and bound the bypass duct. The deflector doors are selectively deployed from a stowed position corresponding with {{the first and second}} positions of the aft <b>cowl</b> for allowing unrestricted flow of the bypass flow through the fan nozzle. The doors also have a deployed position corresponding with the third position of the aft <b>cowl</b> for substantially deflecting the bypass flow from discharging through the fan nozzle to discharging through the cascade vanes for effecting thrust reverse. Axial translation of the aft <b>cowl</b> {{between the first and second}} positions varies flow area of the fan nozzle to vary thrust effected by the discharged bypass flow...|$|R
5|$|During {{the first}} year of his administration, Jones and five others were {{traveling}} in a state helicopter from Frankfort to Fort Knox when a tail rotor blade snapped, causing the helicopter to crash in Shelby County. The pilot was able to guide the helicopter into a treetop to soften the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and a bruised kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and co-pilot had not properly attached an engine <b>cowling</b> that knocked off the tail rotor blade. Both pilots maintained that they did nothing wrong, and Jones credited them for the survival of the passengers aboard the helicopter.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010 diving {{operations}} {{were carried out}} and the survey report indicated that the aircraft was largely complete, although 5K+AR lay inverted on the seabed, indicating that it ground-looped on landing. The port rudder, starboard stabiliser, forward nose glazing, undercarriage doors and engine <b>cowling</b> were missing, but {{the discovery of a}} small debris field associated with the wreck indicates that some or all of those parts may still be present at the site. Some items, including two of the Dornier's six MG 15 machine guns, are missing and are believed to have been stolen by unauthorized divers sometime after the aircraft's discovery.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1917, {{the rotary}} engine F.I {{prototype}} {{was assigned to}} Voss as his personal aircraft. In his childhood, Voss had flown Japanese fighting kites with his cousins in Krefeld; the decorations on the kites gave him the inspiration to paint the nose <b>cowling</b> of his triplane with two eyes, eyebrows and a moustache. The arrival of the new fighter brought celebrities visiting. On 31 August, Anthony Fokker escorted German Chancellor Georg Michaelis and Major General Ernst von Lossberg to see and film the new triplane. On 9 September, Crown Prince Wilhelm would also visit Jasta 10.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical study {{is presented to}} show the effect of <b>cowl</b> length and angle on the ramp/cowl shock interaction phenomena fora two-dimensional planar scramjet inlet model. Experiments areconducted in a hypersonic shock tunnel, at Mach 8, at four lengths of owl and three <b>cowl</b> angles. Investigations include schlieren flow Visualization near the <b>cowl</b> region and static pressure and heat transfer rate measurement inside the inlet chamber. Various ramp/cowl shock interaction processes resulted for different <b>cowl</b> configurations have been visualized using a high-speed camera. Edney type-II interference pattern is observed for 131 and 141 -mm <b>cowl</b> lengths,whereas it is an Edney type-I interference pattern {{in case of a}} 151 mm <b>cowl</b> with all their typical features resulting because of the ramp/cowl shock interaction. Experiments with a <b>cowl</b> configuration other than 0 deg show the flow to he established through the inlet because or the reduced contraction ratio. Heat transfer peaks can be observed for the 10 and 20 -deg <b>cowl</b> cases where flow through the inlet is found to be established. These may serve as the possible locations of fuel injection...|$|R
5|$|In {{terms of}} intake, by 1937 there were 201 undergraduates; {{it was a}} uniform {{selection}} that was almost completely middle class, {{like the rest of}} the University. Over 60% of entrants came from independent schools, perhaps because of the £250 a year cost of reading towards a degree. It had, unlike some other college, students from several other nations: Muhammad Aslam Khan Khattak and Abbas Khaleeli from British India among them. Students were varied: Baptist Thomas George <b>Cowling</b> became an astronomer and member of the Royal Society, in contrast, Jew Paul Dehn went on to become a film critic and screenwriter. Other alumni of this period include Charles Langbridge Morgan, Edward Atiyah and William Golding.|$|E
5|$|By this time, the Soviet {{pilots were}} {{familiar}} with Hartmann's radio call sign of Karaya 1, and the Soviet Command had put a price of 10,000 rubles on the German pilot's head. Hartmann, for a time, used a black tulip design around the engine <b>cowling</b> near the spinner of his aircraft, so Soviet personnel consequently nicknamed him Cherniy Chort ("Black Devil"). However, Hartmann's opponents were often reluctant to stay and fight if they noticed his personal design. As a result, this aircraft was often allocated to novices, who could fly it in relative safety. On 21 March, it was Hartmann who scored JG52s 3,500th victory of the war. Adversely, the reluctance of the Soviet airmen to fight caused Hartmann's kill rate to drop. Hartmann then had the tulip design removed, and his aircraft painted {{just like the rest}} of his unit. Consequently, in the following two months, Hartmann amassed over 50 victories.|$|E
5|$|The I-211 was {{a direct}} descendent of the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-210 high-altitude fighter prototype, {{also known as the}} MiG-3-82 or MiG-9. Late in 1941, a {{decision}} was made to phase out production of the Mikulin AM-35A engine used by the MiG-1 and MiG-3 in favor of the Mikulin AM-38 engine used in the Ilyushin Il-2. The MiG design team had already created a version of the MiG-3 called the I-210, using a Shvetsov ASh-82 radial engine instead of the inline, liquid-cooled engine. A number of changes were made in order to accommodate the larger circumference of the radial engine, but the redesign of the engine <b>cowling</b> was a failure and the I-210 proved to be slower than the Yak-1 or the LaGG-3 when it first flew on 23 July 1941.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the fan <b>cowl,</b> particularly the material {{of which it is}} made, on the acoustic noise emitted from PWM controlled induction machines is investigated. It is shown that there are significant harmonic excitation forces which can cause mechanical resonances of the fan <b>cowl.</b> The mechanical behaviour of both metal and plastic <b>cowls</b> is measured, using impulse force tests and random PWM excitation. The noise spectra and sound pressure level of a 1. 5 kW 3 -phase induction machine when equipped with a metal and a plastic fan <b>cowl</b> are investigated, and the noise spectra when the machine is supplied from sub-harmonic PWM, space vector PWM and random PWM inverter are compared. It shows that a metal fan <b>cowl</b> can significantly amplify the noise level, whilst the noise level with a plastic fan <b>cowl</b> is effectively the same as that with the <b>cowl</b> removed...|$|R

5000|$|Mainly the <b>cowl</b> conceals Batman's {{features}} {{and contributes to}} his imposing appearance. There may be something added to the <b>cowl</b> that alters how people see Batman when looking at him directly. Batman's <b>cowl</b> has sometimes served other purposes. Occasionally, the <b>cowl</b> is depicted as having defense mechanisms such as electric shock or stun gas {{in order to prevent}} unauthorized removal (as shown in The Dark Knight, Batman: Hush, Superman/Batman and Justice League of America #24). In Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne mail orders the materials to build the <b>cowl</b> through a maze of untraceable shell companies. To avoid suspicion, Wayne orders very large quantities of 10,000, each part sent to different location, and under different aliases. However, because some meta-human criminals have the power to see through solid objects, Batman also lines the <b>cowl</b> with lead to protect his identity. That property is absent in The New Batman/Superman Adventures crossover [...] "World's Finest", where Superman saw through Batman's <b>cowl</b> with ease.|$|R
5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal <b>cowling</b> that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an empty weight only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|E
5|$|The Seafire, a name {{derived from}} sea, and Spitfire, was a naval {{version of the}} Spitfire {{specially}} adapted for operation from aircraft carriers. Although the Spitfire was not designed for the rough-and-tumble of carrier-deck operations, it was considered the best available fighter at the time. The basic Spitfire design did impose some limitations {{on the use of}} the aircraft as a carrier-based fighter; poor visibility over the nose, for example, meant that pilots had to be trained to land with their heads out of the cockpit and looking along the port <b>cowling</b> of their Seafire. Like the Spitfire, the Seafire also had a relatively narrow undercarriage track, which meant that it was not ideally suited to deck operations. Early marks of Seafire had relatively few modifications to the standard Spitfire airframe; however cumulative front line experience meant that most of the later versions of the Seafire had strengthened airframes, folding wings, arrestor hooks and other modifications, culminating in the purpose-built Seafire F/FR Mk 47.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after takeoff}} at 16.27 BST (15.27 GMT) on 8 April 1968, {{according}} to the investigations of Rolls-Royce, the 5th stage low-pressure compressor wheel failed in fatigue at the run out radius of the wheel web with the rim, causing secondary failures to other wheels {{and other parts of}} the engine. The wheel then burst through its casing and disconnected the main fuel pipe, igniting the fuel which was being pumped at 50 gallons (approx. 150kg) per minute. The fire could not be put out because the engine's two extinguishers had become ineffectual following the destruction caused to the engine <b>cowling</b> by the broken compressor casing. The ferocity of the blaze soon after caused the engine pylon to fatally weaken, which when it gave way, led to the engine falling off of the wing. However, the fuel booster pump continued to function, intensifying the fire until it spread to the wing itself, sweeping back from forward of the leading edge towards the tail. Upon landing, the application of reverse thrust and the westerly crosswind on runway 05R blew the flames underneath the wing and set light to the fuselage. The rapidly intensifying fire then spread under the plane and ignited the fuel lines and oxygen tanks, which, within seconds of the aircraft coming to a stop, caused a series of explosions that broke through the fuselage and set fire to the cabin, ultimately resulting in the deaths of five people.|$|E
40|$|Pressure {{distributions}} {{on three}} inlets having di erent <b>cowl</b> lengths were {{obtained in the}} Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel. The <b>cowl</b> diameter ratio (highlight diameter to maximum diameter) was 0. 85, and the <b>cowl</b> length ratios (<b>cowl</b> length to maximum diameter) were 0. 337, 0. 439, and 0. 547. The <b>cowls</b> had identical nondimensionalized (with respect to <b>cowl</b> length) external geometry and identical internal geometry. The internal contraction ratio (highlight area to throat area) was 1. 250. The inlets had longitudinal rows of static-pressure ori ces {{on the top and}} bottom (external) surfaces and on the contraction (internal) and di user surfaces. The afterbody was cylindrical in shape, and its diameter was equal to the maximum diameter of the <b>cowl.</b> Depending on the <b>cowl</b> con guration and free-stream Mach number, the mass- ow ratio varied between 0. 27 and 0. 87 during the tests. Angle of attack varied from 0 to 4. 1 at selected Mach numbers and mass- ow ratios, and the Reynolds number varied with the Mach number from 3. 2 2 10 6 to 4. 2 2 10 6 per foot...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{and maintenance of}} <b>cowls</b> was generally {{the job of a}} wheelwright. To remove a <b>cowl,</b> a <b>cowl</b> pole would be bolted to one of the main beams of the kiln, and the top would protrude {{from the top of the}} kiln. A rope would be passed over the pulley at the top of the <b>cowl</b> pole and tied around the <b>cowl.</b> The finger would be removed, and the coach bolt securing the centre post to the backboard undone. The <b>cowl</b> could then be lifted off the tenon at the top of the centre post and lowered down the kiln. Ropes were also tied at each end of the tie beam if present. The <b>cowl</b> could either be lowered inverted, or alternatively, a ladder would be placed against the kiln roof and the <b>cowl</b> be carried down by the wheelwright, the weight being mainly taken by those in the kiln working on the rope. It was important to avoid damaging the kiln roof. Replacement was a reversal of the above process. A series of illustrations showing the process can be found here. The modern method involves using a mobile crane.|$|R
