5|$|Despite {{the common}} {{period in which}} castles rose to {{prominence}} in Europe, their form and design varied from region to region. In the early 11thcentury, the motte and keep– an artificial mound surmounted by a palisade and tower– was the most <b>common</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> castle in Europe, everywhere except Scandinavia. While Britain, France, and Italy shared a tradition of timber construction that was continued in castle architecture, Spain more commonly used stone or mud-brick as the main building material.|$|E
5|$|Detection of {{particular}} antibodies {{is a very}} <b>common</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> medical diagnostics, and applications such as serology depend on these methods. For example, in biochemical assays for disease diagnosis, a titer of antibodies directed against Epstein-Barr virus or Lyme disease is estimated from the blood. If those antibodies are not present, either the person is not infected or the infection occurred {{a very long time}} ago, and the B cells generating these specific antibodies have naturally decayed.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinoma, {{which usually}} {{originates}} in peripheral lung tissue.

A subtype of adenocarcinoma, the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, is more common in female never-smokers, and may have a better long-term survival.|$|E

Ticks are ectoparasites (external parasites), living by feeding on the blood of mammals, birds, and sometimes reptiles and amphibians. Ticks had evolved by the Cretaceous period, the most <b>common</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> fossilisation being immersed in amber.

5|$|About 150 {{million people}} {{developed}} a {{urinary tract infection}} each year. They are more common in women than men.

Up to 10% of women have a urinary tract infection in a given year and half of women having at least one infection {{at some point in their}} lives. They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35years. Recurrences are common. Urinary tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the Ebers Papyrus dated to c. 1550 BC.|$|E
5|$|Adjectives are inflected in two declensions—{{indefinite}} and definite—and {{they must}} match the noun they modify in gender and number. The indefinite neuter and plural forms of an adjective are usually created {{by adding a}} suffix (-t or -a) to the <b>common</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the adjective, e.g., en grön stol (a green chair), ett grönt hus (a green house), and gröna stolar ("green chairs").

5|$|Amphetamine is {{frequently}} measured in urine or blood {{as part of}} a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is the most <b>common</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E
5|$|Arable farming {{grew in the}} High Middle Ages and {{agriculture}} entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century. Unlike England, Scotland had no towns dating from Roman occupation. From the twelfth century there are records of burghs, chartered towns, which became major centre of crafts and trade. There are also Scottish coins, although English coinage probably remained more significant in trade, and {{until the end of}} the period barter was probably the most <b>common</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> exchange. Craft and industry remained relatively undeveloped before the end of the Middle Ages and, although there were extensive trading networks based in Scotland, while the Scots exported largely raw materials, they imported increasing quantities of luxury goods, resulting in a bullion shortage and perhaps helping to create a financial crisis in the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{differ from}} {{bacteria}} in both their genetics and biochemistry. For example, while bacterial cell membranes {{are made from}} phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, archaean membranes are made of ether lipids. Archaea were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in all types of habitats. Only now are scientists beginning to realize how common archaea are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being the most <b>common</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth.
