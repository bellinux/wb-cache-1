40|$|<b>Conventional</b> <b>liability</b> {{rules do}} {{not lead to}} a first best allocation. Optimal {{bilateral}} risk control can be achieved by not compensating any losses and, in addition, charging each party a fine equal to the loss suffered by the other party. In this way, each party internalizes the full accident loss. This paper investigates the properties of this â€œdouble liabilityâ€ rule under risk neutrality and risk aversion of the parties. Finally the use of this rule in the context of multiple-party accidents is discussed. The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance Theory (1990) 15, 159 – 169. doi: 10. 1007 /BF 01489707...|$|E
40|$|Accidents {{involving}} vessels carrying oil {{or other}} hazardous and noxious substances {{have been in}} many cases the cause of spillage with devastating consequences on the local economic and the environment. This was highlighted by the Torrey Canyon incident, in March 1967, which proved that there is inadequate legal means, at international level, to cope with the problems in the recovery of the considerable expenditure involved in taking preventive measures, cleaning up and damage to the third parties and the environment. This thesis is an attempt to explore, analyse and develop a legal framework aimed at compensating and insuring against pollution liability at sea. The international response in providing liability and compensation and the role of insurance in solving these problems has been carefully considered throughout this thesis. This thesis is divided in 5 parts beginning with an introduction and ending with a conclusion and bibliography. Part one, which comprises six chapters, seeks to overview the range of legal cases whereby liability for compensation and insurance of pollution damage may be established. The role of Tort or Delict, principally Negligence, Trespass and Nuisance, in establishing liability forms section one of this part. Chapter two outlines the role of two voluntary agreements, TOVALOP and CRISTAL, in settling the question of the liability and financial cover of the casts of oil spillage by tankers. A descriptive and analytical approach, regarding the compensation and insurance, is linked to the discussion of mandatory <b>conventional</b> <b>liability</b> for oil and other noxious substances. This is considered in chapter three, chapter four and chapter five, under the MARPOL 73 / 78, CLC, FC and HNS in full. Chapter six considers the place of liability cover in the marine insurance market and seeks to find a place for pollution liability cover...|$|E
40|$|Without {{affordable}} reinsurance, private {{crop insurance}} markets {{are doomed to}} fail because systemic weather effects induce high correlation among farm-level yields, defeating insurer efforts to pool risks across farms. Using an empirical model of the U. S. crop insurance market, we find that U. S. crop insurer portfolios are twenty to fifty times riskier {{than they would be}} otherwise if yields were stochastically independent across farms. We also find that area yield reinsurance contracts would enable crop insurers to cover most of their systemic crop loss risk, reducing their risk exposure to levels typically experienced by more <b>conventional</b> property <b>liability</b> insurers.

40|$|International audienceFirms will exert {{too little}} care {{due to a}} limited {{liability}} effect if damages are likely to exceed their equity. This is particularly important for environmental and product liability and motivates the current discussion about mandatory insurance and extending liability to creditors. We model {{the choice of the}} care level as a moral hazard problem that can be solved through costly monitoring. <b>Conventional</b> strict <b>liability</b> and lender liability both lead to distortions in the capital structure and to inefficiently low care. By contrast, mandatory liability coverage (financial responsibility) that can be satisfied by either an insurance contract or a lender guarantee leads to the first best allocation if managers can self-insure, and to the second best if managers cannot self-insure but choose to be monitored...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} new updated {{and improved}} estimates of various components of governments' contribution to national wealth and its {{growth in the}} post-war period. The primary conclusions drawn are: (1). The federal government's assets, tangible and financial, are substantial; they grew more rapidly than the national debt in the 1970 s. By 1980, federal tangible assets amounted to $ 1. 7 trillion and financial assets $ 940 billion, compared to liabilities of $ 1. 5 trillion (in 1985 dollars); (2). Since 1980, <b>conventional</b> <b>liabilities</b> have grown much faster than assets, causing about a $ 727 billion decline in federal "net worth"; (3). The state-local government sector contributes importantly to government and national wealth. State-local fixed reproducible capital is twice the federal amount, about $ 1. 9 trillion in 1985. The difference between assets and liabilities is both larger and more stable for state-local governments than for the federal government. The estimated "net worth" of state-local governments is $ 2. 5 trillion in both 1980 and 1985; 4. Total government reproducible capital was about 55 % of the corresponding private non-residential capital stock in 1985; 5. Government net investment has often been sufficient to turn the government sector into a net saver despite large budget deficits; 6. Extending the traditional National Income Accounts to include imputed returns to government capital and consumer durables while treating government net investment and durables purchases as saving indicate that the share of national output devoted to consumption has risen substantially, while that devoted to net saving has fallen sharply in the period 1951 - 85. The private consumption rate has risen from 63 % to 69 % over this period while the government consumption rate has fallen slightly; 7. The inclusion of consumer durables and government tangible investment raises the national saving rate substantially. In 1985, the gross and net saving rates rise from a traditionally measured 13. 8 % and 3. 2 % to 24. 5 % and 8. 8 %, respectively (about {{one and a half}} percentage points of this increase is due to our different depreciation methodology). Thus, the data presented in this paper reveal much about the post-war fiscal history of the United States. In addition to their importance in understanding trends in national wealth, they may also prove important inputs into future studies of the long-term growth of the economy and to the short-run effects of fiscal policy. ...|$|R
40|$|Heritability {{is often}} {{estimated}} by decomposing {{the variance of}} a trait into genetic and other factors. Interpreting such variance decompositions, however, is not straightforward. In particular, there is an ongoing debate {{on the importance of}} genetic factors in cancer development, even though heritability estimates exist. Here we show that heritability estimates contain information on the distribution of absolute risk due to genetic differences. The approach relies on the assumptions underlying the <b>conventional</b> heritability of <b>liability</b> model. We also suggest a model unrelated to heritability estimates. By applying these strategies, we describe the distribution of absolute genetic risk for 15 common cancers. We highlight the considerable inequality in genetic risk of cancer using different metrics, e. g., the Gini Index and quantile ratios which are frequently used in economics. For all these cancers, the estimated inequality in genetic risk is larger than the inequality in income in the USA...|$|R
40|$|The main {{difficulty}} with the data-domain full waveform inversion (FWI) is that it tends to get stuck in the local minima associated with the waveform misfit function. This {{is the result of}} cycle skipping which degrades the low-wavenumber update in the absence of low-frequencies and long-offset data. An image-domain objective function is defined as the normed difference between the predicted and observed common image gathers (CIGs) in the subsurface offset domain. This new objective function is not constrained by cycle skipping at the far subsurface offsets. To test the effectiveness of this method, we apply it to marine data recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. Results show that image-domain FWI is less sensitive to the initial model and the absence of low-frequency data compared with <b>conventional</b> FWI. The <b>liability,</b> however, is that it is almost an order of magnitude more expensive than standard FWI...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of loss reserves for incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims presents an important task for {{insurance companies to}} predict their <b>liabilities.</b> <b>Conventional</b> methods, such as ladder or separation methods based on aggregated or grouped claims of the so-called "run-off triangle", have been illustrated to have some drawbacks. Recently, individual claim loss models have attracted {{a great deal of}} interest in actuarial literature, which can overcome the shortcomings of aggregated claim loss models. In this paper, we propose an alternative individual claim loss model, which has a semiparametric structure and can be used to fit flexibly the claim loss reserving. Local likelihood is employed to estimate the parametric and nonparametric components of the model, and their asymptotic properties are discussed. Then the prediction of the IBNR claim loss reserving is investigated. A simulation study is carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods.

40|$|Conventional {{leaders and}} {{leadership}} of the past are insufficient {{to meet the demands}} of the 21 st Century. As we enter the new millennium, our world is characterised by unprecedented complexity, paradox, and unpredictability. Change is rapid and relentless. Today's leaders face demands unlike any ever before faced. Standard leadership approaches that have served us well throughout much of history are quickly becoming <b>liabilities.</b> <b>Conventional</b> wisdom regarding leadership and many of its habits must be unlearned. The strong, decisive, charismatic, and independent leader and leadership we have idealised, strived to be, depended upon, and longed for may prove counter-productive in the new millennium and undermine a sustainable future. The challenges and opportunities of the 21 st Century call for a new type of leader and leadership, indeed an entirely new and different way of thinking about leadership and of developing future leaders. This paper explores the nature of the nascent millennium and the leader and leadership qualities and capabilities expected to be crucial in the uncertain decades ahead. Eight general categories of leadership attributes have been identified as essential for the future. Those who possess or are developing these competence sets are Renaissance Leaders [...] individuals who are different and make a difference. A significant gap remains between current leadership competencies and those needed in the future. Implications of this gap are discussed. One important finding is that leadership development programs in industry and higher education have yet to refocus to produce the kind of leaders needed. Suggestions for reform are offered...|$|R
50|$|Automatism {{is arguably}} the only defence that {{excludes}} responsibility by negating {{the existence of the}} actus reus which uniquely allows it to be a defence to both <b>conventional</b> and strict <b>liability</b> offences (although this argument could be extended to the status defence of insanity too). Strict automatism is a denial of actus reus and therefore most commonly used as a defence against strict liability offences. There are a number of reasons why a person may go into a state of automatism, including dissociation or hypo/hyperglycemia. Unconsciousness is the defence of denial of mens rea, which is easier to prove and hence more commonly used for non-strict liability crimes. For example, in cases of homicidal sleepwalking the illegal act is typically not denied but the intent to kill is. The defendant will typically be perplexed and confused and will not cover up the episode. Kenneth Parks, after killing his mother-in-law and severely injuring his father-in-law, drove to the police station stating that he thought he'd killed some people. The person's movements seem purposeful - the sleepwalker interacts with his environment in a limited way. Nonetheless the sleepwalker is not conscious of his actions. The use of the term automatism for these situations causes some confusion, as in these cases it is really the lack of intent {{on the part of the}} defendant which denies the mens rea of the offence rather than the actus reus (although this distinction is problematic in many instances), better called unconsciousness. Intention is a problem in crimes of strict liability. Very few people intend to crash their vehicles, so clearly something better than intent is required to define automatism.|$|R
40|$|It was {{twenty-five years}} ago that Guido Calabresi and Douglas Melamed {{published}} their article on property rules, liability rules, and inalienability 2 ̆ 7 Calabresi, then a law professor, later a dean, is now a federal judge. Melamed, formerly a student of Calabresi 2 ̆ 7 s, is now a seasoned Washington attorney. Their article-which, thanks to its subtitle, we shall call The Cathedral-has had a remarkable influence on our own thinking, as we tried to show in a recent paper 2 This {{is not the place}} to rehash what we said then, but a summary might be in order. First, we demonstrated that the <b>conventional</b> wisdom about <b>liability</b> (damage) rules, that judges should use them when transaction costs are high, is incorrect, because the costs of assessing damages might in fact be higher still; if they are, property (injunction) rules are superior; at least from the standpoint of efficiency Second, and relatedly, we identified problems of correlation and synergy that come into play as one tries to choose between damages and injunctive relief. Correlation problems arise because the same considerations that yield high transaction costs usually yield high assessment costs as well; synergy problems arise because the use of damage rules can inhibit the development of more effective bargaining practices. Third, we showed that Calabresi and Melamed 2 ̆ 7 s celebrated Rule 4 (reverse damages) contains a paradox, which we went on to resolve by inventing reverse-reverse damages (the 2 ̆ 2 double reverse twist 2 ̆ 2). The trick of the double reverse twist relates to our fourth point, having to do with a 2 ̆ 2 best-chooser axiom 2 ̆ 2 which can be used to illuminate matters of institutional (not just judicial) design generally Finally, we suggested in conclusion the relationship of much of the foregoing to relevant literature in other disciplines...|$|R
