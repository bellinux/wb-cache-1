40|$|Anterior {{pituitary}} <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> of cows {{showed a}} cycle dependent sensitivity to GnRH. The smallest GnRH-inducable LH and FSH secretions were measured {{during the initial}} phase of the corpus luteum. During the blossom phase of the corpus luteum the GnRH-inducable LH and FSH secredons were greater. They increased further during the regression phase of the corpus luteum to reach maximal values in the proestrus stage. During the estrus the GnRH induced LH and FSH concentradons decreased again. The anterior pituitary <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> of pregnant cows were, with one exception, not sensitive to GnRH. The <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> of 5 out of 7 cows with ovarian cysts secreted only small quantities of LH and FSH following stimulation with GnRH, similarly to the anterior pituitary <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> of the cows in the initial phase of corpus luteum. From the remaining two cows with ovarian cysts the <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> of the one cow showed a marked LH and FSH secretion already at the smallest GnRH concentration, whereas the <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> of the second cow showed a strong LH-, but a minimal FSH secretion. The ratio LH: FSH also changed during the estrus cycle. It was smallest in <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> of anterior pituitaries obtained from cows of the corpus luteum regression phase and increased linearly. The greatest ratio LH: FSH was measured during the estrus phase of the cycle. Thereafter it declined again. In anterior pituitary <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> of cows with ovarian cysts the ratio LH:FSH was twice that found in anterior pituitary <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> of estrous cows...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cell death {{induced by}} intracellutar {{glutathione}} depletion {{has been reported}} to be dependent on the presence of trace amounts of extracellular copper ions. Since {{little is known about the}} relationship between glutathione depletion and copper homeostasis, we have in the present study further investigated the role of low amounts of copper ions in glutathione depletion. Methods: Glutathione turnover was investigated in HeLa and hepatoma <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> with normal and low cysteine content in the presence of copper ions (1 and 10 mu mol/L) and two other glutathione-stimulating agents (lipoic acid and mercury ions). Results: Copper ions (10 mu mol/L) caused relatively small increases in total amount of glutathione (the sum of the intracellular and the extracellular amount of glutathione) in HeLa and hepatoma <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> with normal cysteine levels (420 nmol/mL) compared to control <b>cell</b> <b>cultures,</b> whereas lipoic acid and mercury ions strongly increased total glutathione in both types of <b>cell</b> <b>cultures.</b> Lower amount of total glutathione was observed in <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> with a lower cysteine levels (84 nmol/mL), which is similar to that in human plasma. A strongly decreased total amount of glutathione in the presence of copper ions was observed in hepatoma <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> with lower cysteine levels, whereas the other agents showed effects similar to those described for <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> with normal cysteine levels. Conclusion: Glutathione synthesis in hepatoma <b>cell</b> <b>cultures</b> is probably more sensitive to a low cysteine level than HeLa <b>cell</b> <b>cultures,</b> and the presence of copper ions further decreases the availability of cysteine probably by increasing the disultide binding to cysteine residues in extracellular proteins, which causes a further decrease of total glutathione.

5|$|RNAi is a {{valuable}} research tool, both in <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> and in living organisms, because synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can selectively and robustly induce suppression of specific genes of interest. RNAi {{may be used for}} large-scale screens that systematically shut down each gene in the cell, which can help to identify the components necessary for a particular cellular process or an event such as cell division.

5|$|The biotechnological {{applications}} of toxin-antitoxin systems {{have begun to}} be realised by several biotechnology organisations. A primary usage is in maintaining plasmids in a large bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>culture.</b> In an experiment examining {{the effectiveness of the}} hok/sok locus, it was found that segregational stability of an inserted plasmid expressing beta-galactosidase was increased by between 8 and 22 times compared to a control culture lacking a toxin-antitoxin system. In large-scale microorganism processes such as fermentation, progeny cells lacking the plasmid insert often have a higher fitness than those who inherit the plasmid and can outcompete the desirable microorganisms. A toxin-antitoxin system maintains the plasmid thereby maintaining the efficiency of the industrial process.|$|E

5|$|While the {{long-term}} potentiation of synapses in <b>cell</b> <b>culture</b> seems {{to provide an}} elegant substrate for learning and memory, the contribution of LTP to behavioral learning — that is, learning {{at the level of}} the whole organism — cannot simply be extrapolated from in vitro studies.

Because of this, LTP also plays a crucial role in fear processing.|$|E

5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, extracts of I. badia fruit {{bodies have}} been shown to have significant antioxidative properties in vitro. Fruit bodies contain the compound theanine, an amino acid and a glutamic acid analogue found in green tea. Efforts have been made to establish a protocol for producing theanine by growing the fungus mycelium using submerged fermentation. Several indole compounds have been detected in fruit bodies. Unprocessed mushrooms contain tryptophan (0.68mg per 100g dry weight), tryptamine (0.47), serotonin (0.52), kynurenine sulphate (1.96), and kynurenic acid (1.57). Due to their temperature sensitivity, cooking significantly changes the contents and composition of indole compounds: cooked mushrooms contained tryptophan (1.74mg/100g dw), 5-methyltryptophan (6.55), melatonin (0.71), and indoleacetonitrile (2.07). Fruit body extracts {{have been shown}} to slow the growth of certain tumour cell lines in <b>cell</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E
