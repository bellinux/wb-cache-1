40|$|Abstract — Programmable {{multiprocessor}} systems-on-chip {{are becoming}} the preferred implementation platform for embedded streaming applications. This enables using more software components, {{which leads to}} large and frequent dynamic variations of data-dependent execution times. In this context, accurate and <b>conservative</b> <b>prediction</b> of execution times helps in maintaining good audio/video quality and reducing energy consumption by dynamic evaluation {{of the amount of}} on-chip resources needed by applications. To be effective, multiprocessor systems have to employ the available parallelism. The combination of task-level parallelism and task delay variations makes predicting execution times a very hard problem. So far, under these conditions, no appropriate techniques exist for the <b>conservative</b> <b>prediction</b> of execution times with the required accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel technique for this problem, exploiting the concept of scenario-based prediction, and taking into account the transient and periodic behavior of scenarios and the effect of scenario transitions. In our MPEG- 4 shape-decoder case study, we observe no more than 11 % average overestimation. I...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} the time {{dependent}} failure assessment diagram (TDFAD) approach {{is applied to}} the study of crack initiation in Type 316 H stainless steel, a material commonly used in high temperature applications. A TDFAD has been constructed for the steel at a temperature of 550 oC, and was found to be relatively insensitive to time. The TDFAD procedure is then applied to predict initiation times, at increments of creep crack growth Δa = 0. 2 mm and Δa = 0. 5 mm, for tests on compact tension specimens and the results compared to experimentally determined values. It has been found that initiation time predictions are sensitive to the creep toughness values, and to the limit load (or reference stress) solution used. <b>Conservative</b> <b>predictions</b> of initiation times have been achieved through the use of the lower bound creep toughness values in conjunction with the plane strain limit load solution.

The algorithm for 0 -CFA performs dynamic transitive closure of a graph that is based on the judgement associated with the proof-net.

In this study, one square hollow section and two rectangular hollow sections were tested at different column lengths. The material properties {{were obtained from}} tensile coupon tests and stub column tests. The test specimens were cold-rolled from flat strips of lean duplex stainless steel (EN 1. 4162). Initial overall geometric imperfections of the column specimens were measured prior to testing. The column specimens were concentrically loaded between pinned ends. The ultimate loads and the failure modes of each column are presented. The test strengths of the specimens were compared with the design strengths predicted by the American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and European Code for stainless steel structures. Generally, the specifications are able to predict {{the strengths of the}} tested columns. The European Code provides the most <b>conservative</b> <b>predictions,</b> while the American Specification provides <b>conservative</b> <b>predictions</b> when the design strengths calculated using the material properties from tensile coupon tests. The design approach of using full cross-section area and material properties obtained by stub column tests for all classes of sections including slender sections was recommended.

40|$|Abstract — Three-dimensional digital terrain {{models are}} of {{fundamental}} importance {{in many areas}} such as the geo-sciences and outdoor robotics. Accurate modeling requires the ability to deal with a varying data density and to balance smoothing against the preservation of discontinuities. The latter is particularly important for robotics applications, as discontinuities that arise, for example, at steps, stairs, or building walls are important features for path planning or terrain segmentation tasks. In this paper, we present an extension of the well-established Gaussian process regression approach that utilizes non-stationary covariance functions to locally adapt to the structure of the terrain data. In this way, we achieve strong smoothing in flat areas and along edges {{and at the same time}} preserve edges and corners. The derived model yields predictive distributions for terrain elevations at arbitrary locations and thus allows to fill gaps in the data and to perform <b>conservative</b> <b>predictions</b> in occluded areas.

Once released, the resilience of the tow rope allows the rope and handle to spring toward the motorboat with the potential for overtaking the craft and impacting its crew. This paper examines this safety problem; specifically, it analyzes the wakeboard which subsumes water skiing, slaloming, kneeboarding and barefooting. A first order formulation is developed for describing the tow handle trajectory in terms of the system geometry, the skier’s grip strength and the mechanical properties of the tow rope. A rope stiffness criterion is established that guarantees the released tow handle will fall harmlessly into the water as opposed to striking the motorboat. The handle flight time and maximum impact speed are predicted for a worst case scenario. Further, the formulation provides a guideline for refining its <b>conservative</b> <b>predictions</b> by testing rope candidates...|$|R
