Curious to remark, while Friedrich {{is writing}} this Letter, [...] "THURSDAY, DECEMBER 16th, 1773," [...] what a commotion is going on, far over seas, at Boston, New England,--in the [...] "Old South Meeting-house" [...] there; {{in regard to}} three English Tea Ships that are lying embargoed in Griffin's Wharf for above a {{fortnight}} past. The case is well known, and still memorable to mankind. British Parliament, after nine years of the saddest haggling and baffling to and fro, under <b>Constitutional</b> <b>stress</b> of weather, and such east-winds and west-winds of Parliamentary eloquence as seldom were, has made up its mind, That America shall pay duty on these Teas before infusing them: and America, Boston more especially, is tacitly determined that it will not; and that, to avoid mistakes, these Teas shall never be landed at all. Such is Boston's private intention, more or less fixed;--to {{say nothing of the}} Philadelphias, Charlestons, New Yorks, who are watching Boston, and will follow suit of it.|$|E
40|$|This article {{argues for}} the {{importance}} of attending to the unwritten elements of constitutionalism for both constitutional theory and constitutional design. In particular, the concern is with the structural elements of constitutions - the way in which power is distributed and institutions are structured in constitutions - not on the interpretation or substance of constitutional rights. The article looks carefully at the two North American constitutional orders that emerged out of or in reaction to the unwritten tradition of the UK, analyzing contemporary jurisprudential debates in Canada and excavating a somewhat more buried but no less robust tradition of thinking about the unwritten constitution in the US. Close examination of the practices and theory of constitutionalism in both countries suggests that it is the unwritten constitutional conventions, norms, and ethos that ultimately prove essential to sustaining a stable democracy governed by the rule of law. Furthermore, looking at moments of constitutional tension in both countries - debates about Quebec 2 ̆ 7 s place in Canada and times of war and terror, both historical and modern, in the US - indicates that these unwritten elements of the constitutional order become particularly important at times of extremity, <b>constitutional</b> <b>stress,</b> and national crisis. The article closes with reflections on how taking unwritten constitutionalism seriously might inflect contemporary constitutional theory and what it might mean for projects of constitutional design...|$|E

Foram analisados 84 pacientes, de ambros os sexos, com idade média de 55 anos. Foram {{realizadas}}, pela equipe de psicólogos, duas entrevistas semidirigidas, durante cada uma das quais foram aplicados o Inventário de Ansiedade Traço - Estado (IDATE) e a Escala de Hamilton.

Os resultados permitiram-nos concluir que a grande maioria apresentou padrão comportamental tipo A, próprio do coronariano, alto estresse constitucional e ambiental e ansiedade - traço acima da média.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses {{whether and}} to what extent constitutions, and their constitutional law more generally, make provision for secession. More broadly put, the question is what place secession has, or should have under municipal constitutional law. The two aspects of the question naturally are different in focus and intent. Whether secession has a place under any constitutional system depends very much on the text of any given constitutional document and the current body of constitutional law and norms. It is principally a factual enquiry, a matter for descriptive jurisprudence. Whether secession should figure in some way in a constitution or the constitutional law and norms is more speculative an enquiry, bordering on politics, legal theory, constitutional theory, and like matters, and pertains more to analytic jurisprudence. The two are nonetheless conjoined inasmuch as the subsuming of secession under a constitutional system in the absence of express provisions therefor depends in a large measure on what analytic stance we take on constitutional and legal theory, and on what a constitution, generally and in particular, should address. Now obviously, the two sides of this single issues are related, insofar as the first draws upon norms and principles to inform – implicitly – constitutional and relevant law, and the second upon the constitution and law as practical framework or instantiation of the norms and principles. This suggests that in constitutional theory, secession should be conceived less as purely some institutional re-arranging inside or outside the current institutional and regulatory framework. Similarly, a constitution should be conceived less as purely a template or map of state, and more as institutional architecture, namely the building of institutions to strengthen and develop the moral foundations of a society. We take the position in this thesis that secession is indeed a matter appropriate for constitutional law, and is governed thereby. Whilst secession provisions are not and should not be incorporated expressly into a constitution the process of secession is certainly subject to constitutional law and norms. Some inroad to a full grasp of this position (but not its implications) has already been forged by the Supreme Court of Canada, in the Québec Secession Reference. As such, and to the extent outlined below, secession, as an element of constitutional law, engages the courts at least on that basis, insofar as their jurisdiction permits. Accordingly, secession is more than a purely political (TABLE OF CONTENTS Volume 1 Foreword	 i Table of Contents 	 ii Samenvatting	 vii Chapter 1 THE JUSTICIABILITY OF SECESSION? 1.

A crucial element in the controversy around his third term was the legality of his candidacy.

Second, a peace agreement {{was referred to as}} a source of legitimacy and as a legal norm. Third, a Constitutional Court ruling was invoked to address the legal loophole.

During the Civil War and Reconstruction this professional ideal came to grief as legal discourse degenerated into a war of ideas over the constitutional contradictions opened by secession, unprecedented assertions of executive branch war powers, and often violent southern resistance to Reconstruction after Appomattox.

According to {{the latest}} {{statistics}} {{it has been estimated}} that 72 % of South African children, or 4, 6 million aged 0 - 6, and 12, 3 million aged 0 - 18 are poor. These children face shortages of food, clothing, and shelter. They also lack access to basic services. It can therefore be argued with authority that basic human dignity and other fundamental rights are denied to these children. In order to facilitate South Africa's development as a democratic state based on human dignity, freedom, and equality, the government has recently confirmed its commitment to eradicate child poverty in particular. The concept of socio-economic rights, more specifically the right of access to adequate housing was introduced through section 26 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. This right entitles everyone, including children to access to adequate housing. In terms of section 26 (2) the state must take reasonable legislative and other measures to progressively realise the right. However, as confirmed by the Constitutional Court in The Government of the Republic of South Africa and Others v Grootboom and Others 2000 11 BCLR 1169 (CC), the right of access to adequate housing is subject to the availability of state resources. Section 28 (l) (c) of the Constitution expressly conferres upon children an additional right to basic shelter over and above their right in terms of section 26. In this respect it must be remembered that a child's right to basic shelter is subject to the same internal limitations as the other socio-economic rights in the Bill of Rights. The aim of this study was to analyse the possible utilisation of these rights in order to alleviate poverty, while keeping in mind that the <b>Constitutional</b> Court <b>stressed</b> that the realisation of socio-economic rights is key to the advancement of South Africa as a democratic state. This dissertation mainly focussed on children's socio-economic right to basic shelter in conjunction with everyone's right of access to adequate housing. Therefore, when discussing the legislative and other measures taken to implement these rights as a reaction to poverty, focus was mainly on those measures relevant to the housing problem. Further emphasis was also placed on the findings and recommendations made concerning the realisation of housing rights in South Africa by institutions such as the South African Human Rights Commission. In response to the research and findings presented in this dissertation, the following recommendations are made: The South African Human Rights Commission emphasised that the measures implemented to realise socio-economic rights such as the right of access to adequate housing must be done in an integrated and co-operative manner involving all three spheres of government. This lies at the heart of any successful reaction to poverty, thus it can only be stressed that the principles of co-operative government should be included in any measure implemented. Another problem facing the successful implementation of measures to realise socio-economic rights is the prevailing incompetence of department officials. It is recommended that government officials receive the necessary training in resource management and development planning. This would result in more effective development plans to implement measures to realise socio-economic right. Government especially at local level is riddled with corruption and resource miss-management. This problem must be remedied on a permanent basis as soon as possible. It was found that the measures taken to alleviate the housing crisis in South Africa focused mainly on the realisation of section 26, while realising children's right to basic shelter on an indirect basis only. In light of government's commitment to implement the principles of the UNCRC it is submitted that measures should be taken on a progressive basis that cater for the direct realisation of section 28 (l) (c). Measures, which is currently taken to realise children's right to basic shelter, was found to be inadequate. This situation should be remedied by amending the relevant legislation and enacting more legislation, policies, and programmes specifically aimed at the children's housing interests. Master...|$|R
