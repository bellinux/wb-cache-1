Such nurses are required by their employers to seek additional certifications beyond basic nursing licensure and are often required to have three years (minimum) of full-time experience in emergency and/or intensive care. Certifications requirements vary but often include advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), basic life support (BLS), pediatric advanced life support (PALS), neonatal resuscitation program (NRP), trauma nursing core course (TNCC), and Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), in addition to Pre-Hospital Trauma Life Support (PHTLS). Standards also include being board certified in Emergency Nursing (CEN), Critical <b>Care</b> <b>Nursing</b> (CCRN), and Ground Transport (CTRN) or Flight Nursing (CFRN) respectively. These nurses are trained up to and able to operate {{at or above the}} level of a paramedic and in some regions are authorized to operate base station phones for medical command. Some states allow them to operate entirely under standing orders while on a ground ambulance or air medical unit (i.e. offline medical control). Training also includes specific education relevant to the state and its protocols, and often require the nurse to train with paramedics {{for a period of time}} as well as taking an additional exam administered by their medical director before being allowed to operate on a ground ambulance or air medical unit. Many of these nurses hold certifications as Emergency Medical Technicians or Paramedics, and in some states are required to, but it is not the standard of practice.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Women who are {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer require the support of a range of people during their treatment. Although the role of the breast <b>care</b> <b>nurse</b> in providing support has recently been investigated in several Australian studies the patients' perspective {{on the role of the}} breast <b>care</b> <b>nurse</b> in Australian hospitals has not previously been described in detail. The aim of this paper is to explore patients' perspectives on the role of the breast <b>care</b> <b>nurse.</b> METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 18 women who had completed treatment for early breast cancer. The women were asked to describe their experiences from the time of diagnosis through to treatment completion. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. FINDINGS: Breast cancerv patients repeatedly emphasised the importance eif the role eif their breast <b>care</b> <b>nurses</b> throughout their experience of breast cancer. The support that breast <b>care</b> <b>nurses</b> provided incorporated the following components: communication, rapport and an awareness of the women's needs, availability, reassurance and practical information.

The question arises for nurses: are there adequate support systems in the critical care environment and what are critical <b>care</b> <b>nurses</b> doing to mantain their own health and well-being. Facilitating conscious awareness among critical <b>care</b> <b>nurses</b> could enhance their resiliency and their hardiness, strengthening their coping capacities in stressful working situations. The contextual framework adopted for this research was the Neuman Systems Model. A qualitative research approach (exploratory, descriptive and contextual) was used to explore and describe the stress experienced by critical <b>care</b> <b>nurses.</b> Focus group {{interviews were conducted with}} critical <b>care</b> <b>nurses</b> and individual interviews with nurse managers. The results revealed their perceptions and experiences about the effects of stress in the critical care environment, {{as well as some of}} their coping strategies. Raising critical care nurses' levels of conscious awareness about their coping strategies with stressful events in their daily working lives, could enhance their resiliency and hardiness, enabling them to continue working effectively in stressful environments.

60|$|Let us {{examine this}} very curious theory. First: Mr. Morgan supposes early {{man to have}} made a {{discovery}} (the evils of the marriage of near kin) which evades modern physiological science. Modern science has not determined that the marriages of kinsfolk are pernicious. Is it credible that savages should discover a fact which puzzles science? It may be replied that modern <b>care,</b> <b>nursing,</b> and medical art save children of near marriages from results which were pernicious to the children of early man. Secondly: Mr. Morgan supposes that barbarous man (so notoriously reckless of the morrow as he is), not only made the discovery of the evils of interbreeding, but acted on it with promptitude and self-denial. Thirdly: Mr. Morgan seems to require, for the enforcement of the exogamous law, a contrat social. The larger communities meet, and divide themselves into smaller groups, within which wedlock is forbidden. This 'social pact' is like a return to the ideas of Rousseau. Fourthly: The hypothesis credits early men with knowledge and discrimination of near degrees of kin, which they might well possess if they lived in patriarchal families. But it represents that they did not act on their knowledge. Instead of prohibiting marriage between parents and children, cousins, nephews and aunts, uncles and nieces, they prohibited marriage within the limit of the name of the kin. This is still the Hindoo rule, and, if the Romans really might not at one time marry within the gens, it was the Roman rule. Now observe, this rule fails to effect the very purpose for which ex hypothesi it was instituted. Where the family name goes by the male side, marriages between cousins are permitted, as in India and China. These are the very marriages which some theorists now denounce as pernicious. But, if the family name goes by the female side, marriages between half-brothers and half-sisters are permitted, as in ancient Athens and among the Hebrews of Abraham's time. Once more, the exogamous prohibition excludes, in China, America, Africa, Australia, persons who are in no way akin (according to our ideas) from intermarriage. Thus Mr. Doolittle writes: {256} 'Males and females of the same surname will never intermarry in China. Cousins who have not the same ancestral surname may intermarry. Though the ancestors of persons of the same surname have not known each other for thousands of years, they may not intermarry.' The Hindoo gotra rule produces the same effects.|$|E

The IABP is an effective and general used circulatory support device. The nursing of a patient on IABP therapy requires demonstration of specific clinical competence by the critical <b>care</b> <b>nurse.</b> Clinical competence is defined as the ability of the critical <b>care</b> <b>nurse</b> to integrate his/her knowledge, skills and values and to demonstrate it during nursing of a patient on IABP with the aim to promote the patient's health. The aim of this research had been to evaluate the clinical competence of the critical <b>care</b> <b>nurse</b> during the nursing of a patient on IABP, and to make recommendations according to that regarding education, the practice and research. The relationship between the components of clinical competence namely knowledge, skills and values that were set as aim, were also established.

40|$|Summary: This study {{describes}} {{the role of}} acute hospital palliative <b>care</b> <b>nurse</b> consultants and makes recommendations about future directions for the role development of this role. While the palliative <b>care</b> <b>nurse</b> consultant role is accepted in the acute setting {{there is little evidence}} or literature about what contributes to the success of this role. A three-phase study was undertaken to describe the role of palliative <b>care</b> <b>nurse</b> consultants in acute hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. The first phase of the three-phase study, involving in-depth qualitative interviews with the palliative <b>care</b> <b>nurse</b> consultants, is reported in this article. Using openended semi-structured questions, 10 palliative <b>care</b> <b>nurse</b> consultants were interviewed using open-ended questions about aspects of their role and the interviews were thematically analysed. Four main themes were identified that clarified the role; being the internal link; being the lynch pin; being responsive and being challenged. The palliative <b>care</b> <b>nurse</b> consultants were the first point of introduction to palliative care and thus they saw a significant role in introducing the concept of palliative care to those requiring palliative care, their families and others. They are an important link between the settings of care required by people accessing palliative care—–acute, in-patient palliative care and community care. The palliative <b>care</b> <b>nurse</b> consultants saw themselves in leadership positions that in some ways defy boundaries, because of the inherent complexity and diversity of the role.
