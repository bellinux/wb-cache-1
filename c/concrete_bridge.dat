5|$|After {{the failure}} of the 26th Corps at Hagaru-ri, the PVA High Command ordered the 26th and the 27th Corps to chase the {{escaping}} UN force with the 20th Corps blocking the escape route. But with most of the 20th Corps destroyed at Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the only forces between Koto-ri and Hungnam were the remnants of the 58th and the 60th Divisions. In desperation, Song Shi-Lun ordered these troops to dig in at Funchilin Pass while blowing up the vital treadway bridge, hoping the terrain and obstacles would allow the 26th and the 27th Corps {{to catch up with the}} retreating UN forces. The PVA 180th Regiment that occupied Hill 1081 blew up the original <b>concrete</b> <b>bridge</b> and two improvised replacements in succession, believing the bridge was rendered irreparable. In response, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines (1/1) attacked Hill 1081 from the south, and the hill was captured on 9 December after the defenders fought to the last man. At the same time, the 7th Marines and RCT-31 attacked the treadway bridge from the north, only to encounter defenders that were already frozen in their foxholes.|$|E
5|$|For {{transportation}} on the bay, steamboats were commonplace between Corpus Christi and Ingleside {{during the}} 1930s. Native Americans used a route {{made up of}} a series of shallow oyster beds, dubbed Reef Road. The passage, which was about 18 to 24inches in depth, could be navigated on foot or horseback during low tides to travel across the opening of Nueces Bay into Corpus Christi Bay. White settlers discovered the road in the 1860s, and it became a common way to pass from Portland to Corpus Christi via buggy, although its jagged course had to be marked with posts and horses would sometimes fall off the beds and drown. A wooden causeway connecting Portland and Corpus Christi was first constructed in 1915, but was repeatedly rebuilt and destroyed by several storms. A permanent <b>concrete</b> <b>bridge</b> was erected in the 1950s, and a double lane was added in 1988. The approximately mile long structure is today known as the Nueces Bay Causeway.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, the New York State Legislature {{passed a}} law authorizing the {{construction}} of a highway connecting Route24 (an unsigned legislative route that is now part of NY30) to the new Veterans' Mountain Camp, an American Legion camp on Tupper Lake. The work was funded through appropriations defined in the law. The beginning of a state road to the camp came in 1924 when earth movers were brought in by the Harnathy Contracting Company, with construction beginning in early June. The project would include construction of a <b>concrete</b> <b>bridge</b> over the Bog River. However, Hanrathy was unable to finish the job as it went bankrupt, and a second firm, the Spadaccini Realty Construction Corporation of The Bronx was brought into finish the job, which began in June1925.The bridge over the Bog River was completed on August 29, 1925 and they announced would be opened for traffic within ten days.The route did finally open in 1925, with the Veterans Camp opening on May 15, 1926. This road was extended from modern NY30 north to a dead end at Warren Point. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, hundreds of state-maintained highways that did not yet have a designation were assigned one. The Veterans' Mountain Camp highway was designated as NY421 by the following year.|$|E

25|$|The Dragon Bridge, {{although}} significantly modelled {{after the}} Nußdorf weir, is often {{regarded as the}} most beautiful bridge produced by the Vienna Secession. It is the first bridge in Slovenia paved with asphalt, the first reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>bridge</b> in Ljubljana, and one of Europe's earliest reinforced concrete bridges. When opened in 1901, it had the third largest arch in Europe at that time. The bridge is built to the Melan System invented by Josef Melan, which gained popularity particularly in the United States and Germany because the bridges could be built without a supporting stage. Rigid truss arches made of iron are set into the reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>bridge.</b> The load-bearing core of the bridge was the truss iron framework during construction.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the past}} ten years, {{considerable}} increases in traffic volume and vehicle loads have caused obviously fatigue damage in existing highway reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>bridges</b> in China. Some highway reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>bridges</b> were damaged seriously, leading to the whole bridge collapse sometimes because of overloading and oversize trucks. In order to observe the highway load character in Shaanxi province, truck weigh device is set up in highway pavement to measure axle weights and axle spacing. Based on these data, it can be classified and generalized the different classes of vehicles, and drawn out the simplifying fatigue truck model in Shaanxi province. Furthermore, the fatigue truck model {{was used to evaluate}} the fatigue life and service safety of typical <b>concrete</b> <b>bridges...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of highway bridges started to increase {{dramatically in the}} 1960 s in Japan and so maintenance costs will accelerate after 2010, thus new structures are required to be more durable. There are, however, many <b>concrete</b> <b>bridges</b> suffering corrosion in coastal areas. Some bridges have already been dismantled due to heavy corrosion when only 20 to 30 years old, in some cases maintenance cost exceeded construction cost, and many corroded bridges {{will need to be}} replaced in several years. Therefore, we have been studying durability improvement by using high-strength concrete or high-performance concrete (HSC/HPC) as well as new durability designs for <b>concrete</b> <b>bridges</b> in harsh environments. This paper reviews the corrosion problems and the durability design method of <b>concrete</b> <b>bridges,</b> and shows the effectiveness of HSC/HPC. ...|$|R
25|$|The use of {{de-icing}} salts on roadways, used {{to lower the}} freezing point of water, {{is probably one of}} the primary causes of premature failure of reinforced or prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>bridge</b> decks, roadways, and parking garages. The use of epoxy-coated reinforcing bars and the application of cathodic protection has mitigated this problem to some extent. Also FRP (fiber-reinforced polymer) rebars are known to be less susceptible to chlorides. Properly designed concrete mixtures that have been allowed to cure properly are effectively impervious to the effects of de-icers.|$|E

This was due largely to the high compressive strength of <b>concrete.</b> Other new <b>bridge</b> construction methods that were developed at the time include the span-by-span method, the progressive placement method, and the incremental launching method. All of these methods were developed around the same time period because of the advancements in computer software design.|$|R
