They {{stop at a}} rundown motel, where Stewie tries calling home, but fails because he believes his phone number is 867-5309.

In each {{subsequent}} round one fewer <b>card</b> <b>is</b> dealt, until by the tenth and final round, each player receives only one <b>card.</b> <b>Cards</b> <b>are</b> dealt clockwise. The pile of remaining <b>cards</b> <b>is</b> placed face-down {{in the middle}} of the table, and its top <b>card</b> <b>is</b> turned over. The color of this <b>card</b> <b>is</b> the trump suit; a card of this color played to a trick will beat any other card played except a higher trump. If this top <b>card</b> <b>is</b> a Rage <b>card,</b> it <b>is</b> discarded and another <b>card</b> <b>is</b> turned over, until a color <b>card</b> <b>is</b> shown.|$|R

5|$|In 1976, three {{collectors}} {{discovered a}} T206 Wagner that featured Wagner {{in a different}} pose, never seen {{in any of the}} other cards. Although a Library of Congress expert said the paper on the card dated back to 1910, the three men decided to submit the card for a water test, using chemicals to determine the card's authenticity. The card broke apart, and as a result, the <b>card</b> <b>was</b> dismissed as a fake.|$|E

The magnetic stripe on a <b>card</b> <b>is</b> typically read as the <b>card</b> <b>is</b> extracted. If the <b>card</b> <b>is</b> a smart <b>card,</b> then the data transfer typically takes place when the <b>card</b> <b>is</b> fully inserted. In this case, the <b>card</b> <b>is</b> held while data transfer is taking place.|$|R
50|$|After the <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> dealt, {{the next}} <b>card</b> <b>is</b> put face up; the suit of this <b>card</b> <b>is</b> the trump suit. In the games with 8 <b>cards</b> there <b>is</b> no <b>card</b> left to turn, and these games are played with no trump.|$|R

On February 24 of the following year, the 122nd anniversary of Wagner's birthday, the grand prize drawing for the <b>card</b> <b>was</b> held on CNN's Larry King Weekend. At around 9:00 P.M., Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson, one of King's guests on the show, pulled out {{the name of one}} Patricia Gibbs, a postal worker living in Hollywood, Florida. After spending hours unsuccessfully trying to contact Gibbs, King's staff finally got through to her phone, and informed Gibbs of her prize. Treat Entertainment and Wal-Mart gave the card to Gibbs a few weeks later at a Wal-Mart store in Miramar, Florida. Gibbs could not afford the taxes on the card, so she decided to consign the card to an auction later on. She consigned the card to Christie's, a New York-based auction house better known for selling famous artworks.|$|E

These insert <b>cards</b> <b>are</b> {{not part of}} the regular numbering system of a set of sports cards and they tend to have a unique design.

This system allows for up to 4 card issuers in the market.

5|$|A {{weekend edition}} titled Super Sloppy Double Dare began taping in July 1987 and premiered August 2, 1987, {{with an initial}} 26-episode run. Super Sloppy Double Dare {{featured}} gameplay {{identical to the original}} format; however, physical challenges and obstacles were designed to make a bigger mess. Viewers were encouraged to send in a postcard with their contact information and could win a prize if their <b>card</b> <b>was</b> selected, and a team performing a physical challenge completed the stunt successfully. Episodes of Super Sloppy Double Dare were taped at Unitel Studio in New York City before production moved back to WHYY-TV.|$|E

Kane chokeslamed Henry {{towards the end}} of the contest and {{attempted}} to pin Henry. Chavo Guerrero and Kenny Dykstra interfered, however, and attacked Kane. Kane fought back and chokeslammed Dykstra, but Henry locked Kane in a bear hug. The referee stopped the contest after Kane kayfabe passed out.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{commented that}} the imaginative {{character}} designs and use of advanced graphics technology, such as hardware transform and lighting, and bump mapping, made the graphics of the game unrivaled in its time; ActionTrip was so impressed by the game's visuals that they thought their graphics <b>card</b> <b>was</b> supporting the complex hardware environmental bump mapping it was incapable of. The animation of Kabuto's antics such as elbow dropping onto tiny enemies, and tossing up and catching food with his mouth, in particular, won the praises of reviewers. Many critics, however, were disappointed that the computer versions of the game could not run smoothly at full details on the recommended system specifications.|$|E

5|$|The crime gained {{national}} notoriety for the particularly brutal way {{in which}} Pryce was murdered, only metres from his own home, and had only his Oyster card and mobile phone taken from him, but no money (the case being widely reported {{as an example of}} steaming).
