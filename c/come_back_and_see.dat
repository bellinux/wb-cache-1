[...] "I can honestly say, after Afghanistan, I'll never take anything in my life for granted again." [...] Kemp stated he was most proud of this series, more so than any of his previous work Kemp expressed hope that after the series people would appreciate the soldiers a bit better and see the bravery of the soldiers coping in hard conditions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{incident}} thrust Goshen College {{into the}} national limelight that June when several reports on Fox News publicized {{the fact that the}} college refused to play the national anthem, [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner," [...] at its athletic events. [...] Two Goshen city councilmen publicly criticized the college, with one referring to the decision as [...] "anti-American" [...] and stating that [...] "instead of living here in Goshen, they should go down and live in Cuba or Iran, then have them <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> if their attitude has changed." [...] The college, loosely affiliated with Mennonite Church USA, which is traditionally a peace church, published an online fact sheet stating that [...] "historically, playing the national anthem has not been among Goshen College's practices because of our Christ-centered core value of compassionate peacemaking seeming to be in conflict with the anthem’s militaristic language." ...|$|E

When the boy's mother finds this out, she throws the kitten out of the house. The kitten returnes, when the boy's mother is away. The little boy rejoys, and his mother only smiles when she <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> them together again...|$|R
50|$|Later, Tracey {{comes to}} the house and goes off with Sarah. Milay's ex-husband, Gerald shows up, giving his sympathy and {{planning}} to come to the funeral. Milay is outraged, mainly because Gerald didn't have the decency to come to their own son's funeral. Once Gerald leaves, Tracey then <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> Will, stating that he is her baby's father. The revelation startles everyone, especially Kim, who storms out in tears.|$|R
6000|$|We both turned round. There was the {{everlasting}} Mr. Begbie, {{too eager}} for the controversy to wait any longer at the gate. The Sergeant wrung my hand, and darted out into the court-yard, hotter still on his side. [...] "Ask him about the moss rose, when he <b>comes</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> if I have left him a leg to stand on!" [...] cried the great Cuff, hailing me through the window in his turn. [...] "Gentlemen, both!" [...] I answered, moderating them again as I had moderated them once already.|$|R

6000|$|... "Very well, darling. That's all right. Stay {{as long as}} you like. Don't {{trouble to}} get up if you'd rather have your breakfast in bed. And don't hurry {{yourself}} at all. I'll <b>come</b> <b>back</b> by-and-by <b>and</b> <b>see</b> what's the matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|This odd {{arrangement}} made Mrs. March smile, but {{she said}} gravely, [...] "Jo, I confide in you and don't wish you {{to say anything to}} Meg yet. When John <b>comes</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> I <b>see</b> them together, I can judge better of her feelings toward him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! so {{here you}} are, Catherine! Did {{you really think}} I {{was going to leave}} you in peace?' And as she spoke she walked to the linen press where Catherine's {{mistress}} kept all her finest sheets and underclothes, tore everything in pieces, and flung them on the floor. Poor Catherine wrung her hands and wept, for she thought to herself, 'When my lady <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> all this ruin she will think it is my fault,' and starting up, she fled through the open door. Then Destiny took all the pieces and made them whole again, <b>and</b> put them <b>back</b> in the press, and when everything was tidy she too left the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} away a long time, Alison. It must {{interest}} you to <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> {{the changes in}} our Western civilization. We are moving very rapidly--in certain directions," [...] he corrected himself.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the other}} boys and Garofoli return, Rémi {{witnesses}} how terribly Garofoli abuses {{those who do not}} bring home the amount of money required: he beats and starves them. When Vitalis <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> how the boys are being flogged, he tells Garofoli that he could go to the police, but Garofoli threatens back to tell [...] "some people just one name which will make Vitalis red from shame". Vitalis takes the wondering and grateful Rémi away. This act of love costs Vitalis his life. That night, unable {{to find a place to}} stay, Vitalis and Rémi collapse in the snowstorm under a fence after fruitlessly searching access to a stone quarry shelter.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I {{show that}} I want {{anything}} now, I'm lost,' {{he said to}} himself. 'All I need I'll take later on.' Then, aloud, 'It's hardly worth while; and I'm going to {{the country for a}} month, too. Wait till I <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> I'll <b>see</b> about it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't a {{question}} of that," [...] said Mrs. Bowen. [...] "It's {{a question}} of--others.

6000|$|... "Working near Ava," [...] he said; [...] "but as I {{should have}} to go to war if I had {{remained}} there, I thought that I would <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> how you all were.

I wouldn't believe it of him, not though his own mother said it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come now, Mistress Deborah, be good-humoured," [...] said Julian; [...] "consider, was not {{all this}} {{intimacy}} of ours of your own making? Did you not make yourself known to me {{the very first time}} I strolled up this glen with my fishing-rod, and tell me that you were my former keeper, and that Alice had been my little playfellow?

500|$|Edna asks [...] "Woodrow" [...] for a photograph, so Bart {{searches}} {{through a}} book called NHL Stars of 1969 and sends her a picture of ice hockey star Gordie Howe. Bart, as Woodrow, writes Edna other letters, using dialogue from old romance films {{to tell her what}} she wants to hear. He then sends a letter asking for them to meet at the Gilded Truffle restaurant. Bart sees Edna waiting for Woodrow, and laughs as he goes to watch a movie. When he <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> Edna still at the restaurant on the verge of tears, Bart is upset <b>and</b> guilty to <b>see</b> her crying. Meanwhile, Homer resists temptations to curse but nevertheless experiences intense feelings of rage. However, his constant swearing eventually puts enough money in the jar to purchase a dog house.|$|R

60|$|Romola, suspecting {{that if she}} {{followed}} {{the direction of the}} youth's flight, she should find some men and women who were still healthy and able, determined to seek them out at once, that she might at least win them {{to take care of the}} child, and leave her free to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> how many living needed help, and how many dead needed burial. She trusted to her powers of persuasion to conquer the aid of the timorous, when once she knew what was to be done.|$|E
6000|$|It is a queer {{life that}} they lead, these {{men of the}} coal-fields, and a [...] "big" [...] life to boot. To {{describe}} one-half of their labours would need {{a week at the}} least, and would be incomplete then. [...] "If you want to see anything," [...] they say, [...] "you should go over to the Baragunda copper-mines; you should look at the Barakar ironworks; you should see our boring operations five miles away; you should see how we sink pits; you should, above all, see Giridih Bazaar on a Sunday. Why, you haven't seen anything. There's no end of a Sonthal Mission hereabouts. All the little dev--dears have gone on a picnic.

50|$|The {{magistrate}} undresses {{and hangs}} his clothes {{on a tree}} and goes {{to sleep in the}} miller's bed. The miller has escaped from prison <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> the magistrate in his bed. The miller thinks that the magistrate is sleeping with his wife and plans to switch clothes with the magistrate and avenge himself by seducing the magistrate's wife. The miller leaves, dressed as the magistrate, and the magistrate soon wakes up. He goes outside <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> that his clothes are gone, so he dresses in the miller's clothes. The bodyguard comes <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> the magistrate dressed as the miller and goes to arrest him. The miller's wife sees the bodyguard fighting with what looks like her husband and joins in the fight. The miller <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> his wife in the fight and joins it to protect her. The magistrate explains the entire story and the ballet ends with the miller's guests tossing the magistrate up and down in a blanket.|$|R
5|$|In {{the last}} arc, Air, Yukito's final wish to save Misuzu's life is heard. The {{timeline}} of the Dream arc has been reset, {{although it is}} now seen through the viewpoint of a crow Misuzu finds and names Sora. New things are revealed that were not seen following Yukito in the Dream arc. After Misuzu finds Sora <b>and</b> brings him <b>back</b> home, her condition worsens and eventually she forgets even who Haruko is. Misuzu's father, Keisuke Tachibana, shows up during this arc wanting to take Misuzu back to his home, but Haruko pleads with him to grant her more time, and they agree on extending the time for three more days. After the three days pass, Keisuke <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> the love between Misuzu and Haruko; he decides to let them stay together. The remainder of this arc has Misuzu and Haruko spending time together like mother and daughter, culminating in Misuzu's death.|$|R
60|$|I {{have altered}} this place very much {{since you were}} here, and have made a pretty (I think an unusually pretty) drawing-room.

Whenever I feel that I have worked too much, or am {{on the eve of}} overdoing it, and want a change, away I go by the mail-train, and turn up in Paris or anywhere else that suits my humour, next morning. So I come back as fresh as a daisy, and preserve as ruddy a face as though I never leant over a sheet of paper. When I retire from a literary life I think of setting up as a Channel pilot.|$|E

6000|$|In {{two minutes}} an arm-chair full of magazines, slips of copy, and books for review, was emptied over the {{neighbouring}} coal-scuttle, and Clive {{was in the}} seat, a cigar in his mouth, as comfortable {{as if he had}} never been away. When did he come? Last night. He was back in Charlotte Street, at his old lodgings: he had been to breakfast in Fitzroy Square that morning; James Binnie chirped for joy at seeing him. His father had written to him desiring him to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> James Binnie; pretty Miss Rosey was very well, thank you: and Mrs. Mack?

5000|$|Thirteen and Taub check where Teddy lived {{before he}} moved into his fiancee's room, but the owner <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>sees</b> them. The owner, Cotter, claims to be Teddy's ex-boyfriend of three years. The team tests Teddy for HIV/AIDS but he's negative. Thirteen talks to him and finds out he had [...] "treatment" [...] to become heterosexual. He had electro {{convulsion}} therapy and was injected with many different chemicals. The chemicals could explain the pleural effusion and the ECT could explain the rest. The team thinks the ECT could have caused head trauma. During the EKG, Teddy has a heart attack. Foreman decides to do an angiogram to see if it's blocks or bleeds. The team comes in to prep Teddy for his angio, but every time he sits up he faints, and he stabilizes when he lies down. House thinks it could be postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), causing his blood pressure to plummet when he's upright.|$|R
