5|$|San Martín {{resigned}} from the Spanish army, for controversial reasons, and moved to South America, where he joined the Spanish American wars of independence. Historians propose several explanations for this action: the common ones are that he missed his native country, {{that he was a}} British agent and the <b>congruence</b> of the goals of both wars. The first explanation suggests that when the wars of independence began San Martín thought that his duty was to return to his country and serve in the military conflict. The second explanation suggests that Britain, which would benefit from the independence of the South American countries, sent San Martín to achieve it. The third suggests that both wars were caused by the conflicts between Enlightenment ideas and absolutism, so San Martín still waged the same war; the wars in the Americas only developed separatist goals after the Spanish Absolutist Restoration.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} <b>congruences</b> between arithmetically {{interesting}} numbers {{has a long}} history and plays important roles in several areas of number theory. Examples of such <b>congruences</b> include the Kummer <b>congruences</b> between Bernoulli numbers and <b>congruences</b> between coefficients of modular forms. Many of these <b>congruences</b> could be interpreted as <b>congruences</b> between special values of L-functions of arithmetic objects (motives). In recent years general conjectures [B-K] have been formulated relating these special values to the Selmer groups and other arithmetic invariants of the associated motives. In view of these conjectures, <b>congruences</b> between special values should give certain <b>congruences</b> between the corresponding Selmer groups. In this paper, we take {{a different point of view}} by studying <b>congruences</b> between Selmer groups and deducing consequences of such <b>congruences</b> to the <b>congruences</b> of special values. Roughly speaking, given two Galois representations that are congruent on a finite level, i. e., that become isomorphic representations modulo a prime power, we consider the relation between the corresponding Selmer groups. Precise definitions will be given in later sections. We will focus on the Selmer groups defined by Bloch and Kato [B-K] and will provide <b>congruences</b> when the congruent Galois representations are from cyclotomic characters, Hecke characters from CM elliptic curves, and from adjoints of modular forms. We also display consequences of such <b>congruences</b> to the <b>congruences</b> of special values of L-functions, in particular, to special values of the Riemann zeta function. It is interesting to observe that the <b>congruences</b> of special values obtained this way are different from the classical <b>congruences,</b> such as the Kummer <b>congruences.</b> Methods used in this paper are mostly from Iwasawa theory, including the classical theory originated from Iwasawa [Iw] and the ”horizontal ” theory recently develope...|$|R
