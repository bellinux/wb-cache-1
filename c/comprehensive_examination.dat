25|$|The {{origin of}} the first Law Commission of India lies in the diverse and often {{conflicting}} laws prevailing in the local regions and those administered by the East India Company, which was granted Royal Charters and also conferred powers by the various Indian rulers to administer and oversee {{the conduct of the}} inhabitants in the local areas where the Company exercised control. During this period of administration by the Company, two sets of laws operated in the areas; one which applied to and in relation to British citizens and the second which applied to the local inhabitants and aliens. This was considered as a major stumbling block for proper administration by the British Government during the times which is now known as the British Raj. In order to improve the law and order situation and also to ensure uniformity of legal administration, various options were looked for. Until then the British Government had been passing various enactments to deal with particular situations, such as the Prohibition of Sati in (1829) by Lord William Bentinck under the influence of Raja Ram Mohan Roy. However it was {{for the first time in}} (1833) that the idea to establish a Law Commission for a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>examination</b> of the existing legal system prevailing in the British administered areas and its overhaul was instituted.|$|E

30|$|PoCUS {{is based}} on the premise that the {{examinations}} are acceptable for their intended purpose but inferior in quality when compared to <b>comprehensive</b> <b>examinations.</b> However, the PoCUS examinations excel in speed and availability for every patient and are as accessible as the stethoscope. The conventional pyramid is static and leaves no room for PoCUS to offer superiority on any parameter compared to <b>comprehensive</b> <b>examinations.</b> If the physician performing PoCUS rises to a higher level of expertise in the pyramid, speed is lost, as the examiner extends the exam toward something more comprehensive and time consuming. Availability is also lost, as only a few doctors (who are not always present in the department) can be expected to perform the examination at the expert level. Hence climbing the pyramid of expertise also weakens the product.|$|R

2500|$|In 2005, Bartlett's book The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil was published. The 200,000-word study {{applies the}} science of {{pathology}} to the human species {{in order to identify}} and describe many dispositionally-based pathologies that afflict our species, often without our awareness. A central purpose of the book is to bring together and discuss the work of twentieth century psychologists, psychiatrists, ethologists, psychologically-focused historians, and others who have studied the underlying psychology of human aggression and destructiveness. The conclusions of the study emphasize that human pathology has many originating factors, that people obtain varied cognitive and emotional gratifications from such pathology, and that human pathology is a normal human condition and is therefore generally intractable, at least at this stage of human development. Bartlett describes how deficits in what he defines as moral intelligence combine with the psychology of stupidity, which together form major contributors to the psychological shortcomings that result in human pathology. In critical responses to the book, the study was commended by The Journal of Analytical Psychology: [...] "Bartlett is a lucid, painstaking and illuminating writer. This is certainly a classic work of reference in the field." [...] The Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic appraised the book as [...] "a challenging and thought provoking approach that makes a significant contribution to an aspect of human psychopathology that is rarely or so comprehensively addressed." [...] About the book, M. Scott Peck commented: [...] "he study of evil is just beginning and you are a pioneer." [...] Eric Zillmer, Carl R. Pacifico Professor of Neuropsychology at Drexel University, commended the book: [...] "Steven James Bartlett's The Pathology of Man marks the most <b>comprehensive</b> <b>examination</b> of evil to date. Drawing from different fields of study, including psychology and epistemology, Bartlett sets out on a Tour de Force of delineating the parameters on human evil.... The resulting text is a most welcome addition to the field and provides for fascinating reading. The Pathology of Man is a timely, scholarly, and important piece of work that should appeal to anyone who is interested in understanding human evil." [...] Author and President of the Jewish Life Network Irving Greenberg commented: [...] "This book is stunning, upsetting, gripping.... he book is a moral act of the highest order. These...comments would be incomplete without mentioning the erudition, the intellectual insight and playfulness, the gallows humor and the self-restraint which deepen and lighten this book." [...] Since the publication of The Pathology of Man, Bartlett has published a series of further books and papers related to the same and related subjects.|$|E
