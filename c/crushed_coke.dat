50|$|The most {{important}} properties of coke are ash and sulfur content, which {{are dependent on}} the coal used for production. Coke with less ash and sulfur content is highly priced on the market. Other important characteristics are the M10, M25, and M40 test crush indexes, which convey the strength of coke during transportation into the blast furnaces; depending on blast furnaces size, finely <b>crushed</b> <b>coke</b> pieces must not be allowed into the blast furnaces because they would impede the flow of gas through the charge of iron and coke. A related characteristic is the Coke Strength After Reaction (CSR) index; it represents coke's ability to withstand the violent conditions inside the blast furnace before turning into fine particles.|$|E

40|$|The lecture {{analyses}} {{the problem}} of development of the pipe conveyor with a rubber belt, the facitities of its application in the practice and environmental aspects resulting from its application. The pipe conveyor is a new perspective transport system. It enables ransporting bulk materials (coal, <b>crushed,</b> rock, <b>coke,</b> plant ash, fertilisers, limestones, time in a specific operations (power plants, heating plants). cellulose, salt, sugar, wheat and other materials) with a minimum effect on the environment. The transported material is enclosed in the pipeline {{so that there is}} no escape of dust, smell or of the transported material itself. The lecture is aimed at: - the short description of the operating principle and design of the pipe conveyor which was developed in the firm Matador Púchov in cooperation with the firm TEDO, - the analysis of experiencie in working some pipe conveyors which were under operation for a certai...|$|R

30|$|<b>Coke</b> <b>crushing</b> {{and surface}} ash aggregations {{are the main}} {{processes}} that determine the size distribution of coarse mode particles. Therefore, the boiler type that determines the combustion process, boiler load, coal type, and other factors (Yoo et al. 2002; Maguhn et al. 2003; Ninomiya et al. 2004; Zhang and Ninomiya 2006) affects, to a large extent, the initial particle concentration and particle size distribution. By measuring the emissions of power plants, {{it has also been}} found that the type of boiler (Liu et al. 2010), boiler load (Yi et al. 2006) and coal type (Giere et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2011; Xue and Wang 2013) influence PM 2.5 concentration and particle size distribution at the entrance of precipitators.|$|R
30|$|The {{distribution}} of particle size at the inlet of power plant precipitators is obviously bimodal. The peaks occur near 1 and 10  μm in Fig.  2. The two peaks reflect two different mechanisms of particle {{formation in the}} process of coal combustion. Fine particles result mainly from the gasification-condensation process of inorganic matter in coal, and coarse particles consist mainly of residual minerals from the <b>coke.</b> The <b>coke</b> <b>crushing</b> and aggregation of surface ash are the main processes that determine the eventual size {{distribution of}} coarse particles. Also, for the coal types that contain more external minerals, mineral crushing also has a highly significant influence on the formation of residual ash particles. The size distribution of particles at the entrance of the precipitator in power plant 4, which was a chain boiler, differed slightly from the size distribution of other power plants.|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 47 Many {{centrifugal}} pump vibration problems {{are due to}} synchronous phenomena such as vane-pass frequency energy and running speed energy. To address such problems, guidelines {{have been developed to}} assist with their identification and to evaluate their severity. However, nonsynchronous phenomenon such as recirculation, stage-stall, and shaft instabilities can also cause vibration problems. These types of problems are more difficult or diagnose, since the excitation mechanisms are less obvious. Discussed herein are field measurements and computer analysis that were done to analyze and solve supersynchronous shaft vibration problem on a two-stage horizontal centrifugal <b>coke</b> <b>crusher</b> pump and a vertical single-stage centrifugal water pump. These pumps were marginally stable at low discharge pressures, but were unstable at high discharge pressures. Field tests indicated that the shaft instability vibrations of both pumps could be removed by installing vanes on {{the back side of the}} impellers (?pumpout? vanes). Although the pumpout vanes were very effective in eliminating the destabilizing forces on these pumps, the exact effects of the pumpout vanes on the rotor instabilities are not clearly understood. The authors feel that additional analytical and experimental work should be conducted to fully understand the effects of the pumpout vanes...|$|R
40|$|The {{pneumatic}} conveying of bulk solids through pipelines {{has been used}} in industry for several decades. With the introduction in recent years of new techniques and more efficient hardware, there has been a considerable increase in the use of this method of transport (e. g. dense-phase, low-velocity and long-distance conveying). Unfortunately, the technology available to assess the relative merits of the large number of commercial systems that now compete for a particular application is lacking sadly, especially when efficient and reliable dense-phase or long-distance transportation is required. The main objective of this thesis is to provide industry with some of this technology in relation to fine powders (e. g. pulverised coal, fly ash, PVC powder, fly ash/cement mix) and some coarser products (e. g. screened <b>coke,</b> <b>crushed</b> bath, granulated aluminate). A convenient method for presenting the variation of major steady-state conveying parameters is needed for efficient design, system evaluation and optimisation. One technique based on other work and extended to include saltation and minimum transport behaviour is established. A standardised-test procedure comprising three different types of {{pneumatic conveying}} experiment also is developed to generate efficiently the data required for this purpose. The method of scaling up test rig data to full-scale installations, previously used quite extensively in the design of pneumatic conveying systems, is investigated and found to be inadequate in particular applications. Two popular forms of definition and three existing empirical correlations for the solids pressure drop are modified to demonstrate the possible extent of this inadequacy. Steady-state pipeline conveying characteristics of three products are used in the development of an improved scale-up procedure. Methods to predict the air-only pressure drop for both single- and stepped-diameter pipelines and to generalise the conveying characteristics of a particular material (applicable to other combinations of length and diameter) also are formulated and verified. Pulverised coal conveyed over 25 m and fly ash over 943 and 293 m (utilising three different configurations of blow tank) are used to investigate the effect of blow tank air injection on the performance of a pneumatic conveying system. The addition of supplementary conveying-air to a blow tank incorporating a top-air supply and transporting a good dense-phase material (pulverised coal) is shown to achieve higher values of mass flow ratio and/or conveying rate and also provide smoother and more consistent transportation. The installation of a fluidising discharge cone to the outlet of a blow tank conveying a cohesive fly ash is found to improve the discharge characteristics of the blow tank, as well as decrease pressure and flow rate fluctuations. The method of air injection also is found to {{have a significant impact on}} the plug-phase mode of conveying. Experiments on three different products are carried out to demonstrate the advantages of this method of transport (i. e. to handle conventionally difficult dense-phase materials, such as crushed bath) but also its sensitivity to changes in material property (viz. particle size). However, it is shown further that this may be compensated to some extent by selecting a different method of air injection. Two powder classification techniques based on physical properties are evaluated and found useful in explaining and indicating the minimum transport (dense-phase) behaviour for a wide range of materials. The steady-state pipeline conveying characteristics (dilute- and dense-phase) and the fluidisation behaviour of ten products are compared for this purpose. Various mathematical models utilising numerical integration and analytical approximations are formulated to predict blow tank performance characteristics. Despite the lack of good accurate data for the experimental verification of these models (i. e. due to certain difficulties in measurement technique), preliminary results still are obtained and presented in graphical format. Five existing pipeline theories also are investigated and reviewed. One particular model is found useful in predicting the dense-phase conveying parameters of fine powders, and a worked example is presented. The applicability of generalised solids friction factor correlations to the design of pneumatic conveying systems is reviewed. The resulting degree of uncertainty is considered too great for applications involving relatively high operating pressures (e. g. long-distance and/or large-throughput conveying). Test rig data obtained from pulverised coal, a fly ash/cement mix and various fly ash samples are used to identify certain areas of improvement. Based on this work, a test-design procedure is developed to determine an accurate solids friction factor correlation (i. e. for a given material and a wide range of diameters). Results from recent investigations into the long-distance pneumatic conveying of pulverised coal are used to demonstrate the good accuracy and reliability of this improved approach...|$|R
