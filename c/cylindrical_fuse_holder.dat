50|$|Cutouts are {{typically}} mounted about 20 degrees off vertical {{so that the}} center of gravity of the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> is displaced and the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> will rotate and fall open under its own weight when the fuse blows. Mechanical tension on the fuse link normally holds an ejector spring in a stable position. When the fuse blows, the released spring pulls the stub of the fuse link out of the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> tube to reduce surge duration and damage to the transformer and <b>fuse</b> <b>holder.</b> This quenches any arc in the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder.</b>|$|R

When the contained fuse melts ("blows"), the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> drops out of the upper contact, breaking the circuit, and hangs from a hinge on its lower end. This hanging <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> provides a visible indication that the fuse has operated and assurance that the circuit is open. The circuit can also be opened manually by pulling out the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> using a hot stick.|$|R

The explosion of <b>fuse</b> <b>holders</b> at a certain 161 kV: 34. 5 kV Ameren UE substation in the Potosi area was investigated. The Alternative Transients Program -Electromagnetic Transients Program (ATP-EMTP) was used to model and simulate the electrical behavior of transient overcurrents and overvoltages created by switching events in an effort to identify the cause of damage to a certain <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> used to protect the 4. 5 MVAR capacitor bank on the 34. 5 kV side of the transformer.

50|$|These {{and other}} fuses {{are still being}} {{manufactured}} for many applications, including for AC circuits and DC uses.

50|$|Fuse {{packages}} {{may include}} a rejection feature {{such as a}} pin, slot, or tab, which prevents interchange of otherwise similar appearing fuses.

50|$|Some early 1900s battery holders {{were often}} {{no more than}} a {{cardboard}} box with copper contacts. By the 1920s, battery holders used twin metal clips (like <b>fuse</b> <b>holders)</b> to hold the battery in place while making electrical contact. Patent no. 1439429 was granted in Dec., 1922 for an assembly with two spring arm clips, a small switch and a lamp assembly on the end of connected wires.|$|R
50|$|D-type (Diazed) fuse {{cartridges}} have a bottle-shaped {{ceramic body}} with metal end caps and are fitted in screw-in <b>fuse</b> <b>holders.</b> They {{are available in}} five different body sizes, with ratings from 2 A up to 200 A (see table). The designation of a size consists of the letter D and a Roman numeral. Higher-voltage types rated up to 750 V have increased clearance distances and are longer than lower-voltage-rated fuses.|$|R
5000|$|Unofficially, the [...] "low-profile mini" [...] fuse is {{sometimes}} incorrected called [...] "micro" [...] since the term means smaller than mini, but recently fuses using the micro name have been released. Regular blade-type fuses, {{also known as}} standard fuses, were developed in 1976 for low voltage use in motor vehicles. The mini fuses were developed in the 1990s. Blade type fuses can be mounted in fuse blocks, in-line <b>fuse</b> <b>holders,</b> or <b>fuse</b> clips.|$|R
50|$|Automotive fuses {{are used}} to protect the wiring and {{electrical}} equipment for vehicles. There are several different types of automotive fuses and their usage is dependent upon the specific application, voltage, and current demands of the electrical circuit. Automotive fuses can be mounted in fuse blocks, inline <b>fuse</b> <b>holders,</b> or <b>fuse</b> clips. Some automotive fuses are occasionally used in non-automotive electrical applications. Standards for automotive fuses are published by SAE International (formerly known as the Society of Automotive Engineers).|$|R
40|$|Circuit breakers, {{disconnectors}}, fuse disconnectors and <b>fuse</b> <b>holders</b> {{installed in}} LV electric panels sometimes suffer overheating, mainly due to inadequate dissipation {{of the heat}} generated. A theoretical and experimental investigation is attempted of the mechanisms that can affect heat transfer to a component-conductor system, as well the mass and the external surface area of the component. The resulting system of differential equations is solved using the Laplace transform in the s-plane. The time-dependent temperature distribution in the component-conductor system is provided by an analytical expression, and a simple formula is given for the component's stabilised temperature. Results from the models are compared with experimental measurements performed on a <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> and are shown to be consistent. The model accuracy is also investigated. It is convincingly shown that excessive (or additional) external surface area of the component's metallic parts reduces the component temperature. Above a certain level, this can make the component act as a cooler of the conductor. In addition, an increase of the component's mass slows temperature stabilisation. The proposed model could effectively support component design as it involves all the technical characteristics of the system, so that the requirements of international standards are fulfilled {{in relation to the}} prevention of overheating. © IEE, 2005...|$|R
50|$|The <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> on a cutout {{can also}} be {{replaced}} with a mechanism designed {{to function as a}} sectionalizer, to be used on a distribution line downstream from autoreclosing circuit breakers. Autoreclosers sense and briefly interrupt fault currents, and then automatically reclose to restore service. Meanwhile, downstream sectionalizers automatically count current interruptions by the recloser. When a sectionalizer detects a preset number of interruptions of fault current (typically 3 or 4) the sectionalizer opens (while unenergized) and remains open, and the recloser restores supply to the other non-fault sections.|$|R
50|$|The mine {{consisted}} of a large cylindrical main body containing a 60 mm mortar shell linked by a steel tube to a <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> which held either a pressure fuse or a pull fuse for use with tripwires. A rectangular thin metal plate positioned halfway up {{the main body of}} the mine provides additional support. When the fuse is triggered, a flash travels along the steel tube to the base of the main body, where it ignites a 0.8 g black powder charge, launching the mortar shell from the mine and igniting a pyrotechnic delay.|$|R
5000|$|Each <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> {{typically}} has an attached {{pull ring}} {{that can be}} engaged by a hook {{at the end of}} a fiberglass hot stick operated by a lineworker standing on the ground or from a bucket truck, to manually open the switch. While often used for switching, the standard cutout shown is not designed to be manually opened under load. For applications where the switch is likely to be used to interrupt power manually, a [...] "load break" [...] version is available that has an attachment to quench the arc.|$|R
5000|$|The larger end cap (the [...] "bottom" [...] of the bottle) has at its centre a small {{spring-loaded}} button {{retained by}} a thin wire, {{which serves as a}} [...] "fuse blown" [...] indicator. When the fuse blows, the wire breaks and the indicator button is ejected by the spring. A missing or displaced indicator thus pinpoints a blown fuse. The removable part of the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> has a small window to allow inspection of the indicator without removal of the fuse. The indicator button usually has a coloured dot indicating the fuse rating (see table).|$|R
5000|$|The {{smaller end}} cap (the [...] "top" [...] of the bottle) has a {{diameter}} that {{varies with the}} fuse rating: higher ratings have wider end caps. The fixed part of the <b>fuse</b> <b>holder</b> contains a (usually colour-coded) gauge ring, which will accept end caps {{up to a certain}} diameter. It is therefore not possible to fit a fuse of a higher rating than allowed for by the gauge ring. The size of the gauge ring is determined by the current rating of the circuit to be protected. Gauge rings are intended to be changed only by authorized personnel.|$|R

In GEO 600 <b>cylindrical</b> <b>fused</b> silica fibres were produced using a hydrogen-oxygen flame based machine. Here we report on a new CO 2 laser based fibre pulling system under development in Glasgow designed to achieve higher tolerances and reduce contamination of fibres. Preliminary testing of a laser welding process suitable for constructing full scale monolithic suspensions for advanced detectors is described. ...|$|R
