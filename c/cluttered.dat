For a <b>clutter</b> C, the tilde <b>clutter</b> is the set of hyperedges of C which intersect any minimum transversal in exactly one element. We divide the (non-) existence problem of an ideal minimally non-packing <b>clutter</b> D into two steps. In the first step, we give necessary conditions for C = the tilde <b>clutter</b> of D when a <b>clutter</b> D is an ideal minimally non-packing <b>clutter.</b> In the second step, for a <b>clutter</b> C satisfying the conditions in the first step, we consider whether C has an ideal minimally non-packing <b>clutter</b> D with C= the tilde <b>clutter</b> of D.

40|$|Abstract: For {{the issue}} of MIMO {{airborne}} radar <b>clutter</b> modeling in different environment conditions, a <b>clutter</b> modeling method based on composite model is proposed. It builds different types of <b>clutter</b> model through the changes of model parameters. The <b>clutter</b> model consists of <b>clutter</b> amplitude distribution model, and <b>clutter</b> cell scattering model. After considering the error factors such as element error, channel error, <b>clutter</b> fluctuation, a <b>clutter</b> modeling method based on composite model under error conditions is proposed. Finally, the computer simulation is made about the amplitude, the back-scatter coefficient, error factors, the space-time MV spectrum and the characteristic spectrum {{of different types of}} <b>clutter</b> through changing the model parameters. The simulation results show that: In ideal conditions, the <b>Clutter</b> Spectrum has good space-time characteristic, but in error conditions, the <b>clutter</b> fluctuates tempestuously, and in different environment conditions the fluctuation degree is different...|$|R

5|$|The MSR was an S-band passive {{electronically}} scanned array (PESA), {{unlike the}} actively scanned MAR. A PESA system cannot (normally) generate multiple signals like AESA, but {{is much less}} expensive to build because a single transmitter and receiver {{is used for the}} entire system. The same antenna array can easily be used for both transmitting and receiving, as the area behind the array is much less <b>cluttered</b> and has ample room for switching in spite of the large radio frequency switches needed at this level of power.|$|E
5|$|The F-16A/B was {{originally}} {{equipped with the}} Westinghouse AN/APG-66 fire-control radar. Its slotted planar array antenna {{was designed to be}} compact to fit into the F-16's relatively small nose. In uplook mode, the APG-66 uses a low pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) for medium- and high-altitude target detection in a low-clutter environment, and in look-down/shoot-down employs a medium PRF for heavy clutter environments. It has four operating frequencies within the X band, and provides four air-to-air and seven air-to-ground operating modes for combat, even at night or in bad weather. The Block 15's APG-66(V)2 model added a more powerful signal processing, higher output power, improved reliability and increased range in <b>cluttered</b> or jamming environments. The Mid-Life Update (MLU) program introduced a new model, APG-66(V)2A, which features higher speed and more memory.|$|E

Realizing that the difficulty in sea <b>clutter</b> modeling is due to the multiscale nature of sea <b>clutter,</b> we employ a new multiscale complexity measure, the scale-dependent Lyapunov exponent (SDLE), to better characterize the nonstationary and multiscale nature of sea <b>clutter.</b> SDLE has been shown to readily characterize major models of complex time series, including deterministic chaos, noisy chaos, stochastic oscillations, random processes, random Levy processes, and complex time series with multiple scaling behaviors. With SDLE, we are able to directly show that sea <b>clutter</b> is not chaotic. More importantly, we find a new scaling law suggesting noisy dynamics for sea <b>clutter.</b> The new scaling law has an interesting interpretation in terms of intrinsic predictability of sea <b>clutter,</b> and provides an excellent new means of detecting targets within sea <b>clutter...</b>|$|R

5|$|Jarvis and DeMar playtested {{the game}} themselves, and {{continually}} tweaked the designs {{as the project}} progressed. Though games at the time began to use scrolling to have larger levels, the developers chose a single screen to confine the action. To instill panic in the player, the character was initially placed {{in the center of}} the game's action, and had to deal with projectiles coming from multiple directions, as opposed previous shooting games such as Space Invaders and Galaxian, where the enemies attacked from a single direction. This made for more challenging gameplay, an aspect Jarvis took pride in. Enemies were assigned to stages in different groups to create themes. Early stages were designed to be relatively simple compared to later ones. The level of difficulty was designed to increase quickly so players would struggle to complete later stages. In retrospect, Jarvis attributes his and DeMar's average player skills to the game's balanced design. Though they made the game as difficult as they could, the high end of their skills ended up being a good challenge for expert players. The graphics were given a simple appearance to avoid a <b>cluttered</b> game screen, and object designs were made distinct from each other to avoid confusion. Black was chosen as the background color to help characters stand out and reduce clutter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Sea <b>clutter</b> {{refers to}} the radar {{backscatter}} from a patch of ocean surface. To properly characterize radar <b>clutter</b> returns, {{a lot of effort}} has been made to fit various distributions to the observed amplitude data of sea <b>clutter.</b> However, the fitting of real sea <b>clutter</b> data using those distributions is not satisfactory. This {{may be due to the}} fact that sea <b>clutter</b> data is highly nonstationary. This nonstationarity motivates us to perform distributional analysis on the data obtained by differentiating the amplitude data of sea <b>clutter.</b> By systematically analyzing differentiated data of 280 sea <b>clutter</b> time series measured under various sea and weather conditions, we show that the Tsallis distribution fits sea <b>clutter</b> data much better than commonly used distributions for sea <b>clutter</b> such as the K distribution.

5|$|Arboreal animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more <b>cluttered</b> habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|E
