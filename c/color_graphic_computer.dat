Selecting 'RGB mode' at the title screen would instead result in the usual 320&times;200 CGA graphics mode limited to 4 colors. In this mode, dithering was employed to simulate extra colors. Like previous static-screen Sierra adventures, King's Quest used vector graphics rather than pre-rendered bitmaps which would take far too much disk space. Each screen is drawn line-by-line and painted in. This technique was used on all Sierra adventure games up to King's Quest V.|$|R

It is, therefore, also important to develop effective techniques for computer-user data transfer which match the computer's computational speed. In order to satisfy such requirements, powerful engineering workstations and three-dimensional <b>color</b> <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> codes were employed in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses of the Shuttle's engine.

40|$|<b>Color</b> <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> {{techniques}} were investigated {{as a means}} of rapidly scanning and interpreting large sets of transient heating data. The data presented were generated to support the conceptual design of a heat-sink thermal protection system (TPS) for a hypersonic research airplane. Color-coded vector and raster displays of the numerical geometry used in the heating calculations were employed to analyze skin thicknesses and surface temperatures of the heat-sink TPS under a variety of trajectory flight profiles. Both vector and raster displays proved to be effective means for rapidly identifying heat-sink mass concentrations, regions of high heating, and potentially adverse thermal gradients. The color-coded (raster) surface displays are a very efficient means for displaying surface-temperature and heating histories, and thereby the more stringent design requirements can quickly be identified. The related hardware and software developments required to implement both the vector and the raster displays for this application are also discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Goofus and GallantFirst {{appearing}} in Highlights in 1948, Goofus and Gallant is a cartoon feature created by Garry Cleveland Myers and drawn by Anni Matsick. The strip features two contrasting boys, Goofus and Gallant. In each cartoon, it is shown how each boy {{would respond to}} the same situation. Goofus chooses an irresponsible and immature path, while Gallant chooses a responsible, mature and kind path. Often the panels would provide description, such as on a school bus: Goofus hogs his seat - Gallant makes space {{for someone else to}} sit down. Sometimes the situations would show the boys talking, such as phone courtesy when parents are away: Goofus: [...] "Someone called but I forgot their name." [...] Gallant: [...] "Someone called for you. I wrote down their name and number". Goofus and Gallant's primary function is to teach children basic social skills. Originally drawn in black and white, Goofus and Gallant changed to colored pencils in 1994 and later changed to <b>colored</b> <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> in December 2005.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new color model, RBW, {{which can be}} used as an intuitive user-interface for selecting <b>colors</b> in <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> systems. It is based on the red-green, blue-yellow, and white-black color axes. These axes are similar to the axes in opponent color theory, but their semantics are different: in the RBW model, the white-black axis mixes white or black into the color rather than controlling the achromatic brightness. The RBW model has the advantages of opponent color models plus additional benefits: the color gamut has a simple cubical shape, color coordinates are assigned according to simple rules, and all basic colors are at gridpoints in the cube.
