50|$|There is {{also the}} issue of analyst firms signing {{boilerplate}} <b>confidentiality</b> <b>agreements</b> with vendor firms.

Some research organizations now refuse to sign <b>confidentiality</b> <b>agreements</b> with vendors or service providers. But there may be a legacy of agreements in place that perpetually limit disclosure for some large vendor clients, so some of the smaller firms have limited work with vendors.|$|R
