5|$|Historically, optical astronomy, {{also called}} visible light astronomy, {{is the oldest}} form of astronomy. Images of {{observations}} were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century {{and most of the}} 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using <b>charge-coupled</b> devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 Å to 7000 Å (400 nm to 700nm), that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation.|$|E
5|$|Individual photons can be {{detected}} by several methods. The classic photomultiplier tube exploits the photoelectric effect: a photon of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons. Semiconductor <b>charge-coupled</b> device chips use a similar effect: an incident photon generates a charge on a microscopic capacitor that can {{be detected}}. Other detectors such as Geiger counters use the ability of photons to ionize gas molecules contained in the device, causing a detectable change of conductivity of the gas.|$|E
5|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) {{has been}} used to perform {{systematic}} studies of Mars and has taken the highest resolution images of Mars ever captured from Earth. This telescope can produce useful images of the planet when it is at an angular distance of at least 50° from the Sun. The HST can take images of a hemisphere, which yields views of entire weather systems. Earth-based telescopes equipped with <b>charge-coupled</b> devices can produce useful images of Mars, allowing for regular monitoring of the planet's weather during oppositions.|$|E
5000|$|The 2.12 m {{telescope}} was built between 1974 and 1979 and is tied as Mexico's largest optical telescope. It has secondary mirrors of f/7.5, f/13.5 or f/30. Direct imaging and optical spectroscopy are performed {{with a number}} of different <b>charge-couple</b> devices and spectrographs.|$|R
40|$|A novel x-ray area {{detector}} {{based on}} a large format <b>charge-couple</b> device (CCD) imaging array has been con-structed and characterized It was found to exhibit high signal to noise ratio, wide dynamic range and high spatial resolution. Tests with both conventional and synchrotron sources showed the detector to be highly suitable for x-ray diffraction studies...|$|R
40|$|Space {{saved and}} interelectrode short {{circuits}} eliminated. Proposed virtual-phase, interline-transfer, <b>charge-couple</b> device uses single gate electrode to control both interline and intraline transfer of charge. Voltage on single control electrode varied to transfer charge from photosites to shift register, or else along sift register. Two kinds of transfer independent of each other. Charge transferred along shift register when voltage on control electrode alternated between gate potentials...|$|R
5|$|Study of Saturn's moons {{has also}} been aided by {{advances}} in telescope instrumentation, primarily the introduction of digital <b>charge-coupled</b> devices which replaced photographic plates. For the entire 20th century, Phoebe stood alone among Saturn's known moons with its highly irregular orbit. Beginning in 2000, however, three dozen additional irregular moons have been discovered using ground-based telescopes. A survey starting in late 2000 and conducted using three medium-size telescopes found thirteen new moons orbiting Saturn at a great distance, in eccentric orbits, which are highly inclined to both the equator of Saturn and the ecliptic. They are probably fragments of larger bodies captured by Saturn's gravitational pull. In 2005, astronomers using the Mauna Kea Observatory announced the discovery of twelve more small outer moons, in 2006, astronomers using the Subaru 8.2m telescope reported the discovery of nine more irregular moons, in , Tarqeq (S/2007 S 1) was announced and in May {{of the same year}} S/2007 S 2 and S/2007 S 3 were reported.|$|E
5|$|When {{a crystal}} is mounted and exposed to an intense beam of X-rays, it {{scatters}} the X-rays into {{a pattern of}} spots or reflections that can be observed on a screen behind the crystal. A similar pattern may be seen by shining a laser pointer at a compact disc. The relative intensities of these spots provide the information to determine the arrangement of molecules within the crystal in atomic detail. The intensities of these reflections may be recorded with photographic film, an area detector or with a <b>charge-coupled</b> device (CCD) image sensor. The peaks at small angles correspond to low-resolution data, whereas those at high angles represent high-resolution data; thus, an upper limit on the eventual resolution of the structure can be determined from the first few images. Some measures of diffraction quality can be determined at this point, such as the mosaicity of the crystal and its overall disorder, as observed in the peak widths. Some pathologies of the crystal that would render it unfit for solving the structure can also be diagnosed quickly at this point.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} impose {{adequate}} contamination control requirements {{in the selection}} of Wide Field Planetary Camera (WFPC) materials and to develop a data base of potential optical degradation of the WFPC <b>charge-couple</b> device window, the outgassing properties of WFPC materials and the collected volatile condensed material (CVCM) effects on MgF 2 transmittance were measured. Changes in the transmittance were monitored in the wavelength region from 115 nm to 300 nm for selected CVCM thicknesses up to 150 nm. The outgassing properties of reemitted CVCM were also studied...|$|R
40|$|A {{high-performance}} thin-layer chromatographic (HPTLC) separation system {{coupled with}} a scientifically operated <b>charge-couple</b> device detector (CCD) has been developed to improve the identification and quantitative analysis of pharmaceutical products and natural toxins. The combination of the fast, easy and high throughput properties of TLC, high speed, sensitivity, wide dynamic range of the CCD detector, and the high reproducibility and accuracy of the micro-nebulization sampler {{can be used to}} facilitate pharmaceutical industrial quality control and food industrial safety control. The application of this system in these areas has shown significant improvement in sensitivity, precision, and accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this work, a new <b>charge-coupling</b> {{structure}} of RSO MOSFET with slope field plate is proposed. The design method is developed by theoretical analysis. In addition, a fabrication method using multi-plate to fit slope method is introduced. Then, a 250 V structure was simulated {{to verify the}} theoretical analysis by TCAD. It is demonstrated that the structure overcomes the non-uniformity of electric field in drift region in traditional RSO MOSFET. The trade-off between the Ron and BV— “silicon limit ” has been broken, for the Rdson= 116 mΩ/mm 2 in this structure...|$|R

25|$|P–n photodiodes are {{not used}} to measure {{extremely}} low light intensities. Instead, if high sensitivity is needed, avalanche photodiodes, intensified <b>charge-coupled</b> devices or photomultiplier tubes are used for applications such as astronomy, spectroscopy, night vision equipment and laser rangefinding.|$|E
25|$|In 1969 Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith {{invented the}} first {{successful}} imaging technology using a digital sensor, a CCD (<b>Charge-Coupled</b> Device). CCD would allow the rapid development of digital photography. For their contribution to digital photography Boyle and Smith were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{brief review of}} charge-redistrbution effects in <b>charge-couple</b> devices observed in both flat-field and spot data. Experiments are described that allow such phenomenon to be measured simply in the parallel transfer direction using only equipment capable of providing flat-field illuminations. A more detailed investigation into signal-dependant PSF shape distortions are descibed for both p- and n-channel CCDs of identical design. A number of methods to minimise the effect are presented that include different image electrode configurations and bias levels during integration and novel pixel architectures...|$|R
40|$|Charge Routing Network (CRN) {{is a term}} which {{indicates}} a family of functional solid-state electronic devices using MOS <b>charge-coupling</b> technology. Under {{the application of a}} sequence of clock pulses, these devices move quantities of electrical charge across a semiconductor substrate thus performing a wide range of electronic functions including image sensing, data storage, signal processing or logic operations. A brief description of a CRN is first given and its input-output relationship is derived. Then, under the assumption of a unique dominant pole, the class of transfer functions realizable using CRNs is characterized, and a procedure to realize a filter of this class is given. Finally, using the technique here developed, a low-pass filter is designed...|$|R
40|$|In this {{investigation}} we examine different pixel structures and readout principles {{to be used}} in imagers fabricated in standard CMOS processes, for example, the 0. 5 mu m and 0. 35 mu m processes available at the Fraunhofer IMS. The targeted applications are high-speed near-infra-red (NIR) 3 -D imaging based on time-of-ftight (TOF) measurements. We discuss various issues ranging from <b>charge-coupling</b> possibilities to noise, spectral responsivity and fill-factor, and present an extensive study of pixel configurations based on inverse biased p-n junction and MOS-C based photodetectors. We also discuss the possibilities of using a novel CMOS imaging pixel for TOF imaging applications: the charge-injection photogate (CI-PG) which presents parametric time-compression amplification. Finally, we compare and discuss all the pixel configurations examined...|$|R
25|$|P–n photodiodes {{are used}} in similar {{applications}} to other photodetectors, such as photoconductors, <b>charge-coupled</b> devices, and photomultiplier tubes. They {{may be used to}} generate an output which is dependent upon the illumination (analog; for measurement and the like), or to change the state of circuitry (digital; either for control and switching, or digital signal processing).|$|E
25|$|Recently, an {{alternative}} dye solution and microplate {{system has been}} developed called FLIPR® (fluorometric imaging plate reader), which uses a Calcium 3 assay reagent that {{does not require a}} washing step. As a result, change in dye fluorescence can be viewed in real time with no delay using an excitatory laser and a <b>charge-coupled</b> device.|$|E
25|$|With {{the arrival}} of commercially viable <b>charge-coupled</b> device (CCD) {{technology}} in the 1980s, first the pickup tubes were replaced {{with this kind of}} sensor. Later, higher scale integration electronics was applied (mainly by Sony), simplifying and even removing the intermediate optics, thereby reducing the size of home video cameras and eventually leading to the development of full camcorders. Current webcams and mobile phones with cameras are the most miniaturized commercial forms of such technology.|$|E
40|$|A single {{composite}} {{image with}} an extended intensive range {{is generated by}} combining disjoining regions from different images of the same scene. The set of images is obtained with a <b>charge-couple</b> device (CCD) set for different flux integration times. By limiting differences in the integration times so that the ranges of output pixel values overlap considerably, individual pixels are assigned the value measured at each spatial location {{that is in the}} most sensitive range where the values are both below saturation and are most precisely specified. Integration times are lengthened geometrically from a minimum where all pixel values are below saturation until all dark regions emerge from the lowest quantization level. the method is applied to an example scene and the effect the composite images have on traditional low-level imaging methods also is examined...|$|R
40|$|Flow {{visualization}} produces data in {{the form}} of two-dimensional images. If the optical components of a camera system are perfect, the transformation equations between the two-dimensional image and the three-dimensional object space are linear and easy to solve. However, real camera lenses introduce nonlinear distortions that affect the accuracy of transformation unless proper corrections are applied. An iterative least-squares adjustment algorithm is developed to solve the nonlinear transformation equations incorporated with distortion corrections. Experimental applications demonstrate that a relative precision on the order of 40, 000 is achievable without tedious laboratory calibrations of the camera. 1.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of rings surrounding Uranus has prompted reexamination of telescopic observations made {{a year ago}} with a solid-state area detector called a <b>charge-coupling</b> device (CCD). The extreme narrowness of the rings apparently caused them to be hidden in glare from the planet, the reflectivity of which is very high in the blue and green regions of the spectrum. However, Uranus appears as a much darker image in the near-infrared spectral regions detected by the CCD. Although no direct evidence of the rings is obtainable from the CCD images, some simplifying assumptions permit the deduction from the CCD data that average reflectivity of individual particles composing the rings is at most a few percent, much closer to that of carbonaceous chondritic material than {{to that of the}} ice-coated particles in Saturn's rings...|$|R
25|$|The {{invention}} of X-ray image intensifiers in the 1950s allowed {{the image on}} the screen to be visible under normal lighting conditions, as well as providing the option of recording the images with a conventional camera. Subsequent improvements included the coupling of, at first, video cameras and, later, digital cameras using image sensors such as <b>charge-coupled</b> devices or active pixel sensors to permit recording of moving images and electronic storage of still images.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Sony {{unveiled}} the first consumer camera {{to use a}} <b>charge-coupled</b> device for imaging, {{eliminating the need for}} film: the Sony Mavica. While the Mavica saved images to disk, the images were displayed on television, and the camera was not fully digital. In 1991, Kodak {{unveiled the}} DCS 100, the first commercially available digital single lens reflex camera. Although its high cost precluded uses other than photojournalism and professional photography, commercial digital photography was born.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{available}} scanners typically use <b>charge-coupled</b> device (CCD) {{or contact}} image sensor (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas older drum scanners use a photomultiplier tube as the image sensor. Early color film scanners used a halogen lamp and a three-color filter wheel, so three exposures were needed to scan a single color image. Due to heating problems, the worst of them being the potential destruction of the scanned film, this technology was later replaced by non-heating light sources such as color LEDs.|$|E
40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} shown that if we {{consider}} the higher derivative correction, the viscosity bound conjectured to be η/s= 1 / 4 π is violated and so is the causality. In this paper, we consider medium effect and the higher derivative correction simultaneously by adding charge and Gauss-Bonnet terms. We find that the viscosity bound violation is not changed by the charge. However, we find that two effects together create another instability for large momentum regime. We argue the presence of tachyonic modes and show it numerically. The stability of the black brane requires the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant λ(= 2 α'/l^ 2) to be smaller than 1 / 24. We draw a phase diagram relevant to the instability in <b>charge-coupling</b> space. Comment: 1 + 18 pages, 1 table+ 6 figures, typos corrected, references added, matches published versio...|$|R
50|$|Whole animal imaging (referred to as in vivo or, occasionally, ex vivo imaging) is a {{powerful}} technique for studying cell populations in live animals, such as mice. Different types of cells (e.g. bone marrow stem cells, T-cells) can be engineered to express a luciferase allowing their non-invasive visualization inside a live animal using a sensitive <b>charge-couple</b> device camera (CCD camera).This technique {{has been used to}} follow tumorigenesis and response of tumors to treatment in animal models. However, environmental factors and therapeutic interferences may cause some discrepancies between tumor burden and bioluminescence intensity in relation to changes in proliferative activity. The intensity of the signal measured by in vivo imaging may depend on various factors, such as D-luciferin absorption through the peritoneum, blood flow, cell membrane permeability, availability of co-factors, intracellular pH and transparency of overlying tissue, in addition to the amount of luciferase.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{bag filter}} {{is a kind}} of {{important}} de-dusting equipment in the power, metallurgy, chemical and building materials industry. Its operation efficiency and running state are two technical indexes of great importance. As for detection of the two indexes, current existing detection methods have various defects. This paper mainly introduces a bag filter on-line monitoring system based on AC charge induction. By using the international advanced AC <b>charge-coupling</b> technology and digital signal processing technology, it can accurately monitor the bag breaking state of filter and put out alarm. In the bag filter on-line monitoring process, the system well solves the technique difficulties of the measuring equipment in such aspects as anti-blocking, wear resistance, low pressure losses, accuracy and reliability, etc. It has the advantages of high measuring accuracy and easy installation and maintenance, therefore, it can bring certain economic benefits and have the prospect of popularization and application...|$|R

Telemetry from the communications antenna and other special transmitters (an S-band transmitter and a dual-frequency Ka-band system) was also used to make observations of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn and to measure the gravity fields of the planet and its satellites.|$|E
25|$|All {{semiconductors}} {{are subject}} to optical charge carrier generation. This is typically an undesired effect, so most semiconductors are packaged in light blocking material. Photodiodes are intended to sense light(photodetector), so they are packaged in materials that allow light to pass, and are usually PIN (the kind of diode most sensitive to light). A photodiode {{can be used in}} solar cells, in photometry, or in optical communications. Multiple photodiodes may be packaged in a single device, either as a linear array or as a two-dimensional array. These arrays {{should not be confused with}} <b>charge-coupled</b> devices.|$|E
25|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM, also sometimes conventional transmission {{electron microscopy}} or CTEM) is a microscopy technique in which a beam of electrons is transmitted through a specimen to form an image. The specimen is most often an ultrathin section less than 100 nm thick or a suspension on a grid. An image is formed from {{the interaction of the}} electrons with the sample as the beam is transmitted through the specimen. The image is then magnified and focused onto an imaging device, such as a fluorescent screen, a layer of photographic film, or a sensor such as a <b>charge-coupled</b> device.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a conference paper. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) {{is a modern}} non-contact, full-field optical {{technique}} {{that is being used}} for the measurement of static and dynamic displacement problems, material testing and fracture mechanics. In particular, three dimensional DIC is able to measure the out-of-plane vibration mode shapes and deformation of a vibrating structure. Thus, this technique can potentially provide an important validation tool between measured and predicted results. This paper presents some preliminary evaluation results from using the DIC measurement approach. The DIC method was implemented using two low-speed <b>charge-couple</b> device cameras and a phase-locked measurement technique synchronised to the excitation. A 1. 2 mm thick steel plate with clamped boundary conditions was chosen as the test sample. Resonant frequencies and mode shapes were compared to predictions made using a Finite Element analysis and the experimental Chladni method of visualizing vibrating mode patterns. This comparison reveals some of the advantages and limitations of the DIC method for vibration mode shape analysi...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of images}} {{obtained}} with digital non-metric cameras to metric surveying three-dimensional photogrammetric of objects, it’s investigated {{at the moment}} {{in the world by}} the specialists of the field, constituting a very current thematic and of great interest. In the presently work is exposed the results reached by the author in experiments developed in this thematic with the means and available systems in the country. The work presents results of surveying two objects of interest for the conservation of the architectural and cultural patrimony of the Old Havana; the final verification of results is made comparing magnitudes measured in the original photogrammetric with the corresponding direct measures on objects. 1.

40|$|Vision-based {{measurement}} methods {{were used to}} measure bubble sizes in this sonoluminescence experiment. Bubble imaging was accomplished by placing the bubble between a bright light source and a microscope-CCD camera system. A collimated light-emitting diode was operated in a pulsed model with an adjustable time delay {{with respect to the}} piezo-electric transducer drive signal. The light-emitting diode produced a bubble shadowgraph consisting of a multiple exposure made by numerous light pulses imaged onto a <b>charge-couple</b> device camera. Each image was transferred from the camera to a computer-controlled machine vision system via a frame grabber. The frame grabber was equipped with on-board memory to accomodate sequential image buffering while images were transferred to the host processor and analyzed. This configuration allowed the host computer to perform diameter measurements, centroid position measurements and shape estimation in "real-time" as the next image was being acquired. Bubble size measurement accuracy with an uncertainty of 3 microns was achieved using standard lenses and machine vision algorithms. Bubble centroid position accuracy was also within the 3 micron tolerance of the vision system. This uncertainty estimation accounted for the optical spatial resolution, digitization errors and the edge detection algorithm accuracy. The vision algorithms include camera calibration, thresholding, edge detection, edge position determination, distance between two edges computations and centroid position computations...|$|R
