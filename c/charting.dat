40|$|This paper proposes three synthetic-type control <b>charts</b> {{to monitor}} the mean time-between-events of a {{homogenous}} Poisson process. The first proposed <b>chart</b> combines an Erlang (cumulative time between events, Tr) <b>chart</b> and a conforming run length (CRL) <b>chart,</b> denoted as Synth-Tr <b>chart.</b> The second proposed <b>chart</b> combines an exponential (or T) <b>chart</b> and a group conforming run length (GCRL) <b>chart,</b> denoted as GR-T <b>chart.</b> The third proposed <b>chart</b> combines an Erlang <b>chart</b> and a GCRL <b>chart,</b> denoted as GR-Tr <b>chart.</b> By using a Markov chain approach, the zero- and steady-state average number of observations to signal (ANOS) of the proposed <b>charts</b> are obtained, in order to evaluate {{the performance of the}} three <b>charts.</b> The optimal design of the proposed <b>charts</b> is shown in this paper. The proposed <b>charts</b> are superior to the existing T <b>chart,</b> Tr <b>chart,</b> and Synth-T <b>chart.</b> As compared to the EWMA-T <b>chart,</b> the GR-T <b>chart</b> performs better in detecting large shifts, in terms of the zero- and steady-state performances. The zero-state Synth-T 4 and GR-Tr (r = 3 or 4) <b>charts</b> outperform the EWMA-T <b>chart</b> for all shifts, whereas the Synth-Tr (r = 2 or 3) and GR-T 2 <b>charts</b> perform better for moderate to large shifts. For the steady-state process, the Synth-Tr and GR-Tr <b>charts</b> are more efficient than the EWMA-T <b>chart</b> in detecting small to moderate shifts...|$|R
