5|$|In June 2017, it was {{reported}} that Machine Head is in the studio working on new material. In September 2017, the band announced the new album <b>Catharsis</b> for a January 2018 release with its accompanying world tour.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{attribute of}} Toraja language {{is the notion}} of grief. The importance of death ceremony in Toraja culture has characterised their languages to express intricate degrees of grief and mourning. The Toraja language contains many terms referring to sadness, longing, depression, and mental pain. Giving a clear expression of the psychological and physical effect of loss is a <b>catharsis</b> and sometimes lessens the pain of grief itself.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, a new {{band called}} Inveigh <b>Catharsis</b> formed in Des Moines, with Gray on bass, Brainard on guitar and Colsefni on drums. Jordison jammed {{occasionally}} with this group. Brainard eventually left to join Jordison and Jones in Modifidious, participating in demo recordings {{at the end}} of '93 and early in '94. During 1994 Modifidious sometimes played the same shows as Crahan's Heads on the Wall band. Gray formed a death metal band called Body Pit, soon becoming popular in the local scene. Modifidious stopped playing in the wake of death metal's increasing pull. Gray failed to get Jordison to join Body Pit, but soon after he recruited local guitar teacher Mick Thomson, the band broke up.|$|E
5|$|Although Collins {{used it as}} a <b>catharsis</b> for her {{opposition}} to the Vietnam War, two years after her rendition, the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, senior Scottish regiment of the British Army, recorded an instrumental version featuring a bagpipe soloist accompanied by a pipe and drum band. The tempo of their arrangement was slowed to allow for the bagpipes, but it was based on Collins': it began with a bagpipe solo introduction similar to her lone voice, then it was accompanied by the band of bagpipes and horns, whereas in her version she is backed up by a chorus. It topped the RPM national singles chart in Canada for three weeks, and rose as high as number 11 in the U.S. It is also a controversial instrumental, as it combined pipes with a military band. The Pipe Major of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards was summoned to Edinburgh Castle and chastised for demeaning the bagpipes. Funeral processions for killed police, fire, and military personnel have often played a bagpipes version ever since.|$|E
5|$|The unnamed Narrator is a {{traveling}} automobile recall specialist {{who suffers from}} insomnia. When he is unsuccessful at receiving medical assistance for it, the admonishing doctor suggests he realize his relatively small amount of suffering by visiting {{a support group for}} testicular cancer victims. The group assumes that he, too, is affected like they are, and he spontaneously weeps into the nurturing arms of another man, finding a freedom from the <b>catharsis</b> that relieves his insomnia. He decides to participate in support groups of various kinds, always allowing the groups to assume that he suffers what they do. However, he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence reminds him that he is attending these groups dishonestly, and this disturbs his bliss. The two negotiate to avoid their attending the same groups, but, before going their separate ways, Marla gives him her phone number.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{considerable}} variety of treatments for alleged attachment disorders diagnosed on the controversial alternative basis outlined above, popularly known as attachment therapy. These therapies {{have little or no}} evidence base and vary from talking or play therapies to more extreme forms of physical and coercive techniques, of which the best known are holding therapy, rebirthing, rage-reduction and the Evergreen model. In general these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. Critics maintain these therapies are not based on an accepted version of attachment theory. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and <b>catharsis,</b> accompanied by parenting methods which emphasise obedience and parental control. These therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver. An estimated six children have died {{as a consequence of the}} more coercive forms of such treatments and the application of the accompanying parenting techniques.|$|E
25|$|Scheff {{suggests}} that ritual provides <b>catharsis,</b> emotional purging, through distancing. This emotional distancing enables {{an individual to}} experience feelings with an amount of separation, and thus less intensity. However, the conception of religious ritual as an interactive process has since matured and become more scientifically established. From this view, ritual offers a means to <b>catharsis</b> through behaviors that foster connection with others, allowing for emotional expression. This focus on connection contrasts to the separation that seems to underlie Scheff’s view.|$|E
25|$|<b>Catharsis</b> is the {{experience}} of relief from emotional distress through the free and uninhibited expression of emotion. When members tell their story to a supportive audience, they can obtain relief from chronic feelings of shame and guilt.|$|E
25|$|Russian Heavy metal scene {{continued}} its development with power metal bands like <b>Catharsis</b> and Epidemia, {{founded in the}} 1990s, received more attention, and progressive metal band Orgia Pravednikov rising to prominence. In 2002 Valery Kipelov split from Aria, and with more ex-members of Aria he formed a new band called Kipelov, which soon compared itself to Aria in popularity.|$|E
25|$|The coffin {{was then}} interred {{in the far}} western end of the Nave, {{only a few feet}} from the entrance, in soil brought from each of the main battlefields, and covered with a silk pall. Servicemen from the armed forces stood guard as tens of {{thousands}} of mourners filed silently past. The ceremony appears to have served as a form of <b>catharsis</b> for collective mourning on a scale not previously known.|$|E
25|$|Jeremy was {{featured}} as a playable {{character in the}} Celebrity Deathmatch video game. His image {{was used as a}} fairy in the game , in which he gives tips and advice to the main character. Ron Jeremy also stars in Bonetown as the king of Bonetown and sex god. Jeremy appears in the 2011 video game Postal III as Raul Chomo, the mayor of the fictional town of <b>Catharsis,</b> Arizona.|$|E
25|$|Even {{in works}} {{that do not}} {{consciously}} draw on Graeco-Roman literature, authors often employ concepts and themes originating in ancient Greece. The ideas expressed in Aristotle's Poetics, in particular, have influenced generations of Western writers and literary critics. A Latin translation of an Arabic version of the Poetics by Averroes was available during the Middle Ages. Common Greek literary terms still used today include: <b>catharsis,</b> ethos, anagnorisis, hamartia, hubris, mimesis, mythos, nemesis, and peripeteia.|$|E
25|$|According to Canaan, from a {{young age}} singing, lyrical composition, and dancing served as an outlet and <b>catharsis.</b> At the age of eight, Canaan was awarded the first place prize (in a contest in which all grades competed against each other) by her French {{elementary}} school, College des Saints-Coeurs, Bikfaya, for a poem she composed about a child who wept for being scolded for trivial matters such as staining her fingers with ink when she writes.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} seventeen, {{the same}} age that his brother Neil had died, Hawke had a serious {{accident}} while riding his Panther motorcycle that left him in a critical condition for several days. This near-death experience acted as his <b>catharsis,</b> driving {{him to make the}} most of his talents and not let his abilities go to waste. He joined the Labor Party in 1947 at the age of eighteen, and successfully applied for a Rhodes Scholarship at the end of 1952.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} and mid-20th centuries this {{was a form of}} bowdlerisation, {{concerned}} with some of the more violent elements of nursery rhymes and {{led to the formation of}} organisations like the British 'Society for Nursery Rhyme Reform'. Psychoanalysts such as Bruno Bettelheim strongly criticized this revisionism, on the grounds that it weakened their usefulness to both children and adults as ways of symbolically resolving issues and it has been argued that revised versions may not perform the functions of <b>catharsis</b> for children, or allow them to imaginatively deal with violence and danger.|$|E
25|$|Before {{declining to}} return to active service, Sassoon had thrown his Military Cross into the River Mersey at Formby beach. According to his {{description}} of this incident in Memoirs of an Infantry Officer {{he did not do}} this as a symbolic rejection of militaristic values, but simply out of the need to perform some destructive act in <b>catharsis</b> of the black mood which was afflicting him; his account states that one of his pre-war sporting trophies, had he had one to hand, would have served his purpose equally well.|$|E
25|$|Literary {{criticism}} {{is thought to}} have existed as long as literature. In the 4th century BC Aristotle wrote the Poetics, a typology and description of literary forms with many specific criticisms of contemporary works of art. Poetics developed {{for the first time the}} concepts of mimesis and <b>catharsis,</b> which are still crucial in literary studies. Plato's attacks on poetry as imitative, secondary, and false were formative as well. Around the same time, Bharata Muni, in his Natya Shastra, wrote literary criticism on ancient Indian literature and Sanskrit drama.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the sensation that greeted the Fox sisters, demonstrations of mediumship (séances and automatic writing, for example) {{proved to be a}} profitable venture, and soon became popular forms of entertainment and spiritual <b>catharsis.</b> The Fox sisters were to earn a living this way and others would follow their lead. Showmanship became an increasingly important part of spiritualism, and the visible, audible, and tangible evidence of spirits escalated as mediums competed for paying audiences. As independent investigating commissions repeatedly established, most notably the 1887 report of the Seybert Commission, fraud was widespread, and some of these cases were prosecuted in the courts.|$|E
25|$|Spiritualists often set March 31, 1848 as the {{beginning}} of their movement. On that date, Kate and Margaret Fox, of Hydesville, reported that they had made contact with the spirit of a murdered peddler. What made this an extraordinary event was that the spirit communicated through audible rapping noises, rather than simply appearing to a person in a trance. The evidence of the senses appealed to practical Americans, and the Fox sisters became a sensation. Demonstrations of mediumship (seances and automatic writing, for example) proved to be a profitable business, and soon became popular forms of entertainment and spiritual <b>catharsis.</b> The Foxes earned a living this way, as did many others.|$|E
25|$|At {{the west}} end of the 3rd floor is El hombre controlador del universo (Man, {{controller}} of the universe- known as Man at the Crossroads), originally commissioned for New York's Rockefeller Center in 1933. The mural depicts a variety of technological and societal themes (such as the discoveries made possible by microscopes and telescopes) and was controversial for its inclusion of Lenin and a Soviet May Day parade. The Rockefellers were not happy with the painting and the incomplete work was eventually destroyed and painted over. Rivera recreated it here in 1934. On {{the north side of the}} third floor are David Alfaro Siqueiros' three-part La Nueva Democracía (New Democracy) and Rivera's four-part Carnaval de la Vida Mexicana (Carnival of Mexican Life); to the east is José Clemente Orozco's La Katharsis (<b>Catharsis),</b> depicting the conflict between humankind's 'social' and 'natural' aspects.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{believed}} that Aristotle's Poetics comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry. The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the <b>catharsis</b> of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes Poetics with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Dunham {{opened the}} Performing Arts Training Center (PATC) in East St. Louis {{as an attempt}} to use the arts to combat poverty and urban unrest. It served as a <b>catharsis</b> after the 1968 riots, during which she {{encouraged}} gang members in the ghetto to vent their frustrations with drumming and dance. The PATC drew on former members of Dunham's touring company as well as local residents for its teaching staff. While trying to help the young people in the community she was even jailed herself, making international headlines which quickly embarrassed local police officials to release her. She also continued refining and teaching the Dunham Technique to transmit that knowledge to succeeding generations of dance students, and lecturing at annual Masters' Seminars in St. Louis that attracted dance students from around the world every summer until her death. She also established the Katherine Dunham Centers for Arts and Humanities in East St. Louis to preserve Haitian and African instruments and artifacts from her own personal collection.|$|E

500|$|Presenting {{the episode}} without music was Whedon's way of denying the {{audience}} any comfort, {{forcing them to}} discern their own meanings from the characters' actions and words. As two musicologists write about this absence, [...] "Without music's acoustic balm, all our empathetic attention is on the characters and their state of bewilderment ... Music would provide a conceptualization and a <b>catharsis</b> ... but a <b>catharsis</b> at this point would in some measure trivialize the loss." [...] Television critic Gareth McLean writes that this decision is [...] "a move that makes it more courageous than, for instance, ER. There were no soaring strings or plaintive piano to trigger an emotional response. Instead the soundtrack took in the ambient noises of wind chimes, doors squeaking, footsteps on carpets. Conversations were stilted and awkward, but the spaces in between always mattered." ...|$|E

Producer James Wong felt that the episode's ending seemed overly abrupt and unexpected, describing it as appearing [...] "like we tried to play a trick on the audience to make them say 'Ooh, what the heck was that?. He added that the lack of a real connection to the episode's plot meant that the revelation lost any sense of <b>catharsis</b> for the viewer. Morgan said that the episode [...] "went too far.

[...] She tried [...] "silence and evasion," [...] yoga, Tai Chi, going to the gym, all with no results. She finally found a means to express these frustrations, by blogging. [...] Even so, she admits [...] "I can both get discouraged have sudden starts.

Lead writer Higgs spent a year writing the album, time he spent watching rolling news and enveloping himself in current events. Pritchard told the London Evening Standard that [...] "we're in an age where we're more conscious of [...] you're constantly bombarded by information". Speaking to Chris Parkin of Red Bull, Higgs explained the songwriting process provided a kind of <b>catharsis</b> following the year's events: [...] "It wasn't until after we finished that I looked back and thought, bloody hell, I was feeling that very heavily and I didn't realise until it was out of me." [...] He later described the album as a [...] "horror bible".|$|E

Thinking that it could be difficult to create an evil antagonist that readers would empathize with, Araki wrote Dio as coming from a poor family with a father [...] "with no redeeming qualities whatsoever", giving Dio motivation to acquire power and get revenge on the world even if it led him to do immoral and illegal things. Araki also noted that a character who acts without regard for morals and laws can give readers a feeling of <b>catharsis</b> due to exhibiting the same [...] "ugly feelings" [...] people hold but cannot show, making Dio more easily relatable than a character who only does good. Dio's name was taken directly from the Italian word for [...] "god", and was chosen to sound good together with the name [...] "JoJo".|$|E

The site criticized Beck's tactic of challenging those he opposes to prove a negative. Eiland-Hall told Politics Daily that after reading the initial thread at Fark which started the meme, he came to the conclusion that for those involved online participation in its propagation was a form of <b>catharsis.</b> He explained in an interview with Ars Technica that it was a means of utilizing Beck's strategies to criticize him and a way to focus exasperation around Beck's style of commentary into action.
