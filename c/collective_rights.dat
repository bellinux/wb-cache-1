However, under the standard model, the opening phrase was believed to be prefatory or amplifying to the operative clause. The opening phrase was meant as a non-exclusive example - one of many reasons for the amendment. This interpretation is consistent with the position that the Second Amendment protects a modified individual right.|$|R

40|$|This Article puts {{forward a}} new theory that reconceptualizes fair use as a <b>collective</b> user <b>right</b> in {{copyright}} law. It first argues that the fair use doctrine has not yet unleashed its full potential in protecting the public interest. The failure {{is caused by a}} firmly ingrained notion in copyright law that treats fair use as an affirmative defense against allegations of copyright infringements. Such a fixed characterization of fair use has led legislators and judges to define it as merely an individual right enjoyed by each user of copyrighted works. This characterization has also lead {{to a wide range of}} harms to the public interest in the free flow of information and knowledge. Against this backdrop, this Article explores the ways in which fair use can be revitalized to protect the public interest. It argues for repudiating the narrow-minded characterization of fair use as an individual right. It then proposes that fair use should instead be redefined as a <b>collective</b> <b>right</b> held by the public, which facilitates and enhances participation in communicative actions in what I call intangible public space. From this perspective, section 107 of the Copyright Act should be read as conferring a <b>collective</b> <b>right</b> to fair use upon members of the public. Moreover, this Article shows the power of the <b>collective</b> <b>right</b> to fair use in generating a new legal approach that will enrich copyright adjudication and policy-making discourse for protecting the public interest in the digital age. postprin...|$|R
2500|$|Collective {{linguistic}} {{rights are}} linguistic {{rights of a}} group, notably a language group or a state. <b>Collective</b> <b>rights</b> mean [...] "the right of a linguistic group to ensure the survival of its language and to transmit the language to future generations". Language groups are complex {{and more difficult to}} demarcate than states. Part of this difficulty is that members within language groups assign different roles to their language, and there are also difficulties in defining a language. Some states have legal provisions for the safeguard of collective linguistic rights because there are clear-cut situations under particular historical and social circumstances.|$|E

Quebec is a nation, and {{therefore}} it has the <b>collective</b> <b>right</b> to be an independent nation-state, and also a <b>collective</b> <b>right</b> not to be partitioned or divided.

First, Canada including French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians would be considered {{not to be a}} nation, and hence its territorial integrity does not warrant the protection given under international law to the existing borders of nation-states.

2500|$|Reviewing Forster and Epstein's work in Commentary, Earl Raab, {{founding}} {{director of}} the Nathan Perlmutter Institute for Jewish Advocacy at Brandeis University, argued that a [...] "new anti-Semitism" [...] was indeed emerging in America, {{in the form of}} opposition to the <b>collective</b> <b>rights</b> of the Jewish people, but he criticized Forster and Epstein for conflating it with anti-Israel bias. Allan Brownfeld writes that Forster and Epstein's new definition of antisemitism trivialized the concept by turning it into [...] "a form of political blackmail" [...] and [...] "a weapon with which to silence any criticism of either Israel or U.S. policy in the Middle East", while Edward S. Shapiro, in [...] "A Time for Healing: American Jewry Since World War II", has written that, [...] "Forster and Epstein implied that the new anti-Semitism was the inability of Gentiles to love Jews and Israel enough".|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, an Ontario {{court ruled}} that the {{province}} was legally obligated to keep from closing the Montfort Hospital as part of its program of merging many of the hospitals in the Ottawa region. [...] The basis for the decision was the court's conclusion that this was a logical application of an unwritten constitutional principle of minority rights, which had been found by the Supreme Court in the 1998 Reference re Secession of Quebec. [...] Since the Montfort Hospital was the only hospital in the region operating primarily in French, it amounted to a protected parallel service-provider, much as New Brunswick's French-language and English-language school systems are parallel service providers, and therefore as an essential component of the <b>collective</b> <b>rights</b> of Ottawa's Franco-Ontarian population. The Government of Ontario criticized the decision as judicial activism, and charged that [...] "The divisional court decision has effectively rewritten the constitution to make [...] 16.1 applicable to Ontario despite the express intention that it apply to New Brunswick alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Charter {{has been}} amended since its enactment. Section 25 was amended in 1983 to {{explicitly}} recognize more rights regarding Aboriginal land claims, and section 16.1 was added in 1993. [...] There {{have also been}} a number of unsuccessful attempts to amend the Charter, including the failed Charlottetown Accord of 1992. The Charlottetown Accord would have specifically required the Charter to be interpreted in a manner respectful of Quebec's distinct society, and would have added further statements to the Constitution Act, 1867 regarding racial and sexual equality and <b>collective</b> <b>rights,</b> and about minority language communities. Though the Accord was negotiated among many interest groups, the resulting provisions were so vague that Trudeau, then out of office, feared they would actually conflict with and undermine the Charter's individual rights. He felt judicial review of the rights might be undermined if courts had to favour the policies of provincial governments, as governments would be given responsibility over linguistic minorities. Trudeau thus played a prominent role in leading the popular opposition to the Accord.|$|E

2500|$|Objectivism {{holds that}} because the {{opportunity}} to use reason without the initiation of force is necessary to achieve moral values, each individual has an inalienable moral right to act as his own judgment directs {{and to keep the}} product of his effort. Peikoff, explaining the basis of rights, stated, [...] "In content, as the founding fathers recognized, there is one fundamental right, which has several major derivatives. The fundamental right is the right to life. Its major derivatives are the right to liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness." [...] "A 'right' is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man's freedom of action in a social context." [...] These rights are specifically understood to be rights to action, not to specific results or objects, and the obligations created by rights are negative in nature: each individual must refrain from violating the rights of others. Objectivists reject alternative notions of rights, such as positive rights, <b>collective</b> <b>rights,</b> or animal rights. Objectivism holds that the only social system which fully recognizes individual rights is capitalism, specifically what Rand described as [...] "full, pure, uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire capitalism." [...] Objectivism regards capitalism as the social system which is most beneficial to the poor, but that this isn't its primary justification. Rather, it is the only moral social system. Objectivism maintains that only societies seeking to establish freedom (or free nations) have a right to self-determination.|$|E
2500|$|While {{rights to}} take {{collective}} action, including strikes, are fundamental to democratic and civilised society, the UK {{has introduced a}} growing menu of <b>collective</b> <b>rights</b> to have a [...] "voice at work" [...] without a need for protest. [...] "Information and consultation" [...] are usually seen as precursors to actual participation rights, through binding votes at work. The economic benefit is that directors or decision-makers who inform and consult staff on important workplace changes (e.g. redundancies) think harder, and see alternatives with fewer costs for the enterprise, taxpayers, and staff. Information and consultation rights have historically derived from collective bargaining models. The Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 sections 181-182 require employers on a union's written request to disclose information, without which collective bargaining could be materially impeded, according to [...] "good industrial relations practice". The Companies Act 2006 section 417-419 also requires disclosure of information in a director's report each financial year on how companies [...] "have regard" [...] to [...] "the interests of the company’s employees" [...] and [...] "business relationships with suppliers" [...] down the supply chain. General consultation rights existed in the UK with collective bargaining since the Whitley Councils from 1918. A general consultation right is now codified in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, article 27. The Court of Justice held this was not directly binding, but specific rules apply in four main contexts: in general work councils, transnational work councils, for collective redundancies, transfers of undertakings, and health and safety.|$|E
