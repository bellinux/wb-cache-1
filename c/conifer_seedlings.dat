40|$|Soil in Field 2 at the USDA Forest Service Nursery, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho was assayed {{six times}} over a 2 - year fallow period for {{potentially}} pathogenic Fusarium and Pythium spp. following incorporation of a corn cover/green manure crop. Populations of potentially disease-antagonistic Trichoderma spp. were also assayed. Soil populations of Fusarium did not decrease over the fallow period and were at sufficient levels {{after two years}} to be of concern from a disease potential standpoint. Populations of Pythium were fairly low throughout the monitoring period. Trichoderma populations remained high, but were probably not sufficient to ameliorate Fusarium disease potential. Fusarium spp. readily colonized soil organic matter particularly roots of the previous <b>conifer</b> <b>seedling</b> crop; these fungi also frequently colonized corn organic debris. Fusarium oxysporum was the major potential pathogen colonizing soil and organic matter.

In the U.S. Pacific Northwest, gopher (pocket gopher) damage to <b>conifer</b> <b>seedlings</b> occurs over thousands of acres, causing significant economic loss for the region.

5000|$|The paper, {{written by}} {{graduate}} student Dan Donato and several colleagues, concerned {{the effects of}} logging {{in the aftermath of}} the 2002 Biscuit Fire, a massive wildfire which burned nearly a half million acres (2,000 km²) in southwestern Oregon. Some forestry scientists, and the Bush administration, proposed that salvage logging—removal of dead trees, many still usable as timber, after a fire—was necessary for fire safety and forest regeneration. [...] Donato et al.’s research provided some evidence contradicting this view. They compared sections of the burn which were burned severely and then salvage-logged to sections which had only been burned. They found the unlogged portions had significantly more <b>conifer</b> <b>seedlings</b> than were found in the logged portions. The paper suggested that soil disturbance and materials left over from the logging process may have disturbed the growth of seedlings. The paper also reported elevated surface fuels in the logged sites, which they concluded elevated the risk of future fire.|$|E
5000|$|Garry oak is {{the only}} native oak species in British Columbia, Washington, and {{northern}} Oregon. In these areas, Garry oak woodlands are seral, or early-successional - they depend on disturbance to avoid being overtaken by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). The disturbance allowing Garry oak to persist {{in an area that}} would otherwise succeed to coniferous forest was primarily fire. Natural wildfires are relatively common in the drier portions of the Pacific Northwest where Garry oak is found, but fire suppression has made such events much less common. In addition, early settlers' records, soil surveys, and tribal histories indicate that deliberate burning was widely practiced by the indigenous people of these areas. Fire perpetuated the grasslands that produced food sources such as camas, chocolate lily, bracken fern, and oak; and that provided grazing and easy hunting for deer and elk. Mature Garry oaks are fire-resistant, and so would not be severely harmed by grass fires of low intensity. Such fires prevented Douglas-fir and most other <b>conifer</b> <b>seedlings</b> from becoming established, allowing bunch grass prairie and Garry oak woodland to persist. Fire also kept oak woodlands on drier soils free of a shrub understory. Wetter oak woodlands historically had a substantial shrub understory, primarily snowberry.|$|E

Mycorrhizal colonisation of root systems {{is an important factor}} in determining seedling vigour, and consequently, survival and growth after their outplanting on agricultural land. Investigations in forest nurseries demonstrated that cultivation systems of Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies seedlings significantly affect the mycorrhizal colonisation of root systems. Bare root cultivation of pine and a containerised polyethylene roll system for spruce provide the most suitable conditions for abundant mycorrhizal colonisation of roots.

Understory vegetation was treated with a broadcast herbicide application prior to thinning, a directed release herbicide application 2 years later, or no treatment beyond harvest disturbance.

Methods: The investigation was a double-blind crossover study, which included a follow-up of 19 planters over a 3 -week period. During Week 1, the 19 planters handled untreated <b>conifer</b> <b>seedlings</b> while they planted imidacloprid- and cypermethrin-treated seedlings during study Week 2 and 3, respectively. Signs and symptoms of acute health effects were documented by a questionnaire, administered by the field staff, during these 3 weeks. Inflammation markers in the nasal mucous membrane were also measured as an objective test. Exposure to cyper-methrin was further assessed by measuring 3 -phenoxybenzoic acid (3 -PBA) in urine. No vali-dated biomarker was available to assess internal exposure to imidacloprid.

40|$|The use of mulches as a {{reforestation}} tool in Oregon and California began {{primarily in}} the late 1950 's. Many types of mulches were tried including sheets of plastic, newspaper, and plywood; various thicknesses of bark, sawdust, sand, and straw; sprayed-on petroleum resin; and even large plastic buckets. Most proved to be ineffective, costly or both. Early trials tended to use small, short-lived materials that aided <b>conifer</b> <b>seedling</b> survival, but not growth.

Five conifers and three hardwoods produced 36 seed crops that ranged from very light to heavy during the 10 -year study period (1964 - 1973). Sound seed for four conifer species combined (not sugar pine) for 10 years amounted to the equivalent of more than 302, 900 seeds per acre and, in general, {{did not differ significantly}} among opening sizes.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Many mycorrhizosphere {{microorganisms}} {{can produce}} plant growth regulating compounds in vitro. Plant growth regulating compounds {{are known to}} mediate root growth and development. In reforestation practices, <b>conifer</b> tree <b>seedling</b> growth and survival are linked to rapid root growth and development after outplanting. Multifactorial experiments were conducted to document variations in <b>conifer</b> <b>seedling</b> growth, survival and endogenous root indole acetic acid (IAA) content as influenced by exogenously applied plant growth regulators and inoculation with ectomycorrhizal fungi capable of differential in vitro IAA and ethylene production. Capacity for in vitro IAA and ethylene production by mycorrhizal fungal isolates was partially correlated to levels of endogenous root IAA and root growth in inoculated seedlings as well as field transplanted nursery-grown seedlings. Although degree of correlation usually varied with fungal isolate as well as conifer species, IAA-mediated changes in root growth and seedling survival could indirectly be attributed to in vitro fungal plant growth regulator production capability. Exogenous application of plant growth regulating substances at different times during seedling growth and development resulted in significant changes in growth, survival and endogenous root IAA content of both experimental seedlings and field transplanted nursery-grown seedlings. Although effects varied with conifer species and stock types, IAA mediated increases in root growth and survival are projected to be cost beneficial. These results are not only indicative {{of the complexity of}} interactions which can occur between symbionts in the mycorrhizosphere but also suggest potential methods for manipulating plant growth regulator mediation of conifer root growth for practical purposes in reforestation...|$|R
