5000|$|<b>Convection</b> (<b>cooking</b> in a hot-air environment, without feeding in {{additional}} steam) - temperatures range from 30 °C (86 °F) to 250 °C (482 °F) or 300 °C (572 °F), {{depending on the}} model.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{tabletop}} <b>convection</b> oven <b>cooking</b> pork. For slower cooking, the gridiron {{here has}} been reversed to place the meat low and far from the main heat source (at {{the top of the}} pot) although near the heat of the glass pot's bottom. Flipping the gridiron would raise the meat, near to the main heat source.|$|R
5000|$|More {{expensive}} {{but more}} universally usable solutions {{are available in}} the form of combi steamers, which combine <b>convection</b> and steam <b>cooking</b> methods into a single device. Instead of water baths, they feature tightly-controlled steam generation systems (not requiring the use of a sealed bag). It is possible to duplicate some effects of sous-vide techniques [...] {{through the use of a}} beer cooler filled with warm water, checked with an accurate thermometer, and ziploc bags with the air removed to package the food for cooking. However, the heat loss involved in this technique makes it unfeasible for long-term (4+ hours) cooking.|$|R
40|$|Longissimus and pectoralis {{muscles were}} removed from 10 steer {{carcasses}} at 4 days postmortem, aged for 14 days at 4 ̊F, then assigned to either ultrasound (ULS) or <b>convection</b> (Conv) <b>cooking</b> to either 144 or 15 8 ̊F internal temperature. Ultrasound cooking was faster (P<. 05), had greater (P<. 05) moisture retention and less (P<. 05) cooking loss, and used less energy (P<. 05). It also produced muscle samples that required less (P<. 05) peak force to shear than those from Conv cooking and resulted in superior (P<. 05) myofibrillar tenderness. No significant interactions occurred among cooking method, muscle, or endpoint temperature. As expected, longissimus (ribeye) muscles cooked faster (P<. 05) and required less (P<. 05) energy and were superior (P<. 05) in instrumentally measured texture and sensory tenderness than pectoralis muscles. Cooking to 158 EF caused greater (P<. 05) moisture and cooking losses, required more (P<. 05) time and energy, and degraded (P<. 05) instrumental textural and sensor y characteristics. Ultrasound offers a new cooking mode that could increase cooking speed, improve energy efficiency and improve some textural characteristics, compared to conventional cooking...|$|R
50|$|The {{heat for}} a tandoor was {{traditionally}} {{generated by a}} charcoal or wood fire, burning within the tandoor itself, thus exposing the food to live-fire, radiant heat cooking, and hot-air, <b>convection</b> <b>cooking,</b> and smoking by the fat and food juices that drip on to the charcoal. Temperatures in a tandoor can approach 480 °C (900 °F), and {{it is common for}} tandoor ovens to remain lit for long periods to maintain the high cooking temperature. The tandoor design is something of a transitional form between a makeshift earth oven and the horizontal-plan masonry oven.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, the sač was a simple, {{primitive}} {{oven for}} baking various foods used by less well-off families {{who could not}} afford a stove in their homes, and the lid itself often doubled as a plate for flatbed baking. Today, the baking appliance is commonly used by Restaurants all over the Balkan Peninsula, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Greece and Turkey, which have adopted this traditional style of cooking, mostly because of its specific flavor enhancing properties, which enable the food to be lightly smoked, additional to aforementioned <b>convection</b> <b>cooking</b> process. The word sač, can also refer to a dish made of meat, vegetables and potatoes, baked in sač oven.|$|E
40|$|Hamburgers {{and chicken}} fillets were cooked in {{convection}} ovens, deep-fried or contact fried and analysed for mutagenic activity using the Ames test. For the three different <b>convection</b> ovens, the <b>cooking</b> parameters studied included {{the presence of}} steam, air velocity, air temperature and holding time. For deep-frying and contact frying, the cooking parameters included cooking temperature and cooking time. In cooked hamburgers, mutagenic activity was only detected in those that had been deep-fried. In chicken fillets, mutagenic activity was detected in samples prepared with all cooking methods, being highest in the deep-fried samples. Factorial analysis indicated that heat transfer {{was the most important}} factor affecting mutagenic activity. High temperature and high air velocity in the convection ovens enhanced mutagenic activity. The presence of steam reduced the mutagenic activity, except when high temperature was used in combination with high air velocity. In chicken fillets, high mutagenic activity correlated to high weight loss during cooking. Pan-fried chicken fillets were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the mutagenic/carcinogenic heterocyclic amines 2 -amino- 3, 8 -dimethylimidazo[4, 5 -f]-quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 -phenylimidazo-[4, 5 -b]-pyridine (PhIP) and the co-mutagenic heterocyclic amine Norharman (9 H-pyrido[3, 4 -b]-indole) were identified. The HPLC fractions were tested for mutagenic activity and, apart from the mutagenic fractions corresponding to MeIQx and PhIP, several mutagenic fractions were detected that did not correspond to known heterocyclic amines...|$|R
50|$|This {{method of}} cooking, known as {{indirect}} (or <b>convection)</b> <b>cooking</b> {{is also used}} by traditional charcoal and wood smokers. That similarity, {{and the fact that}} wood pellets produce smoke that flavors food, resulted in many early adopters turning to pellet grills as an easy-to-use alternative to traditional smokers. Joe Traeger worked to combine the best elements of gas and charcoal grills. The Traeger Grill revolutionized smoking by bringing the ability to slow-cook authentic BBQ to the masses with simplicity and convenience. Like a gas grill, Traeger Grills has a continuous fuel source—once the hopper is loaded with pellets, the auger repeatedly and automatically feeds them into the fire pot at predetermined intervals. The ability to cook at a relatively consistent temperature for hours without tending physical coal or wood fires appealed to BBQers who had become accustomed to tending smokers during long day or overnight cooks.|$|E
40|$|Combined {{microwave}} and <b>convection</b> <b>cooking</b> has gained {{popularity in the}} last 20 years because of more accurate heat control and more efficient use of energy. Combination microwave/convection cooking allows for more rapid cooking, {{but it does not}} have the same even heat distribution as <b>convection</b> <b>cooking.</b> Cooking is a critical stage when preparing meat. The main factors to consider during cooking are: temperature on the surface of meat, internal temperature throughout, and the method of heat transfer. Temperature on the surface and method of heat exchange primarily affect surface color and aroma, whereas internal temperature affects protein structure and flavor as well as aroma. At any temperature above 230 °F, Maillard browning reactions start to occur and give meat its typical brown, caramelized appearance; however, high humidity prevents Maillard browning from occurring and dilutes flavor and odor components. All sensory attributes can, therefore, be significantly influenced by the cooking technique used. Different cooking methods allow for tenderness, flavor development, and color changes, all of which can be either acceptable or unacceptable for consumers. Different cuts of beef are cooked using different cooking methods to ensure that even a low-quality cut of meat can be acceptable for consumption. The objectives of our study were to investigate the differences between <b>convection</b> <b>cooking</b> and a combination of {{microwave and}} <b>convection</b> <b>cooking</b> and endpoint temperatures to observe how these factors affect post-cooking temperature rise, cooking yields, and tenderness...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} predict and {{establish}} cooking times and temperatures of beef to optimize tenderness and cooked yield, {{a computer model}} was developed utilizing heat and mass transfer theories. We cooked beef semitendinosus (eye of round) roasts in a forced-air convection oven using conventional or modeled, multistaged cooking. Conventional cooking was defined as cooking at 325 EF to a core endpoint of 150 EF. The model method was developed using a computer algorithm that predicted heat and moisture (mass) transfer during a three-stage cooking process that included preheating, holding, and finishing. The model was accurate in predicting actual cooking times and temperatures during cooking; temperature profile curves tracked closely between predicted and observed values. Roasts cooked by the modeled cooking regimen had lower Warner-Bratzler shear values than those cooked by conventional <b>convection</b> <b>cooking.</b> Collagen total unaltered fraction was lower (P<. 05; 44 vs. 55 %) and enzyme labile fraction was higher (56 vs. 45 %, P<. 05) in model cooked than in conventionally cooked samples. Cooking yield was not different for the modeled and conventional procedures. These {{results show that the}} modeled multi-stage cooking method was superior to the conventional cooking method...|$|E
