5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been {{cyclical}} ice ages in which glacial sheets periodically covered the higher latitudes of the continents. Ice ages may occur because of changes in ocean circulation and <b>continentality</b> induced by plate tectonics. The Milankovitch theory predicts that glacial periods occur during ice ages because of astronomical factors in combination with climate feedback mechanisms. The primary astronomical drivers are a higher than normal orbital eccentricity, a low axial tilt (or obliquity), and the alignment of summer solstice with the aphelion. Each of these effects occur cyclically. For example, the eccentricity changes over time cycles of about 100,000 and 400,000 years, with the value ranging from less than 0.01 up to 0.05. This is equivalent to a change of the semiminor axis of the planet's orbit from 99.95% of the semimajor axis to 99.88%, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Mount Barker {{is one of}} the 5 {{nominated}} subregions of the Great Southern wine {{region in}} Western Australia, which is Australia's largest wine region with a rectangle 200 kilometres from east to west and over 100 kilometers from north to south. The area has been described as 'the birthplace of the Great Southern wine region' and has won numerous awards for a variety of wines. Situated {{as it is in the}} middle of the Great Southern, the continental aspects of the climate make this quintessential country for Riesling and Shiraz. While, as with the rest of the region, rainfall is winter-spring dominant, late vintage rains can create problems. Mount Barker's <b>continentality</b> also means greater diurnal temperature fluctuations and the occasional spring frost. The Plantagenet Plateau, with Mount Barker its centre point, is marked by its marri soils, lateritic gravelly/sandy loams coming directly from granite rock protusions.

2500|$|Avalanches {{can only}} {{occur in a}} {{standing}} snowpack. Typically winter seasons at high latitudes, high altitudes, or both, have weather that is sufficiently unsettled, and cold enough for precipitated snow to accumulate into a seasonal snowpack. <b>Continentality,</b> through its potentiating influence on the meteorological extremes experienced by snowpacks, {{is an important factor}} in the evolution of instabilities, and consequential occurrence of avalanches. Conversely, proximity to coastal environments moderates the meteorological extremes experienced by snowpacks, and results in a faster stabilization of the snowpack after storm cycles. [...] The evolution of the snowpack is critically sensitive to small variations within the narrow range of meteorological conditions that allow for the accumulation of snow into a snowpack. Among the critical factors controlling snowpack evolution are: heating by the sun, radiational cooling, vertical temperature gradients in standing snow, snowfall amounts, and snow types. Generally, mild winter weather will promote the settlement and stabilization of the snowpack; and conversely very cold, windy, or hot weather will weaken the snowpack.|$|E

50|$|Heinz Ellenberg (August 1, 1913 in Harburg (Elbe) - May 2, 1997 in Göttingen) was a German biologist, {{botanist}} and ecologist.

50|$|<b>Continentality</b> - Away {{from the}} moderating {{influence}} of the ocean, seasonal temperature variation is more extreme and freeze-thaw goes deeper.

50|$|The {{region is}} part of the Southern Tablelands about 150 km inland from the Pacific Ocean. The region {{receives}} moderate, but variable rainfall, and vineyards require supplemental irrigation in most years. Typical vineyard elevations range between 500 and 900 m, and the inland location result in relatively high <b>continentality,</b> possibly explaining the affinity for leading varieties Shiraz and Riesling. Promising recent results from Tempranillo may be explained by the strong homoclime to Ribera del Duero.|$|E
50|$|The {{climate of}} the island is {{variable}} from area to area, due to several factors including the extension in latitude and the elevation. It can be classified in two different macrobioclimates (Mediterranean pluviseasonal oceanic and Temperate oceanic), one macrobioclimatic variant, called Submediterranean, and four classes of <b>continentality</b> (from weak semihyperoceanic to weak semicontinental), eight thermotypic horizons (from lower thermomediterranean to upper supratemperate) and seven ombrotypic horizons (from lower dry to lower hyperhumid), resulting in a combination of 43 different isobioclimates.|$|E

A substantial advance on a comparable scale to place a local flora on gradients are the climatic profiles of the French SOPHY online database.|$|E
50|$|Ice cap climates are {{not nearly}} as common on land in the extreme {{northern}} latitudes as in Antarctica. This is because the Arctic Ocean moderates the temperatures of the surrounding land, making the extreme cold seen in Antarctica impossible. In fact, the coldest winters in the northern hemisphere are in subarctic climates in Siberia, such as Verkhoyansk, which are much farther inland and lack the ocean's moderating effect. This same lack of moderating oceanic effect, coupled with the extreme <b>continentality</b> of the Russian interior allows for very warm summers in the same areas that experience harsh winters.|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} factors influencing the climate of Hungary are its distance from the Atlantic and the prevailing westerly winds. The continental character of the Hungarian climate {{is far from being}} as extreme as in Eastern Europe. The degree of <b>continentality</b> can be illustrated by the following example: if the Atlantic coast is taken as zero and Verkhoyansk in Siberia as 100, then Sopron (Western Hungary), Putnok (Northern Hungary) and Tótkomlós (South-Eastern Hungary), would be 27.3, 30.4 and 34, respectively. The depressions of the temperate zone follow {{in the path of the}} westerly winds and bring heavy rains to the country.|$|E
50|$|Frankland River {{is one of}} {{the five}} subregions of the Great Southern in Western Australia. It is {{situated}} in the northwestern corner of the region, its western boundary touching the eastern side of Manjimup. It is the most northerly, inland subregion of Great Southern, still Mediterranean in terms of dominant winter-spring rainfall, but with greater <b>continentality.</b> The soils are chiefly derived from lateric gravelly sandy loams or sandy loams derived from granite or gneissic rocks, and so are typically rich, red in color and of uniform depth with some areas carrying marri and karri loams. The climatic influences for the area favor medium-bodied, Bordeaux style red varieties, and with the excellent adaptation of slightly earlier-maturing Shiraz.|$|E
50|$|The {{climate is}} {{characterized}} by moderate <b>continentality.</b> According to the data of the Belotserkovsky meteorological station, the average long-term annual air temperature is 6.9 °C.The average rainfall is 498 mm, about 80% of which falls {{in the form of}} rain. The minimum temperature is -32.4 °C in January, the maximum is +38 °C in June. Ground temperature 0 °C and below is observed to a depth of 40 cm, from December to March.

50|$|Krasnoyarsk {{experiences}} a continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with long and very cold winters and short but warm summers. Its climate in July {{and during the}} winter {{is very similar to}} that of Fort McMurray and Winnipeg, Canada, the latter of which is a good deal further south geographically. Compared to Thompson, Manitoba, or Labrador City at a similar latitudes, Krasnoyarsk's winters are relatively mild. Compared to European cities on a similar latitude, Krasnoyarsk has much warmer summers, but much colder and longer winters (for example, Aberdeen, Scotland). The summer is also on average warmer than similar inland latitudes of Scandinavia, owing to Siberia's greater <b>continentality.</b> Very few major cities on earth have higher differentials between summer and winter temperatures than Krasnoyarsk.|$|E
50|$|At an {{elevation}} of 856 m, the city of Burgos experiences the continental-influenced Mediterranean climate (Kŏppen Cfb). Burgos' climate features very cool and windy winters due to altitude and an inland location. Winters always include snow and temperatures below freezing. Burgos' <b>continentality</b> is caused by two principal factors: distance from the sea and higher altitude. Temperature ranges can be extreme and Burgos is drier than Spain's coastal regions, although there is year-round precipitation. Average annual precipitation is 546 mm and the average annual relative humidity is 72%. In winter, temperatures very often (almost every day) drop below freezing, often reaching temperatures as low as , and snowfalls are common, while the summer months see average high temperatures of 27.5 C. The lowest recorded temperature in Burgos was -21 C on 20 January 1885. The highest recorded temperature was 39 C on 13 August 1987.|$|E

50|$|Increased <b>continentality</b> {{resulted}} in reduced and less predictable rainfall limiting {{the availability of}} plants necessary for energy and nutrition. Axelrod and Slaughter have suggested that this change in rainfall restricted {{the amount of time}} favorable for reproduction. This could disproportionately harm large animals, since they have longer, more inflexible mating periods, and so may have produced young at unfavorable seasons (i.e., when sufficient food, water, or shelter was unavailable because of shifts in the growing season). In contrast, small mammals, with their shorter life cycles, shorter reproductive cycles, and shorter gestation periods, could have adjusted to the increased unpredictability of the climate, both as individuals and as species which allowed them to synchronize their reproductive efforts with conditions favorable for offspring survival. If so, smaller mammals would have lost fewer offspring and would have been better able to repeat the reproductive effort when circumstances once more favored offspring survival.|$|E
50|$|Wine {{regions with}} {{continental}} climates are characterised {{by the very}} marked seasonal changes that occur throughout the growing season, with hot temperatures during the summer season and winters cold enough for periodic ice and snow. This is generally described as having {{a high degree of}} <b>continentality.</b> Regions with this type of climate are often found inland on continents without a significant body of water, such as an inland sea, that can moderate their temperatures. Often during the growing season, continental climates will have wide diurnal temperature variations with very warm temperatures during the day that drop drastically at night. During the winter and early spring months, frost and hail can be viticultural hazards. Depending on the particular macroclimate of the region, irrigation may be needed to supplement seasonal rainfall. These many climatic influences contribute to the wide vintage variation that is often typical of continental climates such as Burgundy.|$|E

It is the most northerly, inland subregion of Great Southern, still Mediterranean in terms of dominant winter-spring rainfall, but with greater <b>continentality,</b> thus favoring Riesling, shiraz and cabernet sauvignon. A unique feature is a sea breeze which finds its way inland and cools the late afternoon temperature by about 2C. Total rainfall decreases from west to east, and salinity in the soil and surface water makes irrigation difficult. The answer is a complex and extensive system of very long collection channels and drains on slopes, plus holding dams and long-distance pumping. The gently rolling hill country is catchment for the Frankland, Gordon, Kent and Tone rivers. The soils are chiefly derived from granite or gneiss outcrops, and so are typically rich, red in color and of uniform depth.

50|$|Ribbed bog moss {{occurs in}} arctic, subarctic, boreal, and subboreal zones with cold meso-thermal, oceanic, continental, or cold-humid climates. It {{is more common}} in arctic, subarctic, and boreal than subboreal zones. A survey of bryophytes on peatlands across Alberta's Mackenzie River basin found optimal ribbed bog moss growth {{occurred}} on sites with annual temperatures ranging from 20 to 32 °F (-4 to 0 °C). In interior arctic, subarctic, and boreal zones, climate is strongly continental in the west, becoming more humid to the east. Climate shift from continental to humid generally occurs near Hudson Bay and Lake Superior. In a study of moss habitats across British Columbia, Alberta, and Manitoba, ribbed bog moss was an indicator species for <b>continentality</b> of climate: it was the only moss common to all continental peatlands surveyed. On sites from coastal British Columbia to central Alberta, ribbed bog moss was most common on subcontinental sites (intermediate between coastal and continental climates). Ribbed bog moss was intermediate on gradients ranking breadth of moss habitat niches. Climate factors evaluated included length of growing season, amount of precipitation during the growing season, temperature, and aridity. Feather mosses (Hylocomiaceae) and sphagnum mosses generally had wider niches and dominated more sites than ribbed bog moss. Ribbed bog moss's rarity on all but cold sites in the lower 48 states suggests that ribbed bog moss does not tolerate long periods of warm weather. In a geothermal meadow on Queen Charlotte Island, British Columbia, ribbed bog moss was absent from sites where nearby thermal pools raised local soil temperatures above 86 °F (30 °C).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{regeneration}} silviculture, [...] "spring", [...] "summer", etc. lack precise meaning. Typically, the spring planting season begins as soon as lifting becomes possible in the nursery, and ends with {{the completion of the}} program. At this time, planting stock is physiologically attuned to the oncoming growing season, and the outplant has the whole of that season in which to establish its root system before it is challenged by any frost heaving. In practice, ideals are seldom attained. That stock is normally dormant when spring-planted is a widespread fallacy. Active growth is commonly obvious at the time of planting, but in any case the metabolic activity increases in planting stock before the tops give visible expression to this. The difficulty of obtaining, in quantity, spring-lifted stock in dormant condition increases with increasing <b>continentality</b> of climate. In many areas, the period of spring-like weather is unreliable and often short. As well, the soil moisture advantage claimed for spring planting is also insecurely founded. Soils that are sandy or gravelly, and shallow soils of any texture are highly dependent on current weather due to their limited available water capacities. Nor will a plentiful supply of soil moisture benefit an outplant whose roots are enveloped in anaerobic and/or cold soil, and mortality of trees outplanted into soil colder than about 6 °C may be excessive. Flushing increases the vulnerability of planting stock to both physiological stress (because of increased water requirements and reduced root growth capacity) and mechanical damage, which probably accounts for the commonly asserted superiority of early spring over late spring planting.|$|E
