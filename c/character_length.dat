IBM cards were 80 <b>characters</b> in <b>length.</b> UNIVAC cards were 90 <b>characters</b> in <b>length.</b> A punched card typically held multiple data fields, some numeric, some alphabetic.

5000|$|Transmitting and {{receiving}} UARTs must be {{set for the}} same bit speed, <b>character</b> <b>length,</b> parity, and stop bits for proper operation. The receiving UART may detect some mismatched settings and set a [...] "framing error" [...] flag bit for the host system; in exceptional cases the receiving UART will produce an erratic stream of mutilated characters and transfer them to the host system.|$|E
50|$|All {{operations}} of the UART hardware are controlled by a clock signal which runs at a multiple of the data rate, typically 8 times the bit rate. The receiver tests {{the state of the}} incoming signal on each clock pulse, looking for the beginning of the start bit. If the apparent start bit lasts at least one-half of the bit time, it is valid and signals {{the start of a new}} character. If not, it is considered a spurious pulse and is ignored. After waiting a further bit time, the state of the line is again sampled and the resulting level clocked into a shift register. After the required number of bit periods for the <b>character</b> <b>length</b> (5 to 8 bits, typically) have elapsed, the contents of the shift register are made available (in parallel fashion) to the receiving system. The UART will set a flag indicating new data is available, and may also generate a processor interrupt to request that the host processor transfers the received data.|$|E
5000|$|WPS {{currently}} has a severe vulnerability {{in which the}} 8 pin numbered (0-9) passwords being used can easily be split into two halves, this means that each half can be brute-forced individually and so the possible combinations are greatly lessened (10^4 + 10^4, as opposed to 10^8). This vulnerability has been addressed by most manufacturers these days by using a lock down mechanism where the router will automatically lock its WPS {{after a number of}} failed pin attempts (it can takea number of hours before the router will automatically unlock, some even have to be rebooted which can make WPSattacks completely obsolete) Without a lock down feature, a WPA2 router with WPS enabled can easily be cracked in 5 hours using abrute force WPS attack. SSID's are used in routers not only to identify them within the mass of 2.4, 3.6, 5 and 60 GHz frequencies which are currently flying around our cities and towns but are also used as a [...] "seed" [...] for the routerspassword hashes. Standard and popular SSID's such as [...] "Netgear" [...] can be brute forced through the use of rainbow tables,however, {{it should be noted that}} the use of a salt greatly improves security against rainbow tables. The most popularmethod of WPA and WPA2 cracking is through obtaining what's known as a [...] "4 way handshake". when a device is connecting with a networkthere is a 4-stage authorization process referred to as a 4 way handshake. When a wireless device undergoes this processthis handshake is sent through the air and can easily be monitored and saved by an external system. The handshakewill be encrypted by the routers password, this means that as opposed to communicating with the router directly (which can be quite slow), the cracker can attempt to brute force the handshake itself using dictionary attacks. A device that is connected directly with the router will still undergo this very process, however, the handshake will be sent through theconnected wire as opposed to the air so it cannot be intercepted. If a 4 way handshake has already been intercepted, itdoes not mean that the cracker will be granted immediate access however. If the password used contains at least 12 characters consisting of both random upper and lower case letters and numbers that do not spell a word, name or have any pattern then the password will be essentially uncrackable. Just to give an example of this lets just take the minimum of 8 characters for WPA2 and suppose we take upper case and lower case letters, digits from 0-9 and a small selection of symbols, we can avail of a hefty choice of 64 characters. In an 8 <b>character</b> <b>length</b> password this is a grand total of 64^8 possible combinations. Taking a single machine that could attempt 500 passwords per second, this gives us just about 17,900 years to attempt every possible combination. Not even to mention the amount of space necessary to store each combination in a dictionary.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a {{research on the}} attenuation of cyclic stress amplitude and the variation of microstructure under the action of ultrasonic vibration in crack propagation for Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 composite nano-ceramics. To interpret this phenomenon, the nonlocal theory is introduced to establish the constitutive model under the ultrasonic condition based on the specified 2 D attenuating function. The mechanics behavior of the ceramics under the action of ultrasonic vibration is analyzed according {{to the relationship between}} the internal <b>character</b> <b>length</b> and the external <b>character</b> <b>length</b> (i. e. ultrasonic wave length). In addition, the variation law of the cyclic stress amplitude and microstructure with different ultrasonic frequencies is also studied in this paper. It is shown that the cyclic stress amplitude is attenuated under the action of ultrasonic vibration, and this attenuation phenomenon becomes more and more evident by increasing the ultrasonic frequency. The results of experiment are in accordance with the theoretical conclusions drawn from the nonlocal theory, which verifies that the action of ultrasonic vibration can actually accelerate the ceramic crack propagation...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} substitution-only {{approach}} to sentence compression which “tightens ” a sentence by reducing its <b>character</b> <b>length.</b> Replacing phrases with shorter paraphrases yields paraphrastic compressions {{as short as}} 60 % of the original length. In support of this task, we introduce a novel technique for re-ranking paraphrases extracted from bilingual corpora. At high compression rates 1 paraphrastic compressions outperform a state-of-the-art deletion model in an oracle experiment. For further compression, deleting from oracle paraphrastic compressions preserves more meaning than deletion alone. In either setting, paraphrastic compression shows promise for surpassing deletion-only methods. ...|$|E

In our investigations, we used homozygous male and female doubled haploid plants obtained from in vitro anther culture, the all-male F 1 progeny and male individuals from subsequent backcrosses. The results showed that: (1) the <b>character</b> <b>length</b> of the style is genetically inherited and involves at least two genes, the influence of the environment being quite negligible; (2) in male pistils provided with style and stigmatic papillae, the pollination and growth of the pollen tubes up to the ovules do actually occur as a rule, the only barrier to fertilization being the absence of normal embryo sacs inside the ovules; (3) the <b>character</b> <b>length</b> of the style is a very reliable marker of the trend towards hermaphroditism in Asparagus, since a correlation always exist between length of the style, size of the ovary, tendency to self-pollination, vascularization and rate of development of the ovules inside the male ovaries. On the whole, most of our observations, together with the high inbreeding depression observed when occasional andromonoecious plants are selfed, are consistent with the hypothesis of the origin of dioecy in Asparagus from hermaphroditism via the gynodioecy pathway...|$|E

To create the corpus, we propose an algorithm based on Gale and Church’s sentence alignment algorithm(1993). However, our algorithm not only relies on <b>character</b> <b>length</b> information, but also uses subtitle-timing information, which is encoded in the subtitle files. Timing is highly correlated between subtitles in different versions (for the same movie), since subtitles that match should be displayed at the same time. However, the absolute time values can’t be used for alignment, since the timing is usually specified by frame numbers and not by real time, and converting it to real time values is not always possible, hence we use normalized subtitle duration instead. This results in {{a significant reduction in}} the alignment error rate. 1...|$|E
