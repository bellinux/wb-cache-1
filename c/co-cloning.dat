40|$|A novel {{strategy}} {{for separation of}} co-cloned YACs was developed. For this, yeast cells were grown under non-selective conditions to allow the mitotic loss of multiple YACs. Yeast colonies of different size appear on ‘drop-out ’ selection plates with small clones con-sistently containing a single-copy YAC. Different auxo-trophic marker genes {{can be used to}} separate co-cloned YACs or reduce their copy number, which is essential for most YAC-modification procedures. Multiple yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) can co-exist in the same yeast cell due to <b>co-cloning</b> or amplification of an originally single-copy YAC. YAC amplification can be explained by inefficient transcription from the promoter of the TRP 1 gene in pYAC vectors, which in Trp–Ura – ‘drop-out ’ medium can lead t...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{introduce}} {{and investigate}} {{the concept of}} frozen partial <b>co-clones.</b> Our main motivation for studying frozen partial <b>co-clones</b> {{is that they have}} important applications in complexity analysis of constraints. The frozen partial co- clones lie between the <b>co-clones</b> and partial <b>co-clones</b> {{in the sense that the}} partial <b>co-clone</b> lattice is a refinement of the frozen partial <b>co-clone</b> lattice, which in turn is a refinement of the <b>co-clone</b> lattice. We concentrate on the Boolean domain and determine large parts of the frozen partial <b>co-clone</b> lattice...|$|R
40|$|Two well-studied closure {{operators}} for {{relations are}} based on existentially quantified conjunctive formulas, primitive positive (p. p.) definitions, and primitive positive formulas without existential quantification, quantifier-free primitive positive definitions (q. f. p. p.) definitions. Sets of relations closed under p. p. definitions are known as <b>co-clones</b> and sets of relations closed under q. f. p. p. definitions as weak partial <b>co-clones.</b> The latter do however have limited expressivity, and the corresponding lattice of strong partial clones is of uncountably infinite cardinality even for the Boolean domain. Hence, {{it is reasonable to}} consider the expressiveness of p. p. definitions where {{only a small number of}} existentially quantified variables are allowed. In this article, we consider p. p. definitions allowing only polynomially many existentially quantified variables, and say that a <b>co-clone</b> closed under such definitions is polynomially closed, and otherwise superpolynomially closed. We investigate properties of polynomially closed <b>co-clones</b> and prove that if the corresponding clone contains a k-ary near-unanimity operation for k amp;gt;= 3, then the <b>co-clone</b> is polynomially closed, and if the clone does not contain a k-edge operation for any k amp;gt;= 2, then the <b>co-clone</b> is superpolynomially closed. For the Boolean domain we strengthen these results and prove a complete dichotomy theorem separating polynomially closed <b>co-clones</b> from superpolynomially closed <b>co-clones.</b> Using these results, we then proceed to investigate properties of strong partial clones corresponding to superpolynomially closed <b>co-clones.</b> We prove that if Gamma is a finite set of relations over an arbitrary finite domain such that the clone corresponding to Gamma is essentially unary, then the strong partial clone corresponding to Gamma is of infinite order and cannot be generated by a finite set of partial functions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe give a {{quadratic}} algorithm for {{the following}} structure identification problem: given a Boolean relation R and a finite set S of Boolean relations, can the relation R be expressed as a conjunctive query over the relations in the set S? Our algorithm is derived by first introducing {{the concept of a}} plain basis for a <b>co-clone</b> and then identifying natural plain bases for every <b>co-clone</b> in Post's lattice. In the process, we also give a quadratic algorithm for the problem of finding the smallest <b>co-clone</b> containing a Boolean relation...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} a plain basis for a <b>co-clone</b> in Post’s lattice. Such a basis is a set of relations B such that every constraint C over a relation in the <b>co-clone</b> is logically equivalent to a conjunction of equalities and constraints over B and the same variables as C; this differs from the usual notion of a basis in that existential quantification of auxiliary variables is not allowed. We give such a basis for every <b>co-clone</b> and in particular for those in the infinite part of the lattice; it turns out that most of these bases correspond to sets of propositional clauses, thus providing a strong link between classes of formulas defined for CSP and CNF representations. We then show that a so-called preferred representation of a relation over one of its bases can be computed efficiently, as well as the minimal <b>co-clone</b> including a given relation, which solves some open structure identification problem as well as the open expressibility problem from database theory...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{scientists}} are {{curious about the}} complexity relationship between different kinds of NP-complete SAT problems. In {{order to understand the}} complexity relationship between SAT problems, we decided to correspond SAT problems to a kind of algebra called partial <b>co-clones.</b> Each SAT problem can be represented by a set of Boolean relations. Partial <b>co-clones</b> are Boolean relations enumerated under quantifier-free primitive positive definition. If SAT(R 2) is included in SAT(R 1) ’s partial <b>co-clones,</b> SAT(R 1) cannot be solved faster than SAT(R 2). We used this kind of relationship to get a partial order of the worst-case time complexity of SAT problems. Partial <b>co-clones</b> are complicated, and we do not really understand the structure of partial <b>co-clones.</b> Therefore, {{it would have been easier}} to explore parts of their structures automatically with the help of current computers. We strived to develop a scalable efficient program exploiting parallel computers. We started with exploring sequential optimization methods including data structure design, Depth First Search combination, Inverse SAT, and tried to partition the searching process equally to each computing node. We proposed an easy but efficient, scalable implementation that could handle problem size less than O(280) with memory cost equal to O(n). Given enough computing nodes, we could achieve performance close to linear speedup...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In our ISMVL 2012 {{paper we}} {{introduced}} {{the notion of}} max-co-clone {{as a set of}} relations closed under a new type of quantication, max-quantication. This new concept was motivated by its connections to approximation complexity of count-ing constraint satisfaction problems. In this paper we go beyond scattered examples of max-co-clones and describe all max-co-clones on a 2 -elements set (Boolean max-co-clones). It turns out that there are innitely many Boolean max-co-clones and that all of them are regular <b>co-clones,</b> although it is not true for larger sets. Also there are many usual <b>co-clones</b> that are not closed under max-quantication, and therefore are not max-co-clones. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe give a trichotomy theorem for the {{complexity}} of approximately {{counting the number of}} satisfying assignments of a Boolean CSP instance. Such problems are parameterised by a constraint language specifying the relations that may be used in constraints. If every relation in the constraint language is affine then the number of satisfying assignments can be exactly counted in polynomial time. Otherwise, if every relation in the constraint language is in the <b>co-clone</b> IM 2 from Post's lattice, then the problem of counting satisfying assignments is complete with respect to approximation-preserving reductions for {{the complexity}} class #RHΠ 1. This means that the problem of approximately counting satisfying assignments of such a CSP instance is equivalent in complexity to several other known counting problems, including the problem of approximately counting the number of independent sets in a bipartite graph. For every other fixed constraint language, the problem is complete for #P with respect to approximation-preserving reductions, meaning that there is no fully polynomial randomised approximation scheme for counting satisfying assignments unless NP=RP...|$|R
40|$|Two Yeast Artificial Chromosomes (YACs) were {{isolated}} {{each with a}} full-length copy of the human gene that encodes the trifunctional protein containing phosphoribosylglycinamide synthetase (GARS), phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (GART) and phosphoribosylaminoimidazole synthetase (AIRS). The YACs were characterized by restriction mapping and by in situ hybridization of cosmid subclones containing the YAC ends to human metaphase chromosomes. One of the YACs contains <b>co-cloned</b> non-contiguous DNA whereas the other {{appears to have a}} single 600 kbp insert from 21 q 22. 1, the location of the GART gene. A restriction map of the gene was obtained from two cosmid subclones which together span the 40 kb gene. The gene is functional when YAC DNA is transferred into GARS- or GARS-and-AIRS-deficient Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. The gene transfer was carried out both by lipofection using purified yeast DNA and by fusion between yeast spheroplasts and the hamster cells. Restriction analysis of DNA from cell lines whose purine auxotrophy was complemented by the YAC showed that with either method a complete and unrearranged copy of the gene can be transferred. The majority of the fusion cell lines appear to contain at least 80 % of the YAC...|$|R
