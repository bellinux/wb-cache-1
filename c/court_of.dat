5|$|English law is {{regarded}} as a common law system, with no major codification of the law, and legal precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive.The court system is headed by the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> the United Kingdom which is the highest <b>court</b> <b>of</b> appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The Senior Courts of England and Wales is the highest <b>court</b> <b>of</b> first instance as well as an appellate court. The three divisions are the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Appeal; the High <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Justice and the Crown Court. Minor cases are heard by the Magistrates' Courts or the County Court. In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single jurisdiction of England and Wales.|$|E

5|$|For {{almost all}} of their history, Serjeants at Law and King's Serjeants were the only advocates given rights of {{audience}} in the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Common Pleas. Until the 17th century they were also first {{in the order of}} precedence in the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> King's Bench and <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Chancery, which gave them priority in motions before the court. Serjeants also had the privilege of being immune from most normal forms of lawsuit – they could only be sued by a writ from the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Chancery. It was held as an extension of this that servants of Serjeants could only be sued in the Common Pleas. As part of the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties, such as levying fines. In exchange for these privileges, Serjeants were expected to fulfil certain duties; firstly, that they represent anybody who asked regardless of their ability to pay, and secondly that, due to the small number of judges, they serve as deputy judges to hear cases when there was no judge available.|$|E

5|$|From its foundation, the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Chancery could {{administer}} estates, {{due to its}} {{jurisdiction over}} trusts. While the main burden in the 16th century fell on the ecclesiastical courts, their powers over administrators and executors was limited, regularly necessitating the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Chancery's involvement. Before the Statute of Wills, many people used feoffees to dispose of their land, something that fell {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Lord Chancellor anyway. In addition, in relation to the discovery and accounting of assets, the process used by the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Chancery was far superior to the ecclesiastical one; as a result, the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Chancery was regularly used by beneficiaries. The common law courts also had jurisdiction over some estates matters, but their remedies for problems were far more limited.|$|E

5|$|If the High Court {{refuses to}} hear an appeal, the case cannot proceed further; similarly, with one exception, once the High Court has heard a case, no {{decision}} may be reviewed by the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Appeal. The one exception is laid out in Section 1(7), and provides that leave to appeal is only valid if either the High Court or <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Appeal certifies it as such, and the High Court confirms that the case concerns a point of law which merits consideration. In National Westminster Bank Plc v Arthur Young McClelland Moores & Co (No.1), the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Appeal confirmed that, once the High Court {{has decided not to}} allow an appeal, the registrar of the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Appeal cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 {{the idea}} was resurrected– again by Palmer, who was now Lord Selborne and the new Lord Chancellor– as the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Judicature bill. While still cautious, Selborne's bill was far more {{structured}} than Hatherley's, and contained more detail on {{what was to be}} done. Rather than fusing the common law and equity, which he saw as impracticable since it would destroy the idea of trusts, he decided to fuse the courts and the procedure. The final draft provided that all of the existing superior courts would be fused into one court consisting of two levels; one of first instance, one appellate. The <b>court</b> <b>of</b> first instance, {{to be known as the}} High <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Justice, would be subdivided into several divisions based on the old superior courts, one of which, the Chancery Division, would deal with equity cases. All jurisdiction of the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Chancery was to be transferred to the Chancery Division; Section 25 of the Act provided that, where there was conflict between the common law and equity, the latter would prevail. An appeal from each division went to the appellate level, the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Appeal of England and Wales. These provisions were brought into effect after amendment with the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Judicature Act 1875, and the <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Chancery ceased to exist. The Master of the Rolls was transferred to the new <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Appeal, the Lord Chancellor retained his other judicial and political roles, and the position of Vice-Chancellor ceased to exist, replaced by ordinary judges. The Chancery Division remains to this day part of the High <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> Justice of England and Wales.|$|E
