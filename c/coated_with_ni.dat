40|$|Recently the rare-earth magnet NdFeB {{is applied}} to a magnet motor of {{electric}} vehicles. The rise of temperature due to eddy current loss in the PM (Permanent Magnet) leads to serious deterioration of the PM, especially in high speed operation. In general NdFeB is <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>Ni</b> (Nickel) or Al (Aluminum) {{in order to prevent}} from corrosion and destruction. PM coating is very thin, but conductivity of coating material is much larger than that of PM, and Ni is the magnetic material. Consequently, PM coating has an influence on the eddy currents in PM.

40|$|The Mg-Ni {{metastable}} alloys (with amorphous or nanocrystalline structures) {{are promising}} candidates for anode application in nickel-metal hydride rechargeable batteries {{due to its}} large hydrogen absorbing capacity, low weight, availability, and relative low price.

40|$|Si {{nanowires}} <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>Ni</b> showed interesting structural transformation {{behaviors as}} observed by in situ transmission electron microscopy. Owing {{to the presence}} of the native oxide on Si nanowire surfaces, the Ni thin shells initially segregated into nanosized droplets on the oxide surfaces. The native oxide shells protected the Si cores from reacting with Ni at temperatures below 1350 °C. Ni started the reaction with Si nanowires preferentially at the defects or bending regions of the nanowires. Because the reaction temperature was sufficiently high, the structural transformation was extremely fast and completed within 0. 1 s. The resulting nanowires were single crystalline NiSi 2, the most desirable Ni silicide structure for potential applications.

40|$|Abstract. Bottom ash {{contains}} many ferrous materials (e. g. ferrous metals, Fe 3 O 4, Fe 2 O 3, FeS). In addition, ferrous metals include the heavy metals, as Ni and Cr have a chemical attraction to iron, with Cu used to <b>coat</b> <b>with</b> <b>Ni</b> and Cr metals for polishing or to prevent corrosion. For ferrous metals, {{the formation of}} a Fe 3 O 4 -Fe 2 O 3 double layer (similar to pure Fe) was found during air-annealing in an incinerator (1000 C). A strong thermal shock, such as that which takes place during water-cooling of bottom ash, leads to the breakdown of this oxidation layer, facilitating the degradation of ferrous metals and the formation of corrosion products. Therefore, Fe-ion (heavy metal) oxides can be formed on ferrous metals, and magnetic separation can separate it from bottom ash.

40|$|Abstract Tungsten carbide with nickel (WC-Ni) is {{generally}} used in applications in which high wear and corrosion resistance are required. In most cases, WC {{is mixed with}} Ni powder through a powder-processing route. In the present study, an electroless deposition technique was employed in order to prepare Ni coated WC particles prior to forming specimens by powder injection moulding method. The starting WC powders were subjected to surface activation followed by electroless Ni coating. The effects {{of a variety of}} processing parameters, including coating time and powder to electrolyte content ratio, were examined. The characteristics of the prepared powders were assessed by scanning electron microscopy and laser particle size analysis. It has been found that the fabrication of WC powder <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>Ni</b> can be achieved through the electroless deposition technique. The amount of Ni introduced to the WC particles can be controlled by the powder to electrolyte content ratio and the deposition duration.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the use of}} boron-doped {{diamond and}} Au (111) as {{electrode}} materials with special physical and electrochemical properties was investigated {{in a number of}} electrochemical and photoelectrochemical applications. The surface chemistry of the aforementioned electrodes was modified utilising such strategies as electrochemical and hydrogen plasma treatment as well as coating treatment. Extended attention was paid to metal alloys and/or core-shell metal nanostructures. The modified surface of the diamond and Au (111) electrodes was studied using a wide spectrum of techniques. The electrochemical activity of these materials was investigated in order firstly to expand the knowledge of diamond electrochemistry and secondly to establish an understanding of how the electrochemical modification with metal nanoparticles of core-shell structure impacts their electrochemical performance. In the first study, the nanostructuring strategies of boron-doped diamond surface with Pt-Cu and Cu nanoparticles were developed for two different applications. Pt-Cu modified diamond electrode was explored for methanol oxidation, which is of relevance to the direct methanol fuel cell. The motivation of this work was to understand how these core-shell structures on diamond compare to similar structures on other forms of carbon. The second objective was the development of a simple Cu-modified diamond electrode that {{can be used as a}} sensitive non-enzymatic amperometric glucose sensor. The second work involves two fundamental electrochemical studies. The first one reports the overpotential growth of Pd metallic nanoparticles on Au (111). For the first time, this study contradicts the classical theories for electrochemical nucleation and growth which proceed only by the fresh reduction of ions. It demonstrates that electrochemical nucleation and growth at the early stages is overpotential dependent and in fact proceed also by the aggregation of small clusters through surface diffusion when deposited at relatively higher overpotentials. The second study reports the influence of two dissimilar surface terminations of diamond: hydrophobic H-terminated and hydrophilic O-terminated. The latter work provides a useful insight of how the chemical terminations of diamond with electrodeposited Pd nanoparticles impact their overall electrochemical performance. The third project extends the discussion on the study of the diamond electrodes modified with core-shell metal nanoparticles along with two different chemical terminations. In this work, a H-terminated diamond electrode was modified with Pd-Sn nanoparticles and an O-terminated diamond electrode was electrochemically modified with Pd-Ni nanoparticles. The enhanced electrodesâ performance with regard to the ethanol electrooxidation reaction was demonstrated. The fourth study reports on the development of a novel photocatalyst comprised of Cu 2 O nanoparticles <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>Ni</b> supported on boron-doped diamond electrodes, of relevance to water splitting and CO 2 reduction reactions. Similarly to the previous works, an insight is provided on how a co-catalyst contributes not only to the protection of semiconductor materials from self-photo-corrosion issues in aqueous solutions, but also to improved stability and enhanced photoelectrochemical performance.

40|$|The present Ph. D. thesis {{deals with}} the {{hydrogen}} production via a novel process involving a biogas autothermal reforming (ATR) unit with {{the adoption of a}} catalytic wall-flow filter located downstream from the ATR processor to effectively filter and in-situ gasify the carbon emissions eventually generated. This work was aimed to produce 50 Nm 3 /h of green hydrogen from the ATR of a model biogas (60 : 40 Vol ratio) by using catalytic structured supports. Moreover, a solution for the eventual carbon formation during the biogas ATR was addressed. A nanostructured delafossite catalyst to ensure the gasification of soot in absence of O 2 was synthesized. In addition, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and a techno-economic analysis for the hydrogen production from biogas were also carried out. Concerning the identification of the suitable support structure to improve the coupling of exothermic and endothermic reactions during the hydrogen production from biogas ATR, homogenous SiSiC lattices composed of Cubic, Octet and Kelvin cells and the Conventional Foam structure <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>Ni</b> based catalysts doped with noble metals were investigated. The different catalytic geometries were tested using a model biogas composed of clean methane and carbon dioxide (60 : 40 Vol ratio) with a steam to carbon ratio (S/C) fixed at 2. 0. The effect of the space velocity, inlet temperature and oxygen to carbon ratio (O/C) on methane conversion and hydrogen yield were studied for each catalytic support. The O/C ratios evaluated was equal to 1. 0, 1. 1 and 1. 2. Space velocity (GHSV) values from 2000 to 20000 h- 1 in standard conditions (equivalent to 5000 - 85000 h- 1 in operating conditions), and, inlet temperatures of 500, 600 and 700 °C were employed. The combined effect of chemical reaction and some properties and parameters such as: pressure drop and specific surface area on the steady-state performances of an adiabatic reactor at high flow rates has been analyzed. ASPEN simulations were performed to calculate the thermodynamic equilibrium at the different boundary conditions to validate the data and to determine the hydrodynamic properties. This study has demonstrated that the rotated cubic cell support shows the best performance in transforming the biogas into hydrogen with high CH 4 conversion (< 95 %) and an H 2 yield higher of 2. 1 using an O/C ratio of 1. 0, 1. 1 and 1. 2, S/C ratio of 2 and GHSV of 20000 h- 1. Besides, this support can ensure a high reliability of the ATR process due to its lower pressure drop (6 - 40 Pa/m) with the lower specific surface area comparing to the other structures tested. The conventional foam has presented also good performances for all the GHSV values in terms of CH 4 conversion but it is less selective for hydrogen production. With respect to the catalyst for gasification of carbon in a reducing atmosphere (H 2, CO, H 2 O, CO 2), nano-materials based on transition metal were synthesized via a solution combustion synthesis (SCS) method. LiFeO 2 catalyst was selected as the most promising candidate for the soot gasification catalyst on the soot trap application close coupled to the ATR reactor for syngas post-treatment process. Afterwards, some issues in mixed atmosphere, i. e., when simultaneous carbon gasification with CO 2 and steam in the presence of H 2 and CO take place, were studied. It was demonstrated that the carbon gasification is inhibited during an isothermal reaction at 650 °C for 40 minutes when CO and H 2 are used as co-reagents. But even in these extreme reduced conditions, the LiFeO 2 -catalyst gasified 32. 9 % of the initial carbon, compared to 8 % for the non-catalytic case. when H 2 is used as co-reagent in the steam carbon gasification, the reaction is inhibited, the carbon conversion decreases from 73. 1 % to 46. 6 %. Analogously, when CO is a co-reactant in the carbon gasification with CO 2, the reaction is inhibited, the soot conversion declines from 70. 2 % to 31. 6 %. However, it was observed that in mixed atmosphere gasification reactions, when CO 2 and H 2 O simultaneously reacts with carbon, there is a passive combination of steam and carbon dioxide in the gasification reaction. This means that the two gases operate on separated active sites without influencing each other. LiFeO 2 was also coated on the monoliths (15 / 20 μm mean pore size and 45 % porosity) and the coated filters' performance was evaluated during the soot particles loading. The pressure drop across the filters was very low (< 8 mbar) during loading showing that the applied coated method on the filters was successfully. On the other hand, the catalytic filter coupled with the rotated cube cell was tested at the pilot plant to examine their interaction, the effect of the coating method and the penalty in pressure drop of all system. A pressure drop of 0 - 68 mbar obtained during the test proves that the coating method did not alter the operation of the plant. As for testing at the demonstration plant, firstly, a monolith (Rh/Pt) was tested close coupled with an uncoated filter using an O/C ratio from 0. 9 to 1. 3, S/C ratio equal to 2. 0, an inlet temperature (Tin) of 450 °C with a GHSV from 5000 to 14000 h- 1. The overall result fully agrees with the prediction from the simulation. The thermodynamic equilibrium was reached during the testing time with a methane conversion of 98 % and hydrogen yield of 2. 0. Moreover, tests with the integration of the catalyzed conventional foam and the catalytic trap downstream of the reforming reactor were performed. The boundary conditions were a space velocity of 4000, S/C= 2 and O/C= 1. 1. A thermodynamic equilibrium and a methane conversion higher than 98 % were achieved. The plant was able to reach the predicted conversions and concentrations at nominal capacities corresponding to 50 Nm 3 /h (100 Kg/day) of pure hydrogen, creating a negligible pressure drop during the operation time of the processor. Finally, this thesis also deals with a comparative LCA of three different hydrogen production process from biogas. The investigated processes are: the biogas ATR, the biogas steam reforming (SR) and the water hydrolysis (a biogas-fueled internal combustion engine (ICE) followed by an electrolyzer). They were compared using environmental (GWP) and energetic (GER) impacts in order to highlight their weaknesses and strengths. H 2 from biogas ATR has been demonstrated to be the most promising process in terms of the emissions reduction and energetic efficiency considering its life cycle from the extraction and processing of raw materials to the production of high purity hydrogen. The ICE + Electrolyzer process require a large amount of energy and biogas to sustain the electrochemical reactions. This feature makes such system the least energetically efficient with the most negative environmental impact. With a process efficiency of 65 %, 63 % and 25 % for ATR, steam reforming and electrolysis process, respectively. Lastly, the economic analysis was performed to evaluate the H 2 final cost. On the one hand, {{it was found that the}} process is economically favorable for H 2 production higher than 100 Nm 3 /h. On the other hand, in 10 years of amortization using this technology, the final cost for H 2 production of 100 Nm 3 /h from biogas is 3 €/Kg H 2, lower than the European target (5 €/kg H 2).

Formation of the flake-like graphene is attributed to the dewetting of the Ni layer coated on the PAN film.

40|$|NdFeB magnets {{currently}} {{dominate the}} magnet market {{due to their}} superior magnetic properties with maximum volume minimization. NdFeB magnets are composed of 25 - 35 wt. % rare earth elements (REE) along with ca. 1 wt. % B and the rest being transition metals (mainly Fe). REE, other than Nd, such as Dy, Pr, Tb and Gd or exogen elements, other than Fe, such as Al, Co, Ga, Nb, Si, Cu and Zr can also be present as minor admixtures. Depending on the operation medium, these magnets are usually also <b>coated</b> <b>with</b> <b>Ni,</b> Zn, etc. or can be embedded in epoxy. The on-going monopoly of China on REE oxide production {{in the last two}} decades along with continuously increasing demand for REE impose serious supply risks for certain REE (e. g. Nd and Dy). Due to their high REE content along with their increasing production rate, efficient recycling options for pre-consumer and end-of-life (EOL) NdFeB magnets are needed to combat that supply problem. To achieve these goals, 3 different hydrometallurgical or combined hydro- and pyrometallurgical flow sheets have been developed and completed within this thesis. These are namely, (1) Sulfation, Selective Roasting and Water Leaching, (2) Nitration, Calcination and Water Leaching, and (3) Complete Leaching, Iron Removal and Electrolysis. Both of the first two flow sheets were a combination of pyro- and hydrometallurgical methods and enabled > 95 % REE and 90 wt. %). In the third flow sheet, a different and only-hydrometallurgical approach was taken. Here, in addition to previous targets, it was aimed to recover minor but valuable base metals (e. g. Co, Ni and Cu) along with complete recycling of consumed acid and chemicals after electrolysis stage. However, this stage was found to be problematic and not a good candidate for purification of the leachate for REE. Additional steps were studied to overcome these problems and were found to be quite successful. However, the overall flow sheet extended significantly thereby requiring a justification through economic analysis. In the last phase of the doctorate, a separate work flow was studied, namely, (4) Comparative Oxidation Behaviors of Hydrogenated NdFeB Magnets. Here, it was aimed to investigate the thermal oxidation behaviours of differently hydrogenated magnets. Hydrogenation treatments are the most promising methods to physically remove waste NdFeB magnets from their surroundings. The oxidation tendency of the product after such treatments can be of importance for both direct and indirect recycling routes. While the initial composition of the magnet was found to have little or no effect on the oxidation behaviour of both hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated magnets, the hydrogenation treatment type had direct impact via both particle size distribution and oxidation mechanism. Among all 5 hydrogenation treatments, the hydrogenation decrepitation (HD) method was found to be the most effective treatment for subsequent conventional oxidative roasting-acid leaching flow sheet while disproportionated magnets were found to be the most stable powders.

The effect {{of different types}} of solvent, e. g. ethylene glycol and water, on the deposition of Ni on Cu was investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). On the other hand, the composition of the nanowires was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Smoother Cu-Ni nanowires were produced using ethylene glycol due to better dispersion of Cu nanowires and more controlled Ni diffusion during coating. This {{can be attributed to the}} slower reduction of Ni(II) ions in ethylene glycol, leading to a more controlled deposition on the Cu nanowires.

The main objective {{of this paper is}} to study effect of electroco-deposition method on microhardness and corrosion resistance of stainless steel, and to analyze effect of nanoparticles (Al 2 O 3, ZrO 2, and SiC) on properties of composite coatings. In this paper employed Electroco-deposition process to develop a composite <b>coating</b> <b>with</b> (<b>Ni)</b> matrix and Ceramic oxide particles: Al 2 O 3 (135 nm), ZrO 2 (40 nm), and SiC (80 nm) as reinforcements.

Further, passivation <b>with</b> chromate conversion <b>coating</b> helps to enhance the corrosion resistance. These coatings are being considered as effective replacements for cadmium coating. In the present study an effort {{has been made to}} develop Zn-Ni coating under nearly neutral conditions to minimize the embrittlement effect. The deposition conditions were optimized to obtain Zn-Ni alloy <b>coating</b> <b>with</b> <b>Ni</b> content in the range of 10 - 15 wt. % so as to achieve improved corrosion protection. The coatings were deposited under optimized conditions on a suitably pre-treated stainless steel (SS) substrate so as to obtain a coating of > 4 B. The Zn-Ni coatings were characterized using EDX for the Ni content and FESEM for surface morphology. The nanohardness of the as-deposited coating was observed to be 512 HVN for a load of 25 mN. The roughness of the coating was found to be around 70 nm. The electrochemical corrosion behavior of the coatings was evaluated in 3. 5 % NaCl medium using potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The polarization studies showed that the corrosion resistance of baked Zn-Ni coating (icorr 5. 36 µA/cm 2) was better than the as-deposited coating (icorr 23. 8 µA/cm 2). The baked Zn-Ni <b>coating</b> was passivated <b>with</b> chromate (Cr 6 +) conversion coating.
