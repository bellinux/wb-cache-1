50|$|Oil leakage was {{commonplace in}} {{the first few years of}} production, though the problem was {{eventually}} addressed by aftermarket <b>cam</b> <b>cover</b> gaskets made from reusable rubber. Later 900 series Lotus engines included a revised cam tower that greatly improved the <b>cam</b> <b>cover</b> sealing design. The later cam towers can be retrofitted to the earlier 907 engines. Early Jensen-Healey engines (1972-1973) had oil supply issues that made the oil pressure slow to build on start-up. Some early engines also had issues with oil drainage which resulted in too much oil being retained in the cam carriers. Differences between early and late 907 engines included rope seals for the rear of the crankshaft versus regular spring-loaded rubber lip seals for the rear of the crankshaft on later 907 engines.|$|E

50|$|The second {{generation}} {{had a higher}} profile cam design in the head, a <b>cam</b> <b>cover</b> with ribs throughout its length, and fuel injectors in the intake manifold runners. Mechanically, the late-model motors received MAP load sensing and redesigned pistons, intake ports, and intake manifold. The {{second generation}} engine was produced from 1992-1998 (1993-1997 in the US).|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} Elan and Lotus Cortina customers {{who wanted a}} higher performance engine, Lotus sold cars with optional Special Equipment engines, and Lotus Components Ltd sold the parts used in these engines. At first, these were Cosworth developed and assembled engines with cast cranks and Cosworth name plates on the <b>cam</b> <b>cover.</b> However, Cosworth soon distanced themselves from this business, and Lotus started selling 'BRM' equivalents. BRM Phase I consisted of BRM camshafts and high compression cast pistons, and BRM Phase II added Mahle forged pistons, BRM forged conrods, small-end bushes and big-end bolts to the Phase I. When offered in assembled form, these engines carried a BRM name plate on a specially cast 'BRM' <b>cam</b> <b>cover,</b> but the actual assembly of these high performance 'BRM' road engines {{was carried out by}} Rubery Owen & Co. Ltd., an affiliated company of BRM through its ownership, not by BRM itself.|$|E

5000|$|The F8-DOHC is a DOHC F8 and {{basically}} a de-stroked {{version of the}} FE-DOHC displacing 1789 cc - 1.8L. It uses the same exhaust cam, but a different intake cam with less lift and a long, single-runner intake manifold.

5000|$|The second-generation 4A-GE {{produced}} from 1987 to 1989 featured larger diameter bearings for the connecting-rod big ends (42 mm) and added four additional reinforcement ribs {{on the back}} of the engine block, for a total of seven. The T-VIS feature is maintained. It is visually similar to the first-generation engine (only the upper <b>cam</b> <b>cover</b> now featured red and black lettering) and the US market power output was only increased to [...] The first- and second-generation engines are very popular with racers and tuners because of their availability, ease of modification, simple design, and lightness.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, the L61 {{received}} {{a multitude of}} changes, that originated from the LE5. It switched to the higher-strength Gen II block and {{received a}} revised cylinder head (enlarged exhaust ports) and camshaft design (increased exhaust valve duration). The engine also switched from wasted spark ignition to individual coil-on-plug ignition, this forced the <b>cam</b> <b>cover</b> to be redesigned. It was also switched to an E37 engine controller with new crank and cam sensors (replacing timing sensor previously found in ignition cassette). These changes increase horsepower slightly and allow the engine to meet PZEV standards. Compression ratio is 10.0:1 ...|$|E
50|$|The FE-DOHC {{shares the}} same {{dimensions}} {{as the original}} FE-SOHC, including the square 86mm bore x stroke and it has an ideal 1.74 rod/stroke ratio. The FE-DOHC is usually identified by a gold coloured <b>cam</b> <b>cover,</b> however not always. There were at least five different FE-DOHC engines available with various compression ratio, camshaft and ECU tuning combinations however none were fitted with a turbocharger from the factory. Like many DOHC engines, this engine has an interference valvetrain design, making periodic timing belt changes vital to the engine's life. Should the timing belt break the engine should be replaced as piston and valvetrain damage will occur.|$|E
50|$|The various colour <b>cam</b> <b>covers</b> that {{distinguished}} each version were as follows: Red: YBB (Sierra Cosworth 2wd, both 3-door and Sapphire), YBD (Sierra RS500), YBJ (Sierra Sapphire 4wd, non cat); Green: YBG (catalyst equipped 4x4 Sierra Sapphire Cosworth); Blue: YBT (large-turbo Escort Cosworth); Silver: YBP (small-turbo Escort Cosworth).|$|R

The adoption of the EFI engine in 2008 rendered many of these accessories obsolete, since tank covers, tank badges etc. would not fit the redesigned tank.|$|R
