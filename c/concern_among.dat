5|$|A common <b>concern</b> <b>among</b> reviewers is the {{overhead}} perspective, which critics have bemoaned for {{preventing them from}} judging pathway routes and an object's location in relation to its background. Besides this, the actual visuals were generally well received, {{as well as the}} setting and animations. The audio was commended for combining both originality and nostalgia, even though it looped frequently.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} $40million {{marketing the}} Classic to first-time buyers, Apple had difficulty meeting the high demand. Apple doubled its manufacturing space in 1990 by expanding its Singapore and Cork, Ireland factories, where the Classic was assembled. Air freight, rather than sea shipping, {{was used to}} speed delivery. The shortage caused <b>concern</b> <b>among</b> dealers, who blamed Apple's poor business planning.|$|E
5|$|Although wolf-dog {{hybridization}} in Europe {{has raised}} <b>concern</b> <b>among</b> conservation groups fearing for the gray wolf's purity, genetic tests show that introgression of dog genes into European gray wolf populations does {{not pose a}} significant threat. Also, as wolf and dog mating seasons do not fully coincide, the likelihood of wild wolves and dogs mating and producing surviving offspring is small.|$|E

After his diagnosis, he began receiving treatment and continued to receive therapy and special education support until his junior year of high school.

5|$|The 2008 Georgia sugar {{refinery}} explosion was {{an industrial}} disaster that occurred on February 7, 2008 in Port Wentworth, Georgia, United States. 13 {{people were killed}} and 40 injured when a dust explosion occurred at a sugar refinery owned by Imperial Sugar. Dust explosions had been an issue of <b>concern</b> <b>among</b> United States authorities since three fatal accidents in 2003, with efforts made to improve safety and reduce the risk of recurrence.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{unmanned}} resupply spacecraft Progress M1-4 docked to {{the station}} on 18 November. The Progress spacecraft's automatic docking system failed, necessitating a manual docking controlled by Gidzenko using the TORU docking system. Although manual dockings are routine, they have caused some <b>concern</b> <b>among</b> flight controllers since an attempt in 1997 {{which resulted in the}} spacecraft colliding with Mir, causing significant damage.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{founding}} of Sandakan, Sulu Archipelago {{was the source of}} dispute between Spain and the Sultanate of Sulu for economic dominance in the region. By 1864, Spain had blockaded the Sultanate possessions in the Sulu Archipelago. The Sultanate of Sulu awarded a German consular service ex-member a piece of land in the Sandakan Bay to seek protection from Germany. In 1878, the Sultanate sold north-eastern Borneo to an Austro-Hungarian consul who later left the territory to a British colonial merchant. The German presence over the area raised <b>concern</b> <b>among</b> the British. As a result, a protocol was signed between the British, German and the Spanish to recognise Spanish sovereignty over the Sulu Archipelago, in return for the Spanish not intervening in British affairs in northern Borneo.|$|E
5|$|By 2009 {{some of the}} {{conditions}} required for a currency war had returned, with a severe economic downturn seeing global trade in that year decline by about 12%. There was a widespread <b>concern</b> <b>among</b> advanced economies {{about the size of}} their deficits; they increasingly joined emerging economies in viewing export led growth as their ideal strategy. In March 2009, even before international co-operation reached its peak with the 2009 G-20 London Summit , economist Ted Truman {{became one of the first}} to warn of the dangers of competitive devaluation. He also coined the phrase competitive non-appreciation.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{the salmon}} catch {{was smaller than}} usual in the rivers of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, causing <b>concern</b> <b>among</b> {{commercial}} fishermen, government agencies, and tribal leaders. US government intervention, to which the states of Alaska, Idaho, and Oregon objected, included an 11-day closure of an Alaska fishery. In April 1994 the Pacific Fisheries Management Council unanimously approved the strictest regulations in 18years, banning all commercial salmon fishing for that year from Cape Falcon north to the Canada–US border. In the winter of 1994, the return of coho salmon far exceeded expectations, which was attributed {{in part to the}} fishing ban.|$|E

5|$|Many long-time {{employees}} of Olympus Corp were shocked and angry, and felt {{betrayed by the}} executives who were responsible for bringing public humiliation onto the company. Former director Koji Miyata started a web site, called Olympus Grassroots, demanding clean-up at the company they say they love. Miyata also circulated a petition targeted at employees calling on the reinstatement of Woodford. As Olympus has a 70-percent market share in endoscopy, the scandal caused anxiety and <b>concern</b> <b>among</b> the medical profession, which sees Olympus endoscopes as irreplaceable.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} that the general strike could be used, but {{only as a last}} resort, became dominant in the party during the mass strike debate. This caused much <b>concern</b> <b>among</b> the conservatives in the party, especially among many trade unionists. At a meeting in February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, who said they would attempt to prevent a general strike at all costs. The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from the meeting in Die Einigkeit, greatly angering the party leadership.|$|E
5|$|Though the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise, made no {{move against}} Knox, his {{activities}} caused <b>concern</b> <b>among</b> the church authorities. The bishops of Scotland viewed him {{as a threat to}} their authority and summoned him to appear in Edinburgh on 15 May 1556. He was accompanied to the trial by so many influential persons that the bishops decided to call the hearing off. Knox was now free to preach openly in Edinburgh. William Keith, the Earl Marischal, was impressed and urged Knox to write to the Queen Regent. Knox's unusually respectful letter urged her to support the Reformation and overthrow the church hierarchy. Queen Mary took the letter as a joke and ignored it.|$|E

5|$|There were a {{few major}} {{accidents}} {{in the history of}} the MRT that raised safety <b>concerns</b> <b>among</b> the public. On 5 August 1993, two trains collided at Clementi station because of an oil spillage on the track, which resulted in 132 injuries. During the construction of the Circle Line on 20 April 2004, a tunnel being constructed under Nicoll Highway collapsed and led to the deaths of four people. Disruptions to the system of late, the cause of which often being cited by a lack of maintenance coupled with increased ridership due to population growth, have also raised <b>concerns</b> <b>among</b> the public.|$|R
5|$|Undaunted by {{this lack}} of {{confidence}} from his peers, Johnson continued to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was more vigorous than that of Van Buren, his behavior {{on the campaign trail}} raised <b>concern</b> <b>among</b> voters. He made rambling, incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, he raised his shirt in order to display to the crowd the wounds he received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he leveled against Harrison in Cleveland were so poorly received that they touched off a riot in the city.|$|E
5|$|As Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony {{maintained}} {{a distance from}} politics throughout {{the reign of the}} new monarch, RadamaII, instead preferring to focus on his military responsibilities. Meanwhile, disputes between Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony and King Radama grew frequent as the young sovereign pursued radical reforms that had begun to foment displeasure among the traditional masses. The situation came to a head on 7 May 1863, when Radama insisted on legalizing duels, despite widespread <b>concern</b> <b>among</b> the king's advisers that the innovation would lead to anarchy. The Prime Minister initiated the arrest of the menamaso, the prince's influential advisers, while Rainilaiarivony enacted his brother's instructions to keep the peace in the capital city. However, the situation deteriorated in dramatic fashion and, by the morning of 12 May, King RadamaII was declared dead, having been strangled on the Prime Minister's orders.|$|E
5|$|The Wehrmacht {{launched}} its {{attack on the}} morning of 5 July 1943 and met heavy resistance. There were far more Soviet anti-tank guns, minefields, anti-tank ditches and overall Soviet resistance than had been anticipated, making a breakthrough more difficult to achieve. Furthermore, from the outset they were subjected to frequent counterattacks from Soviet tank units. Despite this, by the end of 5 July the II SS-Panzer Corps had advanced through the first defensive belt on the southern side of the salient and reached the second, although the plan was to breach the first two belts and reach the third on the first day. Nonetheless, the panzer corps' penetration caused great <b>concern</b> <b>among</b> Soviet commanders, compelling Vatutin to commit almost all of Voronezh Front's operational reserves {{by the end of the}} first day.|$|E

5|$|Edward became king on his father's {{death in}} early 1936. However, he showed impatience with court protocol, and caused <b>concern</b> <b>among</b> {{politicians}} by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions. Only months into his reign, he caused a constitutional crisis by proposing marriage to Wallis Simpson, an American who had divorced {{her first husband}} and was seeking a divorce from her second. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing that a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective queen consort. Additionally, such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward's status as the titular head of the Church of England, {{which at the time}} disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a former spouse was still alive. Edward knew that the British government, led by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have forced a general election and would ruin his status as a politically neutral constitutional monarch. When it became apparent that he could not marry Wallis and remain on the throne, Edward abdicated. He was succeeded by his younger brother, George VI. With a reign of 326 days, Edward is one of the shortest-reigning monarchs in British history.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} {{as the military}} secretary to Sir John Byng, the Commander-in-Chief, Ireland, and in July 1831 became the State Secretary to the Marquess of Anglesey, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He was promoted to colonel on 22 July 1830. In 1834 he became the Inspector-General of Police in Ulster, but was passed over for the position of Inspector-General of the Irish constabulary in 1836; the possibility of his appointment to the latter post had caused some <b>concern</b> <b>among</b> Irish Tories, who felt he was too critical of the Orange Order. He was later rumoured to {{be a candidate for}} the governorship of Dominica, in the West Indies, though this post {{does not seem to have}} materialised. In 1838 he was ordered to Canada to act as adjutant-general for the force garrisoned there after the Rebellions of 1837. When Lord Hill was retiring from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in 1839, Anglesey was suggested as a replacement to succeed him, although he eventually turned down the job; had he taken it up, Stovin was widely expected to become his personal secretary, the same capacity he had served in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Jardine's tactics were {{successful}} in one respect: in six innings against the tourists ahead of the Tests, Bradman scored only 103 runs, causing <b>concern</b> <b>among</b> the Australian public who expected much more from him. At the time, Bradman was in dispute with the Board of Control, who would not allow players to write in newspapers unless journalism was their full-time profession; Bradman, although not a journalist, had a contract to write for the Sydney Sun. A particular irritation for Bradman was that Jack Fingleton, a full-time journalist, was allowed to write for the Telegraph Pictorial, although he required permission from the Board to write about cricket. Bradman threatened {{to withdraw from the}} team unless the Board allowed him to write. Fingleton and Bradman were openly hostile towards each other. From their first meeting while playing together for New South Wales, they disliked each other. Fingleton, conscious that Bradman's self-possession and solitary nature made him unpopular with some teammates, kept his distance after a dressing room argument, while Bradman believed the more popular Fingleton had tried to turn the team against him. Later hostility arose from Bradman's public preference for Bill Brown as a batsman, which Fingleton believed cost him a place on the 1934 tour of England. Fingleton's writings on the Bodyline series further soured the relationship. Bradman believed some of the differences stemmed from religion; Fingleton was a Roman Catholic, Bradman an Anglican.|$|E
