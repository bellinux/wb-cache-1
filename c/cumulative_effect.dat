The <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> of these dynamics is that {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century the Plains Aborigines were almost completely acculturated into the larger ethnic Han group, and had experienced nearly total language shift from their respective Formosan languages to Chinese. In addition, legal barriers to the use of traditional surnames persisted until the 1990s, and cultural barriers remain. Aborigines were not permitted to use their traditional names on official identification cards until 1995 when a ban on using aboriginal names dating from 1946 was finally lifted. One obstacle is that household registration forms allow a maximum of 15 characters for personal names. However, aboriginal names are still phonetically translated into Chinese characters, and many names require more than the allotted space.|$|E

Reefs are an important food source for low-technology fishing, both on the reefs themselves and in the adjacent seas. However, despite their great productivity, reefs are vulnerable to over-fishing, {{because much of the}} organic carbon they produce is exhaled as carbon dioxide by organisms at the middle levels of the food chain and never reaches the larger species that are of interest to fishermen. Tourism centered on reefs provides much of the income of some tropical islands, attracting photographers, divers and sports fishermen. However, human activities damage reefs in several ways: mining for construction materials; pollution, including large influxes of fresh water from storm drains; commercial fishing, including the use of dynamite to stun fish and the capture of young fish for aquariums; and tourist damage caused by boat anchors and the <b>cumulative</b> <b>effect</b> of walking on the reefs.

40|$|Wetlands {{are among}} the most ecologically {{productive}} lands in the world, but every year they continue to be lost due to increasing pressures from agriculture, industrial development, urbanization and the lack of effective mitigation to deal with such pressures. Despite environmental assessment processes, policies, and regulations to ensure the mitigation of affected wetlands, wetlands continue to experience a loss in areal extent, but more importantly, a functional net-loss. This is attributed, in large part, to the lack of incorporating <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> principles into project-based wetland impact assessment and mitigation.

40|$|The pace of {{development}} in Canada's North has renewed concerns about the potential <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> of increasing industrial growth on fragile northern ecosystems. Recent developments in the diamond industry in the Slave Geological Province have highlighted the potential additive and synergistic effects of such development. For example, Aboriginal communities {{are worried about the}} health of the Bathurst caribou herd, which is considered central to their way of life. This concern is compounded by the lack of integration of environmental assessment and planning efforts, which could serve to better protect the environment. This research considers the challenges associated with the assessment of <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects,</b> and various approaches to meet these challenges. Diamond mining in the Slave Geological Province, including the BHP and Diavik diamond mines, is used as a case study. Four sustainability-based criteria are developed to evaluate the past and existing situation in the diamond region, and to form the basis for recommendations that would contribute to a more holistic approach to integrating <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> considerations into environmental assessment and regional planning. The analysis demonstrates that although several mechanisms are currently in place to assess <b>cumulative</b> environmental <b>effects,</b> no single initiative fully meets each of the four criteria. However, existing tools can be used and supplemented to identify appropriate response options. The sustainability-based criteria developed here can contribute to further research on <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> assessment and sustainability.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2001. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} that EIA is limited in its scope. The main concern {{in this regard is}} that EIA generally fails to handle cumulative impacts effectively, due to its focus on individual projects. <b>Cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> are changes to the environment that are caused by an action in combination with other past, present and future human actions. The evaluation of <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> generally focuses on potential pervasive, regional environmental problems. Due to its strong focus on sustainable development, Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), by definition, should address <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects.</b> EIAs in South Africa traditionally only considered the "footprint" or area covered by each project component. However, in recent years the cumulative nature of environmental impacts of human actions has increasingly become a visible concern to the South African public, which has led to the need to infuse <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> concepts into environmental assessments. In theory, a SEA is aimed at improving the way in which <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> are dealt with in environmental assessments. This {{raises the question of whether}} past and present South African SEA approaches have effectively addressed the issue of <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects.</b> This thesis provides a critical reappraisal of recent experience in SEA with particular reference to its application in South Africa. It is in this context, of the opportunities and constraints of current SEA application, that this study attempts to determine how best to infuse <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> methodology and philosophy into the emerging South African SEA process. This study evaluates three SEA case studies undertaken in South African, in order to assess how effectively <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> are addressed within the current South African SEA process. The analysis focuses on both innovative approaches used in each study, as well as the limitations and deficiencies of each approach. A generic framework was developed in order to provide broad guidelines for practitioners and reviewers. These guidelines focus on how best to infuse <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> philosophy and methodology into the current SEA process. It is envisaged that this methodology will enhance the current SEA process, in order to ensure that environmental issues are placed on the same level as economic and social considerations in future decision making, to achieve sustainable development.

40|$|In Canada, {{interest}} in regional strategic environmental assessment {{as a framework}} for assessing <b>cumulative</b> environmental <b>effects</b> is growing. Strategic environmental assessment, and in particular regional strategic environmental assessment, is generally regarded as the preferred assessment framework within which to address <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> due to its broad scale of assessment and its focus on influencing future development. However, very little research has been done to confront the challenges, either conceptually or methodologically, in operationalizing strategic environmental assessment at a regional scale and in assessing <b>cumulative</b> environmental <b>effects</b> in this regional and strategic context. This dissertation advances work in this area by defining a conceptual framework and generic methodology for regional strategic environmental assessment that deliberately integrates <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> considerations. The research methodology includes a literature review, framework and case reviews, and three sets of interviews with Canadian and international practitioners, academics, and administrators knowledgeable on strategic environmental assessment and <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> assessment issues. The research results are reported in four manuscripts. The first manuscript presents a typology of current approaches to regional <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> assessment. The second manuscript reviews lessons from recent attempts at regional-scale, strategically-focused environmental analysis in Canada that include an impact assessment component and explicit attention to <b>cumulative</b> environmental <b>effects.</b> The third manuscript presents a structured framework for regional strategic environmental assessment in Canada, and the fourth manuscript discusses conceptual and methodological challenges that accompany the integration of strategic environmental assessment and <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> assessment. Significant findings include that <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> assessment does indeed represent a significant conceptual and methodological challenge in a strategic assessment context and that <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> assessment in this context requires more than simply “adding up” direct effects. Further, this research indicates that the seminal contribution of regional strategic environmental assessment is to determine the pace and nature of future development in a region, including significant regional environmental thresholds, targets, and limits; and to inform decision makers of the broader, the slower-moving, the farther-reaching, and perhaps the more insidious currents of environmental change. Moving forward, {{there is a need to}} further develop and demonstrate approaches to <b>cumulative</b> <b>effects</b> assessment in a strategic context, develop a supportive legislative and regulatory framework for regional strategic environmental assessment in Canada, and define the unique contribution of regional strategic assessment in relation to regional planning and management...|$|R
