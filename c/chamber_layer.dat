40|$|The RICH is a two {{gas chamber}} {{particle}} identification device: one being a wire chamber, {{the other a}} nitrogen expansion gas volume. Charged particles and photons are detected in the wire <b>chamber</b> <b>layer.</b> The expansion volume allows particles to expand away from each other, {{so they can be}} easily distinguishable. Monitoring this expansion gas is what our group is currently researching. Its purity is essential for the detection of the particles. The method used to monitor its purity is to expose a reference volume of nitrogen to photons from a deuterium lamp and measure its output with respect to the light source unhindered by the gas. The same is done with a sample of nitrogen taken from the detector. This ratio gives information leading to the sample gas ’ purity. I have written the software used to control our device in LabVIEW, a graphical programming language. It images the relative measure of transmittance from the PMT signals, controls gas flow, scans the monochromator, and calculates the chamber exhaust gas transmittance relative to the reference gas transmittance. The apparatus is being assembled by our group and is in its finishing stages. Further research is being done to monitor the purity of the gas in the wire chamber...|$|E

This species can be subdivided into form-groups, based {{on the characteristics of}} the megalospheric embryonic apparatus. The evolution of the species is orthogenetic. The specimens probably lived with the apex of the cone pointed downward. The microspheric test starts with a strepto-spiral, the megalospheric test with an embryonic apparatus consisting of a proloculus, a deuteroconch, and a varying number of epiembryonic chambers. The embryonic apparatus is the only consistent feature on which the age of Orbitolina can be determined; the method applied will be described.

40|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the eighties}} Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) has been {{successfully}} used for the preparation of multilayers having X-ray optical quality. Outstanding features of the PLD-process are high thickness uniformity, precision of deposition process, formation of smooth interfaces and suppression of columnar thin film growth regime. In order to gain high quality layer stacks involving uniform thickness or graded thickness distributions across 4 "-wafers the conventional thin film PLD-equipment has been modified. It provides a precise spatial control of the plasma plume orientation in the UHV deposition <b>chamber.</b> <b>Layer</b> stack morphology, interface roughness and reproducibility of period thickness in the total layer stack were characterized by means of grazing incidence X-ray reflectometry (Cu K alpha radiation) and HREM (High Resolution Electron Microscopy).

40|$|Since {{combustion}} is an {{easy way}} to achieve large quantities of energy from a small volume, we developed a MEMS based solid propellant microthruster array for small spacecraft and micro-air-vehicle applications. A thruster is composed of a fuel <b>chamber</b> <b>layer,</b> a top-side igniter with a micromachined nozzle in the same silicon layer. Layers are assembled by adhesive bonding to give final MEMS array. The thrust force is generated by the combustion of propellant stored in a few millimeter cube chamber. The micro-igniter is a polysilicon resistor deposited on a low stress SiO 2 /SiNx thin membrane to ensure a good heat transfer to the propellant and thus a low electric power consumption. A large range of thrust force is obtained simply by varying chamber and nozzle geometry parameters in one step of Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE). Experimental tests of ignition and combustion employing home made (DB+x% BP) propellant composed of a Double-Base and Black-Powder. A temperature of 250 therefore degrees C, enough to propellant initiation, is reached for 40 mW of electric power.

Tears in the remaining anterior LC may compromise surgical outcome. We investigated whether biophysical differences in the rim properties of the LC remaining in the patient after manual or FL capsulotomy (FLC) lead to different risks with regard to anterior tear formation.; Lens capsule samples obtained by either continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC) or FLC were investigated by light microscopy, laser scanning confocal microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy; atomic force microscopy (AFM) {{was used to test}} the biomechanical properties of the LC. The mechanical stability of the LC following either of the two capsulotomy techniques was simulated by using finite-element modeling.; Continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis produced wedge-shaped, uniform rims, while FLC resulted in nearly perpendicular, frayed rims with numerous notches. The LC is composed of two sublayers: a stiff epithelial layer that is abundant with laminin and a softer anterior <b>chamber</b> <b>layer</b> that is predominantly made from collagen IV. Computer models show that stress is uniformly distributed over the entire rim after CCC, while focal high stress concentrations are observed in the frayed profiles of LC after FLC, making the latter procedure more prone to anterior tear formation.; Finite-element modeling based on three-dimensional AFM maps indicated that CCC leads to a capsulotomy rim with higher stress resistance, leading to a lower propensity for anterior radial tears than FLC...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{morphology}} of a duplication {{phenomenon of}} the canine Descemet’s membrane (DM) is described in relation to signalment, history, and ocular disease status. Sixty-six canine eyes from the Comparative Ocular Pathology Laboratory of Wisconsin archives between 2000 and 2007 were examined. All cases were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Alcian blue periodic acid–Schiff (PAS), while 14 cases were additionally stained with Masson’s trichrome, picrosirius red, cytokeratin AE 1 /AE 3 (CK), vimentin, and a-smooth muscle actin (SMA). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examination was performed in 3 corneas and in 1 normal control eye. Alcian blue PAS staining and TEM confirmed the basement membrane nature of the abnormal secondary DM. The thickness of the first DM, {{referred to as the}} corneal layer (CL) and the second or anterior <b>chamber</b> <b>layer</b> (ACL), were nearly the same, with no significant difference seen (P 5. 93). In 39 % (26 / 66) of the eyes, a fibrous, collagenous matrix component was present between the CL and ACL, which contains vimentin-positive and a-SMA-negative spindle cells (14 / 14). The corneal endothelial cells in 7 / 14 eyes stained weakly with CK and strongly in 2 additional eyes. The most frequent histopathologically confirmed, clinical ocular histories were chronic glaucoma in 76 % (50 / 66) of eyes, previous intraocular surgery in 36 % (24 / 66), lens luxation in 21 % (4 / 66), and blunt trauma in 15 % (10 / 66) of the cases. We speculate that activation and migration of endothelial cells, in association with trauma or lens contact, {{play a role in the}} pathogenesis of this phenomenon.

40|$|The ATLAS barrel level- 1 muon trigger {{processes}} hit {{information from}} the resistive plate chamber detector, identifying candidate muon tracks and assigning them to a programmable p/sub T/ range and to a unique bunch crossing number. The trigger system uses up to seven detector layers and seeks hit patterns compatible with muon tracks in the bending and nonbending projection. The basic principle of the algorithm is to demand a coincidence of hits in the different <b>chamber</b> <b>layers</b> within a path. The width of the road {{is related to the}} p/sub T / threshold to be applied. The system is split into an on-detector and an off-detector part. The on-detector electronics reduces the information from about 350 k channels to about 400 32 -bit data words sent via optical fiber to the so-called sector logic (SL). The off- detector SL electronics collects muon candidates and associates them to detector regions-of-interest of Delta eta * Delta Phi of 0. 1 * 0. 1. The core of the on-detector electronics is the coincidence matrix ASIC (CMA), which fulfils both the trigger algorithm and the readout of the RPC detector. Each CMA is able to process and readout 192 RPC strips from as many as four detector layers. In order to keep the full level- 1 system latency below 2 mu s, the CMA has to find candidate muon tracks with a latency of a few 25 ns bunch crossing periods.
