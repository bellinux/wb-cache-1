5|$|Apart {{from active}} flight, thrips, even {{wingless}} ones, {{can also be}} picked up by winds and transferred long distances. During warm and humid weather, adults may <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tips of plants to leap and catch air current. Wind-aided dispersal of species has been recorded over 1600km of sea between Australia and South Island of New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|It {{has become}} a {{tradition}} for Steelers fans to take Terrible Towels on vacation, taking pictures next to well-known tourist destinations. Fans have taken the Towel to locations such as the Great Wall of China, the South Pole, Vatican City, and {{to the top of}} Mount Kilimanjaro. Hampton native Kevin Cherilla took his Terrible Towel during his <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> peak of Mount Everest.|$|E
5|$|Most notable was {{the closure}} of the Monitor Ridge trail, which {{previously}} let up to 100 permitted hikers per day <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> summit. On July 21, 2006, the mountain was again opened to climbers. In February 2010, a climber died after falling from the rim into the crater.|$|E

Moniz then <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> summit of Mount Kilimanjaro with his twin sister Kaylee {{at the age of}} 10, accompanied by their parents. He also <b>climbed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> summit of Aconcagua, the highest summit in the Americas. He was <b>the</b> youngest person <b>to</b> ever reach <b>the</b> summit.|$|R

5|$|Altgens photographed President Kennedy for the AP in 1961 at Perrin Air Force Base. Kennedy and his {{predecessor}} Dwight D.

5|$|The B-70 {{was planned}} to use a high-speed, high-altitude bombing {{approach}} that followed a trend of bombers flying progressively faster and higher {{since the start of}} manned bomber use. Through that same period, only two weapons proved effective against bombers: fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA). Flying higher and faster made it more difficult for both; higher speeds allowed the bomber to fly out of range of the weapons more quickly, while higher altitudes increased the time needed for fighters to <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bombers, and greatly increased the size of the AAA weapons needed to reach those altitudes.|$|E

5|$|The Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal is a disused canal in Greater Manchester, England, {{built to}} link Bolton and Bury with Manchester. The canal, when fully opened, was 15miles 1furlong (24.3km) long. It was {{accessed}} via a junction with the River Irwell in Salford. Seventeen locks {{were required to}} <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> summit as it passed through Pendleton, heading northwest to Prestolee before it split northwest to Bolton and northeast to Bury. Between Bolton and Bury the canal was level and required no locks. Six aqueducts were built to allow the canal to cross the rivers Irwell and Tonge and several minor roads.|$|E
5|$|Giampaolo Caruso led {{the group}} into Ans and towards the <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> finish. At {{the foot of}} the climb, Daniel Moreno, Caruso's teammate, {{attacked}} and built a small gap ahead of the group. The group did not initially chase him, as all the other riders looked for Valverde to do the work. Eventually Valverde did start to chase Moreno and caught him at the final bend. He opened his sprint from a long way out, with Joaquim Rodríguez (Katusha) right behind him. Rodríguez slowed as they approached the line, however, and Valverde took the victory. Julian Alaphilippe came around Rodríguez in the final metres to take second place.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers are {{affected}} by diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. The bacteria Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have both been implicated in causing disease in grasshoppers, as has the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. This widespread fungus {{has been used to}} control various pest insects around the world, but although it infects grasshoppers, the infection is not usually lethal because basking in the sun has the result of raising the insect's temperature above a threshold tolerated by the fungus. The fungal pathogen Entomophaga grylli is able to influence the behaviour of its grasshopper host, causing it to <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of a plant and cling to the stem as it dies. This ensures wide dispersal of the fungal spores liberated from the corpse.|$|E

5|$|Kotzer {{estimated}} that a frontal assault against the Egyptians would be useless, {{as they were}} dug in {{on both sides of}} the pillbox. In complete darkness, the 1st Company made its way south through the wadi hoping to avoid enemy fire from superior positions and weapons until they were close enough to respond. At 03:00, the Israeli artillery barrage started, but did not do significant damage and only alerted all Egyptian positions to the Israeli presence. The only Israeli unit close to engagement at the time was Kotzer's company. About 100 m away from the Egyptian defense line, they stepped into an ambush and the leading squad was eliminated. Kotzer ordered the machine gunners to <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east bank of the wadi to provide cover for a counterattack, and this move also led to Israeli casualties. The counterattack was difficult and only destroyed some small Egyptian entrenchments.|$|E
5|$|Redback spiderlings cohabit on the {{maternal}} web {{for several days}} to a week, during which time sibling cannibalism is often observed. They then leave by being carried on the wind. They follow light and <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of nearby logs or rocks before extending their abdomens {{high in the air}} and producing a droplet of silk. The liquid silk is drawn out into a long gossamer thread that, when long enough, carries the spider away. This behaviour is known as ballooning or kiting. Eventually, the silken thread will adhere to an object where the young spider will establish its own web. They sometimes work cooperatively, climbing, releasing silk and being carried off in clusters. Juvenile spiders build webs, sometimes with other spiders.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Ramcharitmanas, there is a section devoted to the veneration of the name of Rama. As per Tulsidas, repeating the name of Rama is the only means to attain God in the Kali age where the means suited for other ages like meditation, Karma, and Puja are ineffective. He says in Kavitavali that his own redemption is because of the power, glory and majesty of the name of Rama. In a couplet in the Gitavali, Tulsidas says that wishing for liberation without refuge in the name of Rama is like wishing to <b>climb</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sky by holding on to the falling rain. In his view, the name of Rama is greater than both Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God – it controls both of them and is illuminates both like a bilingual interpreter. In a verse in the Dohavali, Tulsidas says that the Nirguna Brahman resides in his heart, the Saguna Brahman resides in his eyes and the name of Rama resides on his tongue, as if a radiant gemstone is kept between the lower and upper halves of a golden casket. He holds that Rama is superior to all other names of God, and argues that ra and ma being are the only two consonants that are written above all other consonants in the conjunct form in Sanskrit because they are the two sounds in the word Rama.|$|E
