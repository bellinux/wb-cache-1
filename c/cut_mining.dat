5000|$|The {{extraction}} process was started {{during the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, and involved the building of exclusive leach pad processing operations of the extracted uranium ores, apart from open <b>cut</b> <b>mining.</b> Initially, the Artois deposits were extracted by open <b>cut</b> <b>mining</b> up to 60 m depth with production rate of 0.30 - 0.35% ore. Lower grade uranium are exploited up to deeper depths of 90 m), but with lower ore extraction rate of 0.20 - 0.25%.|$|E
50|$|Open-pit, open-cast or open <b>cut</b> <b>mining</b> is {{a surface}} mining {{technique}} of extracting rock or minerals {{from the earth}} by their removal from an open pit or borrow.|$|E
50|$|Development of {{the brown}} coal {{reserves}} at Morwell was started by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) in 1949 as the 'Morwell Project', which included the Morwell open <b>cut</b> <b>mine,</b> and the Morwell briquette works. The Morwell Interconnecting Railway linked the power station and briquette works to the Yallourn open <b>cut</b> <b>mine</b> until 1993.|$|R

50|$|The SECV {{built the}} open <b>cut</b> <b>mine</b> in the Latrobe Valley {{and opened the}} first of many brown coal fired power {{stations}} in the Latrobe Valley. Yallourn power station was built progressively from the 1920s to the 1960s. Since then the SECV opened two more open <b>cut</b> <b>mines</b> in the valley, feeding power stations at Hazelwood and Loy Yang.|$|R
50|$|Coal mining {{formed the}} basis of the local economy from 1908 to 1919; however, this was brought to an end in 1930 when open <b>cut</b> <b>mining</b> was {{developed}} in the Latrobe Valley.|$|E
50|$|Hunter Valley Operations (HVO) is a multi-seam, multi-pit open <b>cut</b> <b>mining</b> {{operation}} {{located in}} the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, 24 km northwest of Singleton and 110 km from Newcastle.|$|E
50|$|Another major {{industry}} in the region was coal-mining. Centennial Coal operated the Charbon coal mine until its closure. The underground mine closed in March 2014, while open <b>cut</b> <b>mining</b> continued until 2015.|$|E

5000|$|Stage 1A - open <b>cut</b> <b>mining</b> of {{high grade}} {{magnetite}} ore from four primary ore bodies and several associated satellite ore deposits. Processing of this ore will be through dry crushing and screening and dry magnetic separation.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} orebody {{was completely}} mined {{out by the}} end of 1995, although some ore remains stockpiled. A second orebody ("Ranger 3") began mining in 1997. Both have been open-pit mines. Open <b>cut</b> <b>mining</b> finished at Ranger in late 2012 and the mine is now processing stockpiled ore.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 {{there is}} renewed {{interest}} in mining wolfram, molybdenite and bismuth at Wolfram, and an open <b>cut</b> <b>mining</b> operation approximately 1 km south of {{the site of the}} former La Société Française des Métaux Rares plant, is proposed. In 2016, the open cut mine was sold to ATC Alloys Limited.|$|E

50|$|On 18 May 1922, the Queensland Governor Matthew Nathan officially opened Australia's first open <b>cut</b> <b>mine</b> at Blair Athol.|$|R
50|$|The current mining {{operation}} at Whim Creek {{consists of an}} open <b>cut</b> <b>mining</b> operation, utilising drill-and-blast, trucking ore from Whim Creek and Mons Cupri to a central heap leach hydrometallurgy operation midway between the two. The operation runs via contract mining, with a fleet of five haul trucks and two production drill rigs.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, open <b>cut</b> <b>mining</b> {{continued}} in the high-grade areas {{in the first half}} of the year, then onto the lower grade northern section of the pit from the third quarter. Open pit ore was supplemented in the processing plant by higher grade underground ore. Gold production increased by 11% to 455,000 ounces.|$|E
5000|$|The area {{once had}} three {{separate}} town sites - Mount Magnet, Boogardie, and Lennonville. Boogardie {{has since been}} swallowed up into the open <b>cut</b> <b>mining</b> operations at Hill 50. Lennonville was abandoned {{at the start of}} World War I, and the foundations of the bank and train station can still be seen.|$|E

30|$|In open <b>cut</b> <b>mines</b> in Indonesia, {{there are}} many sites where mining {{operations}} have developed long highwalls which have been abandoned due to the current economic condition. Mining operations is then transferred to lower stripping ratio blocks of coal or overlying seams. It is estimated that {{a great deal of}} coal beneath abandoned in the highwall. Considering these situations, it seems to be worth introducing highwall mining systems into Indonesian open <b>cut</b> <b>mines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Morwell end of {{the highway}} was {{deviated}} westwards in 2006 {{as part of the}} Hazelwood Power Station West Field open <b>cut</b> <b>mine</b> expansion.|$|R
50|$|From {{the late}} 1950s, the {{industry}} experienced major change {{owing to the}} conversion from steam locomotives to diesel locomotives by Queensland Rail, {{the rapid growth of}} the export market and the development of large-scale open <b>cut</b> <b>mining.</b> By the end of the 20th century, Queensland was the nation's largest coal producer and over 90% of the state's coalmines were open cut.|$|E
50|$|The deposit was {{delineated}} by {{diamond drilling}} in 1970 and 1971. Open <b>cut</b> <b>mining</b> {{took place between}} June and October 1979 with the ore stockpiled for milling. 546,437 t of ore were mined at an average grade of 1.84% U3O8. The mill commenced operation in June 1980 and ran until 1988, during which time 11,084 t U3O8 were produced. The site was fully rehabilitated by 1995.|$|E
50|$|Open <b>cut</b> <b>mining</b> {{was carried}} out at Golden Ridges mine between 1932 and 1941, and other pits yielded gold in the Namie area {{both before and after}} the war. Most were small and short-lived; the richest was Golden Peaks, {{producing}} about six and half tonnes of gold between 1962 and 1977. The Golden Peaks mill also processed ore brought to it by an aerial ropeway from new workings at Upper Ridges.|$|E
50|$|The smelter {{works and}} {{associated}} open <b>cut</b> <b>mine</b> workings are located {{around the base}} of a small hill, on the southern side of small watercourse.|$|R

5000|$|Heat was {{reclaimed}} {{from the}} turbine bled steam produced by electricity generation, {{and used to}} dry brown coal from up to 65% moisture down to 10% for use in coal briquettes manufactured on the site for both domestic consumption and export. The Energy Brix power station has five steam turbines with a combined generation capacity of [...] The power station sources raw brown coal for briquette production from the Yallourn and Loy Yang open <b>cut</b> <b>mines,</b> and its steaming coal for power generation from the Morwell open <b>cut</b> <b>mine.</b>|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{coal mining}} {{has been the}} most {{dangerous}} energy activity and the list of historical coal mining disasters is a long one. Underground mining hazards include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapse and gas explosions. Open <b>cut</b> <b>mining</b> hazards are principally mine wall failures and vehicle collisions. In the US alone, more than 100,000 coal miners have been killed in accidents over the past century, with more than 3,200 dying in 1907 alone.|$|E
50|$|By this time, {{commercial}} exploitation of coking coal in the Bowen Basin for the export market was commencing {{on a massive}} scale to supply the booming Japanese steel industry. International consortiums and mining companies introduced open <b>cut</b> <b>mining</b> methods using huge mining plant including some of the biggest draglines in the world. This revolutionised mining techniques in Queensland; small scale underground mines were largely superseded and the nature of coal mining in Queensland was completely transformed.|$|E
50|$|Nickel laterites are {{generally}} mined via open <b>cut</b> <b>mining</b> methods. Nickel is {{extracted from the}} ore {{by a variety of}} process routes. Hydrometallurgical processes include high-pressure acid leach (HPAL) and heap leach, both of which {{are generally}} followed by solvent extraction - electrowinning (SX-EW) for recovery of nickel. Another hydrometallurgical routes is the Caron process, which consists of roasting followed by ammonia leaching and precipitation as nickel carbonate. Additionally, ferronickel is produced by the rotary kiln - electric furnace (RKEF) process.|$|E
50|$|New Hope is an independent, {{energy company}} which has open <b>cut</b> <b>mines</b> at Acland on the Darling Downs and at Rosewood near Ipswich. The New Acland open <b>cut</b> <b>mine</b> is located {{approximately}} 150 kilometres west of Brisbane in the Darling Downs region of Queensland. The mining method used at New Acland {{is an open}} cut multi-thin-seam operation which utilises trucks, excavators and front-end loaders. Overburden is blasted or ripped by bulldozers prior to extraction. New Oakleigh operates an open <b>cut</b> coal <b>mine</b> {{near the town of}} Rosewood, 23 kilometres west of Ipswich and 92 kilometres from the Port of Brisbane. The mining method used at New Oakleigh is a multi-thin-seam operation utilising trucks, excavators and front-end loaders. Overburden is blasted or ripped by bulldozers prior to extraction.|$|R
50|$|By the 1970s, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that there were significant coal seams under the town. In order to construct an open <b>cut</b> <b>mine,</b> the town had to be sacrificed.|$|R
