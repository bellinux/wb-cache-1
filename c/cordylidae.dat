5000|$|Femoral {{pores are}} present in all genera in the {{families}} <b>Cordylidae,</b> Crotaphytidae, Hoplocercidae, Iguanidae, Phrynosomatidae, and Xantusiidae.

50|$|Lizards have {{frequently}} evolved convergently, with multiple groups independently developing similar morphology and ecological niches. Anolis ecomorphs {{have become a}} model system in evolutionary biology for studying convergence. Limbs have been lost or reduced independently over two dozen times across lizard evolution, including in the Anniellidae, Anguidae, <b>Cordylidae,</b> Dibamidae, Gymnophthalmidae, Pygopodidae, and Scincidae; snakes are just the most famous and species-rich group of Squamata to have followed this path.|$|E
50|$|The genus Cordylus (Sauria: <b>Cordylidae)</b> {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of small- to medium-sized spiny lizards from Africa, collectively called girdle-tailed or girdled lizards. All are diurnal and ovoviviparous (live-bearing, without shelled eggs). Most species are rupicolous (rock-dwelling), while a few species are arboreal or live in burrows. They defend themselves with osteoderms (flat bony plates in the skin) and by quickly retreating into rock crevices or burrows. Many species live in groups and males defend territories.|$|E
