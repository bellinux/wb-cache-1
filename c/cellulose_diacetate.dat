The DAC and mixed (DAC+PDEG) layers were inserted between indium tin oxide (ITO) and MO-PPV polymer. The optical properties (UV-Vis) of MO-PPV, PDEG and mixed (DAC+PDEG) in solutions were studied and compared to those on thin films. Detailed current-voltage measurements of the bi-layers devices showed improvements of the threshold voltage (V-th) of the ITO/(DAC+PDEG) /MO-PPV/Al device attributed to the enhancement of carriers injection and transport resulted from the modified electrode structures. Conduction mechanisms of structure LEDs were matched with space-charge-limited current (SCLC) one. The impedance spectra for all devices can be {{discussed in terms of}} an equivalent circuit model designed as a parallel resistor R-p and capacitor C-p network in series with resistor R-s. The ITO/(DAC+PDEG) /MO-PPV/Al device showed the lowest impedance attributed to the removal of contaminants and to changes in the work function of ITO. The frequency-dependent electrical properties of the ITO/(DAC+PDEG) /MO-PPV/Al structure is analyzed by impedance spectroscopy as function of bias. We have extracted numerical values of the equivalent circuit model parameters by fitting experimental data. Their evolution with bias voltages has shown that the SCLC mechanism is characterized by an exponential trap distribution...|$|R

50|$|<b>Cellulose</b> <b>diacetate</b> {{film was}} first {{created by the}} German chemists Arthur Eichengrün and Theodore Becker, who {{patented}} it under the name Cellit, from a process they devised in 1901 for the direct acetylation of cellulose at a low temperature to prevent its degradation, which permitted the degree of acetylation to be controlled, thereby avoiding total conversion to its triacetate. Cellit was a stable, non-brittle cellulose acetate polymer that could be dissolved in acetone for further processing. A <b>cellulose</b> <b>diacetate</b> film more readily dissolved in acetone {{was developed by the}} American chemist George Miles in 1904. Mile's process (partially hydrolysing the polymer) was employed commercially for photographic film in 1909 by Eastman Kodak and the Pathé Fréres. Starting with <b>cellulose</b> <b>diacetate,</b> this innovation continued with cellulose acetate propionate and cellulose acetate butyrate in the 1930s, and finally in the late 1940s, cellulose triacetate was introduced, alongside polyester bases. These less flammable substitutes for nitrate film were called safety film.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cellulose</b> <b>diacetate</b> {{has been}} used to make fabrics, membranes, filaments, and many {{consumer}} products. From 1922 to 1957 it was used to make film stock, mainly in smaller formats such as 8 mm, 16 mm, 35 mm, and 70 mm.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cellulose</b> <b>diacetate,</b> {{sometimes}} simply called diacetate, is {{a synthetic}} polymer made by treating cellulose with acetic acid. It {{consists of two}} acetyl functional groups on each unit of D-anhydroglucopyranose of the cellulose molecule. It was first developed in the United States.|$|E
50|$|In 1903, Eichengrün co-developed {{the first}} soluble form of {{cellulose}} acetate with Theodore Becker. He went on to develop processes for the manufacture {{of cellulose acetate}} materials and devoted {{the rest of his}} life to the technical and economic development of plastics, lacquers, enamels, and artificial fibers based on cellulose acetate. During World War I his relatively non-inflammable synthetic cellulose acetate lacquers were important in the aircraft industry. He also pioneered the influential technique of injection moulding. In 1904, He created and patented the first safety film with Becker, (<b>cellulose</b> <b>diacetate)</b> from a process they devised in 1901 for the direct acetylation of cellulose at a low temperature to prevent its degradation, which permitted the degree of acetylation to be controlled, thereby avoiding total conversion to its triacetate. Cellit was a stable, non-brittle cellulose acetate polymer that could be dissolved in acetone for further processing. It was used to manufacture <b>cellulose</b> <b>diacetate</b> cinematographic film, which Eastman Kodak and the Pathé Fréres began to use in 1909. Cellulose acetate film became the standard in the 1950s, preferred over the highly flammable and unstable nitrate film (better known as celluloid).|$|E
50|$|A {{film base}} is a {{transparent}} substrate which {{acts as a}} support medium for the photosensitive emulsion that lies atop it. Despite the numerous layers and coatings associated with the emulsion layer, the base generally accounts {{for the vast majority}} of the thickness of any given film stock. Historically there have been three major types of film base in use: nitrocellulose (cellulose nitrate), cellulose acetate (cellulose triacetate, <b>cellulose</b> <b>diacetate,</b> cellulose acetate propionate, and cellulose acetate butyrate), and polyester (polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (Kodak trade-name: ESTAR)).|$|E
5000|$|... 1889: Film NegativesCellulose {{nitrate film}} was {{developed}} by Eastman Kodak in 1889 and refined in 1903. It is made of silver gelatin on a cellulose nitrate base. The negatives are flammable and therefore can be dangerous. Nitrate sheet film was used widely though the 1930s, while nitrate roll film was used through the 1950s. The nitrate base was replaced with cellulose acetate in 1923. By 1937, <b>Cellulose</b> <b>diacetate</b> {{was used as the}} base, and beginning in 1947 Cellulose triacetate was used.

5000|$|Cellulose triacetate, {{also known}} simply as triacetate, CTA and TAC, is a {{chemical}} compound manufactured from cellulose {{and a source of}} acetate esters, typically acetic anhydride. Triacetate is typically used for the creation of fibres and film base.It is similar chemically to cellulose acetate, with the distinguishing characteristics being that in triacetate, according to the Federal Trade Commission definition, at least [...] "92 percent of the hydroxyl groups are acetylated." [...] During the manufacture of triacetate the cellulose is completely acetylated whereas in regular cellulose acetate or <b>cellulose</b> <b>diacetate,</b> it is only partially acetylated. Triacetate is significantly more heat resistant than cellulose acetate.|$|E
50|$|During {{continuous}} contact printing, the {{raw stock}} {{and the negative}} are placed next to one another around the sprocket wheel of the printer. The negative, which is the closer of the two to the sprocket wheel (thus creating a slightly shorter path), must have a marginally shorter pitch between perforations (0.1866 in pitch); the raw stock has a long pitch (0.1870 in). While cellulose nitrate and <b>cellulose</b> <b>diacetate</b> stocks used to shrink during processing slightly enough to have this difference naturally occur, modern safety stocks do not shrink at the same rate, and therefore negative (and some intermediate) stocks are perforated at a pitch of 0.2% shorter than print stock.|$|E
5000|$|Acetate {{is derived}} from {{cellulose}} by deconstructing wood pulp into a purified fluffy white cellulose. In {{order to get a}} good product, special qualities of pulps - dissolving pulps - are used. A common problem with these is that the reactivity of the cellulose is uneven, {{and the quality of the}} cellulose acetate will sometimes be impacted. The cellulose is then reacted with acetic acid and acetic anhydride in the presence of sulfuric acid. It is then put through a controlled, partial hydrolysis to remove the sulfate and a sufficient number of acetate groups to give the product the desired properties. The anhydroglucose unit is the fundamental repeating structure of cellulose and has three hydroxyl groups which can react to form acetate esters. The most common form of cellulose acetate fiber has an acetate group on approximately two of every three hydroxyls. This <b>cellulose</b> <b>diacetate</b> is known as secondary acetate, or simply as [...] "acetate".|$|E
5000|$|Nitrate {{dominated}} {{the market for}} professional-use 35 mm motion picture film from the industry's origins to the early 1950s. While cellulose acetate-based so-called [...] "safety film", notably <b>cellulose</b> <b>diacetate</b> and cellulose acetate propionate, was produced in the gauge for small-scale use in niche applications (e.g., printing advertisements and other short films {{to enable them to}} be sent through the mails without the need for fire safety precautions), the early generations of safety film base had two major disadvantages relative to nitrate: it was much more expensive to manufacture, and considerably less durable in repeated projection. The cost of the safety precautions {{associated with the use of}} nitrate was significantly lower than the cost of using any of the safety bases available before 1948. These drawbacks were eventually overcome with the launch of cellulose triacetate base film by Eastman Kodak in 1948. [...] Cellulose triacetate superseded nitrate as the film industry's mainstay base very quickly. While Kodak had discontinued some nitrate film stocks earlier, they stopped producing various nitrate roll films in 1950 and ceased production of nitrate 35mm motion picture film in 1951.|$|E
5000|$|All plastic {{is subject}} to {{deterioration}} through physical or chemical means, and thus, motion picture film {{is subject to}} the same deterioration. Films deteriorate over time, which can damage individual frames or even lead to the entire film being destroyed. Cellulose nitrate, <b>cellulose</b> <b>diacetate</b> and triacetate are known to be unstable mediums: improperly preserved film can deteriorate in a period of time much faster than many photographs or other visual presentations. Cellulose nitrate, because of its unstable chemistry, eventually breaks down, releasing nitric acid, further catalyzing the decomposition. In the final stages of celluloid decomposition, the film turns into a rust-like powder. Likewise, tri-acetate stock is also vulnerable to deterioration. Because of the small gauge of the film, owners of home-made films often find that their film can become shrunken and brittle {{to the point where the}} film is unwatchable in the space of a few years. In general, decaying acetate film breaks down into acetic acid, and similar to celluloid decomposition, leads to an auto-catylictic breakdown of the base that cannot be reversed. The result of the acetic acid released is a strong odor of vinegar, which is why the decay process in the archival community is known as [...] "vinegar syndrome". Modern polyester-based stocks are far more stable by comparison and are rated to last hundreds of years if stored properly.|$|E
5000|$|Birt Acres was {{the first}} to attempt an amateur format, {{creating}} Birtac in 1898 by slitting the film into 17.5 mm widths. By the early 1920s, several formats had successfully split the amateur home movies market away from 35 mm: 28 mm (1.1 in) (1912), 9.5 mm (0.37 in) (1922), 16 mm (0.63 in) (1923), and Pathe Rural, a 17.5 mm format designed for safety film (1926). Eastman Kodak's 16 mm format won the amateur market and is still widely in use today, mainly in the Super 16 variation, which remains popular with professional filmmakers. The 16 mm size was specifically chosen to prevent third-party slitting, as it was easy to create 17.5 mm stock from slitting 35 mm stock in two. It also {{was the first}} major format to be released with only fireproof <b>cellulose</b> <b>diacetate</b> (and later cellulose triacetate) [...] "safety film" [...] base. This amateur market would be further diversified by the introduction of 8 mm film (0.31 in) in 1932, intended for amateur filmmaking and [...] "home movies". By law, 16 mm and 8 mm gauge stock (and 35 mm films intended for non-theatrical use) had to be manufactured on safety stock. The effect of these gauges was to essentially make the 35 mm gauge almost the exclusive province of professional filmmakers, a divide which mostly remains to this day.|$|E
50|$|As the {{quantity}} of film and filmmakers grew, the demand for standardization increased. Between 1900 and 1910, film formats gradually became standardized and film stocks improved. A number of film gauges were made. Eastman increased the length of rolls to 200 feet without major adjustments to the emulsion, retaining a large market share. Lumiere reformulated its stock to match the speed of Eastman film, naming it 'Etiquette Violette' (Violet Label). Blair sold his English company to Pathé in 1907 and retired to the US. Pathe began to supplement its operation in 1910 by purchasing film prints, stripping the emulsion from the film base and re-coating it. 35mm film began to become the dominant gauge because of the popularity of Edison's and Lumière's cameras. Consumers usually purchased unperforated film and had to punch it by perforators that were often imprecise, causing difficulty in making prints for the opposite perforation format. In 1908, the perforators began {{to be made by}} Bell and Howell. Eastman Kodak used the Bell and Howell's machine to perforate its films. In 1909, Edison's organization of the Motion Picture Patents Trust agreed to what would become the standard: 35 mm gauge, with Edison perforations and a 1.33 aspect ratio.Agfa began to produce motion picture film in 1913, but remained a largely local supplier until World War I boycotts of popular French, American and Italian film stocks allowed the UFA film studio to flourish, boosting Agfa's orders. All film stocks were manufactured on a nitrate film base, which is highly flammable. Nitrate film fires were difficult to extinguish. A significant number of fatal accidents occurred in theatrical projection booths, where the heat of the projector lamp made ignition most likely. Amateur filmmaking (home movies) slowly developed during this period. Kodak developed a heat-resistant 'safety base' for home projection. In 1909, tests showed <b>cellulose</b> <b>diacetate</b> to be a viable replacement base, and Kodak began selling acetate-base films the following year in 22 mm widths for Edison's work on the Home Kinetoscope, which was commercially released in 1912. Eastman Kodak introduced a non-inflammable 35 mm film stock in 1909. The plasticizers used to make the film flexible evaporated quickly, making the film dry and brittle, causing splices to part and perforations to tear. In 1911 the major American film studios returned to using nitrate stock. More amateur formats began to use acetate based film, and several, including Kodak's own 16 mm format, were designed specifically to be manufactured with safety base. Kodak released Cine Negative Film Type E in 1916 and Type F (later known as Negative Film Par Speed Type 1201) in 1917. As both of these orthochromatic films were no faster than previous offerings; the improvements were in granularity and sharpness.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Whether {{the nature}} of {{haemodialysis}} (HD) membranes can influence the outcome of acute renal failure (ARF) remains debatable. Recent {{studies have suggested that}} dialysis with bioincompatible unsubstituted cellulosic membranes is associated with a less favourable patient outcome than dialysis with biocompatible synthetic membranes. Since we generally use a modified cellulosic membrane with substantially lower complement- and leukocyte-activating potential than cuprophane, for dialysis of patients with ARF, and because there are no data in the literature regarding the influence of modified cellulosic membranes on the outcome of patients with ARF, we compared the outcome of ARF patients dialysed either with <b>cellulose</b> <b>diacetate</b> or with a synthetic polysulfone membrane. We also investigated the potential role of permeability by comparing membranes with high-flux versus low-flux characteristics. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, single centre study included 159 patients with ARF requiring HD. Patients were stratified according to age, gender, and APACHE II score and then randomized in chronological order to one of three dialysis membranes: low-flux polysulfone, high-flux polysulfone and meltspun <b>cellulose</b> <b>diacetate.</b> RESULTS: Aetiologies of ARF and the prevalence of oliguria were similarly distributed among the three groups. There {{was no significant difference between}} the three groups for survival (multivariate Cox's proportional hazards model, P= 0. 57), time necessary to recover renal function (P= 0. 82), and number of dialysis sessions required before recovery (P= 0. 86). Multivariate analysis showed that survival was significantly influenced only by the severity of the disease state (APACHE III score, P< 0. 0001), but not by {{the nature of}} the dialysis membrane (P= 0. 57) or the presence of oliguria (P= 0. 24). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with ARF requiring HD survival and recovery time are not significantly influenced by the use of either meltspun <b>cellulose</b> <b>diacetate</b> or the more biocompatible high-flux or low-flux polysulfone. Dialysis using modified cellulose membranes is just as effective as dialysis using synthetic polysulfone membranes, but at a lower cost.

They {{were subjected to}} soda pulping and hypochlorite bleaching system. Results obtained show that pulp yield from these materials were: 70. 00, 39. 59, 55. 40, 86. 00, 84. 60, 80. 00, 40. 84, 81. 67, 35. 70, 69. 11, 4. 54, 47. 19, 31. 70 and 52. 44 % respectively. The pulps were acetylated with acetic anhydride in ethanoic acid catalyzed by conc. H 2 SO 4 to obtain cellulose derivatives (<b>Cellulose</b> <b>diacetate</b> and triacetate). The <b>cellulose</b> <b>diacetate</b> yields were 41. 20, 17. 85, 23. 13, 20. 80, 20. 23, 20. 00, 39. 00, 44. 00, 18. 80, 20. 75, 20. 03, 41. 20, 44. 00, and 39. 00 % respectively while the results obtained as average of four determinations for cellulose triacetate yields were: 52. 00, 51. 00, 43. 10, 46. 60, 49. 00, 35. 00, 40. 60, 54. 00, 57. 50, 62. 52, 35. 70. 52. 00, 53. 00 and 38. 70 % respectively for all the agricultural wastes utilized. The presence of these cellulose derivatives was confirmed by a solubility test in acetone and chloroform...|$|E
