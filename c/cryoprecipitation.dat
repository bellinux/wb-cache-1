5000|$|A marked {{improvement}} in storage times {{was achieved by}} Belzer in 1967 [...] when he reported successful 72-hour kidney storage after returning {{to the use of}} continuous perfusion using a canine plasma based perfusate at 8-12 °C. Belzer [...] found that the crucial factor in permitting uncomplicated 72-hour perfusion was <b>cryoprecipitation</b> of the plasma used in the perfusate {{to reduce the amount of}} unstable lipo-proteins which otherwise precipitated out of solution and progressively obstructed the kidney's vascular system. A membrane oxygenator was also used in the system in a further attempt to prevent denaturation of the lipo-proteins because only 35% of the lipo-proteins were removed by cryo-precipitation. The perfusate comprised 1 litre of canine plasma, 4 mEq of magnesium sulphate, 250 ml of dextrose, 80 units of insulin, 200,000 units of penicillin and 100 mg of hydrocortisone. Besides being cryo-precipitated, the perfusate was pre-filtered through a 0.22 micron filter immediately prior to use. Belzer used a perfusate pH of 7.4-7.5, a Po2 of 150-190 mm Hg, and a perfusate pressure of 50-80 mm Hg systolic, in a machine that produced a pulsatile perfusate flow. Using this system Belzer had 6 dogs surviving after their kidneys had been stored for 72 hours and then reimplanted, with immediate contralateral nephrectomies being performed at the reimplantation operations.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} has been obtained that <b>cryoprecipitation</b> concentrates anti-A in mixtures of group O and group A plasma by a mechanism that does not operate in group O plasma alone. It has been concluded that the anti-A/A polysaccharide complex is less soluble during <b>cryoprecipitation</b> than anti-A immunoglobulin, and this complex dissociates to give free anti-A when the cryoprecipitate is redissolved.

40|$|Cryoglobulins are {{proteins}} that precipitate at temperatures below 37 °C. Cold-induced precipitation of proteins may occur in vivo secondary to several important diseases, {{and lead to}} pathological manifestations involving different organs. <b>Cryoprecipitation</b> may be observed in vitro by exposing serum samples, supposed to contain cryoglobulins, to low temperatures, but this needs several days to occur. Protein-protein interactions leading to <b>cryoprecipitation</b> are still poorly understood and {{the knowledge of the}} underlying mechanism may be relevant {{to the understanding of the}} onset of pathological manifestations. Using light-scattering spectrometry, we studied <b>cryoprecipitation</b> occurring in vitro at different temperatures and cryoglobulin concentrations. We describe the kinetics of the cold-induced precipitation of mixed cryoglobulins, measured as increase in turbidity. The plots obtained demonstrate that the <b>cryoprecipitation</b> did not occur as a single-step reaction, but consisted of four distinct phases where both temperature and cryoglobulin concentration affected the immune complexes formation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There are no {{guidelines}} {{for the management of}} patients with cryoglobulins during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) necessitating core hypothermia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a simple, pragmatic protocol of in vitro temperature-dependent <b>cryoprecipitation</b> of serum in patients with cryoglobulinemia before elective cardiac surgery with CPB. METHODS: A 44 -year-old female patient was known for chronic hepatitis C and type III cryoglobulinemia. Elective surgery was planned for an aortic arch aneurysm. A differential serum <b>cryoprecipitation</b> profile was established in vitro prior to surgery. RESULTS: Whereas, at temperatures or = 0. 112 g/L (normal value < 0. 05 g/L), at 20 degrees C and above, the precipitate was < or = 0. 016 g/L. Accordingly, surgery was performed without any cryoglobulin-related complications at an extracorporeal circulation temperature of 22 - 24 degrees C, to minimise the risk of <b>cryoprecipitation.</b> CONCLUSION: In elective cases of surgery with CPB and hypothermia, temperature-dependent differential serum <b>cryoprecipitation</b> profile may be an easy and efficient way to assess a safe peroperative level of temperature to avoid complications due to cryoglobulins, without enhancing the patient's tissue ischemia risks...|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} reported that fibronectin is {{a component of}} mixed cryoglobulins and is responsible in large part for cryoprecipitate formation.

Furthermore, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that next to the cryoglobulins, fibronectin constitutes the second major component of the cryoprecipitates. Depletion of the sera in fibronectin prior to exposure to 4 degrees C, markedly reduced <b>cryoprecipitation</b> of the cryoglobulins, whereas reconstitution in fibronectin restored it.

To determine whether the <b>cryoprecipitation</b> of IgG 3 mAb is enhanced or inhibited {{in the presence of}} specific ligand, we have established eight IgG 3 mAb reactive with 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (DNP) hapten: four mAb were obtained from fusion of spleen cells of C 57 BL/ 6 mice immunized with 2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenylated keyhole limpet hemocyanin, three from 129 /Sv and one from BALB/c immunized with DNP-lipopolysaccharide. Five of them induced cryoglobulins composed exclusively of the IgG 3 mAb. The binding of negatively charged monomeric DNP-amino acid conjugates completely inhibited the <b>cryoprecipitation</b> of all the five cryoprecipitating anti-DNP IgG 3 mAb, while the incubation with positively charged or neutral DNP-amino acid conjugates had variable effects: increase, inhibition or no change of the <b>cryoprecipitation.</b> In addition, positively charged DNP-amino acid conjugates were able to induce the <b>cryoprecipitation</b> of one of the non-cryoprecipitating anti-DNP IgG 3 mAb. Our data showed that (a) IgG 3 mAb derived from non-autoimmune strains of mice, similar to IgG 3 mAb derived from an autoimmune MRL-lpr/lpr strain, possessed the unique property to self-associate and were able to form cryoglobulins in most cases; (b) although the Fc-Fc interactions of IgG 3 mAb play a decisive role in IgG 3 cold solubility, IgG 3 <b>cryoprecipitation</b> was markedly influenced after interacting with their specific ligand, depending on the charge of the hapten-amino acid conjugate.

40|$|Fibrinogen and the cold-insoluble {{globulin}} of plasma (CIg) are {{the main}} protein components of the heparin-precipitable fraction of normal plasma. The interactions among these proteins and heparin were examined. Heparin formed a cold-precipitable complex with purified CIg or with mixtures of CIg and fibrinogen but not with purified fibrinogen alone. <b>Cryoprecipitation</b> was augmented by addition of Ca++ or by selection of optimal heparin levels; it was reduced or even abolished by raising the ionic strength or pH or both, or by raising the heparin concentration above that for maximum precipitation of CIg. Fibrinogen reduced the threshold for heparin-induced CIg <b>cryoprecipitation</b> and, by coprecipitating with heparin and CIg, increased the amount of precipitate that formed. In contrast to the heparin-precipitable fraction of normal plasma which contained both fibrinogen and CIg, that from a patient with congenital afibrinogenemia contained CIg but lacked fibrinogen. Normal plasma depleted of CIg by immunoabsorption failed to form a heparin-induced cryoprecipitate. Thus, CIg is essential for heparin-induced <b>cryoprecipitation</b> to occur. Fibrinogen, as assessed by chromatographic experiments with heparin-Sepharose columns, had a considerably lower binding affinity for heparin than did CIg, suggesting that it participates in precipitate formation mainly, if not entirely, {{by virtue of its}} affinity for CIg. The region of the fibrinogen molecule accounting for its precipitation with CIg appears to be localized in the carboxy-terminal segment of the Aα-chain; fibrinogen subfractions lacking this region failed to augment <b>cryoprecipitation</b> of heparin-CIg mixtures and, even though such species were present in normal plasma, they failed to coprecipitate in the heparin-induced complex...|$|E

On <b>cryoprecipitation</b> the monoclonal cryoglobulin preferentially interacted with autologous non-cryo IgG forming intermediate type, 9 S IgG– 11 S IgG complexes.

40|$|A murine IgG 3 mAb, 6 - 19, {{derived from}} {{autoimmune}} MRL-lpr/lpr mice, is a rheumatoid factor (RF) specific for IgG 2 a {{and is able}} to generate cryoglobulins via nonspecific IgG 3 Fc-Fc interaction. Intra-peritoneal passive transfer of ascites containing the 6 - 19 mAb into BALB/c mice induces skin leukocytoclastic vasculitis and acute glomerulonephritis associated with cryoglobulinemia. Because IgG 3 interact with each other, we have determined whether noncryoprecipitating IgG 3 mAb were able to inhibit the <b>cryoprecipitation</b> of 6 - 19 mAb and the development of related tissue lesions. In vitro, the <b>cryoprecipitation</b> of 6 - 19 mAb was almost completely inhibited by a fourfold excess of a noncryoprecipitating non-RF IgG 3 (9 - 106) mAb derived from MRL-lpr/lpr mice. <b>Cryoprecipitation</b> of five other IgG 3 mAb was similarly inhibited by the 9 - 106 mAb, and two other noncryoprecipitating IgG 3 mAb, including the 2 - 6 D antinuclear autoantibody, inhibited the <b>cryoprecipitation</b> of 6 - 19 mAb. In vivo, pretreatment of BALB/c mice with 9 - 106 or 2 - 6 D mAb prevented the development of skin vasculitis and glomerulonephritis induced by the 6 - 19 mAb. The cryoglobulin formation was greatly diminished in 9 - 106 or 2 - 6 D mAb-treated mice, although their serum levels of 6 - 19 mAb and RF activity were comparable to those of control mice. This indicated that pretreatment with non-cryoglobulin IgG 3 inhibited the cryoglobulin generation and cryoglobulin-associated tissue lesions induced by an IgG 3 RF cryoglobulin-generating mAb. These results suggest that the balance of formation of IgG 3 autoantibodies with or without the cryoglobulin activity may be critical for the development of IgG 3 cryoglobulin-mediated tissue lesions in murine lupus, particularly in MRL-lpr/lpr mice...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>cryoprecipitation</b> of a monoclonal IgM kappa cryoglobulin (Mou) {{with a cold}} agglutinin activity of Pr 2 specificity has been studied. By immunodiffusion this cryoglobulin reacted (by its Fab' fragment) with micellar GM 3, a ganglioside bearing the Pr 2 antigenic determinant. In contrast to previous reports that indicated a possible temperature dependent self-association of IgM molecules via an immunological interaction leading to cold precipitation, we could not detect any affinity of this cryoglobulin for IgM when we used passive hemagglutination or an {{indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). However, a GM 3 -like ganglioside could be extracted, by drastic methods, from the cryoglobulin studied at 22 degrees C, whereas no GM 3 was extracted from two control cryoglobulins. Some minor gangliosides (representing less than 25 % of total amount of bound gangliosides) were also extracted from Mou cryoglobulin and these gangliosides were shown to crossreact with GM 3, as they specifically bind to Mou cryoglobulin by ELISA. After <b>cryoprecipitation</b> the serum still contained a monoclonal anti-Pr 2 IgM kappa. A GM 3 -like ganglioside could be extracted from this purified IgM, and cryoprecipitability could be induced by the addition of a minute amount of micellar GM 3.

40|$|Cryoprecipitating IgG 3 autoantibodies {{have been}} shown to play a {{significant}} role in the development of murine lupus-like autoimmune syndrome. However, the structural basis of IgG 3 <b>cryoprecipitation</b> still remains to be defined. In view of the implication of positively charged amino acid residues present in variable regions in IgG 3 cryoglobulin activity, we explored the role of terminal sialic acids in oligosaccharide side chains for the cryogenic activity of IgG 3 mAb. Comparative oligosaccharide structural analysis of different cryogenic and non-cryogenic IgG 3 mAb showed an inverse correlation between the extent of sialylation and cryogenic activity. The inhibitory role of sialylation was further confirmed by the demonstration of enrichment of less and more sialylated IgG 3 in cryoprecipitated and noncryoprecipitated fractions, respectively, separated from four different cryogenic IgG 3 mAb. Significantly, the sialic acid contents of the latter fraction became comparable to those of non-cryogenic IgG 3 mAb. Finally, we observed that highly sialylated non-cryogenic IgG 3 mAb was more potent in the inhibition of <b>cryoprecipitation</b> of cryogenic IgG 3 mAb. Our results thus suggest that the content of negatively charged sialic acids in oligosaccharide side chains is one of the critical factors to determine IgG 3 cryoglobulin activity, along with amino acid sequences of the IgG 3 variable regions...|$|E

These differences seem to favor low-temperature-induced association between cryoglobulin molecules as an immediate consequence of increased intermolecular ionic or van der Waals forces.

Decrements in serum C 1 q binding activity caused by <b>cryoprecipitation</b> ranged from minimal to marked (1 – 73 %). Since all of these sera contained IgM rheumatoid factor, 7 were treated with 2 -mercaptoethanol, known to dissociate 19 S IgM into its subunits, and then tested for C 1 q binding activity and rheumatoid factor. 2 -mercaptoethanol eliminated rheumatoid factor activity in all cases, but C 1 q binding activity remained elevated in 6 to 7 sera, thus indicating the presence of immune complexes distinct form 19 S IgM rheumatoid factor complexes. By contrast absorption of 9 mixed cryoglobulinemia sera with solid-phase protein A resulted in the disappearance of immune complex-like material from the test sera, suggesting that IgG is a major constituent of the C 1 q binding material. Addition of eluate from the solid phase protein A to normal sera resulted in the appearance of increased C 1 q binding activity. Hepatitis B surface antigen was detected in the protein A eluate of two of six patient tested, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen was detected in the protein A eluate of a third patient.

40|$|The sera from 13 {{patients}} with malignant melanoma were evaluated for immune complexes by <b>cryoprecipitation</b> and the 125 I Clq binding assay. Cryoprecipitates {{were identified in}} 12 / 13 patients (92 %) and cryoimmunoglobulins in 7 / 13 patients (54 %). Either cryoimmunoglobulin or elevated Clq binding was identified in 8 / 13 patients (62 %). Incubation of normal monocytes with the resuspended cryoimmunoglobulin of 7 melanoma patients produced greater than 50 % reduction {{in the ability of}} the monocytes to respond to chemotactic stimuli (p <. 01). Similar inhibition was seen with cryoimmunoglobulin from erythema multiforme patients, but not with `medium alone, albumin, heat aggregated albumin or heat aggregated-IgG in similar concentrations. No soluble factors produced in vitro could be demonstrated to produce this inhibition. Inhibition of monocyte function by immune complexes may be an important component of impaired host response to malignant melanoma, or alternatively may represent an important mechanism for the accumulation of monocytes at sites of inflammation, analogous to migration inhibition factor...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{application of}} Factor IX concentrates is for hemo-philia B patients threatened with circulatory overloading when severe hemorrhages or surgical treatment make {{it necessary to}} replace the missing coagulation factor by whole blood or plasma transfusion. Unlike the preparation of a Factor VIII concentrate, which can be done very simply and efficiently with the <b>cryoprecipitation</b> pro-cedure according to Pool (r), the puriffcation of Factor IX for clinical use is rather complicated. With plasma as starting material, {{the result of the}} usual methods is not onlv the concentration of Factor IX on a protein basis, but also, due to tireir similar adsorption prop-erties, the purification of the other factors of the so-called prothrombin complex. Consequently, this type of preparation is useful not only for patients with hemophilia B, but also for those with a deffciency of the complex of Factors II, VII, IX and X, such as occur in severe liver function disturbances, real vitamin K deffciency,. and, last but no...|$|E
