2500|$|Soil {{stabilization}} is {{the permanent}} {{physical and chemical}} alteration of soils to enhance their physical properties. Stabilization can increase the shear strength of a soil and/or control the shrink-swell properties of a soil, thus improving the load-bearing capacity of a sub-grade to support pavements and foundations. Stabilization {{can be used to}} treat a wide range of sub-grade materials from expansive clays to granular materials. Stabilization can be achieved with a variety of chemical additives including lime, fly ash, and Portland cement. Proper design and testing is an important component of any stabilization project. This allows for the establishment of design criteria, and determination of the proper <b>chemical</b> <b>additive</b> and admixture rate that achieves the desired engineering properties. Stabilization process benefits can include: Higher resistance (R) values, Reduction in plasticity, Lower permeability, Reduction of pavement thickness, Elimination of excavation - material hauling/handling - and base importation, Aids compaction, Provides [...] "all-weather" [...] access onto and within projects sites. Another form of soil treatment closely related to soil stabilization is soil modification, sometimes referred to as [...] "mud drying" [...] or soil conditioning. Although some stabilization inherently occurs in soil modification, the distinction is that soil modification is merely a means to reduce the moisture content of a soil to expedite construction, whereas stabilization can substantially increase the shear strength of a material such that it can be incorporated into the project's structural design. The determining factors associated with soil modification vs soil stabilization may be the existing moisture content, the end use of the soil structure and ultimately the cost benefit provided. Equipment for the stabilization and modification processes include: <b>chemical</b> <b>additive</b> spreaders, soil mixers (reclaimers), portable pneumatic storage containers, water trucks, deep lift compactors, motor graders.|$|E

50|$|One unique {{feature that}} results from {{miniaturization}} of the sample vessel is the inevitable increased surface area to volume ratio.

In other instances, it is necessary to prevent the migration of molecules to the surface.

40|$|Broadly defined, {{hydraulic}} fracturing is a stimulation technique {{used in the}} oil and gas industry to create additional permeability through creating fractures in an unconventional gas reservoir. Desktop estimates predict that shale deposits beneath the semi-desert Karoo region in South Africa could hold a reserve of up to 450 trillion cubic feet. After initially imposing a moratorium on fracturing throughout South Africa, the South African government has recently changed track and is now intent on pursuing {{hydraulic fracturing}} and shale gas extraction in the Karoo. Arguably one of the main concerns with regards to hydraulic fracturing in the water scarce Karoo is that the fluids used to fracture rock formations can contain <b>chemical</b> <b>additives</b> that could contaminate scarce water resources and pose a risk to human health. In order to be in a better position to protect the environment and their health, members of the public need access to information on what <b>chemical</b> <b>additives</b> are used in fracturing operations. South Africa's access to information regime is primarily regulated in terms of the Promotion of Access to Information Act, 2000 which gives effect to the right to access to information in section 32 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. There is no guarantee that information on <b>chemical</b> <b>additives</b> will be disclosed or withheld as the Act allows companies to withhold information for a number of reasons, including that the information may constitute a trade secret or confidential commercial or technical information. In June 2015 South Africa adopted the Final Regulations for petroleum exploration and exploitation in terms of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, 2002. The Final Regulations include specific provisions on disclosure on <b>chemical</b> <b>additives.</b> However, the Final Regulations are riddled with uncertainty and loopholes that may seriously impede their ability to protect water resources from the <b>chemical</b> <b>additives</b> contained in fracturing fluids. As currently framed it is unclear whether or not information on <b>chemical</b> <b>additives</b> must be publically disclosed. Some lessons can be learned from regulatory experience in Canada in Alberta and British Columbia, for example the public disclosure of <b>chemical</b> <b>additives</b> on the website www. fracfocus. ca. However, a number of loopholes have undermined the effectiveness of regulation in Canada. The most prominent loophole is the fact that companies frequently withhold information on the chemicals they use on the basis that this information is a trade secret. The dissertation concludes that it cannot be said that South Africa's laws that regulate the disclosure of <b>chemical</b> <b>additives</b> will guarantee that fracturing will occur in a manner that is constituent with the right to an environment that is not detrimental to a person's health and wellbeing...|$|R
