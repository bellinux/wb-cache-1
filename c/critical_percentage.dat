To date, many molecular markers have been identified with a view to providing accurate and timely prediction of response to treatment and long-term survival. Proliferation remains a key feature of tumor progression, which has been widely estimated by the immunohistochemical use of the Ki- 67 nuclear antigen.

Seismic surface wave method of multi-channel analysis of surface wave (MASW) {{has been carried out}} in the model track and field track for finding out shear wave velocity of the clean and fouled ballast and track subsurface. The shear wave velocity (SWV) of fouled ballast increases with increase in fouling percentage, and reaches a maximum value and then decreases. This character is similar to typical compaction curve of soil, which is used to define optimum and <b>critical</b> fouling <b>percentage</b> (OFP and CFP). <b>Critical</b> fouling <b>percentage</b> of 15 % is noticed for Coal fouled ballast and 25 % is noticed for clayey sand fouled ballast. Coal fouled ballast reaches the OFP and CFP before clayey sand fouled ballast. Fouling of ballast reduces voids in ballast and there by decreases the drainage. Combined plot of permeability and SWV with percentage of fouling shows that after critical fouling point drainage condition of fouled ballast goes below acceptable limit. Shear wave velocities are measured in the selected location in the Wollongong field track by carrying out similar seismic survey. In-situ samples were collected and degrees of fouling were measured. Field SWV values are more than that of the model track SWV values for the same degree of fouling, which might be due to sleeper’s confinement.

Indian ballast contains a coarser particle size when compared to other countries.

40|$|This article aims {{to clarify}} why, and by which mechanisms, {{exercise}} {{may influence the}} normal menstrual cycle. Therefore, the vast amount of literature on this subject is reviewed and a critical appraisal of the most widespread hypotheses is offered. The strikingly low body mass which frequently accompanies exercise-related menstrual irregularities (ERMI) has led some authors to develop a hypothesis which postulates that a <b>critical</b> <b>percentage</b> of body fat is essential to trigger normal menstruation. The relevance of any reference to anorexia nervosa to support this view lacks consistency: female athletes differ in many ways from patients with anorexia nervosa, not lease in their excellent physical status which is essential to deliver first-class performances. ERMI is not identical to the so-called female athlete triad, a complicated pathology that involves ERMI, premature osteoporosis and disordered eating. ERMI itself {{does not seem to}} have any substantial pathological effects as long as attention is paid to preventing osteoporosis or stress fractures which may result from prolonged hypo-estrogenaemia. In the female athlete with ERMI who wishes to conceive, the accompanying subfertility may necessitate a response other than a prompt reduction in training intensity, as this is hardly a first choice for any top athlete. During recent years, a number of prospective studies have greatly contributed to our understanding of the complexity of the mechanisms involved in ERMI. Older hypotheses, such as those considering hyperprolactinaemia as the cornerstone of ERMI, have now been firmly rejected. The present hypotheses emphasi se the importance of caloric deficiency and limited energy availability, although they still fail to identify the actual mechanism that causes ERMI. There is, however, evidence that ERMI is produced by a disturbance of the hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing hormone oscillator. This disturbance is caused by either an insufficient estrogen or progesterone feedback or by an imbalance of local opioid peptide and catecholamine activities mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), corticotrophin-releasing hormone and insulin-like growth factor- 1. More recent experiments have also linked ERMI with changes in steroid metabolism, in particular, an increasing activity of catecholestrogens possibly leading to enhanced intracerebral noradrenaline (norepinephrine) levels that may interfere with normal gonadotrophin release. This article demonstrates that the outcome of the many studies on ERMI is characterised by much controversy and numerous methodological flaws.

Prairie) to {{establishment}} and maintenance P were investigated {{in a field}} trial on a moderately acid (pH 5. 25) high country (700 m a. s. l.) Yellow Brown Earth at Mesopotamia Station, South Canterbury. Results showed that lotus consistently outproduced white clover and T. ambiguum, especially at low and moderate P applications. Mean total dry matter exceeding 5 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ for the two Trifolium species and nearly 6 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ for lotus were recorded in the fourth year after establishment. Poor establishment, low plant population and unresponsiveness to applied P have resulted in T. ambiguum giving lowest yields in all P treatments. The greater productivity of lotus was associated with higher recovery of applied p from the soil. In terms of total and legume dry matter per unit P applied, lotus was the most efficient of the legumes. <b>Critical</b> <b>percentage</b> P for lotus (0. 25 - 0. 30 % P) appeared to be lower than white clover suggesting a lower 'internal functional requirement' for P in lotus. Lotus appeared {{to be capable of}} fixing as much N as white clover, but N transfer from lotus to the associated grasses was lower than from white clover. Nitrogen transfer from T. ambiguum was also inferior to white clover. Thus, grass dry matter yields were always highest when associated with white clover. In another field trial, the distribution of root activities of the three legumes was investigated by placements of carrier-free ³²P in the soil profile around two-year- old spaced planted plants. Results showed that both lotus and white clover root activities (approximately 75 % and 64 % respectively) were concentrated largely within the top 5 - 7 cm from the soil surface. However, lotus root activities extended over a greater distance laterally (12 cm or more) than white clover, thereby exploring a larger soil volume. Less than 50 % of T. ambiguum root activity was found in the surface horizon, and much of its toot activity (approximately 65 - 70 %) was confined to a radius of 5 cm around the plant. Since most of the applied P accumulated in the surface horizon, more than 90 % of the total P absorbed by each legume was derived from the surface soil horizon. The contribution of the subsoil to the overall P nutrition of the legumes was negligible. Phosphate responses and the efficiency of roots in P uptake (P absorbed per unit weight roots) in the legumes were also compared in solution culture experiments. Over a range of P concentrations (1 - 50 µM) lotus yields were significantly higher than the Trifolium species. Comparisons of the rate ³²P-labelled phosphate uptake showed lotus roots to be more efficient especially from very dilute external P solutions. Root length per unit root weight and percentage of absorbed P translocated to shoots did not differ significantly between lotus and white clover. Disruption of P supply (distilled water pre-treatment) prior to uptake experiment stimulated a greater increase in the proportion of absorbed p transferred to lotus shoots. Root length per unit weight for T. ambiguum was significantly shorter and root diameter larger than the other legumes. Efficiency of P uptake by T. ambiguum roots and translocation of absorbed P to the shoot was also inferior. The possible reasons for the differential growth responses between the three legumes were discussed in terms of: a) the efficiency of P recovery (percentage applied P recovered in herbage) which is a function of root architecture, root morphology and root cellular uptake mechanisms; b) the transfer of absorbed P to shoots and its subsequent utilization (P utilization quotients) for dry matter production. The potential for improving the efficiency of fertiliser usage through selection of P-efficient plant characters was briefly discussed. Suggestions were made for further research and assessment of lotus and T. ambiguum for hill country pasture development...|$|E

Elemental analysis performed on the gel provided a molecular composition ratio of [Pb(abd) (H 2 O) ]n (1).

40|$|AbstractAs a {{consequence}} of chemical hydrolysis of liposomal phospholipids {{the organization of the}} lipid assembly can change from a lamellar into a micellar system. Different approaches provided evidence for this conversion: 31 P-NMR analysis, turbidity measurements and ultracentrifugation experiments. Two conditions have to be met before this conversion can take place: (1) the liposomes must pass through a gel-to-liquid crystalline phase-transition during a heating or cooling run, and (2) the degree of chemical hydrolysis must exceed a <b>critical</b> hydrolysis <b>percentage</b> (or the phospholipid bilayer must contain critical amounts of lysophospholipid and fatty acid). As monitored by turbidity measurements, this critical level of hydrolysis and the relative change depended on the chain length and on the head group of the liposomal phospholipids. It does not depend on concentration, pH, storage temperature or on size of the liposomes within the experimental range. Addition of cholesterol to bilayers composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine prevents the lamellar to micellar transformation. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements of the lipophilic probe 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene in 0. 18 -μm dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (10 : 1) -liposomes indicated that behavior of the probe below and above the phase-transition temperature was not affected by chemical hydrolysis, or even by formation of micelles.

40|$|Biological {{materials}} such as spider silk display hierarchical structures, from nano to macro, effectively linking nanoscale constituents to larger-scale functional material properties. Here, we develop a model {{that is capable of}} determining the strength and toughness of elastic-plastic composites from the properties, percentages, and arrangement of its constituents, and of estimating the corresponding dissipated energy during damage progression, in crack-opening control. Specifically, we adopt a fiber bundle model approach with a hierarchical multiscale self-similar procedure which enables to span various orders of magnitude in size and to explicitly take into account the hierarchical topology of natural materials. Hierarchical architectures and self-consistent energy dissipation mechanisms (including plasticity), both omitted in common fiber bundle models, are fully considered in our model. By considering one of the toughest known materials today as an example application, a synthetic fiber composed of single-walled carbon nanotubes and polyvinyl alcohol gel, we compute strength and specific energy absorption values that are consistent with those experimentally observed. Our calculations are capable of predicting these values solely based on the properties of the constituent materials and knowledge of the structural multiscale topology. Due to the crack-opening control nature of the simulations, it is also possible to derive a <b>critical</b> minimal <b>percentage</b> of plastic component needed to avoid catastrophic behavior of the material.

40|$|Feedstock preparation, {{as well as}} its characterization, {{is crucial}} in the {{production}} of highly sintered parts with minimal defect. The hard metal powder - particularly, cemented carbide (WC-Co) used in this study was investigated both physically and thermally to determine its properties before the mixing and injection molding stage. Several analyses were conducted, such as scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray diffraction, pycnometer density, <b>critical</b> powder volume <b>percentage</b> (CPVP), as well as thermal tests, such as thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. On the basis of the CPVP value, the feedstock, consisting of WC-Co powder, was mixed with 60 % palm stearin and 40 % polyethylene at an optimal powder loading, within 2 to 5 % lower than the CPVP value. The CPVP spotted value was 65 %. The feedstock optimal value at 61 % showed good rheological properties (pseudoplastic behavior) with an n value lower than 1, considerably low activation energy and high moldability index. These preliminary properties of the feedstock serve as a benchmark in designing the schedule for the next whole steps (i. e. injection, debinding and sintering processes) ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} of feedstock characteristics for micro metal injection molding (ÂµMIM) is investigated by optimum power loading variation and rheological characterization. Due to the highly stringent characteristics of ÂµMIMâ€™s feedstock, the study has been emphasized on the powder and binder system in which stainless steel SS 316 L powder are mixed with composite binder, which consists of PEG (Polyethelena Glycol), PMMA (Polymethyl Methacrilate) and SA (Stearic Acid) by variation of powder loading concentration. The rheology properties are investigated using Shimadzu Flowtester CFT- 500 D capillary rheometer. The geometry of water atomised stainless steel powder are irregular shape, therefore it is expected {{significant changes in the}} rheological results that can influence the microcomponent, surface quality, shape retention and resolution capabilities. The optimization of the ÂµMIM rheological properties as a function of stainless steel powder loading concentration are evaluated by flow behavior exponent, activation energy and moldability index. Results show that 61. 5 %vol contributes a significant stability over a range of temperature and the best powder loading from a <b>critical</b> powder volume <b>percentage</b> (CPVP) and rheological point of vie...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe present {{two-dimensional}} numerical {{models of}} plate subduction and collision {{inspired by the}} Scandinavian Caledonian orogeny to investigate the possible impact of continental crust partial melting on the exhumation of ultra-high pressure metamorphic rocks. Three possible reactions were tested: low temperature solidus representing H 2 O-fluid-saturated partial melting, and two end-member reaction curves for dehydration melting. Thermo-mechanical effects of partial melting were implemented as (1) a viscosity decrease as a determined rheologically <b>critical</b> melt <b>percentage</b> was reached (here 0. 1), (2) a change in effective heat capacity and adiabatic heating/cooling accounting for a latent heat term in the heat equation. Among the 3 tested reactions, only H 2 O-fluid-saturated partial melting drastically modifies the collision dynamics from the non-melting reference model holding all other parameters constant. A substantially low general viscosity truncation (here 1017 Pa[*]s) is needed to properly resolve the effect of partial melting on deep collision processes. Low temperature melting indeed induces {{the development of a}} low viscosity buoyant plume prior to slab detachment, where migmatites exhume from UHP conditions at rates and with pressure–temperature paths similar to the natural values acknowledged for the Norwegian Caledonides. High temperature melting has no drastic influence on early collision dynamics. While positive buoyancy remains the first order driver for the exhumation of buried continental rocks, exhumation initiates in these cases with eduction subsequent to slab detachment. Melting and formation of a migmatite plume can later occur along decompression path while continental crust undergoes thermal reequilibration at temperatures above 900 [*]°C. Some of the partially molten material can also relaminate in the overriding plate rather than exhume within the collision zone. Even if minor in terms of amount of magma produced, H 2 O-fluid-saturated partial melting at UHP conditions could therefore have a dramatic rheological effect and actually limits continental rocks subduction and facilitates their exhumation...|$|R
40|$|International audience—Managing spatial {{reservoirs}} {{of malaria}} infection plays {{a crucial role}} in effective disease control. In this paper, a reservoir of infection refers to one or more interconnected subpopulations that sustain the epidemic {{at the level of the}} metapopulation to which applying a (linear) control strategy suffices to eradicate the disease in the whole system. We propose a numerical method to explain the steps for identifying reservoirs of malaria infection within n connected regions with the explicit movement of human population from the previous theoretical results in order to design an efficient computational tool. Furthermore, we determine the minimal <b>percentage</b> (<b>critical</b> vaccination fraction) of susceptible individuals in the reservoirs that should be protected to eliminate malaria. The costs and cost-effectiveness of malaria control interventions were analysed considering two strategies of control. (i) protecting the minimal fraction of susceptible individual; (ii) protecting any fraction greater than the minimal fraction. Cost-effectiveness analysis shows that the less cost and more effective strategy is to vaccinate (or protect) the minimal fraction of susceptible human in the reservoir of infection to halt outbreak. A numerical example provides insight into the efficiency of this approach...|$|R

40|$|Hydroxyapatite is a {{bioactive}} material. However, Hydroxyapatite {{in medical}} application {{is limited by}} its poor mechanical properties. Titanium alloys are biocompatible materials with high specific strength and high corrosion resistance. This combination can successfully be used in biomedical applications. The mixing process is a critical stage in the metal injection molding process because it determines {{the quality of the}} metal injection product. The homogeneity of the feedstock depends on the mixing parameters used during the mixing process. An experiment was conducted using Ti 6 Al 4 V and hydroxyapatite powder as feedstock at a mixing ratio of 60 : 40 wt%. This feedstock was mixed with a mixture of polyethylene and palm stearin as the binder. The mixing parameters used in this study were the mixing speed (10 and 30 rpm) and the mixing temperature (130 °C and 150 °C) at a powder loading of 67 %, as determined by the <b>critical</b> powder volume <b>percentage</b> experiment data (69. 5 %). Increases in the mixing speed and mixing temperature reduced the mixing time to achieve homogeneity. The combined feedstock achieved the highest density at a mixing speed of 30 rpm and a mixing temperature of 150 °C...|$|R
