40|$|The article {{discusses}} the reasons of specific cardiomyopathy {{in patients with}} pheochromocytoma and post operation lungs oedema. 106 pheochromocytoma patients were operated between 2004 and 2012 in Endocrine Research Center, 19 of them were investigated for ischemia myocardial changes. This cohort is divided into 2 groups: the first one includes 13 patients with preoperation notes of acute myocardial infarc tion (non Q developing), the second one consists of 6 patients with lung oedema in early postoperation time. All patients were operated after adequate preparation with α and βblockers. After clinical examina tion only 1 patient had conclusive ischemia, which required correction. Among reasons influencing a lung oedema (tumour size, manipulation time, age, sex, fluctuations of blood pressure) only the epinephrine type of tumor secretion was significant. Conclusion. Patients with adrenaline type secretion of pheochromocytoma have {{a higher risk of}} a lung oedema. The level of risk doesn’t depend on myocardial ischemia. Discussion. Possibility and necessity of administration of tyrozinkynase inhibitor (αmetylparatyrozine) or sensitisers of myocardial contraction (levosemindan) as the main means for preparation to a pheochromo <b>cytoma</b> surgery in epinephrinetype patients must be considered...|$|E
40|$|Background: The BCRP/ABCG 2 transporter, which mediates drug {{resistance}} in {{many types of}} cells, depends on energy provided by ATP hydrolysis. Here, a retrovirus encoding a shRNA targeting the ATP-binding domain of this protein was used to screen for highly efficient agents that could reverse {{drug resistance}} and improve cell sensitivity to drugs, thus laying the foundation for further studies and applications. Methodology/Principal Findings: To target the ATP-binding domain of BCRP/ABCG 2, pLenti 6 /BCRPsi shRNA recombinant retroviruses, with 20 bp target sequences starting from the 270 th, 745 th and 939 th bps of the 6 th exon, were constructed and packaged. The pLenti 6 /BCRPsi retroviruses (V-BCRPi) that conferred significant knockdown effects were screened using a drug-sensitivity experiment and flow cytometry. The human choriocarcinoma cell line JAR, which highly expresses endogenous BCRP/ABCG 2, was injected under the dorsal skin of a hairless mouse to initiate a JAR <b>cytoma.</b> After injecting V-BCRPi-infected JAR tumor cells into the dorsal skin of hairless mice, BCRP/ABCG 2 expression in the tumor tissue was determined using immunohistochemistry, fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. After intraperitoneal injection of BCRP/ABCG 2 -tolerant 5 -FU, the tumor volume, weight change, and apoptosis rate of the tumor tissue were determined using in situ hybridization.

40|$|Many {{reports were}} {{published}} about pheochromocytoma in these days, {{but there are}} still many problems to be solved as to the relation between the hypertensive symptom and the catecholamine value in patients with this <b>cytoma.</b> Recently the authors experienced a case of what is called asymptomatic pheochromocytoma in which the patient showed a significant increase in urinary and blood level of catecholamine, but blood pressure was normal at the time of admission. This 51 year-old woman visited this hospital with a complaint of a mass in the abdomen. Past history showed that she had been hospitalized for 2 months because of angina pectoris suspected 10 years ago and she was also pointed out to have enlarged gallbladder 7 years ago. Six months prior to admission she fell down with an attack of hypertention of 230 mmHg systolic, but her blood pressure was restored to normal in a'week. At that time her urine was positive for VMA and she had a slight headache several times a day. At the time of the present admission the patient had a mass palpated in the right hypochondria I region but no other symptom; blood pressure was 120 / 80; hematological and blood biochemical study showed no abnormality; but X-ray films showed a huge mass in the right posterior part of the peritoneal cavity, and the presence of a noradrenalin dominant pheochromocytoma was suggested. The mass removed was a simple cystoma of pheochromocytoma weighing 2, 832 g. The authors have considered through this case as follows: 1) Patients with pheochromocytoma have individual threshold values of susceptibility to catecholamine, and the interrelation between the individual variation of the threshold value and the amount of catecholamine secretion determines whether a patient has hypertention or only associated symptoms. 2) The so-called asymptomatic pheochromocytoma should rather be called pheochromocytoma ofthe normal blood pressure type, because it also causes various associated symptoms other than hypertention. Patients with pheochromocytoma may be of either the normal blood pressure type or of the hypertensive-type according to the amount of catecholamine secretion...|$|E
