5|$|Debian {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular Linux {{distributions}}, and many other distributions have been created from the Debian <b>codebase,</b> including Ubuntu and Knoppix. , DistroWatch lists 126 active Debian derivatives. The Debian project provides its derivatives with guidelines for best practices and encourages derivatives to merge their work back into Debian.|$|E
5|$|Dillon started DragonFly in {{the belief}} that the methods and {{techniques}} being adopted for threading and symmetric multiprocessing in FreeBSD 5 would lead to poor system performance and cause maintenance difficulties. He sought to correct these suspected problems within the FreeBSD project. Due to ongoing conflicts with other FreeBSD developers over the implementation of his ideas, his ability to directly change the FreeBSD <b>codebase</b> was eventually revoked. Despite this, the DragonFly BSD and FreeBSD projects still work together contributing bug fixes, driver updates, and other system improvements to each other.|$|E
5|$|More {{than three}} years after its digital launch, Fez {{received}} a physical release designed by Fish and limited to a signed edition of 500 in December 2015. The deluxe package included the soundtrack and a stylized red notebook with gold foil inlay. Though Bédard had moved on to another company, he continued {{to work on the}} game in secret. In August 2016, he released a final patch for the computer releases of Fez that included performance improvements, {{as a result of a}} unified <b>codebase</b> under an open source software library, and features such as a speedrun mode.|$|E
50|$|Note that <b>codebases</b> are {{different}} from individual servers, {{in the same way}} that a biological family/genus/species is different from a specific bird at a zoo or fossil imprint in a museum. Some of the <b>codebases</b> below are incredibly popular, with many servers based on them; other <b>codebases</b> may only be found on archive sites, making them available but effectively extinct. For a list of specific servers using some of these <b>codebases,</b> see the Chronology of MUDs article.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of an accurate driving behaviour, with different physics engines available, sets the project among the few open source racing simulation <b>codebases.</b>|$|R
5000|$|GFortran forked {{off from}} g95 in January 2003, which itself started in early 2000. The two <b>codebases</b> have [...] "significantly diverged" [...] {{according}} to GCC developers.|$|R
5|$|Initial {{development}} on WoA took place by porting code from Windows 7; Windows Mobile smartphones {{were used to}} test early builds of WoA {{because of lack of}} readily available ARM-based tablets. Later testing was performed using a custom-designed array of rack-mounted ARM-based systems. Changes to the Windows <b>codebase</b> were made to optimize the OS for the internal hardware of ARM devices, but a number of technical standards traditionally used by x86 systems are also used. WoA devices would use UEFI firmware, and have a software-based Trusted Platform Module to support device encryption and UEFI Secure Boot. ACPI is also used to detect and control plug and play devices and provide power management outside the SoC. To enable wider hardware support, peripherals such as human interface devices, storage and other components that use USB and I²C connections use class drivers and standardized protocols. Windows Update serves as the mechanism for updating all system drivers, software, and firmware.|$|E
5|$|Marco Pesenti Gritti, the {{initiator}} of Galeon, {{originally developed}} Epiphany in 2002 as a fork of Galeon. The fork occurred {{because of the}} divergent aims of Gritti {{and the rest of}} Galeon development team about new features. While Gritti regarded Galeon's monolithic design and the number of user-configurable features as factors limiting Galeon's maintainability and user base expansion, the rest of the Galeon developers wanted to see more features added. At the same time the GNOME project created the GNOME human interface guidelines, which promoted simplification of user interfaces. As Galeon was oriented towards power users, most developers saw the implementation of those guidelines as unacceptable. As a result, Gritti created a new browser based on Galeon's <b>codebase,</b> with most of the non-mission-critical features removed. He intended Epiphany to comply fully with the GNOME human interface guidelines, with a very simple user-interface. As such, Epiphany does not have its own theme settings and uses GNOME's settings, which are specified in the GNOME Control Center.|$|E

50|$|Historically, the Quake engine {{has been}} treated as a {{separate}} engine from its successor id Tech 2. The <b>codebases</b> for Quake and Quake II (id Tech 2) were separate GPL releases.|$|R
25|$|Only a {{few other}} {{security}} problems {{have been identified in}} the reference implementation of the NTP <b>codebase</b> in its 25+ year history, but the ones that have appeared recently are cause for significant concern. The protocol has been undergoing revision and review over its entire history. As of January 2011, there are no security revisions in the NTP specification and no reports at CERT. The current <b>codebase</b> for the reference implementation has been undergoing security audits from several sources for several years now, and there are no known high-risk vulnerabilities in the current released software.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft {{started work}} on Service Pack 2 soon after Service Pack 1 was released, as Windows Server 2008 {{uses the same}} <b>codebase</b> as Windows Vista Service Pack 1.|$|E
25|$|Production {{releases}} were branched from {{a snapshot}} of the development <b>codebase</b> (following a code freeze) and underwent a QA process that includes backporting security updates and bug fixes.|$|E
50|$|Notable AberMUDs include Northern Lights and Infinity. About twenty AberMUDs {{remain in}} operation, but even , they have few players. However, AberMUD's legacy {{lives on in}} the three major <b>codebases</b> it inspired: TinyMUD, LPMud and DikuMUD.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with its}} offshoots DOC has {{inspired}} {{at least four}} clone <b>codebases,</b> including YAWC, which is likely the oldest, Jammin (code), which has since become WeIrDo, bbs100 (which is licensed under GPL), and A better Citadel (ABC).|$|R

50|$|From 2004 until 2009 Saxon was {{available}} into two separate forms: Saxon-B and Saxon-SA. Both {{of these were}} built on similar <b>codebases.</b> Saxon-B was open-source software released under the Mozilla Public License, while Saxon-SA was a closed-source commercial product.|$|R
50|$|In October 2007, PWLib {{was renamed}} to PTLib. The OPAL and PTLib {{repositories}} were migrated to Subversion {{and maintenance of}} these <b>codebases</b> {{was moved to the}} SourceForge opalvoip project. A fork of OpenH323 called H323Plus was created {{at the same time and}} was moved to the SourceForge H323Plus project.|$|R
50|$|Red Hat creates, maintains, and {{contributes}} to many free software projects.

25|$|MuseScore was {{originally}} {{created as a}} fork of the MusE sequencer's <b>codebase.</b> At that time, MusE included notation capabilities and in 2002, Werner Schweer, one of the MusE developers, decided to remove notation support from MusE and fork the code into a stand-alone notation program. Since then, MuseScore has been under constant active development.|$|E
25|$|Embedded {{systems that}} have fixed {{deadlines}} use a real-time operating system such as VxWorks, PikeOS, eCos, QNX, MontaVista Linux and RTLinux. Windows CE is a real-time operating system that shares similar APIs to desktop Windows but shares none of desktop Windows' <b>codebase.</b> Symbian OS also has an RTOS kernel (EKA2) starting with version 8.0b.|$|E
25|$|Cedega – a {{proprietary}} fork of Wine by TransGaming Technologies, {{designed specifically for}} running Microsoft Windows games on Linux. A version of Cedega known as Cider allows Windows games to run on macOS.

50|$|The {{compiler}} {{was quite}} {{popular in the}} BBS scene, probably because of its OS/2 port and {{being one of the}} few affordable multi-target compilers. Also Turbo Pascal had been popular in the BBS scene too, but its successor, Delphi was suddenly for Windows only. Virtual Pascal provided a migration path for existing <b>codebases.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Infer uses a {{technique}} called bi-abductionto perform a compositional program analysis that interprets program procedures independently of their callers.
