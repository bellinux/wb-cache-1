25|$|To {{continue}} {{responding to}} the needs of people staying at the Ras Ajdir crossing point in Tunisia, the WFP and Secours Islamique-France were upgrading a kitchen that would provide breakfast for families. Separately, the ICRC advised it was handing over its operations at the Choucha Camp to the Tunisian Red Crescent. Since 24 March, the WFP supplied over 42,500 cooked meals for TCNs at the Saloum border. A total of 1,650 <b>cartons</b> <b>of</b> fortified date bars (equivalent of 13.2 metric tons) had also been provided to supplement these meals.|$|E
25|$|On March 5, 1966, Speck {{bought a}} 12-year-old car. The {{following}} evening, he burglarized a grocery store, stole 70 <b>cartons</b> <b>of</b> cigarettes, sold {{them out of}} the trunk of his car in the grocery store's parking lot, and then abandoned the car. The police traced the car to Speck and issued a warrant for his arrest for burglary on March 8. An arrest, his 42nd in Dallas, would mean another prison term, so on March 9, 1966, Speck's sister Carolyn drove him to the Dallas bus depot, where he caught a bus to Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
25|$|Commonly sold in gallon (3.78L), half-gallon (1.89L) and quart (0.94L) {{containers}} of natural-colored HDPE resin, or, for sizes {{less than one}} gallon, <b>cartons</b> <b>of</b> waxed paperboard. Bottles made of opaque PET are also becoming commonplace for smaller, particularly metric, sizes such as one liter. The US single-serving size is usually the half-pint (about 240 mL). Less frequently, dairies deliver milk directly to consumers, from coolers filled with glass bottles which are typically half-gallon sized and returned for reuse. Some convenience store chains in the United States (such as Kwik Trip in the Midwest) sell milk in half-gallon bags, while another rectangular cube gallon container design used for easy stacking in shipping and displaying is used by warehouse clubs such as Costco and Sam's Club, along with some Wal-Mart stores.|$|E

[...] The assortment of Lego food pieces in the grocery includes carrots, apples and bananas. There’s also a stairway to the apartment above, and a mailbox set with letters.|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} {{the first batch}} of originals in 1990, Yankovic focused his attention on parodies. By early 1991, only three parodies had been recorded. Two of them, the cookie-inspired New Kids on the Block parody [...] "The White Stuff" [...] and the television-centric MC Hammer parody [...] "I Can't Watch This," [...] were slated to be released as singles. In fact, several <b>cartons</b> <b>of</b> promo singles were pressed, but they were deleted from the record company's catalogue at the last minute. These CDs were later discovered by Yankovic and his drummer, Jon [...] "Bermuda" [...] Schwartz, in a trash heap and have since become collector's items. [...] "The Plumbing Song," [...] a double parody of Milli Vanilli's hit singles [...] "Baby Don't Forget My Number" [...] and [...] "Blame It on the Rain" [...] was also recorded. In a 1992 interview with Dr. Demento, Yankovic said that he believed the parody to be [...] "kind of redundant" [...] {{at that point in}} time, given the lip-synching scandal that had effectively destroyed the band almost two years prior. In reference to this scandal, Yankovic also jokingly affirmed that he did indeed sing lead vocals on his parody.|$|E

500|$|Celebrations {{coinciding with}} the {{birthday}} of Isabella II of Spain held in Havana, Cuba, on 10October were disrupted by heavy rains and strong winds, indicative of the hurricane's imminent arrival that evening. Following the storm's landfall, the most severe damage {{as a result of}} the storm was observed from eastern regions of Pinar del Río to western Matanzas. Already soaked by weeks of constant rainfall, with swollen rivers, inundated roads, and spoiled tobacco crops, existing problems were only further exacerbated; at Paso Real de San Diego, cassava, sweet potato, and other vianda harvests were ruined. In Havana proper, [...] waves battered ships seeking refuge in the city's harbor, grounded, driven away, capsized, and smashed, with much of their cargo, composing of <b>cartons</b> <b>of</b> sugar, bales of tobacco, and fragments of hemp, barrels, and cases strewn along the shore and sea. In all, the gale destroyed or seriously damaged 105commercial ships, 70sloops, pilot boats, and military craft, as well as 111other vessels at sea; as a result, shortages of many essential goods occurred in inland provinces. Damage in Cuban port cities was only further aggravated by the amount of debris produced by the destruction of ships, warehouses, and docks, which were in turn blown into harborside structures by powerful gusts.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequence}} of Bart crashing down the stairwell to the Mafia bar {{is similar to}} a scene in the film GoodFellas, in which a young boy is employed by a Mafia as their messenger. All of the horses in the race that Bart bets on are named after a famous animated character's catchphrase: [...] "Ain't I a Stinker?" [...] (Bugs Bunny), [...] "Yabba Dabba Doo" [...] (Fred Flintstone), [...] "Sufferin' Succotash" [...] (Sylvester), [...] "That's All Folks" [...] (Porky Pig), [...] "I Yam What I Yam" [...] (Popeye), and Bart's catchphrases [...] "Eat my shorts" [...] and [...] "Don't have a cow". The Chiffons's song [...] "One Fine Day" [...] is heard when Bart serves drinks to the mobsters during a game of poker. The writers originally wanted to use the song [...] "Be My Baby" [...] by The Ronettes for the scene, but they could not clear the copyrights for it. In his room, Bart stores the Springfield Mafia's loot—a truckload of <b>cartons</b> <b>of</b> Laramie cigarettes. While strutting around the kitchen, he sings Frank Sinatra's song [...] "Witchcraft". The scene in which Bart wakes up screaming after having a nightmare about Skinner is a reference to a scene in the 1972 film The Godfather, in which Jack Woltz screams after waking up in bed and finding a decapitated horse head by his side. Skinner frees himself from being trapped under the newspapers in a way similar to the character Angus MacGyver's escapes in the American television series MacGyver.|$|E

2500|$|On March 26, Butch {{was greeted}} at Pearl Harbor by {{a horde of}} reporters and radio announcers.

Ecstatic Grumman workers had passed the hat to buy the cigarettes in appreciation of O'Hare's combat victories in one of their F4F Wildcats. A loyal Camel smoker, Butch opened a carton, deciding that it was the least he could do for the good people back in Bethpage. In his letter to the Grumman employees he wrote, [...] "You build them, we'll fly them and between us, we can't be beaten."
