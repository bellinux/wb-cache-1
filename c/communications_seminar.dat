PNL`s Applied Technologies Communication (ATC) section of the Technical Information and Communications Department (TI&CD) hosted the half-day Quest for Quality seminar, which covered such topics as document design, site-wide production standards, and ``reinventing government. `` The seminar was {{the first of its kind}} to include technical communications professionals from all Hanford Site contractors; attendees included technical editors and writers, publications assistants, text processors, and document production staff. A complete list of the attendees is included as Appendix A and the presenters are listed in Appendix B. Five Hanford contractors have technical communications staffs, all trying to meet the needs of one primary customer: the US Department of Energy (DOE). Historically, these contractors have maintained different processes and standards with regard to document production, and little interaction or information sharing has occurred. To begin remedying that situation, PNL invited technical communicators across the Hanford Site to attend the first Quest for Quality Technical <b>Communications</b> <b>Seminar.</b> The purpose of the seminar was to identify ways to improve the quality of Hanford`s communication products and processes and to strengthen ties among technical communications staffs at the site.

5000|$|Pending graduation, he had {{enlisted in}} the British Army's Signal Corps Officer Training Corps, but when he {{reported}} for duty in 1946, he was [...] "demobbed" [...] along with other World War II servicemen. However, this brief contact {{with the world of}} radio electronics stimulated an interest in that field that flowed naturally into his later studies of the Civil <b>Communications</b> Section <b>seminars.</b> These post-war seminars were designed by the American occupation for Japanese electronics manufacturers, as there was a considerable need to keep the Japanese population informed of America's postwar reconstruction efforts there. Mr Hopper also observed that innovations such as radar, penicillin, and the jet engine came from English inventors, but each of these was turned to another nation, often America, for manufacturing. This was blatantly obvious during the war when fleets of merchant vessels had to be employed to bring parts back to Great Britain that could have been made on the island kingdom, a tragic story of submarine warfare that Hopper heard from P&G's principle fitter. Radar's refinement from a non-directional to a directional scanning device, for instance, came from the Bell Laboratories of Summit, New Jersey, USA. So, Mr. Hopper entered the manufacturing phase of his career with a keen awareness of the need for understanding how industries evolved innovative practices.|$|R

The duration of each edition of the seminar is one or even two semester terms and it consists on the cooperation between two national student teams (German and Spanish) in order to study an industrial problem for a German company. The students composed an international team and {{were in charge of}} different aspects of a given problem. Trips in both ways between Germany and Spain give opportunity to put in common the work of the groups. The seminar finished with a presentation of the students’ work and its results to the company engineers.

The model chosen for the purposes o f this study was the Work Discussion Seminar, based on a model developed at the Tavistock Clinic in London. Six subjects, all educate workers running their own creches, were recruited. Five out o f the six participants belonged to the Impilo Pilot Project, an action research project launched by the Gauteng Department o f Education in 1997. The subjects took part in six Work Discussion Seminars once a week, for six weeks. Discussions focused upon the behaviour and inner preoccupations o f various children, as well as on the conscious and unconscious responses o f the workers to these children’s <b>communications.</b> The <b>seminars</b> were based upon, the view that caregivers of young children need nurture and understanding themselves, in order to fulfil the demanding role of child rearing.

40|$|Since in {{the fifties}} Armand V. Feigenbaum coined the {{expression}} TQC (Total Quality Control) to name a quality management system that would involved not just the Quality Control department but also Marketing, Design, Engineering, Purchasing and Manufacturing, in order to guarantee {{the quality of the}} product along its life, different concepts and interpretations of its significance have been named TQC, which nowadays is called TQM (Total Quality Management). @@ The researching work has been carried out based upon the different Total Quality models used at present in the Industry all over the world in order to: clarify the "Total Quality" term, classify those models, determine characteristics and principles held in common between all of them, establish its relationship with the business management and systematize different implantation alternatives of these models among the organizations, particularizing finally this study in the Basque Country industry. @@ During the five years devoted to this investigation, in which more than 10 researchers of LABEIN have collaborated, several sources were used. Among them can be cited the following ones: bibliographical analysis (books, articles from specialized magazines, doctoral research thesis, <b>communications,</b> <b>seminars,</b> web pages, etc.); meetings with more than 500 professionals and combined works carried out with prestigious international organizations such as JUSE (Japan), GOAL/QPC (USA) or ITESM (Mexico). @@ The work starts from a historical walk through the evolution of the quality concept where it is clear the need to distinguish three levels or stages on which Companies tackle this subject: product level or service level concerning quality control; process level or system level associated to quality assurance and, the management level, associated to Total Quality. For the two first levels the standard offers a common language accepted by the Industry, being in the third level where an endless list of models everyone presented as the Total Quality panacea, has caused certain confusion and controversy. @@ The detailed analysis of more than a hundred different models has allowed to carry out a first classification of these Total Quality models into two big groups attending to their purpose: "reference models" (which indicate what but no how) and "introduction models" (they are centred on how), thinking also in other classifications depending on their sources and contents. In addition it is established the existence of nine characteristics or elements in common to all of them: customers focus; leadership; decision based upon the analysis of facts and data; process management; people"s participation and development; product and service quality assurance; integration of suppliers into the chain of value; analysis of results at short, medium and long term and, philosophy of continuous improvement in every activity of the Organization. Concerning this aspect it is deduced the convenience of taking as reference model, so much for analysis and investigation as for promotion, diffusion or evaluation, any of the three best quality awards which are the following: Deming (Japan) Baldrige (USA), EFQM (EU), and more specifically for the Basque Country the last one. @@ The researching work gives a comparative study between the Total Quality models, represented by the EFQM, and the " 7 s" business management model of Waterman & Peters, confirming that Total Quality models named of second generation against partial models or of first generation, form real distinguished strategies of business management being able to consider the EQFM model as a model for "quality evaluation of business management". This work also includes the problems arising when implementing these models into the Industry where, besides the most traditional lines of ISO 9000 or constant improvement, other ways are proposed such as the poor structured self evaluation way, and others better structured such as the JUSE methodology used in Japan and its area of influence. @@ Finally, the situation and future prospects in the Basque Country are analyzed taking into account several action programmes, basically from the Basque Government, through out drive Enterprises and Associations and from the Diputación Foral de Bizkaia (local administation) more approached to the SMEs (Small & Midum Enterprise) and micro-SMEs of this historical territory, as well as from different organizations acting within the framework of quality promotion and diffusio...|$|R
