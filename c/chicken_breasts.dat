25|$|The {{hotel has}} two {{well-known}} restaurants: the Grill Room (usually {{known as the}} Savoy Grill), {{on the north side}} of the building, with its entrance off the Strand, and the Savoy Restaurant (formerly known as the River Restaurant, now named Kaspars), on the south side, overlooking the River Thames. The latter has long been famous for its inventive chefs, beginning in 1890, with the celebrity chef Auguste Escoffier. Escoffier created many famous dishes at the Savoy. In 1893, he invented the pêche Melba in honour of the Australian singer Nellie Melba, and in 1897, Melba toast. Other Escoffier creations were bombe Néro (a flaming ice), fraises à la Sarah Bernhardt (strawberries with pineapple and Curaçao sorbet), baisers de Vierge (meringue with vanilla cream and crystallised white rose and violet petals) and suprêmes de volailles Jeannette (jellied <b>chicken</b> <b>breasts</b> with foie gras). Another signature dish is the Omelette Arnold Bennett.|$|E

Notably, hummus bi tahini, [...] mukhluta, sometimes nearly a dozen variations of eggplant salad, tabbouleh, fattoush, chili pepper and red cabbage salads and dishes made up by the chef are served. Kibbee balls and sfiha are the primary hot appetizers available. Heavy meals are rarely provided by restaurants, instead however, the entrées include shish kebab, shish taouk, rack of lamb and <b>chicken</b> <b>breasts.</b> Falafel shops or Mahal falafel offer mainly falafel and shawarma with several different contents. They also offer hummus or tabbouleh to be served with the meal.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the}} effects of the mixing ratio between pork loin and <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> for textural and sensory properties of emulsion sausages. Meat homogenates are prepared by using five mixing ratios between pork loin and <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> (100 : 0, 70 : 30, 50 : 50, 30 : 70, and 0 : 100), and the emulsion sausages are also formulated with five mixing ratios. The additions of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> increase the salt soluble protein solubility due to high pH levels of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast,</b> thereby resulting in the reduction of cooking losses. In addition, the apparent viscosity of meat homogenates increase with increas-ing amounts of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast.</b> In terms of emulsion sausages formulated with pork loin and <b>chicken</b> <b>breast,</b> the addition of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> above 50 % may contribute to a softer and more flexible texture of emulsion sausages. For sensory evalua-tions, an increase in the added amount of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> contributes to a rich umami taste and deeper flavor within the emul-sion sausages, resulting in the high overall acceptance score for the formulation of 0 - 30 % pork loin and 70 - 100 % <b>chicken</b> <b>breast.</b> Therefore, the optimal mixing ratios between pork loin and <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> are 0 - 30 % and 70 - 100 % for enhancing the textural and sensory properties of emulsion sausages.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the effects of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat {{on the quality of}} mackerel sausages. The mackerel sausages were manufactured by additions of 5 %, 7 %, and 10 % of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat. The lightness of mackerel sausages showed {{no significant differences between the}} control and addition groups. The redness increased in a dose-dependent man-ner, but the yellowness decreased significantly with the addition of 7 % <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat (p< 0. 05). The whiteness value of mackerel sausage added with 7 % <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat was significantly higher than those of the other groups (p< 0. 05). In texture analysis, the hardness and adhesiveness of the mackerel sausage added with 5 % of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat showed no significant differences as compared to the control. However, the mackerel sausages added with 7 % and 10 % of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat showed a dose-dependent decrease. The gel strength of the mackerel sausage added with 5 % <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat was not significantly different from the control, but the addition of 7 % and 10 % <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat reduced the gel strength of the mackerel sausage. In sensory evaluation, the mackerel sausages prepared with <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat have higher scores in smell, taste, texture, hardness, chewiness, and overall preference as compared to the no addition group. Therefore, these results suggest that the optimal condition for improving the properties within mackerel sausages was 5 % addition of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> meat.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{disseminate}} knowledge regarding the perceptions of Spanish consumers of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> and their related lifestyles and to classify different consumer groups according to their food-related lifestyles. Nearly all Spanish consumers consume <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> once or twice per week. The preference for white or yellow chicken appears to be divided evenly, although the preferred is white <b>chicken.</b> <b>Chicken</b> <b>breast</b> is perceived as a product of convenience. Seventy percent of consumers buy <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> because it is easy to cook whereas only 27 % prefer to buy the entire chicken. Four groups of consumers based on their lifestyles and their perceptions of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> were identified: “Urban single”, “Traditional”, “Innovative precariat ” and “Gourmet”. These types of consumers are consistent with types other studies have identified in terms of the lifestyles associated with other foods. Defining groups of consumers with differentiated perceptions of <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> is useful in managing marketing strategies to satisfy the various consumption needs associated with <b>chicken</b> <b>breast...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The French term de volaille means {{literally}} [...] "of poultry" [...] but denotes {{almost exclusively}} chicken dishes in French cookbooks. The name côtelette de volaille means thus simply [...] "chicken cutlet". Despite the original French name, the Russian recipe is unknown in French cuisine, where the term côtelette de volaille refers to <b>chicken</b> <b>breasts</b> {{in general and}} is used nearly synonymously with chicken fillet or suprême. The French term also denotes a minced chicken cutlet-shaped patty. The general Russian term for chicken cutlets, kurinaya kotleta (куриная котлета), refers predominantly to minced cutlets, whereas kotleta de-voliay is applied exclusively to the stuffed chicken breast dish. The latter name appears in the pre- and post-revolutionary Russian literature (in cookbooks {{as well as in}} fiction) {{since the beginning of the}} 20th century and is usually mentioned as a common restaurant dish.|$|E
2500|$|The term à la Maréchale ("marshal-style") denotes in French cookery tender {{pieces of}} meat, such as cutlets, escalopes, sweetbreads, or <b>chicken</b> <b>breasts,</b> which are treated à l'anglaise ("English-style"), i.e. coated with eggs and breadcrumbs, and sautéed. Numerous recipes of such dishes, {{some of them}} with stuffings, are {{described}} both in Western and Russian cookbooks of the 19th century. Among the stuffed versions, on finds a recipe for a [...] "fowl fillet à la Maréchale" [...] stuffed with truffles and herbs in The Art of French Cuisine of the 19th Century (1847) by Marie-Antoine Carême, and a similar filet de poulets à la Maréchale with herbs and forcemeat in La cuisine classique (1868) by Urbain Dubois. Elena Molokhovets' A Gift to Young Housewives, the most successful Russian cookbook of the 19th century, has included since its first edition in 1861 an elaborate recipe for [...] "hazel grouse à la Maréchale" [...] stuffed with madeira sauce, portobello mushrooms and truffles.|$|E

40|$|<b>Chicken</b> <b>breast</b> {{was more}} {{resistant}} to various exogenous oxidative factors than beef loin: addition of NaCl did not increase TBARS values and nonheme content of raw <b>chicken</b> <b>breast,</b> but significantly increased those of raw beef loin patties during storage. Addition of NaCl+Mb did not affect lipid oxidation in raw <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> patties, but decreased the TBARS of beef loin during storage. Addition of NaCl+Fe(III) or NaCl+Fe(II) increased the TBARS values of both raw <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> and beef loin during storage, but the increase was greater in beef loin than in <b>chicken</b> <b>breast.</b> The TBARS values of all cooked <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> and beef loin increased during 7 -day storage, but the increases in cooked chicken patties were significantly smaller than those of cooked beef loin patties with the same treatments. Addition of NaCl and cooking caused severe degradation of myoglobin, leading to {{a significant increase in}} free ionic iron content in beef loin. It is suggested that free ionic iron is the major catalyst for lipid oxidation, and the high “storage-stable” ferric ionic reducing capacity and “heat-stable” ferric ion reducing capacity in <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> were responsible for the high oxidative stability for raw and cooked <b>chicken</b> <b>breast</b> compared with beef loin under prooxidants, cooking and storage conditions...|$|R
