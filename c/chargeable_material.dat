40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{methodology}} for processing frequency do-main EM data {{to identify the}} presence of IP effects in observa-tions of the magnetic fields arising from an inductive source. The method makes used of the asymptotic behaviour of the imaginary part of secondary magnetic fields at low frequency. A new quantity, {{referred to as the}} ISIP datum, is defined so that it equals zero at low frequencies for any frequency-independent (non-chargeable) conductivity distribution. Thus any non-zero response in the ISIP data indicates the presence of <b>chargeable</b> <b>material.</b> Once the data are defined, the change in the real component of the resistivity, which is indicative of chargeability, is obtained by solving a linear inverse problem...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of this thesis, a new two-dimensional inversion algorithm for direct current (DC) resistivity and time-domain induced polarization (IP) data was developed. The algorithm consists of a novel composition of finite element forward calculation and a smoothness constrained local regularization inversion approach including error weighting and a non-linear IP chargeability inversion. All forward and inverse calculations are conducted on unstructured triangular meshes. The advantage of employing an unstructured mesh {{over the use of}} structured grids is that complicated surface topography can easily be implemented and complex subsurface structures can be reproduced better. This is among other things due to flexibility and because local mesh refinement is possible without globally increasing the number of elements significantly. An IP perturbation model is implemented that explains the effect of <b>chargeable</b> <b>material</b> by an increase of effective resistivity. Consequently, the inversion is conducted in two steps. The first step is a non-linear DC inversion recovering a resistivity model that corresponds to the effective resistivity and explains the measured DC data within the error bounds. In the second step, a chargeability model is derived by non-linear IP inversion. The employment of unstructured grids pleads for special smoothness constraints because model elements are not arranged in a regular manner and are oriented arbitrarily. Therefore, three types of smoothness matrices are examined that approximate first order derivatives in the triangular mesh. Furthermore, a measure of the depth of investigation is presented that is based on the normalized coverage which is a cumulative sensitivity. A coverage threshold applicable for 2 D models is derived by the coverage value of a homogeneous model that corresponds to the depth of investigation according to a rule of thumb. The accuracy of the implemented forward algorithm is verified by modeling of 1 D and 2 D models and comparison to analytical solutions. By inversion of synthetic data, it is assessed whether the algorithm can reproduce the original models. Reliability is also checked by comparison of the forward and inverse modeling of synthetic data with established algorithms. The new algorithm was successfully applied to DC and time-domain IP field data acquired on a copper ore deposit in Elbistan, Turkey. Due to the state of the ore deposit, which is mainly disseminated, it was expected that the presence of the metallic particles does not produce a prominent resistivity anomaly. Thus, the deposit is difficult to detect with the DC resistivity method alone. However, the assumed sulfide content leads to strong induced polarization effects. These assumptions are confirmed by the resistivity and chargeability models obtained by inversion with the new algorithm. As expected, highly chargeable structures with more than 100 mV/V are recovered that are associated with the ore deposit, while the outline is not clearly distinguishable in the resistivity models. Comparison with inversion results obtained by other algorithms and a near surface resistivity model derived from Radiomagnetotelluric data confirm the resistivity and chargeability results of the new algorithm...|$|E
50|$|Many countries, {{including}} India, France and Germany, have underground {{deposits of}} iron ore in dust form (blue dust). Such iron ore cannot be directly charged in a blast furnace. In the early 20th century, sinter technology {{was developed for}} converting ore fines into lumpy <b>material</b> <b>chargeable</b> in blast furnaces. Sinter technology took 30 years to gain acceptance in the iron-making domain, but now plays an important role. Initially developed to generate steel, {{it is now a}} means of using metallurgical waste generated in steel plants to enhance blast furnace operation and reducing waste. The largest sinter plant is located in Chennai, India, and employs 10,000 people.|$|R
