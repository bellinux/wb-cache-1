The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the performance of HPV Direct <b>Flow</b> <b>CHIP</b> in the analysis of 947 samples from routine cervical screening or the follow-up of abnormal Pap smears. The specimens were dry swab samples, liquid-based cytology samples, or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. The genotype distribution was in agreement with known epidemiological data for the Spanish population. Three different subgroups of the samples were also tested by Linear Array (LA) HPV Genotyping Test (n= 108), CLART HPV 2 (n= 82), or Digene Hybrid Capture 2 (HC 2) HPV DNA Test (n= 101). HPV positivity was 73. 6 % by HPV Direct <b>Flow</b> <b>CHIP</b> versus 67 % by LA, 65. 9 % by HPV Direct <b>Flow</b> <b>CHIP</b> versus 59. 8 % by CLART, and 62. 4 % by HPV Direct <b>Flow</b> <b>CHIP</b> versus 42. 6 % by HC 2. HPV Direct <b>Flow</b> <b>CHIP</b> showed a positive agreement of 88. 6 % with LA (k= 0. 798), 87. 3 % with CLART (k= 0. 818), and 68. 2 % with HC 2 (k= 0. 618). In conclusion, HPV Direct <b>Flow</b> <b>CHIP</b> results were comparable with those of the other methods tested. Although further investigation is needed to compare the performance of this new test with a gold-standard reference method, these preliminary findings evidence the potential value of HPV Direct <b>Flow</b> <b>CHIP</b> in HPV vaccinology and epidemiology studies...|$|R

Two means of calculating the mass flow were used: the first being an impact sensor to measure total mass flow, and the second a volumetric approach based on measuring total area occupied by wood in images generated using the capacitance sensor’s tomographic mode. Tests were made on 109 groups of wood chips ranging in moisture content from 14 % to 120 % (dry basis) and wet weight of 280 to 1100 g. Sixty groups were randomly selected as a calibration set, and the remaining were used for validation of the sensor’s performance. For the combined capacitance/force transducer system, root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEP) for wet mass flow and moisture content were 13. 42 % and 16. 61 %, respectively. RMSEP using the combined volumetric mass flow/capacitance sensor for dry mass flow and moisture content were 22. 89 % and 24. 16 %, respectively. Either of the approaches was concluded to be feasible for prediction of moisture content in pine <b>chip</b> <b>flows,</b> but combining the impact and capacitance sensors was easier to implement.

5000|$|Under normal usage, swarf {{is carried}} {{up and away}} from the tip of the drill bit by the fluting of the drill bit. The cutting edges produce more chips which {{continue}} the movement of the chips outwards from the hole. This is successful until the chips pack too tightly, either because of deeper than normal holes or insufficient backing off (removing the drill slightly or totally from the hole while drilling). Cutting fluid is sometimes used to ease this problem and to prolong the tool's life by cooling and lubricating the tip and <b>chip</b> <b>flow.</b> Coolant may be introduced via holes through the drill shank, which is common when using a gun drill. When cutting aluminum in particular, cutting fluid helps ensure a smooth and accurate hole while preventing the metal from grabbing the drill bit in the process of drilling the hole. When cutting brass, and other soft metals that can grab the drill bit and causes [...] "chatter", a face of approx. 1-2 millimeters can be ground on the cutting edge to create an obtuse angle of 91 to 93 degrees. This prevents [...] "chatter" [...] during which the drill tears rather than cuts the metal. However, with that shape of bit cutting edge, the drill is pushing the metal away, rather than grabbing the metal. This creates high friction and very hot swarf.For heavy feeds and comparatively deep holes oil-hole drills are used in the drill bit, with a lubricant pumped to the drill head through a small hole in the bit and flowing out along the fluting. A conventional drill press arrangement can be used in oil-hole drilling, but it is more commonly seen in automatic drilling machinery in which it is the workpiece that rotates rather than the drill bit.|$|E

The Saeman model is classically used to predict the mean residence time (MRT) and the bed depth profile of powder materials in rotary kilns. Its ability to describe wood <b>chips</b> <b>flow</b> arises. In the present study, residence time distribution (RTD) experiments are conducted with raw and torrefied wood chips.

A plug flow with small extent of dispersion is emphasized, even if some segregation phenomena are highlighted. Torrefaction did not evidence any significant influence on the flow pattern. With a discrepancy of 20 % between the measured and computed mean residence time, the predictive capacity of the classical Seaman model proved to be insufficient.

To select {{reasonable}} cutting parameters, {{improve the}} processing surface quality, {{and extend the}} tool life, this paper uses four solid carbide end milling tools to process TC 4 titanium alloy, and analyses {{the influence of the}} difference cutting parameters and the geometric angles to chip shape. The experiment results indicate that the degree of serrated chip shape is increased by increasing the feed rate under the condition of certain spindle speed. But the degree of serrated chip shape may be decreased by the adoption of small axial and radial depth, or bigger rake angle and smaller helix angle. Select larger rake angle, cutting edge is sharp, the metal deformation of cutting layer is small, which can reduce the friction force when <b>chip</b> <b>flowing</b> through the tool rake face, so that the cutting force and cutting temperature decreases accordingly. The greater the helix angle is, the worse the chip removal conditions is, and the degree of serrated chip becomes larger, the blade is more sharp, easily crack, and the tool life decreases.
