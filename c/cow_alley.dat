40|$|Housing {{criteria}} {{should be}} based around the fundamental concept that “the housing should be adapted {{to meet the needs}} of the animal and NOT the adaptation of the animal {{to meet the needs of}} the building”. In practice this means housing conditions that meet the needs of the animals in terms of their social behaviour, eg subdominant animals must have the opportunity to withdraw or avoid higher status animals. This may mean greater space at feeding and watering sites greater space per <b>cow</b> <b>alley</b> widths sufficiently wide to allow free passage and the avoidance of dead ends. Good husbandry skills and herd stability are also important. (3 rd NAHWOA Workshop 2002) In order to achieve these criteria there are two areas under consideration, improvements to the existing sheds to house the spring calving herd and a new building for the autumn calving herd. Objectives: To investigate ways of improving existing cattle sheds. To confirm the site of the new cattle buildin...|$|E
40|$|Flushing {{characteristics}} of a tower tank valve flushing system with a 12 -inch-diameter manual valve were determined. Data were obtained using the outside <b>cow</b> <b>alleys</b> in a fourrow freestall barn. The alleys were 12 ft wide and 420 ft long with a 2 % slope. The average flow rate exceeded 8, 000 gallons per minute (gpm) when the average head was above 30 ft and the manual valve opened 80 degrees. Opening the valve to 90 degrees increased the flow rate to over 9, 700 gpm. The velocity of the flushing wave was 8. 5 fpm with a flow depth of 3. 5 in. The estimated wave duration or alley contact time was 14. 6 sec with a 25 - 40 sec release time from the flush tank. The flow rate ranged from 5, 300 gpm to 7, 200 gpm when the average head was between 16 and 28 ft...|$|R
40|$|Improving cow comfort {{has been}} shown to provide large {{increases}} in milk yield, cow health and reduced cull rates of underproducing cows. Over the years animal size has increased and confinement systems have evolved so that many producers have to decide if remodeling their freestalls can improve cow comfort and reduce undue cull rates thus increasing their bottom line. Cushion: Improving the cushion in cows laying area can improve the comfort of the animal. Producers have several alternatives to explore such as, deep bedded sand, sand over a matt or concrete, deep bedded organic bedding, mats or mattresses with more cushion, and recycled manure solids. Each deep bedded sand stall may use about seven to nine tons of sand a year. This option is very cow friendly as hock lesions almost disappear. Sand is groomed daily and sand in the <b>cow</b> <b>alleys</b> improves traction and the improved footing reduces slipping when cows show estrus. The drawback is the manure handling becomes more difficult and expensive. If you have good stall dimensions. a bedding keeper or sand over a mattress could improve cushion with less sand cost and little remodeling. Another option some pick is to purchase a mat with more cushion under the harder rubber top. These mats require little remodeling but producers should remember that raising the platform a couple of inches might decrease comfort unless you raise the neck rail. Using recycled sand or manure solids increases cow comfort but require a major investment in structure and management time and resources. Both sand and manure solids will need to sit and drain moisture or heat and kill bacteria. Given an increase of pathogens to the udder with these systems producers must decide if they will invest their time and ability to meet the increased demands. Stall Dimensions: Over time cows have been bred to be larger which sometimes puts them in stalls that were developed for smaller cows. New stall width and length recommendations {{can be found in the}} following chart...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to study {{influence}} of different flooring systems on several aspects of locomotion of dairy cows. To assess the gait on different floors, trackway analysis was used. Cows walking on a hard, slippery surface had shorter strides, wider posture and asymmetric steps. A hard, slippery surface resulted in stride shortening, wider posture and asymmetric gait. Using soft rubber mats made gait patterns more similar to those on a natural yielding surface such as sand. When cows with moderate lameness walked on yielding surfaces their gait parameters associated with lameness were less pronounced than on hard concrete surfaces. Preference studies showed {{that the majority of}} cows preferred to walk and stand on soft rubber flooring rather than on concrete flooring. However, lame cows within the group did not show a stronger preference to walk on soft flooring than non-lame cows, presumably due to lower social rank compared to healthy herd mates. In order to assess the effects of long-term exposure to flooring systems differing in hardness and abrasiveness installed in the walking and standing areas an experimental study was carried out. Claw conformation, claw horn growth and wear rates, as well as static weight and pressure distribution were evaluated. On a rougher flooring (mastic asphalt), exaggerated wear, highest growth rate and a loss of sole concavity was seen, and most weight was exerted to the sole area of the claws. When rubber-equipped feed-stalls were used together with mastic asphalt in <b>alleys</b> <b>cows</b> showed reduced wear, positive net growth and reduced loss of the concavity compared to cows housed on asphalt alley surfaces. In comparison with asphalt flooring, rubber mats on the alleys resulted in lower growth and wear rates, increased net growth, preserved sole concavity and the bulb and wall area of the claw carried the most weight. Rubber mats together with little exposure to an abrasive asphalt surface resulted in claw horn net growth rates similar to that observed on aged, low abrasive concrete slatted floor. It was concluded that soft flooring provides good locomotion comfort for dairy cows but a moderate abrasion is also required to prevent claw overgrowth...|$|R
