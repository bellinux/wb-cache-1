2500|$|Electricity retailers, who in {{aggregate}} buy from the wholesale market, and generators who {{in aggregate}} {{sell to the}} wholesale market, are exposed to these price and volume effects and {{to protect themselves from}} volatility, they will enter into [...] "hedge contracts" [...] with each other. The structure of these contracts varies by regional market due to different conventions and market structures. However, the two simplest and most common forms are simple fixed price forward contracts for physical delivery and <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>differences</b> where the parties agree a strike price for defined time periods. In the case of a contract for difference, if a resulting wholesale price index (as referenced in the contract) in any time period is higher than the [...] "strike" [...] price, the generator will refund the difference between the [...] "strike" [...] price and the actual price for that period.

Provided, therefore, that methane injected into the grid has had its anthropogenic carbon emissions offset at source {{by the use of}} either biogenic fuels, CCS or a combination of both, such methane will comply with the terms of The Energy Act, and generators burning such gas to produce low carbon electricity will be eligible for support by <b>Contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>Differences.</b> DECC has confirmed that such a scheme is eligible for support by CfD.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{exposure}} is to market risk as the warrant will be profitable {{only when the}} market price exceeds the strike price for a [...] "call warrant" [...] or is below the strike for a [...] "put warrant". The inherent leveraging effect of the warrant significantly increases the risks and traders that are using warrant to speculate can make or lose significant sums very quickly. With covered warrants the maximum loss {{is limited to the}} price paid for the warrant (ask or offer price) plus any commission or other transaction charges. Thus, although warrants are classed as high risk they are not as risky as other investment products such as <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>differences</b> or spread betting in which an investor would have to pay for future losses.|$|E

50|$|A simple {{modification}} to the British Gas SNG {{technology will}} enable carbon negative SNG to be produces at 60 bar pressure, and high purity supercritical CO2 {{to be produced}} at 150 bar pressure, at near zero net loss of energy efficiency, or additional cost. Carbon negative SNG {{can be used to}} generate carbon negative electricity at lower cost than incumbent fossil gas or electricity. Given that electricity and gas can both be decarbonised with equal facility, and at nearly equal low costs, {{there is no need to}} introduce an onerous EPS with a view to largely 'squeezing' gas fired electricity generation off the grid by 2030. Instead it is proposed that technology neutral equal renewables and decarbonisation targets are introduced for both low carbon gas and electricity, with <b>Contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>Differences</b> for both low carbon gas and low carbon electricity, the relative 'strike prices' to be set by reference to the historic gas to electricity price ratio. This will spread cost-effective decarbonisation equally over both the gas and electricity grids, and their associated infrastructure.|$|E

40|$|High {{levels of}} {{inflexible}} bilateral trade in southern Africa have limited the {{participation in the}} competitive short-term markets, leading to inefficient use of energy infrastructure and blocking the South African Power Pool's long-term goal of transitioning from a cooperative to competitive market. Under the current supply and investment climate, governments and market participants are unlikely to forego their preference for long-term contracts owing to concerns about security of supply and risk mitigation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the current method for integrating bilateral and market trading introduces inefficiencies {{in the use of}} generation and transmission infrastructure, reduces total trade, and increases system costs. We propose and test an alternative method based on <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>differences</b> and implicit auctions to ensure the same level of security of supply for contract holders while minimising market distortions...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that financial transmission rights allow their owners to capture {{at least a}} portion, and sometimes all, of the congestion rents. This extends {{work in this area}} by Shmuel Oren which was limited to the case in which generators could not purchase financial transmission rights. One form of financial rights, Transmission Congestion Contracts (TCCs), is shown to be so effective in reducing market power that as few as two generators facing a demand curve with zero elasticity may be forced to sell at marginal cost. The extent to which market power is limited depends {{on the extent to which}} total generation capacity exceeds export capacity and on the size of individual generators. A relationship is derived that determines when TCCs will eliminate market power. In the case of a three line network, it is shown that the reduction in market power that can be accomplished with "active transmission rights" can also be accomplished with simple <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>differences...</b>|$|E
40|$|William Hogan {{introduced}} financial {{transmission rights}} {{as a tool to}} hedge the locational risk inherent in locational marginal prices. FTRs are claimed to serve four main purposes: (1) provide a hedge for nodal price differences, (2) provide revenue sufficiency for <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>differences,</b> (3) distribute the merchandizing surplus an RTO accrues in market operations, and (4) provide a price signal for transmission and generation developers. This paper examines the hedging and redistributional properties of FTRs. It argues that FTR allocation has important distributional impacts and related implications for retail rates. This observation adds an additional explanation for rate increases in light of decreased production costs due to restructuring. This paper also shows that RTO practices have important implications for the hedging characteristics of FTRs. It further shows, via counterexample, that, even in theory, FTRs may not serve as a perfect hedge against congestion charges. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations for FTR allocation and the functions that FTRs should serve. Financial transmission rights Retail rates Hedging...|$|E
40|$|How do {{changes in}} the market {{architecture}} affect the dynamics of deregulated electricity prices? We investigate this issue {{in the context of}} the Italian Power Exchange (IPEX), using data on the daily average day-ahead price (PUN) between April 2004 and December 2008. Estimates of baseline time series models (ARMAX and ARMAX-EGARCH) and their forecasting performances suggest that the trend in natural gas prices, deterministic weekly patterns, the impact of perceived temperatures, persistence in conditional volatility and the inverse leverage effect are essential features of the PUN dynamics. We then augment the best-performing models with dummies that account for {{changes in the}} market architecture, such as the introduction of <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>differences</b> (CfDs) to support renewables, trading of white certificates for energy efficiency, and the demandside liberalization. The findings show that changes in the market architecture have only affected the PUN volatility. Specifically, CfDs have mitigated volatility, while white certificates and demand liberalization have increased it. Moreover, after controlling for reforms the inverse leverage effect vanishes, and the persistence in volatility is lower than in the baseline estimates. electricity prices, Italian power exchange, market architecture, ARMA, EGARCH...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-level oligopoly power producer’s capacity investment game model, whose first level considers optimal regulation policy, and second-level models producer’s capacity investment strategy {{based on the}} analysis of power producer’s equilibrium biding strategy with capacity and price cap constraints at third level.

For the proportion of power in CFDs being very big and power supply being relatively nervous in Chinese power market, we discuss the effect of power capacity investment subsidies and CFDs power price on power supply and demand, whose results indicate that reducing the proportion of CFDs’ power in the power producer’s access grid power is an effective way to alleviate the tension in power supply and demand, and the current renewable energy policy can neither necessarily ease the tension condition of power supply nor can it necessarily promote the construction of renewable power generation units...|$|E
