5|$|The first {{remarkable}} historiographical {{school of}} {{interpretation of the}} history of Argentina was founded by members of the 1837 generation, including Bartolomé Mitre. Mitre regarded the May Revolution as an iconic expression of political egalitarianism: a conflict between modern freedoms and oppression represented by the Spanish monarchy, and an attempt to establish a national organization on constitutional principles as opposed to the <b>charismatic</b> <b>authority</b> of the caudillos. These authors' views were treated as canonical {{until the end of the}} 19thcentury, when the proximity of the centennial encouraged authors to seek new perspectives. The newer authors would differ about the relative weight of the causes of the May Revolution and about whose intervention in the events was more decisive, but the main views expressed by Mitre were kept, such as to consider the revolution to be the birth of modern Argentina and an unavoidable event. These authors introduced the idea of popular intervention as another key element. By the time of the World Wars, liberal authors attempted to impose an ultimate and unquestionable historical perspective; Ricardo Levene and the Academia Nacional de la Historia were exponents of this tendency, which still kept most perspectives of Mitre. Left-wing authors took a revisionist view based on nationalism and anti-imperialism; they minimized the dispute between criollos and peninsulars and portrayed events as a dispute between enlightenment and absolutism. However, most of their work was focused on other historical periods.|$|E

50|$|History has {{witnessed}} several social movements or revolutions, against {{a system of}} traditional or legal-rational authority, which are usually started by <b>Charismatic</b> <b>authorities.</b> Weber states that what distinguishes authority from coercion, force and power on the one hand, and leadership, persuasion and influence on the other hand, is legitimacy.

Social scientists agree that authority is but one of several resources available to incumbents in formal positions. For example, a Head of State is dependent upon a similar nesting of authority. His legitimacy must be acknowledged, not just by citizens, but by those who control other valued resources: his immediate staff, his cabinet, military leaders and in the long run, the administration and political apparatus of the entire society.|$|R

40|$|HIV-AIDS is both {{an agency}} for change and an unfortunate side effect of the revolutionising forces of {{globalisation}} and modernisation. The epidemic should not be viewed simply as a biomedical concern. HIV-AIDS brings into question all that motivates and preoccupies a society. By looking into the phenomenon of such a meaning-laden illness we can learn much about a nation {{and the way that}} nation wishes to be portrayed. In recent times, HIV-AIDS has been perceived theoretically as a gendered epidemic. The inference is that the virus is longer perceived to affect homosexuals or marginalised communities only: it has also taken on a female face. In developing nations the epidemic is conceptualised as an illness of deviants and a metaphor for socio-sexual liberation and transgression. This understanding has encouraged policy makers and <b>charismatic</b> <b>authorities</b> to vigorously promote strictly conservative cultural values in order {{to address the issue of}} HIV-AIDS. Javanese culture has very clear understandings of masculinity and femininity, articulated in a gender ideology which was strengthened and systematically imposed during the period of the conservative Suharto regime. Women who stepped outside the models prescribed by this ideology were and continue to be condemned and silenced. A conservative gender and sexuality ideology shapes the manner in which men and women interact. Nevertheless, throughout history there have existed alternative models. In the contemporary period these models in many ways align with influences from other worlds. Young women living in urban contexts in Java are exploring alternative ways of self-expression, beginning to question traditional ideals and demonstrating diversifying and modernised socio-sexual behaviours. This dissertation seeks to explore emerging female socio-sexual identities in Y ogyakarta, Indonesia, within the framework of the impact of HIV-AIDS and young women's perceptions of the epidemic. Observations of the lifestyles of young women are brought together with an exploration of their attitudes and experiences related to sexuality and HIVAIDS. It is argued that HIV-AIDS can be used as conceptual tool for investigating change. The manner in which the epidemic has been apprehended by the authorities and how it is understood and experienced within society can be seen to reflect both the formal agendas of the nation and how nation and society are transforming...|$|R

The most splendid {{of all of}} the sociological classics, Weber's Economy and Society, contributed a great deal to the understanding of political behavior. Yet it is not a political work in the same sense as Aristotle's Politics or Hobbes's Leviathan. Economy and Society sometimes hints at but never enumerates the "best practical" regime. Aristotle and Hobbes had no doubt that such a regime existed, even if they disagreed about what it was.

25|$|The Sanbō Kyōdan {{was also}} {{influential}} in introducing <b>charismatic</b> <b>authority</b> in Western Zen, by its dependency on {{the authority of}} Yasutani, while simultaneously standing outside the mainstream of Japanese Zen. It was transplanted into a culture that is unaware of the specific characteristics of Japanese culture regarding authority. The stress on kenshō as means of authority, coupled to the primacy of maintaining the correct dharma transmission, led to institutional problems when Yasutani's heir Yamada Koun died, {{in the view of}} some disaffected former members. Shortly before his death in 1989 Yamada Koun passed on the leadership of the Sanbo Kyodan directly to Kubota Jiun Roshi, who was its abbot until 2004, whereupon the abbacy passed to Yamada Ryoun Roshi. While a handful of Western teachers authorized by Sanbo-Zen left the organization, some 40 or so remain within it, and the institution itself has evolved and shows signs of growing strength and resilience. The direct lineage of the “Three Clouds” (Harada, Yasutani and Yamada) maintains a strong core and trunk in today's Sanbo-Zen. Seeing one's nature gives an autonomous confirmation of Zen's ultimate truth, which may conflict with the need to maintain institutions and traditions. On the other hand, it may foster a renewal and revitalization of the core of Zen teaching, and allow for styles of Zen practice to emerge that are more relevant to non-Japanese contexts.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the course}} of the 20 th century {{genocide}} has been responsible for the murder of more than 170 million people; it is has proven to be four times deadlier than war (Voth, 2007). Although it often appears spontaneous, Genocide is instead a result of certain preconditions. Studies into the causes of genocide ought to aid in the formation of methods intended to keep violence from occurring. Unfortunately, seemingly different factors such as economic crisis, resource scarcity, institutional weakness, and ethnic resentment prove difficult to classify as the ultimate cause. Instead these conditions work collectively to create an atmosphere that is conducive to the emergence of genocidal behaviors. These preconditions can be specific to the cultures in which they arise; however there exists a continuity with which genocide may be characterized. All these conditions may be exacerbated by the common existence of a norm entrepreneur. For the purpose of this paper, a norm entrepreneur is an individual that holds some appearance of power which he/she uses to create or recreate social/societal norms through which polarizing attitudes are formed. In the case of genocide, these individuals may use a variety of methods intended to foster an atmosphere of hate. I argue that norm entrepreneurs are a catalyst to the emergence and growth of specific norms; {{and in the case of}} genocide, they are a necessary precursor to group polarization and ethnic violence. While the presence of a norm entrepreneur is merely one of many factors that contribute to the proliferation of polarizing attitudes and behaviors, he/she is the trigger to the emergence of genocidal violence. To begin I define the role of the norm entrepreneur while also describing how he/she may alter individual and group behavior. Following are a series of studies that demonstrate how a norm entrepreneur may influence an individual or group to commit acts of genocide. For example, the results of Philip Zimbardo’s study Diary of an Abandoned Automobile speak to the context of anonymity and the role it plays in the appearance of evil behaviors (Zimbardo, 2007). Also, Zimbardo’s Stanford Prison Experiment illustrates that an individual may single-­‐handedly create an environment in which evil behaviors may arise while simultaneously displays how the arbitrary creation of groups can lead to in-­‐group/out-­‐group polarization and dehumanization (Zimbardo, 2007). Moreover, the results of Stanley Milgram’s experiment on obedience indicate that individuals are more likely to participate in evil actions when under the command of an authority figure (Milgram, 1974). This is pertinent in that my hypothesis assumes that norm entrepreneurs must possess some semblance of power in order for their norms to experience the cascading effect necessary for them to become a part of the social fabric (Finnemore, 1998). Although it is difficult to prove the efficacy of a norm entrepreneur to alter group behavior, I discuss these studies in an attempt to further link the possibility of an individual to intensify polarized attitudes to such a point that genocide may occur. Next I discuss the Rwandan genocide prior to which, the existence of norm entrepreneurs appears to have been a necessary precursor. In Rwanda a series of endorsements made by President Habyarimana clearly condoned the use of violence against the Tutsi population. His lack of concern over the distribution of thousands of machetes indicated that violence was not only the answer, it was appropriate. In fact, many political figures sanctioned the use of violence against the Tutsi population; this allowed for a diffusion of responsibility among the Hutu participants. Much scholarship exists as to the causes of the Rwandan genocide; however, I argue that the presence of norm entrepreneurs is what exacerbated pre-­‐existing tension caused by ethnic disparity and food scarcity to a point where genocide became inevitable. Accordingly, in his book The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil, Dr. Philip Zimbardo commented, “Human beings are capable of totally abandoning their humanity for a mindless ideology, to follow and then exceed the orders of <b>charismatic</b> <b>authorities</b> to destroy everyone they label as “The Enemy” (Zimbardo, 2007) ...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the study}} of chiefs, elders and local leaders in {{southern}} Ethiopia, this paper analyses the idea of authority, legitimacy and governance among three small-scale societies, the Meén, the Dizi and the Suri. It shows that in southern Ethiopia efforts were made to replace <b>charismatic</b> and traditional <b>authority</b> by a bureaucratic structure of rulers and legal procedures instigated by the expanding national State, but that this process was neither complete nor successful, because the sources of legitimacy of leadership and authority remained firmly within the local societies and were ill understood by outsiders, including State authorities. The central imperial State (upto 1974) did not use the pre-existing forms of local chiefs and other authorities and simply bypassed them either by appointing its own administrators as an extra layer of power or by relying upon provincial lords or kings in the core regions of the empire. The appointees had little connection with the local population. If they became too popular they were removed. Their loyalty only had to be upward, towards the emperor and his political circle. In the Derg era (1974 - 1991), this authoritarian pattern was reinforced, and wherever traditional chiefs existed, they were violently removed and suppressed. To date these three forms of authority co-exist and interact and define much of the local political dynamics, including violent conflict. Bibliogr., notes. [ASC Leiden abstract...|$|R

40|$|Harnack Is {{best known}} as a church {{historian}} of the first rank, but a case can also be made for his significance as a constructive theologian. This thesis sets out to examine his theology using an interpretive framework not employed before, namely, the theme of power which runs throughout his work. Use is made of the sociological typology of power developed by Dennis Wrong on the basis of Weber, of Michael Mann's work on the origins of social power, and of Peter Berger's classification of various theological approaches to secularisation and religious pluralism. The investigation broadens the base of Harnack research by making fuller use than has generally the case of publications other than Das Wesen and Dogmengeschichte. and pays attention to Harnack's devotional as well as his scholarly writing. The theory of power which emerges is strongly dualistic, distinguishing interior, ideological power from external, social power. Divine power empowers individuals from within, via their acceptance of the <b>charismatic</b> and competent <b>authority</b> of Jesus as legitimate authority, and the concomitant attribution of benign, nutrient power to the character of God. This acceptance produces markedly beneficial effects upon the individual’s emotional and moral state, which gives rise to constructive activity in the external world. Inherent in this theory is a high estimate of the empowering possibilities of ideas and personalities. Harnack argues that the early church underwent a regrettable process Ctranspotentiation'), involving the growth of external, coercive authority and a diminution in the availability of interior, divine/spiritual power. Harnack's work contains serious tensions related to its untenable dualism and its ambivalence about the possibility of legitimate external authority in the church. But his explanation of divine/spiritual empowering provided a plausible, attractive theodicy and apologetic in its time. With modifications it could do so again, and is of especial value in developing an existential theology of the inner life...|$|R
