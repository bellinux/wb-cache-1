25|$|The {{synthesis}} of oxazoline rings {{is well established}} and in general proceeded via the <b>cyclisation</b> of a 2‑amino alcohol with any {{of a number of}} suitable functional groups. In the case of bis(oxazoline)s, synthesis is most conveniently achieved by using bi-functional starting materials; as this allows both rings to be produced at once. Of the materials suitable, dicarboxylic or dinitrile compounds are the most commonly available and hence the majority bis(oxazoline) ligands are produced from these materials.|$|E
