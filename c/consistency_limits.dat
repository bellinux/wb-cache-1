In this work changes of <b>consistency</b> <b>limits</b> of a loessy soil from the borrow pit Horky nad Jizerou with amount of added {{quicklime}} (CaO) and curing time were observed. From the development of <b>consistency</b> <b>limits</b> the lowest amount of quicklime needed {{for the establishment of}} long - term (pozzolanic) reactions in the soil was determined. <b>Consistency</b> <b>limits</b> were determined following standardized procedures in an accredited laboratory. Determination of the liquid limit was conducted using the 80 g/ 30 ř fall cone. Firstly sample heating caused by the exothermic nature of the slaking reaction CaO + H 2 O → Ca(OH) 2 + heat and rapid soil flocculation after the lime addition were observed. Furthermore increase of the plastic limit, unpredictable behavior of the liquid limit and therefore influenced behavior of the plasticity index in agreement with findings stated in the research part were observed.

The chemical and engineering behaviors of Cochin and Mangalore marine clays are also {{compared with those of}} the smectite-rich Ariake Bay marine clay from Japan. Although Cochin, Mangalore, and Ariake clays contain comparable amounts of smectite (32 - 45 %), Ariake clay exhibits lower <b>consistency</b> <b>limits</b> and much higher ranges of liquidity indices than the Indian marine clays. The lower <b>consistency</b> <b>limits</b> of the Ariake clay are attributed to the absence of well-developed, long-range, interparticle forces associated with the clay. Also, Ariake clay exhibits a significantly large (48 - 714 times) decrease in undrained strength on remolding in comparison to Cochin and Mangalore clays (sensitivity ranges between 1 and 4). A preponderance of long-range, interparticle forces reflected in the high <b>consistency</b> <b>limits</b> of Cochin and Mangalore clays (wL range from 75 to 180 %) combined with low natural water contents yield low liquidity indices (typically < 1) and high, remolded, undrained strengths and are considered to be responsible for the low sensitivity of the Indian marine clays...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} of <b>consistency</b> <b>limits</b> according to Atterberg is of key importance in soil mechanics because it determines, {{in a simple}} way, results of interactions between solid and liquid phases in soils, and thus provides possibility to classify them in groups withsimilar mechanic properties.

In this paper an attempt has been made to devise a test procedure, known as the absorption test, which simulates the mechanisms controlling the water holding-capacity of soils.

Network latency and jitter are concerns in this context, although the impact is reduced by the use of predictive techniques such as dead reckoning.

However, Atterberg’s <b>consistency</b> <b>limit</b> tests indicate that the samples are moderate to high plastic soils with moderate swelling potential. Hence, their use as base and sub-base construction materials for heavy traffic roads require pre-treatment with non-plastic soils, bitumen, cement and/or lime.
