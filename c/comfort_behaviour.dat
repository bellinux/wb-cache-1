5000|$|<b>Comfort</b> <b>behaviours</b> are {{performed}} {{from an early}} age and change little during development. Several <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviours</b> are associated with the beginning of a rest period (e.g. grooming), whereas others are associated with the end of a rest period (e.g. stretching), possibly to prepare the body for escape or hunting. Others, (e.g. dust bathing) will be performed only when the appropriate internal and external stimuli are present (see also sham dustbathing). Animals generally perform <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviours</b> only when they are not engaged in essential activities (e.g. feeding, drinking, hunting, escape); these behaviours are therefore sometimes categorised as luxury activities. However, animals can be highly motivated to perform some <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviours</b> (e.g. dust bathing in hens), and conditions that thwart these behaviours (e.g. battery cages) are considered to have a negative influence on animal welfare.

Twelve focal animals in each of four groups (two groups per genotype) were observed regarding their grazing, social and <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviour</b> on pasture. No significant differences in grazing behaviour patterns (eating, walking, standing) were found between the genotypes. Resting occurred only very rarely in both genotypes. Walking distances of Ankole and Ankole × Holstein crosses were also similar. There was no difference in the occurrence of agonistic interactions between the two genotypes. However, Ankole cattle engaged in more non-agonistic social interactions than their crossbred counterparts. Individual distances were lower in Ankole heifers and more herd mates were found within a radius of 5 m around the Ankole animals. The most important <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviour</b> pattern in both genotypes was self-licking, which occurred to similar frequency in Ankole and crossbred heifer groups. Crossbred animals scratched themselves and rubbed on objects more often than Ankole heifers. Although Ankole cattle and their Holstein crosses did not differ in grazing, distances walked and agonistic behaviours, the significant differences between the two genotypes in herd cohesion and <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviour</b> may pose challenges on the management of crossbred animals under extensive open grazing conditions as present in south western Uganda.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{drive power}} in motor vehicles requires an improved performance of friction linings and counterpart material in clutches. The most important criteria are {{the coefficient of}} friction, the wear rate, the specific weight, the judder and noise inclination. The frictional heat developing during the engagement process leads to a high temperature load of the lining surface. So far organic friction linings are used preferentially because of their good <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviour</b> and low price. Their properties were improved continually over the last years. However their performance is limited especially by the transferable specific friction energy. Thus the evaluation of alternative friction materials is an important goal of the clutch manufacturers. For the investigations pin-on-disc tests with inertia simulation on different material couples were accomplished. The adjustable mass inertia of the system ensures a defined friction energy per clutch procedure. This permits {{the evaluation of the}} friction value as a function of running speed and cycle number as well as the determination of the wear rate related to the performed friction energy. Additionally the noise emission was measured for the evaluation of the <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The results of the pin-on-disc tests showed a good correlation to the accomplished component tests...|$|E

40|$|Underlying {{the study}} of animal welfare is the {{assumption}} that animals experience emotional states. Although there has been a bias towards studying negative emotions, research into positive emotions is necessary for an overall welfare assessment. The aim of the current study was to find behavioural expressions specific for anticipation of different events in domestic fowl, Gallus gallus omesticus. To this aim, we used a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm by which we induced anticipation of a positive, neutral and negative event. We investigated whether birds were able to discriminate between sound cues signalling these events with different valences and, if so, whether anticipation of different events is reflected in different behavioural responses. The birds showed a response of increased attention to all sound cues. In anticipation of the negative event, the birds showed more head movements and locomotion than in anticipation of both the neutral and positive event, possibly reflecting the aversive nature of the negative event. In anticipation of the positive event, the birds showed more <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviours,</b> such as preening and wing flapping, which have been associated with a state of relaxation. Our study shows that laying hens are able to anticipate differentially a positive, neutral and negative event announced by different sound cues. It is also the first study to identify <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviours</b> as specifically associated with anticipation of a positive event in domestic fowl. <b>Comfort</b> <b>behaviours</b> may therefore be associated with a positive emotional state in domestic fowl...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was first, to assess the effects of EE in battery cages on the behaviour of young Japanese quail and second, to evaluate the impact of EE on quail exposed to chronic stress. The experiment involved quail housed in EE cages and submitted or not to a chronic stress procedure (CSP) (EE cages, control quail: n= 16, CSP quail: n= 14) and quail housed in standard cages and exposed or not to the CSP (standard non-EE cages, control quail: n= 12, CSP quail: n= 16). Our procedure consisted of repeated aversive events (e. g. ventilators, delaying access to food, physical restraint, noise) presented two to five times per 24 h, randomly, for 15 days. During CSP, EE improved quail's welfare as their stereotypic pacing decreased and they rested more. CSP decreased exploration in all quail. After the end of CSP, quail presented increased emotional reactivity in emergence test. However, the effect of EE varied with test. Finally, chronic stress effects on <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviours</b> in the emergence test were alleviated by EE.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{behavioural}} requirements of laying hens. It primarily concentrates on evidence from consumer demand studies and relates {{this to the}} behavioural and physical consequences of denying hens opportunities to express certain activities. Hens clearly place {{a high value on}} food and this provides a useful yardstick for assessing the value of other resources. Hens have been found to work for access to a range of additional resources including pecking, scratching and dust bathing substrates, perches (particularly prior to nightfall), additional space and nestboxes. So far, only nestboxes (prior to oviposition) have been found to have a value comparable to food (in food-deprived hens). To date, however, no study has systematically compared the value of a range of resources. Furthermore, {{only a limited number of}} studies have related deprivation of specific resources to behavioural or physiological measures of distress. Egg production is clearly very efficient economically when hens are housed in conventional wire cages and provided with adequate food and water, but the hens show signs of frustrated nesting and pecking/scratching behaviour in these conditions. Modified or enriched cages allow for these activities, as well as perching, and, potentially dust bathing, but do not allow full expression of exploratory or <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviours,</b> Free-range systems, percheries and other types of colony housing provide opportunities for all of the above, although at high stocking densities social competition and limited space may restrict performance of these behaviours for certain birds...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine how food {{deprivation}} effects food-related and other behavioural systems of red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and the domesticated White Leghorn layers. If an animal is denied to perform their natural behaviours, like eating, sleeping or preening, the motivation for the behaviour can increase. Behavioural systems may interact and motivation to perform behaviours may be influenced. After being deprived of a certain need the reaction can become exaggerated or abnormal. Food deprivation is often used in ethology research to motivate animals. The hypothesis in this study was that the chickens would become affected by the food deprivation and reallocate their behaviours. They would get more stressed and frustrated. Domestication effects and sex differences were explored. The birds were tested in four standardized behavioural tests; food consumption test, general behavioural test, open field test and novel object test. The results showed that they foraged and explored more, had less <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and less perching the longer they had been without food. They did not show a higher degree of frustration, stress or aggressive behaviours. There were domestication effects, where the Leghorns seem to have lost some of their ability to respond adaptively to food shortage.

The goal of this experiment {{was to determine if}} individuals with ASD exhibit end-state <b>comfort</b> <b>behaviours</b> similar to their typically developing peers in joint-action situations. Participants were asked to either pass, place, or use three common tools: a wooden toy hammer, a stick, or a calculator. These tools were selected because the degree of affordance they offer (i. e., the physical characteristics they posses to prompt proper use) ranges from direct (hammer) to indirect (calculator). Participants were asked to pass the tool to a confederate who intended to place the tool down, or use the tool. Variables of interest included beginning and end-state grip orientations of the participant and confederate (comfortable or uncomfortable) as a function of task goal, and the side to which the tool was placed or passed. Similar to Gonzalez et al. 2011, some individuals with ASD maximized their partner’s beginning-state comfort by adopting personally uncomfortable postures. That said, their performance was more variable than their TD peers who consistently passed tools in a manner that facilitated comfortable use by the confederate. Therefore, the movement planning processes used to prepare to pass a tool are not stereotypical across all individuals with ASD.

40|$|Animal-borne logging or {{telemetry}} {{devices are}} widely used for measurements of physiological and movement data from free-living animals. For such measurements to be relevant, however, {{it is essential that}} the devices themselves do not affect the data of interest. A recent meta-analysis reported an overall negative effect of these devices on the birds that bear them, i. e. on nesting productivity, clutch size, nest initiation date, offspring quality, body condition, flying ability, foraging behaviours, energy expenditure and survival rate. Method of attachment (harness, collar, glue, anchor, implant, breast-mounted or tailmount) had no influence on the strength of these effects but anchored and implanted transmitters had the highest reported rates of device-induced mortality. Furthermore, external devices, but not internal devices, caused an increase in ‘device-induced behaviour’ (<b>comfort</b> <b>behaviours</b> such as preening, fluffing and stretching, and unrest activities including unquantifiable ‘active’ behaviours). These findings suggest that, with the exception of device-induced behaviour, external attachment is preferable to implantation. In the present study we undertake a meta-analysis of 183 estimates of device impact from 39 studies of 36 species of bird designed to explicitly compare the effects of externally attached and surgically implanted devices on a range of traits, including condition, energy expenditure and reproduction. In contrast to a previous study, we demonstrate that externally attached devices have a consistent detrimental effect (i. e. negative influences on body condition, reproduction, metabolism and survival), whereas implanted devices have no consistent effect. We also show that the magnitude of the negative effect of externally attached devices decreases with time. We therefore conclude that device implantation is preferable to external attachment, providing that the risk of mortality associated with the anaesthesia and surgery required for implantation can be mitigated. We recommend that studies employing external devices use devices that can be borne for long periods, and, wherever possible, deploy devices in advance of the time period of interest. Craig R.
