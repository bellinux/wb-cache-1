40|$|In nineties Serbia {{survived the}} {{disintegration}} of the former Yugoslavia, intense UN sanctions, and 1999 78 days of bombing by NATO. This has resulted in a drop in production and hyperinflation. The confidence in the national currency the dinar has been lost. In order to do business in Serbia returned to normal framework the Law on Foreign Exchange imposed the possibility of nomination the loans in foreign currencies. This prompted the business, but it meant a de facto legalization of dual currency system. The logical consequence was the high degree of dollarization. It is important to mention that the dual currency system limited the possibilities of monetary policy of the National Bank of Serbia. Dollarization after the first positive results showed their expected bad sides. Appreciation of the dinar was one of the consequences. The trade deficit and foreign debt grew. Due to the appreciation production rate remained at 40 % of its 1989 level, and unemployment has risen to 27 %. The benefit of the appreciation had only importers and foreign-owned banks. They take out the capital abroad. Therefore, it is necessary to make changes to the Foreign Exchange Law and abolish foreign <b>currency</b> <b>clause</b> at least for a new loans...|$|E
40|$|Timothy Canova, Banking and Financial Reform at the Crossroads of the Neoliberal Contagion, 14 American University International Law Review 1571 (1999). At {{the time}} of publication, this article {{provided}} the most in-depth critique of capital account liberalization in any U. S. law journal. The article stemmed from a paper presented by the author to the Seventh Annual Conference of the United States-Mexico Law Institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico on October 3, 1998, during the climax {{of one of the}} most volatile periods in the global financial markets. The Russian ruble was in free fall, and so was Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund that was threatening to bring down its own large creditors. The crisis was averted only by an emergency multi-billion dollar bailout brokered at the offices of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. This article situates that financial volatility within the context of the 19902 ̆ 7 s global currency contagion that had spread from Mexico and Latin America to East Asia. Canova identified a recurring pattern associated with the liberalization of portfolio capital. The initial dependence on short-term foreign investment requires a restrictive monetary policy and higher interest rates to maintain the inflow. The inflow, however, contributes to overvalued exchange rates that in turn contribute to unsustainable trade and current account deficits. What follows is an inevitable panic sell-off and flight to foreign-denominated assets. The sudden outflow of capital then leads to fiscal austerity and other disciplines imposed as conditions for International Monetary Fund (IMF) assistance. After describing the dynamics of contagion, Canova inventories the range of legal instruments and institutions prematurely pushing capital account liberalization on developing countries. From the IMF Articles of Agreement to IMF loan conditions, from Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) to provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Canova demonstrates that the program of capital account liberalization is part of a Wall Street agenda. The symbiotic relationship between regulators and private financial actors raises fundamental constitutional questions about accountability in a representative democracy. The article concludes by proposing several reforms of the international monetary system, including various restrictions on short-term capital flows, the recycling of surpluses through foreign aid flows, and the issuance of global currency in the form of Special Drawing Rights. The analysis synthesizes various methodological approaches, including comparative, historical and institutional approaches: prudential restrictions on portfolio inflows (such as the Chilean ¿encage¿); a global turnover tax on currency transactions (such as the Tobin Tax proposal, named after former Nobel economist, the late James Tobin); reform of the burdens of adjustment (modeled on the Marshall Plan); and use of the dormant Scarce <b>Currency</b> <b>clause</b> in the IMF Articles of Agreement. The article deals with obscure and often technical matters in an easy-to-read conversational style that is accessible to non-experts...|$|E

The paper {{deals with}} {{arguments}} which support {{the thesis of}} existing local currency overvaluation and suggests exchange rate arrangement {{in the form of}} asymmetric interventions of central bank, which would enable gradual real kuna appreciation. The arguments for kuna overvaluation are based on the analysis of price and rate movement in relatively short period after procclamation of the Stabilization program in October 1993 and on development of costs in the years which followed. Devaluation of about 20 percent made in the moment of proclammation of program initiated adjustment and high price increase: producers prices increased for 23 percent and retail prices for 38 percent, and they kept on that level. However, the rate returned to the pre-program level already after amonth and a half. In this short episode undoubtedly happened considerable local currency overvaluation. The rate mainly remained stable after that, but labour costs, i. e. in processing industry which generates almost the whole exports of goods, were increasing almost as productivity growth did, and it also continued the tax pressure increase. Overvaluation grew by this, and competitiveness of domestic producers was decreasing not only at foreign but at domestic market as well. Increasing <b>currency</b> substitution (<b>currency</b> <b>clauses)</b> makes at this moment devaluation too expensive and risky move of economic policy. Therefore possible solution should be found in gradual, targeted and corrected rate by unsymmetric interventions of central bank with corresponding support of fiscal policy...|$|R
40|$|A {{dumping margin}} {{calculation}} involves currency conversion {{of either the}} export price of the normal value. Although the Anti-dumping Agreement permits the conversion of currency when {{it is necessary for}} the price comparison, it does not provide a sufficient guideline to guard against potential distortion in the dumping margin calculation resulting from conversion. Unless the conversion is done with an appropriate exchange rate, an investigating authority's price comparison potentially results in a spurious estimate of dumping margin, in violation of the fair comparison requirement of Article 2. 4 of the Anti-dumping Agreement. In particular, the distortion in the dumping margin calculation is magnified when the exchange rate moves significantly. This paper reviews the <b>currency</b> conversion <b>clause</b> of the Anti-dumping Agreement and suggests modifications in order to address the shortcomings. currency conversion, anti-dumping agreement...|$|R
40|$|What is {{the role}} of foreign {{currency}} debt in precipitating financial crises? In this paper we assemble data for nearly 30 countries between 1880 and 1913 and examine debt crises, currency crises, banking crises and twin crises. We pay special attention to the role of foreign <b>currency</b> and gold <b>clause</b> debt, <b>currency</b> mismatches and debt intolerance. We find fairly robust evidence that more foreign currency debt leads to a higher chance of having a debt crisis or a banking crisis. However, a key finding is that countries with noticeably different backgrounds, and strong institutions such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, and the US deftly managed their exposure to hard currency debt, generally avoided having too many crises and never had severe financial meltdowns. Moreover, a strong reserve position matched up to hard currency liabilities seems to be correlated with a lower likelihood of a debt crisis, currency crisis or a banking crisis. This strengthens the evidence for the hypothesis that foreign currency debt is dangerous when mis-managed. We also see that countries with previous default histories seem prone to debt crises even at seemingly low debt to revenue ratios. Finally we discuss the robustness of these results to local idiosyncrasies and the implications from this representative historical sample. ...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, {{we first}} generalize Leland (1994 b) ’s {{structural}} model from constant volatility to the state-dependent volatility with constant elasticity (CEV) and obtain the analytical solution for most variables of interest, including first-passage default probability, corporate debt and equity value. After incorporating jumps into asset dynamics, we develop an efficient algorithm {{to calculate the}} first passage default probability by adopting a restricted structure of default times and derive numerical solutions for the variables of interest. We find that the extra parameter in the CEV structural model has {{a significant impact on}} the optimal capital structure, the debt capacity, the term structure of credit spreads, the duration and convexity of risky debt, the equity volatility, the asset substitution impacts and the cumulative default probabilities. Further, we incorporate the liquidity risk of the secondary bond market into the structural model with a constant elasticity of variance through the rollover channel and derive the analytical expressions for the variables of interest with an innovative method in Chapter 2. We find that state dependent volatility has noticeable impacts for all the interesting results, including the endogenous default boundary, the optimal leverage and the credit spreads, which depend on the value of the state dependence parameter. In Chapter III, we compare the empirical performance of the two alternative volatility assumptions that we used in our study within the context of the Leland (1994 b) model. Using time series data from both firm and risk level, We document that CEV structural model with the elasticity parameter around - 0. 67 on average exhibits a superior fitting in the CDS spreads across all the maturities. The relationship between the sign and value of and the firm specific measures of default risk, such as leverage ratios, CDS spreads and current ratios indicates that there is a tendency for to increase as the risk of the firm decreases, but that the tendency is weak and fluctuates. We also note that the CDPs generated by the CEV structural model can fit the Moody’s observed data much better compared to these with constant asset volatility. In the last Chapter, we study the market efficiency between the CDS and Loan CDS (LCDS) markets by constructing a CDS and LCDS parity relation under the no arbitrage assumption. We document persistent and significant violations of this relation with the cross sectional data from both markets. We identify time-varying and significant positive arbitrage profits from an artificial default risk-free portfolio that trades in both markets and simultaneously longs an undervalued contract and shorts the corresponding overvalued contract for exactly the same underlying firm, maturity, <b>currency</b> and restructure <b>clauses.</b> We show that the profits cannot be accounted for by trading costs or imperfect data about loan recovery rates in the event of default. Using panel regressions with macroeconomic and firm-level variables, we find that firm-level informational asymmetry and difficulty of loan recovery in case of default are much more important than macroeconomic factors in accounting for the arbitrage profits. ...|$|R
