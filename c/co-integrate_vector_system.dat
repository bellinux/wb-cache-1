There have been mixed results regarding the validity of the PPP relationship. Moreover, the causality issue between exchange rate and relative prices has not been investigated in previous studies in the context of Australia. Using quarterly data from 1984 :Q 1 to 012 :Q 4, this paper examines three issues: (i) the co-integration between the exchange rate and elative prices, (ii) causality between the exchange rate and relative prices, and (iii) the time-varying property of the <b>co-integrating</b> <b>vector.</b> A log of the nominal exchange rate between Australia and the United States (AUD/USD) and a log of the ratio of the consumer price indices (CPIs) of the two countries were found to be co-integrated in the long run, which supports long-run PPP. Causality tests indicate that there is a causal effect of relative prices on the exchange rate in the long run. A time-varying co-integration analysis indicates that the <b>co-integrating</b> <b>vector</b> is not time-invariant and that the source of this invariant nature of the <b>co-integrating</b> <b>vector</b> seems to come from the coefficients of relative prices. The policy implication of these findings is that no policy intervention is needed to maintain the sustainability of external balance...|$|R

Two <b>co-integrating</b> <b>vectors</b> involving cocoa and coffee exports as endogenous variables are identified in the system while tests for exogeneity of cotton exports are consistent with the independence of cotton from the other two commodities. These findings are corroborated by estimates of a restricted error-correction model which lead to acceptance of the hypothesis that cocoa and coffee exports are indeed determined endogenously to the system and not linked to cotton exports. Statistical significance of the error-correction terms for cocoa and coffee validates the existence of an equilibrium relationship among the variables in each of these <b>co-integrating</b> <b>vectors.</b> The combined short-run dynamic effect of lagged quantities of cocoa and coffee, export/domestic price ratio and GDP jointly explain changes in exports of cocoa whereas lagged quantities exported do not seem to have a significant short-run dynamic effect on changes in coffee exports...|$|R

A law of one <b>co-integrating</b> <b>vector</b> of prices is proposed for the exchange rate and domestic and overseas stock prices.

Under the identification restriction that taste shocks are stationary, {{the model is}} shown to imply that log imports, log domestic goods, and the log relative price of imports are co-integrated. The data decisively reject the null hypothesis that imports, the relative price of imports, and the consumption of home goods are not co-integrated. We employ the non-linear least squares technique recently proposed by Phillips and Loretan (1990 > to estimate {{the parameters of the}} import demand equation. The long-run price elasticity of import demand is estimated to be - 0. 95. The elasticity of import demand with respect to a permanent increase in real spending is estimated to be 2. 20. These estimates fall within the range reported in studies by Helkie and Hooper (1986), Cline (1989), and the many studies surveyed by Goldstein and Kahn (1985) The message of this paper is that, at least for non-durable consumer goods, it is possible to interpret the traditional import demand equation as a co-integrating regression, and to interpret the price and expenditure elasticities estimated from such a trade equation as a <b>co-integrating</b> <b>vector.</b> Estimates of the <b>co-integrating</b> <b>vector</b> can be used to recover estimates of the utility parameters of the representative household.

In the second stage, a model of inflation is estimated with first differences of the non-stationary variables, a level variable and the <b>co-integrating</b> <b>vector.</b> Results indicate that inflation in Malawi is a result of both real and monetary shocks to the economy. It is further observed that current slumps in production generate inflationary pressures. This is due to the fact that food, a perishable product, exerts an immediate impact on inflation. Measures to control inflation must therefore emphasize enhancing production and supply, especially food. It is also imperative that efforts be made to improve distribution and road networks to reduce costs. It is worthy to note that although a lot of efforts have been made to curb domestic credit expansion, capital inflows are not usually taken into account and yet they constitute a major source of liquidity injection. Without proper measures including sterilization, the problem will continue to plague the nation. Monetary expansion will need to be controlled through more disciplined financial management to counteract these externally generated liquidity injections.

40|$|This {{paper is}} set to {{investigate}} {{the existence of a}} significant long-run relationship between nominal interest rates and price levels and examine the possible causal link between the variables of interest using quarterly data on Nigeria for the periods of 1970 – 2012. Maximum likelihood method of co-integration, suggested by Johansen (1988, 1991) and Granger causality in an ADL model with p and q lags suggested by Koop (2005) are implemented to determine the number of <b>co-integrating</b> <b>vectors</b> and verify the nature and direction of causality between nominal interest rates and the price levels in Nigeria respectively. The co-integration results show that the null hypothesis of no significant long-run stable relationship between nominal interest rates and the price levels is rejected for Nigeria with the identification of one <b>co-integrating</b> <b>vector.</b> This result fines support for Gibson Paradox in Nigeria which supports the view that nominal interest rates and the price levels trend together {{over a long period of}} time and on the positive note too. When the ADL models were estimated to gauge the extent of both long and short run causality between the variables of interest, the results suggest the existence of a very strong causal link from nominal interest rates to price levels, in the long run while no causality was identified in the short run. This portrays nominal interest rate as a veritable tool for the moderation of general price level in Nigeria. This by implication puts forward the fact that supply rather than demand side dominates in determining the level of consumer price index in Nigeria. Therefore policy efforts to drop inflation while keeping the nominal interest rate high may prove ineffective in Nigeria as the two share strong positive correlation...|$|R

It employs a <b>co-integrated</b> <b>vector</b> autoregressive model to account for potential endogeneity and nonstationarity problems. Results suggest that both private and public capital spending have stimulated economic growth in Sudan over the period 1970 - 1998. The impact of private investment on real growth has been more pronounced than that of public sector investment. Public sector investment appears to have deleteriously impacted private sector physical capital expansion, implying that the impact of crowding-out categories of public sector investment has been large enough to offset any crowding-in effects. Such crowding out effect has weakened favourable positive effect that public sector's investment has exerted on growth by jeopardising private sector capital undertakings.
