40|$|Creep {{failure of}} the weld {{structure}} in P 91 steel components in high temperature power plant applications is often a key factor limiting the lifetime of the components. Whilst creep failure in weld heat-affected zone (HAZ) regions has been studied widely, the creep properties of the weld metal itself have been less well documented. In this work, the creep response of P 91 weld metal in isolation was investigated in terms of microstructural evolution and mechanical properties. The microstructural examination of P 91 multi-pass weld metal revealed a typical weld metal structure including columnar regions and refined regions. The columnar region exhibited high hardness whilst the refined region exhibited lower hardness. The anisotropic creep behaviour of P 91 weld metal was observed in creep tests of both longitudinal and transverse specimens at 650 ºC and various stress levels. This behaviour can be correlated with the microstructural anisotropy observed, where longitudinal specimens with banded columnar regions and refined regions parallel to the stress axis had longer creep life than transverse specimens with overlapped typical-shape beads. Longitudinal weld specimens showed higher strain to failure than transverse specimens. The microstructural investigation of creep tested P 91 weld metal revealed two primary modes of creep fractures. In addition to creep fractures along columnar grain boundaries (typical of weld metal creep failure), creep fractures were also found along creep-weak white-bands which had formed at the inter-bead boundaries. The white-band regions consisted of material where the M 23 C 6 carbides had dissolved during creep testing; the loss of carbides had allowed recrystallisation of the martensitic structure to ferrite and consequently this material was much softer than the bulk weld metal. The element mapping over the weld metal by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) demonstrated that there was significant inhomogeneity {{in the distribution of}} certain elements, most significantly, chromium, manganese and molybdenum. This inhomogeneity resulted in strong activity gradients in carbon (even though the carbon concentration was homogeneous following welding) resulting in carbon loss from the alloy-depleted regions, the associated dissolution of carbides and the recrystallisation that accompanied this, and thus the poor mechanical properties which resulted in creep failure. The inhomogeneity in the distribution of certain alloying elements can be partially attributed to the solute partition of alloying elements during weld solidification which has been confirmed with examination of simulation P 91 TIG welds. However, the homogeneity of weld metal in this case required mixing of a base steel (the <b>core</b> <b>rod</b> in the weld consumable) and particles of various ferro-alloys (delivered into the weld pool from the flux). It is argued that poor mixing in the stagnant layer (unmixed zone) at the solid-liquid interface during weld solidification also makes a significant contribution to the formation of alloy-depleted regions. The formation of white-bands has been modelled using Thermo-Calc based on the understanding of the formation mechanism involving solute partition and subsequent carbon diffusion out of the alloy-depleted region. A good correlation to experimental results has been shown in the prediction of limiting carbon concentration and M 23 C 6 carbide content in white-bands. In addition, it was also suggested that depletion of carbides and carbon are strongly linked and that depletion of alloying elements only above a critical value will result in total carbide loss and thus recrystallisation into a white-band...|$|E

40|$|The guided-wave laser {{is almost}} {{as old as the}} laser itself. The first {{demonstration}} of laser action in glass made use of a multimode waveguide; a <b>core</b> <b>rod</b> encased in a cladding of lower refractive index so that confinement of the light would counteract the effect of the poor optical quality of the available glass, (Snitzer, 1961). However, although waveguiding has long been an essential feature of semiconductor diode lasers, in dielectric laser media by far the greatest research effort has gone into the development of bulk rods and slabs of high optical quality. Interest in the potential advantages of guided wave dielectric gain media was only quickened with the advent of high quality single mode optical waveguides, especially rare earth doped silica fibres, in which the propagation losses are so low that the benefits of optical confinement are fully realised. The most immediate advantage of the guided-wave geometry is that of reducing the cavity mode volume, and hence the pump power needed to reach threshold. Provided the guiding structure is designed so as to support only a single propagating mode at the gain wavelength, then the laser output will be spatially coherent, in a mode that is not affected, for example, by cavity misalignment. The guided-wave laser can be designed as a compact, stable, monolithic device, exploiting all the techniques of integrated optics, such as gratings, couplers, and modulators. Since the active region of a guided-wave laser is typically only a few µm in diameter, fabrication can involve a range of deposition techniques very different from those used to grow bulk media. The resulting gain medium may have a composition or dopant concentration not available to a bulk phase. On the other hand the advantages of a guided-wave structure are cancelled if propagation losses compete too effectively with the achievable gain. A further difficulty attending these optically pumped devices is the need to couple pump light into the waveguide core. The pump sources themselves must therefore emit spatially coherent beams, and expensive micropositioning techniques are required. The literature on fibre and planar dielectric waveguide lasers is now so extensive that a review of this type cannot attempt to be comprehensive. My aim is rather to sketch the principles of guided-wave laser design and operation, and introduce a few selected devices of particular current interest. I shall pay particular attention to the role that guided-wave systems may play in the effort to develop compact and efficient sources emitting high power diffraction-limited beams. Diode-bar lasers emitting many tens of watts are now readily available, but it remains a challenge to convert the highly asymmetric and multimode output from such a device into a usable beam in a simple and efficient way. It is not at first sight obvious that a guided wave laser should be particularly suitable for high power operation. Waveguides are characteristically devices in which high core intensity accompanies low overall power, and scaling up the core area leads to multimode propagation and loss of spatial coherence. Recently, however, the technique of cladding pumping of fibre lasers {{has been found to be}} strikingly effective in overcoming these limitations. It can be argued that planar waveguide structures are inherently highly compatible with high-power diode-bar pump lasers. Experimental investigation of such devices indicates that extremely compact sources, potentially able to handle 10 W or more of output, can be fabricated in this way. Control of the spatial mode is a central and difficult problem, and various technical approaches will be reviewed. Equally stringent is the necessity to couple pump radiation into the guide, whether longitudinally for greater efficiency, or transversely for a less divergent output and the possibility of power scaling. We shall see that with careful positioning this can be achieved without the use of any optical components whatsoever. If, moreover, the cladding-pumping principle is employed, then the position tolerances are significantly relaxed. Alternatively it may be possible to pump through the face of the device, and we shall review some practical schemes of this typ...|$|E
