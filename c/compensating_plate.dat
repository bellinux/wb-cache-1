5000|$|White {{light has}} a tiny {{coherence}} length and {{is difficult to}} use in a Michelson (or Mach-Zehnder) interferometer. Even a narrowband (or [...] "quasi-monochromatic") spectral source requires careful attention to issues of chromatic dispersion when used to illuminate an interferometer. The two optical paths must be practically equal for all wavelengths present in the source. This requirement can be met if both light paths cross an equal thickness of glass of the same dispersion. In Fig. 4a, the horizontal beam crosses the beam splitter three times, while the vertical beam crosses the beam splitter once. To equalize the dispersion, a so-called <b>compensating</b> <b>plate</b> identical to the substrate of the beam splitter may be inserted {{into the path of}} the vertical beam. In Fig. 4b, we see using a cube beam splitter already equalizes the pathlengths in glass. The requirement for dispersion equalization is eliminated by using extremely narrowband light from a laser.|$|E

This device {{consists of}} a moving optical wedge (MOW), a fixed optical wedge (FOW), a fixed <b>compensating</b> <b>plate,</b> and a beam-splitting cube. The optical path difference (OPD) is calculated and analyzed. The factor between the OPD and the displacement of the MOW is less than 1 if the refractive index and wedge angle of the MOW and FOW are chosen properly. Therefore, the CMOWI is insensitive to scanning speed variations compared with the traditional Michelson interferometer. The CMOWI is compact, small-sized, and suitable for low-resolution Fourier transform spectroscopy...|$|E

50|$|The Rayleigh {{interferometer}} employs two {{beams of}} light from a single source, and determines the difference in optical path length between the two paths using interference between the two beams when they are recombined following traversal of the paths. An example {{is shown in the}} figure. Light from a source (top) is collimated by a lens and split into two beams using slits. The beams are sent through two different paths and pass through <b>compensating</b> <b>plates.</b> They are brought to a focus by a second lens (bottom) where an interference pattern is observed to determine the optical path difference in terms of wavelengths of the light.|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of interferometer, the moving-optical-wedge interferometer, is presented, and its {{principle}} and properties are studied. The novel interferometer consists of one beam splitter, two flat fixed mirrors, two fixed <b>compensating</b> <b>plates,</b> one fixed optical wedge, and one moving optical wedge. The optical path difference (OPD) {{as a function of}} the displacement of the moving optical wedge from the zero path difference position is accomplished by the straight reciprocating motion of the moving optical wedge. A large physical shift of the moving optical wedge corresponds to a very short OPD value of the new interferometer if the values of the wedge angle and the refractive index of the two optical wedges are given properly. The new interferometer is not so sensitive to the velocity variation of the moving optical wedge and the mechanical disturbances compared with the Michelson interferometer, and it is very applicable to low-spectral-resolution application for any wavenumber region from the far infrared down to the ultraviolet.

40|$|The IASI {{instrument}} (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) is a Fourier-Transform Spectrometer (FTS) providing {{spectra of}} the Earth's atmosphere observed from space. The {{heart of the}} instrument is a Michelson interferometer (IHOS) equipped with hollow cube-corners retro-reflectors {{in place of the}} classical flat mirrors. One of the most critical components of the IHOS is its infrared beamsplitter dividing and recombining the incident rays in order to create the interferograms. The beamsplitter chromatism must not exceed a quarter-wave, while the required transmission efficiency should ideally be higher than 0. 35 over the whole instrument spectral domain (ranging from 3. 6 to 15. 5 µm), with a particular emphasis on the radiometric performance between 14 and 15. 5 µm due to mission constraints. Practically, it would dictate the choice of the Potassium Bromide material (KBr) for the plates substrate, however this material presents severe moisture and mechanical constraints. This is the reason why we have looked for an alternative solution based on the use of thin ZnSe plates. Theoretical analyses and numerical examples of the beamsplitter radiometric and chromatic performance confirm that this design is feasible for two different geometrical configurations: a classical beamsplitter with grouped parallel plates, and a rather unusual design including a remote <b>compensating</b> <b>plate</b> which will be set perpendicular to the transmitted optical beam...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of modern {{high power laser}} systems allows single pass welding of thick-walled components with minimal distortion. Besides the high demands on the joint preparation, the hydrostatic pressure in the melt pool increases with higher plate thicknesses. Reaching or exceeding the Laplace pressure, drop-out or melt sagging are caused. A contactless electromagnetic weld support system was used for laser beam welding of thick ferromagnetic steel <b>plates</b> <b>compensating</b> these effects. An oscillating magnetic field induces eddy currents in the weld pool which generate Lorentz forces counteracting the gravity forces. Hysteresis effects of ferromagnetic steels are considered {{as well as the}} loss of magnetization in zones exceeding the Curie temperature. These phenomena reduce the effective Lorentz forces within the weld pool. The successful compensation of the hydrostatic pressure was demonstrated on up to 20 mm thick plates of duplex and mild steel by a variation of the electromagnetic power level and the oscillation frequency...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{automatic}} {{compensation of}} strong thermal lensing in a suspended 80 m optical cavity with sapphire test mass mirrors. Variation of the transmitted beam spot size {{is used to}} obtain an error signal to control the heating power applied to the cylindrical surface of an intracavity compensation plate. The negative thermal lens created in the compensation <b>plate</b> <b>compensates</b> the positive thermal lens in the sapphire test mass, which {{was caused by the}} absorption of the high intracavity optical power. The results show that feedback control is feasible to compensate the strong thermal lensing expected to occur in advanced laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Compensation allows the cavity resonance to be maintained at the fundamental mode, but the long thermal time constant for thermal lensing control in fused silica could cause difficulties with the control of parametric instabilities.

40|$|Radially and azimuthally {{polarized}} beams have {{applications in}} laser technology, such as material processing and microscopy. Radially and azimuthally polarized beams {{have been produced}} using liquid crystal polarization converters created through the photoalignment of a coumarin-based photopolymer. In devices assembled with two substrates and nematic liquid crystals in the intersubstrate gap, the nematic liquid crystal molecules align along dimers produced by photoalignment at the surface of each substrate. Radial alignment is achieved by inducing a radial dimerization on one substrate by rotation of the polarization during UV exposure. A defect {{in the way the}} liquid crystals align themselves alters the final polarization state by 180 ° across the disclination line. A π phase step <b>plate</b> <b>compensates</b> for this defect, producing useful radially and azimuthally polarized fields. This investigation focused on integrating this π phase step plate into the polarization converter. Devices with integrated internal and integrated external phase step plates were fabricated and characterized. Characterization data were taken on a transmission set-up at 1053 nm. Far field and near field measurements were taken. The expected properties of radial polarization were seen in the far field of devices with an integrated external phase plate.

40|$|Smart antenna {{technology}} is a challenging area {{in the development of}} wireless communications. Using smart antennas the quality of a radio link can be improved by many ways. Smart antennas are active antenna arrays or groups with changeable complex-valued weights at inputs and outputs. Good electrical matching of the array and the similarity and ideality of element patterns is usually expected. This dissertation focuses on the problems in the smart antenna arrays caused mainly by mutual coupling. Mutual coupling causes reflected power in the feeding system, input/output signal correlation and corruption of the element patterns. The arrays used in this thesis are small microstrip arrays. The used frequency is about 5. 3  GHz. For several arrays the element patterns and scattering matrices are measured and used in calculations and measurements. Also simulated patterns and scattering matrices are used. Due to mutual coupling the element patterns in an array are usually corrupted and therefore pattern correction should be used in smart antennas to improve the use of adaptive algorithms. In linear pattern correction the element patterns are reshaped using all antenna elements in the array. It is a computational method using a correction matrix between true and idealized inputs/outputs of array branches. For this pattern correction two basically different methods are used. The least squares error method can be used to find the correction matrix if the actual element patterns and the wanted element patterns are known, whereas in the scattering matrix method the correction matrix is defined only with the scattering matrix. These methods are compared in this thesis and the least squares error method is found to result in clearly better array patterns. The disadvantage of the scattering matrix method {{is that it does not}} <b>compensate</b> ground <b>plate</b> diffraction. However, the scattering matrix is easier to obtain than the element patterns and its use can give better understanding of the coupling mechanisms and therefore help the antenna design. Thus its use in pattern correction is examined more accurately. An extension of the least squares pattern correction method is done by correcting the array to a virtual array with different element spacing. The results show, that the element spacing in the virtual array should not differ significantly from the spacing in the real array. In addition to the pattern correction with a correction matrix the use of the real patterns for beamforming is examined. In a modified least squares method for beamforming the weighting (cost function) is used. The beamforming with and without robust weighting is compared on the relative scale and the use of weighting give better results. When antenna elements in an array are placed closer to each other, mutual coupling increases. At the same time the correlation between received signals increases. However, the signal correlation is usually caused by the signal propagation, and the effect of mutual coupling is minor. But, when signals arrive from many different directions, the pattern correlation caused by mutual coupling gives a realistic estimate of the signal correlation. The pattern correlation is a pure array characteristic and can be found easily. In this thesis the connection between pattern correlation and mutual coupling is examined. Equations are derived for this connection using scattering parameters or reflected power. These equations allow estimate mutual coupling from pattern correlation and vice versa, which is important for antenna array development. A more detailed formulation of the connection is done for lossless two-element arrays. In practice, when there are losses in the array, mutual coupling is not necessarily usable in estimation of pattern correlation. reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|For the Astrographic Catalogue, 20 {{observatories}} {{from around}} the world participated in exposing and measuring more than 22,000 glass plates (see table). Around half of the observatories ordered telescopes from the Henry brothers (Paul and Prosper) in France, with others coming from the factory of Howard Grubb of Dublin. These telescopes were termed normal astrographs with an aperture of around 13 inches (33 cm) and a focal length of 11 feet (3.4 m) designed to create images with a uniform scale on the photographic plate of approximately 60 arcsecs/mm while covering a 2° × 2° field of view. Each observatory was assigned a specific declination zone to photograph. The first such plate was taken in August 1891 at the Vatican Observatory (where the exposures took more than 27 years to complete), and the last in December 1950 at the Ukkel Observatory (Brussels), with most observations being made between 1895 and 1920. To <b>compensate</b> for <b>plate</b> defects, each area of the sky was photographed twice, using a two-fold, corner-to-centre overlap pattern, extended at the zone boundaries, such that each observatory's plates would overlap with those of the adjacent zones. The participating observatories agreed to use a standardized telescope so that all plates had a similar scale of approximately 60 arcsec/mm. The measurable areas of the plates were 2.1°×2.1° (13 cm×13 cm), so the overlap pattern consisted of plates that were centred on every degree band in declination, but offset in right ascension by two degrees. Many factors, such as reference catalogue, reduction technique and print formats were left up to the individual institutions. The positional accuracy goal was 0.5 arcsec per image. Plate measurement was a protracted affair, with measuring done by eye and recorded by hand. The plates were turned over to a large number of semi-skilled [...] "computers" [...] to determine the positions of the stars on each plate. (Before its modern meaning, the word [...] "computer" [...] meant a person who performs calculations). The [...] "computers" [...] would manually measure each star with respect to the dozen or so reference stars within that particular plate, and then perform calculations to determine the star's right ascension and declination. The original goal of 11 mag for the limiting magnitude was generally surpassed, however, with some observatories routinely measuring stars as faint as 13 mag. In total, some 4.6 million stars (8.6 million images) were observed. The brightest stars were over-exposed on the plates, not measured, and therefore missing in the resulting catalogues. The plate measurements (as rectangular coordinates), as well as the formulae to transform them to equatorial coordinates, were published in the original volumes of the Astrographic Catalogue, although the accompanying equatorial coordinates are now of only historical interest. Publication of the measurements proceeded from 1902 to 1964, and resulted in 254 printed volumes of raw data. [...] For decades the Astrographic Catalogue was largely ignored. The data were difficult to work with because they were available neither in machine-readable form nor in equatorial coordinates. Decades of labour were expended internationally before the project was superseded by modern astronomical techniques. One problem was that the work took much longer than expected. As originally envisaged, the project was meant to have taken only 10 to 15 years. A more serious problem was that while many European astronomers were preoccupied with this project, which required steady, methodical labor rather than creativity, {{in other parts of the}} world notably the United States astrophysics was becoming far more important than astrometry. As a result, French astronomy in particular fell behind and lagged for decades.|$|R
40|$|Around {{the end of}} {{the sixties}} and the {{beginning}} of the seventies, scientific results of innumerable oceanographic cruises allowed researchers of the Lamont-Doherty Observatory of Columbia University to identify and date the principal magnetic lineations of the Central and Northern Atlantic and to propose a quite reliable reconstruction of the ocean spreading (Pitman & Talwani 1972). Once the parameters of the relative motion between Europe and America and between Africa and America had been determined, it was possible to calculate virtual poles and finite rotation angles representative of the Africa-Europe interaction through discrete time intervals (Dewey et al. 1973). In an approach of global tectonics, the Atlantic Ocean was regarded as a first-order kinematic system entirely controlling the Alpine tectonic evolution of the Mediterranean region. Through the whole time span ranging from the late early Jurassic to the Oligocene, the fit between computed and observed data resulted excellent. Starting from the Oligocene/Miocene boundary, however, a dominant misfit was found over most of the Central and Western Mediterranean region, with the exception of the Alps where predictions were not contradicted by regional geology. The misfit regarded both the directions and the magnitudes of the slip vectors, with angular deviations as great as 90 ° and slip rates in excess of 500 per cent. After the basic work of Pitman & Talwani (1972) new data on the Atlantic have been produced and new kinematic models have been proposed on the post-Oligocene evolution of the Mediterranean region (see, among many others, Biju-Duval et al. 1977; Livermore & Smith 1985; Dercourt et al. 1986; Savostin et al. 1986; Dewey et al. 1989; Mazzoli & Helman 1994) but a lot of misfit between prediction and observed data still persisted. Starting from the second half of the seventies, the introduction of the rollback mechanism (Malinverno & Ryan 1986) provided new conceptual tools for solving the discrepancy between predictions derived from global tectonics and facts observed in regional geology (e. g. Patacca & Scandone 1989; Gueguen et al. 1989; Rosenbaum & Lister 2004). Global tectonics defines boundary conditions and provides thus important constraints for any palinspastic restoration, but cannot predict the role of the flexure retreat of the lower plate. Rollback mechanisms, on the other side, control the flexure-hinge retreat in the lower plate and the related kinematic parameters (extension in backarc basins, shortening and consequent forward migration of the compression front in thrust belts). In the case of passive lithosphere sinking, high-rate flexure-hinge retreat may be responsible for remarkable extension in backarc regions and severe shortening in the mountain chain, with a forward migration of the thrust belt-foredeep system at rates several times greater than the plate-convergence rate. 	In this presentation we will describe the geological evolution of the peri-Tyrrhenian region starting from middle/late Oligocene times, when two orogenic belts having opposite sense of subduction were developed east of Corsica-Sardinia and in the Alps, separated by a transform fault zone in correspondence to the Tertiary Piedmont-Liguria basin. During the Oligocene, both systems behaved as neutral arc, with <b>plate</b> convergence <b>compensated</b> by flexure-hinge retreat and with opposite forward migration of the thrust belt-foredeep-foreland systems. Starting from the Oligocene/Miocene boundary, the high-rate flexure-hinge retreat of the Africa <b>plate</b> not <b>compensated</b> by <b>plate</b> convergence brought to the opening of the Western Mediterranean and Tyrrhenian basins. We have used four principal parameters: •	Vectors describing the Africa-Europe interaction deduced from the spreading history of the Atlantic, derived from the geological literature; •	Velocity of the flexure-hinge retreat estimated from original data on the forward migration of the Apennine foredeep basins across restored balanced sections; •	Velocity of shortening, estimated from original data on the times of incorporation in the thrust belt of foreland domains across the same restored balanced sections; •	Velocity of extension of the Western Mediterranean and Tyrrhenian post-collisional basins deduced from the available literature. Flexure-hinge retreat, reaching rates 5 - 6 times higher than the Africa-Europe convergence, was the dominant parameter in the tectonic evolution of the study area...|$|R
