40|$|Direct {{investment}} is {{the category of}} international investment that reflects the objective of an entity resident in one economy obtaining a lasting interest in an enterprise resident in another economy.

Direct investment covers the <b>cross-border</b> <b>transactions</b> of entities that are in a direct investment relationship—in other words, direct investment covers the <b>cross-border</b> <b>transactions</b> with the subsidiaries, associates and branches either directly or indirectly owned by a direct investor, as well as the <b>cross-border</b> <b>transactions</b> among the affiliated group of direct investment enterprises.

40|$|Using a {{panel of}} {{corporate}} transactions in 27 EU countries from 1999 to 2012, we investigate {{the impact of the}} financial crisis on the market for corporate assets. In particular, we test the ‘fire-sale FDI’ hypothesis by analyzing the number of <b>cross-border</b> <b>transactions,</b> the price of corporate assets and the impact of credit and macroeconomic conditions. According to the fire-sale FDI hypothesis, countries affected by a crisis attract foreign buyers selling assets at a discount. We find a dampening effect of the crisis on <b>cross-border</b> <b>transactions</b> in all EU countries. Although countries with higher sovereign default risk and lower economic demand attracted more foreign buyers in the crisis, lower domestic credit is associated with less <b>cross-border</b> <b>transactions.</b> Corporate assets in crisis countries are cheaper, particularly if domestic credit is low; however, these findings are not limited to the crisis period. This pattern is strikingly different from the East Asian and Latin American financial crises. Overall, we find little evidence for ‘fire-sale FDI’ suggesting an integrated European market without significant frictions...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{agri-food}} {{chains are}} more global {{than ever and}} are characterized by increased imports and exports and global sourcing of products, resulting in increased <b>cross-border</b> <b>transaction</b> risks. The objective {{of this paper is}} to identify the typical risks regarding agri-food supply chains involved in <b>cross-border</b> <b>transactions</b> and to assess their importance as perceived by agri-food managers. The analysis takes into consideration four different agrifood value chains (meat, grain, olive oil, fresh vegetables and fruits). Following an explorative approach and a qualitative technique, a series of face to face in-depth interviews was conducted. Results indicate that risk perception may be quite different across countries, value chains, tiers of the supply chain, as well as across respondents. The prevalence of Market dynamics risks was pointed out in most of the interviews, yielding the impression that many operators identify the market as the most difficult environment. Differences in risk perception between fresh produce (fruit/vegetables and meat) and processed food chains (grain and olive oil) are probably interrelated to the different degree of integration within these supply chains, the different level of standardization achieved and the different causes of risks that are inherent to the nature of the product. Perceived Risks, <b>Cross-Border</b> <b>Transactions,</b> Agri-Food Chains, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R

The thesis also examines the impact of <b>cross-border</b> <b>transactions</b> on TSE-listed firms. The evidence suggests that cash offers generate consistently higher abnormal returns, higher trading activity, and lower bid-ask spreads around the announcement of takeovers than do stock exchange offers. The difference between cash and stock exchange offers is explained by capital gains tax liabilities and the information asymmetry associated with the method of payment. The intensity of merger activity also impacts the abnormal returns and the bid-ask spreads around the announcement dates. Finally, the evidence suggests that the announcement of <b>cross-border</b> <b>transactions</b> has a strong market impact...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Cross-border {{private equity}} flows have {{increased}} substantially in recent years. This study analyzes how {{the development and}} the structure of local private equity industries affect the size and style of international private equity flows using a unique cross-border bilateral country dataset. We put particular emphasis on the role of networks among local private equity investors. Our results on the size of international private equity flows indicate that the number of <b>cross-border</b> <b>transactions</b> between two countries increases with network intensities and size of the private equity industries in both countries. Our findings related to the style of cross-border deals show that strong local ties and mature private equity industry implicate also intensive networking with private equity investors coming from abroad. In summary, our results suggest that the structure of local private equity industries matters for the size and style of <b>cross-border</b> <b>transactions...</b>|$|R
40|$|This Paper {{studies the}} {{determinants}} of mergers and acquisitions around the world during the 1990 s by focusing on differences in laws and regulation across countries. We find that the volume of M&A activity and the premium paid are significantly larger in countries with better investor protection. This result indicates that an active market for mergers and acquisitions is a more {{important component of the}} corporate governance regime of countries with better investor protection. We also show that in cross-border deals, the targets are typically from countries with poorer investor protection than the acquirers. Hence, <b>cross-border</b> <b>transactions</b> play a governance role by improving the degree of investor protection within target firms. This finding suggests that an increase in <b>cross-border</b> <b>transactions</b> may generate a worldwide convergence of corporate governance systems. corporate governance; investor protection; mergers and acquisitions...|$|R
