2500|$|A weight harness usually {{consists}} of a belt around the waist holding pouches for the weights, with shoulder straps for extra support and security. Often a velcro flap holds the weights in place. They have handles, which must be pulled to drop the weights in an emergency [...] or to remove the weights when exiting the water. A weight harness allows the weights to be comfortably carried lower on the body than a weight belt, which must be high enough to be supported by the hips. This is an advantage for divers who have no discernible waist, or whose waist is too high to trim correctly if a weight belt is worn. These advantages may also be available on some styles of integrated BC weights. A weight harness may also incorporate a <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> or straps to prevent weight shift if the diver is in a steep head down posture.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second section}} of webbing forms a <b>crotch</b> <b>strap,</b> {{running from the}} bottom of the backplate, between the diver’s legs, and up to the waist strap, which would be passed through a loop at the front end of the <b>crotch</b> <b>strap.</b> This harness is {{sometimes}} referred to as a one-piece harness, due to the shoulder and waist straps being made from a single piece of webbing.|$|E

500|$|Upon impact, a {{joint in}} the crash barrier parted, the {{suspension}} of the vehicle went under the barrier, and the car hit a stanchion head-on. The front end was destroyed. Rindt was {{in the habit of}} using only four points on the five-point harness then available and did not wear the <b>crotch</b> <b>straps,</b> as he {{wanted to be able to}} exit the car quickly in the event of fire. [...] As a result, upon impact he slid under the belts and suffered fatal throat injuries. Later investigations found that the accident was initiated by a failure of the car's right front brake shaft, but that Rindt's death was caused by poorly installed crash barriers.|$|R
50|$|The new Lotus 72 {{was a very}} {{innovative}} car, featuring {{torsion bar}} suspension, hip-mounted radiators, inboard front brakes and an overhanging rear wing. The 72 originally had suspension problems, and Jochen Rindt took a lucky victory in Monaco in the old 49 when Jack Brabham crashed on the last lap while leading. But when antidive and antisquat were designed out of the suspension, the car quickly showed its superiority, and Rindt dominated the championship until he was killed at Monza when a brake shaft broke. Rindt had only recently begun to wear a shoulder harness, but refused to wear <b>crotch</b> <b>straps</b> because he felt they slowed his exit from {{the car in the}} event of fire. When the car hit the barrier head-on, Rindt submarined forward and the lap belt inflicted fatal head and neck injuries.|$|R

5000|$|The harness {{supports}} the backplate and its cargo on the diver. It is formed from one continuous length of 2 in nylon webbing secured through dedicated {{top and bottom}} slots in the back plate. The webbing must be adjustable and is secured with a single stainless steel buckle located on the diver’s right waist, this position lessens the potential of accidental opening by the <b>crotch</b> <b>strap.</b> A <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> runs {{from the bottom of}} the back plate to a loop in front that the waist strap passes through, securing the harness/back plate system to the diver. The <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> prevents the harness system from shifting and riding high on the diver. The harness supports 5 “D” rings, one placed on the divers left waist, one on each shoulder strap, and two on the <b>crotch</b> <b>strap.</b> [...] The left side waist “D” ring is used to attach the back gas SPG, stage bottles, and other gear that may be required for a particular dive. The shoulder “D” rings are used for securing the backup lights, the primary regulator when not in use, and temporary storage of other pieces of equipment. The front <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> “D” ring is to be used solely for attachment to a DPV (scooter), and the rear “D” ring is used for attaching equipment as needed. The primary light battery canister is placed on the waist belt on the right, secured with a secondary stainless steel belt buckle or the primary belt buckle as best suits the size of canister and diver.|$|E
50|$|Chap {{boots are}} {{a form of}} footwear. They are tall boots which cover the whole leg up to the <b>crotch,</b> with a <b>strap</b> {{attached}} to the outer side. These straps consist of a loop of material through which a belt is threaded to hold the boots up. Thus the boots act similarly {{to a pair of}} chaps. Such boots are often seen as part of boot fetishism.|$|R
5000|$|A {{loose-fitting}} BC {{without a}} <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> may slide up the diver {{and fail to}} keep {{his head out of}} the water at the surface.|$|E

50|$|A <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> may be {{included}} in the harness to prevent the BC from sliding towards the head when the diver is upright and the bladder is inflated.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, racial riots {{against the}} ethnic Chinese in West Java {{prompted}} {{the production and}} sale of [...] "anti-rape corsets". These were Florentine-type belts of imitation leather-covered plastic, fastened with a combination lock. The belts had a solid <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> without holes, and were intended only for brief outings.|$|E
50|$|BC {{attachment}} {{systems are}} generally intended {{to limit the}} shifting of the BC {{as a result of}} the lifting forces, including minimizing the tendency to slide towards the head when the diver is upright while the bladder is inflated. If the diver is wearing a weight belt, this will pull in the opposite direction to BC lift when the diver is upright, and can result in the diver sagging down in the jacket when floating at the surface. Solutions to this problem include the cummerbund (a broad adjustable waist band) and the <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> (a strap between the legs). The <b>crotch</b> <b>strap,</b> when adjusted correctly, is effective at preventing this shift, but may prevent the weight belt from falling clear of the diver if dropped in an emergency. Fitting the weight belt over the <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> after putting the BC on can be difficult. The cummerbund is an attempt to avoid this problem, as the weight belt can not be snagged on it in the same way, but the weight belt must then be worn either under the cummerbund, obstructing access to the buckle, or below the cummerbund. The effectiveness of a cummerbund depends on a waistline which is smaller than the circumference of the upper torso, and it may constrain free breathing if fitted too tightly.|$|E
50|$|On June 19, 2005, Ben Bradshaw from Australia {{performed}} a Posey straitjacket escape using four backstraps, an arm loop, a <b>crotch</b> <b>strap,</b> arm straps and self-tightening clasps. He {{managed to escape}} {{in a time of}} 50.08 seconds on the Guinness World Records studio in Sydney, beating the previous 81.24-second record by David Straitjacket.|$|E
50|$|D-rings {{are usually}} fitted to the waistbelt, {{shoulder}} straps and <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> to secure stage cylinders, additional equipment, and clipping off demand valves, light heads, and submersible pressure gauges {{which are not}} currently being used. The number and position of these D-rings can be adjusted by the user, {{but there are a}} few positions which have become fairly standard.|$|E
5000|$|A tight cummerbund may {{restrict}} {{the ability of}} the diver to breathe freely. As the work of breathing increases with depth this may result in ineffective ventilation leading to carbon dioxide buildup, toxicity, a desperate urge to breathe, hyperventilation and eventually panic. Panic underwater has been associated with many fatalities. A <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> eliminates the need for a cummerbund, but a cummerbund is more easily adjusted to fit the diver.|$|E
50|$|Lights: Sidemount divers {{who enter}} {{overhead}} environments will typically carry a primary torch, often of umbilical/canister design, {{along with one}} or two back-up torches. Specific sidemount umbilical/canister torches are now sold, with a 90 degree junction for the umbilical which permits them to be mounted on the butt-plate or upper-rear <b>crotch</b> <b>strap.</b> Back-up torches are typically a robust LED design, with a battery/burn life indicated to be 2-3x that of the planned dive duration.|$|E
50|$|The ABLJ was {{developed}} by Maurice Fenzy in 1961. Early versions were inflated by mouth underwater. Later versions had their own air inflation cylinder. Some had carbon dioxide inflation cartridges (a holdover, for surface use, of the Mae West flyer's lifejacket) to facilitate emergency ascent. This was abandoned when valves that allowed divers to breathe from the BC's inflation bag were introduced. The Fenzy ABLJ provided a proof of concept for buoyancy compensation, however the large-volume ring behind the diver's neck caused the jacket to ride up against the diver's throat, despite the <b>crotch</b> <b>strap.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The knife {{is carried}} {{in an open}} sheath on the waist belt {{to the left of}} the <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> where it can be reached by either hand and is {{unlikely}} to snag. It is a line cutting tool and does not need to be large or to have a point, but must have a sharp edge that is effective on thin lines and nets. [...] Paramedic shears and purpose designed line cutters can be kept in a wetsuit/ drysuit pocket if there is a high risk of entanglement.|$|E
50|$|The {{backplate}} {{is usually}} {{made from a}} single piece of stainless steel or anodised aluminium, bent along four lines to form a channel running vertically down the center. The plate is about 15” (38 cm) long and 10” (25 cm) wide. There are two slots near each of the shoulders and hips, where the harness passes through, and another slot {{at the bottom of the}} plate where the <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> attaches. There is also one or more pairs of holes in the channel to be used for cylinder attachment; the holes of each pair are 11” apart.|$|E
50|$|This {{tendency}} of the inflated BC to shift towards the head {{is less of a}} problem when the weights are carried in integrated weight pockets on the BC, but it may then have a tendency to slide towards the head when deflated on an inverted diver underwater. This is less of a problem for the average recreational diver, who does not spend much time head down underwater, but can increase the difficulty of recovering from a dry-suit inversion where the air in the suit flows to the feet and the weights in the BC shift towards the head. A <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> will prevent this.|$|E
50|$|A webbing harness with {{shoulder}} straps, {{waist belt}} and <b>crotch</b> <b>strap,</b> supporting {{a variety of}} sliders and D-rings for attachment of cylinders and accessories, with or without integrated weighting or separate weight belts, and {{with or without a}} back mounted buoyancy compensator, which may be attached to the harness, or directly to the diver. Cylinders are usually attached to a shoulder or chest D-ring and waist belt D-ring on each side. Additional accessories may include canister lights and clip-on pockets for small equipment. This style of harness may be off the shelf from an original equipment manufacturer or retailer, or home made, as most of the parts are freely available or relatively simple to make.|$|E

5000|$|For {{a jacket}} without a front strap, {{the most common}} way to escape is to hoist the arms over the head before undoing the <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> and at last the strap {{at the back of}} the neck. This allows the jacket to simply be peeled off upward over the head. The straitjacket escape was popularized by Houdini, who [...] "discovered" [...] it. Houdini first did it behind a curtain, forcing the {{audience}} to listen to thumps while watching a billowing curtain for many minutes. He found the trick went over better when the audience could see his struggles. In a few of his later and more popular acts, he performed the straitjacket escape while hung upside down from a crane, and also did the same when placed in a sealed milk can which was filled. Houdini's (and many other illusionists) acts shown the straitijacket in action, many ways possible.|$|E
5000|$|On July 23, 2013, Alexanderia the Great {{performed}} an underwater straitjacket escape {{in a small}} bullet-proof clear tank in full view for America's Got Talent, live on stage at Radio City Music Hall. Billed as a combination of two of Houdini's greatest escapes (The Straitjacket and The Milk Can or Water Cell escapes), Alexanderia was put into a regulation Houdini straitjacket, with 5 leather straps including a <b>crotch</b> <b>strap.</b> The straitjacket was then secured with an additional 25 feet of 1/4 inch steel chain. A padlock was secured each time the chains were wrapped around her body and arms, {{resulting in a total}} of 5 padlocks. Alexanderia then went into a small (3x3) clear bullet-proof (Lexan) tank filled with water. The lid to the tank was padlocked shut, forcing her underwater with no way to breathe. Unlike any of Houdini's Milk Can or Water Cell escapes, no curtains were used to hide the method of escape.|$|E
50|$|For 2008, Valsecchi {{competed in}} both the GP2 Series and the new GP2 Asia Series for the Durango team, {{alongside}} Alberto Valerio. In qualifying for {{the second round of}} the GP2 Series at Istanbul, he crashed heavily at 175 mph, but escaped serious injury. However, he did not take part in the rest of the race meeting. Although the car was badly damaged in the crash, GP2 technical director Didier Perrin suspected a braking problem. Valsecchi's evacuation from the wreckage was also hampered by his <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> becoming wedged between the foam seat and the chassis, resulting in a technical bulletin being circulated amongst the GP2 teams with instructions on how to fit the strap correctly. Valsecchi suffered mild concussion and a spinal injury, and subsequently missed the next two rounds of the championship. His seat was taken first by compatriot Marcello Puglisi, and then by Ben Hanley. He returned to racing action for the race meeting at Silverstone, where he scored a point in the sprint race. He later crashed his car heavily during the feature race at Spa-Francorchamps, necessitating another visit to hospital, but this time he was uninjured and scored a point in the sprint race the next day. At Monza, Valsecchi won the sprint race, his first GP2 victory.|$|E
50|$|Monza {{is known}} by many Formula One enthusiasts to be a {{bittersweet}} place; and this weekend was no exception. It was {{a weekend of}} highs and lows - at this rather simple, ultra-fast circuit - when it had no chicanes of any kind, Jochen Rindt was killed on the straight going into the Parabolica on his wingless Lotus 72 - and because aerodynamic downforce was not properly understood then, the car was, according to his teammate John Miles - rather unstable and difficult to drive - but in fact, it was a brake system failure that caused Rindt to spin off and crash into some poorly installed Armco barrier, {{and as a result}} of that, the car went under the barrier and rotated a few times in the sand track. Rindt was not wearing his seat belts properly, either - in addition to the belts being loose, a <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> part of the seat belts had been introduced recently, and Rindt wasn't wearing one. As a result, he had submarined in the car and the belt buckle had slit his throat. Come race day, the race started, and Ferrari driver Clay Regazzoni won his first F1 race, and the overjoyed crowd ran onto the track and celebrated.|$|E
40|$|Paper Number 05 - 0425 The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{relative}} effectiveness of two booster seats for use by children across a wide age span, from around 3 years to 10 + years. The study was part of a broad research program to identify suitable child restraint systems (CRS) to fit a large sedan vehicle to maximise protection in a crash. Dummies were restrained in the rear seat of a vehicle buck in three restraint configurations with boosters: (i) with a standard adult lap-sash seatbelt, (ii) with a seatbelt plus H-harness and <b>crotch</b> <b>strap,</b> or (iii) with a seatbelt plus H-harness with the <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> disengaged (to simulate the effects of real-world misuse conditions), and a fourth condition (iv) with an adult seatbelt only. Boosters were fitted in the vehicle with two different anchorage systems: a standard seatbelt and a system including a retrofitted rigid ISOFIX attachment and top tether. HyGe sled tests were conducted to simulate a 64 km/h offset deformable barrier frontal impact with a change in velocity of around 71 km/h. Preliminary investigations were also conducted using side impact simulations with a change in velocity of around 15 km/h. Overall, the booster seats for both the 6 year old dummy and the 3 year old dummy when a (with harness and <b>crotch</b> <b>strap)</b> provided superior crash protection than use of the adult seatbelt. For tests when the H-harness was used to restrain the dummy, use of the <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> was critical in eliminating ‘sub-marining’. The research highlighted the potential for serious injury with misuse of child harness systems and identified several areas for design improvement of booster seats...|$|E
40|$|For full {{details on}} the {{development}} of life jackets you are referred to Designed for Life – Life jackets through the ages by this author [4]. It may not surprise you to know that pneumatic life jackets have been in existence since biblical times. There is a stone carving in the British Museum showing Assur-Nasir-Pals ’ army crossing a river or moat to attack a castle in 870 B. C. The soldiers are wearing inflated animal skins. It may also not surprise you to know that when the Dalai Lama escaped across the Bramaputra River in 1959, he also used inflated yak skins for flotation. However, while impressments existed (that is where sailors were forcibly ‘pressed ’ into service in the Royal Navy), the provision of flotation devices was not encouraged. To provide a life jacket gave the sailor the potential opportunity to escape and swim ashore. The Admiralty argued that if the ship sank, there was plenty of buoyant material on which to float or cling on to, i. e. masts, spars, wooden water barrels. The policy of impressments was not discontinued until 1815. RTO-AG-HFM- 152 9 B- 1 All You Need to Know About Life Jackets: A Tribute to Edgar Pask So there was little development of the life jacket until the mid 1800 s – but by 1811, such features as the importance of fitting the <b>crotch</b> <b>strap</b> had been recognized in life jacket design such as Mallison’s Seamen’...|$|E
