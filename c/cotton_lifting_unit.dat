40|$|The use of {{turbofan}} engines as <b>lift</b> <b>units</b> for VTOL aircraft poses {{new engine}} control problems. At low flight speeds, the <b>lift</b> <b>units</b> must provide the fast thrust response needed for aircraft attitude and height control. The {{results are presented}} of an analytical study of the dynamics and control of turbofan lift engines, and methods are proposed for meeting the response requirements imposed by the VTOL aircraft application. Two types of lift fan engines are discussed: the integral and remote. The integral engine is a conventional two-spool, high bypass ratio turbofan designed for low noise and short length. The remote engine employs a gas generator and a lift fan which are separated by a duct, and which need not be coaxial. For the integral engine, a control system design is presented which satisfies the VTOL response requirements. For the remote engine, two unconventional methods of control involving flow transfer between <b>lift</b> <b>units</b> are discussed. Both methods are shown to have thrust response near the required levels...|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of fluid lifting {{equipment}} called Balanced Oil Recovery System (trade named BORS Lift{trademark}) was installed on several idle oil wells to demonstrate the operating efficiency of this innovative equipment technology. The BORS Lift system is designed to bring oil to the surface without the accompanying formation water. The BORS Lift system uses an innovative strap mechanism that takes oil {{from the top of}} the downhole oilwater column and lifts it to the surface, eliminating production of the formation water. Eliminating salt water production could potentially increase oil production, reduce operational costs, benefit the environment, and cut salt water disposal costs. Although the BORS <b>Lift</b> <b>units</b> did not function as intended, lessons learned during the course of the field demonstration project resulted in improvements in the technology and redesign of subsequent generation BORS <b>Lift</b> <b>units</b> which are reported to have significantly improved their performance characteristics. BORS <b>Lift</b> <b>units</b> were installed on 15 temporarily abandoned wells which had been shut down due to low oil production, high water production, and uneconomic operating conditions. The wells had been producing with artificial lift at a high watercut from a shallow (850 - 900 feet), pressure depleted oil sand reservoir prior to being shut down. The electrical motor driven BORS <b>Lift</b> <b>units</b> provided a possible approach for economically returning the shallow, low-volume oil wells to production. The BORS <b>Lift</b> <b>units</b> used in this field demonstration were designed to recover up to roughly 22 barrels of fluid per day from depths ranging to 1, 700 feet, ideal for many marginal stripper well operations. The BORS units were first-production-model test units, operated under oil field conditions for the first time, and were naturally expected to experience some design problems. From the onset, the operator experienced mechanical, design, and operational problems with the BORS <b>Lift</b> <b>units</b> and was unable to maintain un-interrupted production operations. The inventor provided considerable on-site technical support in an ongoing effort to correct the problems with the units and the inventor worked extensively with the operator to make design and manufacturing changes to the units to try to improve their reliability and performance. The operational problems were mostly related to the durability of the various components under oil field operating conditions such as inadequate mechanical, electrical, and electronic design for rough service, extended operation, and severe weather conditions. During the course of the demonstration project, it further appeared that the producing formation lacked sufficient reservoir energy and/or favorable oil properties to mobilize and displace oil from the formation into the well bore in order to recharge the oil column in the well. The BORS <b>Lift</b> <b>units</b> were then moved to a second lease which appeared to have more favorable WTI quality oil properties. Eight of these units were reported to have been installed and placed in operation on the second lease, however, operational difficulties continued. It was determined that the units were inadequately designed and would need to be replace by improved second generation units. Due to the lack of success with the first generation units and the extra cost to replace them with the redesigned units, the operators decided not to continue with the project and the project was terminated at that point...|$|R

The typing is based on the dyadic product of units that is found in linear transformations and the corresponding vector spaces.

The interpretation of these predicates is then added to the input structure and their definitions are removed from the theory; the further processing is then done by the standard IDP 3 system.

This has produced a demand for tools which allow users to write high level problem specifications which are automatically reduced to SAT. We {{consider the case of}} specifications in first order logic with reduction to SAT by grounding. For realistic problems, the resulting SAT instances can be prohibitively large. A key technique in SAT solvers is unit propagation, which often significantly reduces instance size before search for a solution begins. We define ”lifted unit propagation”, which is executed before grounding. We show that instances produced by a grounding algorithm with <b>lifted</b> <b>unit</b> propagation are never larger than those produced by normal grounding followed by UP, and demonstrate experimentally that they are sometimes much smaller...|$|R
