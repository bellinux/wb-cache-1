40|$|Method 0010 train {{components}} for analysis {{with very little}} detail. 1. 2 Although this sample preparation technique is intended primarily for gas chromatography/mass spectrometric (GC/MS) analysis following Method 8270, the extracts prepared according to this method may be used with other analytical methods. The Method 0010 sampling train collects semivolatile organic compounds with boiling points above 100 EC. Some of these semivolatile organic compounds may not be amenable to gas chromatography and will require the application of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for quantitative analysis. The use of HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) is an analytical technique that may also be applied. A solvent exchange from methylene chloride to a more polar solvent such as acetonitrile or extraction with a solvent other than methylene chloride will probably be required for successful application of HPLC techniques. Some semivolatile analytes may require derivatization for successful GC/MS analysis. 1. 3 This method is restricted to use by or {{under the supervision of}} analysts experienced in the extraction and concentration of semivolatile organic compounds from the components of Method 0010 trains. Each analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results with this method. 2. 0 SUMMARY OF METHOD 2. 1 Samples generated by the Method 0010 Sampling Train (Method 0010 Sampling Train, Figure 1) are separated into six parts: a) a particulate matter filter (labeled in Method 0010 as <b>Container</b> <b>No.</b> 1); b) a front half rinse (labeled in Method 0010 as <b>Container</b> <b>No.</b> 2); c) condenser rinse and rinse of all sampling train components located between the filter and the sorbent module (labeled in Method 0010 as <b>Container</b> <b>No.</b> 5); d) sorbent trap section of the organic module (labeled in Method 0010 as Containe...|$|R
