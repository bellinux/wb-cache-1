25|$|Some bands use small notebooks, {{also known}} as a dot book or drill book, which they hang about their necks, on the drum harness, or around the waist. These contain pages of drill charts, which often either give a picture or list {{coordinates}} that band members use to find 'pages' or 'sets' on the field. Coordinates are normally listed in 8-to-5 steps off the front sideline and front and back hashes, along with the number of 8-5 steps off of the yardline listed on each page. Some bands are even using small plastic pouches that hang about their neck on an adjustable strap, which has a zipper pocket for holding drill, flags to mark sets, and a pencil. There is also a clear plastic window in front to display the <b>current</b> <b>part</b> of drill being worked on at that point in time.|$|E
2500|$|The anti-Urmuzian <b>current,</b> <b>part</b> of {{a larger}} anti-modernist campaign, found an {{unexpected}} backer in George Călinescu, who became a fellow traveler of communism. In his new interpretation, the Bizarre Pages were depicted as farcical and entirely worthless. For a while, the Bizarre Pages were only cultivated by the Romanian diaspora. Having discovered the book in interwar Romania, the dramatist and culture critic Eugène Ionesco made it his mission to highlight the connections between Urmuz and European modernism. Ionesco's work for the stage, a major contribution to the international Theater of the Absurd movement, consciously drew upon various sources, including the Romanians Ion Luca Caragiale and Urmuz. The contextual importance of such influences, which remain relatively unknown to Ionesco's international audience, has been assessed differently by the various exegetes, as Ionesco himself once stated: [...] "Nothing in Romanian literature has ever truly influenced me." [...] Thanks to Ionesco's intervention, Urmuz's works saw print in Les Lettres Nouvelles journal. Allegedly, his attempt to publish Urmuz's work with Éditions Gallimard was sabotaged by Tristan Tzara, who may have feared that previous claims about his absolute originality would come under revision. Upon translating Urmuz's writings, Ionesco also drafted the essay Urmuz ou l'Anarchiste ("Urmuz or the Anarchist", ca. 1950), with a new drawing of Urmuz by Dimitrie Vârbănescu (Guy Lévis Mano collection).|$|E

5000|$|For each object, {{you need}} to {{decouple}} its function from its form. McCaffrey (2012) shows a highly effective technique for doing so. As you break an object into its parts, ask yourself two questions. [...] "Can I subdivide the <b>current</b> <b>part</b> further?" [...] If yes, do so. [...] "Does my current description imply a use?" [...] If yes, create a more generic description involving its shape and material. For example, initially I divide a candle into its parts: wick and wax. The word [...] "wick" [...] implies a use: burning to emit light. So, describe it more generically as a string. Since [...] "string" [...] implies a use, I describe it more generically: interwoven fibrous strands. This brings to mind that I could use the wick to make a wig for my hamster. Since [...] "interwoven fibrous strands" [...] does not imply a use, I can stop working on wick and start working on wax. People trained in this technique solved 67% more problems that suffered from functional fixedness than a control group. This technique systematically strips away all the layers of associated uses from an object and its parts.|$|E
5000|$|The Nordic Seas {{exchange}} {{water with}} the North Atlantic in the upper ocean. Warm water from the North Atlantic enters the Nordic Seas from the east, specifically in the Norwegian Atlantic <b>Current</b> (<b>part</b> of the North Atlantic Current). The western boundary of the Nordic Seas is the southward-flowing East Greenland Current. This current enters through the Fram Straight from the Arctic. This current {{is considered one of}} the main ways for Arctic sea ice to be exported. The East Greenland Current splits into the Jan Mayen Current on the eastern boundary of the Nordic Seas due to bathymetry. The Jan Mayen Current plays an important role in the dense water formation that occurs in the Greenland Sea. Continuing northward, the Norwegian Atlantic Current flows along the coast of Norway to the Arctic, eventually separating into the Barents Sea and the Spitsbergen Current. There are several gyre circulations that occur in the Nordic Seas. The subsurface waters leave the Nordic Seas through the south from overflows between Greenland and Scotland. The intermediate water leaves through the Denmark Straight and the Iceland Ridge. The densest overflow waters leave through the Faroe Bank Channel.|$|E
