Despite this great effort, there is not a significant progress in order to predict the economic failure. In this way, the evidence suggests that this problem, related to the experimental design, is still present because of two main reasons: ignorance about bankruptcy process and the use of the accounting information as the unique input to construct the predictive models. In order to solve those problems, the RPV Model included both qualitative and accounting information with excellent results. So, the <b>Earning</b> <b>Power</b> Theory – upon which the RPV is based – could cause problems of specification and structure in the model.

By 1990, wages had become unequal enough that they dominated nonwage factors, so that nonworking women tended to be the ones with less earnings potential, and the wage gap between workers and nonworkers was large.

As a result we can conclude that current <b>earning</b> <b>power</b> is similar to the situation shown by Hiraishi; that large-scale farms have low efficiency and would not even meet their own operating costs in a low price economy. There is an urgent need for contemporary upland farming to improve management efficiency and to enhance profit stability.
