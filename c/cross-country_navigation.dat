5|$|When {{the parts}} for a Hamilcar were {{completed}} and the glider was erected, it was flown to RAF North Luffenham in Rutland {{to have its}} specific cargo placed on board, {{and it was then}} flown to RAF Tarrant Rushton, which had been selected as the Hamilcar training and operational base in November 1943. It was not possible to tow the glider empty, so any empty gliders usually carried Universal Carriers or concrete blocks as ballast. Training with the Hamilcar appears to have taken place primarily at RAF Tarrant Rushton, and began sometime between the end of 1943 and the first months of 1944. Hamilcar training began with dual instruction, where an instructor accompanied the pilots for several hours, and then moved onto flying solo flights. Most of this training consisted of 'circuits and bumps', where the pilots practised controlling the glider as it took off from an airfield under tow, and then landing it after the tow rope was detached; <b>cross-country</b> <b>navigation</b> was also practised. It was common practice for members of airlanded units to be inside the gliders as cargo when training took place, although there is evidence that tank crews only acted as cargo for one or two flights, probably due to the risk of accidents which might cost the lives of specialised troops and equipment. Those flights that tank crews did experience usually consisted of gliders landing on carefully marked airfields instead of the open countryside to minimise the risks involved, and also make recovery of the glider easier. Accidents do not seem to have been a common occurrence. During training by 'C' Squadron of the Glider Pilot Regiment, part of the Army Air Corps, which specialised in flying Hamilcars, over 2800 lifts were made with an average of 50 lifts per crew. Only three incidents resulted in fatalities or injuries, with seven pilots killed during the training.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Autonomous <b>navigation</b> in <b>cross-country</b> environments {{presents}} {{many new}} challenges {{with respect to}} more traditional, urban environments. The lack of highly structured components in the scene complicates the design of even basic functionalities such as obstacle detection. In addition to the geometric description of the scene, terrain typing {{is also an important}} component of the perceptual system. Recognizing the different classes of terrain and obstacles enables the path planner to choose the most efficient route toward the desired goal. This paper presents new sensor processing algorithms that are suitable for <b>cross-country</b> autonomous <b>navigation.</b> We consider two sensor systems that complement each other in an ideal sensor suite: a color stereo camera, and a single axis ladar. We propose an obstacle detection technique, based on stereo range measurements, that does not rely on typical structural assumption on the scene (such as the presence of a visible ground plane); a color-based classification system to label the detected obstacles according to a set of terrain classes; and an algorithm for the analysis of ladar data that allows one to discriminate between grass and obstacles (such as tree trunks or rocks), even when such obstacles are partially hidden in the grass. These algorithms have been developed and implemented by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) as part of its involvement in a number of projects sponsored by the US Department of Defense, and have enabled safe autonomous navigation in high-vegetated, off-road terrain...|$|R

50|$|The Surrey-Thomas Rover Crew now Surrey Thomas Rover Crew (STR) is {{best known}} for its role in the {{development}} of the sport of rogaining. The Rover Scout crew was formed in 1971 in Brighton, Australia It is part of Scouts Australia in the Australian State of Victoria. Soon after forming, the crew undertook to run an annual twenty-four-hour <b>cross-country</b> <b>navigation</b> event. At the first Surrey-Thomas twenty-four-hour rogaine in 1972, forty starters, mostly from scouting, set off from Gembrook and circled the base camp at Basan's Corner via a series of loops along forest roads. True <b>cross-country</b> <b>navigation</b> was minimal, but the publicity from the event and the emphasis placed on quality base camp service and a friendly atmosphere was sufficiently popular that there was a demand for similar events over the next two years. These were followed by an important shift to an all cross-country score event set at Yea in 1975, the first such event in the world catering for the general public. This led to the recognition that these events had a far wider appeal and marketing potential than had been previously thought and were worthy of being a sport in their own right. STR crew members then led the process by which the sport was named rogaining, rules were adopted and the world’s first rogaining association (Victorian Rogaining Association) was constituted.|$|E

5000|$|Teams {{of two to}} {{five members}} visit as many checkpoints as {{possible}} in the time allowed. Shorter duration rogaines often allow solo competitors. Checkpoints are scored differently depending on level of difficulty in reaching them; therefore teams choose a strategy (for example, to visit many low score checkpoints). Teams travel entirely on foot, navigating by map and compass between checkpoints in terrain that varies from open farmland to hilly forest. A central base camp known as a [...] "hash house" [...] provides hot meals throughout the event and teams may return at any time to eat, rest or sleep. Teams travel at their own pace and anyone from children to grandparents can experience the personal satisfaction that comes from <b>cross-country</b> <b>navigation</b> at their own level of competition and comfort. Team members stay within earshot of each other. The duration of a championship Rogaine is 24 hours, but shorter variations such as 3-, 6-, 8-, 12- and 15-hour events are also held (sometimes concurrently with a 24-hour event). Depending on the terrain, experienced rogaining teams can cover more than one hundred kilometers over the 24-hour period. There have also been longer events (dubbed [...] "Endurogaines") lasting 48 and 50 hours. In their native Australia, Rogaines are usually held every month during weekends near full moons, with annual state championships and an annual national championship. They require dozens of volunteers to run, including course setters and caterers and are often attended by hundreds of participants. A competitive 24-hour rogaine requires a map area of around 250 km2 (~ 100 mi2), for relatively flat terrain; terrain with significant climbs may require far less or far more area, depending on the placement of checkpoints.|$|E

Ongoing results are presented from the system as implemented on the NAVLAB II, an autonomous off-road vehicle at Carnegie Mellon University. The planning system was successful in achieving 5. 1 km autonomous test runs with obstacle avoidance on rugged natural terrain at speeds averaging 1. 8 m/s.

The combined disparity errors can easily exceed three-tenth’s of a pixel, which translates to a significant amount of range errors.

Methods: We undertook a mixed-method approach using quantitative (i. e. questionnaires) and qualitative (i. e. focus group discussions) methodologies to explore a population of senior orienteering athletes (n = 136, median age = 69 (67 – 71) years). Quantitative data was collected to evaluate health status, assessing physical activity (Frändin-Grimby activity scale (FGAS)), functional wellbeing (EQ- 5 D- 5 L), gut health (Gastrointestinal symptoms rating scale (GSRS)), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS)) and overall health (Health index (HI)).

40|$|Obstacle {{detection}} (OD) {{is one of}} {{the main}} components of the control system of autonomous vehicles. In the case of indoor/urban navigation, obstacles are typically defined as surface points that are higher than the ground plane. This characterisation, however, cannot be used in cross-country and unstructured environments, where the notion of "ground plane" is often not meaningful. A previous OD technique for <b>cross-country</b> <b>navigation</b> (adopted by the DEMO III experimental unmanned vehicle) computes obstacle by analysing the columns of a range image independently, looking for steps or slopes along the range profile. This procedure, however, is prone to missing obstacles with surface normal pointing away from the line of sight. We introduce a fast, fully 3 -D OD technique that overcomes such a problem, reducing the risk of false-negatives while keeping the same rate of false-positives. A simple addition to our algorithm allows one to segment obstacle points into clusters, where each cluster identifies an isolated obstacle in 3 -D space. Obstacle segmentation corresponds to finding the connected components of a suitable graph, an operation that can be performed at a minimal additional cost during the computation of obstacle points. Rule-based classification using 3 -D geometrical measures derived for each segmented obstacle is then used to reject false-obstacles (for example, objects that are small in volume, or of low height). Results for a number of scenes of natural terrain are presented, and compared with a pre-existing obstacle detection algorithm...|$|E
