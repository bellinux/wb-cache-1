We employ a difference-in-difference estimator to isolate the change in the behavior of a newly insured group (i. e., households) relative to an uninsured control group (i. e., firms). The sensitivity of households to bank capitalization diminishes markedly after the introduction of deposit insurance.

40|$|We {{examine whether}} the global {{financial}} crisis has prompted banks to take corrective action {{with regard to their}} screening and monitoring. By analyzing almost 15, 000 syndicated loans to private borrowers across 65 countries over the period 2005 - 2009, we find that banks stepped up their screening and monitoring efforts in response to the crisis. This is evidenced by a significant increase in retention rates among syndicate arrangers. These higher retention rates (‘more skin in the game’) were only partially caused by increased borrower risk. They mainly reflect a more fundamental shift towards more stringent screening and monitoring during the crisis: the wake-up <b>call</b> <b>effect.</b> ...|$|E

We answer this question using sector-based data and we propose a simple stochastic volatility model augmented with exogenous inputs (financial stress indicators in the US market). We derive analytically the autocorrelation of the squared returns using cross-moments and estimate the impact of several variables such as the CDS spreads, the ABCP spreads, market liquidity, the volatility of the S&P 500 using a Kalman filter approach with the impact captured through Almon polynomials. We find a strong evidence of persistent volatility irrespective of the sector and interpret this finding {{as the result of}} two factors: the lower liquidity of the Indian equity markets during the subprime crisis and a wake-up <b>call</b> <b>effect...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new form}} of knowledge representation for probabilistic Uncertain Causal Models. This representation allows for correlations among effects to be more easily represented than in chain rule based models, such as standard Bayesian Networks (BN's). The importance of effect correlations has been recognized {{since the early days of}} computerized causal models, especially in the medical community. Currently, when effect correlations are important, techniques based on the Bahadur expansion are usually used rather than techniques based on Bayesian Networks. This paper adds a new knowledge structure to Bayesian Networks capable of representing effect correlation. Bayesian Networks now use Conditional Probability Tables (CPT‟s) to represent uncertain causal knowledge. This paper defines an additional representation we <b>call</b> <b>Effect</b> Probability Tables (EPT's). Unlike CPT‟s, EPT‟s can efficiently represent effect correlations. We analyze the relation between EPT‟s and CPT‟s and show them to be duals when effects are conditionally independent and causes are causally independent. We present an algorithm for using both representations in the same model without requiring these independence assumptions...|$|E
40|$|The {{emphasis}} of the present thesis is on statistical methods for combining results when only published data from the individual studies are available. This is the scenario Glass (1976) had in mind defining the term meta-analysis and this {{is still the most}} common situation in research. Individual data from all the studies could clearly improve the findings from a meta-analysis, but in practice it is usually very difficult, if not impossible, to get all the data from the different experiments. The experiments or studies we are interested in are comparative studies, that is, studies in which a hypothesis is tested comparing a new intervention or treatment with a standard intervention or control. The difference or the association between the two counterparts can be modelled using a single parameter, we generally will <b>call</b> <b>effect</b> size in the following. Possible effect sizes are difference of normal means, standardized mean difference, risk difference, or odds ratio. The data situation for the meta-analysis is then that estimates of the effect size of interest are available from each study as well as estimates of the precision of each study-specific effect size estimate...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a prototype development for an interactive effect for musicians. This project {{was made with}} members of the horn section in the band Damn! They are also performing together with the Swedish hip-hop act Timbuktu. The instrument we focused on was the trombone. The trombone is played without a strap and is held and played with both hands. You use it by blowing into its mouthpiece and regulating its slide brace with one of your hands. The trombone itself is a rather long instrument and since it is not attached to your body by straps, this attribute can be an advantage when designing an interactive effect. It makes the instrument interesting for using sensors to read its position and movement (Y-axis, X-axis, and Z-axis). One sensor that we in this paper argue for is the accelerometer which proved to fit perfect for this task. The result ended up as a prototype for what we <b>call</b> <b>Effect</b> Tapper – software that {{with the help of an}} accelerometer and a tap tempo pedal let you use an interactive and controllable delay effect. In the tests with trombonist Jens Lindgård of the band Damn! we show that the prototype improved interaction, his possibility to control the effect and become more creative when playing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper uses firm-level {{information}} to evaluate how shocks are propagated internationally. It reinterprets previous theoretical work as describing five {{mechanisms by which}} a country-specific shock can be transmitted to firms around the globe. These five transmission mechanisms are: product competitiveness; an income effect; a credit crunch; a forced-portfolio recomposition; and a wake-up call. The paper then constructs a new data set of financial statistics, product information, geographic data, and stock returns for over 14, 000 companies in 46 countries. It uses this data and an event-study methodology to test what types of firms were more vulnerable to the East Asian and Russian crises. Results suggest that an income effect, forced-portfolio recomposition, and wake-up call were all important propagation mechanisms during the Russian crisis. Each of these mechanisms, as well as product competitiveness, was significant during the East Asian crisis. A credit crunch appears to have played a relatively minor role in the international propagation of shocks during both crises. Moreover, results provide preliminary evidence of {{the relative importance of}} these propagation mechanisms. The wake-up <b>call</b> <b>effect</b> can have a larger impact than all of the other mechanisms combined. The product competitiveness effect during the Asian crisis, and the income effect during the Russian crisis, are also large in magnitude. An important implication is that the relative strength of the various transmission mechanisms varies across crises, so that it is unlikely that any single model can capture how shocks are propagated during all crises. *Paper prepared for September 23 - 24 th conference "Financial Crises in Emerging Markets " at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
