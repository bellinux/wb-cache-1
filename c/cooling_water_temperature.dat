40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate the heat transfer and CO/NOX emissions of a premixed LPG/air circular flame jet impinging upwards normally to a flat rectangular plate. Temperatures of the impingement plate were controlled by cooling water at 38 °C, 58 °C and 78 °C which was circulating at its back {{in order to create}} different plate temperatures. Under each plate temperature, the effects of Reynolds number (Re), equivalence ratio (Ф) and nozzle-to-plate distance (H) on the heat transfer and CO/NOX emissions were examined. The Re was selected to be 500, 1000 and 1500 to ensure laminar flame jets. The values of Фwere chosen to cover fuel-lean, stoichiometric and fuel-rich conditions. The H varied from 3 dto 7 d with an interval of 1 d. The flame-side temperature of the impingement plate is enhanced when the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> increases, but the temperature difference across the impingement plate is reduced.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{steam power}} plant working under the Rankine Cycle and the steam condenser as a heat sink and the steam boiler as a heat source have the same importance for the power plant operating process. Energy efficiency of the coal fired power plant strongly depends on its turbine-condenser system operation mode. For the given thermal power plant configuration, <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> or/and flow rate change generate alterations in the condenser pressure. Those changes have great influence on the energy efficiency of the plant. This paper focuses {{on the influence of}} the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> and flow rate on the condenser performance, and thus on the specific heat rate of the coal fired plant and its energy efficiency. Reference plant is working under turbine-follow mode with an open cycle cooling system. Analysis is done using thermodynamic theory, in order to define heat load dependence on the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> and flow rate. Having these correlations, for given <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> it is possible to determine optimal flow rate of the cooling water in order to achieve an optimal condensing pressure, and thus, optimal energy efficiency of the plant.
