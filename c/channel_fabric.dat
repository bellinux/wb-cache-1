Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) is a transport protocol that predominantly transports SCSI commands over Fibre Channel networks.

40|$|Abstract-The server {{virtualization}} architecture encompassing {{sharing of}} storage subsystems among virtual machines using fibre <b>channel</b> <b>fabrics,</b> to improve server utilization {{and reduce the}} total cost of ownership, was pioneered by IBM through their System z 9 mainframe and its predecessors. With the advent of sharing small computer system interface storage subsystems among host servers through fibre channel based storage area networks, has cropped up new set of security and associated performance issues when the host servers are virtual machines on a single physical server. To address the security issues and reduce {{the total cost of}} ownership, IBM introduced new storage virtualization architecture known as node port identifier virtualization enabling thousands of virtual machines on a server to share storage subsystems through a few numbers of host bus adapters. In this paper, we introduce the node port identifier virtualization architecture and the associated fibre channel switch latency performance issue that would affect virtual machine instantiation when supporting thousands of virtual machines. We first show the architectural problem in hard zoning mechanism contributing to the large fibre channel switch latency by actual performance measurements on a switch using hardware simulators. Next, we suggest a modification to the hard zoning mechanism to reduce the <b>fabric</b> <b>channel</b> switch latency significantly and demonstrate the reduction using hardware simulators. The performance issue we have identified and addressed will allow a single fibre channel switch to support thousands of virtual machines on a server using only a few numbers of host bus adapters...|$|R

50|$|In storage networking, Fibre Channel zoning is the {{partitioning}} of a Fibre <b>Channel</b> <b>fabric</b> {{into smaller}} subsets to restrict interference, add security, and to simplify management. While a SAN makes available several devices and/or ports {{to a single}} device, each system connected to the SAN should only be allowed access to a controlled subset of these devices/ports.

BIOTEX was an EU FP 6 project that developed wearable textile sensors to collect and analyse sweat in real-time.

The patch uses the inherent capillarity of fabrics to transport sweat through a <b>fabric</b> <b>channel</b> with integrated sensing capability. A super-absorbent ma-terial at the end of the channel is used to draw the fluid through the chan-nel and store waste products. This provides a passive pumping action re-quiring no external power.

In addition physiological measurements including respiration and ECG are measured using piezo-resistive fabric and textile electrodes respectively.

40|$|Fibre channel {{storage area}} {{networks}} (SAN) are widely implemented in production data center environments. Recently the storage industry has moved towards deployment of distributed SANs (DSAN), geographically dispersed across large physical distances. In a DSAN, specialized gateway devices interconnect the individual Fibre <b>Channel</b> (FC) <b>fabrics</b> over IP networks using TCP/IP based protocols (iFCP or FCIP) or over metro to long distance optical networks such as Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) based networks that utilize native FC ports supporting {{large numbers of}} link credits. When using TCP/IP based storage networking protocols to interconnect local FC fabrics in a DSAN, the sustained throughput achievable depends upon the link characteristics and TCP/IP stack implementation. Sustaining maximum possible storage traffic throughput across the wide area network enables practical DSAN deployments by maintaining the required site to site service level agreements. This study explores the effects of several TCP/IP modifications on sustained traffic throughput for a DSAN interconnected via iFCP gateways across an impaired network. The TCP/IP stack modifications, known as storage friendly, include changes to the window scaling, congestion avoidance, and fast recovery algorithms. The theoretical background and experimental results are presented to explain and illustrate these modifications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{identify}} the penalties incurred in all-optical networks on routing and restoration operations. We show that these penalties {{can be avoided}} if we replace the transparent switches with opaque switches interfaced by transponders. Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexed (DWDM) mesh networks that route optical connections using wavelength selective optical cross-connects (OXCs) have been proposed to implement next generation networks. In a DWDM network, optical paths on specific wavelengths are set up through the action of OXCs. All Optical Switches (AOS) are OXCs that perform elementary functions such as wavelength routing and switching with all operations executed in the optical domain, thereby providing end-to-end transparent “clear ” channels (optical connections). Because {{of the absence of}} wavelength conversion the constraint of wavelength continuity applies to all optical connections: a signal must remain on the same wavelength from source to destination. The restriction imposed by wavelength continuity can be avoided in an opaque network built as point-to-point DWDM systems with transponders and switches connecting the DWDM <b>channels.</b> The switch <b>fabric</b> in this scenario can be either optical or electrical. In a switch with Optical/Electronic interface (OE switch) the incoming optical signal is converted to an electronic signal, routed and converted back to the optical domain, possibly on a different wavelength. Following a wave of timely technological breakthroughs, optical network vendors are now announcing a variety of all optical gears capable of redirecting light without electronic intervention. However, there is much ambiguity about th...|$|R
