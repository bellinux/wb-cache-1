50|$|An {{overhead}} crane, {{also known}} as a bridge crane, is a type of crane where the hook-and-line mechanism runs along a horizontal beam that itself runs along two widely separated rails. Often it is in a long factory building and runs along rails along the building's two long walls. It is similar to a gantry crane. Overhead cranes typically consist of either a single beam or a double beam construction. These can be built using typical steel beams or a more complex box girder type. Pictured on the right is a single bridge box girder crane with the hoist and system operated with a <b>control</b> <b>pendant.</b> Double girder bridge are more typical when needing heavier capacity systems from 10 tons and above. The advantage of the box girder type configuration results in a system that has a lower deadweight yet a stronger overall system integrity. Also included would be a hoist to lift the items, the bridge, which spans the area covered by the crane, and a trolley to move along the bridge.|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{commissioned}} for Saimaa University of Applied Sciences {{with the aim}} of understanding the control system for a robotic arm. The Robotic Arm in this case was from Saimaa University of Applied Sciences. The main objective of this thesis was to understand a control system for the Robotic Arm using a programmable logic controller (PLC) along with gripper. The control system consisted of the electronic components (the PLC, a motor controller, a voltage regulator, a control pendent and a bride board circuit). The Robotic Arm works manually using potentiometers and also with the help of PLC. At the beginning, studies were carried out to define the design constraints for finding the best options among components that are most suitable for this application. A control system with a PLC needs additional electronic components, such as a DC motor controller and <b>control</b> <b>pendant.</b> The parts selected are those that met the specifications requirements. The majority of the time is spent on understanding wiring and installation. During the installation, consideration is made for a safe and effective process.

40|$|Dimensional {{measurement}} of the subassemblies {{at the beginning of}} the assembly line is a very crucial process for the eyeglasses industry, since even small manufacturing errors of the components can lead to very visible defects on the final product. For this reason, all subcomponents of the eyeglass are verified before beginning the assembly process either with a 100 % inspection or on a statistical basis. Inspection is usually performed by human operators, with high costs and a degree of repeatability which is not always satisfactory. This paper presents a novel on-line measuring system for dimensional verification of small metallic subassemblies for the eyeglasses industry. The machine vision system proposed, which was designed to be used {{at the beginning of the}} assembly line, could also be employed in the Statistical Process Control (SPC) by the manufacturer of the subassemblies. The automated system proposed is based on artificial vision, and exploits two CCD cameras and an anthropomorphic robot to inspect and manipulate the subcomponents of the eyeglass. Each component is recognized by the first camera in a quite large workspace, picked up by the robot and placed in the small vision field of the second camera which performs the measurement process. Finally, the part is palletized by the robot. The system can be easily taught by the operator by simply placing the template object in the vision field of the measurement camera (for dimensional data acquisition) and hence by instructing the robot via the Teaching <b>Control</b> <b>Pendant</b> within the vision field of the first camera (for pick-up transformation acquisition). The major problem we dealt with is that the shape and dimensions of the subassemblies can vary in a quite wide range, but different positioning of the same component can look very similar one to another. For this reason, a specific shape recognition procedure was developed. In the paper, the whole system is presented together with first experimental lab results...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} dinuclear Pd(II) and Pt(II) with central {{rectangular}} cavities have been self-assembled using pyridyl carboxylates as spacers and phosphines [1, 1 ′-bis(diphenylphosphino) ferrocene (dppf) and triphenylphosphines] as supporting ligands. Some of these function as metallacrowns by capturing adventitious alkali or alkali earth metals ions. Two of the Pt(II) rings bind selectively to Na+ whereas the Pd(II) rings prefer Ca 2 +. Such endocyclic {{association with the}} metal ion is facilitated by the converging carbonyl pendants and supported by coordinated triflates. Affinity and selectivity are achieved through stereo-conformational <b>control</b> of the <b>pendant</b> carbonyls and the ring which are isomerically dependent on the spacer. These intermetallic complexes are characterized by X-ray single-crystal crystallography and solution spectroscopy (NMR and ESI-MS).

40|$|Here {{we report}} on the design and {{synthesis}} of cationic water-soluble thiophene copolymers as reporters for colorimetric detection of microRNA (miRNA) in human plasma. Poly(3 -alkoxythiophene) (PT) polyelectrolytes with <b>controlled</b> ratios of <b>pendant</b> groups such as triethylamine/ 1 -methyl imidazole were synthesized for optimizing interaction with target miRNA sequence (Tseq). Incorporation of specific peptide nucleic acid (PNA) sequences with the cationic polythiophenes yielded distinguishable responses upon formation of fluorescent PT-PNA-Tseq triplex and weakly fluorescent PT-Tseq duplex, thereby enabling selective detection of target miRNA. Unlike homopolymers of PT (hPT), experimental results indicate the possibility of utilizing copolymers of PT (cPT) with appropriate ratios of pendant groups for miRNA assay in complex matrices such as plasma. As an illustration, colorimetric responses were obtained for lung cancer associated miRNA sequence (mir 21) in human plasma, with a detection limit of 10 nM, illustrating the feasibility of proposed methodology for clinical applications without involving sophisticated instrumentation. The described methodology therefore possesses high potential for low-cost nucleic acid assays in resource-limited settings...|$|R
40|$|ARIES {{consists}} of a 6 -wheeled K 3 A mobile platform, a compact subturret, a sonar imaging system, a laser-based {{light detection and ranging}} (lidar) navigation beacon system, and a camera positioning system. It has a sonar imaging system used in navigation and collision avoidance and an automatic docking/charging system. Drum-referencing algorithms and camera-positioning algorithms have been included in the primitive instruction set for the robot. The robot`s navigation is based on Synchro-Drive, a patented design that utilizes concentric shafts to distribute drive and steering power to the six wheels simultaneously. ARIES uses a virtual path concept in which only a limited amount of information needs to be provided to the control computer {{in order to get the}} vehicle moving. The safety and health evaluation, during the human factors assessment, found several areas of concern including ergonomics, laser hazards, tripping hazards, fall-from-above and struck-by hazards, electrical hazards, and decontamination of the system. BOA is a self-propelled automated mini-enclosure, able to remove insulation from installed pipes, primarily of 4 inch nominal outside diameter. The system is designed for two operators: one oversees the abatement head operation from a distance of 10 or 15 feet using a <b>pendant</b> <b>control</b> and the other bags the debris at a cyclonic bagging station that is attached by a vacuum hose to the cutting head. Since the abatement head is its own enclosure, there may be no need for further enclosures to be built. The system wets and removes asbestos insulation automatically, cutting the debris into consistent chunks and moving the wave under a strong vacuum to a bagging machine. Prior to reaching the bagging operation, the material passes through a water separator which greatly reduces the weight of the debris and allows recirculation of water, after sufficient filtration. The safety and health evaluation, during the human factors assessment, focused on: noise, dust concentrations, ergonomics, and computer software. Industrial hygiene sampling indicated that worker exposures may be kept low enough during normal operation of BOA to eliminate the need for respiratory or heating protection while working around the cutting head and bagging operation. Airborne particulate measurements showed a slight rise over background levels during the operation of BOA, but the average of all the readings during operation was 1. 6 % of the OSHA respirable dust standard. Air sampling and noise monitoring showed dust to be negligible. Noise was shown to be a potential exposure hazard depending on worker location...|$|R
40|$|Currently pi-conjugated {{polymers}} {{are considered}} as technologically interesting materials {{to be used}} as functional building elements {{for the development of the}} new generation of optoelectronic devices. More specifically during the last few years, poly-p-phenylene materials have attracted considerable attention for their blue photoluminescence properties. This Thesis deals with the optical properties of the most representative blue light poly-p-phenylene emitters such as poly(fluorene), oligo(fluorene), poly(indenofluorene) and ladder-type penta(phenylene) derivatives. In the present work, laser induced photoluminescence spectroscopy is used as a major tool for the study of the interdependence between the dynamics of the probed photoluminescence, the molecular structures of the prepared polymeric films and the presence of chemical defects. Complementary results obtained by two-dimensional wide-angle X-ray diffraction are reported. These findings show that the different optical properties observed are influenced by the intermolecular solid-state interactions that in turn are <b>controlled</b> by the <b>pendant</b> groups of the polymer backbone. A significant feedback is delivered regarding the positive impact of a new synthetic route for the preparation of a poly(indenofluorene) derivative on the spectral purity of the compound. The energy transfer mechanisms that operate in the studied systems are addressed by doping experiments. After the evaluation of the structure/property interdependence, a new optical excitation pathway is presented. An efficient photon low-energy up-conversion that sensitises the blue emission of poly(fluorene) is demonstrated. The observed phenomenon takes place in poly(fluorene) derivatives hosts doped with metallated octaethyl porphyrins, after quasi-CW photoexcitation of intensities in the order of kW/cm 2. The up-conversion process is parameterised in terms of temperature, wavelength excitation and central metal cation in the porphyrin ring. Additionally the observation of the up-conversion is extended in a broad range of poly-p-phenylene blue light emitting hosts. The dependence of the detected up-conversion intensity on the excitation intensity and doping concentration is reported. Furthermore the dynamics of the up-conversion intensity are monitored as a function of the doping concentration. These experimental results strongly suggest the existence of triplet-triplet annihilation events into the porphyrin molecules that are subsequently followed by energy transfer to the host. After confirming the occurrence of the up-conversion in solutions, cyclic voltammetry is used in order to show that the up-conversion efficiency is partially determined from the energetic alignment between the HOMO levels of the host and the dopant...|$|R
40|$|The article studies {{dynamics}} of rotor on active magnetic bearings within the mathematical model development of rotor in artificial ventricle. The problem of stabilization of rigid titanium rotor with magnetic inserts on active magnetic bearings is analyzed. The {{relevance of the}} research field is caused by high {{percent of people who}} are suffering from heart disease. The purposes of work are to create a mathematical model of the rigid rotor and position its center to meet specified requirements for displacement of no more than 0. 2 millimeter while rotating with the speed from 5 000 rpm to 10 000 rpm in constant blood flow. The work of AMBs is based on the principle of active magnetic pendant of ferromagnetic solid. The stabilization in adjusted position is accomplished by magnetic forces, which affect the solid from the control electromagnets. The article presents initial data, design scheme, assumptions accepted to solve the problem and derivation of dynamic equation of rotating rigid rotor on AMBs. The decentralized <b>control</b> of magnetic <b>pendant</b> was implemented. The PD control – proportional differential control - was chosen as the base of control system. Its application is widespread due to the simplicity, industrial use and operation stability. The use of decentralized control in dynamics modeling of a rigid rotor in AMBs is physically occurred and has some advantages. One of the most important advantages is the calculation of control parameters by selection of appropriate values of rigidity and damping parameters. The analysis of rotor dynamics was conducted in MATLAB© software package. The modeling was performed to allow observing the system action while the parameters were varied. The conducted research showed that to meet the specified requirements of maximal rotor displacement no more than 0. 2 mm the following values of coefficients were required:                                         and  The stabilization of the rotor axis position is provided in 10 and 0. 5 seconds, respectively, for oscillation from to m with specified values of gains. From the gains obtained, parameters of magnetic bearings can be estimated and desirable ones can be {{selected on the basis of}} specified constructional and technical requirements for rotor operation. The conducted work supposes further research of the rotor position issue to improve the offered development. </p...|$|R
