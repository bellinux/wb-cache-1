40|$|The {{field of}} {{competition}} (antitrust) policy embodies {{many of the}} dilemmas {{that are at the}} heart of current debates on international cooperation and inter-jurisdictional competition in economic regulation generally. These dilemmas are illustrated in vivid fashion in the Transatlantic context, in which we see both: (i) the existence and regular use of formal <b>cooperation</b> <b>arrangements</b> for the enforcement of competition law that have been in place for a number of years; and (ii) periodic conflicts that nonetheless arise in the enforcement stances taken by the US and the EC in major transnational antitrust cases, which arguably call for deeper forms of co-operation and coordination. At the same time, calls for substantive harmonization of competition law and enforcement approaches have been widely rejected, in part on the ground that this would deprive citizens of the benefits of inter-jurisdictional competition in the antitrust sphere. The case for a deepening of current <b>cooperation</b> <b>arrangements</b> is considered in this light.

40|$|The {{agriculture}} of the Central-Eastern European {{countries were}} considerably transformed during the 1990 s. The property structure became fragmented, arable land {{and means of}} farming were privatized by different methods in different countries and - {{as a consequence of}} this - the hegemony of large-scale farming was wound up but to different degrees. Most of the newly formed small farms had no appropriate equipment and power machines for performing competitive production. The integration of these countries into the European Union has brought significant changes which further strengthened the need for competitiveness. Producers in the agriculture of Western European countries represent major market power due to the cooperation models (cooperative movements, machine and farm ring movement, producer organisations, etc.), but requirements of productivity, efficiency and profitability are also highlighted within these <b>cooperation</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The paper focuses on <b>cooperation</b> <b>arrangements</b> for joint machinery use and examines the factors affecting their expansion. The starting point of examinations is a former situation analysis made about the equipment supply of agricultural plans of a Romanian settlement and the cooperation willingness of producers.

The specific research goal is to comparatively investigate inter-organizational cooperation and its humanitarian operation performance during the emergency response of the West Java Earthquake 2009 and the West Sumatra Earthquake 2009. Accordingly, the research objectives include the following: (1) examine the practices of inter-organizational cooperation during the emergency response of both earthquakes; (2) model the networks of inter-organizational cooperation during the emergency response of both earthquakes and explore their characteristics, i.e., by using social network analysis (SNA) performed using UCINET version 6.532 (Borgatti et al. 2002) and categorized based on Gillmann’s typology (Gillmann 2010); (3) identify and compare performance of humanitarian aid operations resulting from the given network of actors and its cooperation, i.e., by using some criteria conceptualized by Beck (2006); and (4) identify policy implications and their practical relevance to the humanitarian field, e.g., in the context of Indonesia, Southeast Asia, and international humanitarian system in general.|$|R

50|$|A {{third way}} of {{distinguishing}} cross-border regions considers {{the nature of}} the participating authorities. Most of the small-scale initiatives involve local authorities as the driving protagonists whereas large-scale CBC is almost exclusively driven by regional authorities. There is variance in this respect, depending on the territorial organization of different European countries. For instance, in Germany, local administration comprises two levels, the municipalities and the Kreise, with the latter being self-governed groupings of municipalities. In most cases, the Kreise are the driving force behind cross-border initiatives. By contrast, in Italy, it is meso-level authorities, the 'province' (provinces), that are usually involved in cross-border cooperation initiatives while the municipalities play a minor role because of their relative fragmentation compared to the German Kreise. In Scandinavia, as for instance in the Øresund region, both counties and large urban municipalities (Greater Copenhagen) participate in the <b>cooperation</b> <b>arrangement.</b> In general, in countries with a strong role for inter-municipal associations, cross-border co-operation is often pursued by local actors. By contrast, in countries with a two-tier regional administration and a minor role for inter-local action (such as Italy or France), cross-border regions are a domain pursued by regional authorities.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 72 - 76). Water shortage and {{the deterioration}} of water quality in the Middle Eastern region are alarming. The question of water shortage is becoming a salient issue and a prominent potential source of conflict. This thesis examines the various researches from various fields of study that have simulated forthcoming Middle Eastern water war, amid dramatic increase in water demands beyond national capacities. It examines the existing state of war between Lebanon and Israel and illustrates that unless a water <b>cooperation</b> <b>arrangement</b> is soon reached alternatives may yield grave consequences. This necessitates technical as well as ideological reorientations in national ideological discourses that shift attitudes and policies from a national to a regional development-based paradigm. The thesis demonstrates various models and possibilities for cooperation over water managements between Israel and Lebanon that can divert possible conflict and renewed war. An action plan with a water management road map is proposed to be implemented as to place the use of water resources efficiently and productively. The model can serve for multilateral cooperation to resolve the problem of water shortage in the Middle East. 1 bound copy: x, 76 leaves; 31 cm. available at RNL...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{argues in}} favour of university-industry {{cooperation}} and has underlined the role of innovation policy to foster its dynamics. In Germany, for instance, the policy launched impetuses to increase the feasibility of such cooperation in the 1980 s and 1990 s. Within universities transfer sub-organizations have been installed to fulfil the task of bringing university and industry closer. Meier and Krücken (2011) consider this recent development critically and even question this institutional innovation. According to their empirical results, these institutions within universities cannot fulfil the desired outcome. In fact such transfer organizations fail especially if implicit know-how {{is necessary for the}} cooperation. They do not dispose of the knowledge for each <b>cooperation</b> <b>arrangement</b> and are therefore often disregarded by the industry as well as by university researchers. Instead, personal contacts between the different stakeholders remain crucial for generating momentum in cooperation, or to put it in another way, institutional reorganizations are no substitute for the necessary trust-building measures. This example is therefore quoted within this context, since these transfer sub organizations were realized in Germany due to political constraints. The universities have not internalized this policy wish and have instead proceeded to conduct business as usual (Meier and Krücken 2011).|$|R

40|$|Indonesia’s {{cooperation}} in maritime security initiatives {{is vitally important}} because half of the world’s trading goods and oil pass through Indonesian waters including the Straits of Malacca, the Strait of Sunda and the Strait of Lombok. Consequently, Indonesia’s active engagement in maritime cooperation {{is a matter of}} some import for the international community. However, Indonesia’s varying participation across maritime <b>cooperation</b> <b>arrangements</b> is puzzling. Indonesia has joined some of these {{cooperation in}}itiatives and opted out of others despite the presence of United States leadership. This thesis addresses this puzzle by carrying out a comparative analysis of 26 <b>cooperation</b> <b>arrangements</b> using government documents and elite interviews in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and New York. In addition to addressing an empirical puzzle, this thesis also contributes to the theoretical debate on international cooperation. The International Relations literature on cooperation tends to focus on great power bargaining. Whether, why and how middle powers decide to join international initiatives over which they have little influence has been overlooked. The implication of this study suggests that neither the calculation of relative gains as argued by neorealists, the constructivist expectation regarding the importance of shared identity, the neorealist or the neoliberal argument on the role of hegemonic leadership nor the bureaucratic politics approach emphasis on competing government actors’ preferences can explain the variation in Indonesia’s engagement with cooperation initiatives. I argue that Indonesia’s decision to cooperate is formed by the calculation of absolute gains. Indonesia cooperated as long as the benefits of cooperation exceeded the costs...|$|E
