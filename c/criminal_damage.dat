5|$|The modern law of <b>criminal</b> <b>damage</b> {{is mostly}} {{contained}} in the <b>Criminal</b> <b>Damage</b> Act 1971, which redefines or creates several offences protecting property rights.

5|$|These {{provisions}} {{are similar to}} those set out in section 5 of the Theft Act 1968 in relation to theft. It is clearly a right of property ownership to deal with property as one wishes, including its damage or destruction. However a person setting fire to his own house which is subject to a mortgage can be charged because the mortgagee will have a proprietary right or interest in the property. Property that is abandoned has no owner, and cannot be stolen; it follows that such property cannot be the subject of a charge of <b>criminal</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E

5|$|Previously {{the police}} used a {{decentralized}} {{information technology system}} developed during the mid-1990s. As late as 2012 servers were still being run with Windows NT 4.0 from 1996 and log-on times were typically twenty minutes.

5|$|The {{jury found}} Bell guilty, and {{he faced the}} {{possibility}} of up to 22years in prison. The judge scheduled sentencing for September 20, 2007. Bell's new defense attorneys, Bob Noel, Walter Lee Perkins Jr., Peggy Sullivan, Louis Scott and Carol Powell-Lexing, requested a new trial {{on the grounds that}} Bell should not have been tried as an adult. A request to lower Bell's $90,000bond was denied on August 24, 2007, due to his juvenile record. Bell had been put on probation for a battery that occurred December 25, 2005. While on probation, he was convicted of another battery charge and two charges of <b>criminal</b> <b>damage</b> to property. One of the battery charges was reportedly for punching a 17-year-old girl in the face. The media had initially reported that Bell had no prior criminal record. On September 4, 2007, Judge Mauffray vacated the conspiracy conviction on the grounds that Bell should have been tried as a juvenile, but he let the battery conviction stand. Bell appealed his conviction, principally on the ground that he had been improperly tried as an adult. On September 14, 2007, Louisiana's Third Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Bell's battery conviction, agreeing that this remaining charge was not among those for which a juvenile may be tried as an adult.|$|E

40|$|While {{countries}} {{have been more than}} willing to regulate insider trading it is an open question as to whether this has resulted in improvements for those markets. In particular lawmakers have had to largely structure the legal regimes with little guidance as to what makes an effective insider trading law. We seek to address this by examining the aspects of a legal regime that result in reductions in information trading and trading costs. Employing a sample of 18 countries we compare specific and quantifiable aspects of the legal regime with the measures of transactions costs in a sample of up to 70 randomly selected companies per market. We find that stronger laws result in reductions in the cost of informed trading. Particularly we find that broader laws laws that employ financial rather than <b>criminal</b> <b>damages</b> and laws that are enforced by strong public regulators perform best. These results should help to enlighten regulator attempts to create strong and effective insider trading law...|$|R
