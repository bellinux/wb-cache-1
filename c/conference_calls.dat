5|$|The {{walkie-talkie}} {{interaction in}} Firewatch {{is inspired by}} the relationship in BioShock between the player character and Atlas, {{as well as the}} dialog system from The Walking Dead. At one point in the development, it was intended that the protagonist would be able to communicate with multiple characters, such as hikers, but the idea was discarded due to its expense and the schedule requirements with which the team were working. The team hoped to avoid lip syncing and minimize the amount of animation needed due to the limited team size and resources. The developers cast Cissy Jones, who appeared in The Walking Dead, as the voice of Delilah in 2014. It took longer to find a voice actor for Henry who the developers felt jibed with Jones; they ultimately cast Rich Sommer. Jones and Sommer recorded their lines in separate studios, but while on <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> with each other to achieve a more natural rapport. The actors made a decision not to meet during production to maintain the distance between their characters.|$|E
