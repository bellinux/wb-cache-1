Successful adaptation to the changing conditions in the borderlands required accommodation, compromise, and alliances as much as it did violent confrontation, martial prowess, and the capacity to wage war.

By 1867, the last of the volunteer soldiers of the Civil War era had mustered out of service, and Benito Juárez’s Republicans had driven out the French, executed Emperor Maximilian, and reclaimed Mexico. In the border states of Chihuahua and Sonora, Mexican Republican troops began relocating tribes and reestablishing settlements devastated by Apache raiders. In the newly-configured U. S. territories of Arizona and New Mexico, slavery as an economic and social system began to collapse, and a new social, political, and economic order arose, with Anglos and Hispanos at the top of the hierarchy and the raiding tribes at the bottom. The federal government exerted control over reservation-restricted Indians and defined new territorial boundaries. International relations had also changed. A more defined and restricted border between Mexico and the United States emerged from the war-torn borderlands while Hispano and Anglo citizens uneasily shared a new American political and economic model for survival in the Southwest...|$|E

40|$|The Julia {{programming}} language is gaining enormous popularity. Julia {{was designed to}} be easy and fast. Most importantly, Julia shatters deeply established notions widely held in the applied community: 1. High-level, dynamic code has to be slow by some sort of law of nature 2. It is sensible to prototype in one language and then recode in another language 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts. Julia began with a deep understanding of the needs of the scientific programmer and the needs of the computer in mind. Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from computer science and computational science creating a new approach to scientific computing. This note introduces the programmer to the language and the underlying design theory. It invites the reader to rethink the fundamental foundations of numerical computing systems. In particular, there is the fascinating dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for <b>custom</b> <b>treatment.</b> We can pick just the right algorithm for the right circumstance and this can happen at runtime based on argument types (code selection via multiple dispatch). Abstraction recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away and ignored as irrelevant. The recognition of abstraction allows for code reuse (generic programming). A simple idea that yields incredible power. The Julia design facilitates this interplay in many explicit and subtle ways for machine perfor-mance and, most importantly, human convenience. 1 a...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Measurement of {{the number}} of {{circulating}} tumor cells (CTCs) in the bloodstream has been shown to have prognostic significance in treating breast carcinoma. This pilot study was formulated to determine if stage IV non-small cell lung carcinomas similarly shed malignant cells into the circulation and if their presence has prognostic significance. Methods: Patients with stage IV non-small cell lung carcinomas were tested once for CTCs in 7. 5 ml of their blood prior to receiving any treatments. A proprietary blood collection kit produced by Veridex LLC (Raritan, NJ), which manufactures the instrument that performs the immunomagnetic CELLSEARCH® CTC assay, was used. Tumor measurements were determined in three dimensions by the same radiologist using computerized axial tomography. The three-dimensional sum was used to represent tumor size. Survival from the date of the pretreatment CTC assay was monitored and recorded. Data were analyzed statistically using NCSS 8 statistical software (NCSS LLC, Kaysville, UT). Results: Of 19 evaluable patients, 10 had no detectable CTCs. There was no relation between intrapulmonary primary tumor size and the number of CTCs, nor between tumor size and survival. Survival was not affected by gender or age at entry into the trial. The mean survival of those with no detectable CTCs was 536 ± 91. 1 days versus 239 ± 96. 0 days for those with 1 or more detectable CTCs, a statistically significant advantage (P= 0. 034) favoring those without CTCs. Conclusions: Patients with a CTC score of 0 survived significantly longer than those with a CTC score of ≥ 1. Survival was not correlated with gender, age or primary tumor size. Recovery of CTCs potentially provides a noninvasive source of tumor cells for genomic profiling, which may enable development of a <b>custom</b> <b>treatment</b> plan for the individual patient.

40|$|The {{expectation}} for continual {{improvements in}} the treatment of cancer has brought quality assurance in radiotherapy under scrutiny in recent years. After a cancer diagnosis a <b>custom</b> <b>treatment</b> plan is devised to meet the particular needs of the patient’s condition based on their prognosis. A cancer treatment plan will typically comprise of several cancer treatment technologies combining to form a comprehensive programme to fight the malignant growth. Inherent in each cancer treatment technology is a percentage error in treatment accuracy. Quality assurance is the medical practice to minimise the percentage error in treatment accuracy. Radiotherapy is one of the several cancer treatment technologies a patient might receive as part of their treatment plan, and in-vivo dosimetry is a quality assurance technology specifically designed to minimise the percentage error in the treatment accuracy of radiotherapy. This thesis outlines the work completed in the design of a next generation dosimeter for in-vivo dosimetry. The proposed dosimeter is intended to modernise the process of measuring the absorbed dose of ionising radiation received by the target volume during a radiotherapy session. To accomplish this goal the new dosimeter will amalgamate specialist technologies from the field of particle physics and reapply them to the field of medical physics.
