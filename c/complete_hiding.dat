These algorithms utilize three new weights {{to reduce the}} needed database modifications and support <b>complete</b> <b>hiding,</b> {{as well as they}} reduce the knowledge distortion and the data distortions. Complete weighted hiding algorithms enhance the hiding failure by 100 %; these algorithms have the advantage of performing only a single scan for the database to gather the required information to form the hiding process. These proposed algorithms are built within the database structure which enables the sanitized database to be generated on run time as needed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] The visual {{inspection}} {{is an important}} factor in examining encrypted images, where the highly disappeared features of the image, the better the encryption algorithm used. However, depending on the {{visual inspection}} only is not enough in judging the quality of <b>complete</b> <b>hiding</b> of the content of the data image. In this paper, we estimate the degree of image encryption quality not only practically using visual inspection, but also quantitatively using quality evaluation metrics. The efficient robust chaotic block cipher (RCBC) encryption quality algorithm for digital imaging is investigated. Comparative analysis regarding encryption quality (EQ) of the RCBC with algorithms such as RC 6, and RC 5 is performed. Ciphers design parameters are analyzed for their optimal values, as function of different ciphers operation modes, including ECB, CBC, CFB, and OFB. Thorough experimental tests are carried out with detailed analysis demonstrating the better performance of the RCBC block cipher. Index Terms — Symmetric block ciphers, images encryption quality, and encryption algorithms analysis. I...|$|E
