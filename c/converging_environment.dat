40|$|Abstract—Today, {{there is}} an {{abundance}} of information and ser-vices in heterogeneous contexts, such as <b>converged</b> <b>environments</b> (Next Generation Networks) available for end users. However, the developments of Telecommunications and Internet converged services represent {{a high level of}} complexity for users without technical skills, since user’s requests are represented by complex expressions that describe the required services. Thus, the search and selection of these services depend on the ability of the user to retrieve the most suitable ones, converting this labor in an inefficient task. With this in mind, and in order to improve the time to create convergent services, this paper proposes a novel approach that supports the automatic retrieval of services in <b>converged</b> <b>environments,</b> considering functional and non-functional properties of end-user’s requests in natural language. Finally, we present the prototype that implements our proposed architecture and particularly, we describe in detail the defined tasks for natural language processing (NLP).

40|$|In December 1997, the European Commission {{published}} a Green Paper on the regulatory {{implications of the}} convergence of telecommunications, media and information technology sectors. The article starts {{with a look at}} the consultation process, and goes on to discuss some of the substantive issues raised. Without repeating material already evident in the Green Paper itself, it attempts to clarify the difference between Community and national approaches to regulation. Some ideas on the basis for national regulation are then explored, as are notions of the balance between the application of competition rules and sector-specific regulation in a <b>converged</b> <b>environment.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|NoThe {{boundaries}} between {{different kinds of}} media spaces are complex and challenging. The convergence of computing, media, and telecommunications produces environments that contain elements of their origins, but also contain new components that allow interaction in new ways by new users with new kinds of information. This poses problems for effective human computer interaction and human media interaction because the paradigms are not well understood. <b>Converged</b> <b>environments</b> are driving these new uses just as the first PCs supported keyboards and then WIMP interfaces.

The user-centric vision next-generation 4 G is neighborhood Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). The {{vision for the}} formation of WMNs reflects the trade-off between the immediate self-interest of the user, and user's need for social contacts. The use of WMNs provide attractive means in reducing costs, as well as offering added value services and free Internet access. It can also provide additional network capacity, enable the sharing of other resources, and offering services to mobile users applications. The deployment of WMN can be seen as an intermediate step towards more general ad-hoc, user-centric environments...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRelying on an IMS/Web 2. 0 <b>converged</b> <b>environment,</b> {{this paper}} proposes an {{extensible}} service composition model which uses {{the concept of}} policy for encapsulating the service composition information. Then based on this model, the policy concept is enhanced by being divided into two types (abstract service policy and concrete service policy) for realizing the automatic service composition which mainly relates to the service update and service creation processes. Moreover, an active approach, a passive approach, and a hybrid approach are proposed for balancing the latency and real-time characteristic. With these enhancements, both user's experience and involvement are greatly improved, the service lifecycle is optimized, and the costs for service creation and maintenance are decrease...|$|R

40|$|Media {{policy in}} the United States has, since its inception, been governed by the {{principle}} that infrastructure providers should serve "the public interest. " The Federal Communications Commission has traditionally been charged with enforcing various obligations on businesses under this principle. Policymakers have developed different regimes for different media, but these distinctions no longer make sense in a technologically <b>converged</b> <b>environment.</b> This study draws upon the historical origins of the principle in order to inform contemporary debates in communication policy. It recovers some of the normative meaning behind "the public interest" phrase, and identifies the several dimensions in which it remains relevant today.

40|$|Library {{services}} for {{blind and visually}} impaired people (VIPs) have been inextricably tied up with alternative format production, which has never risen above 4 percent of standard-text publishing. The impact of digital publishing has been modest on Braille, modified print and audio; this partly results from production methods but also from defensive copyright in which the rights of authors outweigh consumer access rights. In this instance librarians should: assert customer rights against author rights; require piracy evidence; work towards a global digital accessibility library; and advocate a generic right to information. In a global digitally <b>converged</b> <b>environment</b> VIPs will need help with navigation, data evaluation and file migration; these needs will alter the traditional, neutral, role of librarians, transforming them into facilitators, covering what were traditionally described as broadcasting and telecommunications.

40|$|This {{special issue}} of Networking Science focuses on Next Generation Network (NGN) that enables the {{deployment}} of access independent services over converged fixed and mobile networks. NGN is a packet-based network and uses the Internet protocol (IP) to transport {{the various types of}} traffic (voice, video, data and signalling). NGN facilitates easy adoption of distributed computing applications by providing high speed connectivity in a <b>converged</b> networked <b>environment.</b> It also makes end user devices and applications highly intelligent and efficient by empowering them with programmability and remote configuration options. However, {{there are a number of}} important challenges in provisioning next generation network technologies in a <b>converged</b> communication <b>environment.</b> Some preliminary challenges include those that relate to QoS, switching and routing, management and control, and security which must be addressed on an urgent or emergency basis.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, the {{internet}} and e-commerce have reshaped the way we communicate, interact and transact. In the <b>converged</b> <b>environment</b> enabled by high speed broadband, web 2. 0, social media, virtual worlds, user-generated content, cloud computing, VoIP, open source software and open content have rapidly become established features of our online experience. Business and government alike are increasingly using the internet as the preferred platform for delivery of their goods and services and for effective engagement with their clients. New {{ways of doing things}} online and challenges to existing business, government and social activities have tested current laws and often demand new policies and laws, adapted to the new realities. The focus of this book is the regulation of social, cultural and commercial activity on the World Wide Web.

40|$|International audienceCommunication {{services}} are evolving at an unprecedented rate. No longer limited to interpersonal vocal communication, they now integrate {{functions such as}} address books, content sharing and messaging. The emergence of social networks - which may also include these features - is {{an important element of}} this transformation. Content {{services are}} becoming flagship services themselves, and are sometimes paired up with conversation services. The boundaries between different services are becoming less and less distinct. This book meets the need for a better understanding of communication services, and for a general framework of their description. A detailed overview on service architecture in the Telco, Web and IT worlds is presented, offering a roadmap with explanations on how to improve the architecture and governance of communication service architectures by exploiting the syntax and semantics that are common to different services is clearly outlined. This book also responds to recurring questions about service design, such as the functional scope of enablers or SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) services, the relevance of service composition to the user and collaboration between different services in a <b>converged</b> <b>environment.</b> Many concrete examples from telecoms service providers' operations illustrate these concepts...|$|R

40|$|Conferences {{addressing}} emerging commonalities in {{the information}} professions were being held {{as far back as}} the early 1980 s. At that time, there appeared to be two differing thoughts on the future of the information professions: one that saw the increasing diversification, the other favouring the professions&# 039; convergence. Nearly thirty-five years later, we are still discussing the various advantages and disadvantages that a convergence of the information professions and professionals may bring; yet there has been very little empirical evidence gathered to enable us to move forward in this discussion. This conceptual paper uses existing literature to argue that the convergence of galleries, libraries, archives and museums is not a new concept to these institutions, but that they have been linked - philosophically and intellectually at least - for millennia. The intention of this paper is not to articulate what should be included in a GLAM curriculum, or to identify the skills and knowledge required of an information professional in a <b>converged</b> <b>environment,</b> but rather to demonstrate that this research is needed in order to provide an evidence base from which these may be developed...|$|R

40|$|Before the US {{crackdown}} on WikiLeaks website from 2010, {{the narrative of}} freedom dominating discourses on uneasy deployment of new {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) in journalism was more prevalent in Africa – and developing regions – than in advanced democracies.

40|$|This {{report has}} been {{prepared}} by the Australian Key Centre for Cultural and Media Policy {{as part of the}} ARC SPIRT research partnership with the Australian Broadcasting Authority. The report explores strategies for the achievement of cultural objectives in broadcasting in <b>converged</b> television <b>environments,</b> assuming the continuation of the cultural and social objectives currently embodied in section 3 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. The report examines regulatory frameworks in place around the world and proposals for new approaches, and considers the potential for their application in the Australian policy environment. While the ecology of <b>converged</b> television <b>environments</b> will vary from country to country, it is widely expected that such environments may be characterised by a series of technological and market changes, including: the transition to digital transmission; more efficient and extensive use of spectrum; a more competitive environment; multichannel programming; and interactive services. These are some of the features of an 'ideal type' of modern broadcasting system. None of these developments are inevitable; we can make few assumptions about when or whether such an environment will exist in Australia. Nevertheless, these assumptions enable us to begin to consider the future options and problems for broadcasters, producers, policymakers and viewers...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a case study of}} the multimedia/converged media {{newsroom}} at Abilene Christian University. The multimedia newsroom designer created a space in which students will be able to apply to student media products the theories and praxes they are discussing in the traditional classroom. Just as many professional news organizations move toward more <b>converged</b> <b>environments,</b> media educators must provide opportunities for students to learn in such environments. Through an exploration of constructivist learning theory and professional industry standards, the designer of the multimedia newsroom at Abilene Christian University gained an understanding of cognitive development and how it relates to learning, as well as professional practices and expectations for graduates. The multimedia newsroom comprises the print, broadcast and online student media products. Each of the products {{is a part of the}} whole [...] each providing its unique advantages to the coverage of a story. Students produce media in an environment that cultivates collaboration between faculty and students and among peers in a technologically advanced facility. The goal of the multimedia newsroom is to provide student learning opportunities in a progressive media environment that is functional, attractive and supports the curriculum. Since its opening in January 2008, the new facility has fostered understanding and respect among the staffs of different student media outlets and created a synergistic learning environment by providing opportunities for students to observe and participate in each other’s processes...|$|R
