A plane containing a coordinate axis is translated so that it no longer contains that axis before its Miller indices are determined. The Miller indices for a plane are integers with no common factors. Negative indices are indicated with horizontal bars, as in (13).

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} a novel ESPRIT-based closedform source localization algorithm applicable to arbitrarily spaced three-dimensional arrays of vector hydrophones, whose locations {{need not be}} known. Each vector hydrophone consists {{of two or three}} identical but orthogonally oriented velocity hydrophones plus one pressure hydrophone, all spatially co-located in a point-like geometry. A velocity hydrophone measures one <b>Cartesian</b> <b>component</b> of the incident sonar wavefield’s velocity vector, whereas a pressure hydrophone measures the acoustic wavefield’s pressure. Velocity-hydrophone technology is well established in underwater acoustics and a great variety of commercial models have long been available. ESPRIT is realized herein by exploiting the nonspatial interrelations among each vector hydrophone’s constituent hydrophones, such that ESPRIT’s eigenvalues become independent of array geometry. Simulation results verify the efficacy and versatility of this innovative scheme. Aspects of this underwater acoustic algorithm are analogous to Li’s earlier work with diversely polarized antennas.

40|$|An {{acoustic}} vector-sensor (a. k. a. vector-hydrophone) {{is composed}} of three acoustic velocity-sensors, plus a collocated pressure-sensor, all collocated in space. The velocity-sensors are identical, but orthogonally oriented, each measuring a different <b>Cartesian</b> <b>component</b> of the three-dimensional particle-velocity field. This acoustic vector-sensor offers an azimuth-elevation response that is invariant {{with respect to the}} source's center frequency or bandwidth. This acoustic vector-sensor is adopted here for recursive least-squares (RLS) adaptation, to track a single mobile source, {{in the absence of any}} multipath fading and any directional interference. A formula is derived to preset the RLS forgetting factor, based on the prior knowledge of only the incident signal power, the incident source's spatial random walk variance, and the additive noise power. The work presented here further advances a multiple-forgetting-factor (MFF) version of the RLS adaptive tracking algorithm, that requires no prior knowledge of these aforementioned source statistics or noise statistics. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the tracking performance and computational load of the proposed algorithms. Department of Electronic and Information Engineerin...|$|R
