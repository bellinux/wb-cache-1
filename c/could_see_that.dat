5|$|While {{the film}} was still untitled, Javed Akhtar was signed to write the lyrics, and even wrote and {{recorded}} one song. However, when the movie was titled Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, he found the title mediocre, obscene, and vulgar and decided to quit the project. Akhtar later regretted leaving the film, as he found it decent and <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the title has become quite a buzz-word, realizing {{that he was the}} only one who disliked the title.|$|E
5|$|At 07:00 on 4 August, {{while the}} French {{squadron}} was cruising off the Brazilian coast, lookouts sighted sails on the horizon. Uncertain {{of the identity}} of the strange ships, the French gradually closed the distance during the morning. Landolphe <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> there were seven large vessels and three smaller ships, all unmistakably British. He was unable however to tell whether they were naval ships of the line or East Indiamen. Initially he thought they might be merchant ships, but at noon he sighted double rows of gunports along the side of each ship and called off the attack, turning away and signalling for his squadron to split up, believing the enemy to be large warships easily capable of destroying his small force. Captain Jurien protested Landolphe's order, insisting that the convoy was composed of merchant ships and not warships, but Landolphe over-ruled Jurien's protests. In fact, Jurien was correct.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte's {{position}} as First Consul was {{strengthened by the}} successful outcome of the battle and the preceding campaign. After this victory, Napoleon could breathe a sigh of relief. The generals who had been hostile to him <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> his luck had not abandoned him. Thus, he had surpassed Schérer, Joubert, Championnet, and even Moreau, none {{of whom had been}} able to inflict a decisive blow on the Coalition. Moreau's victory at Hohenlinden, which was the one that in reality had {{put an end to the}} war, was minimised by Bonaparte who, from then on, would pose as a saviour of the fatherland, and even of the Republic. He rejected offers from Louis XVIII, who had considered the Consulate to be a mere transition towards the restoration of the king. Thanks to the victory at Marengo, Napoleon could finally set about reforming France according to his own vision.|$|E

5|$|Gittings {{admitted}} that early meetings and writings in the Daughters of Bilitis urged their members not to upset mainstream heterosexual society; that integration and acceptance would be won if heterosexuals <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{gays and lesbians}} were not dramatically different from themselves. She worked in clerical positions during this time, spending ten years as a mimeograph operator for an architectural firm. The New York chapter of the DOB distributed a newsletter to about 150 people, and Gittings worked on it while being required to stay overtime at her job. In 1959, after using company envelopes to mail the newsletter out and covering the firm's name with a sticker, someone wrote to the firm to notify them that a newsletter addressing lesbianism was being distributed. Gittings was sure {{that she would be}} fired, but her boss, a woman, stated cryptically that she was familiar with the topic, having served in the armed forces. She was not fired but cautioned to be more careful instead.|$|E
5|$|The second depot-laying party left Framheim on 22February, {{with eight}} men, seven sledges and forty-two dogs. Conditions on the Barrier had {{deteriorated}} sharply; average temperatures had dropped by 9°C (16°F), and rough snow had drifted across the previously smooth ice surface. In temperatures sometimes {{as low as}} , on 3March the party reached 81°S, where they established a second depot. Amundsen, Helmer Hanssen, Prestrud, Johansen and Wisting then continued with the strongest dogs, hoping to reach 83°S, but in difficult conditions they halted at 82°S on 8March. Amundsen <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the dogs were exhausted; the party turned for home, and with light sledges travelled swiftly to reach Framheim on 22 March. Amundsen wanted more supplies taken south before the impending polar night made travel impossible, and on 31 March a party of seven men led by Johansen left Framheim for the 80°S depot with six slaughtered seals— of meat. The party returned on 11 April—three days later than expected—after they strayed into a field of crevasses.|$|E

25|$|Eickemeyer <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{although}} there were approximately 20,000 troops, they only had field artillery, not siege equipment, and a city the size of Mainz, even as poorly fortified as it was, would require specialty equipment.Custine sent word for a capitulation and the city fathers had a meeting on their situation. The French troops, now called Army of the Vosges by decision of the Convention, began the encirclement and siege of the city on October 18. On that night, the vanguard of General Jean Nicolas Houchard reached Weisenau.|$|E
25|$|When he went {{north to}} {{suppress}} the Phra Fang faction, he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> monks in the north were lax and undisciplined.

Even though King Taksin had applied himself to reforming the Buddhist religion after its period of decline following the loss of Ayutthaya to Burma, gradually bringing it back to the normalcy it enjoyed during the Ayutthaya kingdom, since his reign was so brief {{he was not able to}} do very much.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of Ghanaian women deliver {{at home with}} a traditional birth attendant and are referred to the hospital in cases of complicated labor. Although most deliveries are attended by a traditional birth attendant, most women prefer to deliver with a health professional. Barriers to obtaining professional health care include high costs, inadequate transportation, long distances to health care facilities, and poor road conditions. Some women were also too embarrassed to go to a hospital because they did not have nice clothes and preferred to deliver at home where no one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> they were poor.|$|E
25|$|There is {{controversy}} {{about whether there}} was sufficient time for more effective emergency evacuation. The main problem was {{that most of the}} personnel who had the authority to order evacuation had been killed when the first explosion destroyed the control room. This was a consequence of the platform design, which did not include blast walls. Another contributing factor was that the nearby connected platforms Tartan and Claymore continued to pump gas and oil to Piper Alpha until its pipeline ruptured in the heat in the second explosion. Their operations crews did not believe they had authority to shut off production, even though they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Piper Alpha was burning.|$|E
25|$|Ben {{had never}} shown {{interest}} in “boy” toys, {{they wanted to}} wear girl’s clothing and grow long hair. Soon they started to make their gender clear: they talked about being a girl and their identity not matching anatomy. Finally, Ben told family they would go by Kate. In the beginning, the child lived a double life. In school, she was “Ben”; at home, she was Kate. Characteristics between the two identities drastically varied. Ben was quiet, shy and withdrawn, while Kate was extroverted and happy. Her parents <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> this was taking a toll on Kate and so they changed to a school where Kate could attend as herself. As the parent learned through this experience, supporting a child’s gender identity is extremely important.|$|E

25|$|In 1982 he {{was invited}} to create a work for Documenta 7. He {{delivered}} a large pile of basalt stones. From above one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the pile of stones was a large arrow pointing to a single oak tree that he had planted. He announced that the stones should not be moved unless an oak tree was planted in the new location of the stone. 7,000 oak trees were then planted in Kassel, Germany. This project exemplified the idea that a social sculpture was defined as interdisciplinary and participatory. Beuys's wanted to effect environmental and social change through this project. The Dia Art Foundation continues his project still and has planted more trees and paired them with basalt stones too.|$|E
25|$|While Master Tara Singh {{confused}} Rajagopalchari's offer {{with the}} Muslim League demand he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> any division of Punjab {{would leave the}} Sikhs divided between Pakistan and Hindustan. He espoused the doctrine of self-reliance, opposed partition and called for independence {{on the grounds that}} no single religious community should control Punjab. Other Sikhs argued that just as Muslims feared Hindu domination the Sikhs also feared Muslim domination. Sikhs warned the British government that the morale of Sikh troops in the British Army would be affected if Pakistan was forced on them. Since Hindus seemed more concerned about the rest of India than Punjab, Master Tara Singh refused to ally with them and preferred to approach the British directly. Giani Kartar Singh drafted the scheme of a separate Sikh state if India was divided.|$|E
25|$|During {{the attack}} on Themyscira, the witch Circe showed her true colors and teleported the island into a {{dimension}} of demons in order for both tribes to be destroyed. The two tribes put aside their rivalry temporarily and fought the demons {{in order to ensure}} the Amazon survival. Though only a few months passed in the real world, the time the Amazons spent in the demon dimension lasted ten years. Discovering that Circe had made her island home disappear, Wonder Woman forced her to return it to its rightful place. Once this was done Wonder Woman learned about the invasion, the demon war, and the Amazon truce. She eventually met Artemis who was now in her mid-20s. The two got off to a rocky start but Diana <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Artemis' heart was true.|$|E

25|$|The {{collection}} {{at that time}} went from the small four-toed forest-dwelling Orohippus from the Eocene through three-toed species such as Miohippus to species more like the modern horse. By looking at their teeth he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> as the size grew larger and the toes reduced, the teeth changed from those of a browser to those of a grazer. All such changes {{could be explained by}} a general alteration in habitat from forest to grassland. And, it is now known, that is what did happen over large areas of North America from the Eocene to the Pleistocene: the ultimate causative agent was global temperature reduction (see Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum). The modern account of the evolution of the horse has many other members, and the overall appearance of the tree of descent is more like a bush than a straight line.|$|E
25|$|When Stevenson {{heard the}} {{fighting}} between Walthall and Geary, he ordered Pettus to take three regiments {{from the summit}} to assist Jackson. By this time, Moore's Alabamians were moving up amidst Walthall's retreating men, and they fired on Ireland's New Yorkers from 100 yards. Unable to see {{the size of the}} force resisting it through the fog, the Union men retreated beyond a stone wall. Moore's 1,000 men took positions in the rifle pits facing the wall and waited for the inevitable counterattack. Ireland's men were too exhausted to make an immediate move. As Whitaker's brigade arrived after 1 p.m., they stepped over Ireland's men and rushed into the attack. Candy's brigade was moving up the mountain side on Whitaker's left, followed by the brigades of Woods and Grose. Moore <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he was being significantly outflanked on the right and chose to fall back rather than be surrounded.|$|E
25|$|Captain Tracy {{and a small}} crew left Newburyport for Boston {{to take on a}} full crew for {{a six-month}} patrol. As the ship rounded Cape Ann, they spotted another sail. As the Yankee Hero was short-handed, Tracy decided to let it pass. However, some local sailors rendezvoused with them at sea and told them that several {{transports}} had been seen close to the Cape that day. Supplemented with fourteen of the local men, bringing his crew to 40 (other accounts say 52), Tracy set after the distant ship. When they had approached to within six miles, they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it was a ship of war, the HMS Milford. Still short-handed and ill-prepared for a fight, the Captain changed his mind again and ordered the ship around. However, the Milford had spotted them by this time and gave chase. Heavily outgunned and outmanned, the Yankee Hero's crew was decimated and the ship disabled. At least four of the crew were killed and thirteen wounded, including Captain Tracy.|$|E
