Based on the three level factorial design, quadratic model was developed to correlate the thermal cracking variables to total conversion and linear models for yields of total distillate fuels, gasoline, kerosene and diesel.

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to {{investigating}} some fundamentals about a <b>residue</b> <b>cracking</b> gasification (RCG) process for petroleum residues which integrates the catalytic <b>cracking</b> of the <b>residue</b> and the gasification of the cracking-generated coke. Three heat carrier particles were tested to show their different activities in <b>cracking</b> a vacuum <b>residue</b> (VR), finding that the synthesized kaolin catalyst allowed the higher liquid yield and higher conversion in comparison with silica sand and a commercial FCC catalyst. The parametric influences on the product distribution for VR cracking were thus studied over the kaolin catalyst for the major parameters including reaction temperature, catalyst-to-oil ratio, steam-to-oil ratio and different VRs. The conversion over 90 % and the liquid yield above 80 wt. % were achieved at 500 degrees C under the optimized operating conditions. The VR with higher content of residual carbon was proven to generate more coke in the cracking. The coke deposited on the catalyst was well gasified via its interaction with steam and oxygen at 800 degrees C, and the CO and H- 2 together was up to 80 vol. % in the produced syngas. The gasification-regenerated kaolin catalyst enabled the similar product distribution of VR cracking, thus justifying the technology feasibility for the tested RCG process. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In this study, the {{resistance}} of blended concrete containing catalytic <b>cracking</b> <b>residue</b> (FCC) to chloride ion penetration and carbonation was examined. FCC was added at the levels of 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % as partial replacement for cement. Concretes with 10 % of silica fume (SF), 10 % of metakaolin (MK), and without additives were evaluated as reference materials. The rapid chloride permeability test (RCPT) performed according to ASTM C 1202 standards and an accelerated carbonation test in a climatic chamber under controlled conditions (23 °C, 60 % RH and 4. 0 % CO 2), were used in order to evaluate the performance of these concretes. Additionally, their compressive strength was determined. The results indicate that binary blends with 10 % FCC had similar compressive strength to concrete without additives and had lower chloride permeability. 10 % SF and 10 % MK exhibited better mechanical behavior and {{a significant decrease in}} chloride penetration when compared to 10 % FCC. It is noted that there was an increase in concrete carbonation when FCC or MK were used as additives. It was also observed that with longer curing time, the samples with and without additives, presented higher resistance to carbonation. The accelerated corrosion test by impressed voltage was also performed to verify the findings and to investigate the characteristics of corrosion using a 3. 5 % NaCl solution as electrolyte.

40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is toxic, {{corrosive}} {{and environmentally}} damaging. It {{is not only}} found in oil and gas development, but is also often found in heavy oil exploitation. In this study, three heavy oils were selected from the Orinoco Heavy Oil Belt {{in the southern part}} of the Eastern Venezuela Basin. Thermal cracking experiments in gold sealed tubes were then conducted using the heavy oils. The objective of the experiment is to unravel the H 2 S generation mechanism and utility in establishing a development program for heavy oil thermal recovery. The results of the oil isothermal cracking experiments show that the H 2 S yield increases with the increasing cracking temperature and holding time at 150  °C and 250  °C. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is the main component in gaseous products and its concentration is more than 80 % in our experiments. The yields of CO 2, H 2 S and total hydrocarbon gas present similar varying trend that increases with increasing isothermal time. The sulfur contents in group compositions of the original oil from the CJS- 48 well and that of the residual oils with different cracking time at 250  °C were then measured. The analytical results show that most sulfur (> 75 %) exists in aromatics both in original oil and in the residual oils cracked at 250  °C, not to mention, no sulfur was measured in saturates. Although the decrease of sulfur in aromatics with the increased cracking time is low, it has great significance to the H 2 S generation during thermal recovery of heavy oil for more than 75 % sulfur existed in aromatics. The decrease of sulfur content in resin and asphaltene of <b>cracking</b> <b>residues</b> with increased <b>cracking</b> time indicates that the sulfur existed in resin and asphaltene has some contribution to H 2 S generation during the thermal recovery process of heavy oil.

These conditions should be {{at the time of the}} seeding or within 10 days of the seeding. If the required soil moisture is not present at these times, the seeds may become the target of predation by insects and other animals. Along with soil moisture, surface conditions also play a key role in the success of aerial seeding and establishment of seed. The best soil surface conditions are those that are moist and friable. A loose and rough soil surface with <b>cracks</b> or <b>residue</b> cover is also very conducive to seed germination. These conditions allow for the seed to make the best contact with moist soil while adequately allowing the seed to settle into the ground.

40|$|The {{so-called}} petroleum <b>residue</b> <b>cracking</b> gasification (RCG) process {{intends to}} convert the heavy oil first into cracked liquid by catalytic cracking and then into syngas via catalytic gasification of the cracking-formed coke. A bifunctional catalyst (BFC) was synthesized in this article and tested for the petroleum <b>residue</b> <b>cracking</b> gasification in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed reactor through comparison with the performance over an FCC catalyst. Low liquid yield of vacuum <b>residue</b> (VR) <b>cracking</b> was obtained with fresh BFC and FCC catalysts because of their strong acidity and thus activity.

The spent BFC and FCC catalysts were both in situ regenerated via steam gasification of the formed coke in the same fluidized bed reactor. This generated simultaneously syngas which contained CO and H- 2 of up to 80 vol. %, and the realized carbon conversion was over 95 % at 800 degrees C for both the catalysts. However, the regeneration time for BFC was greatly shorter than that for the FCC catalyst. This shows the much better activity of BFC for coke gasification in comparison with FCC that has almost no activity for catalyzing coke gasification.

As characterized by temperature-programmed ammonia desorption analysis, the A-FCC catalyst with moderate cracking ability was essential for optimum product distribution in vacuum residue conversion, where coke formation could be greatly suppressed via efficient oil vaporization and minimized secondary reaction. Coke removal (i. e., catalyst regeneration) of the FCC catalysts was conducted in two ways, that is, coke gasification (G-FCC) and gasification combustion (GC-FCC). During coke gasification, the sum of H- 2 and CO took up more than 80 vol % in the syngas, which could be potentially used as a hydrogen source for hydrotreating the cracked oil. Compared {{with that of the}} G-FCC catalyst, the regeneration time of the GC-FCC catalyst not only was shortened by 40 % but also had higher carbon conversion ratio and a superior recovery of pore structures. As a result, the GC-FCC catalyst showed cracking performance for vacuum residue that was better than that of the G-FCC catalyst because of its higher recovered acidity for heavy oil conversion.

A commercial FCC catalyst and a bifunctional (BF) catalyst were used as the candidates for the RCCG process, and the BF catalyst was specially designed with both catalytic effects of oil cracking and coke gasification. The regeneration characteristics and kinetics of FCC and BF catalysts were studied using a micro fluidized bed. The results showed that high-quality syngas was produced when regenerating the catalysts via steam gasification and the sum of H- 2 and CO in the produced gas was over 80 vol % under electrically heated condition. The gasification rate first increased with increasing carbon conversion and then slowly decreased. In comparison with FCC catalyst, the regeneration time of BF catalyst was shortened by more than 30 % via addition of alkaline metal oxides and adjustment of its pore size. Homogenous model (HM) and shrinking core model (SCM) were used to calculate the regeneration kinetic parameters of coked catalysts. It was found that the activation energies from these two models were close to each other, while HM had a better fitting relevance for the data than SCM. The activation energy of BF catalyst regeneration was about 115 kJ. mol(- 1), lower than that of FCC catalyst (150 kJ. mol(- 1)), demonstrating that BF catalyst was easier to regenerate via coke gasification and also justified its bifunctional characteristics. The activation energy of coke gasification on BF catalyst could be further decreased to 45 kJ. mol(- 1) when introducing 3 % oxygen as the gasification reagent. Petroleum <b>residue</b> <b>cracking</b> combined coke gasification (RCCG) process was proposed to regenerate the catalyst via coke-steam gasification for syngas production, thus {{to solve the problem}} of excessive heat generated via coke combustion in the industrial fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process. A commercial FCC catalyst and a bifunctional (BF) catalyst were used as the candidates for the RCCG process, and the BF catalyst was specially designed with both catalytic effects of oil cracking and coke gasification. The regeneration characteristics and kinetics of FCC and BF catalysts were studied using a micro fluidized bed. The results showed that high-quality syngas was produced when regenerating the catalysts via steam gasification and the sum of H- 2 and CO in the produced gas was over 80 vol % under electrically heated condition. The gasification rate first increased with increasing carbon conversion and then slowly decreased. In comparison with FCC catalyst, the regeneration time of BF catalyst was shortened by more than 30 % via addition of alkaline metal oxides and adjustment of its pore size. Homogenous model (HM) and shrinking core model (SCM) were used to calculate the regeneration kinetic parameters of coked catalysts. It was found that the activation energies from these two models were close to each other, while HM had a better fitting relevance for the data than SCM. The activation energy of BF catalyst regeneration was about 115 kJ. mol(- 1), lower than that of FCC catalyst (150 kJ. mol(- 1)), demonstrating that BF catalyst was easier to regenerate via coke gasification and also justified its bifunctional characteristics.

30|$|However, it is {{well known}} that there are various atomic scale defects, large number of wrinkles, and {{especially}} artificial <b>cracks</b> and impurity <b>residues</b> on the copper foil-based SLG films [13 – 17]. Previous studies have already primarily yielded insight into reducing all above defects density in the preparation and transfer process. Joshua determined that Cu substrate crystallography affects graphene nucleation and growth more than facet roughness by growing graphene on polycrystalline Cu with different crystal direction, coming to the conclusion that Cu (111) surface promoted few defects SLG [18]. Avouris studied the structural morphology and electronic properties in CVD graphene wrinkles by quantum transport calculations and AFM images; the maximum collapsed wrinkle height can reach about 6  nm, and the local interlayer tunneling effect across the collapsed region contributed a significant resistance to the overall device [19]. Generally, by adjusting the parameters of CVD process [20], pretreatment of copper foil [21], and surface modification [22, 23], the density of defects can be reduced to a certain extent. However, compared with these defects in the preparation process and the wrinkles caused by the transfer process, little attention has been paid to the sharp wrinkles caused by graphene duplicating the grain boundary cracks of copper foil. These grain boundary cracks, produced in Cu foil pre-annealing treatment process, are the result of polycrystalline copper recrystallizing at high temperature to form larger-size single crystal domains. Since graphene is grown on the surface of Cu foil, its topography will completely replicate the surface structure of Cu foil, including the cracks. After transferring, the cracks of graphene on Cu foil will become the sharp wrinkles on the target substrate, so sharp wrinkles are ubiquitous and inevitable on graphene film, no matter what type of transfer process used, such as mediator-assisted transfer [24], direct dry and wet transfer [25], and mass production roll-to-roll transfer [26]; these sharp wrinkles undoubtedly cause large surface roughness of graphene films, resulting in a poor performance of organic devices, especially FOLED [27].|$|R
40|$|Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used material in the construction of asphalt pavements. Approximately 650 million tonnes of asphalts for road pavements were produced, worldwide, in 2014. However, the HMA industry is responsible for a substantial consumption of energy, the creation of health and safety issues and has a negative impact on the environment. These shortcomings initiated substantial discussion within the industry with the aim to develop more environmental friendly, sustainable and economic pavement materials. These have resulted in the development of cold bitumen emulsion mixtures (CBEMs). However, to date, low early life stiffness, a slower rate of curing, the length of time necessary to achieve full strength, high air void contents and the presence of moisture in these mixtures have prevented them from being fully embraced by pavement authorities. This led to them being considered inferior to HMA {{because of a lack of}} essential mechanical properties. Currently, the use of CBEMs in pavement construction is limited to low traffic road surface course, reinstatement works and footways. Because of this, the development of CBEMs with high early strength and minimal time delay requirements before structural loading, would be considered as a breakthrough in CBEM research. This research aims to develop a novel, fast-curing and environmentally friendly, cold binder course emulsion asphalt (CBCEA) for heavily trafficked roads. The new CBCEA mixture comprises the same gradation as conventional dense bitumen macadam (DBM) mixtures which are normally used as a binder course and base in road pavements in the UK. The new CBCEA incorporates a new cementitious material, alkali activated binary blended cement filler (ABBCF), made from Paper Making Sludge Ash (PMSA) and a Fluid Catalytic <b>Cracking</b> Catalysts <b>Residue</b> (FC 3 R) activated by a waste NaOH solution (W-NaOH). Incorporation of the PMSA and FC 3 R was achieved through the replacement of conventional limestone filler (LF), while W-NaOH replaced the pre-water necessary to wet the aggregate in the CBCEA. It was found that the glass phases of the new filler particles were broken and reacted with Ca(OH) 2 creating C-S-H gel through the hydration process. This results in a very high early strength and improved mechanical properties. Balanced oxide compositions, within the new filler, were identified as responsible for an enhanced hydration reaction. A laboratory programme of testing measured the stiffness modulus, conducted at 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, 90 and 180 days. Susceptibility to temperature, wheel track testing to establish rutting resistance, fatigue resistance measured by a four-point beam bending test, fracture resistance testing via semi-circular bending tests, moisture damage resistance and ageing tests were successfully performed. Advanced techniques for microstructure assessment, i. e. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), were used to provide scientific data to provide a deeper understanding of the microstructure and internal composition. An environmental investigation was performed using a Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) test. The new ABBCF mixture offers a significant improvement in stiffness modulus compared to HMA and the reference cold binder course mixture containing conventional limestone filler (LF). Target stiffness, according to British and European standards, can be surpassed after less than one day of curing. The new ABBCF mixture offers a stiffness modulus which is 27 times better than the LF mixture after 3 days. This will overcome restrictions caused by the length of time required to achieve acceptable stiffness by traditional CBEMs. More remarkably, the new ABBCF mixture is 78 % better than mixtures treated with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) in terms of ITSM after 3 days. Furthermore, the impact of a rise in temperature on stiffness modulus from 5 to 45 °C, was much larger in LF and both HMA mixtures in comparison to ABBCF, revealing the potential to use these mixes in severe conditions, both hot and cold weathers. ABBCF mixtures displayed considerably reduced susceptibility to permanent deformation, demonstrating the potential advantage of using this material on heavily trafficked roads. Fatigue resistance was noticeably improved by the use of ABBCF in comparison to the reference LF and HMAs. Improved water sensitivity for progressive hydration with the new ABBCF was also established resulting in an enhanced long ageing performance meaning that these mixtures can be considered durable. SEM observation and XRD analysis confirmed the formation of hydration products at various curing times. The concentration of heavy metals in the samples incorporating ABBCF was observed to be less than the regulatory levels determined for hazardous materials. Microwave treatment has proven to be an effective technique to reduce the air void contents of the ABBCF mixture and achieve acceptable levels of porosity. Finally, achieving the aim of the current research will theoretically increase the application of such mixtures and allow them to be used as structural pavement materials. On a further positive note, the inclusion of waste and by-product materials in CBEMs results in more sustainable practice and eliminates disposal problems...|$|R
40|$|LectureDelayed coking is a {{refining}} process {{that consists of}} the upgrading of petroleum residues into lighter and more valuable hydrocarbon fractions by promoting thermal <b>cracking</b> on the <b>residue</b> stream. Petroleum coke is a by-product of this process and depending on its morphology {{it can be used}} as fuel for steam generation, cement calcination or as feed stock for the manufacturing of aluminum and steel. Delayed cokers are very complex systems and require a considerable amount of hardware such as fired heaters, coke drums, a main fractionator and a hydraulic decoking system. In a typical delayed coker petroleum residues are passed through fired heaters before they are charged, in an alternating fashion, into large drums as boiling product. In the drums some of this effluent thermally cracks into lighter fractions (vapors) and these are removed from the drum overhead and returned to the coker fractionator before they are sent to a gas plant for further refining. The heavier product that stays behind slowly forms into coke and it is allowed to fill the drum over time. This time is takes to do this is usually referred to as the coking cycle. Once the drum is full and the feed is switched to start filling an empty drum, a series of activities such as sludging, quenching and steam-outs are performed on the full drum prior to removing the ocke. Very high pressure water is used to cut this solid coke out and after some preparations this drum is empty and ready for a new coking cycle to begin again. As stated above, delayed coking is thus a combination of a continuous process through the fractionation tower and furnace and a batch process in the drums. As a result of this configuration the high pressure decoking pump only needs to operate a portion of the total cycle time. Regardless of its ?part-time? operation the water jet coke cutting pump is still a very important component of the hydraulic decoking system because it not only provides the required cutting pressure necessary to cut the coke but also contributes to the quality of coke removed and the duration fo the decoking cycle. Recent history shows that the majority of new hydraulic decoking installations use electric motor drived with fixed speed operation. The pump generally requires on operating speed to produce the necessary pressure to cut the coke and its flow, pressurization, and depressurization duties are controlled by a decoking control valve. During noncutting cycles operators typically shut off the motor to minimize power consumption of the system or they keep the motor running (rarely done), depressurize the line and operate this valve on bypass to recirculate the water through a holding tank until the coke cutting is resumed. Both operating alternatives have their disadvantages with regard reliability (the first) and energy consumption (the second). This paper explores the use of a hydrodynamic variable speed drive (HVSD) with an electric motor-driven pump as a way to increase the flexibility and reliability of the hydraulic decoking system. The HVSD or variable speed coupling (VSC) is able to seamlessly vary the speed of the pump and accomplish the following: Keep the motor running and operate the pump at minimum idle speed during noncutting cycles, avoiding periodic motor shutdowns and start ups; Eliminate the need for soft starter or special motor design considerations to handle periodic start ups; Reduce work and extend life of the decoking control valve by helping with depressurization duties during noncutting cycles and cutting tool mode shifting; Efficiently adjust cutting pressures depending on feed stock quality to avoid coke pulverization. This paper also describes the function of the variable speed coupling and how its unique design features are suited for the start up and intermittent operation of the water jet coke cutting pump. Field data and operator experience from two existing installations are collected and evaluated and the advantages of variable speed operation over fixed speed operation of the decoking pump are highlighted...|$|R
30|$|The <b>residue</b> fluid {{catalytic}} <b>cracking</b> unit (RFCCU) of Khartoum Refinery Company (KRC) uses conradson {{carbon residue}} and metal-contaminated feedstocks (such as atmospheric residue or mixtures of vacuum residue and gas oils) to produce more valuable products (especially gasoline) using active zeolite catalyst in a circulating fluidized bed [1]. In the RFCCU, the oil feed and dispersion steam enter the catalytic riser reactor together with the regenerated catalyst, where <b>cracking</b> of vacuum <b>residue</b> into lighter hydrocarbons starts as it contacts the hot regenerated catalyst from the regenerator. The regenerated catalyst is made to rise by steam introduced {{at the base of}} the riser reactor between the regenerator and the feed inlet point. The vaporized feed and the catalyst pass through the riser reactor into disengager for cracked products and catalyst separation. During the cracking process, coke is deposited on the catalyst, and the spent catalyst flows down by gravity into the regenerator, where air is used to burn off the coke deposited on the catalyst in a combustion environment so that it is returned to a stable state for catalysing the cracking reaction. The hot regenerated catalyst is then re-injected into the base of the riser reactor [2]. The complexity of the typical FCCU feed makes it extremely difficult to characterize and describe the inherent kinetics at a molecular level. In this way, similar components are grouped into lumps. Therefore, lumping scheme has been used to study the reactions involved in the catalytic cracking of heavy oil. To give an insight into a comprehensive prediction of products’ distribution, there is an increasing number of lumps of the proposed models for catalytic cracking reactions [3]. In the first kinetic model of Weekman [4, 5] for catalytic cracking of heavy oil, three lumps were identified as gas oil (feedstock), gasoline, and light gas[*]+[*]coke as products, without incorporating diffusion characteristics of solid and gas phases. Lee et al. [6, 7] modified the three-lump model by splitting the light gas[*]+[*]coke lump into two different lumps of C 1 –C 4 gas and coke; therefore, resulting in the four-lump model for catalytic cracking of heavy oil. Corella and Frances [8] developed a five-lump model, in which the gas oil lump was divided into its heavy and light fractions. Different modified versions of five-lump model were developed by Dupain et al. [9], Kraemer et al. [10], and Ancheyta et al. [11]. Other proposed kinetic models for catalytic cracking of heavy oil include: 6 -lump [1, 12, 13, 14, 15], 8 -lump [16], 10 -lump [17, 18], 11 -lump [19], 13 -lump [20], 14 -lump [21], and 19 -lump [22], without taking cognisance of diffusion resistance. A comprehensive review was presented by Pinheiro et al. [23] on the subject of fluid catalytic cracking process modelling, simulation, and control. Obviously, the number of lumps of the proposed kinetic models for catalytic cracking of heavy oil may be increased to obtain more detailed descriptions of the catalytic cracking reactions and product distribution [24, 25]. However, sparing kinetic investigations have been carried out with the incorporation of diffusion resistances. Taking into account mass and heat transfer resistances between the reacting fluid and solid phases helps with conceiving the lump concentration on the catalyst surface as well as temperature profiles of the fluid and solid phases. Flinger et al. [26] considered mass transfer between the fluid and solid phases in the FCCU-riser reactor model equation. Gupta and Subba Rao [27] and Nayak et al. [28] applied the relationship for Sherwood number proposed by Ranz and Marshall [29] in their model to demonstrate the effects of mass transfer. The lump concentration within the catalyst is reduced by intraparticle mass transfer. In this way, the presence of an internal concentration gradient reduces the average rate of cracking [30]. Pruski et al. [31] validated adsorption coefficients for the four-lump model of catalytic cracking of gas oil. Bidabehere and Sedran [32] set up a model to investigate the impacts of diffusion, adsorption, and reaction at high temperature inside commercial FCC catalyst pellets and analysed the significance of these phenomenon. Dupain et al. [9] discussed external and internal mass transfer relationships utilised for FCC riser.|$|R
