40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} perceptivity usage of the <b>coincidence</b> <b>method</b> for the implementation of phase measuring device. It was necessary to establish the structural elements of the measuring device. The main part. In article main types of digital phase measurers based on nonius measuring are shown. One-time nonius measurer is shown as low accuracy measurer. Multi-time nonius measurer allows to increase accuracy. This type of measurer allows fast measuring by executing in parallel multiply nonius generators, but requiring to work with special schemes to detect errors in case of wrong impulse width's. The <b>coincidence</b> <b>method</b> is known for a long time and now actively used for frequency measurement of signals. Used method is based on several coincidences of incoming and base signals. Drawback of method is dependence of measurement time and expected accuracy. In this paper the scheme for usage for measurement of a phase shift angle with usage of a <b>coincidence</b> <b>method</b> is offered. It is shown that for measurement of a phase shift by this method there is no necessity for frequency measurement of the incoming signal, as it is necessary for other implementations of digital measurement of a phase shift. Conclusions. The result of research shows the block diagram of device for measuring of phase shift angle using the <b>coincidence</b> <b>method.</b> The resulting device can receive the angle of phase shift with any duration of time measurement. Moreover, the longer the time of measurement, the greater accuracy expected. ? ?????? ????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ???????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ????????? ?????????. ????????? ?????????????? ??????????? ??????????????? ?????? ???????????? ??? ?????????? ????????? ???? ?????? ????. ?????????? ???????? ???? ?????? ??????????. ???????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ?????????? ????????? ? ?????????? ??????????, ?????????????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ????????? ??? ?? ???????? ????????? ???????, ??? ? ???????????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ??? ?????????????? ?????????...|$|E

As discussed in chapter 1, accurate knowledge of the properties of these states, the ground states, and the transitions between them is necessary for the quantitative interpretation of Mössbauer spectra. Relations are given between the parameters of a Mössbauer spectrum and nuclear spectroscopic parameters, some of which have been studied in this investigation. The delayed <b>coincidence</b> <b>method</b> for measuring lifetimes (one of the nuclear parameters) is treated in chapter 2. For the sake of completeness other methods for measuring lifetimes are also briefly mentioned. Gamma lines that show the Mössbauer effect are emitted by deexcitation of low lying levels with half-lives between about 0. 1 and 100 ns; this is in the time range where the <b>coincidence</b> <b>method</b> yields the most accurate results. ...|$|E
