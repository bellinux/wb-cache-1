Trajectories produced by the NOAA/ HAZMAT On-Scene Spill Model, using different combinations of surface currents and winds, were compared to trajectories generated using HF radar-derived surface currents. Currents examined included Output from the NOAA circulation model and canonical-day averages of the HF radar-derived current maps, either as spatially constant but temporally varying <b>currents</b> (time <b>file)</b> or spatially varying two-hourly current patterns (grids). Results from OSSM using the NOAA circulation model currents did not compare favorably with HF radar-derived trajectories inside Monterey Bay. OSSM produced realistic overall trajectory patterns throughout the Bay using the canonical-day grid <b>current</b> <b>files</b> and, to a lesser degree, canonical-day time <b>file</b> <b>currents.</b> Both OSSM and HF radar-derived trajectories show sensitivity to release time. In the afternoon, trajectories display rapid southeastward flow. At night, currents are weaker.

The model uses variable mesh-sizes {{to handle a}} more detailed tidal <b>current</b> <b>filed</b> in selected sub-regions. In this study, a three-block model scheme is developed in which the deep areas are covered by a relatively coarse grid and the shallow coastal areas by a finer grid. The third block, which is a super-fine mesh {{in the area of}} Dhahran, Bahrain and the West coast of Qatar, is included in the model to predict the more detailed tidal current field in this area. A finite difference model is utilized to solve the partial differential equations considered in the model...|$|R

50|$|Semantic file {{systems are}} file systems used for {{information}} persistence which structure the data {{according to their}} semantics and intent, rather than the location as with <b>current</b> <b>file</b> systems.

Procedures, functions, types, constants and variables could be outside of any block, and in any order.
