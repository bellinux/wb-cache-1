5000|$|At {{this point}} it would good to state {{that there are two}} types of T-1 circuits; Channelized T-1 and Full T-1 - (Channelized T-1) is where by you have 24 {{channels}} of 64k each that can carry voice traffic and commonly found as the CO (<b>Central</b> <b>Office)</b> <b>trunk</b> in a PBX. In this case a DID or Direct Inward Dial would be used. A DID is where by you would have a T-1 and have say 100 phone numbers used to dial in to a business. The chances that all 24 channels of the T-1 being used at the same time would be small, however the PBX and business would need to study the capacity needed for multi T-1s. These same T-1 channels can also be used for out bound calls as well. (Full T-1) is where you use the entire 1.544 Mb of the T-1 for data. This data can be anything from company servers or the internet. Any data can be placed on the Full T-1. It’s worth noting, you can place data on a channelized T-1, but you’re limited to the 64k bandwidth of the channel. Several channels can be used to add capacity. The T-1 uses a pair of twisted copper wires from the CO (Central Office) the local on premise NIU (network Interface Unit) card. Pictured to the above right is a two card wall mount cabinet. Under the wall cabinet is a smart jack (RJ45). The NIU then uses 4 twisted copper wires to the end device (i.e. CISCO Router, Firewall, PBX, etc.) by a Cat 3 or high network type jumper cable.|$|E
50|$|A key {{telephone}} system was originally distinguished {{from a private}} branch exchange (PBX) in {{that it did not}} require an operator or attendant at the switchboard to establish connections between the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>trunks</b> and stations, or between stations. Technologically, private branch exchanges share lineage with <b>central</b> <b>office</b> telephone systems, and in larger or more complex systems, may rival a <b>central</b> <b>office</b> system in capacity and features. With a {{key telephone}} system, a station user could control the connections directly using line buttons, which indicated the status of lines with built-in lamps.|$|R
50|$|Trunk {{lines are}} used for {{connecting}} a private branch exchange (PBX) to a telephone service provider. When needed {{they can be used}} by any telephone connected to the PBX, while the station lines to the extensions serve only one station telephones. Trunking saves cost, because there are usually fewer trunk lines than extension lines, since it is unusual in most offices to have all extension lines in use for external calls at once. Trunk lines transmit voice and data in formats such as analog, T1, E1, ISDN or PRI. The dial tone lines for outgoing calls are called DDCO (Direct Dial <b>Central</b> <b>Office)</b> <b>trunks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A private branch {{exchange}} (PBX) is a telephone exchange or switching system that serves a private organization and performs concentration of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> lines or <b>trunks</b> and provides intercommunication between {{a large number of}} telephone stations in the organization. The <b>central</b> <b>office</b> lines provide connections to the public switched telephone network and the concentration aspect of a PBX permits the shared use of these lines between all stations in the organization.

50|$|A {{telephone}} exchange name or <b>central</b> <b>office</b> name was a distinguishing and memorable name {{assigned to a}} <b>central</b> <b>office.</b> It identified the switching system to which a telephone was connected. Each <b>central</b> <b>office</b> served a maximum of 10,000 subscriber lines identified by the last four digits of the telephone number. Areas or cities with more subscribers were served by multiple <b>central</b> <b>offices,</b> possibly hosted in the same building. The leading letters of a <b>central</b> <b>office</b> name were used as the leading components of the telephone number representation, so that each telephone number in an area was unique.

40|$|Instructional {{leadership}} for school leaders is a complex, multifaceted task. <b>Central</b> <b>office</b> leaders {{can and must}} support the instructional leadership of school leaders. Yet the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> can sometimes present roadblocks that make it challenging for principals to be effective instructional leaders. Complicating matters {{is the impact of}} context, which can influence the ways that the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> supports or hinders the instructional leadership of school administrators. ^ This exploratory study examined the ways that the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> supported or hindered the instructional leadership of school administrators. It also examined the way that school district size, type and access to resources may have impacted those interactions. Participants included <b>central</b> <b>office</b> staff involved in teaching and learning as well as school principals and assistant principals in six public school districts in Pennsylvania. A qualitative design was employed. Fifty-one participants were interviewed and asked to provide documents related to curriculum, instruction, professional development, and/or assessment. ^ <b>Central</b> <b>office</b> administrators played a role in managing curriculum, assessment, professional development, and expectations in school districts. Supportive practices included fostering connections between and among school administrators, skill-building/mentoring, and shielding school administrators from community issues and state mandates. Practices that created roadblocks included lack of expertise and quality work products, failure to bring school administrators together around collaborative work, lack of trusting relationships, and failure to shield school administrators from community issues and state mandates. Tension around the balance between school autonomy and coherence to district mandates/needs, the process of change, feedback and accountability, and philosophical differences created additional roadblocks. Context was a relevant factor in the areas of trust and relationships, the amount of autonomy granted to school administrators, and the role of resources. ^ Four main conclusions were drawn. In the districts studied, there was little work on the part of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> around instructional strategies. The <b>central</b> <b>office</b> played a more direct role as instructional leaders in schools housed in smaller districts. When the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> engaged in supportive practices, fewer tensions were reported by participants within districts.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), College of Education, Washington State UniversitySchool {{district}} <b>central</b> <b>offices</b> {{have increasingly}} {{been identified as}} important actors {{in the implementation of}} new education policy initiatives. This qualitative case study focuses on {{the ways in which the}} <b>central</b> <b>office</b> in a mid-sized school district supported school principals in implementing newly adopted teacher and principal evaluation criteria. The study examined how the school district's <b>central</b> <b>office</b> supported principals in their planning, preparation, and implementation of the new teacher and principal evaluation system (TPEP) in Washington State. Two research questions guided the completion of this research study: (a) What types of activities took place between the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> and the principals; and (b) Did the principals perceive these activities as helpful to their pursuit of effective implementation of the TPEP initiative in their school buildings? The findings highlight the importance of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators as boundary spanners in supporting the principals' development as leaders who have the capacity to enact the new evaluation criteria. Two themes emerged from interviews, observations and the review of documents. First, the use of existing district structures and relationships to support implementation at the school level was vital to the successful adoption of the evaluation criteria. This included working together as partners during the implementation and using common language from previous work within the district to achieve broadly shared understanding of the evaluation requirements. The second theme highlighted the importance of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators providing everyday support to school principals. Everyday support included providing meaningful professional development; engaging in regular meetings; working and learning with the school administrators; and engaging in constant, consistent communication about the implementation of the policy. Collectively, the findings highlight how important it is that <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators consistently review their leadership practices with principals to ensure that they are providing meaningful structures and support. Further research on the ways in which <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators support principals is needed. In particular, research that focuses on how <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators measure their own practices relative to principal needs is urgently needed. Such consideration is particularly important as new policy initiatives demand that <b>central</b> <b>office</b> administrators create and establish effective support for school principals.
