We report our experimental results on the <b>failure</b> <b>current</b> density, resistivity, electromigration effect and failure mechanism of patterned stripes of Pd, Sc and Y thin-films, regarding them as the potential novel interconnects. The Pd stripes have a <b>failure</b> <b>current</b> density of (8 ∼ 10)× 106 A/cm 2 (MA/cm 2), and they are stable when the working current density is as much as 90 % of the <b>failure</b> <b>current</b> density.

40|$|Abstract]: The Project aims {{to assess}} the {{viability}} of pavement cross sections used in the Southern District of Main Roads Queensland by investigation and analysis of pavement performance for cross section types used on the Gatton Bypass Duplication (GBD). Pavement Cross Section for the GBD {{was based on a}} design adopted from the Victorian Roads Authority, VicRoads. Two significant aspects of the GBD were innovative for the Department of Main Roads; First use of VicRoads Cross Section and First use of Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) Technology to monitor moisture in the pavements. Investigation into the Pavement Performance includes; reviewing TDR data from seven installations, development of a Pavement Performance Profile from historical data and Forensic Investigation into <b>current</b> <b>failures,</b> probable causes and contributory factors. Compilation of the Pavement Performance Profile required analysis of yearly data relating to structural, functional and other attributes. The functional attributes of Rutting and Roughness were considered as they correlate well with road user expectations. Structural performance assessments were based on Deflection Testing, which indicated the pavements structural capacity to withstand current and future loadings prior to failure. Traffic Loadings and Maintenance costs, both historical and projected, were also integrated into the Profile. Forensic Investigation into the <b>current</b> <b>failures</b> included conventional methods and the modern technologies of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Closed Circuit Television (CCTV). GPR was utilised to identify anomalies and moisture within and below the pavement structure, while CCTV provided an opportunity to investigate sub-soil drains. The Pavement Performance Profile and Forensic Investigation are reconciled to produce an interrelationship between performance and failure. This interrelationship forms the basis for Distress Threshold Limits and the calculation of the Estimated Remaining Service Life of the pavement, which concludes the Project. The methodology developed for this study is reviewed and considered for its application to other construction projects completed by the Department of Main Roads. ...|$|R

An ideal surge current limiting device should have a negligible resistance for DC currents and high resistance at frequencies corresponding to transients in tantalum capacitors.

Twelve types of small size FBs from three manufacturers were used to evaluate their robustness under soldering stresses and at high surge current spikes associated with transients in tantalum capacitors. Results show that FBs are capable to withstand current pulses that are substantially greater than the specified current limits. However, due to a sharp decrease of impedance with current, FBs do not reduce surge currents to the required level that can be achieved with regular resistors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Unlike {{most other}} robots, {{autonomous}} personal transports must be designed with a passenger user in mind. This paper examines {{the integration of}} three necessary technologies for a robotic transport—in particular, a robotic wheelchair. First, local motion to a nearby goal pose needs {{to be safe and}} comfortable for the human passenger. Second, 3 D overhangs, drop-offs, steep inclines, and stairs (in addition to pedestrians and walls) need to be accurately modeled and avoided, while curb cuts, drivable ramps, and flat ground should be seen as traversable. Third, the spatial representation of the robot should facilitate infrequent requests for human directions and allow “natural ” directional commands. Furthermore, the sensorimotor system that facilitates spatial reasoning, planning, and motion needs to be cost efficient. As a result, our goal is to create a system that ultimately uses inexpensive wheel encoders and off-the-shelf stereo cameras. In this paper, we overview the three technologies listed above. We then discuss the successes and the <b>current</b> <b>failures</b> of the integration task, both of which motivate future work. I...|$|R

40|$|Solid {{tantalum}} capacitors {{are widely}} used in space applications to filter low-frequency ripple currents in power supply circuits and stabilize DC voltages in the system. Tantalum capacitors manufactured per military specifications (MIL-PRF- 55365) are established reliability components and have less than 0. 001 % of failures per 1000 hours (the failure rate is less than 10 FIT) for grades D or S, thus positioning these parts among electronic components with the highest reliability characteristics. Still, failures of tantalum capacitors do happen and when it occurs it might have catastrophic consequences for the system. This {{is due to a}} short-circuit failure mode, which might be damaging to a power supply, and also to the capability of tantalum capacitors with manganese cathodes to self-ignite when a failure occurs in low-impedance applications. During such a failure, a substantial amount of energy is released by exothermic reaction of the tantalum pellet with oxygen generated by the overheated manganese oxide cathode, resulting not only in destruction of the part, but also in damage of the board and surrounding components. A specific feature of tantalum capacitors, compared to ceramic parts, is a relatively large value of capacitance, which in contemporary low-size chip capacitors reaches dozens and hundreds of microfarads. This might result in so-called surge <b>current</b> or turn-on <b>failures</b> in the parts when the board is first powered up. Such a failure, which is considered as the most prevalent type of failures in tantalum capacitors [I], is due to fast changes of the voltage in the circuit, dV/dt, producing high surge current spikes, I(sub sp) = Cx(dV/dt), when current in the circuit is unrestricted. These spikes can reach hundreds of amperes and cause catastrophic failures in the system. The mechanism of surge <b>current</b> <b>failures</b> has not been understood completely yet, and different hypotheses were discussed in relevant literature. These include a sustained scintillation breakdown model [1 - 3]; electrical oscillations in circuits with a relatively high inductance [4 - 6]; local overheating of the cathode [5, 7, 8]; mechanical damage to tantalum pentoxide dielectric caused by the impact of MnO 2 crystals [2, 9, 10]; or stress-induced-generation of electron traps caused by electromagnetic forces developed during current spikes [11]. A commonly accepted explanation of the surge <b>current</b> <b>failures</b> is that at unlimited current supply during surge current conditions, the self-healing mechanism in tantalum capacitors does not work, and what would be a minor scintillation spike if the current were limited, becomes a catastrophic failure of the part [l, 12]. However, our data show that the scintillation breakdown voltages are significantly greater that the surge current breakdown voltages, so it is still not clear why the part, which has no scintillations, would fail at the same voltage during surge current testing (SCT) ...|$|R
