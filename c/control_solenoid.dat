50|$|In fully {{automatic}} closed-circuit systems, an electronically <b>controlled</b> <b>solenoid</b> valve injects oxygen into the loop when {{the control system}} detects that the partial pressure of oxygen in the loop has fallen below the required level.

50|$|When first developed, ECP brakes {{needed a}} number of wires along the train to <b>control</b> <b>solenoids</b> on each wagon to release the brakes, and were not {{considered}} economic for freight. This has changed {{with the introduction of}} electronic controls, allowing data to be transmitted by two-conductor wire or radio from the locomotive to a microprocessor on each car, where locally powered valves hold the desired pressure in each brake cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{algorithm}} sometimes {{involves the}} EMS (engine management system) [...] "learning" [...] {{how quickly the}} turbocharger can spool and how quickly the boost pressure increases. Armed with this knowledge, as long as boost pressure is below a predetermined allowable ceiling, the EMS will open the boost <b>control</b> <b>solenoid</b> to allow the turbocharger to create overboost beyond what the wastegate would normally allow. As overboost reaches the programmable maximum, the EMS begins to decrease the bleed rate through the <b>control</b> <b>solenoid</b> to raise boost pressure as seen at the wastegate actuator diaphragm so the wastegate opens enough to limit boost to the maximum configured level of over-boost.|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{boost control}} adds an air <b>control</b> <b>solenoid</b> and/or a stepper motor {{controlled}} by an electronic control unit. The same general principle of a manual controller is present, {{which is to}} control the air pressure presented to the wastegate actuator. Further control and intelligent algorithms can be introduced, refining and increasing control over actual boost pressure delivered to the engine.|$|E
50|$|When {{the engine}} cutoff signal was {{received}} by the electrical control package, it de-energized the main-stage and ignition phase solenoid valves and energized the helium <b>control</b> <b>solenoid</b> de-energizer timer. This, in turn, permitted closing pressure to the main fuel, main oxidizer, gas generator control, and augmented spark igniter valves. The oxidizer turbine bypass valve and propellant bleed valves opened and the gas generator and LOX dome purges were initiated.|$|E
50|$|There {{was also}} a switch pile-up under each movable rotor that was {{operated}} by cams on its plastic outer ring. Different outer rings had different arrangements of cams. The circuitry of the switches <b>controlled</b> <b>solenoids</b> which in turn enabled {{the movement of the}} rotors. The combination of cam rings and the controlling of a rotor by several switches created a most complex and irregular stepping. The exact wiring between switches and solenoids is still classified.|$|R

50|$|Most {{manufacturers}} {{adopted a}} standard top-loading format with piano key controls, dual VU meters, and slider level controls. There was {{a variety of}} configurations leading to the next standard format in the late 1970s, which settled on front-loading (see main picture) with cassette well on one side, dual VU meters on the other, and later dual-cassette decks with meters in the middle. Mechanical controls were replaced with electronic push buttons <b>controlling</b> <b>solenoid</b> mechanical actuators, though low cost models would retain mechanical controls. Some models could search and count gaps between songs.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{electronic}} {{automatic transmissions}} are still fundamentally hydraulic. This requires precise pressure control. Older automatic transmission designs only use {{a single line}} pressure <b>control</b> <b>solenoid</b> which modifies pressure across the entire transmission. Newer automatic transmission designs often use many pressure control solenoids, and sometimes allow the shift solenoids themselves to provide precise pressure control during shifts by ramping the solenoid on and off. The shift pressure affects the shift quality (too high a pressure will result in rough shifting; too low a pressure will cause the clutches to overheat) and shift speed.|$|E

50|$|The {{propellant}} {{bleed valves}} {{used in both}} the fuel and oxidizer systems were poppet-type, which were spring-loaded to the normally open position and pressure-actuated to the closed position. Both propellant bleed valves were mounted to the bootstrap lines adjacent to their respective turbopump discharge flanges. The valves allowed propellant to circulate in the propellant feed system lines to achieve proper operating temperature prior to engine start, and were engine controlled. At engine start, a helium <b>control</b> <b>solenoid</b> valve in the pneumatic control package was energized allowing pneumatic pressure to close the bleed valves, which remained closed during engine operation.|$|E

50|$|The main {{oxidizer}} valve (MOV) was a butterfly-type valve, spring-loaded to {{the closed}} position, pneumatically operated {{to the open}} position, and pneumatically assisted to the closed position. It was mounted between the oxidizer high-pressure duct from the oxidizer turbopump and the oxidizer inlet on the thrust chamber assembly. Pneumatic pressure from the normally closed port of the mainstage <b>control</b> <b>solenoid</b> valve was routed to both {{the first and second}} stage opening actuators of the main oxidizer valve. Application of opening pressure in this manner, together with controlled venting of the main oxidizer valve closing pressure through a thermal-compensating orifice, provided a controlled ramp opening of the main oxidizer valve through all temperature ranges. A sequence valve, located within the MOV assembly, supplied pneumatic pressure to the opening control part of the gas generator control valve and through an orifice to the closing part of the oxidizer turbine bypass valve.|$|E

The current study presents {{a comparison of}} two servo techniques for position control of pneumatic cylinders.

Mathematical models of the system including the nonlinearities such as mass flow rate, pressure in cylinder chambers and frictional forces are presented in this paper.

This makes precise and geometric De Rham's {{realization of the}} real homology by only using a restricted geometric subclass of currents. These generalized currents do extend Ruelle-Sullivan and Schwartzman currents. We extend Schwartzman theory beyond dimension 1 and provide a unified treatment of Ruelle-Sullivan and Schwartzman theories via Birkhoff's ergodic theorem for the class of immersions of <b>controlled</b> <b>solenoids.</b> We develop some intersection theory of these new generalized currents that explains why the realization theorem cannot be achieved only with Ruelle-Sullivan currents.

5000|$|Boost {{controllers}} {{often use}} {{pulse width modulation}} (PWM) techniques to bleed off boost pressure {{on its way to}} the reference port on the wastegate actuator diaphragm in order to (on occasion [...] ) under report boost pressure in such a way that the wastegate permits a turbocharger to build more boost pressure in the intake than it normally could. In effect, a boost-control solenoid valve lies to the wastegate under the engine control unit´s (ECU) control. The boost <b>control</b> <b>solenoid</b> contains a needle valve that can open and close very quickly. By varying the pulse width to the solenoid, the solenoid valve can be commanded to be open a certain percentage of the time. This effectively alters the flow rate of air pressure through the valve, changing the rate at which air bleeds out of the T in the manifold pressure reference line to the wastegate. This effectively changes the air pressure as seen by the wastegate actuator diaphragm. Solenoids may require small diameter restrictors be installed in the air control lines to limit airflow and even out the on/off nature of their operation.|$|E
5000|$|The Quadrajet is a [...] "spread bore" [...] carburetor; {{the primary}} {{venturis}} are {{much smaller than}} the secondary venturis. By comparison, a [...] "square bore" [...] carburetor has primary and secondary venturis of similar size. Most Quadrajets were capable of 750 ft3 L/min (cfm) maximum, but some rare Buick and Pontiac models were capable of 800 ft3 L/min for use on high performance engines, and most 1984-1987 pickup trucks were also equipped with the 800-cfm carb. Most Quadrajets use a vacuum operated piston to move the primary metering rods to control the air-fuel ratio, allowing the mixture to be lean under low load conditions and rich during high load conditions. A less-common version uses a linkage driven off the primary throttle shaft to mechanically move the power piston. [...] "E" [...] (electronic control module controlled) series of Quadrajets use a computer controlled mixture <b>control</b> <b>solenoid</b> that responds to electronic signals from the throttle position and oxygen sensors via the computer, ideal for precise fuel metering and allowing additional fuel under load. The solenoid-controlled metering rods allow the fuel mixture to be very close to optimum, then the solenoid is pulse width modulated at about 6 Hz to fine-tune the air fuel ratio under closed loop conditions. The electronic versions have a throttle position sensor that is mounted inside the carburetor body, actuated by the accelerator pump lever.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in the 1997 model year, the 2.2-litre {{engine for}} 1997 Legacy and Impreza models had {{internal}} and external changes that yield an approximately 10% increase in power and 3% increase in fuel economy.Accomplishing this involves many factors, {{one of which is}} engine friction reduction. The pistons were coated with molybdenum to reduce friction. The thin coating reduces moving friction and reduces cylinder wall scuffing.The piston skirt was reshaped and the piston weight was reduced by approximately 100 grams. Compression ratio was increased to 9.7:1 by reshaping the piston crown. This eliminates the clearance that was available between the piston at TDC and the fully opened valve.Piston pin offset has been changed to 0.5mm (0.020 in). Piston to cylinder wall clearance has been reduced by increasing the piston diameter.Another source of high engine friction is the valve train. Hydraulic lash adjusters (HLAs) are always in contact with the valves. The hydraulic pressure of the lash adjuster must be overcome during operation and during the most critical time of engine start.To overcome this situation and to contribute to the total reduction of friction loss, 1997 and later SOHC engines have solid valve adjusters. The scheduled service of this valve train is set at 100000 mi. SOHC engines now use an adjustment screw to adjust valve clearance. Engines with the earlier HLA are recommended to use 10W30 or 10W40 oil year-round; 5W30 can be used at very low winter temperatures.The roller rocker cam follower system that was introduced on the 1.8L Impreza engines, is installed on all 1996 model year and later 2.2-litre engines. The roller assemblies are not serviceable separately, but the rocker arms may be serviced as individual units.The carbon composition head gaskets with integrated o-rings are interchangeable from left to right on 1990 to 1994 NA engines only.Other Engine Modifications (2.2L 1997): The intake manifold has been reshaped to increase the airflow mass and speed, contributing to improved low and mid engine speed operation.
