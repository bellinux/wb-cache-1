30|$|In mobile positioning, {{it is very}} {{important}} to estimate correctly the delay between the transmitter and the receiver. When the receiver is in line-of-sight (LOS) condition with the transmitter, the computation of the mobile position in two dimensions becomes straightforward. In this paper, the problem of LOS detection in WCDMA for mobile positioning is considered, together with joint estimation of the delays and channel coefficients. These are very challenging topics in multipath fading channels because LOS component is not always present, and when it is present, it might be severely affected by interfering paths spaced at less than one <b>chip</b> <b>distance</b> (closely spaced paths). The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to estimate jointly the delays and complex channel coefficients. The decision whether the LOS component is present or not is based on statistical tests to determine the distribution of the channel coefficient corresponding to the first path. The statistical test-based techniques are practical, simple, and of low computation complexity, which is suitable for WCDMA receivers. These techniques can provide an accurate decision whether LOS component is present or not.|$|E
40|$|Delay {{estimation}} is {{an important}} task in Wideband CDMA (WCDMA) receivers. This is a very challenging topic when the successive paths are spaced at less than one <b>chip</b> <b>distance</b> (closely-spaced paths). Traditional Delay Locked Loops (DLLs) {{are not able to}} estimate closelyspaced path delays with good accuracy. In this paper we introduce an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) based algorithm for the estimation of closely-spaced path delays in WCDMA environments. The EKF might be applied either at sample or at symbol level and it can be also used for the estimation of the complex coefficients of the channel multipaths. The model parameters and the sensitivity to the initialization conditions are described for a practical downlink WCDMA scenario, employing root raised cosine pulse shapes. Simulation results show that EKF is fast convergent both when the estimation is done at symbol or at sample level, and the mean delay error is at most one sample for both cases of oversampling factor 4 and 8. We will show also the conditions when the convergence is not guaranteed. 1...|$|E

40|$|In WCDMA {{mobile phone}} positioning, one method {{to compute the}} {{terminal}} location in two dimensions {{is to use the}} Line-Of-Sight (LOS) distance between the mobile and at least three participating Base Stations (BSs). Correct estimation of the LOS delay will ensure correct estimation of the mobile position.

In this paper we introduce a scheme for estimating the LOS delay based on the Extended Kalman filter (EKF) with parallel interference cancellation. The scheme, which combines parallel EKF, consists on estimating the parameters of the interference and of the desired user (delays and channel coefficients) and can be generalized to N � + 1 EKF, where � is the number of BSs included in the localization procedure.

40|$|For {{several centuries}} the {{so-called}} first principles models {{have dominated the}} natural sciences. However, {{for a number of}} practical engineering problems they are difficult or even impossible to build. Another alternative is to use so-called "black-box" models (polynomial, regression models, neural networks). They can fit the data with arbitrary precision, but they are not transparent enough: their coefficients and structure is not directly related to the system being modelled. Fuzzy rule-based models and especially Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy models have gained significant impetus due to their flexibility and computational efficiency. They have a quasi-linear nature and use the idea of approximation of a nonlinear system by a collection of fuzzily mixed local linear models. The TS fuzzy model is attractive because of its ability to approximate nonlinear dynamics, multiple operating modes and significant parameter and structure variations. On-line learning of TS fuzzy models involves recursive, non-iterative clustering responsible for model structure (rule base) learning and recursive consequent parameter estimation. eTS {{is based on the assumption}} that the model structure evolves gradually instead of being known a priori. It is important to note that this evolution is much slower than the evolution of the model parameters. For the eTS the notion of informative potential of the new data sample (accumulated spatial proximity measure) is very important. It has been first introduced in the mountain clustering approach and then refined in the subtractive clustering approach. It is used as a trigger to update the rule-base. It is a great advantage of this approach that the learning can start without a priori information and only a single data sample. This interesting feature makes the approach potentially very useful in autonomous, robotic, and smart adaptive systems. Recently the evolving Takagi-Sugeno (eTS) fuzzy models and the method for their on-line identification have been extended to the MIMO case. In the present paper, the algorithm is further simplified by replacing the Gaussian membership function with Caushy one (which has important implications for real-time realisations of the algorithm on <b>chip),</b> the Euclidean <b>distance</b> with Mahalonobis one. The problem of interpretability and simplification of the rule-base during the on-line learning is studied and an effective mechanism is proposed. The upper limit of the possible number of rules in the rule base is also defined. The radius of influence of each fuzzy rule is considered to be dependent on data and its orientation.

Especially, these devices can be equipped with sensors andactuators that interact with our living environment. Barcode, smart contactlesscard, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems, wireless sensor network(WSN), and smart mobile phones are some examples which can be utilized inubiquitous computing. RFIDs and WSNs have been recognized as thetwo promising enablers for the realization of ubiquitous computing. They havesome great features such as low-cost and small- size implementation, non-line-of-sightoperation, sensing possibilities, data storing ability, and positioning. However, there are several challenges which need to be addressed. Limited lifetime is a big challenge in battery-powered devices. The implementation cost andthe size is another limiting factor. In addition, maintenance cost, longeroperation range, higher data rate, and operation in dense multipath andmultiuser environments are some other challenges. In many RFID applications a size limitationexists, and a normal off-chip antenna with half or quarter wavelength size isnot always applicable. On the other hand, adding external components such asantennas or matching networks increases implementation costs. The most limitingfactor in the cost and size reduction in existing RFID systems is theimplementation of passive components like a large antenna or a decouplingelement. Consequently having the antenna fullyintegrated on a single die {{with the rest of the}} circuit is very desirable forsuch applications. The design of theon-chip antenna in standard CMOS technology and its design challenges such asthe lossy substrate is discussed in this thesis. Besides, to remotely power thepassive <b>chips</b> at longer <b>distances,</b> also miniaturized off-chip antennas aredesigned and measured. The pros and cons of on-chip in comparison with off-chipantennas are verified. In order to achieve a higher data ratealong with low power consumption, Ultra-Wideband Impulse Radio (UWB-IR) isutilized in the uplink of the proposed tag. UWB radio with its many advantagesis recognized as a great solution for future WSN and RFID application. The UWB-IRtechnique has the possibility of achieving Gb/s data rate, hundreds of meters ofoperation range, pJ of energy per bit, centimeter accuracy of positioning, andlow cost implementation. As a result anUWB transmit antenna needs to be implemented on the chip in addition topowering antenna. However, an UWB antenna has several challenges. Ultra Wideband Radio requires operatingbandwidths up to greater than 100 % of the center frequency. Successful transmissionand reception of an ultra-wideband pulse that occupies the entire 3. 1 - 10. 6 GHzspectrum requires an antenna that has linear phase, low dispersion and a VSWR &# 8804; 2 throughout the entire band. Linear phase and low dispersion ensure low variationof group delay, which is imperative for transmitting and receiving a pulse withminimal distortion. VSWR &# 8804; 2 is required for proper impedance matchingthroughout the band, ensuring at least 90 % total power radiation. Compatibilitywith an integrated circuit also requires an unobtrusive, electrically smalldesign. The thesis is also devoted to address anddevelop the above mentioned system, UWB-IR in WSN and RFID. It focuses on the developmentof antennas for the UWB 3. 1 - 10. 6 GHz band that achieves a physically compact,planar profile, sufficient impedance bandwidth, high radiation pattern and nearomnidirectional radiation pattern. It also presents a new technique for antennaminiaturization. Then the technique is utilized in the co-design with the RFIDchip where the effect of antenna miniaturization in the UWB system is studied. Our focus is to scale down the UWB antenna and optimize the performance throughthe chip-antenna co-design. It is shown that the operation distance at a targetperformance is reduced with the antenna down scaling factor and it can becompensated to some extent by antenna-transceiver co-design. The result provesthe importance of antenna-transceiver co-design, which needs to be addressed inthe earliest phases of the design flow. Then, a wireless sensing and identificationsystem, based on a far-field wireless-powered tag with asymmetric wirelesslink, is proposed. The systememploys asymmetric communication links, i. e. UWB uplink and different ISM bandsdownlink, to achieve extremely low power and a high data rate up to 1 Mb/s. In the proposed system, the tag captures the required power supplyfrom the electromagnetic wave transmitted by a reader and transmits datathrough an ultra-low-power impulse UWB link. To prove the system concept asingle chip tag is implemented in UMC 0. 18 µm CMOS process. The measurementresults show that with the on-chip antenna 7. 5 cm distance is achievable whilewith the off-chip antennas the chip works in different ISM bands of 900 MHz, 2. 45 GHz and 5. 8 GHz. At 900 MHz the minimum sensitivity is - 19. 41 dBcorresponding to a 15. 7 meters operation range at 4 W EIRP, and an adaptive datarate up to 1 Mb/s. At the end, we propose a very simple andeasy-to-fabricate low-loss transition from a grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW) to a rectangular waveguide operational over the 91 to 113 GHz frequency band,corresponding to a 22 % bandwidth, and also over the frequency range of 180 to 230 GHz, corresponding to more than 24 % bandwidth. The proposed transitionconsists of two transitions, one from the rectangular waveguide to the slots inthe ground of the CPW, and the other one from these slots to the CPW itself. Itis shown through several simulations and measurements that the key elementswhich enable the wide bandwidth performance, are the use of a double slot, thevia placement and the matching circuit on the printed side, which have elementsthat are normally not used in such a configuration.
