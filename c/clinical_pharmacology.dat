25|$|Patients with variant {{forms of}} the gene CYP2D6 (also called simply 2D6) may not receive full benefit from {{tamoxifen}} because of too slow metabolism of the tamoxifen prodrug into its active metabolites.

25|$|Ibn Sina (Avicenna) is {{regarded}} as the most influential philosopher of Islam. He pioneered the science of experimental medicine and was the first physician to conduct clinical trials. His two most notable works in medicine are the Kitāb al-shifāʾ ("Book of Healing") and The Canon of Medicine, both of which were used as standard medicinal texts in both the Muslim world and in Europe well into the 17th century. Amongst his many contributions are the discovery of the contagious nature of infectious diseases, and the introduction of <b>clinical</b> <b>pharmacology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bromazepam is {{reported}} to be metabolized by a hepatic enzyme belonging to the Cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. In 2003, a team led by Dr. Oda Manami at Oita Medical University reported that CYP3A4, a member of the Cytochrome P450 family, was not the responsible enzyme since itraconazole, a known inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not affect its metabolism. In 1995, J. van Harten at Solvay Duphar B.V.'s Department of <b>Clinical</b> <b>Pharmacology</b> in Weesp reported that fluvoxamine, which is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, a less potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, and a negligible inhibitor of CYP2D6, does inhibit its metabolism.|$|E

2500|$|Alcohol {{intoxication}} {{has been}} shown to be directly connected to the actions of GIRK channels. [...] GIRK channels have a hydrophobic pocket that is capable of binding ethanol, the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages. When ethanol acts as an agonist, GIRK channels in the brain experience prolonged opening. [...] This causes decreased neuronal activity, the result of which manifests as the symptoms of alcohol intoxication. [...] The discovery of the hydrophobic pocket capable of binding ethanol is significant in the field of <b>clinical</b> <b>pharmacology.</b> [...] Agents that can act as agonists to this binding site can be potentially useful in the creation of drugs for the treatment of neurological disorders such as epilepsy in which neuronal firing exceeds normal levels.|$|E
