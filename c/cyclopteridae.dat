50|$|Lumpsuckers or {{lumpfish}} {{are mostly}} small scorpaeniform marine fish {{of the family}} <b>Cyclopteridae.</b> They {{are found in the}} cold waters of the Arctic, North Atlantic, and North Pacific oceans. The greatest number of species are found in the North Pacific.|$|E
5000|$|The {{family name}} <b>Cyclopteridae</b> {{derives from the}} Greek words κύκλος (kyklos), meaning [...] "circle", and πτέρυξ (pteryx), meaning [...] "wing" [...] or [...] "fin", in {{reference}} to the circle-shaped pectoral fins of most of the fish that comprise this family.|$|E
50|$|Cyclopterus lumpus, the {{lumpsucker}} or lumpfish, is {{a species}} of marine fish in the family <b>Cyclopteridae</b> (lumpsuckers). It is {{the only member of}} the genus Cyclopterus. It is found in the North Atlantic and adjacent parts of the Arctic Ocean, ranging as far south as Chesapeake Bay (rare south of New Jersey) on the North American coast and Spain on the European coast.|$|E
50|$|The Liparidae, {{commonly}} known as snailfish or sea snails, are a family of scorpaeniform marine fishes. Widely distributed from the Arctic to Antarctic Oceans including the northern Pacific, the snailfish family contains about 30 genera and 410 species. They {{are closely related to}} the sculpins of the family Cottidae and the lumpfish of the family <b>Cyclopteridae.</b> Snailfish are sometimes included within the latter family.|$|E
50|$|Georgimarinus {{barbatus}} is a lumpsucker of <b>Cyclopteridae</b> {{found in}} north Pacific Ocean. This species {{is characterized by}} the following unique apomorphies: teeth in the outer row at symphysis of premaxillae fuse with premaxillae, teeth at symphysis of dentary fuse among themselves and with dentary, forming the regular cutting edge; there are numerous barbs on the head and body; the bony plaques located in centers of connective tissue tubercles leaving the edges free. This species is the only known member of its genus, but it has traditionally been included in Eumicrotremus.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Over 85 % of all ichthyoplankton {{found in}} the study area in 1976 and 1978 were young-of-year (Y-O-Y) Boreogadus. Most of the {{remainder}} were seasnails (<b>Cyclopteridae).</b> Densities of Y-O-Y cod were related to season, depth, and (to a lesser degree) year and lodation. From June to at least mid-August, Y-O-Y cod were normally most abundant at 10 - 20 m depth and rare or absent at the immediate surface. Densities decreased below- 20 m and no Y-O-Y cod were caught at depths> 250 m. After mid-August densities decreased at all depths sampled. More Y-O-Y cod may have been present {{in the study area}} in 1976 than in 1978, and Y-O-Y were significantly longer at a given date in 1976 than in 1978...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{explore the}} {{relationships}} within Serraniformes (Li et al., 2009) using a dense taxon sampling and seven nuclear markers. Six had already used been for teleost phylogeny (IRBP, MC 1 R, MLL 4, Pkd 1, Rhodopsin, and RNF 213) at other scales, and one (MLL 2) is new. The results corroborate {{the composition of}} Serraniformes described in previous publications (some Gasterosteiformes, Perciformes and Scorpaeniformes). Within the clade, Notothenioidei and Zoarcoidei are each monophyletic. Cottoidei was not monophyletic due to placement of the genus Ebinania (Psychrolutidae). Our independent data confirm the sister-group relationship of Percophidae and Notothenioidei {{as well as the}} division of Platycephaloidei in four different groups (Bembridae, Platycephalidae, Hoplichthyidae and Peristediidae with Triglidae). Within Cottoidei, Liparidae and <b>Cyclopteridae</b> formed a clade associated with Cottidae, the genus Cottunculus (Psychrolutidae), and Agonidae. Serranidae and Scorpaenidae are not monophyletic, with the Serranidae divided in two clades (Serraninae and Epinephelinae/Anthiinae) and Scorpaenidae including Caracanthidae and the genus Ebinania (Psychrolutidae). We discuss some morphological characters supporting clades within the Scorpaenidae...|$|E
40|$|Small to {{very small}} bones (ossicles) in one species {{each of the}} {{families}} <b>Cyclopteridae</b> and Liparidae (Cottiformes) of the Baltic Sea are described {{and for the first}} time illustrated with SEM images. These ossicles, mostly of dermal origin, include dermal platelets, scutes, tubercles, prickles and sensory line segments. This work was undertaken to reveal characteristics of the morphology, sculpture and ultrasculpture of these small ossicles that could be useful as additional features in taxonomy and systematics, in a manner similar to their use in fossil material. The scutes and tubercles of the cyclopterid Cyclopterus lumpus Linnaeus are built of small denticles, each having its own cavity viscerally. The thumbtack prickles of the liparid Liparis liparis (Linnaeus) have a tiny spinule on a porous basal plate; the small size of the prickles seems to be related to their occurrence in the exceptionally thin skin, to an adaptation for minimizing weight and/or metabolic cost and possibly to their evolution from isolated ctenii no longer attached to the scale plates of ctenoid scales. Nodular ultrasculpture was found on the tubercle denticles of C. lumpus, resembling some kinds of ultrasculpture seen in Palaeozoic vertebrates. Samples from the posterior part of the head of C. lumpus and the anterior part of the trunk of L. liparis each contained an ossified sensory line segment with distinct characteristics, as also reported in other cottoids...|$|E
