40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to verify our previous hypothesis that <b>carteolol,</b> a beta(1) /beta(2) -adrenoceptor-blocking agent, is a nonconventional partial agonist of cardiac beta(1) -adrenoceptors. To this purpose, we characterized the effects of <b>carteolol</b> in guinea pig myocardial preparations and measured the affinities of <b>carteolol</b> for high- and low-affinity sites of beta 1 -adrenoceptors labeled by CGP 12177 [(-) 4 -(3 -t-butylamino- 2 -hydroxypropoxy) - 2 -benzimidazol- 2 -one]. All experiments were performed in comparison with xamoterol, a cardioselective beta(1) -adrenoceptor partial agonist. Both drugs caused cAMP-dependent positive inotropic and chronotropic effects, but <b>carteolol</b> was less effective and less potent than xamoterol, and its cardiac actions were not affected by conventional concentrations of the beta-blocker propranolol. Both <b>carteolol</b> and xamoterol antagonized the cardiac effects of isoprenaline, but although the antagonistic concentrations of xamoterol were almost equal to those producing cardiostimulation, the antagonistic concentrations of <b>carteolol</b> were 3 log units lower than those causing cardiostimulant effects. Both <b>carteolol</b> and xamoterol competed with (-) [H- 3]CGP 12177 for a high-affinity site of beta(1) -adrenoceptors, but <b>carteolol</b> showed a higher affinity than xamoterol. Moreover, <b>carteolol,</b> unlike xamoterol, bound also to a low-affinity site of the receptors. The binding affinity constants of the drugs for the high- affinity site correlated well with the respective blocking potencies against isoprenaline, whereas the affinity constant of <b>carteolol</b> for the low-affinity site was well related to its agonist potency. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that <b>carteolol,</b> unlike xamoterol, is a nonconventional partial agonist, which causes agonistic effects through interaction with the low-affinity propranolol-resistant site of beta(1) -adrenoceptors and antagonistic actions through the high- affinity site of the same receptors...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to study {{the effect of the}} beta adrenergic antagonist, <b>carteolol,</b> on the endothelium-dependent responsiveness of isolated arteries. Rings of canine coronary arteries were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording; <b>carteolol</b> inhibited the relaxation to isoproterenol and abolished the difference in responsiveness to the beta adrenergic agonist between rings with and without endothelium. <b>Carteolol</b> did not cause endothelium-dependent relaxations of femoral or coronary arteries. In bioassay experiments, <b>carteolol</b> augmented the basal release of relaxing factors from the endothelium of the femoral artery; this effect was prevented by indomethacin. In rings of femoral arteries, <b>carteolol</b> increased the endothelium-dependent relaxations induced by the alpha- 2 adrenergic agonist UK 14, 304; this was not affected by indomethacin but prevented by propranolol. <b>Carteolol</b> did not modify the endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine, adenosine diphosphate, bradykinin, thrombin and the Ca+-ionophore A 23187. <b>Carteolol</b> inhibited the endothelium-dependent hypoxic contraction of the canine coronary artery. It did not affect endothelium-dependent contractions to acetylcholine in the aorta of the spontaneously hypertensive rat. These experiments suggest that <b>carteolol</b> facilitates the abluminal release of endothelium-dependent relaxing factor caused by alpha- 2 adrenergic activation, and causes the intraluminal release of vasodilator prostaglandins. The compound prevents the endothelium-dependent contractions which are not mediated by products of cyclooxygenase. These actions may contribute to the vasodilator properties of <b>carteolol</b> in the intact organism. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIM—Carteolol is a β adrenoceptor {{antagonist}} used topically {{to reduce}} intraocular pressure, typically twice daily. In {{an effort to}} provide a once daily dosing regimen, <b>carteolol</b> was formulated with 1 % alginic acid. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy and safety of <b>carteolol</b> alginate solution in comparison with standard <b>carteolol</b> solution.  METHODS—This was a double masked, parallel group, multicentre study. Patients with ocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma (n= 235) were randomly assigned to receive either <b>carteolol</b> alginate four times daily or standard <b>carteolol</b> solution, twice daily. The masking was maintained through the use of a vehicle in the evening for the alginate group. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 15,  60, and 120  days.  RESULTS—At 0900  (presumed trough) on day 60, mean reductions in intraocular pressure (IOP) from baseline were 6. 09  (SD 2. 97) and 6. 09  (3. 18) mm Hg for the standard <b>carteolol</b> and alginate, respectively. At 1100  (presumed peak), mean reductions were 6. 51  (2. 53) and 6. 47  (2. 76) mm Hg, respectively. Results were similar at other times (day 15  and day 120). The most common side effect was transient stinging on instillation of drops, which did not differ significantly between groups. There were no differences of note in other ocular or systemic signs or symptoms.  CONCLUSION—The new alginate formulation of <b>carteolol</b> 2 % given once daily was as effective as standard <b>carteolol</b> 2 % given twice daily with no meaningful differences regarding safety. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{evaluated}} in vitro, in myocardial and vascular preparations isolated from reserpine-treated rats, the Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) of <b>carteolol,</b> a beta 1 /beta 2 -adrenoceptor blocking agent used in cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases. In spontaneously beating atria, <b>carteolol,</b> at low concentrations (0. 01 and 0. 1 muM), antagonized the positive inotropic effect of isoprenaline, whereas at higher concentrations (1 muM to 1 mM), it caused {{an increase in}} the force of contraction (EC 50 : 4. 6 +/- 0. 1 muM, E-max: 17. 1 +/- 1. 1 %, with respect to the maximum isoprenaline response) and a slight increase (7. 8 +/- 1. 9 % over basal values) in the heart rate. The positive inotropic effect of <b>carteolol</b> was abolished by concentrations of propranolol or timolol (10 muM) much higher than those blocking isoprenaline effects in the same preparations. A similar positive inotropic effect was also observed in electrically driven left atrium and in Langendorff perfused hearts. Functional and biochemical evidences supported the involvement of cAMP in the cardiac action of <b>carteolol.</b> In peripheral arteries (femoral and tail) pre-contracted with phenylephrine, <b>carteolol</b> exerted ISA-related relaxing effects, independent of the presence of endothelium and sensitive to high concentrations (10 muM) of conventional beta-blockers. On the basis of these results, we propose to categorize <b>carteolol</b> as a non-conventional partial agonist of both cardiac and vascular beta-adrenoceptors...|$|E
40|$|We {{prepared}} {{magnesium hydroxide}} (MH) nanoparticles, and investigated their effect {{when combined with}} dissolved <b>carteolol</b> on the bioavailability and intraocular pressure (IOP) -reducing effect of <b>carteolol.</b> The <b>carteolol</b> was solved in saline containing additives (0. 5 % methylcellulose, 0. 001 % benzalkonium chloride, 0. 5 % mannitol; CRT-solution). MH nanoparticles were prepared by a bead mill method with additives. Then carteolol/MH microparticle and carteolol/MH nanoparticle fixed combinations (mCMFC and nCMFC) were prepared by mixing the CRT-solution and MH particles. The transcorneal penetration and IOP-reducing effect of <b>carteolol</b> was evaluated in rabbits. The mean particle size of mCMFC was 7. 2 μm, and the particle size was reduced to 73. 5 – 113. 5 nm by the bead mill treatment. The MH particles in nCMFC remained in the nano size range for 8 days after preparation, and the amounts of lacrimal fluid and corneal damage were unchanged by repetitive instillation of nCMFC (twice a day for 4 weeks). The transcorneal penetration of <b>carteolol</b> was enhanced by the combination with MH nanoparticles, and the IOP-reducing effect of nCMFC {{was significantly higher than}} that of CRT-solution or mCMFC. In conclusion, we designed nCMFC, and showed that the high levels of dissolved <b>carteolol</b> can be delivered into the aqueous humor by the instillation of nCMFC. Combination with MH nanoparticles may achieve an enhancement of corneal penetration for water-soluble drugs. These findings provide significant information {{that can be used to}} design further studies aimed at developing anti-glaucoma eye drugs...|$|E
40|$|This {{in vitro}} study was {{designed}} to investigate whether <b>carteolol,</b> a non-conventional partial agonists of beta(1) -adrenoceptors, relaxes phenylephrine-constricted rat aorta through activation of the low-affinity state of beta(1) -adrenoceptors or antagonist effect at alpha(1) -adrenoceptors. Carteolol-induced complete concentration-dependent relaxation of phenylephrine-contracted aorta (pD(2) = 3. 65 +/- 0. 04), this effect not being modified by endothelium removal and not antagonised by NO-synthase inhibitor N(G) -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (100 microM) or cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 microM). The effect of <b>carteolol</b> was unaffected by the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (1 microM), or the beta(2) -adrenoceptor selective antagonist (+/-) - 1 -[2, 3 -(dihydro- 7 -methyl- 1 H-inden- 4 -yl) oxy]- 3 -[(1 -methylethyl) amino]- 2 -butanol (ICI 118, 551, 1 microM). Increasing concentrations of <b>carteolol</b> produced a parallel rightward shift of the concentration-response curves for phenylephrine-induced contraction, exhibiting a pK(B) of 4. 28 +/- 0. 07. <b>Carteolol</b> affinity for alpha(1) -adrenoceptors was evaluated by means of competition experiments carried out in BHK- 21 cell membranes expressing rat recombinant alpha(1 D) -adrenoceptor, the alpha(1) -adrenoceptor subtype mainly present in rat aorta. <b>Carteolol</b> competed monophasically with [(3) H]prazosin, exhibiting a pK(i) value (3. 39 +/- 0. 31) similar to its pD(2) and not very far from its pK(B). In conclusion, this study indicates that <b>carteolol</b> relaxes phenylephrine-contracted aorta through its alpha(1) -adrenoceptor antagonist properties, excluding the possibility that the relaxant effect is due to the activation of beta-adrenoceptors, particularly of the low-affinity state of beta(1) -adrenoceptors, by the drug...|$|E

DesignMulticenter, randomized, evaluator-masked (Study 1) /double-masked (Study 2), parallel-group studies. MethodsSetting: Twenty-eight clinical sites (Study 1) and 19 clinical sites (Study 2) in Japan. Study Population: Outpatients with bilateral POAG or OH whose predose IOP was 18 to < 35  mm Hg in the study eye after 4  weeks' treatment with latanoprost (Study 1) or <b>carteolol</b> (Study 2) (defined as baseline). Intervention: In Study 1, 237 patients applied OPC- 1085 EL (n = 118) or latanoprost (n = 119) for 8 weeks. In Study 2, 193 patients applied OPC- 1085 EL (n = 78), <b>carteolol</b> (n = 78), or carteolol/latanoprost concomitant therapy (n = 37) for 8  weeks. Main Outcome Measure: Adjusted mean IOP reduction at predose from baseline to week 8. ResultsIn Study 1, the adjusted mean IOP reductions (95 % confidence interval [CI]) were 2. 9 (2. 5 - 3. 3) mm Hg and 1. 6 (1. 2 - 2. 0) mm Hg in the OPC- 1085 EL and latanoprost groups, respectively (P <. 0001). In Study 2, the adjusted mean IOP reductions (95 % CI) were 3. 5 (3. 1 - 3. 9) mm Hg and 1. 6 (1. 2 - 2. 0) mm Hg in the OPC- 1085 EL and <b>carteolol</b> groups, respectively (P <. 0001).

40|$|AIM—A crossover, {{randomised}} {{double blind}} study was undertaken in 30  healthy volunteers, {{in order to}} compare the tolerance of 2 % <b>carteolol</b> with and without preservative in short term use.  METHODS—Complete ophthalmic examinations were performed before and 30,  60, and 180  minutes after instillation of one drop of the solution, and after 3  days of preservative treatment. After a 5  day washout, the same examinations were done with the second drug.  RESULTS—Results showed good general tolerance for both formulations. No significant difference in subjective tolerance, corneal aesthesiometry, punctuate keratitis, Schirmer's test, intraocular pressure (IOP) decrease (about 25 % {{in the two groups}} at 3  hours, 10 % after 3  days of treatment), resting cardiac frequency, or blood pressure was observed. However, break up time was significantly reduced from baseline by preserved <b>carteolol</b> both at 3  hours (10. 40  (5. 9) seconds to 6. 15  (3. 9) seconds, p= 0. 001) and after 3  days (7. 72  (5. 5) seconds, p= 0. 04). Preservative free <b>carteolol</b> did not significantly change the break up time (baseline 9. 08  (5. 7) seconds; 3  hours =  7. 88  (5. 5) seconds, not significant; day 3  =  8. 35  (5. 8), non-significant).  CONCLUSIONS—These results confirm that <b>carteolol</b> is well tolerated, either with or without preservative. The preservative free group showed better stability of the tear film, without loss of effect on IOP. This difference, although mild in the healthy young subjects in the present study could be much more relevant in those patients treated long term, older patients, and/or those suffering from ocular surface disorders. In such instances, preservative free drugs could be of potential benefit to protect the lacrimal fluid integrity and corneoconjunctival surface.    Keywords: glaucoma; carteolol; benzalkonium; preservatives; β blocker...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Ocular and {{cardiovascular}} effects of <b>carteolol</b> 2 %, timolol 0 O 5 %, and dummy eyedrops have been measured {{in a single}} dose double-blind crossover study in six healthy volunteers. Both drugs lowered intraocular pressure and reduced exercise-induced tachycardia. Neither produced {{a significant change in}} resting heart rate or blood pressure. The two agents appear comparable as regards ocular hypotensive {{and cardiovascular}} effects. Topical beta adrenoceptor blocking drugs (beta blockers) are now the first line of treatment in many types of glaucoma, though their use in certain indi-viduals is restricted by adverse cardiovascular or respiratory effects resulting from systemic absorp-tion. Timolol has been reported to cause brady-cardia, syncope, arrythmias, and exacerbation of obstructive airways disease. ' In theory beta blockers with differing properties such as cardioselectivity, partial agonist activity (intrinsic sympathomimetic activity; ISA) or reduced lipid solubility should offer advantages over timolol with respect to these adverse effects.

Human corneal keratocytes were cultured with RPMI- 1640 medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum. Antiglaucoma drugs were prepared from original concentrations to dilutions of 1 / 10, 1 / 100, and 1 / 1, 000.

We studied two groups : Normal group was 12 eyes of 11 normal subjects, and POAG group was 10 eyes of 7 POAG patients. Moreover, we examined the effect of β-blocking instillation by 2 % <b>carteolol</b> in POAG.

40|$|Abstract I Urine {{specimens}} containing 11 common {{beta blockers}} were processed using solid-phase extraction technology {{to extract the}} drugs from the urine matrix, then converted to their cyclic methaneboronates by treatment with methaneboronic acid in ethyl acetate. The compounds tested included acebutolol, alenolol, alprenolol, bisoprolol, betaxolol, <b>carteolol,</b> penbutolol, propranolol, pindolol, fimolol, nadolol, sotalol, labetolol, metoproJol, and oxprenolol. The extraction efficlencies were greater than 90 % for all drugs tested. The cyclic methaneboronates formed by this procedure generally possessed good chromatographic properties. The mass spectral behavior of the methaneboronates was excellent, with all compounds containing several high mass fragments and every tested compound possessing a unique mass spectrum...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the clinical effect of trabeculectomy combined with amniotic membrane transplantation {{in the treatment}} of neovascular glaucoma(NVG). METHODS: Forty-two cases(42 eyes) with NVG were performed trabeculectomy combined with amniotic membrane transplantation. The vision acuity, intraocular pressure(IOP), anterior chamber depth, hyphema, iris neovascularization and filtering bleb after operation were observed. All patients were followed up for 6 - 12 months. RESULTS: IOP were controlled in less than 21 mmHg in 34 cases postopeartively. Symptoms of 6 cases were alleviated, and the IOP were controlled in less than 21 mmHg with treatment of <b>carteolol</b> hydrochloride eye drops 6 - 12 months after operation. CONCLUSION:Trabeculectomy combined with amniotic membrane transplantation is an ideal treatment for NVG...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the comparative efficacy of latanoprost monotherapy versus combined <b>carteolol</b> and pilocarpine therapy {{in patients with}} newly diagnosed glaucoma. Methods: Masked randomized prospective trial. This study included 51 patients (64 eyes) with newly diagnosed glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The cases were randomly divided into two treatment groups for administration of latanoprost 0. 005 % once daily, or of car-teolol 2 % twice daily and pilocarpine 2 % twice daily. Mean diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at baseline, week 2, week 4, and month 3 after the beginning of treat-ment. Changes in mean IOP from baseline to the 3 -month visit were determined by an analy-sis of variance. Results: Mean diurnal IOP values were 25. ...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. Quaternary {{ammonium}} ions {{have been}} demonstrated to induce apoptosis correlated with superoxide anion production in vitro. The {{purpose of this study}} was to further investigate the mechanisms of benzalkonium chloride (BAC), unpreserved and preserved �-blocker eye-drops–induced programmed cell death, with special attention to the roles of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and intracellular reduced glutathione. METHODS. Chang conjunctival cells were incubated with different concentrations of unpreserved or preserved timolol (0. 1 %, 0. 25 %, and 0. 4 %), or <b>carteolol</b> (1 % and 2 %), or BAC (0. 0001 % to 0. 01 %) for 15 minutes, or for 15 minutes with a 24 -hour recovery period in normal medium.

40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} {{the long term}} efficacy of monotherapy with topically applied β blocking agents and to determine whether selective β blockers were able to preserve the visual field more effectively than non-selective agents.  METHOD—A prospective randomised, open, comparative study of three topically applied β blockers—timolol, betaxolol, and carteolol—was carried out on 153  patients (280  eyes) with newly diagnosed open angle glaucoma. Those patients who were not withdrawn were followed by the same observers {{for a minimum of}} 2  years and a maximum of 7  years, with clinical observations, Goldmann tonometry and 24. 2  Humphrey visual field analysis.  RESULTS—All three drugs lowered the IOP significantly from untreated levels but betaxolol took up to 12  months in some instances to reach the maximum pressure reduction. After 7  years only 43 % of the eyes begun on timolol, 34 % of those started on <b>carteolol,</b> and 29 % of those on betaxolol were still being treated with these medications alone. Visual fields were analysed throughout the trial by CPSD and MD and at the end by linear regression analysis (PROGRESSOR). The visual fields remained the same without apparent improvement or deterioration throughout the period of follow up. Eight patients (11  eyes) were withdrawn because of continuing field loss in spite of reduction in IOP (six using <b>carteolol</b> and five using betaxolol).  CONCLUSIONS—Analysis shows that less than half the eyes initially treated with topical β blockers might be expected to still be being treated with their original medication after 5  years. The rest required either additional medication or trabeculectomy. There was no statistically significant improvement or deterioration in the visual fields over a 7  year period. On the evidence of this trial there are no particular advantages in using selective β blockers. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this work}} we have {{compared}} three analytical techniques (ELISA, GC-MS, and LC-MS) {{for the analysis}} of 16 beta-blockers: acebutolol, alprenolol, atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, <b>carteolol,</b> labetalol, metipranolol, metoprolol, nadolol, oxprenolol, pindolol, propranolol, sotalol, timolol, and bupranolol. Several sample-preparation methods were optimized for each technique and enabled compounds of interest to be extracted from small urine samples (1 - 2. 5 mL). The results enabled us to assess the possibilities and the sensitivity of each technique for application to doping tests. ELISA, whose selectivity is very poor and sensitivity the lowest one, is, nevertheless, useful as a rapid screening method. GC/MS and LC/MS provide confirmation procedures with the identification and quantification of the beta-blockers with good sensitivity, accuracy, precision. The LC-MS analytical procedure allows the determination of the target analytes in the lower ng/mL range (0. 53 - 2. 23 ng/mL). The methodology was applied to the analysis of beta-blockers in different urines...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the various}} {{antiglaucoma}} drugs including betaxolol, timolol, levobunolol, <b>carteolol,</b> brimonidine, dipivefrin, dorzolamide, brinzolamide, latanoprost, unoprostone, and pilocarpine {{were used to}} investigate the effects of cellular cytotoxicity in cultured bovine corneal endothelial cells. After exposure to the drugs in three dilutions, 1 / 100, 1 / 1, 000, and 1 / 10, 000, for 100 minutes, cells were estimated based on the release assay of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme. It was found that cellular LDH was significantly released in the medium only at 1 / 100 th dilution of betaxolol, brimonidine, dorzolamide, dipivefrin, latanoprost and unoprostone to 130 %, 123 %, 145 %, 157 %, 128 % and 237 %, respectively, compared with controls upon exposure to drugs for 100 minutes. Moreover, benzalkonium chloride preservative at the concentrations ranging from 0. 001 to 0. 00001 mg/mL did not affect cellular LDH release in bovine corneal endothelial cells. These results indicate that high concentrations of antiglaucoma drugs may induce cytotoxicity in corneal endothelial cells...|$|E
40|$|AIM:To {{study the}} effect of only {{latanoprost}} eye drops or combined with other medicines on lowering intraocular pressure(IOP) after early pars plana vitrectomy(PPV) for macular hole without retinal detachment caused by high myopia. METHODS:One hundred and eighty-eight cases(205 eyes) suffered from macular hole caused by high myopia without reinal detachment who underwent PPV combined with C 3 F 8 tamponade were studied retrospectively and measured the IOP at 1 wk after surgeries. The patients whose IOP was 22 ～ 29 mmHg were named as group A. Then they were divided randomly into two subgroups, group A 1 (treated by <b>carteolol</b> eye drops) and subgroup A 2 (treated by latanoprost eye drops). The patients whose IOP was 30 ～ 39 mmHg were named as group B. Then they were divided randomly into two subgroups, group B 1 (treated by both <b>carteolol</b> and brimonidine tartrate eye drops) and subgroup B 2 (treated by both latanoprost and <b>carteolol</b> eye drops). The patients whose IOP was ≥ 40 mmHg were named as group C {{and they were all}} treated by rapid intravenous injection of 20 % Mannitol. Meanwhile, they were divided randomly into two subgroups, group C 1 (treated by carteolol,brimonidine tartrate and brinzolamide eye drops) and subgroup C 2 (treated by carteolol,brimonidine tartrate and latanoprost eye drops). Continuous observation lasted 3 d. If IOP dropped to below 21 mmHg, we considered it valid. And then,compare the effectiveness, IOP reduction and the average effective duration. RESULTS:Eighty-nine eyes met the criteria of high IOP and IOP of 70 eyes(78. 6 %) increased within 3 d after operations. There were 31 eyes in group A including 14 eyes in group A 1 and 17 eyes in group A 2. The number of effective cases of the two groups was 5 (35. 7 %) and 13 (76. 5 %) respectively, the difference was statistically significant(χ 2 = 5. 24, P = 0. 03). The IOP reduction of the two groups were 4. 21 ± 1. 22 mmHg(24 %), 8. 76 ± 3. 03 mmHg(29. 6 %), respectively, and the difference was statistically significant(t = 5. 73, P t = 2. 85, P = 0. 012). There were 32 eyes in group B including 17 eyes in group B 1 and 15 eyes in group B 2. The number of effective cases of the two groups was 9 (52. 9 %) and 11 (73. 3 %),respectively, and the difference was not statistically significant(χ 2 = 1. 40, P = 0. 30). The IOP reduction of the two groups was 10. 59 ± 2. 72 mmHg(36. 9 %), 16. 53 ± 2. 67 mmHg(43. 8 %) respectively, and the difference was statistically significant(t = 6. 27, P t = 3. 34, P = 0. 004). There were 26 eyes in group C including 14 eyes in group C 1 and 12 eyes in group C 2. The number of effective cases of the two groups was 9 (64. 3 %) and 8 (66. 7 %) respectively, and the difference was not statistically significant(P = 0. 70). The IOP reduction of the two groups was 22. 00 mmHg(51. 0 %), 31. 45 mmHg(59. 3 %) respectively, and the difference was statistically significant(t = 18. 35, P t = 2. 97, P = 0. 009). CONCLUSION:PPV treating macular hole caused by high myopia is associated with highe rates of IOP increasing, which generally occurs within 3 d after the operation. Alone or in combination, latanoprost eye drops can effectively reduce IOP...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{a case in}} which Descemet's membrane interfered with aqueous humor drainage through an ExPRESS mini shunt. This problem was successfully solved by Nd:YAG laser membranotomy. Case Report: A 70 -year-old male, diagnosed with corticosteroid-induced glaucoma in his right eye, presented to our hospital. Topical betamethasone treatment was discontinued, and the patient was treated with intravenous D-mannitol and acetazolamide, followed by oral acetazolamide, oral potassium L-aspartate, topical dorzolamide hydrochloride, topical <b>carteolol</b> hydrochloride, and topical latanoprost. However, his right intraocular pressure (IOP) remained elevated. We performed ExPRESS shunt surgery in the patient's right eye. His postoperative IOP was initially within the normal range, but it reincreased 1 month after surgery. We found that the Descemet's membrane was interfering with both the primary (axial) and reserve orifices {{at the tip of the}} ExPRESS mini shunt. Nd:YAG laser membranotomy was performed and the patient's IOP again improved without any other medical treatment. Conclusion: Descemet's membrane interfered with aqueous humor drainage via ExPRESS mini shunt, causing an increased IOP, which was resolved by Nd:YAG laser membranotomy...|$|E
40|$|The type of {{adrenoceptor}} {{involved in}} the contractile response to catecholamines in smooth muscle strips isolated from rainbow trout stomach was determined. Noradrenaline (10 nM- 10 microM) and adrenaline (10 nM- 3 microM) caused non-sustained contractions which were markedly decreased by phentolamine (5. 4 microM) but not by <b>carteolol</b> (5 microM). Phenylephrine (1 microM- 1 mM) was less effective in causing muscle contraction and methoxamine produced no contraction. Clonidine (100 nM- 300 microM) caused no mechanical response but inhibited the contraction to noradrenaline or adrenaline but not acetylcholine or 5 -hydroxytryptamine. Yohimbine (10 nM- 1 microM) decreased the contraction induced by noradrenaline or adrenaline but prazosin (1 microM) did not. Tetrodotoxin (780 nM) partially reduced the contraction induced by noradrenaline or adrenaline but atropine (500 nM) did not. In the presence of atropine (1 microM), electrical transmural stimulation caused frequency-dependent, tetrodotoxin-sensitive contractions. These {{results suggest that the}} contractile response induced by noradrenaline or adrenaline is mediated by alpha 2 -adrenoceptors. It is also suggested that noradrenaline and adrenaline contract the smooth muscle by direct action and by indirect action through the non-cholinergic excitatory nerve...|$|E
