5000|$|In the 1990s, {{telecommunications}} {{companies who}} previously offered primarily dedicated point-to-point data circuits, began offering {{virtual private network}} (VPN) services with comparable quality of service but {{at a much lower}} cost. By switching traffic to balance utilization as they saw fit, they were able to optimize their overall network usage. The <b>cloud</b> <b>symbol</b> was used to denote the demarcation point between that which was the responsibility of the provider and that which was the responsibility of the users. Cloud computing extends this boundary to cover servers as well as the network infrastructure.|$|E
5000|$|The female white sheep {{are entirely}} passive {{most of the}} time and await Sven's attention. Their current [...] "happiness" [...] status is shown by a sun and <b>cloud</b> <b>symbol</b> above their head. If that symbol turns into a {{lightning}} symbol (due to Sven's lack of attention, or because he ate a foul-smelling mushroom), they turn red, grow horns, run around and electrocute Sven, which, in itself, merely causes a loss of points, but will also paralyze him for a short while which may allow an enemy to capture him. Before they turn red, Sven can whistle to them to cheer them up.|$|E
50|$|The {{mask that}} {{represents}} Eototo {{is a sort}} of white cylinder with a nest of hair on his head. When calling upon clouds to provide rain for crops, Eototo draws <b>cloud</b> <b>symbols</b> in cornmeal on the ground.|$|R
50|$|The goddess was revered in a {{ceremony}} called Hako. The ceremony used an ear of corn (maize) painted blue to represent the sky and white feathers attached to represent a <b>cloud</b> as a <b>symbol</b> of Atira.|$|R
5000|$|Daniel 4's tree {{parallels}} the similar image in Ezekiel 31, where the pharaoh of Egypt {{is compared to}} a mighty tree towering above all others with its top in the <b>clouds,</b> a <b>symbol</b> of human arrogance about to be cut down. The metaphor then switches to depict Nebuchadnezzar as a beast dependent on grace for its survival until he learns humility before God. Possibly significantly, the king is restored when he [...] "lifts up" [...] his eyes to heaven.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s, {{telecommunications}} companies, {{who previously}} offered primarily dedicated point-to-point data circuits, began offering {{virtual private network}} (VPN) services with comparable quality of service, but at a lower cost. By switching traffic as they saw fit to balance server use, they could use overall network bandwidth more effectively. They began to use the <b>cloud</b> <b>symbol</b> to denote the demarcation point between what the provider was responsible for and what users were responsible for. Cloud computing extended this boundary to cover all servers {{as well as the}} network infrastructure. As computers became more diffused, scientists and technologists explored ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time-sharing. They experimented with algorithms to optimize the infrastructure, platform, and applications to prioritize CPUs and increase efficiency for end users.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the term cloud {{computing}} is unclear. The word cloud is commonly used in science to describe a large agglomeration of objects that visually appear from a distance as a cloud and describes any set of things whose details are not further inspected in a given context. Another {{explanation is that the}} old programs that drew network schematics surrounded the icons for servers with a circle, and a cluster of servers in a network diagram had several overlapping circles, which resembled a cloud. In analogy to the above usage, the word cloud was used {{as a metaphor for the}} Internet and a standardized cloud-like shape was used to denote a network on telephony schematics. Later it was used to depict the Internet in computer network diagrams. With this simplification, the implication is that the specifics of how the end points of a network are connected are not relevant for the purposes of understanding the diagram. The <b>cloud</b> <b>symbol</b> was used to represent networks of computing equipment in the original ARPANET by as early as 1977, and the CSNET by 1981—both predecessors to the Internet itself.|$|E
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is {{a general}} term for anything that involves delivering hosted services over the Internet. These services are broadly divided into three categories: Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-asa-Service (SaaS). The name cloud computing {{was inspired by the}} <b>cloud</b> <b>symbol</b> that's often used to represent the Internet in flowcharts and diagrams. It is the 5 th generation of computing after mainframe, personal computer, client server computing and the web. In this certain application, limitation and future scope of this technology was discussed...|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{structure}} of the SYNOP code, a maximum of three <b>cloud</b> <b>symbols</b> can be plotted for each reporting station that appears on the weather map. All cloud types are coded and transmitted by trained observers then plotted on maps as low, middle, or high-étage using special symbols for each major cloud type. Any cloud type with significant vertical extent that can occupy more than one étage is coded as low (cumulus and cumulonimbus) or middle (nimbostratus) depending on the altitude level or étage where it normally initially forms aside from any vertical growth that takes place. The symbol used on the map for each of these étages at a particular observation time is for the genus, species, variety, mutation, or cloud motion that is considered most important according to criteria set out by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). If these elements for any étage at the time of observation are deemed to be of equal importance, then the type which is predominant in amount is coded by the observer and plotted on the weather map using the appropriate symbol. Special weather maps in aviation show areas of icing and turbulence.|$|R
50|$|The {{subject is}} a young girl portrayed at half length in profile, facing left. Her breasts are bared and a small snake twines around the {{necklace}} she is wearing. In the background is an open landscape, arid {{on the left and}} lush on the right. The dark <b>clouds</b> are a <b>symbol</b> of her early death, as is the dead tree in the background. At the base of the painting is a border with an inscription that mimics carved letters, a method used in art since the Flemish painter Jan van Eyck {{at the beginning of the}} century; it reads: SIMONETTA IANUENSIS VESPUCCIA.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- Free space optical {{technology}} uses {{light wave}} travelling in free space to wirelessly transmit data for telecommunication. FSO {{is used in}} such places where physical optical wire usage is not possible or it is too costly. In this study {{the performance of the}} differentially coherent detected signal based FSO communication system is investigated considering the effect of <b>cloud</b> caused Inter <b>Symbol</b> Interference (ISI). To mitigate the effect of fading, the differential coherent detection technique is employed. BER performance is analysed in both absence and the presence of ISI. BER performance is also analysed with BPSK-SIM,DPSK, DPSK-SIM, M-ary PPM and PolSK modulation schemes. Graphs taken with the help of MATLAB/OPTISIM at different carrier wavelength is analysed...|$|R

In this paper, we are focusing on the impressive usage of this computing which is get benefited by its cloud like service. For a large organization where no of departments are integrated, we can reduce the overall cost of computing by the usage of private cloud of the organization. But the same cloud will be served as public within the organization as per the role of the user...|$|E

A cloud service has three distinct characteristics that differentiate it from traditional hosting. It is sold on demand, typically by the minute or the hour; it is elastic [...] which means that a user can have as much or as little of a service as they want at any given time; and the service is fully managed by the provider. Significant innovations in virtualization and distributed computing, as well as improved access to high-speed Internet and a weak economy, have accelerated interest in cloud computing. This article has been tried to explain cloud computing structure and benefits...|$|E

5000|$|The four-storey {{building}} with residential attics has a [...] "U" [...] footprint with two outbuilding wings. The front elevation is symmetrical, flanked by two-storey loggias, topped by triangular bay windows surmounted by balconies. Slight avant-corps can be noticed, capped by gables with semicircular pediments. Bay {{windows of the}} second floor are adorned with plant decoration and heraldic cartouches, including a woman head, Bydgoszcz coat of arms, a cog and a head of Hercules. The portal frame displays an allegorical scene with putti blowing <b>clouds,</b> as a <b>symbol</b> of stripping away worries of home residents. The building has preserved most of its original woodwork and windows decoration, but only part of its stuccoes in the residential area.|$|R
40|$|Cloud Computing (CC) {{has been}} {{attracting}} {{a huge amount}} of interest in the post-dotcom boom and bust and the current web 2. 0 information technology world. More recently, the momentum gained by the technology has been so significant that GSA (General Services Administration) in the USA has announced a Federal Cloud Computing Initiative (FedComp, 2009). Cloud computing is a general term for anything that involves delivering hosted services over the Internet. The term cloud computing was coined by the <b>cloud</b> <b>symbol</b> often used to represent the Internet in schematic diagrams. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, 2009) in the USA has provided a draft Working Definition of Cloud Computing – “Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e. g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction”. This paper investigates the relevance and impact of CC for Construction IT and proposes a framework for implementing a cloud based system for design and construction...|$|E
