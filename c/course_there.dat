5|$|Soon after {{founding}} the Scout movement, Robert Baden-Powell saw {{the need}} for leader training. Early Scoutmaster training camps were held in London and Yorkshire. Baden-Powell wanted practical training in the outdoors in campsites. World War I delayed the development of leader training, so the first formal Wood Badge course was not offered until 1919. Gilwell Park, just outside London, was purchased specifically to provide a venue for the course and the Opening Ceremonies were held on July 26, 1919. Francis Gidney, the first Camp Chief at Gilwell Park, conducted the first Wood Badge <b>course</b> <b>there</b> from September 8–19, 1919. It was produced by Percy Everett, the Commissioner of Training, and Baden-Powell himself gave lectures. The course was attended by 18 participants, and other lecturers. After this first course, Wood Badge training continued at Gilwell Park, and it became the home of leadership training in the Scout movement.|$|E
5|$|There is a Practice mode {{which allows}} the player to {{practice}} any track with opponents. Time Attack lets the player choose a track and complete a 3-lap race in the shortest time possible. Transparent re-enactments of Time Attack performances, or ghost data, from the player or game developer can be raced against. Up to 3 player-contributed ghosts can be raced against simultaneously, but only one can be saved per track. Death Race has the player annihilating the 29 other racers as speedily as possible on a specialized <b>course.</b> <b>There</b> is no selectable difficulty level, or set amount of laps, but the boost is immediately available. Vs. Battle is the multiplayer mode where 2 to 4 players compete in a 3-lap race, and slots not in use by players can be operated by the artificial intelligence. A slot machine for those {{out of the race}} early will appear if the option is enabled. Players can adversely affect the energy levels of those still competing by matching symbols.|$|E
