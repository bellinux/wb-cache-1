40|$|Abstract: Purpose: To {{evaluate}} long-term functional outcomes {{after surgery}} for congenital and developmental <b>cataracts.</b> Methods: In this retrospective interventional study, patients with congenital and developmental <b>cataracts</b> observed from 1996 to 2013 were included. Traumatic <b>cataracts</b> and <b>cataracts</b> secondary to other pathologies {{were excluded from}} the study. Minimum follow-up for inclusion was five years. Results: We included 117 patients operated on for congenital <b>cataracts</b> (58 females and 59 males, mean age 0. 59 ± 0. 2 years, 160 eyes) and 73 patients operated on for developmental <b>cataracts</b> (32 females and 41 males, mean age 6. 63 ± 0. 7 years, 121 eyes). Mean postsurgical follow-up was 9. 26 ± 1. 3 years (range, 5 – 14 years). After surgery for developmental <b>cataracts,</b> both distance and near BCVA were greater (p = 0. 001), as was the presence of binocular vision (p = 0. 001), while incidence of strabismus and myopic shift was lower (p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 02, respectively).

5|$|In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, {{who headed}} up the Niagara Falls <b>Cataract</b> Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system {{would be best to}} {{transmit}} power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.|$|E
