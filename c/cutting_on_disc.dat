50|$|The Swap Magic disc {{allows the}} user to boot into {{software}} which allows the system to read discs that it would normally refuse {{because of the lack}} of a burst <b>cutting</b> area <b>on</b> <b>discs</b> that have been burned with an ordinary DVD drive, as opposed to regular retail discs which are stamped or pressed en masse. The user then removes the disc (after installing small modifications to prevent the system from detecting the drive being opened) and replaces it with another disc which can then be started. The software also allows other homebrew software to be run from a memory card or USB flash drive.|$|R
50|$|After HD DVD was discontinued, Blu-ray {{became the}} de facto high-definition optical disc format. However, sales figures suggest that DVD is in no {{immediate}} danger of disappearing. All standard DVDs will play on existing Blu-ray players, making the switch to Blu-ray much easier than the switch from VHS to DVD. Moreover, some labels are <b>cutting</b> back <b>on</b> Blu-ray <b>Disc</b> releases in favor of DVD-Video, claiming that low sales do not justify the more expensive Blu-ray Disc format. In addition, {{a growing number of}} hardware vendors are enhancing their Blu-ray players with Internet connectivity for subscription-based video downloads.|$|R
