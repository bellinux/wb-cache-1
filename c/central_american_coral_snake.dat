50|$|The <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> {{is capable}} of growing to 115 cm, but most are closer to 65 cm. They have smooth scales, a rounded head, and eyes with round pupils. Its color pattern can vary from two-colored to three-colored, with black, yellow and red banding. The snout is black. Halfway the head, there is usually a yellow ring (in three-colored specimens) or a red ring (in bi-colored specimens). Color pattern on the body {{consists}} of often fairly broad red bands separated by much narrower sets of yellow-black-yellow bands.

40|$|Snakebite envenomings {{represent}} a neglected public health issue {{in many parts}} of the rural tropical world. Animal-derived antivenoms have existed for more than a hundred years and are effective in neutralizing snake venom toxins when timely administered. However, the low immunogenicity of many small but potent snake venom toxins represents a challenge for obtaining a balanced immune response against the medically relevant components of the venom. Here, we employ high-throughput sequencing of the immunoglobulin (Ig) transcriptome of mice immunized with a three-finger toxin and a phospholipase A 2 from the venom of the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>coral</b> <b>snake,</b> Micrurus nigrocinctus. Although exploratory in nature, our indicate results showed that only low frequencies of mRNA encoding IgG isotypes, the most relevant isotype for therapeutic purposes, were present in splenocytes of five mice immunized with 6 doses of the two types of toxins over 90 days. Furthermore, analysis of Ig heavy chain transcripts showed that no particular combination of variable (V) and joining (J) gene segments had been selected in the immunization process, as would be expected after a strong humoral immune response to a single antigen. Combined with the titration of toxin-specific antibodies in the sera of immunized mice, these data support the low immunogenicity of three-finger toxins and phospholipases A 2 found in M. nigrocinctus venoms, and highlight the need for future studies analyzing the complexity of antibody responses to toxins at the molecular level.

40|$|Embargo por política {{editorial}} 2081 - 01 - 21 The proteome of {{the venom}} of Micrurus nigrocinctus (<b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>coral</b> <b>snake)</b> was analyzed by a “venomics” approach. Nearly 50 venom peaks {{were resolved by}} RP-HPLC, revealing a complex protein composition. Comparative analyses of venoms from individual specimens revealed that such complexity is an intrinsic feature of this species, rather {{than the sum of}} variable individual patterns of simpler composition. Proteins related to eight distinct families were identified by MS/MS de novo peptide sequencing or N-terminal sequencing: phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2), three-finger toxin (3 FTx), l-amino acid oxidase, C-type lectin/lectin-like, metalloproteinase, serine proteinase, ohanin, and nucleotidase. PLA 2 s and 3 FTxs are predominant, representing 48 and 38 % of the venom proteins, respectively. Within 3 FTxs, several isoforms of short-chain α-neurotoxins as well as muscarinic-like toxins and proteins with similarity to long-chain κ- 2 bungarotoxin were identified. PLA 2 s are also highly diverse, and a toxicity screening showed that they mainly exert myotoxicity, although some are lethal and may contribute to the known presynaptic neurotoxicity of this venom. An antivenomic characterization of a therapeutic monospecific M. nigrocinctus equine antivenom revealed differences in immunorecognition of venom proteins that correlate with their molecular mass, with the weakest recognition observed toward 3 FTxs.

40|$|Versión final embargada hasta el 2081 - 12 por política editorialVenoms of the redtail {{coral snake}} Micrurus mipartitus from Colombia and Costa Rica were {{analyzed}} by “venomics”, a proteomic strategy to determine their composition. Proteins were separated by RP-HPLC, followed by SDS-PAGE, in-gel tryptic digestion, identification by MALDI or ESI tandem mass spectrometry, and assignment to known protein families by similarity. These analyses were complemented with a characterization of venom activities in vitro and in vivo. Proteins belonging to seven families were found in Colombian M. mipartitus venom, including abundant three-finger toxins (3 FTx; ~ 60 % of total proteins) and phospholipases A 2 (PLA 2; ~ 30 %), with the remaining ~ 10 % distributed among L-amino acid oxidase, P-III metalloproteinase, Kunitz-type inhibitor, serine proteinase, and C-type lectin-like families. The venoms of two M. mipartitus specimens from Costa Rica, {{also referred to as}} M. multifasciatus in some taxonomic classifications, were also analyzed. Both samples were highly similar to each other, and partially resembled the chromatographic and identity profiles of M. mipartitus from Colombia, although presenting a markedly higher proportion of 3 FTxs (~ 83. 0 %) in relation to PLA 2 s (~ 8. 2 %), and a small amount of acetylcholinesterase, not detected in the venom from Colombia. An equine antivenom against the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> <b>coral</b> <b>snake,</b> M. nigrocinctus, did not recognize venom components of M. mipartitus from Colombia or Costa Rica by enzyme-immunoassay. Four major components of Colombian M. mipartitus venom were isolated and partially characterized.

40|$|Due to shared coevolutionary {{history of}} snakes and {{primates}} with snakes acting as their main predators, snakes elicit fear {{in most of}} the primates, humans included. Humans are able to notice a stimulus that elicits fear, e. g., a snake, much faster. Such ability might have surely positively affected their survival in the past. In the nature, aposematic coloration acts as a warning of a dangerous prey to its predators not to devour it. The highly poisonous <b>American</b> <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> have this coloration pattern.

40|$|The protein {{composition}} of the soluble venom from the South <b>American</b> fish-eating <b>coral</b> <b>snake</b> Micrurus surinamensis surinamensis, here abbreviated M. surinamensis, was separated by RP-HPLC and 2 -DE, and their components were analyzed by automatic Edman degradation, MALDI-TOF and ESI-MS/MS. Approximately 100 different molecules were identified. Sixty-two components possess molecular masses between 6 and 8 kDa, are basically charged molecules, among which are cytotoxins and neurotoxins lethal to fish (Brachidanios rerio). Six new toxins (abbreviated Ms 1 -Ms 5 and Ms 11) were fully sequenced. Amino acid sequences similar to the enzymes phospholipase A 2 and amino acid oxidase were identified. Over 20 additional peptides were identified by sequencing minor components of the HPLC separation and from 2 -DE gels. A functional assessment of the physiological activity of the six toxins was also performed by patch clamp using muscular nicotinic acetylcholine receptor assays. Variable degrees of blockade were observed, most of them reversible. The structural and functional data obtained were used for phylogenetic analysis, providing information on some evolutionary aspects of the venom components of this snake.

500|$|The kraits, as {{they are}} {{commonly}} known, belong to the family Elapidae and the genus Bungarus. The genus is endemic to the continent of Asia. They are morphologically well connected, forming a close-knit and cohesive unit. The genus has 12–13 species who are morphologically distinct from the Naja genus and the Afro-elapids according to McDowell (1987). McDowell stated [...] "species diversity is greatest in Africa, but the Asiatic Bungarus and Ophiophagus are each so peculiar in anatomy as to suggest an ancient divergence". Others, including Slowinski, believed that the kraits (Bungarus), {{are part of a}} clade that clusters with a group including the king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) and oddly enough, with the African mambas (Dendroaspis) on the most-parsimonious tree or with Elapsoidea on the maximum-likelihood tree. This result calls into question the monophyly of cobras and underscores the uncertainty of the homology of the hood spreading behavior in cobras and mambas. The relationships of Dendroaspis, Ophiophagus, and Bungarus differed between the parsimony and likelihood analyses, suggesting that more work is necessary to resolve the relationships of these problematic taxa. McDowell's findings in regard to the sister-group of Bungarus and the sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) family, propose that the kraits might just be a per-mutable clade between the elapidae [...] "palatine-erectors" [...] and the hydrophiinae [...] "palatine draggers". Two genera within the hydrophiinae family in particular, support McDowell's hypothesis. The two genera are Salomonelaps and Loveridgelaps due to many shared characteristics. Mao et al. (1983) showed that this species, Bungarus multicinctus was slightly distinct from the other members of its genus and was immunologically more similar to Laticauda, terrestrial Australian elapids, and true sea snakes than it is to Elapsoidea sundevalli (Sundevall's garter snake), Naja naja (Indan cobra) or two Micrurus species (New World or <b>American</b> <b>coral</b> <b>snakes).</b> Minton (1981), Schwaner et al. and Cadle & Gorman (1981) all suggested similar things to Mao et al. (1983) based on immunological data. The many-banded krait was more similar to the Australian elapids, Laticauda and true sea snakes than they were to numerous elapids they were compared to.|$|R
