500|$|Bolton defender Alan Stubbs was {{confident}} Bolton could cause Liverpool problems: [...] "I {{think if you}} look round the team we have got good quality everywhere and that's why we are doing so well, we have also got good players in reserve who <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> do a job. We have played together {{for a long time and}} we are strong both mentally and physically this year. And if the forwards have not been scoring, the midfield and wingers have." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{actor to}} be cast was Renee O'Connor as Dr. Jessica Ryan in December 2006; she filmed her first scenes in February 2007. O'Connor had visited her {{personal}} friend and Boogeymans producer Rob Tapert on the New Zealand set, {{where she had}} had a discussion with him about [...] "the differences of having a supernatural demon versus a real person that <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> be a threat." [...] She concluded the former was scarier. On getting cast in the film and her approach to the character, she stated:I had a contract with Rob Tapert and I just emailed him and said that I really wanted to play this character. I think she would be interesting because it touches back on some of the things I've played as an actress, and that was it. [...] It was so tight in the dialogue, you just have to play with the relationships and find other things going on with the characters to make it seem like there's more depth to what's going on, that there's more of a history between them.|$|E
500|$|Producer Kevin Shirley {{was brought}} in {{on the advice of}} Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry. [...] As Rich explained, [...] "We really wanted to work with someone who <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> say, 'That's not good.'... If Kevin says {{something}} I disagree with, he'll {{be the first one to}} say, 'Hey, it's your song,' but it's healthy for me and Chris to have him come in and be as excited about our songs as we are and say, 'Okay, that's cool, but what if we tried this?'" [...] At his first meeting with the band, Shirley described the songs played for him as having [...] "the same old jammy, shuffle feel of the last two records. [...] I stopped them then and I said to them... 'You've got to feel like you're teenagers again. You need a song like that.'" [...] Shirley's prompting led the band to write [...] "Kickin' My Heart Around" [...] on the spot, before he had signed on to produce. [...] Rich agreed that Shirley shifted the focus to making [...] "a rock record" [...] that was [...] "focused and concise".|$|E

2500|$|Hill {{heard about}} Michael Paré {{from the same}} agent who {{recommended}} Eddie Murphy to him for 48 Hrs (his then-girlfriend and later wife Hildy). At {{the time he was}} cast, in March 1983, Paré had appeared in two films, Eddie and the Cruisers and Undercover, which had not yet been released. For Hill, Paré [...] "had the right quality. He was the only actor I found who was right for the part ...a striking combination of toughness and innocence." [...] Paré said of his character, [...] "He's someone who <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> straighten everything out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gareth Batty {{increased}} his second innings tally to 5 for 87 to dismiss Derbyshire {{early on the}} fourth day, as Stubbings' innings ended with just 10 added to the previous day's score {{for a total of}} 58. By the time they were all out for 285, Derbyshire had set a target of just 71 in 68 overs. It took them only 14 as Peters and Moore won the match for them by 10 wickets. It was an easy victory for Worcestershire in the end, helped by Derbyshire dropping 6 catches along the way. Worcester coach Tom Moody said, [...] "We haven't got our overseas players here but this was {{a good example of the}} depth of our squad. To have a successful season, you need players who <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> stand up and be counted and they've done that. The game proved that catches win matches with Derbyshire dropping six while Worcestershire hardly missed an opportunity. We were let off the hook a bit in the first innings with some dropped chances but our catching was exceptional, particularly with the conditions being so cold. I think the cold weather was the hardest thing for Gareth [...] because it's difficult for a spinner to get his hands warm and grip the ball." ...|$|E

Marriage--the sort of {{marriage}} mine would be--is slavery, and nothing else. What I am afraid of," [...] she went on, [...] "is that when I {{was down in}} that highly respectable old city, sitting all day in a respectable little villa, with two servants to order about and housekeeping-books to keep, I should feel the old pull come over me, and some day I should chuck it all and come back here to play around under the lights. It's rather fine to be here, you know--to be in the atmosphere, even if the lime-light misses one." ...|$|E

Let him have the top room of the tower, which, I am sure, is as pleasant as can be, especially in warm weather, and then he will have his own stairs to himself, and <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> go out just as Mr. Tippengray does, without ever considering whether the Squirrel Inn is open or shut. As for eating, that's a different matter. People can eat in a place without living there. That was all settled when we took Mr. Tippengray." ...|$|E

Yes, sir, it was I who sold Dr. Barnicot his two statues. Disgraceful, sir! A Nihilist plot--that's what I make it. No one but an anarchist would go about {{breaking}} statues. Red republicans--that's what I call 'em. Who did I get the statues from? I don't see what {{that has to do}} with it. Well, if you really want to know, I got them from Gelder & Co., in Church Street, Stepney. They are a well-known house in the trade, and have been this twenty years. How many had I? Three--two and one are three--two of Dr. Barnicot's, and one smashed in broad daylight on my own counter. Do I know that photograph? No, I don't. Yes, I do, though. Why, it's Beppo. He was a kind of Italian piece-work man, who made himself useful in the shop. He could carve a bit, and gild and frame, and do odd jobs. The fellow left me last week, and I've heard nothing of him since. No, I don't know where he came from nor where he went to. I had nothing against him while he was here. He was gone two days before the bust was smashed." ...|$|E
6000|$|When Thumb awoke {{they sat}} quietly mumbling and talking {{together}} a while. Beyond {{the mouth of}} the cavern stood the beehive-houses of the Mountain-mulgars, each in its splash of lengthening shadow. Day drew on to evening. An eagle squalled in space. Else all was still; no living thing stirred. For these Men of the Mountains have no need to keep watch. They sleep secure in their white huts. None <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> none go out but first they must let down their ladders. Thumb scrambled up, and he and Nod hobbled off softly together to where the cataract hung like a shrine of hoarfrost in pillars of green ice from the frozen snows above. The evening was filled with light of the colour of a flower. Even the snow that capped the mountains was faintest violet and rose, and far in the distance, between the peaks of Zut and misty Solmi, stretched a band of darkest purple, above which the risen moon was riding in pale gold. And Nod knew that there, surely, must be Battle's Sea. He pointed Thumb to it, and the two Mulgars stood, legs bandy, teeth shining, eyes fixed. Nod gazed on it bewitched, till it seemed he almost saw the foam of its league-long billows rolling, and could catch in his thin round ear the roar and surge Battle had so often told him of. [...] "Ohé! if my Oomgar were but with me now!" [...] he thought. [...] "How would his eyes stare to see his friend the sea!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a {{considerable}} body of men at work there," [...] he said. [...] "I can hear muffled sounds like digging, and {{once or twice a}} sharp click, as if a spade struck a stone. I am very much afraid they are throwing up a battery there. I was in hopes they would have begun in the open, because we could have commanded the approaches; but if they begin among the trees, they <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out without our seeing them, and bring up their guns by the road without our being able to interfere with them. Mr. Bathurst, will you take down word to Captain Doolan to put his men on the platforms on that side. Tell him that I am going to throw up a rocket, as I believe they are erecting a battery near Hunter's bungalow, and that his men are to be ready to give them a volley if they can make them out. Tell them not to expose themselves too much; for if they really are at work there no doubt they have numbers of men posted in the shrubs all about to keep down our fire. Now, gentlemen, we will all lie down by the parapet. Take those spare rifles, and fire as quickly as you can while the light of the rocket lasts. Now, Mr. Wilson, we will get you to send them up. The rest of you had better get in the corner and stoop down behind the sandbags; you can lay your rifles on them, so as to be able to fire as soon as you have lit the second rocket." ...|$|E
