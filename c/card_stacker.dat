50|$|The {{structures}} created {{using this}} method rely on {{nothing more than}} balance and friction {{in order to stay}} upright. Ideally, adhesives or other external connecting methods are not used, and no damage or alterations are made to the cards themselves. The larger the structure, the higher number of balanced cards that could fail and compromise the integrity of the card building. Professional <b>card</b> <b>stacker</b> Bryan Berg claims, however, that the more cards placed on a tower the stronger it becomes, because the weight of the cards pushing down on the base (increasing friction) allows occasional cards to stumble without the entire structure collapsing. He also claims that proper stacking technique allows cards to function as shear walls, giving considerable stability to the structure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{transistorized}} IBM 129 Card Data Recorder's primary {{advantage over}} other IBM keypunches {{was that it}} featured an electronic 80-column buffer to hold the card image [...] When using earlier IBM keypunches, a keystroke error required the card to be ejected by pressing the Release and Register keys, the error corrected by pressing the Duplicate key until the error column was reached, typing the correct data {{for the rest of}} that card, then pressing the Release key and manually removing the bad card from the output <b>card</b> <b>stacker</b> before it was placed in the deck (this required some practice, but quickly became an automatic action that you no longer had to think about). With the 129, a keystroke error could be erased by pressing the Backspace key and re-keyed. The entire 80-column card was punched automatically, as fast as the mechanism could go, when the Release key was pressed.|$|E
50|$|Information to {{be printed}} {{could be placed}} in any {{sequence}} via plugboard control panel selections. The machine operated {{at the rate of}} 75 cards a minute. The feed hopper had a capacity of 800 <b>cards,</b> and the <b>stacker</b> had a capacity of 1,000 cards.|$|R
50|$|Early Hollerith keypunches were manual devices. Later keypunches were {{electromechanical}} devices which combined several {{functions in}} one unit. These often resembled small desks with keyboards {{similar to those}} on typewriters and were equipped with hoppers for blank <b>cards</b> and <b>stackers</b> for punched <b>cards.</b> Some keypunch models could print, {{at the top of}} a column, the character represented by the hole(s) punched in that column. The small pieces punched out by a keypunch fell into a chad box, or (at IBM) chip box, or bit bucket.|$|R
25|$|A {{keypunch}} is {{a device}} for manually entering data into punched cards by precisely punching holes at locations {{designated by the}} keys struck by the operator. Early keypunches were manual devices. Later keypunches were mechanized, often resembling a small desk, with a keyboard similar to a typewriter, and with hoppers for blank <b>cards</b> and <b>stackers</b> for punched <b>cards.</b> In 1901, Herman Hollerith invented and patented the mechanical key punch that was operated by keys, like a typewriter, and that advanced the card automatically to the next column after each punch. Later models would be motor driven with rudimentary programming features.|$|R
