40|$|<b>Capacitance</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>time</b> (c-t) {{characteristics}} of a MOS structure show the capacitance change after a pulse bias is applied which drives the structure first into accumulation then into deep inversion. Since the time constant of minority carrier generation is relatively long, the MOS structure requires time to reach equilibrium after the pulse bias is applied. Immediately after the pulse bias is applied, the depletion layer extends more widely then the depletion layer becomes narrower - the MOS structure approaches equilibrium {{as more and more}} minority carriers are generated. Finally, the depletion layer reaches its equilibrium width. This proves charge neutrality. The C-t characteristics are obtained from this change in the depletion layer width. During this project, <b>capacitance</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>time</b> measurements were made using an external bias source. The system consists of a probe station located within a dark box, a Keithley K 182 system and a ICS metrics software. The measured capacitance-time (C-t) data were converted into a Zerbst plot using the Zerbst equation. The effective generation lifetime (τg,eff) and the surface generation velocity (seff) were extracted from the slope and the intercept of the Zerbst plot. The main problem with this technique is that times of hundreds or even thousands of seconds per measurement are not uncommon. One method of optical excitation to reduce this measurement time was investigated. We have achieved our goal: setup the pulsed MOS capacitor recombination lifetime measurement technique in the JUT test area. Besides this project did not require the purchase of hardware or additional software. Finally we have shown that the total measurement time was significantly reduced by illumination and there was virtually no error compared to the curve recorded entirely in the dark...|$|E

In addition, the interface state density was measured by the MOS-DLTS technique and the gate oxide integrity was evaluated by constant current stress. Elymat measurements of surface recombination velocity show that surface recombination velocity is increased by organic contamination.

These measurements allowed identifying a band of interface states located around E v+ 0. 1 eV as related to organic contamination. However, the most relevant effects of organic contamination were observed by electrical stress of the oxide.

The dependence of the current vs potential data, {{as well as of the}} open-circuit photovoltage, V_(OC), on E(A/A^−) was compared to the {{behavior of}} H-terminated p-type and n-type Si(111) surfaces in contact with these same electrolytes. For a particular E(A/A^−) value, CH_ 3 -terminated p-Si(111) electrodes showed lower V_(OC) values than Hterminated p-Si(111) electrodes, whereas CH_ 3 -terminated n-Si(111) electrodes showed higher V_(OC) values than H-terminated n-Si(111) electrodes. Under 100 mW cm^(− 2) of ELH-simulated Air Mass 1. 5 illumination, n-type H−Si(111) and CH_ 3 −Si(111) electrodes both demonstrated nonrectifying behavior with no photovoltage at very negative values of E(A/A^−) and produced limiting V_(OC) values of > 0. 5 V at very positive values of E(A/A^−). Illuminated p-type H−Si(111) and CH_ 3 −Si(111) electrodes produced no photovoltage at positive values of E(A/A^−) and produced limiting V_(OC) values in excess of 0. 5 V at very negative values of E(A/A^−).
