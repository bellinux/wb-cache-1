40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Studies of some {{components}} of test weight in Soft White wheat revealed distinct subclass differences. Wheat kernels of Soft White more completely occupied a given volume than did kernels of White Club. The Soft White kernels were larger {{and had a}} higher density than the White Club kernels. Because of their larger size, fewer Soft White kernels were retained in a given volume. Due to their higher percent volume occupancy and their greater kernel density, Soft White wheats had a significantly higher test weight than White <b>Club</b> <b>wheats.</b> Studies with wheats which had been sized by maximum cross - sectional diameter showed that the larger kernels had the highest test weight. They also had a higher percent volume occupancy than smaller kernels. However, {{it was concluded that}} size, per se, was not the reason for the higher percent occupancy. The general shape and condition of the bran coat of large kernels is generally more conducive to close packing than that of smaller kernels. Generally, kernel density did not differ significantly between the larger sizes. The smallest kernels had a lower average test weight, kernel density and occupied less of the volume than the larger kernels. Often the smallest kernels had wrinkled bran coats or distorted contours which may have caused the low packing density. The general shape of White Club kernels is less favorable to close packing than the longer more cylindrical shape of Soft White kernels. Therefore, test weight is a measurement of unequal quantities of wheat when Soft White and White <b>Club</b> <b>wheats</b> are compared...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Winter wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum) were {{evaluated}} for {{their response to}} water stress and adaptability {{to a wide range}} of moisture limited environments. Grain yield was analyzed for ten cultivars at six locations across four years. Regression of the cultivar mean on the year-location mean was used as a measure of the environmental response of a particular cultivar, Plant water status (leaf osmotic potential and water potential) during the grain filling period, along with grain yield and yield components were determined at three locations for fifteen cultivars under space-planted conditions in 1972 and for ten cultivars under solid-seeding in 1973. Five cultivars {{were evaluated}} for plant water status and rates of growth during reproductive development and for final grain yield and yield components at a severely stressed location in 1973. Drought resistance, described as yielding ability under severe soil moisture stress, was found to be the result of avoidance, tolerance and escape characteristics. Plant water status influenced the components of yield when their development occurred during a period of high external stress. However, the relative importance of plant water status to final yield varied depending on the magnitude of the direct effect of spike number on yield. Drought avoidance was the ability to maintain a high plant water status when under high external stress conditions. In the cultivar Yamhill, the stable growth rate during inflorescence development and the extended period of grain filling may have resulted from the ability of this cultivar to avoid drought. These characteristics, also, may explain the large spikelet number and the high kernel weight of Yamhill. Even though Hyslop and Wanser had a moderate and high internal water stress, respectively, they were relatively tolerant of stress in terms of high growth rates during the grain filling period. The high yielding ability of Wanser and McDermid under high stress conditions was primarily related to a large number of spikes. This trait was considered an escape characteristic because tillering was established before the onset of severe stress. The <b>club</b> <b>wheats</b> neither avoided or tolerated internal water stress under solid-seeded conditions nor did they have sufficient tillering capacity to compensate for the effect of stress on the laterdeveloped components. of yield. Nugaines, Hyslop and Rew maintained a moderate internal stress during later development but differed in their yield component responses. The yield of Nugaines depended primarily on a high tillering capacity, whereas the yield of Hyslop and Rew depended on a balance of contributions from all the components of yield. Widely adapted cultivars, such as Hyslop and McDermid, not only yielded well under severe stress conditions but had the genetic potential to respond adequately to more favorable moisture conditions. Cultivars specifically, adapted to lower yielding environments, such as Yamhill and Wanser, were able to avoid, tolerate or escape drought but were limited in one or more of their yield component responses to better conditions. Conversely, cultivars specifically adapted to high yielding environments, such as Nugaines and Paha, lacked the ability to consistently yield well under high stress environments but had a high response to more favorable moisture conditions. Cultivars best adapted to dryland cultivation should have the highest yield under stress conditions as expressed through the components of yield by one or a combination of avoidance, tolerance or escape characteristics. These cultivars should also have the maximum expression in, and balance among, the components of yield for maximum response to more favorable moisture conditions. This goal may be obtained by selection in favorable as well as stressed environments and by testing throughout the range of the environments where the cultivar is expected to be grown. Because high yield under stress was found in this study to be manifested through different characteristics of the plant the breeder should be aware of traits which may contribute to drought resistance, but he should not be restricted to a particular ideotype when breeding for yield under conditions of high moisture stress...|$|R

40|$|In the 1970 s in {{southern}} NSW, Australia, information {{was delivered to}} farmers through the transfer of technology (TOT) model. It was 'top down' with knowledge generated by researchers being passed onto farmers by extension officers. Farmers' knowledge was not respected by research and extension workers. In contrast Cropcheck is a farmer participatory program which benchmarks farmer crops to identify practices for lifting yields. With TOT there was good adoption of single factor technologies such as wheat varieties but by the late 1970 s to early 1980 s wheat yields were stagnant or only slowly improving. There was the realisation that farmers had valuable knowledge and that multiple factors were needed to increase productivity. To address these needs in developing countries many farmer participatory models were developed. This paper, based on my experiences as an extension officer, records development in a developed country of a farmer participatory crop benchmarking model called Cropcheck. This program benchmarks farmer crops to identify the checks (best practices) related to high yields. It {{has been successful in}} lifting crop yields and profitability. This paper discusses the development of the model for irrigated wheat, i. e. the Finley Five Tonne Irrigated <b>Wheat</b> <b>Club</b> (referred to hereafter as "Wheat Club") and adaption of the model for irrigated subterranean clover pasture, i. e. Subcheck. Since farmer participatory extension theory was undeveloped at that time, the development of the model was an intuitive learning process. The process was a planning, action and review cycle. Several years involving crop monitoring, farmer training, crop recording and reviewing results were needed to identify the objective checks consistently improving yields and gross margins. The results showed the more checks adopted the higher the yield and profitability. Farmers were trained in the learning steps of observing, monitoring, measuring, interpreting and recording their own crop practices. Farmer discussion groups were important for communication. Cropcheck has high farmer credibility because the checks are identified from farmer crops. Over a period of 6 Â years, yields of the "Wheat Club" increased by 50 %. With Subcheck the problem of reddened subclover and inconsistent production disappeared. The Cropcheck model has been adapted for many crops in eastern Australia. Precision agriculture and electromagnetic mapping and geographic information systems (GIS) have followed on as new technology and monitoring tools for farmers but it is still important to ground truth these technologies with crop monitoring.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the effects of site potential, season and plant part on percent crude protein, percent digestibility of dry matter and yield of cereal residues. Three cereal types, <b>club</b> <b>wheat</b> (Triticum aestivum) tall, bearded wheat (T. aestivum), and barley Hordeum vulgare) were examined. Stress conditions more than actual site potential produced higher crude protein levels. Stress was usually the result of low soil moisture, though an interaction of soil moisture conditions and fertilization were believed to also be important. When fertilizer treatments were held constant for both high and low potential sites, crude protein levels in all three cereals were higher on the low potential sites. Prior to fall rains, crude protein in the leaves of <b>club</b> <b>wheat</b> and barley on the low potential sites ranged as high as 8 and 9 percent. Club and barley leaves on the high potential sites had only 2. 2 and 3. 4 percent crude protein, respectively. When only the high potential site was fertilized, as in barley in 1978 and bearded wheat in 1977 and 1978, crude protein levels on the high potential site were equal to or greater than those on the low potential site. The effect of season on crude protein levels in leaves and culms was important only when a high initial protein content was observed. Crude protein levels exceeding 6 percent decreased rapidly with the onset of fall precipitation. Crude protein levels were consistently higher in leaves as compared to culms in all cereal types, when averaged across site potentials and sampling dates. Crude protein levels ranged from 1. 2 to 2. 1 percent in culms and 3. 0 to 4. 1 percent in leaves. Percent in vitro dry matter digestibility in leaves, culms and chaff was usually not affected by site potential or plant part. However, season consistently affected the digestibility of leaves and culms. In most cases digestibility decreased over time, with the greatest decrease occurring at the second sampling date. This indicated a rapid loss of soluble carbohydrates once the rains began. Stubble yield was, except in two instances, significantly affected by site potential. Leaf, culm and total (leaves + culms) production was greater on the high potential sites. Yields of standing stubble on high potential sites averaged 700 kg/ha more than on low potential sites. Leaf/culm ratios were consistently higher on the low potential sites. Though not actually sampled, leaf availability was noted to decrease dramatically over the season...|$|E

The shoots of CCC-treated and untreated wheat plants were extracted with ethanol, the plant extract purified, separated by paper chromatography, and subjected to bioassay and color test. A refinement was made in the procedure for purifying plant extracts. Most of the pigments and lipid substances were removed from the alcoholic extract by partitioning with n-hexane. The acidic auxin fraction was further purified using column chromatography with basic alumina, WoeIm alumina, serving as the stationary phase. Direct bioassay of sections of chromatograms by the Avena elongation test revealed a growth promoting region on chromatograms developed in several solvent systems at a R[subscript f] comparable to the R[subscript f] of IAA. A colored spot having the developmental characteristics of IAA appeared on paper chromatograms at the same relative R[subscript f] zone upon spraying with a chromogenic reagent, p-dimethyl-aminocinnamaldehyde (DMAC). These tests provide substantial evidence that IAA is the principal acidic auxin in wheat foliage. Semi-quantitative tests using DMAC indicate that good recovery of IAA is possible using the purification procedure described. A positive color test was obtained on paper chromatograms with the equivalent of 0. 05 micrograms of IAA carried through the procedure. A distinct colored spot was also obtained frorn the extract of a 20 -gram sample of fresh wheat leaves.

A similar experiment was conducted at the Sherman Experiment Station, Moro in Eastern Oregon, using only two winter wheat cultivars, Stephens and Jackmar. Data were obtained on grain yield, tillers and spikes per square meter, heading and anthesis date, plant height, kernels per spike, 1000 kernel weight, test weight and harvest index. At Hyslop Experiment Station, Stephens, Bezostaya and Roussalka produced maximum grain yield at 10 cm row spacing and 160 Kg/ha seeding rate, and Maris-Hobbit at 24 cm row spacing and 160 Kg/ha seeding rate. At Sherman Experiment Station, 30 cm row spacing and 90 Kg/ha seeding rate constitutes the best combination for Stephens, and 30 cm row spacing and 120 Kg/ha seeding rate for the <b>club</b> <b>wheat</b> Jackmar. The interaction between row spacings x cultivars and seeding rates x cultivars indicated that all the cultivars produced high numbers of tillers and spikes per m² at narrow (10 cm) row spacing and high (240 Kg/ha) seeding rate. There were no significant differences between row spacings for heading and anthesis date. Lower seeding rate resulted in later heading date. The cultivar Roussalka was the earliest and Maris-Hobbit the latest in average heading date, Plant height decreased with increased row spacing and increased with increased seeding rate. The plants of the four cultivars were shorter at the second date than at the first. More kernels per spike were produced at the second than at the first date. An increase in seeding rates was accompanied by a decrease in the number of kernels per spike. There were no significant differences between the three row spacings, the three seeding rates and the four cultivars for test weight. The different row spacings and seeding rates did not affect the TOGO kernel weight.

40|$|Thesis (Ph.

Understanding of soft white wheat quality traits affecting SC baking is lacking and in great need of improvement. The objectives of this research were to develop a simple, fast and reliable baking test for predicting flour quality for use on sponge cakes and to identify functional properties of soft white wheat flour important for making acceptable sponge cakes. A simpler and comparably reliable SC baking test procedure was developed by making considerable modifications to the conventional test procedure at the egg foam whipping and batter mixing stages. Foam density, SC volume and crumb grain {{comparable to that of}} the conventional procedure were obtained with modifications, including extension of whipping time without heat input using a 5 -liter KitchenAid® mixer, one time water addition at 3 min before the completion of egg whipping instead of twice, and flour incorporation into the egg foam using a KitchenAid® wire whisk or a Beater Blade®. The modified method of using Beater Blade® or wire whisk for batter mixing exhibited significant correlations in SC volume with the conventional procedure (r= 0. 931, P< 0. 001, r= 0. 925, P< 0. 001, respectively). Significance of flour particle size on SC baking performance was determined using flours of different particle size prepared by re-grinding and sieving. Particle size reduction of flour by re-grinding improved SC volume (0. 8 - 15. 0 %) and crumb grain, with little change in density and viscosity of the flour-water batter despite increases in flour starch damage (0. 1 - 0. 2 %) and sodium carbonate retention capacity (4. 8 - 13. 9 %). Flour fractions of small (< 55 µm) particles produced the largest SC volume, ranging from 1353 - 1450 mL. Even with comparable or higher protein content, flour fraction of intermediate particle size produced larger volume (1040 - 1195 mL) of SC than did flour fractions of large particle size (955 - 1130 mL). The qualitative and quantitative roles of starch on SC baking potential of wheat flour were investigated using flours of various amylose content as well as different quantities and proportions of starch in the baking formula. Normal and single-null partial waxy flours produced SCs ranging from 1093 to 1335 mL in volume, while double-null partial waxy and waxy wheat flours produced SC of 828 to 895 mL. Both amylose content and pasting properties (final viscosity and setback) of wheat flour exhibited significant positive relationships with SC volume. Amylose content of normal and waxy starch blends was significantly related with their SC volume (r= 0. 975, P< 0. 05). Pure wheat starch of over 80 g or more than 75 % starch in 100 g starch-gluten blends in replacement of 100 g wheat flour in the SC baking formula were needed to produce SC having the maximum volume potential.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} differences between winter wheat varieties in response to nitrogen fertilizer. Seven nitrogen fertilizer rate x variety factorial experiments were conducted in several environments. Dry matter and nitrogen yields at boot, soft dough, and harvest and grain yield components were measured. The yield component data were evaluated in terms of storage capacity which is assumed to be proportional to kernels /rn² for a given variety. The kernels /m² was divided into two components, spikes /rn² and kernels/spike. The spikes /m² of each variety were closely related to the boot nitrogen yield, but not to boot dry matter yield or plant nitrogen content. Since the kernels/spike generally remained constant or increased as the boot nitrogen yield increased, the kernels/m² appeared to depend on the boot nitrogen yield. The variety Hyslop had high dry matter and nitrogen yields at boot stage of growth. This appears to allow it to have excellent storage capacity as measured by kernels /m². Good growth by boot stage appears to lower the nitrogen fertilizer rate needed for maximum grain yields. The variety Nugaines had relatively low growth and nitrogen uptake by boot. This may be the reason why it needs a higher fertilizer rate than Hyslop to obtain adequate storage capacity (kernels/m²). However; Nugaines had better growth after soft dough stage. At the dryland locations this may be due to slower depletion of the soil water. At the irrigated locations it may be due to greater late tillering. Hyslop and Nugaines differed in the pattern of yield component adjustment to improving environment. Hyslop mainly increased its average kernels/spike rather than spikes/m². Nugaines had greater increases in spikes/m² but smaller increases in kernels/spike. This may be related to their different cuim sizes and tillering. Hyslop forms a few large culms early in the season, but Nugaines continues to tiller during stem elongation. Coulee was intermediate between Hyslop and Nugaines in patterns of growth over time and pattern of yield component adjustment to improving environment. It had good yields at moderate nitrogen rates, and high nitrogen rates did not appear to be needed for adequate storage capacity. Wanser consistently had low grain yields, which was due to low kernels/m². Nitrogen fertilizer increased its height more than the shorter varieties and this was associated with reductions in kernels/spike: Thus the height growth of Wanser may compete with its ear development and cause poor storage capacity. Wanser had slightly greater grain nitrogen percentage than other varieties, but this was simply associated with its low grain yield. There were only small varietal differences in the percentage of plant nitrogen translocated to grain. However, environment and nitrogen fertilizer rate greatly affected this. The <b>club</b> <b>wheat</b> Paha yielded well but usually less than some other varieties. It had high dry matter and nitrogen yields, but after soft dough its dry matter yields decreased more than for other varieties. This indicated that it depleted soil moisture earlier than other varieties did. Tx 65 A 1268, a short hard red winter wheat with prolific tillering and small culms, was included in. two experiments. It had the highest grain yield at the low rainfall site. This may be related to its early maturity. However, with irrigation it yielded poorly. This appeared to be due to poor storage capacity since there was no increase in kernels/spike with improving environment. Yamhill, an awnletted wheat, yielded well in the Willamette Valley, but not in eastern Oregon. Estimates of the recovery of fertilizer nitrogen were calculated from the increases in soft dough nitrogen yield caused by each increment of nitrogen fertilizer. At sites with excellent moisture supply the first fertilizer increment was incompletely recovered (44 - 66 %), apparently due to immobilization associated with plant residue decay. With higher fertilizer increments which increased yields, fertilizer recovery values were near 100 %. At low rainfall sites under fallow cropping recovery values were 38 - 56 % and decreased with above optimum fertilizer rates. At eastern Oregon sites losses of nitrogen from the plant tops after soft dough ranged from 7 - 33 % depending on variety, location, and fertilizer rate. At maturity the percentage of the total plant top nitrogen in the grain ranged from 60 - 81 %. This percentage decreased with nitrogen fertilization, but was little affected by variety...|$|E
