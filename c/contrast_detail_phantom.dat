We identified a need to examine tablet display performance prior to their use in preliminary interpretation of radiological images. We compared the spatial and contrast resolution of a commercially available tablet display with a diagnostic grade 2 megapixel monochrome LCD using a <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> <b>phantom.</b> We also recorded reporting discrepancies, using the ACR RADPEER system, between preliminary interpretation of 100 emergency CT brain examinations on the tablet display and formal review on a diagnostic LCD. The iPad display performed inferiorly to the diagnostic monochrome display without the ability to zoom. When the software zoom function was enabled on the tablet device, comparable <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> <b>phantom</b> scores of 163 vs 165 points were achieved. No reporting discrepancies were encountered during the interpretation of 43 normal examinations and five cases of acute intracranial hemorrhage. There were seven RADPEER 2 (understandable) misses when using the iPad display and 12 with the diagnostic LCD.

40|$|Dedicated breast {{computed}} tomography (CT) imaging possesses {{the potential for}} improved lesion detection over conventional mammograms, especially for women with dense breasts. The breast CT images are acquired with a glandular dose {{comparable to that of}} standard two-view mammography for a single breast. Due to dose constraints, the reconstructed volume has a non-negligible quantum noise when thin section CT slices are visualized. It is thus desirable to reduce noise in the reconstructed breast volume without loss of spatial resolution. In this study, partial diffusion equation (PDE) based denoising techniques specifically for breast CT were applied at different steps along the reconstruction process and it was found that denoising performed better when applied to the projection data rather than reconstructed data. Simulation results from the <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> <b>phantom</b> show that the PDE technique outperforms Wiener denoising as well as adaptive trimmed mean filter. The PDE technique increases its performance advantage relative to Wiener techniques when the photon fluence is reduced. With the PDE technique, the sensitivity for lesion detection using the <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> <b>phantom</b> drops by less than 7 % when the dose is cut down to 40 % of the two-view mammography. For subjective evaluation, the PDE technique was applied to two human subject breast data sets acquired on a prototype breast CT system.

A nonlinear image diffusion method that incorporates local image parameter, namely, scatterer density in addition to gradient, to weight the nonlinear diffusion process, is proposed. The method was tested for the isotropic case with a <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> <b>phantom</b> and varieties of clinical ultrasound images, and then compared to linear and some other diffusion enhancement methods. Different diffusion parameters were tested and tuned to best reduce speckle noise and preserve edges. The method showed superior performance measured both quantitatively and qualitatively when incorporating scatterer density into the diffusivity function. The proposed filter {{can be used as}} a preprocessing step for ultrasound image enhancement before applying automatic segmentation, automatic volumetric calculations, or 3 D ultrasound volume rendering.

40|$|Although {{mammography}} {{has been}} {{the gold standard for}} the early detection of breast cancer, if a woman has dense breast tissue, a false negative diagnosis may occur. Breast ultrasound, whether hand-held or automated, is a useful adjunct to mammography but adds extra time and cost. The primary aim was to demonstrate that our second-generation Aceso system, which combines full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) in a single platform, is able to produce improved quality images that provide clinically meaningful results. Aceso was first tested using two industry standards: a <b>Contrast</b> <b>Detail</b> Mammography (CDMAM) <b>phantom</b> to assess the FFDM images, and the CIRS 054 GS phantom to evaluate the ABUS images. In addition, 25 women participated in a clinical trial: 14 were healthy volunteers, while 11 were patients referred by the breast clinic at Groote Schuur Hospital. The CDMAM phantom results showed the FFDM results were better than the European Reference (EUREF) standard of “acceptable” and were approaching “achievable”. The ABUS results showed a lateral and axial spatial resolution of 0. 5 mm and an adequate depth penetration of 80 mm.

40|$|The main aim of {{the breast}} {{screening}} programme (BSP) is to provide early detection of breast lesions permitting efficient treatment. At present the BSP is technically run using conventional screen film (S/F) X-ray mammography, which suffers {{from a number of}} inherent limitations. Most of these limitations could be overcome by the use of digital mammography technology. Such a technology has to, however, show image performance that is as good as or better than that for S/F systems. The performance of a digital mammography system can be quantified and compared {{in a number of different}} ways. These include <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) measurements. In practice, various limitations and problems have, however, become apparent in applying these measurements. For the CNR measurements the main problems are the presence of the uncorrected heel effect and the effect of the size of region of interest (ROI). The <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> analysis, using human observers, is time consuming and suffers from the presence of significant inter-observer error. These can be solved by using an "automatic observer". One limitation of using the automated approach is that the relationship between automated and human observer scoring was not fully explored across the wide variety of systems and circumstances encountered in practice. An alternative approach would be to predict <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> response from measurements of modulation transfer function (MTF) and detection quantum efficiency (DQE) using a model of the imaging process. In this thesis, the procedure of measuring CNR was revised and the use of an automatic approach for <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> measurements was further examined, using different modalities of digital mammography. The <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> performance was then analysed across a range of doses for a wide range of clinically used digital mammography systems, using the human results predicted from the automated measurements. MTF and DQE were also measured for the detectors used in these systems. A simple signal-matched noise-integration model was then adopted to theoretically predict the <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> response of these systems. The most remarkable findings of this thesis are as follows: the use of multiple small ROIs led to CNR results that were essentially the same as if a heel effect correction had been applied; the automated measurements can be used to predict the threshold contrast for a typical observer; an encouragingly good level of agreement was found between the experimental <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> data and theoretical predictions. Finally, image performance of promising hybrid pixel semiconductor detectors, not commercially available, was also evaluated with the aid of Monte Carlo simulation, for application to digital mammography...|$|R

Following training, twelve readers consisting of (2 technologists, 4 college students, 4 medical students, and 2 radiology residents) generated a single <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> curve. Eight readers produced approximately linear <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> curves while the remaining four readers required a second order polynomial fit because of reduced performance when detecting the largest (i. e., 12. 5 mm) lesion. For the three smallest lesions, the coefficient of variation between the twelve readers was ~ 12 %, which increases with increasing lesion size to ~ 23 % for 12. 5 mm lesion size. The ratio of the maximum I 92 % to minimum I 92 % values was ~ 1. 6 for the smallest lesions, which increased to a factor of ~ 2. 1 for the 12. 5 mm lesion.

Breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI) is a diagnostic imaging method that uses sestamibi-labelled 99 Tc and a dedicated gamma camera to localize malignant lesions in breast tissue. The aim of this study is to investigate if the current acquisition protocol for BSGI at our hospital is optimized for the detection of lesions in our patients.

40|$|Acoustical {{shadowing}} {{occurring at}} the edges of curved objects {{is one of the most}} frequently observed artifacts in ultrasound imaging. This artifact has been generally ascribed to refraction and reflection effects at the boundary between the curved object and the surrounding tissues. However, the shadowing that would be produced by pure refraction and reflection may not correspond in all circumstances to what is most often seen clinically, i. e., a sharp, discrete shadow projecting down from the edge. We used a tissue-mimicking <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> <b>phantom,</b> speed of sound (SOS) 1477 m/s, containing cylindrically shaped wells to investigate the origin of these shadows. Using solutions of relatively high SOS (20 % ethylene glycol), approximately equivalent SOS (distilled water), and low SOS (70 % isopropyl alcohol), the phantom was scanned with the scanhead face oriented perpendicular to and parallel to the central axes of the cylinders. Shadowing could be produced in both cases when there was a SOS difference between the contents of the cylinders and the phantom. When scanning perpendicular to the cylinders, refraction and reflection effects could have contributed to any shadowing produced, but when the scan planes were oriented parallel to the central axes of the cylinders, neither refraction nor reflection could be occurring to a significant degree. The shadowing produced in these circumstances could be better explained by a phenomenon well known in transmission ultrasonography called phase cancellation. Phase cancellation would produce shadowing independent of scan plane orientation, and could contribute to the shadowing generated in clinical imaging...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the concept of}} filling the air gaps of the conventional <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> <b>phantom</b> (CDP) with various concentrations of contrast media, {{and to develop a}} variable level of attenuation-level differential phantoms that could be more appropriate for contrast measurements in some radiology cases. Methods: Images were acquired using the digital radiography system of the traditional CDP (Perspex/air hole phantom) and the novel form of CDP where the air holes were replaced with attenuating material. In this study, two different attenuating materials were introduced, water and a 30 % concentration of iodine-based contrast medium. Image quality was assessed using automated processing to calculate the image quality factor (IQF) inv. Results and Discussion: Phantom studies indicate that lower contrast levels are obtained when CDP holes are filled with water and a 30 % concentration of iodine contrast media than those observed for air/Perspex or traditional CDP. As an example, when a 5 -mAs beam is used the IQFinv values are 5. 32 in the case of air filling the holes; however, when these holes are filled with water under the same conditions, the value of the IQFinv drops to 2. 55, and to 2. 83 when 30 % of contrast media is used. Other concentrations were also tested. These results indicate {{that it is possible to}} extend the contrast scale in these phantoms to include ranges that are more realistic for a patient&# 039;s body than just air and tissue-equivalent material. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the proposed extension of the contrast scales allows smaller changes in contrast to be discerned. This is due to the small attenuation differences of the subject materials (e. g, 30 % contrast liquid and wax) from the traditional form of CDP (material/air). This suggests that the low form of the CDP may have a useful role in assessing image quality in planar radiology as an evaluation tool to better represent low-subject contrast imaging requirem...|$|E

Kodak EDR 2 film was characterised across the range of exposure conditions used in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Its dose-response curve was modelled using a novel equation, and overall uncertainty in film response was estimated. The film saturated at 1 Gy, limiting its usefulness for skin dosimetry. Its performance was found to be strongly dependent on beam filtration, an aspect that had not previously been studied. The film was then used to measure skin doses to patients undergoing coronary angiograms and angioplasties. For angiograms, all skin doses were well below 1 Gy. For angioplasties, 23 % of films showed localised saturation, indicating peak skin doses of at least 1 Gy. Dose-area-product was shown to be a poor predictor of high peak skin dose. A mathematical model was developed and software written, to calculate patient skin dose maps from exposure and projection data stored in the image files. This offered a practical method for assessing the magnitude and approximate location of the peak skin dose. Accuracy was limited by a lack of information regarding fluoroscopic exposures, couch position and beam limitation. After including an estimated contribution from fluoroscopy, the model successfully identified those patients whose skin doses exceeded 1 Gy. Following a baseline survey of local barium enema practice, several dose reduction methods were considered. It was decided to introduce copper filtration. 0. 1 mm copper reduced mean patient DAP by 37 %, without any measurable difference in <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> detectability.

40|$|All {{radiographic}} imaging modalities are imperfect; {{they produce}} {{images that are}} affected to some degree by loss of object information or details. This can be addressed by exposing the subject being imaged to beams of different exposure values or extending the exposure time, but this result {{in an increase in}} the radiation dose delivered to the subject, a factor which must be minimised in clinical applications. In order for radiographic imaging modalities to be calibrated to minimise the dose delivered to a patient while still capturing images of sufficient detail to facilitate diagnosis, various methods of image quality (IQ) assessment have been developed which determine the efficiency and low contrast detectability of these modalities. A further approach to the reduction of the dose delivered is applied in the latest types of Computed Tomography (CT) modalities, in which incomplete slices are obtained and utilised in the reconstruction of images. These slices are made through very short periods of time which also reduces the dose to the patient but leads to some artefacts in the image in addition to some extra information loss. IQ assessment is therefore critical to these new types of CT modalities as well [1]. Assessing IQ is normally either done by using equipment (objective method) or by visualisation of images by professionals (subjective method) [more information about different methods of image quality evaluation is discussed in (Chapter 2, Section 2. 8) ]. Objective assessments of image quality associated with diagnostic imaging systems are most often equipment-based, such as noise analysis or modulation transfer functions [2]. These methods do not consider the effects of the image assessor, who is typically a radiologist, nor the effects of the viewing system and conditions. Image quality can also be assessed subjectively. The subjective method is based on the observer&rsquo;s perception of the assessor. This method requires multiple observers who individually identify a visible object (threshold details) for every detailed parameter available in the image. The human decision criteria are considered a fundamental element, as they can be included in the imaging chain when evaluating image quality, due to their crucial role in the medical diagnosis process. In this method, the radiologists usually assess the diagnostic images with the receiver operator characteristics (ROCs) to compare the performance of different imaging systems [more details about the ROC in (Chapter 2, Section 2. 8. 3) ]. Despite the fact that ROC analysis considers the whole imaging chain, such as human observers and equipment, this analysis is a time-consuming process and cannot be readably adopted as a quality assurance (QA) method in a busy clinical practice [3]. The most common alternative approach to assess IQ is the use of a <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> <b>phantom</b> (CDP). A CDP can provide useful information on contrast detail detectability and is considered the most reliable form of IQ assessment, particularly in low-contrast conditions [3]. In fact, the CDP is referred to as a low-contrast detail (LCD) phantom, and the commercially available phantom is called CDRAD 2. 0. The CDRAD phantom is made of acrylic (Perspex; polymethyl methacrylate) which is 10 mm thick and in which 225 cylindrical holes of various sizes and depths are drilled. The diameter of the holes varies in size from 0. 3 mm to 8 mm. This range is equally distributed across 15 depths. These depths range from 8 mm (providing high contrast) to 0. 3 mm (providing low contrast). Hence, the CDRAD phantom uses the air&ndash;acrylic interface to create image contrast [3]. This method involves both equipment and observers. This thesis is mainly focused on the use of CDPs in the evaluation of IQ in two X-ray-based modalities: Conventional radiography and CT. The evaluation of the former modality includes computed radiography (CR) and digital radiography (DR) systems. A modified CDRAD phantom which is based on the CDP approach is proposed and evaluated. This modified phantom utilises a smaller attenuation differential than unmodified CDRAD and it is more closely representative of the tissues found in the human body. The three main aims of this thesis are then as follows: The first aim: To modify the current CDRAD phantom by replacing the air-filled holes fully with water or contrast media. Replacing the air-filled holes at the same phantom with the contrast media can create a gradation of contrast measurements that can be varied and extended by adding different amounts (concentrations) of contrast media into the holes (Chapter 5) because air attenuates much less radiation compared with other media, including Perspex. After creating a low contrast phantom by replacing the air-filled holes with water at the CDRAD, the LCD of these two interfaces (air-Perspex and water-Perspex) is investigated by utilising of information loss (IL) theory in the DR system (Chapter 6). The investigation of applying the IL theory with the CDRAD is extended to include the evaluation of the image quality of the CR system using two different techniques anti-scatter grid and non-grid on the unmodified CDRAD containing air filled holes (Chapter 7). Finally, the study of the grid effect includes the flat panel direct (DR) system by using the IQFinv factor to assess the image quality of different DR systems with and without the grid by using the CDRAD phantom containing air-filled holes (Chapter 8). The second aim: To create a special contrast-detail phantom to evaluate the IQ and assess the LCD of CT scanners more efficiently than the commercially available Catphan phantoms by including a wide dynamic range that can be modified to assess any required level of LCD, which will be called CTCDP. Like the CDRAD phantom used in conventional radiography, the CTCDP incorporates a central slide that contains holes of different diameters. The diameter of these holes incrementally increases in size {{from the middle of the}} phantom to the phantom edge, as follows: 1. 0 mm, 2. 5 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 7. 5 mm, 9. 0 mm, 10. 0 mm, 11. 0 mm and 12. 5 mm (more details about the CTCDP in Chapter 9). The detection of the LCD at this phantom is measured by two factors: IQF and IL (Chapters 9 and 10). This phantom complements the existing Catphan and extends its applicability to much lower contrast values and also it extends its contrast dynamic scale. The third aim: To investigate the effects of the contrast media on the CTDI value and relate it to the CT numbers by using theoretical and experimental methods. The theoretical method employed a new derivation of the known CTDI formula. This new derivation accounts for the presence of the contrast media as a factor when determining the dose enhancement. The experimental part includes the determination of the dose enhancement by using the contrast media and Gafchromic films (Chapter 11). These studies will be of great value to the radiology community and to all the CT users because it develops a method of estimating the level of information loss during imaging procedures that significantly enhances the X-rays based modalities currently employed...|$|E

Following on from proof of concept simulation studies, this research considers the motion evaluation and stiffness reconstruction of a soft tissue approximating gelatine phantom. This initial phantom work provides an intermediate stage between prior simulation studies more <b>detailed</b> <b>phantom</b> studies to follow. Reference points {{on the surface of}} a cylindrical phantom were successfully tracked and converted into a steady-state motion description. Motion error based mechanical property reconstruction allowed an estimation of the stiffness of the gelatine when actuated at 50 Hz. The reconstructed stiffness compared favorably with independently measured stiffness properties of the gelatine material when experimental assumptions were considered. An experimental noise estimate of 50 % was confirmed accurate by comparing experimental motions to simulated motion data with added noise...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{iterative}} algorithms in tomographic reconstruction always {{leads to}} a frequency adapted rate of convergence in that low frequencies are accurately reconstructed after a few iterations, while high frequencies sometimes require many more computations. In this paper, we propose to build frequency adapted (FA) algorithms based on a condition of incomplete backprojection and propose an FA simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (FA-SART) algorithm as an example. The results obtained with the FA-SART algorithm demonstrate a very fast convergence on a highly <b>detailed</b> <b>phantom</b> {{when compared to the}} original SART algorithm. Though the use of such an FA algorithm may seem difficult, we specify in which case it is relevant and propose several ways to improve the reconstruction process with FA algorithms.

40|$|Mammography is a {{challenging}} field of medical imaging. Early detection {{of breast cancer}} requires identifying small <b>contrast</b> <b>details.</b> The choice of the appropriate monochromatic energy enhances the visibility of such details. Thomson scattering source can provide tunable quasi-monochromatic X-ray beams. In this work, we investigate by Monte Carlo simulations the optimal monochromatic energy to image mammographic phantoms. In order to mimic a Thomson scattering source, we consider the effect on image quality {{of the presence of}} an energy spread and of the presence of higher-order harmonics...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} work is to analyze the {{potential}} of the cross-correlation component of the multiscale structural similarity metric (R*) to predict human performance in detail detection tasks closely related with diagnostic x-ray images. To check the effectiveness of R, the authors have initially applied this metric to a <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> detection task. Methods: Threshold contrast visibility using the R* metric was determined for two sets of images of a contrast-detail phantom (CDMAM). Results from R and human observers were compared as far as the contrast threshold was concerned. A comparison between the R* metric and two algorithms currently used to evaluate CDMAM images was also performed. Results: Similar trends for the CDMAM detection task of human observers and R* were found in this study. Threshold contrast visibility values using R* are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained by human observers (F-test statistics: p > 0. 05). Conclusions: These results using R* show that it could be used to mimic human observers for certain tasks, such as the determination of <b>contrast</b> <b>detail</b> curves in the presence of uniform random noise backgrounds. The R* metric could also outperform other metrics and algorithms currently used to evaluate CDMAM images and can automate this evaluation task...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{developed}} a method to handle the image quality test-tool precisely. This test-tool is important to evaluate {{the quality of the}} medical images for pre-treatment planning phase. But the achieved images are estimated by naked eyes, which does not provide the precise result. Our main goal is to get the desired image parameters numerically. This numerical estimation overcomes the limitation of naked eye observation. Hence, it enhances the pre-treatment planning. The ETR- 1 test-tool is considered here.
