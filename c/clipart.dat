40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} method to create vector <b>cliparts</b> from photographs. Our {{approach}} aims at reproducing two key properties of cliparts: they should be easily editable, and they should represent image content in a clean, simplified way. We observe that vector artists satisfy both of these properties by modeling <b>cliparts</b> with linear color gradients, which have {{a small number of}} parameters and approximate well smooth color variations. In addition, skilled artists produce intricate yet editable artworks by stacking multiple gradients using opaque and semi-transparent layers. Motivated by these observations, our goal is to decompose a bitmap photograph into a stack of layers, each layer containing a vector path filled with a linear color gradient. We cast this problem as an optimization that jointly assigns each pixel to one or more layer and finds the gradient parameters of each layer that best reproduce the input. Since a trivial solution would consist in assigning each pixel to a different, opaque layer, we complement our objective with a simplicity term that favors decompositions made of few, semi-transparent layers. However, this formulation results in a complex combinatorial problem combining discrete unknowns (the pixel assignments) and continuous unknowns (the layer parameters). We propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm that efficiently explores this solution space by leveraging layering cues at image junctions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by reverse-engineering existing <b>cliparts</b> and by creating original <b>cliparts</b> from studio photographs...|$|R

The large clip art libraries produced by Dover Publications or the University of South Florida's <b>Clipart</b> ETC project are based on public domain images, but {{because they have been}} scanned and edited by hand, they are now derivative works and copyrighted, subject to very specific usage policies. In order for a clip art image based on a public domain source to be truly in the public domain, the proper rights must be granted by the individual or organization which digitized and edited the original source of the image.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} stages of the Openclipart project, a website was created that lacked {{thumbnails}} and was hard to browse. To help propagate the images in the library, downloadable Openclipart packages were released. These packages were available directly from the Openclipart website, or as an add-on for various Linux distributions including Fedora, or an NSIS installer for Windows. Each package included most of the <b>clipart</b> to date and were manually sorted into categories, a laborious process. The Openclipart package version 0.20 was released in 2010. The Openclipart packages received only a few more incremental updates during 2010, mostly for seasonal <b>clipart.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Openclipart library, {{sometimes}} abbreviated as OCAL (Open Clip Art Library), {{was started}} in early 2004 by Jon Phillips and Bryce Harrington, developers for vector graphics software Sodipodi, and later its fork, Inkscape. Openclipart initially {{grew out of a}} project started by Christian Schaller (Uraeus), who on October 26, 2003 issued a challenge on the Gnome Desktop website for users of Sodipodi to create a collection of flags in SVG format. The flag project progressed very well, resulting in a collection of over 90 flags made publicly available in SVG format, which lead to a broadening of the project goals to include generic <b>clipart.</b> The project became known as Openclipart by April 2004, with the stated aim of all contributed images being dedicated to the public domain.|$|E
50|$|The {{travelling}} gnome {{has appeared}} in several video games.

In the video game, Half-Life 2: Episode Two (2007), players receive a special achievement award for launching a garden gnome into outer space in a rocket after carrying it throughout most of the game. Gnonstop Gnomes, a mobile app for Android and iOS devices, lets users attach <b>clipart</b> of virtual gnomes to their travel photographs that they can share with friends.|$|E
