50|$|The {{interviews}} {{depict the}} individual differences {{from one person}} to the other, but also show certain <b>communalities</b> and demonstrate the strong will and preparedness to struggle to fulfill dreams and participate in the fight for the improvement of conditions for visually impaired persons nationally and internationally.|$|E
50|$|Large {{values of}} the <b>communalities</b> will {{indicate}} that the fitting hyperplane is rather accurately reproducing the correlation matrix. It {{should be noted that}} the mean {{values of the}} factors must also be constrained to be zero, from which it follows that the mean values of the errors will also be zero.|$|E
50|$|Communality: The {{sum of the}} squared factor {{loadings}} for all factors for a given variable (row) is the variance in that variable accounted for by all the factors, and {{this is called the}} <b>communality.</b> The <b>communality</b> measures the percent of variance in a given variable explained by all the factors jointly and may be interpreted as the reliability of the indicator.|$|R
50|$|Uniqueness of a variable: That is, {{uniqueness}} is {{the variability}} of a variable minus its <b>communality.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} three variable deletion {{strategies in}} canonical correlation analysis. All three strategies are illustrated by examples. The first strategy uses the canonical <b>communality</b> (h 2) coefficients {{of the three}} functions to decide which variable to delete. The second function also uses the canonical <b>communality</b> coefficients, but only after deleting the least contributing function. The third strategy used weighted canonical <b>communality</b> coefficients on all three functions to decide which variable to delete. All three strategies attempt to provide the researcher with a more parsimonious canonical solution. (Contains 11 tables and 4 references.)

5000|$|Factor {{analysis}} {{depends on}} measuring distances between observations : {{the choice of}} a significant metric is crucial. The Euclidean metric (Principal Component Analysis), the Chi-Square distance (Correspondence Analysis) or the Generalized Mahalanobis distance (Discriminant Analysis [...] ) are among the more widely used. More complicated models, using <b>communalities</b> or rotations have been proposed.|$|E
50|$|This is {{equivalent}} to minimizing the off-diagonal components of the error covariance which, in the model equations have expected values of zero. This is to be contrasted with principal component analysis which seeks to minimize the mean square error of all residuals. Before the advent of high speed computers, considerable effort was devoted to finding approximate solutions to the problem, particularly in estimating the <b>communalities</b> by other means, which then simplifies the problem considerably by yielding a known reduced correlation matrix. This was then used to estimate the factors and the loadings. With the advent of high-speed computers, the minimization problem can be solved iteratively with adequate speed, and the <b>communalities</b> are calculated in the process, rather than being needed beforehand. The MinRes algorithm is particularly suited to this problem, but is hardly the only iterative means of finding a solution.|$|E
5000|$|PCA and factor {{analysis}} can produce similar results. This point is also addressed by Fabrigar et al.; in certain cases, whereby the <b>communalities</b> are low (e.g., [...]40), the two techniques produce divergent results. In fact, Fabrigar et al. {{argue that in}} cases where the data correspond to assumptions of the common factor model, the results of PCA are inaccurate results.|$|E

"In PCA, 1.00s {{are put in}} the {{diagonal}} meaning {{that all of the}} variance in the matrix is to be accounted for (including variance unique to each variable, variance common among variables, and error variance).

In contrast, in EFA, the <b>communalities</b> are put in {{the diagonal}} meaning that only the variance shared with other variables is to be accounted for (excluding variance unique to each variable and error variance).

40|$|AbstractThe <b>communality</b> {{problem in}} factor {{analysis}} {{is that of}} reducing the diagonal elements of a correlation matrix so that the resulting matrix will be positive semidefinite and of minimum rank. The problem is well studied, but no effective solution procedures have been devised. In this paper, we propose a variant problem and give an algorithm for its solution. We prove that {{a solution to this}} problem also solves the <b>communality</b> problem if the correlation matrix is Stieltjes...|$|R
50|$|In education, the Hawke Government {{sought to}} {{significantly}} widen {{educational opportunities for}} all Australians. Increased funds were made available for most schools, while both TAFE and higher education were expanded. Measures were taken to improve educational opportunities for Aborigines, {{as demonstrated by the}} government providing funding of almost $100 million from 1984 to 1992 for parental education, student support and tutorial assistance through its Aboriginal Education Direct Assistance Program. In addition, an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Capital Grants Program was established to construct and renovate school buildings in remote area <b>communalities.</b> Government expenditure on education under Hawke also rose significantly. On a per-student basis, the increase in Commonwealth funding amounted to 136% for government schools and 71% for non-government schools. A Participation and Equity Program was also established which provided around $250 million mainly to schools with low retention to the end of secondary education from 1983 to 1987.|$|E

The other 19 participants agreed {{to stick with the}} Paris agreement, to view it as irreversible and to swiftly put it into practice. After the summit finished, the Turkish president, Erdoğan said his country would not ratify the Paris agreement; Turkey was no industrialized nation but a developing country like other neighboring countries of the region and that François Hollande as then President had assured international assistance funds. President Macron has now invited members for further negotiations at another climate summit in Paris on 12 December. In spite of the United States' dissent, the German presidency wanted {{to make the most of}} the [...] "renewed public policy interest for environmental sustainability, gender equity and social inclusiveness, in the spirit of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)" [...] - notably by promoting renewable energy and further fossil fuel divestment in all nations.|$|E

The percentage of students in secondary education rose substantially, from 35% in 1982 to 77% in 1992, {{partly as a result of}} greater financial assistance to students from low-income backgrounds.|$|E
40|$|The current project {{examined}} {{the effect of}} science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) role model gender and <b>communality</b> and communal goal endorsement on college women’s math performance and their interest in, perceived belonging in, and perceived communal goal affordance of STEM. The first study was conducted online and did not include math performance, while the second {{study was conducted in}} the laboratory and added a math assessment. It was hypothesized that exposure to a female role model would result in greater math performance and interest and perceiving belonging in STEM, exposure to a communal role model would result in increased interest in, perceived belonging in, and perceived communal goal affordance of STEM fields, and gender and <b>communality</b> would interact such that gender would only make a difference for communal role models. In addition, it was hypothesized that the effects of role model <b>communality</b> would be greater for participants with higher communal goal endorsement. The hypotheses were not supported. There was no effect of role model <b>communality,</b> and effects of role model gender were not consistent across the two studies. Contrary to predictions, communal goal endorsement was positively related to interest and perceiving belonging in STEM in both studies...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the factor}} {{analysis}} of three consecutive censuses, four determinants of changes in agriculture and rural areas in the Piła sub-region have been identified and the communality has been determined. The first determinant is production constraints of agricultural holdings due to resource conditions in the Piła sub-region (destimulant). This factor was responsible for 30. 43 % of the <b>communality</b> throughout the period under study. The second factor is {{the economic and social}} activity in the rural areas in the Piła sub-region (development stimulant) and it explained 15. 47 % of the <b>communality.</b> The third factor is human capital on the labour market in municipalities in the Piła sub-region. It was responsible for 13. 25 % of the <b>communality.</b> The last of the factors is the development of road and social infrastructure in municipalities in the Piła sub-region and it explained  9. 15 % of the <b>communality.</b> These factors were induced by natural conditions, farm production constraints, the level of entrepreneurship, the situation on the labour market, which contributed to the development of sub-urbanization and the development of road and social infrastructure, as well as their derivatives, such as income levels, development of the building industry and early school education. Agriculture destimulated the development of municipalities in the Piła sub-region during the period under study...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{disentangle}} {{the impact}} of multiple transmission channels in interbank connectedness. We use the identification properties of a structural vector autoregression with a multivariate GARCH-in-mean structure (SVAR-MGARCH-M) to model the dynamics in equity returns of the Eurozone systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). We can identify the impacts of multiple transmission channels such as asset <b>communality,</b> interbank deposits, and information contagion. Asset <b>communality</b> is both {{a factor in the}} transmission of shocks and a means of diversification: heightened connectedness results in an increase in shock spillovers, which are countered by risk sharing benefits. We show that connectedness increased during the financial crisis with a major role for common exposures. Institutions move from being a net recipient to a net transmitter of shocks when the asset <b>communality</b> channel is taken into account, suggesting that we need to evaluate the systemic importance of an institution using all transmission components...|$|R
40|$|The varimax rotation, {{a special}} case of the orthomax method, usually {{contains}} the process of normalization by the <b>communalities</b> of manifest variables. After rotation, factor loadings are re-scaled so that the <b>communalities</b> have original values. Although the standard errors of rotated factor-loadings have been discussed from the general view point of estimation of parameters with restrictions, the actual standard errors for normalized rotation have not been provided. In this paper a method of estimating the asymptotic sandard errors in the normalized orthomax rotation is given. Two artificial examples are provided in which standard errors become extremely large with or without normalization...|$|E
40|$|A lot of {{different}} composition mechanisms claim to permit aspect-oriented software development because {{they are able to}} handle the problem of tangled code which was the original target of aspect-oriented programming (AOP). However, it becomes hard to compare those different approaches, because they usually focus on different kinds of tangled code. For comparing different approaches it is necessary to find some <b>communalities</b> between tangled code. Such <b>communalities</b> can be used to classify tangled code and in that way the impact of new aspect-oriented approaches can be determined in respect to what classes of tangled code they are able to handle. A general purpose aspectoriented approach should be able to handle all kinds of tangled code...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive {{control is}} an {{important}} mental ability that is examined using a multitude of cognitive control tasks and effects. The present paper presents the first steps in the elaboration of a functional approach, which aims to uncover the <b>communalities</b> and differences between different cognitive control tasks and their effects. Based {{on the idea that}} responses in cognitive control tasks qualify as operant behaviour, we propose to reinterpret cognitive control tasks in terms of operant contingencies and cognitive control effects as instances of moderated stimulus control. We illustrate how our approach can be used to uncover <b>communalities</b> between topographically different cognitive control tasks and can lead to novel questions about the processes underlying cognitive control...|$|E

30|$|Assuming {{that all}} of the six {{sections}} in the two tests are measuring a single construct, a question one could ask is, in order to assess learners’ English proficiency, do receptive skills and productive skills need to be measured separately?

JC speaking had the lowest <b>communality,</b> but still, it was over a half (0.52).
