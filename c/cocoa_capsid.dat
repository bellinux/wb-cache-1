To find out the side effect of application of P. fumosoroseuson black ant, Dolichoderus thoracicus, a series of observations were carried out at the Laboratory of Pest and Diseases Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute (ICCRI) and in a cocoa plantation of Glenmore, Banyuwangi district, since June until October, 2004. Laboratory research used four concentrations of P. fumosoroseusnamely 105, 106, 107 and 108 spores/ml, while in the field used concentration 2, 4, 6, 8 g dry spores/ml. Each trial as compared with spraying of carbamate and synthetic pyrethroid insecticides as control and untreated This research was designed by randomized block design and four replications. The results showed that in the laboratory, direct spraying suspension of P. fumosoroseuskilled black ant between 20 — 39 % which infected fungi about 2. 5 — 12. 5 %. The relationship between log of spores concentration of P. fumosoroseus and probit of ant mortality followed the regression equation Y = 3. 653 + 0. 097 X with LC 50 was 8 x 10 13 spore/ml. The period needed to kill a half of ant population at the laboratory (LT 50) at concentration 107 spores/ml followed the regression equation Y = 1. 851 + 1. 522 X, with LT 50 is 12, 01 days. The effect of pyrethroid and carbamate insecticide on ants mortality were 91. 25 % and 98. 75 % respectively. In the field, the effect of P. fumosoroseusspray on black ant population was very low, with the percentage of ant mortality at cocoa leaf nest were 0. 25 – 0. 46 % and at cocoa leaf nest in plastic bag were 0. 06 – 0. 21 %, while carbamate and pyrethroid synthetic effect were 37. 35 % and 52. 37 % at cocoa leaf nest, and 19. 15 % and 46. 67 % at cocoa leaf nest in plastic bags.

40|$|Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) is an {{important}} foreign exchange earner for Ghana. However, production is constrained by {{a high incidence of}} pests and diseases. Based on farmers' needs, this study focused on the control of capsids, mainly Sahlbergella singularis Haglund and Distantiella theobroma (Distant) (both Hemiptera: Miridae). Annual crop loss caused by capsids is estimated at 25 ¿ 30 %. To control capsids, formal research recommends application of synthetic insecticides four times between August and December. However, farmers hardly adopt this recommendation, which they consider unsuitable for their conditions and context. Three alternative control methods were tested with farmers: mass trapping, using sex pheromones; applying crude aqueous neem Azadirachta indica A. Juss. (Meliaceae) seed extract (ANSE) and using the predatory ant Oecophylla longinoda Latreille (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) as a biological control agent. Contrary to most previous reports, studies on temporal distribution of <b>cocoa</b> <b>capsids</b> indicated that the population peaked in March. ANSE was effective against <b>capsids</b> and other <b>cocoa</b> insect pests and did not affect the predatory ant. When O. longinoda occurred in high numbers, capsid incidence was low. Shade did not influence ant or capsid abundance significantly. ANSE caused 100 % mortality of capsids in cage and 79 ¿ 88 % in field experiments. The sex pheromone was as effective as ANSE or ants in suppressing capsids. All the three methods were effective and compatible; hence, they can be used in an integrated pest management strategy for cocoa, including organic production in Ghana...|$|R
