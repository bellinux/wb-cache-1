The relationship <b>of</b> the <b>clauses</b> in a sentence is especially important concerning complex sentences, in which the <b>clauses</b> are not <b>of</b> the same level but show a dependency. So, precisely the adverbial <b>clauses</b> <b>of</b> time {{are the ones that are}} highly complicated and create confusion. For this reason, most of the people try to avoid them, and use simple clauses instead, nevertheless, this somehow loses the meaning and originality of the idea. This means that although complex, adverbial <b>clauses</b> <b>of</b> time are crucial in explaining our ideas and thoughts.
