5|$|By {{calling a}} federal referendum, {{a group of}} {{citizens}} may challenge a law passed by parliament, if they gather 50,000 signatures against the law within 100 days. If so, a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by a simple majority whether to accept or reject the law. Any 8 cantons together can also call a <b>constitutional</b> <b>referendum</b> on a federal law.|$|E
5|$|Pérez Balladares' {{term was}} notable for free-market reforms and the {{privatization}} of government services. He also rehabilitated a number of officials from the Noriega years and sought a closer alliance with the United States than the previous administration of Guillermo Endara. Following a failed <b>constitutional</b> <b>referendum</b> to allow him a second term in office, Pérez Balladares was succeeded by Moscoso in 1999.|$|E

5|$|A <b>constitutional</b> <b>referendum</b> {{was held}} in Puerto Rico on 19 August 2012.

Despite support from the party in government and part of the main opposition party, both amendments were rejected by voters.|$|E

In 2017 Freedom House rated Turkey at 38 (on a 0–100 scale) as Partly Free. The <b>constitutional</b> <b>referendum</b> {{was held}} in April 2017 to change the parliamentary system to a presidential system. Many elements in this constitutional reform package have increased concerns in Europe regarding democracy and separation of powers. The referendum ended in favor of change.|$|E
5|$|Until the {{legalisation}} {{of opposition}} parties in 1992, Déby's MPS {{was the sole}} legal party in Chad. Since then, 78 registered political parties have become active. In 2005, opposition parties and human rights organisations supported the boycott of the <b>constitutional</b> <b>referendum</b> that allowed Déby to stand for re-election for a third term amid reports of widespread irregularities in voter registration and government censorship of independent media outlets during the campaign. Correspondents judged the 2006 presidential elections a mere formality, as the opposition deemed the polls a farce and boycotted them.|$|E

5|$|After {{voting in}} favor of the Franco-African Community <b>constitutional</b> <b>referendum</b> of 28 September 1958, Gabon became pseudo-politically independent. Legislative {{elections}} were scheduled for 19 June 1960 through the Scrutin de Liste voting system, a form of bloc voting in which each party offers a list of candidates who the population vote for; the list that obtains a majority of votes is declared the winner and wins all the contested seats. Through the redistricting of district and constituency boundaries, the BDG arbitrarily received 244 seats, while the UDSG received 77. In the months that followed, the legislative majority was plagued by internal strife. M'ba, now President of Gabon, decided to dissolve the Assembly and looked to the opposition to strengthen his position.|$|E
5|$|Fisher wanted {{additional}} Commonwealth {{power in}} certain areas, {{such as the}} nationalisation of monopolies. A <b>constitutional</b> <b>referendum</b> was initiated in 1911 which aimed to increase the federal government's legislative powers over trade and commerce and over monopolies. Both questions were defeated, with around 61 per cent voting 'No'. The Fisher government made another attempt, holding a referendum in 1913 which asked for greater federal powers over trade and commerce, corporations, industrial matters, trusts, monopolies, and railway disputes. All six questions were defeated, with around 51 per cent voting 'No'. At the 1913 election, the Commonwealth Liberal Party, led by Joseph Cook, defeated the Labor Party by a single seat.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the passage}} of the Loi Cadre by the French National Assembly in 1956, many of the colonies in French West African began to hold {{elections}} to increase the self-determination of their territories. In the first elections held in French Sudan in 1957, the African Democratic Rally (Rassemblement Démocratique Africain, commonly known as the RDA) won the elections in French Sudan, as well as winning majorities in neighboring Ivory Coast, French Guinea, and the Upper Volta. Following the French <b>constitutional</b> <b>referendum</b> of 1958, of which received an overwhelming majority in support, the République Soudanaise declared itself a republic with internal autonomy on 24 November 1958. The Sudanese Republic, as the area was now called, was the second colony after Madagascar to join the French Community, which provided it internal autonomy while linking its currency, foreign policy and defense with France.|$|E
50|$|During {{the colonial}} era, voters participated in French <b>constitutional</b> <b>{{referendum}}s</b> in 1945, May 1946, October 1946 and 1958. Unlike in other French territories, voting in the 1958 referendum {{was restricted to}} French citizens only.|$|R

50|$|Chapter VIII of the Constitution of Australia {{provides}} the method for altering the Constitution. It contains only one section, section 128, which sets out {{the requirements for}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>referendums</b> by which {{the words of the}} Constitution may be altered.|$|R
5|$|After {{being pushed}} back repeatedly, a <b>constitutional</b> <b>referendum</b> {{was held on}} 17 November 2010 that {{resulted}} in adoption of the state's fourth constitution with 73% in favor and a voter turnout of 52.6%. The independent Malagasy political watchdog group KMF-CNOE, {{as well as the}} political opposition and the international community, cited numerous irregularities in the process, which was carried out unilaterally by the HAT. The constitution in effect at the time Rajoelina took office required that presidential candidates attain a minimum of 40 years of age. One substantive change made by the new constitution was to lower the minimum age for presidential candidates from 40 to 35, making Rajoelina eligible to stand in presidential elections. In addition, the new constitution mandated the leader of the High Transitional Authority – the position held by Rajoelina – be kept as interim president until an election could take place. The new constitution also contained a clause that required presidential candidates to have lived in Madagascar for at least six months prior to the elections, effectively barring Ravalomanana and other opposition leaders living in exile from running in the next election. After being repeatedly postponed, the general election was held on 25 October 2013.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Katanga secession, {{political}} negotiations {{began to}} reconcile the disparate political factions. The negotiations coincided with the formation of an émigré political group, the Conseil National de Libération (CNL), by dissident Lumumbists and others in neighbouring Congo-Brazzaville. The negotiations culminated {{in the creation of a}} new, revised constitution, known as the Luluabourg Constitution, after the city in which it was written, to create a compromise balance of power. The new constitution increased the power of the presidency, ending the system of joint consultation between President and Prime Minister, and appeased federalists by increasing the number of provinces from six to 21 while increasing their autonomy. The constitution also changed the name of the state from the Republic of the Congo to Democratic Republic of the Congo. The constitution was passed in a <b>constitutional</b> <b>referendum</b> in June 1964 and Parliament was dissolved to await new elections. Kasa-Vubu appointed Tshombe, the exiled Katangese leader, as interim Prime Minister. Although personally capable, and supported as an anti-communist by Western powers, Tshombe was denounced by other African leaders such as King Hassan II of Morocco as an imperialist puppet for his role in the Katangese secession.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant-Colonel J. S. V. Hickman {{took over}} from Caine as {{commanding}} officer on 26 August 1968 {{and the rest}} of the year was uneventful for the RLI. The same was not true, however, for the Rhodesian government, which on 20 September 1968 accepted an invitation from Wilson for a new round of talks, this time aboard HMS Fearless, anchored off Gibraltar, for four days starting on 9 October 1968. These ended without agreement on the evening of 13 October 1968, when Smith flew back to Rhodesia. Unsuccessful attempts by both sides to salvage an accord from the Fearless talks continued for months afterwards but ultimately Smith's government resolved that compromise was impossible. It prepared a new constitution of its own and on 20 June 1969 called a <b>constitutional</b> <b>referendum,</b> polling public opinion on both the new constitution and the adoption of a republican form of government. The electorate firmly backed both of these proposals. As a result, Rhodesia became a republic with the new constitution in place on 2 March 1970.|$|E

50|$|The two <b>constitutional</b> <b>referendums</b> were {{mandatory}} referendums, {{which required}} both {{a majority of}} voters and cantons. The other three were optional referendums, which meant that only {{a majority of the}} public vote was required for the proposals to be approved.|$|R
