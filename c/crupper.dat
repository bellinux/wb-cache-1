25|$|Cruppers are {{not common}} on western saddles, but some English saddles are {{designed}} with <b>crupper</b> rings, particularly those designed to fit mules.|$|E
25|$|The {{equipment}} used by early roughriders {{consisted of a}} poley saddle or exercise pad, without stirrups or a <b>crupper</b> and a chest rein that ran from the girth to the rider's hand, leaving him without any control of the buckjumper's head. Bullock and bareback riders were still permitted to use two hands at this stage.|$|E
25|$|Cruppers {{were once}} part of the {{standard}} design of cavalry saddles. The McClellan saddle used by the United States Army utilized an optional <b>crupper</b> into the early 20th century. though difficulties with proper fitting eventually led the army to discontinue its use. Cruppers continue {{to be part of}} the ceremonial tack for some cavalry regiments and tent pegging teams.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cruppers</b> {{are seen}} on the saddles of some horses used to work cattle with a lance (such as horses of the buttero in Europe), but not on horses used to work cattle with a lasso.|$|R
2500|$|The {{invention}} of the stirrup occurred relatively late in history, considering that horses were domesticated in approximately 4500BC, and the earliest known saddle-like equipment were fringed cloths or pads with breast pads and <b>cruppers</b> used by Assyrian cavalry around 700 BC ...|$|R
60|$|Remounting I rode to {{the edge}} of the clump of bushes and found several of my companions, some of whom carried the {{carcasses}} of springboks at their <b>cruppers.</b> Hope revived at once, and I set off with them in search of another flock.|$|R
25|$|Canutt {{had been}} {{perfecting}} tricks {{such as the}} <b>Crupper</b> Mount, a leapfrog over the horse's rump into the saddle. Douglas Fairbanks used some in his film The Gaucho. Fairbanks and Canutt became friends and competed regularly at Fairbanks' gym. Canutt took small parts in pictures to get experience. It was in Branded a Bandit (1924) that his nose was broken in a 12-foot fall from a cliff. The picture was delayed several weeks, and when it resumed, Canutt's close shots were from the side. A plastic surgeon reset the nose, which healed, inspiring Canutt to remark that he thought it looked better.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>crupper</b> {{consists}} of a loop (the <b>crupper</b> itself) and an adjustable strap (<b>crupper</b> strap or back strap) that connects the <b>crupper</b> to back of a riding saddle or {{the other parts of}} a harness. [...] The strap runs from the horse's dock, over the croup, to the saddle or to the back band (sometimes called the saddle) of a harness.|$|E
2500|$|For driving, a <b>crupper</b> is used {{to prevent}} the parts of a harness that fit around {{the barrel of the}} horse (the girth, bellyband, back band and saddle) from {{slipping}} forward. [...] The <b>crupper</b> is adjusted to allow about an inch of play between the <b>crupper</b> and the dock. Some harnesses with breeching use this as an anchor instead of a <b>crupper.</b>|$|E
60|$|At {{the bottom}} of the stairs through the open door of the house I caught sight of the vague outline of a large barouche, the lanthorns of which threw a feeble light upon the <b>cruppers</b> of two horses and of a couple of men sitting on the box.|$|R
50|$|Although a girth {{is often}} enough to keep a well-fitting saddle in place, other pieces of {{equipment}} are also used in jumping or speed sports such as polo, eventing, show jumping, and fox hunting; or on rough terrain such as trail riding. These include breastplates, overgirths, <b>cruppers,</b> and, on pack saddles, breeching.|$|R
60|$|To all our entreaties and suggestions, however, {{our leader}} only replied by {{a shake of}} the head, and {{continued}} to swing his long legs {{over the side of}} the waggon with his eyes fixed intently upon the horsemen, many of whom had dismounted and were leaning their carbines over the <b>cruppers</b> of their chargers.|$|R
2500|$|Usually made of leather, the <b>crupper</b> loop is stuffed, {{traditionally}} with linseed {{to keep it}} supple in use, and molded into a {{tube that}} is shaped into a loop. [...] The <b>crupper</b> may be sewn to its strap, or attached to the strap by one or two buckles. [...] If the <b>crupper</b> has no buckle, then the skirt of the horse's tail is folded up onto the tailbone and the tailbone is slipped through the <b>crupper.</b> If it has buckles, the <b>crupper</b> is unbuckled and passed under the dock.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>crupper</b> {{has been}} a {{standard}} part of mule saddles for centuries. [...] In the 1614 spurious Avellaneda Segunda Parte to Don Quixote, a mule <b>crupper</b> is mentioned several times, and it is translated as [...] "crupper" [...] in two 18th Century English translations.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>crupper</b> {{needs to}} be snug {{enough to keep the}} saddle or harness in place, but not so tight that the horse is irritated or the skin of the tail is damaged. [...] Cruppers are {{adjusted}} to engage only when needed; pressure is not meant to be constantly applied. [...] If a <b>crupper</b> is too tight, it can cause severe chafing, discomfort and sores. If it is too loose, the saddle or harness may not stay in the proper position. If used in an improper manner for too long a period of time, the horse may even [...] become disabled in the hindquarters. [...] The loop of a <b>crupper</b> is kept very clean.|$|E
2500|$|When riding, <b>cruppers</b> are {{particularly}} useful on animals with low withers, because this conformation allows the saddle to slip forward as the animal travels downhill. [...] Though not {{a substitute for}} a correctly fitted saddle, they are often used on mules, as many saddles, particularly those made for horses, are more likely to slide forward on a flatter-backed mule.|$|R

Most of you mortals are peacocks; some having tails, {{and some}} not; {{those who have}} them will be sure to thrust their plumes in your face; for the rest, they will display their bald <b>cruppers,</b> and still screech for admiration. But when a great genius is born into Mardi, he nods, and is known." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{troop of}} horses {{had broken out}} of the fenced paddock of the Railway Company. They came on like a whirlwind, and dashed over the line snorting, kicking, {{squealing}} in a compact, piebald, tossing mob of bay, brown, grey backs, eyes staring, necks extended, nostrils red, long tails streaming. As soon as they had leaped upon the road the thick dust flew upwards from under their hoofs, and within six yards of Giorgio only a brown cloud with vague forms of necks and <b>cruppers</b> rolled by, making the soil tremble on its passage.|$|R
2500|$|On pack horses, saddle {{breeching}} {{alone is}} quite common. [...] However, sometimes a <b>crupper</b> {{is used in}} addition to breeching.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>crupper</b> strap may be {{single or}} double (forked). It usually {{attaches}} via a snap or buckle to a <b>crupper</b> ring {{at the center}} of the cantle of the saddle, or to a pair of rings (dees) on either side of the cantle. Many riding saddles today are manufactured without properly placed rings, though rings can be added. [...] Or, in lieu of rings, a design used on English saddles utilizes a t-shaped brace that is inserted under the saddle between the rear panels and the tree.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>crupper</b> ( [...] ; occ. spelled crouper) is a {{piece of}} tack used on horses and other equids to keep a saddle, [...] harness or other {{equipment}} from sliding forward.|$|E
5000|$|There is evidence, though disputed, {{that humans}} first began riding the horse {{not long after}} domestication, {{possibly}} as early as 4000 BC. [...] The earliest known saddle-like equipment were fringed cloths or pads used by Assyrian cavalry around 700 BC. These were held on with a girth or surcingle that included breast straps and <b>cruppers.</b> From the earliest depictions, saddles became status symbols. To show off an individual's wealth and status, embellishments were added to saddles, including elaborate sewing and leather work, precious metals such as gold, carvings of wood and horn, and other ornamentation.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, {{as if it}} {{had come}} up out of the ground, I {{perceived}} a tram-car keeping abreast of the riding and walking and driving, and through all I was agreeably aware of files of peasants bestriding their homing donkeys on the bridle-path next the tram. I confess that they interested me more than my social equals and superiors; I should have liked to talk with those fathers and mothers of toil, bestriding or perched on the <b>cruppers</b> of their donkeys, and I should have liked especially to know what passed in the mind of one dear little girl who sat before her father with her bare brown legs tucked into the pockets of the pannier.|$|R
60|$|Under his {{garments}} Dick had wound a thin, {{but very}} strong, silken cord {{that he had}} purchased at Bangalore. It was four hundred feet in length, and considerably increased his apparent bulk, although he was still far from emulating the stoutness of Surajah. The halters of the pack horses were attached to the <b>cruppers</b> of the riding ponies, and after a final instruction to Ibrahim that if {{at the end of}} four days they had not returned, he was to endeavour to find out what had happened to them, and was then to carry the news to Tripataly, they started for the fort. When they approached the gate they were, as before, hailed by the sentry.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>crupper</b> {{is used on}} riding saddles when {{riding a}} horse or mule with low withers in steep terrain. [...] Cruppers are most often used in {{activities}} such as endurance riding, mounted orienteering, competitive trail riding, and for recreational trail riding in mountains.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>crupper</b> {{is used to}} {{keep the}} {{equipment}} placed on a horse's back from slipping forward. [...] Cruppers are seen most often on horse harnesses. [...] They are also used on the surcingles of bitting rigs, riding saddles, and, occasionally, pack saddles.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} rules for how tack and horses should be handled are known. [...] For example, it was taboo {{to use the}} whip as a prop or to touch an arrow to the whip; such crimes were {{punishable}} by death. [...] In Genghis Khan's time, strict rules dictated the way horses were to be used on campaign. [...] The Khan instructed his general Subutai, [...] "See to it that your men keep their <b>crupper</b> hanging loose on their mounts and the bit of their bridle out of the mouth, except when you allow them to hunt. [...] That way they won't be able to gallop off at their whim [...] [...] Having established these rules--see to it you seize and beat any man who breaks them. ... Any man...who ignores this decree, cut off his head where he stands." ...|$|E
60|$|The rain still {{fell in a}} thin drizzle that soaked through {{caps and}} coats, made the bridles slimy and the saddles {{slippery}} and damp. A veil of vapour hung over the horses' <b>cruppers,</b> and was rendered fuller and thicker every moment with the breath that came from their nostrils. The wind no longer blew with gusty fury--its strength {{seemed to have been}} spent with the grey light of day--but now and then it would still come sweeping across the open country, and dash itself upon the wall of forest trees, lashing against the horses' ears, catching the corner of a mantle here, an ill-adjusted cap there, and wreaking its mischievous freak for a while, then with a sigh of satisfaction die, murmuring among the pines.|$|R
60|$|Our {{prospects}} were fair, {{but they}} were false, for, ere long, the rain began again. However, we were reckless by that time and defied it. Riding up the kloof that I had traversed on foot, we sighted bucks but got no shot. Gaining {{the top of the}} kloof we saw more bucks--out of range. We passed over the shoulder of the mountain into another glen, and skirted the top of a precipice. While descending some slopes at an angle of I know not what, the use of our <b>cruppers</b> became strikingly apparent. I began, {{for the first time in}} my life, to feel anxiety as to the strength of a horse's tail. In going up such places the saddle girths were severely tried, but the mane kept one from slipping down one's perpendicular animal.|$|R
6000|$|To keep Clothes {{from the}} wet.--Mr. Parkyns says, [...] "I {{may as well}} tell, also, how we managed to keep our clothes dry when {{travelling}} in the rain: this was rather an important consideration, seeing that each man's wardrobe consisted of what he carried on his back. Our method was at once effective and simple: if halting, we took off our clothes and sat on them; if riding, they were placed under the leathern shabraque of the mule's saddle, or under any article of similar material, bed or bag, that lay on the camel's pack. A good shower-bath did none of us any harm; {{and as soon as}} the rain was over, and the moisture on our skins had evaporated, we had our garments as warm, dry, and comfortable as if they had been before a fire. In populous districts, we kept on our drawers, or supplied their place with a piece of rag, or a skin; and then, when the rain was over, we wrapped ourselves up in our 'quarry,' and taking off the wetted articles, hung them over the animal's <b>cruppers</b> to dry." [...] Another traveller writes:-- ...|$|R
2500|$|In August 1944 the Australian Bushmen's Carnival Association (ABCA) {{was formed}} by the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales, {{as a result of}} the {{increase}} in the number of bushmen's carnivals. The purpose of this formation was to standardise regulations and rules, but insufficient support was given and the association was terminated in 1947. Another national association, for professional riders, the Australian Rough Rider's Association (ARRA) was formed on 1 January 1945 with Ron Boardman as chairman and R. M. Williams as secretary. [...] Later that year this association adapted and adopted American rules and regulations for their competitions. They held their first rodeos in South Australia and the [...] "Hoofs & Horns" [...] magazine publicised and supported this group. The ARRA adopted a standard saddle, for the buckjumping, which had a 15inch tree, 2¼ inch kneepads and was held in place with a <b>crupper</b> and girth. In 1988 the ARRA changed their name to the Australian Professional Rodeo Association (APRA).|$|E
2500|$|The North Iranian Eurasian nomads {{known in}} Europe as Scythians and in Asia as Saka {{developed}} an early form of saddle with a rudimentary frame, which included two parallel leather cushions, with girth attached to them, a pommel and cantle with detachable bone/horn/hardened leather facings, leather thongs, a <b>crupper,</b> breastplate, and a felt shabrack [...] adorned with animal motifs. [...] These {{were located in}} Pazyryk burials finds. [...] These saddles, found in the Ukok Plateau, Siberia were dated to 500-400 BC. Iconographic evidence of a predecessor to the modern saddle {{has been found in}} the art of the ancient Armenians, Assyrians, and steppe nomads depicted on the Assyrian stone relief carvings from the time of Ashurnasirpal II. The Scythians also developed an early saddle that included padding and decorative embellishments. Though they had neither a solid tree nor stirrups, these early treeless saddles and pads provided protection and comfort to the rider, with a slight increase in security. The Sarmatians also used a padded treeless early saddle, possibly as early as the seventh century, BC. and depictions of Alexander the Great depict a saddle cloth.|$|E

60|$|She leaned {{well out}} of the window, trying to see. The gloom had {{gathered}} more closely in, and round her the veil of vapour from the horses' steaming <b>cruppers</b> hung heavily in the misty air. In front of her the straight lines of a few fir trees stood out dense and black against the greyness beyond, and between these lines purple tints of various tones and shades mingled one with the other, merging the horizon line with the sky. Here and there a more solid black patch indicated the tiny houses of the hamlet of Le Crocq far down in the valley below; from some of these houses small lights began to glimmer like blinking yellow eyes. Marguerite's gaze, however, did not rest on the distant landscape--it tried to pierce the gloom that hid her immediate surroundings; the mounted men were all round the coach--more closely round her than {{the trees in the}} forest. But the horses were restless, moving all the time, and as they moved she caught glimpses of that other coach and of Chauvelin's ghostlike figure, walking rapidly through the mist. Just for one brief moment she saw the other coach, and Heron's head and shoulders leaning out of the window. If his sugar-loaf hat was on his head, and the bandage across his brow looked like a sharp, pale streak below it.|$|R

I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he wears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he won't put his head into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now I'm ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It's like turning an old coat; {{going to bring the}} flesh on the other side now. I don't like this {{cobbling}} sort of business-- I don't like it at all; it's undignified; it's not my place. Let tinkers' brats do tinkerings; we are their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at the beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at the conclusion; not a cobbler's job, that's at an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end. It's the old woman's tricks to be giving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all old women have for tinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once. And that's the reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore when I kept my job-shop in the Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let me see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship's stern. Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some superstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the job. But I'm made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don't budge. <b>Cruppered</b> with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard tray! But never mind. We workers in woods make bridal bedsteads and card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can. Hem! I'll do the job, now, tenderly. I'll have me--let's see--how many in the ship's company, all told? But I've forgotten. Any way, I'll have me thirty separate, Turk's-headed life-lines, each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down, there'll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath the sun! Come hammer, caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let's to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Stand to your pikes, men!' roared Saxon, in a {{voice of}} thunder, and we had scarce time to form our square and throw {{ourselves}} inside of it, before the whirlwind of horse was upon us once more. When the Taunton men had joined us a weak spot had been left in our ranks, and through this in an instant the Blue Guards smashed their way, pouring through the opening, and cutting fiercely to right and left. The burghers {{on the one side}} and our own men on the other replied by savage stabs from their pikes and scythes, which emptied many a saddle, but while the struggle was at its hottest the King's cannon opened {{for the first time with}} a deafening roar upon the other side of the rhine, and a storm of balls ploughed their way through our dense ranks, leaving furrows of dead and wounded behind them. At the same moment a great cry of 'Powder! For Christ's sake, powder!' arose from the musqueteers whose last charge had been fired. Again the cannon roared, and again our men were mowed down as though Death himself with his scythe were amongst us. At last our ranks were breaking. In the very centre of the pikemen steel caps were gleaming, and broadswords rising and falling. The whole body was swept back two hundred paces or more, struggling furiously the while, and was there mixed with other like bodies which had been dashed out of all semblance of military order, and yet refused to fly. Men of Devon, of Dorset, of Wiltshire, and of Somerset, trodden down by horse, slashed by dragoons, dropping by scores under the rain of bullets, still fought on with a dogged, desperate courage for a ruined cause and a man who had deserted them. Everywhere as I glanced around me were set faces, clenched teeth, yells of rage and defiance, but never a sound of fear or of submission. Some clambered up upon the <b>cruppers</b> of the riders and dragged them backwards from their saddles. Others lay upon their faces and hamstrung the chargers with their scythe-blades, stabbing the horsemen before they could disengage themselves. Again and again the guards crashed through them from side to side, and yet the shattered ranks closed up behind them and continued the long-drawn struggle. So hopeless was it and so pitiable that I could have found it in my heart to wish that they would break and fly, were it not that on the broad moor there was no refuge which they could make for. And all this time, while they struggled and fought, blackened with powder and parched with thirst, spilling their blood as though it were water, the man who called himself their King was spurring over the countryside with a loose rein and a quaking heart, his thoughts centred upon saving his own neck, come what might to his gallant followers.|$|R
