He {{turned back toward the}} airport. About 2 min later, there was a loud noise, which was {{followed}} by a progressive loss of all power. Subsequently, the aircraft was damaged during an emergency landing at night in a marshy area about 1 to 2 mi from the airport. An exam of the engine revealed the #5 connecting rod <b>cap</b> <b>bolt</b> had failed, which resulted in further damage of the engine. Probable cause: Failure of the #5 connecting rod bolt. Factors related to the accident were: Dark night and the soft and wet (marshy) terrain conditions in the emergency landing area.|$|E
50|$|Tightening a {{threadless}} headset requires {{tightening the}} preload bolt (or <b>cap</b> <b>bolt)</b> in {{the cap on}} the top of the stem. This bolt is connected to a star nut driven down into the steerer tube that acts as an anchor by gripping the inside of the steerer tube with a downward force. The star nut may be replaced by a self expanding wedge in some designs. The bolt compresses the stem down onto spacers, usually aluminum, which in turn compress the headset bearing cups. The preload bolt does not hold the fork onto the bike; after the preload is set, the stem bolts must be tightened to secure the fork in place. The adjustment must be made such that there is no play in the bearings, but allow the fork to turn smoothly without binding or excessive friction.|$|E

(See: photograph of Star-nut) Newer model forks, with carbon fiber steerer tubes, use an expander plug instead of a star nut, which once installed serves the same purpose as the star nut, but will not damage carbon fiber forks as a starnut will (by design a star-nut digs into the surrounding tube, which, while safe with aluminum, can weaken carbon fiber to the point of failure).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, fatigue {{strength}} of the engine damper <b>cap</b> screw <b>bolt</b> is determined. Engine damper cap screw is critical fastener. Critical fastener is a term used to describe a cap screw that, upon failure, causes immediate engine shutdown or possible harm to person. So, determination of {{fatigue strength}} is important. S-N method is used for cap screw fatigue strength determination by testing number of samples at different alternating load keeping mean load constant. Alternating load is increased until cap screws begin to fail. But for measurement of axial load in fasteners, ultrasonic bolt gauging method is used. It has been observed that fatigue failure takes place on the thread of <b>cap</b> screw <b>bolt</b> due to high stress concentration on the thread...|$|R

500|$|At {{the tower}} a {{temporary}} eyebolt was screwed into the [...] capsule, and a chain hoist {{was used to}} lower the capsule into the gadget. As the capsule entered {{the hole in the}} uranium tamper, it stuck. Robert Bacher realized that the heat from the plutonium core had caused the capsule to expand, while the explosives assembly with the tamper had cooled during the night in the desert. By leaving the capsule in contact with the tamper, the temperatures equalized and in a few minutes the capsule had slipped completely into the tamper. The eyebolt was then removed from the capsule and replaced with a threaded uranium plug, a boron disk was placed on top of the capsule, an aluminum plug was screwed into the hole in the pusher, and the two remaining high explosive lenses were installed. Finally, the upper Dural polar <b>cap</b> was <b>bolted</b> into place. Assembly was completed at about 16:45 on July 13.|$|R

Iron tie rods 1+1/4 in wide serve as diagonal cross-braces on the panels, and there is a horizontal tension rod at each end of the truss. A set of expansion rollers at the west end, intended to provide additional stability, has since corroded due to road salt and rust.|$|R

50|$|The {{centrifuge}} is {{a hollow}} cylinder 6 {{inches in diameter}} and 13.5 inches long with both end caps in place. The cylinder is mounted perpendicular to the canister and supported by ball bearings housed in {{the upper and lower}} bulkheads. The rotational axis of the centrifuge is formed by shafts centrally located in the vertical plane at right angles to the cylinder, held in place by the ball bearings. Thin, shallow-domed end <b>caps</b> are <b>bolted</b> to each end of the centrifuge with intervening rubber gaskets to prevent leakage. In the center of each cap is a fitting which allows frog specimens to be fully instrumented and mounted directly to the end caps before insertion into the centrifuge, and immersion.

50|$|Changes to {{the diesel}} engined models saw the 2,495 cc Td5 (in-line direct-injected straight-five engine) introduced, {{in line with}} the updated Defender models. This {{electronically}} managed engine was smoother, producing more usable torque at lower revs than its 300Tdi predecessor. The Td5 engine is often mistakenly attributed to BMW; it was derived from the Rover L-series passenger car engine and further developed by Land Rover. The 3,948 cc V8 petrol version from the Discovery 1 was replaced with the Range Rover P38 Thor 4.0-litre Rover-derived V8. There was no actual increase in capacity over the previous 3.9-litre engine. Although the basic design of the engine was similar, it was actually quite different internally: it used a different crankshaft, had larger bearing journals with cross <b>bolted</b> <b>caps,</b> different con rods, and different pistons. The blocks were machined differently, to accept extra sensors for the Gems and Bosch (Thor) injection system and to allow the extra stroke of the 4.6 crankshaft. For the 2003 and 2004 model year Discovery II they changed to the 4.6-litre V8 (though the 4.0 continued as the only V8 option offered in the UK). ACE (Active Cornering Enhancement, an electronically controlled hydraulic anti-roll bar system) was fitted to some versions, which reduced cornering roll. Self-levelling air springs were fitted to some models and European type-approval for seven-seat vehicles was only given to air-sprung examples.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The work {{sets forth}} the search results of new, more {{efficient}} design solutions for metal silos, namely, {{the analysis of}} existing types of profiles cross-section in a steel wall of such silo and development of less material-intensive section of corrugated profile. Methodology. To achieve the set goal there were researched the existing types of capacitive structure profiles and their strain-stress state under the load. The analysis {{was performed on the}} results of computational experiments. The prototype object was mathematical computer models. The calculations were made using the finite-element method. For computational experiment there was used the design-computing system Structure CAD for Windows. Findings. In this work there were obtained the data allowing to assess work of the profiles and to find more effective type of cross-section in terms of its material consumption. In the process of joint study of the authors a new type of profile for capacitive structures was developed; it has higher utilization efficiency and the attachment point of individual steel sheets with this type of profile. Both solutions are easy to install, reliable in operation and can be manufactured in the conditions of modern industrial production using standard equipment, materials and components. Originality. A new type of corrugated profile cross-section for steel silo walls was proposed; it has higher load carrying capacity and rigidity and allows reducing the metal thickness without changing the structure carrying capacity that results in material consumption reduction of the whole structure. For this and similar types of profiles there was designed and proposed the attachment point of individual corrugated sheets screwed with extending flange, which enables the unit connection in case of small size corrugations, where the distance is not sufficient to accommodate the <b>bolt</b> <b>cap</b> between the individual corrugations. Practical value. Application of the proposed solutions can increase efficiency, manufacturability and maintainability of steel silo wall structures. The results obtained during the research show promise for further development of research on finding new and more economic solutions for corrugated steel silo wall design, as well as other ways to reduce material consumption of bulk material storage structures...|$|R
40|$|This thesis compiles {{information}} {{of a kind}} of bracket named “Trunnion cap” which is used at some of the loaders and trucks that are developed at Atlas Copco Rock Drills AB in Örebro, the information is needed to create a technical guideline for design of new trunnion caps. The thesis is limited to investigate trunnion caps that are used to attach steering cylinders on six different vehicles, MT 436 B, MT 5020, MT 6020, ST 1030, ST 14 and ST 1520. It investigates what angles the force generated by the steering cylinders acts from, which varies from a range of 6 to 96 degrees depending on which vehicle and frame it is. The forces generated by the steering cylinder have also been calculated regarding the maximum pressure which is between 21, 5 and 30 MPa for the different vehicles. Any kind of useful information from customers has also been searched partly by asking employees at Atlas Copco customer centres around the world if they are aware of any occasions were trunnion <b>caps</b> or <b>bolts</b> to trunnion <b>caps</b> have broke down. The results indicate that no problems exist today and that old problems had to do with lack of service. Even the internal databases for service reports have been searched for failures that regard parts to trunnion caps but no relevant information was found. The tolerances for the holes in the trunnion caps and to the pins that are assembled to the trunnion caps has also been identified with a result that vary, some assemblies have a tight fitting while others have a loose fitting. Finally has the availability of bolts with property class 8. 8 and 10. 9 been investigated where it has been noticed that the lead time for bolts with property class 8. 8 more often is shorter than it is for bolts with property class 10. 9. Detta examensarbete sammanställer och tar fram information om en typ av fäste som kallas “Trunnion cap” som används på några av de truckar och lastare som utvecklas på Atlas Copco Rock Drills AB i Örebro. Informationen behövs för att skapa en konstruktionsriktlinje för trunnion caps. Arbetet är begränsat till att undersöka de trunnion caps som används vid infästning av styrcylindrar på sex olika fordon, MT 436 B, MT 5020, MT 6020, ST 1030, ST 14 och ST 1520. Det undersöker från vilka vinklar kraften som genereras av styrcylindern verkar från. Dessa vinklar verkar inom ett intervall från 6 till 96 grader. Själva kraften har också beräknats med avseende på maximalt styrtryck vilket varierar från 21, 5 till 30 MPa beroende på fordon. Värdefull information från kunder har också eftersökts delvis genom att fråga anställda vid några av Atlas Copcos marknadsbolag runt om i världen om de är medvetna om några tillfällen då trunnion caps eller bultar till trunnion caps har havererat. Svaren på denna fråga tyder på att inga problem existerar idag men att de problem som funnits tidigare berott på bristande service. Även Atlas Copcos interna databaser för servicerapporter har genomsökts på rapporter som rör delar till trunnion caps, dock utan att någon relevant information hittats. Examensarbetet har även sammanställt de toleranser som hålen i trunnion caps:en samt axeln som monteras dit har. Resultatet varierar då några sammanställningar har greppassning medan andra har spelpassning. Slutligen har även tillgängligheten på bult med hållfasthetsklass 8. 8 och 10. 9 undersökts där det har noterats att ledtiden för bult med hållfasthetsklass 8. 8 i allmänhet är kortare än för bultar med hållfasthetsklass 10. 9...|$|R
