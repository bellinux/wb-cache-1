40|$|The {{investigation}} {{reported in}} this paper is carried out to study the feasibility of using crushed bricks to substitute the <b>coarse</b> aggregate (<b>gravel)</b> in <b>concrete.</b> Two types of concrete mixing are prepared. The first one {{is a mixture of}}   1 : 2 : 4 without crushed bricks and is used as a reference mixture. The second one is made of different weight of crushed bricks (as a percentage from the weight of the coarse aggregate). A total of 30 numbers of concrete specimens are casted with and without crushed bricks and  tested under compression and split tension as per relevant to British standard specifications. Test results indicated that using crushed bricks reduces the strength of concrete. Also, the percentage of water to cement ratio increases for constant slump when the percentage of crushed bricks increased. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Well-rounded <b>coarse</b> <b>gravel</b> {{provides}} {{clues to}} the depositional process. The <b>coarse</b> <b>gravel</b> of the Mogollon Rim in central and northern Arizona, called Rim Gravel, was examined at two widely separated and representative locations. Further characteristics of the <b>coarse</b> <b>gravel</b> {{was obtained from the}} literature. The <b>coarse</b> <b>gravel</b> occupies the highest terrain in the region and is very coarse in east-central Arizona. It is deduced that this <b>coarse</b> <b>gravel</b> was deposited as a sheet and eroded into remnants during the Recessional Stage of the Genesis Flood. We conclude that the Rim Gravel provides evidence that the Flood/post-Flood (D/P) boundary corresponds to the stratigraphic location of rocks termed “late Cenozoic ” in the uniformitarian geological column {{in this part of the}} western United States. This interpretation is relevant to theories for the formation of many notable geomorphic features, including the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River...|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} about water flow and transport {{properties in the}} unsaturated zone is becoming an important predisposition for groundwater protection. The water flow and transport processes were studied in a field laboratory–alysimeter in the <b>coarse</b> <b>gravel</b> aquifer of Selniška Dobrava, using isotope methods. The δ 18 O isotope values were measured monthly in the sampled unsaturated zone water and precipitation during the long-term period from 2001 to 2005. The isotope oscillations in the measuring points show that the δ 18 O seasonal effect in precipitation {{can be observed in}} the unsaturated zone with some delay in peak and with amplitude reduction with depth. Mean residence times of the water in the unsaturated zone were modelled with the FLOWPC 3. 1 computer package. The estimation of water flowvelocity in the Selniška Dobrava <b>coarse</b> <b>gravel</b> unsaturated zone by lumped-parameter LP) models is 0. 015 m/day. The estimation of water mean residence time at lysimeter location is 5 years, i. e. in the range of 3. 8 - 9. 4 years. The research confirmed that the isotope methods are suitable tools for water flow tracing in the <b>coarse</b> <b>gravel</b> unsaturated zone,and that lumped-parameter models can be used to estimate water mean residence time in the unsatuarated zone...|$|R

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{the influence of}} gravel mesh (fine and coarse) and vegetation (Phragmites and Arundo) on the efficiency of a reed bed, a pilot plant was included after the wastewater treatment plant of a cosmetic industry treatment system according to a 2 (2) factorial experimental design. The maximum biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total phosphorous (TP) reduction was observed in the reactor, where Phragmites and fine gravel were used. In the reactor with Phragmites and <b>coarse</b> <b>gravel,</b> the maximum total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total suspended solids (TSS) reduction was observed. The maximum total solids reduction was measured in the reed bed, which was filled with Arundo and <b>coarse</b> <b>gravel.</b> Conclusively, the treatment of a cosmetic industry's wastewater by reed beds as a tertiary treatment method is quite effective...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} isotope hydrograph separation method in the determination of snowmelt impact on groundwater dynamics and {{in the investigation of}} preferential flowin the high permeable <b>coarse</b> <b>gravel</b> unsaturated zone. Preferential flows as well as matrix flow dynamics are important for groundwater storage in the unsaturated zone and for pollution transport to the saturated zone. Data analysis is based on data collected during the time of sudden snowmelt in March 2004 in the Selniška Dobrava lysimeter. The results indicate the piston flow effect phenomenon also in the high permeable <b>coarse</b> <b>gravel</b> aquifer at the time of infiltration of large quantitiesof water. The preferential flow influence decreases withdepth. A larger share of new water was observed upto 1. 5 m depth (38 %), while it decreases with depth...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the use {{of locally}} {{produced}} electrical are furnace (EAF) steel slag in concrete manufacturing is investigated. The slag was used as coarse aggregate since {{it proved to be}} quite hard and did not contain any appreciable free chemical compounds of potentially adverse effects such as lime. For comparison, crushed wadi gravel was used in parallel to the slag. Mechanical properties as well as the drying shrinkage of both slag and <b>gravel</b> <b>concrete</b> were measured. The results showed compressive and flexural strengths for slag concrete to be similar to slightly higher than <b>gravel</b> <b>concrete,</b> splitting tensile strength and modulus of elasticity to be higher and drying shrinkage to be lower than that of <b>gravel</b> <b>concrete.</b> The results of this investigation are encouraging since they show that using slag as coarse aggregate in concrete has no n~gative effects on short tenn properties of hardened concrete. However, further investigation on the effect of steel slag on the long tenn properties of concrete is required before a recommendation can be given for using the steel slag as coarse aggregate in concrete...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTextural and {{compositional}} analyses using Chemistry Camera (ChemCam) remote microimager and {{laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy}} (LIBS) {{have been}} performed on five float rocks and <b>coarse</b> <b>gravels</b> along the first 100 m of the Curiosity traverse at Bradbury Rise. ChemCam, the first LIBS instrument sent to another planet, offers the opportunity to assess mineralogic diversity at grain-size scales (~ 100 μm) and, from this, lithologic diversity. Depth profiling indicates that targets are relatively free of surface coatings. One type of igneous rock is volcanic and includes both aphanitic (Coronation) and porphyritic (Mara) samples. The porphyritic sample shows dark grains that are likely pyroxene megacrysts in a fine-grained mesostasis containing andesine needles. Both types have magnesium-poor basaltic compositions and in this respect {{are similar to the}} evolved JakeMatijevic rock analyzed further along the Curiosity traverse both with Alpha-Particle X-ray Spectrometer and ChemCam instruments. The second rock type encountered is a coarse-grained intrusive rock (Thor Lake) showing equigranular texture with millimeter size crystals of feldspars and Fe-Ti oxides. Such a rock is not unique at Gale as the surrounding <b>coarse</b> <b>gravels</b> (such as Beaulieu) and the conglomerate Link are dominated by feldspathic (andesine-bytownite) clasts. Finally, alkali feldspar compositions associated with a silica polymorph have been analyzed in fractured filling material of Preble rock and in Stark, a putative pumice or an impact melt. These observations document magmatic diversity at Gale and describe the first fragments of feldspar-rich lithologies (possibly an anorthosite) that may be ancient crust transported from the crater rim and now forming float rocks, <b>coarse</b> <b>gravel,</b> or conglomerate clasts...|$|R

The {{mobility of}} river-bed surface particles is examined in the lower Ebro River downstream from dams that were closed several decades ago. Mobility is analysed by comparing photographs of painted bed areas taken {{before and after the}} 2003 - 2004 flood season, and also by comparing lines of painted particles after the floods. The peak of the maximum flood had a recurrence interval of 2 years. Medium and <b>coarse</b> <b>gravels</b> were widely exported from all the study reach, reflecting a disequilibrium between the competence of the flow to entrain and transport them and the rate of supply from upstream. By contrast, very <b>coarse</b> <b>gravels</b> and larger particles remained immobile, since floods were not competent enough to mobilise them. The partial entrainment of surface particles caused a coarsening of the river-bed surface, even in areas where sediments are loose and the river-bed is highly active during small floods.
