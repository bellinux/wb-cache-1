However, variations in machinability are regularly observed when producing the same part out of different material batches. This leads to a non-robust production process with increased manufacturing costs as well as unforeseen stops and maintenance of machines. In this study, emphasis is laid on studying the effect of microstructure variations on machinability in <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steels.</b> Different microstructures have been produced by changing holding time and temperature in the annealing process. The microstructure was altered {{as much as possible}} with respect to pearlite nodular size, pearlite morphology and amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite. Since a homogeneous material is required, relatively small sample diameters had to be used. Therefore, the machinability ranking (with respect to tool wear) was performed with help of the Volvo Standard Machinability Test which is a short-term test. Additionally, chip breakability was evaluated and measurements of cutting forces and surface roughness were performed. The tests have shown that a <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> with larger pearlite nodular size (produced by a higher austenitizing temperature) provides better chip breakability but also an increased tool wear compared to a material with smaller pearlite nodular size. Hence, to achieve a more robust production process for <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steels,</b> it might be necessary to include pearlite nodular size and/or amount of pro-eutectoid ferrite in the materials specification. Moreover, the different tests have revealed that hardness is not a suitable criterion for machinability...|$|R

40|$|In {{manufacturing}} industry, {{variations in}} machinability are regularly observed when producing {{the same part}} out of different material batches of a <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel.</b> However, material batches showing a decreased machinability often have properties within the material specification. Thus, for an increased machinability and a more robust production of <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> parts, the relationship between microstructure and machinability needs to be further investigated. In this study, machinability has been evaluated for a specific <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> with respect to pearlite nodular size, phase distribution and interlamellar spacing of pearlite. These variations in microstructure have been achieved by altering the annealing cycle, i. e. austenitizing temperature, holding time and temperature for pearlite formation. The criterions for machinability which are taken into consideration in this investigation are tool wear and chip formation. Furthermore, a comparison of cutting forces and surface integrity for the tested microstructures will be presented. The results from tests show a difference between material with larger pearlite nodules and a material with smaller pearlite nodules. For tool wear, the material with larger pearlite nodules has a decreased machinability. However, for chip formation the result is opposite, and a material with larger pearlite nodules has an increased machinability...|$|R

40|$|For <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel,</b> the {{relationship}} between microstructure and machinability is investigated. To {{be able to determine}} the influence of morphology, i. e. grain size, phase distribution and interlamellar spacing in pearlite, homogeneous material is required. However, a homogeneous microstructure can only be guaranteed when small material volumes are used. For that reason the Volvo Standard Machinability Test has been applied, as it allows ranking of materials with respect to their machinability by removing only small amounts of material (~ 800 mm of a bar with 50 mm diameter for each material). In addition to what is described in the standard of the test, a number of observations and experiences have been made. In this article the observations in connection with the Volvo Standard Machinability Test are critically discussed.

40|$|Specimens of {{ferritic}}-pearlitic, fully ferritic and austempered ductile irons, {{as well as}} aluminium bronze, quenched and {{tempered steel}} and <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> <b>steel</b> were studied by pin on disc testing under mixed-boundary lubrication conditions. The aim was to determine their tribological behaviour at two different contact pressures. The weight loss of the samples (pins and discs) was determined when possible and the wear coefficient was calculated for all of the tests. In addition, optical microscopy observations of the wear scars were performed and hardness profiles of the pins were taken from underneath the worn surface into the bulk. The study has shown that, at the lower contact pressure of 50 MPa, ADI outperformed all of the other materials in showing the lowest total wear coefficient for all of the tribo-pairs (pin + disc), and also for all individual samples (pin or disc), except for the ferritic-pearlitic ductile iron pin when paired against {{quenched and tempered steel}}. At the higher contact pressure of 1 GPa, ADI outperformed bronze when paired against <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> <b>steel,</b> and showed a valuable increase in wear resistance when paired against itself. At 50 MPa the increased wear resistance of ADI is attributed to a higher initial hardness and slightly larger deformation hardening, while at 1 GPa the better properties are attributed not only to a higher hardness but may also in a small part be due to the deformation induced transformation into martensite.

A standardized milling test was used to assess machinability (with respect to tool wear) as this method has the advantage of only needing small diametrical samples and low material volumes. From the results of the test, it can be concluded that machinability is more influenced by pearlite nodular size than by pearlite morphology. Furthermore, it can be stated that hardness is not a suitable criterion for determining machinability of <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel.</b> In the manufacturing process of transmission parts (such as gear milling/hobbing) high speed steel tools are commonly used.

The results of SMA measurements performed on flat induction hardened steel discs with different case depths confirm the feasibility of detecting principal stress axes by measuring the angular variation of magnetic permeability. The permeability signals along the principal axes were found to vary monotonically with the residual stresses measured by XRD, but the signals are in general smaller for samples with a larger case depth. The magnetomechanical properties of the martensitic case and ferritic/pearlitic core of the induction hardened sample were studied by measuring magnetostriction curves from strip samples that were cut from the case and core regions, respectively.

40|$|Considering the {{processing}} of <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steel</b> components, the machining {{as well as the}} heat treatment offer great capability for cost savings. By increasing the carburising temperature from today approximately 940 °C up to e. g. 1050 °C significant process time reductions are achievable due to the acceleration of diffusion and absorption processes. While increasing the carburising temperature, the appearance of prohibited coarse austenite grains has to be avoided. However the former austenite grain size is an attribute of the overall process chain from <b>steel</b> melting to <b>case</b> <b>hardening.</b> In this work, the influence of the manufacturing process on grain size stability of <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>steels</b> has been investigated. To simulate the hot forming process in laboratory scale compression tests (Rastegaev samples) have been performed to different standard steel grades (16 MnCr 5 / 20 NiCrMo 2) as well as two micro-alloyed (16 MnCr 5 Nb / 20 NiCrMo 2 Nb) steel grades. An increase in grain size stability during carburising simply depends on the size of precipitates. Unfortunately the use of a mean precipitate size is not significant, because the size distribution is modified by every single process step - even the <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> itself. The results of this work show, that if deformation is carried out by warm deformation below a specific temperature T 1 - which {{is a function of the}} chemical composition - grain size stability is assessed by the condition of precipitates upon delivery. The low temperature prevents a change in precipitate morphology by low diffusion. Increasing the deformation temperature the grain size stability during following <b>case</b> <b>hardening</b> depends on the deformation degree. The higher the deformation degree, the bigger is the risk of illegal grain coarsening.

It is shown that thermophysical and mechanical transverse inhomogeneity profiles in industrial <b>case</b> <b>hardened</b> <b>steel</b> samples are well correlated.
