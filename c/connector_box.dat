40|$|We {{describe}} a modular and hence flexible system for connecting MR surface coils {{to create a}} receiver array. Up to 16 individual coils of different size and shape depending on the application are plugged into a <b>connector</b> <b>box</b> that houses the control electronics. Preamplification, matching and detuning circuitry are housed on a circuit board directly attached to each coil loop. Electrical adjustments for tuning or decoupling for each coil configuration are not needed thanks to effective preamplifier decoupling provided through a Pi matching network. Radio-frequency safety and electrically stable cabling are ensured by multiple radio-frequency traps. Array modules for 1. 5 and 3 T have been simulated, constructed, tested, and used for imaging experiments...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of an integrated electrochemical cell culture monitoring system, based on enzyme-biosensors and chemical sensors, for monitoring indicators of mammalian cell metabolic status. MEMS technology was used to fabricate a microwell-format silicon platform including a thermometer, onto which chemical sensors (pH, O 2) and screen-printed biosensors (glucose, lactate), were grafted/deposited. Microwells were formed over the fabricated sensors to give 5 -well sensor strips which were interfaced with a multipotentiostat via a bespoke <b>connector</b> <b>box</b> interface. The operation of each sensor/biosensor type was examined individually, and examples of operating devices in five microwells in parallel, in either potentiometric (pH sensing) or amperometric (glucose biosensing) mode are shown. The performance characteristics of the sensors/biosensors indicate that the system could readily be applied to cell culture/toxicity studies...|$|E
40|$|FMOS: the Fiber Multiple-Object Spectrograph is {{the next}} common-use {{instrument}} of the Subaru Telescope, having a capability of 400 targets multiplicity in the near-infrared 0. 9 − 1. 8 µm wavelength range with a field coverage of 30 ′ diameter. FMOS consists of three units: 1) the prime focus unit including the corrector lenses, the Echidna fiber positioner, and the instrument-bay to adjust the instrument focus and shift the axis of the corrector lens system, 2) the fiber bundle unit equipping two fiber slits on one end and a fiber <b>connector</b> <b>box</b> with the back-illumination mechanism {{on the other end}} on the bundle, 3) the two infrared spectrographs (IRS 1 and IRS 2) to obtain 2 × 200 spectra simultaneously. After all the components were installed in the telescope at the end of 2007, the total performance was checked through various tests and engineering observations. We report the results of these tests and demonstrate the performance of FMOS...|$|E
50|$|In early days, before {{televisions}} came standard with 75Ω {{coaxial antenna}} <b>connectors,</b> cable <b>boxes</b> came with adapters {{that would allow}} the coaxial cable to connect to the 300Ω twin lead screws used with traditional antennas.|$|R
50|$|After {{already having}} been officially placed under its command on 18 May, on 21 May 345e CACC was {{actually}} reunited with 19e BCC as its 1st Company, {{to boost the}} number of operational tanks of the battalion; other measures taken to that effect included putting turrets on four vehicles of 3rd Company and fitting new sight <b>connector</b> <b>boxes</b> {{to some of the}} old vehicles of 1st Company; two of the latter's old tanks were cannibalised to provide spare parts. By these measures the battalion was able to commit itself to battle; it fought for the first time near Amiens on 24 May and was able to field a peak strength of 24 vehicles the next day.|$|R

50|$|Type H {{couplers}} are in {{widespread use}} on multiple unit passenger trains in the UK built from the mid 1970s onwards. The previous generation of slam door units fitted with Buckeye couplers had required a shunter {{to get down}} onto the track and stand between the two units to manually trip the coupler mechanism as well as connect or disconnect the air pipes and electrical jumper leads. In order to reduce staffing costs and cut down station dwell times, British Rail looked to incorporate an automatic coupler mechanism in its new power-door trains. Class 313 units were the first stock to incorporate this. Air-operated Tightlock couplers were chosen, together with underslung electrical <b>connector</b> <b>boxes</b> controlled by a Drum switch, and this allowed drivers to single-handedly attach or split a train without having to leave the cab.|$|R
40|$|Control system {{re-engineering}} of a mission-critical working accelerator is a problem, but it {{is possible}} with well-defined procedures and methodology. We have finished an upgrade of control system of a 1 GeV electron linac in SPring- 8. The upgrade was divided into two phases, taking into consideration the availability of the linac. In the first phase, we mainly replaced software part with SPring- 8 standard framework. In the second phase, we re-engineered the VME systems to maximize availability of the linac operation considering reliability, usability, expandability and flexibility. We newly developed an optically linked remote I/O system and intelligent motor control units. By adopting these systems, we could re-allocate the VME controllers away from known noise sources and also reduce the number of the controllers. All interface <b>connector</b> <b>boxes</b> were re-designed and replaced to achieve easy maintenance and expandability. We report the upgrade of the linac control system by focusing on the methodology with introducing the new remote I/O system and the motor control unit...|$|R
50|$|<b>Box</b> <b>connectors</b> join conduit to a {{junction}} box or other electrical box. A typical <b>box</b> <b>connector</b> is inserted into a knockout in a {{junction box}}, with the threaded end then being secured with a ring (called a lock nut) {{from within the}} box, as a bolt would be secured by a nut. The {{other end of the}} fitting usually has a screw or compression ring which is tightened down onto the inserted conduit. Fittings for non-threaded conduits are either secured with set screws or with a compression nut that encircles the conduit. Fittings for general purpose use with metal conduits may be made of die-cast zinc, but where stronger fittings are needed, they are made of copper-free aluminum or cast iron.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the events}} {{mentioned}} above, 19e BCC, {{a few years earlier}} still an elite armour unit, one of the most modern of France, had {{at the time of the}} German invasion of 10 May 1940 been reduced to a rather ineffective force. Its first company had been reassigned, even the latter's old vehicles were inoperational because the cannon-machinegun <b>connector</b> <b>boxes</b> of their sights had to be removed to be fitted in the new tanks — that had been delivered without any. Of the tanks of the other two companies 21 had been rebuilt with the longer gun, fifteen of 2nd Company and six of 3rd Company, but only five of these had been given a complete overhaul and could be considered truly battle-ready. The remaining nine tanks of 3rd Company were in the process of being rebuilt and without turret. Nor was there any direct prospect of receiving newer vehicles, as it had been decided to raise another two autonomous companies with these: 346e and 350e Compagnie Autonome de Chars de Combat with ten and twelve vehicles respectively. This decision proved to be ill-founded however: in the end the situation forced a reunion of all Char D2 units into one battalion.|$|R

50|$|Foundry Networks designed, {{manufactured}} {{and sold}} high-end enterprise and service provider switches and routers, {{as well as}} wireless, security, and traffic management solutions. It was {{best known for its}} Layer 2 & 3 Ethernet switches. Foundry Networks was the first company to build and ship a gigabit Ethernet switch in 1997; to build a Layer 3 switch, also in 1997; to build the first Layer 4-7 switch in 1998 and to include 10 Gigabit Ethernet single <b>connectors</b> in its <b>boxes</b> (since 2001).|$|R
50|$|Fiber to {{the office}} (FTTO) is an {{alternative}} cabling concept for LAN network office environments. It combines passive elements (fibre optic cabling, patch panels, splice <b>boxes,</b> <b>connectors</b> and standard copper 8P8C patch cords) and active mini-switches (called FTTO switches) to provide end devices with Gigabit Ethernet. FTTO involves centralised optical fibre cabling techniques to create a combined backbone/horizontal channel; this channel is provided from the work areas to the centralised cross-connect or interconnect by allowing the use of pull-through cables or splices in the telecommunications room.|$|R

The bridge {{is a solid}} piece of acrylic and the magnetic pickups are built into fingerboard, allowing for the individual volume controls. The DynaFUZZ is an onboard distortion circuit.The electronics are powered by an external 18v battery box and the power is sent through the cable using a 4 conductor cable terminating in U174/U (TP120) <b>connectors.</b> The battery <b>box</b> also has the output to run to an amplifier or headphones.|$|R
40|$|Linear Logic [Gir 87] is a {{logic that}} has two presentations: a {{classical}} sequent calculus {{and a more}} original presentation using proof nets. Proof nets are graphs of <b>connectors</b> and <b>boxes</b> connected together by links. Each cell has a given numbers of ports and links connect ports two by two (no sharing). Boxes serve to bound nets. This formalism was introduced because several proofs in sequent calculus which are not essentially different (see for example the exchange rule or commutable rules) correspond to the same proof net. Nets go beyond logic because they {{may be used to}} perform fi-reduction in -calculus [Lam 90, Mac 95] or used as a model of calculus as interaction nets [Laf 90]. However, not every net corresponds to linear logic proofs and a criterion serves to distinguish between bad proof structures and proof nets. Using linear logic with mix rule (saying that two proofs side by side form a proof), this criterion looks if the graph have not bad cycle. The same mechanism may be used [...] ...|$|R

40|$|International {{standards}} play {{an important}} role in the Photovoltaic industry. Since PV is such a global industry it is critical that PV products be measured and qualified the same way everywhere in the world. IEC TC 82 has developed and published a number of module and component measurement and qualification standards. These are continually being updated to take advantage of new techniques and equipment as well as better understanding of test requirements. Standards presently being updated include the third edition of IEC 61215, Crystalline Silicon Qualification and the second edition of IEC 61730, PV Module Safety Requirements. New standards under development include qualification of junction <b>boxes,</b> <b>connectors,</b> PV cables, and module integrated electronics as well as for testing the packaging used during transport of modules. After many years of effort, a draft standard on Module Energy Rating should be circulated for review soon. New activities have been undertaken to develop standards for the materials within a module and to develop tests that evaluate modules for wear-out in the field (International PV Module QA Task Force). This paper will discuss these efforts and indicate how the audience can participate in development of international standards...|$|R
