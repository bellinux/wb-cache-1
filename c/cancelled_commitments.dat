The rule of the English king, on the other hand, was weakened by the dynastic Wars of the Roses and in September Edward IV even had to flee to the Burgundian County of Flanders. Duke Charles backed Edward's return to England and now opened his harbours providing the Hansa forces to capture several vessels of the king's enemies. Upon the restoration of the English king, Charles again withdrew his support immediately.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the impact of unpaid commitments by the central government on public healthcare financing and national health expenditure estimates. The health spending data were obtained from the federal public budget system, Siga Brasil, and were analyzed for their registration as unpaid <b>commitments</b> and <b>canceled</b> unpaid <b>commitments</b> from 2002 to 2014. We found that healthcare spending by the federal government was lower than the minimum level required by law for most years. As a result, approximately R$ 11. 3 billion were not allocated to public healthcare by the federal government. As for health expenditure estimates, we found that the cancellation of unpaid commitments, among other issues related to national public accounting, affects the estimation of health spending by the accrual method, which is the recommended regimen in health accounts...|$|R

50|$|To be {{distinguished}} slightly from other secular oblates, {{there is a}} small number of conventual or claustral oblates, who reside in a monastic community. If the person has not done so previously, after a year's probation they make a simple commitment of their lives to the monastery, which is received by the superior {{in the presence of the}} whole community. More on the level of committed volunteers, they would share in the life of the community and undertake, without remuneration, any work or service required of them. They are not, however, considered monks or nuns themselves. Often they wear a religious habit similar to, but distinct from, that of the monks or nuns. A conventual oblate may <b>cancel</b> this <b>commitment</b> at any time; and it is canceled automatically if the superior sends the oblate away for good reason, after simple consultation with the chapter.|$|R

50|$|Among {{the most}} {{affected}} by the bursting {{of the internet and}} telecom bubbles were two {{of the largest and most}} active private equity firms of the 1990s: Tom Hicks' Hicks Muse Tate & Furst and Ted Forstmann's Forstmann Little & Company. These firms were often cited as the highest profile private equity casualties, having invested heavily in technology and telecommunications companies. Hicks Muse's reputation and market position were both damaged by the loss of over $1 billion from minority investments in six telecommunications and 13 Internet companies at the peak of the 1990s stock market bubble. Similarly, Forstmann suffered major losses from investments in McLeodUSA and XO Communications. Tom Hicks resigned from Hicks Muse at the end of 2004 and Forstmann Little was unable to raise a new fund. The treasure of the State of Connecticut, sued Forstmann Little to return the state's $96 million investment to that pointand to <b>cancel</b> the <b>commitment</b> it made to take its total investment to $200 million. The humbling of these private equity titans could hardly have been predicted by their investors in the 1990s and forced fund investors to conduct due diligence on fund managers more carefully and include greater controls on investments in partnership agreements.|$|R

5000|$|The {{costs for}} the Tribal Class ships {{escalated}} above the costs first envisaged and the original order of ships, (over twenty), was cancelled after the first seven ships had been completed. Only 4 would have been built {{if it had been}} possible to <b>cancel</b> the contractual <b>commitments</b> the Royal Navy had entered into for the supply of complex engines and machinery [...] for eight frigates. The ships were rather small, at 360 ft, which reduced the options for later modernisation and were always going to be limited by their single-shaft propulsion. The class were still good warships in spite of being fitted with outdated guns, (they were described by some as 'guided flagpoles') if sometimes capable of 18rpm for the first two minutes, and proved the usefulness of the general purpose frigate concept and gas turbine propulsion, but the average unit costs of the Type 81s completed in 1963-64 was £500,000 more than the first 8 Leanders and the final cost of over ₤5 million of the first Tribal, Ashanti, completed in 1961 was considered too high and hence limited the number actually built. (The original intent was to build 23 Type 81s) This meant that further 1960s RN frigate development would be based on the more conservative steam powered Type 12 'Whitby' Class, subsequently modernised in the Type 12M 'Rothesay' Class and finalised in the excellent Type 12I Leander. The later Royal Navy Type 21 'Amazon Class' General Purpose Frigates were originally envisaged for a similar gunboat role to the Tribal Class ships and to operate East of Suez.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Telecommunications Act of 1996 expanded the traditional definition of universal service [...] affordable, nationwide telephone service [...] to include eligible schools and libraries. The act authorized the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to begin a program to help these institutions acquire advanced telecommunications services. Under FCC's program, {{often referred to as}} the 'e-rate' program, schools and libraries can receive discounts from the vendors on the cost of eligible telecommunications services, Internet access, and internal connections. FCC appointed the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) as the program's permanent administrator, although FCC retains responsibility for overseeing the program's operations and ensuring compliance with its rules. USAC's Schools and Libraries Division (SLD) is responsible for carrying out the program's day-to-day operations. Schools and libraries do not receive funding directly from the program. The committed funds are held by USAC, which reimburses vendors directly for the discounted portion of the e-rate approved services that they provide. This report provides information on (1) the amount of funds requested and committed for all three program years (1998 - 2000) and (2) the result of FCC and SLD's steps to reduce the amount of committed funds that go unspent. GAO found that requests for e-rate support have risen steadily each year since program funding began in 1998. For the third and fourth program years, total requests greatly exceeded the program's current annual funding cap of $ 2. 25 billion. For the third program year (2000), the requests exceeded $ 4. 2 billion. Although SLD had sufficient e-rate funds to support all valid requests for telecommunications services and Internet access for the third year, it could not support requests for internal connections from applicants with discount levels of 81 percent or lower, leaving nearly $ 2 billion of the $ 3. 2 billion requested for internal connections unfunded. For the fourth program year (2001), SLD estimates that applicants requested nearly $ 5. 2 billion in program funds as of April 2001. However, it appears that a large proportion of the nearly $ 3. 5 billion in internal connection requests may go unfunded. Data from January 2001 indicate that more than $ 880 million (24 percent) of the $ 3. 7 billion committed to applicants for the first two program years remains unused. This is a decrease from $ 1. 3 billion in unused funds (35 percent) at the end of August 2000. GAO also found that FCC and SLD have taken steps to reduce the amount of committed funds that go unspent, including <b>canceling</b> the funding <b>commitments</b> of second-year applicants that have not confirmed that they have begun receiving services associated with these funds. ...|$|R
5000|$|The capital {{assessment}} {{is intended to}} capture all aspects of a financial institution’s business that would be impacted under the baseline and more adverse scenarios. [...] Supervisors will carefully evaluate the forecasts submitted by each financial institution to ensure they are appropriate, consistent with the firm’s underlying portfolio performance and reflective of each entity’s particular business activities and risk profile. The assessment of the firm’s capital {{and the size of}} any potential needed additions to capital will be determined by the supervisors. [...] The assessment of capital adequacy considers many factors including: the inherent risks of the institution’s exposures and business activities, the quality of its balance sheet assets and its off-balance-sheet commitments, the firm’s earning projections, expectations regarding economic conditions and the composition and quality of its capital. Specific factors supervisors consider include: uncertainty about the potential impact on earnings and capital from current and prospective economic conditions; asset quality and concentrations of credit exposures; the potential for unanticipated losses and declines in asset values; off‐balance sheet and contingent liabilities (e.g., implicit and explicit liquidity and credit commitments); the composition, level and quality of capital; the ability of the institution to raise additional common stock and other forms of capital in the market; and other risks that are not fully captured in regulatory capital calculations. Under current rules for bank holding companies, supervisors expect bank holding companies to hold capital above minimum regulatory capital levels, commensurate with the level and nature of the risks to which they are exposed. That amount of capital held in excess of minimum capital requirements should be commensurate with their firm‐specific risk profiles, and account for all material risks. The assessment of capital under the two macroeconomic scenarios being used in the capital assessment program will permit supervisors to ascertain whether the buffer over the regulatory capital minimum is appropriate under more severe but plausible scenarios. [...] An institution that requires additional capital will enter into a commitment to issue a CAP convertible preferred security to the U.S. Treasury in an amount sufficient to meet the capital requirement determined through the supervisory assessment. Each institution will be permitted up to six months to raise private capital in public markets to meet this requirement and would be able to <b>cancel</b> the capital <b>commitment</b> without penalty. The CAP convertible preferred securities will be converted into common equity shares on an as‐needed basis. Financial institutions that issued preferred capital under Treasury’s existing Capital Purchase Program (TARP 1) will have the option of redeeming those securities and replacing them with the new CAP convertible preferred securities. [...] The capital {{assessment is}} part of the supervisory process and thus subject to the same framework used for bank examinations or bank holding company inspections. There will be ample opportunity for discussions between the financial institutions and supervisory agencies regarding the loss estimates and earnings forecasts during the capital assessment process.|$|R
