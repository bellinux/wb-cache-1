5|$|Late in the game, Vanessa discovers a clone {{of herself}} in a CAMS {{facility}} but is forced to abandon her when the building's self-destruct sequence is initiated. After destroying the CAMS central core, Vanessa encounters a digital projection of the client, whose appearance is identical to her own. She speculates {{that she is a}} clone of the client, but the client <b>counters</b> <b>that</b> none of their memories may be real. Vanessa debates whether to continue her work as a mercenary as the game ends.|$|E
5|$|After Gordon fends off a Combine {{attack on}} the base, Alyx gives Dr. Kleiner the message from Judith Mossman {{recovered}} at the Citadel. It contains footage and the coordinates of the Borealis, an Aperture Science research vessel which, Kleiner explains, vanished along with part of the surrounding drydock. Kleiner insists {{that it should be}} used to aid the Resistance effort, while Eli <b>counters</b> <b>that</b> it is impossible to control and must be destroyed. They agree that Alyx and Gordon will travel to the Borealis and attempt to find Mossman. Alyx unconsciously delivers the G-Man's message to her father, shaking him. Alone with Gordon, Eli reveals that it was the G-Man who provided the test sample that caused the Black Mesa incident, and that he whispered the same warning to him as Gordon entered the test chamber. He promises to explain more after the portal is closed.|$|E
5|$|Completely unskilled at combat, Quark {{stands to}} either lose Grilka or be killed. Worf again helps the Ferengi; using a special device {{implemented}} by Dax, Worf {{is able to}} control Quark's body movements from an adjacent holosuite and help Quark defend himself with a bat'leth. Although the device temporarily malfunctions, he ultimately defeats the bodyguard. The scene concludes with Grilka and Quark alone and enamored with one another. Worf opines to Jadzia that Quark is unworthy of such a great Klingon woman, and she <b>counters</b> <b>that</b> Worf's interest in Grilka is superficial, asserting that there are better options awaiting him. Observing that Worf still fails to see the subtext in her hints, Dax initiates an aggressive romantic encounter. In the next scene, both couples are shown in the infirmary; Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) treats their wounds and quickly deduces {{the source of their}} injuries.|$|E
50|$|Milton Friedman, in particular, <b>countered</b> <b>that,</b> even if {{rational}} expectational theories do {{not describe}} reality per se, {{they should be}} kept since they provide accurate predictions (instrumentalism). Allison <b>countered</b> <b>that</b> Friedman has not provided enough evidence to demonstrate his theories actually predict anything, and criticizes his arguments as unscientific.|$|R

5|$|Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion Lannister discuss {{dealing with}} the slaver fleet. Daenerys, Tyrion, Missandei and Grey Worm meet with the Masters, who offer to let Daenerys return to Westeros in return for keeping Missandei and the Unsullied and killing the dragons. She <b>counters</b> <b>that</b> the meeting was called to discuss the Masters' {{surrender}} and rides Drogon into the bay with Rhaegal and Viserion and burns the fleet. Missandei tells the Masters that Daenerys has ordered {{one of them to}} die as punishment for their crimes. Although they offer the lowborn Yezzan, Grey Worm kills the other two masters instead and Tyrion tells Yezzan to warn the other masters of Daenerys's power. Daario Naharis leads the Dothraki to slaughter the Sons of the Harpy, who are massacring freedmen outside the city.|$|E
5|$|Davos Seaworth confronts Melisandre about Shireen's death. Melisandre {{admits to}} burning Shireen alive, but {{points out that}} she did it for the Lord of Light. Davos rebuts by saying that Stannis was {{defeated}} anyway and that Melisandre's actions were all for naught, forcing her {{to admit that she}} was wrong. Davos requests permission from Jon Snow to execute Melisandre, but she <b>counters</b> <b>that</b> she will be useful in the coming war against the White Walkers. Jon exiles Melisandre from the North and threatens to execute her if she ever returns. Later, Jon and Sansa Stark discuss who will lead the united Stark forces, with each deferring to the other.|$|E
5|$|Mulder confronts Skinner and The Smoking Man, {{believing that}} he and Scully were deceived into taking the case without knowing about the contagion. Mulder is adamant that the public should know the truth about Pinck's actions. The Smoking Man <b>counters</b> <b>that</b> public {{knowledge}} of the truth would create mass panic and {{do more harm than}} good. Mulder tries to take his case to Scully, but she agrees that exposing Pinck may result in a deadly hysteria. Paul becomes the only remaining proof of the company's crimes, but he takes a hostage and is killed by the Marshals before Mulder can convince him to divulge the contents of Torrance's package. The episode ends with Skinner warning Mulder to be more wary of the situations he will find himself in.|$|E

5|$|The {{surrender}} of Japan on 14 August precluded further attacks. Groves had already directed Farrell to prepare teams {{to inspect the}} effects of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Farrell had begun assembling the required personnel and equipment. Farrell arrived in Hiroshima by air on 8 September as part of a group, equipped with portable geiger <b>counters,</b> <b>that</b> was headed by himself, and also included Brigadier General James B. Newman, Jr from the US Army Air Forces, Japanese Rear Admiral Masao Tsuzuki, who acted as a translator, and Colonel Stafford L. Warren, the head of the Manhattan District's Medical Section. They remained in Hiroshima until 14 September and then surveyed Nagasaki from 19 September to 8 October. They were greatly impressed by both the damage done by the atomic bombs, and the extensive Japanese preparations for the Allied invasion that had been planned prior to the surrender.|$|E
5|$|Marge, Reverend Lovejoy and Ned attempt {{without success}} to bring Homer {{back to the}} congregation. One Sunday morning, while {{everybody}} else is at church, Homer falls {{asleep on the couch}} smoking a cigar, which ignites some magazines and ultimately sets the whole house ablaze. Homer wakes up but quickly succumbs to the thick smoke and faints. Apu, chief of Springfield's volunteer fire department, rushes to the Simpson house with other firefighters including Krusty the Clown, Chief Wiggum, and Barney. Meanwhile, Ned runs into the burning house to rescue Homer and pulls him out just as the firefighters arrive. After the fire is out, Homer declares that God was delivering vengeance. Reverend Lovejoy <b>counters</b> <b>that</b> God was working through the hearts of Homer's friends, despite their different faiths. Homer agrees to give church another try and the next Sunday is there, albeit snoring loudly through the service. Appearing in his dreams again, God consoles Homer on the failure of his religion. He starts to tell Homer the meaning of life, but is cut off by the ending credits.|$|E

25|$|Many {{producers}} of reality programming argue that since these shows are mostly, if not entirely, unscripted, {{there is no}} writer. The WGA <b>counters</b> <b>that</b> {{the process of creating}} interesting scenarios, culling raw material, and shaping it into a narrative with conflict, character arc, and storyline constitutes writing and should fall under its contract.|$|E
25|$|In {{its most}} typical form, a hex-and-counter wargame has a map with a {{hexagonal}} grid imposed over it, units are represented with cardboard <b>counters</b> <b>that</b> commonly have a unit type and designation {{as well as}} numerical combat and movement factors. Players take turns moving and conducting attacks. Combat is typically resolved with an odds-based combat results table (CRT) using a six sided die.|$|E

Since 1979, the United States has led international efforts to use sanctions to influence Iran's policies, including Iran's uranium enrichment program, which Western governments fear is intended for developing the capability to produce nuclear weapons. Iran <b>counters</b> <b>that</b> its nuclear program is for civilian purposes, including generating electricity and medical purposes.|$|E
25|$|An {{article in}} Science {{magazine}} by John Bohannon describes {{some of the}} criticisms, {{as well as some}} responses from the Lancet report's lead author Gilbert Burnham. According to Bohannon and Johnson, the Lancet paper indicates that the survey team avoided small back alleys for safety reasons. But this could bias the data because deaths from car bombs, street-market explosions, and shootings from vehicles should be more likely on larger streets. Burnham <b>counters</b> <b>that</b> such streets were included and that the methods section of the published Lancet paper is oversimplified.|$|E
25|$|Odin {{says that}} Loki must be insane to make Gefjun his enemy, as her wisdom about the fates of men may equal Odin's own. Loki says that Odin does {{a poor job}} in handing out honor in war to men, and that he's often given victory to the faint-hearted. Odin {{responds}} that even if this is true, Loki (in a story otherwise unattested) once spent eight winters beneath the earth as a woman milking cows, and during this time bore children. Odin declares this perverse. Loki <b>counters</b> <b>that</b> Odin once practiced seiðr {{on the island of}} Samsey (now Samsø, Denmark), and, appearing as a wizard, traveled among mankind, which Loki condemns as perverse.|$|E
