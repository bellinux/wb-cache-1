25|$|Antihistamines are {{effective}} at treating mild cases of pollinosis, {{this type of}} non-prescribed drugs includes loratadine, cetirizine and <b>chlorpheniramine.</b> They do not prevent the discharge of histamine, {{but it has been}} proven that they do prevent a part of the chain reaction activated by this biogenic amine, which considerably lowers hay fever symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Codeine {{preparations}} {{require a}} prescription in India. A preparation of paracetamol and codeine {{is available in}} India. Codeine is also present in various cough syrups as codeine phosphate including <b>chlorpheniramine</b> maleate. Pure codeine is also available as codeine sulphate tablets. Codeine containing cough medicine has been banned in India with effect from 14 March 2016. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has found no proof of its efficacy against cough control.|$|E
25|$|Misuse of multi-symptom cold medications, {{rather than}} using a cough {{suppressant}} whose sole active ingredient is dextromethorphan, carries significant risk of fatality or serious illness. Multi-symptom cold medicines contain other active ingredients, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen), <b>chlorpheniramine,</b> and phenylephrine, any of which can cause permanent bodily damage such as kidney failure, or even death, if taken on the generally accepted recreational dosing scale of dextromethorphan. Sorbitol, an artificial sweetener found in many cough syrups containing dextromethorphan, can also have negative side effects including diarrhea and nausea when taken at recreational dosages of dextromethorphan. Guaifenesin, an expectorant commonly accompanying dextromethorphan in cough preparations, can cause unpleasant symptoms including vomiting, nausea, kidney stones, and headache.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{experiments}} on frogs, the Japanese group {{carried out a}} series of classical pharmacological investigations of candicine on cats and rabbits, and on various isolated animal organs/tissues. In rabbits, doses of 0.6mg/kg, i.v., of candicine produced respiratory and cardiovascular disturbances lasting about 15 minutes. Body temperature was not affected; there was also mydriasis followed by miosis, and hypersalivation. In rabbits, i.v. doses of 2.1mg/kg produced apnea, followed by death. In anesthetized cats, doses of 0.06–0.12mg/kg, iv., also caused respiratory and cardiovascular disturbances: although the details were concentration-and time-dependent, the ultimate effects were ones of sustained respiratory stimulation and elevated blood pressure; the hypertension was not inhibited by atropine, but was antagonized by hexamethonium. Candicine caused contraction of the cat nictitating membrane. A concentration of 0.012mg/mL applied to the isolated guinea pig atrium caused a decrease in the amplitude and rate of contractions, these effects being enhanced by eserine, but inhibited by atropine pre-treatment. Concentrations of 3-6μg/mL produced contractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum which were inhibited by pre-treatment with atropine, hexamethonium, tubocurarine or cocaine, but were not affected by the presence of pyribenzamine or <b>chlorpheniramine.</b> Summarizing the results of these and other observations, the authors concluded that: candicine was primarily a stimulant of autonomic ganglia; it liberated catecholamines from the adrenal medulla; it showed muscarine-like and sympathomimetic effects in some assays, and it was a neuromuscular blocker of the depolarizing type. In many of these respects, candicine resembled nicotine and dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP).|$|E

2500|$|Dextromethorphan, or DXM, {{a common}} active {{ingredient}} {{found in many}} over-the-counter cough suppressant cold medicines, {{is used as a}} recreational drug and entheogen for its dissociative effects. It has almost no psychoactive effects at medically recommended doses. Dextromethorphan has powerful dissociative properties when administered in doses well above those considered therapeutic for cough suppression. Recreational use of DXM is sometimes referred to in slang form as [...] "robo-tripping," [...] whose prefix derives from the Robitussin brand name, or Triple Cs, which derives from the Coricidin brand. (The pills were printed with [...] "CCC" [...] for [...] "Coricidin Cough and Cold.") However, this brand presents a danger when used at recreational doses due to the presence of <b>chlorpheniramine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In Australia, codeine {{preparations}} must be {{sold only}} at a pharmacy. Preparations will often {{be a combination of}} paracetamol (500mg), ibuprofen (200mg) and doxylamine succinate (5mg), and the codeine content may range from 5mg to 15mg; preparations with in excess of 15mg per tablet are S4 (Schedule 4, or [...] "Prescription Only") medications. The item is given over the counter, no prescriptions, at the discretion of the pharmacist. Most preparations are considered S3 (schedule 3, or [...] "Pharmacist Only") medications, meaning that they must be sold with the direct involvement of a pharmacist. It must be labelled and usage history monitored by the pharmacist to help deter misuse and dependence. The exception to this rule is cold and flu preparations such as [...] "Codral".
