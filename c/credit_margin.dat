The paper also estimates a development of bank <b>credit</b> <b>margin</b> in banking industries of these countries in period from January 2004 to March 2010. Using Johansen cointegration and Granger causality tests on monthly data we investigate long-term as well as short-term causalities between the interest rates. The results suggest that interest rate relationships differ in all selected countries, and also that foreign majority owners of the Czech banks could affect interest rate policy of the subsidiaries to offset losses realized by the parent banks. ...|$|E

We show that, in individual-level randomizations with competitive spillovers, treatment-control differences in prices can inform an intuitive test {{of the degree of}} differentiation among firms. In the context of the Sierra Leone cocoa industry, traders compete by providing farmers credit, as well as through prices. Even when accounting for both the price and the <b>credit</b> <b>margin,</b> differentiation among traders is low. By combining the experimental results with quasi-experimental estimates of the pass-through rate, we then estimate market size the effective number of traders competing for farmers' supply and we find it to be substantially larger than the village.

40|$|Before {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis around 2008, the priority of the <b>credit</b> <b>margin</b> was comparatively low and was not taken into consideration as much as today. Many actors believed that credit risk could be neglected at various valuations. Due to {{that a lot of}} parties went bankrupt because of the low priorities. Today, this is a natural component in the financial market due to the capital regulation CRR and the Capital requirement directives (CRD IV), which are directly related to Basel III. In this thesis the authors have created a Credit valuation adjustment model, or a CVA-model, on behalf of the consulting firm AGL who want to use it in negotiations of interest rate swap with financial institutions. Factors as expected exposure, loss given default and probability of default are estimated in order to estimate a fair value for CVA. As a final product, the authors have created a model in VBA that can price CVA for individual contracts. This model is then evaluated and a sensitivity analysis is performed to see what impact credit rating and maturity have on the result...|$|E

30|$|This {{study found}} that trading <b>margins,</b> <b>credit</b> availability, and price discreteness affect the {{variance}} of returns in the Indian futures markets. The {{study also found that}} market participation was inadequate as a result of endogenous and exogenous conditional probabilistic reasons. Efficient trading <b>margins</b> and effective <b>credit</b> availability positions were not realized. Price discreteness had a negative impact on returns, as trading prices and credit availability in each of the trading hours were inversely related. Trading risks, and hence losses, were not minimized by hedging positions. The monopoly power in the Nifty market was 8.9526. Given this monopoly power, returns were less elastic with respect to the existing trading margins, financial resources, and market microstructure (price discreteness) that were available for reinvestment. Therefore, before investing in derivatives (index futures), market investors should evaluate trading <b>margins,</b> <b>credit</b> availability positions, and price discreteness.

Parallel to this, we find that the availability of credit lines in the main bank (measured by the unused credit lines as a proportion of total financial liabilities) depends positively on the assets of the firms, on its collateral, on a good credit history, and on close relationships with the main financial institution. This measure of availability of credit is less ambiguous than traditional measures like leverage, that are affected in opposite directions by demand and supply factors.

40|$|The product {{differentiation}} hypothesis for trade credit says that business managers use trade credit like advertising to differentiate their products.

40|$|Recent {{financial}} reforms, {{such as the}} Dodd-Frank Act in the U.

They also impose margining requirements on OTC derivative dealers. One question arising out of the debates over these reforms is, does a margin mandate increases the cost of hedging by non-financial corporations—the so-called end-users of derivatives? Our answer is, No. We show that a non-margined derivative is equivalent to a package of (i) a margined derivative, and (ii) a contingent line of <b>credit.</b> A <b>margin</b> mandate merely requires that this package be marketed as two distinct products, {{but it does not}} change the total financing or capital that the non-financial corporation requires to back its hedging. Nor does it raise the cost to banks or other dealer of offering the package, at least not directly. There may be an indirect effect if the clearing mandate succeeds in lowering systemic risk, but indirect macro effects such as this are {{beyond the scope of this}} paper. We also explore how accounting rules and bank regulations may treat the implicit credit embedded in the non-margined derivative differently from an explicit line of credit. This is important to understanding business and banker reaction to details of the proposal. Finally, we place the current debate in the context of the historical evolution of margin practices and regulations from the earliest trading of derivatives in the U.

40|$|Australian Real Estate Investment Trusts (AREITs) have {{experienced}} substantial growth and popularity since 1993. Amongst the major themes surrounding this sector during this time, were the increased attention from institutional investors, the trend towards {{and away from}} property-type diversification, significant merger and acquisition activities which led to increased trust size, the debate between internally versus externally managed trust structures, increased gearing levels, and the focus towards diversification into international property assets. While the AREIT sector had benefit from the increased flow of funds from institutional investors during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the recent impact of the 2008 global financial crisis has been a negative one, as increased <b>credit</b> <b>margins</b> meant that AREITs found it harder to access capital. Our paper aims to study the sensitivities of annualised AREIT returns from 1990 – 2008 towards a set of seven firm-specific variables and five market-wide risk variables. In particular, we examine the time-varying and cross-sectional differences between the impact of firm size, the degree of leverage, market-to-book ratios, property-type diversification, international diversification, the proportion of institutional investment, and management structure. Our set of market time-varying market risk indicators include, overall Australian market conditions proxied using the S 2 ̆ 6 P/ASX 200 Index, yields on 90 -day bank Treasury Notes to represent the short-term interest rate, yields on 10 -year Treasury Bonds to represent the long-term interest rate, and changes to the USD/AUD exchange rate to represent exchange rate risk components. We apply panel regressions for fixed and group effects onto balanced and unbalanced panels, categorised according to three sub-periods to study the major phases of the evolution of the AREIT sector. Our regression results find that the size effect has had a negative impact of returns, but this effect has been diminishing over time. Overall market risk was found to be significant and positive only since 2003, suggesting that more recently, AREITs behave more like stocks and less like defensive assets. Additionally, the relationship with exchange rate risks has been positive in recent years, due to more AREITs choosing to diversify internationally, particularly in the U. S. property markets. Our findings on the relationship between market-to-book ratios and AREIT returns depart from standard finance literature. It appears that the market places a premium on AREITs with higher market-to-book ratios. Compared to REITs in other countries, earlier preference for AREITs diversified across property types have appears to shift towards greater specialisation. We also find contrasting evidence on the impact of international diversification, and that domestic AREITs provided better returns than internationally diversified counterparts. This may be largely {{due to the fact that}} the AREITs classified as internationally diversified, primarily held assets in the U. S. rather than from a range of countries. We suggest that perhaps the difficulties in accessing economies of scale in the management of such off-shore properties have precluded these AREITs from holding a more geographically diversified property portfolio. The sensitivities of AREIT returns towards short-term and long-term interest rates also warrant further investigation. Our results are similar to another recent Australian study, but inconsistent with much of the existing literature. The relationship between returns and short term interest rates was found to be positive and significant before 2002, and the relationship with long-term interest rates was found to be negative and significant since 2003, indicating that AREITs exhibit less bond-like characteristics in the past five years...|$|R

30|$|The {{financial}} futures market in India is relatively new. The major advantage of derivatives as financial products {{is that their}} use minimizes {{the risks associated with}} securities. However, hedging effectiveness requires understanding key market signals such as trading <b>margins,</b> <b>credit</b> availability, and price discreteness. These signals have significant effects on limit orders and trading returns. Usually, the futures market maintains returns in relation to the tick value. The tick value indicates the trading volume trend and thus the profit. The tick value is calculated by multiplying the tick size (the minimum price movement for a unit of a security) by the contract size, where the contract size is the multiplication of the Standard & Poor’s CNX Nifty Index Futures (hereafter “Nifty Futures” or “Nifty”) price and its market lots. Therefore, the tick size and contract size influence the tick value, considering the rate of submission of limit orders. Trading margins influence the submission of limit orders, and hence the sustainability of futures trading and liquidity. Therefore, the optimal tick value is a matter of concern in derivatives trading, because the tick size (and there by price discreteness) is one of the important factor that influences the price formation in the derivatives market.|$|R

40|$|Support from a President's Research Grant at Simon Fraser University is gratefully acknowledged. The Product Differentiation Hypothesis for Corporate Trade Credit The product {{differentiation}} hypothesis for trade credit says that business managers use trade credit like advertising to differentiate their products. Prior studies of this hypothesis conclude that higher profit margins induce firms {{to increase trade}} credit and vice versa. Indeed, prior empirical studies show a positive relation between the level of trade <b>credit</b> and profit <b>margin.</b> This result is biased, however, by failure to control for capital intensity. High levels of capital intensity create barriers to entry and firms with relatively high capital investments tend to earn higher per-unit profit margins. Such firms also face higher fixed costs and benefit most from predictable sales and long-lived customer accounts. Our model shows that higher real-asset investment induces managers to adjust both trade credit and price, but that they may move in opposite directions. Contrary to early versions of the {{product differentiation}} hypothesis, optimal profit margin may increase when trade credit decreases and vice versa. Trade credit is linked to profit margin, but through capital intensity, and the relation need not be positive. We test our predictions empirically with data taken from COMPUSTAT. First, using industry trade receivables relative to industry revenues, we replicate the positive relation already documented between trade credit and unconditional profit margin.
