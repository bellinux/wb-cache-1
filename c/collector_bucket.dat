The excavation system has a dimension of 1. 21 m × 0. 66 m × 0. 74 m with a total weight of 65 kg. This four wheel drive robot consists of a bucket-ladder system for excavation and is capable of collecting 8 kg of regolith per minutes. It also includes a <b>collector</b> <b>bucket</b> which can contain 18 kg regolith and deposit in a bin which is installed on 50 cm height. The excavation hardware can be operated both manually and remotely through a web browser by logging in from any computer without direct visual and auditory access to the hardware. A KINECT sensor based semi-auto navigation is incorporated to avoid obstacle while motion. Publishe...|$|E

Wiltowski Magnetic separation of oxygen carrier from coal after combustion by-products was studied. Samples were prepared using iron metal, hematite and magnetite mixed with quartz {{in three different}} concentrations. A variable speed and magnetic field intensity separator unit was designed and constructed to prove the concept of magnetic separation. The unit went {{through trial and error}} steps to improve overall functionality and efficiency including belt material selection, electromagnet selection, feeder and <b>collector</b> <b>buckets,</b> drive drum and idler manufacturing. Prepared samples were tested in different velocities and magnetic field intensities...|$|R
50|$|In {{the region}} of Wajir, few {{residents}} have access to improved sanitation. Because of the high water table, pit latrines are impossible to use, and instead bucket toilets are common. By the time the waste <b>collectors</b> come, the <b>bucket</b> toilets are often already overflowing. These unhygienic circumstances can lead to frequent outbreaks of diarrhea.|$|R

And {{such is the}} law for Yaroslav’s vyra collector: the vyra <b>collector</b> takes 7 <b>buckets</b> of hops per week, also sheep or a meat carcass or 2 nogata (1 nogata = 1/20th of grivna); and on a Wednesday {{cheese and}} a marten pelt; and the same on Friday; and give him two {{chickens}} per day; and seven breads per week; and seven measures of grain; and seven measures of peas; and seven measures of salt; this for a vyra collector with a man; and for him 4 horses, which be given a measure of oats; for vyra collector 8 grivnas and 10 kunas in fees, and for the pageboy 12 squirrel pelts; and a grivna when he goes away, and for each victim 3 grivnas.|$|R
40|$|Prior to the Tropical Oceans Global Atmosphere-Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA-COARE), 42 Model 100 series optical gauges {{were tested}} in the rain {{simulator}} facility at Wallops Island before shipment to the field. Baseline measurements at several rain rates were made simultaneously with <b>collector</b> cans, tipping <b>bucket,</b> and a precision weighing gauge and held for post-COARE evaluation with a repeat set of measurements that were to be recorded after the instruments were returned. This was done {{as a means of}} detecting any calibration changes that might have occurred while deployed. Although it was known that the artificial rain in the simulator did not contain the required exponential distribution for accurate optical rain gauge rate measurements, use of the facility was necessary {{because it was the only}} means available for taking controlled observations with instruments that were received, tested, and shipped out in groups over a period of months. At that point, it was believed that these measurements would be adequately precise for detecting performance changes over time. However, analysis of the data by STI now indicates that this may not be true. Further study of the data will be undertaken to resolve this...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} concepts {{underlying the}} atmospheric input of phosphorus (P) to ecosystems, published rates of P deposition, measurement methods, and approaches to future monitoring and research. P conveyed {{through the atmosphere}} can be a significant nutrient source for some freshwater and marine ecosystems. Particle sources and sinks at the land-air interface produce variation in P deposition from the atmosphere across temporal and spatial scales. Natural plant canopies can affect deposition rates by changing the physical environment and surface area for particle deposition. Land-use patterns can alter P deposition rates by changing particle concentrations in the atmosphere. The vast majority of P in dry atmospheric deposition is conveyed by coarse (2. 5 to 10 μm) and giant (10 to 100 μm) particles, and yet these size fractions represent a challenge for long-term atmospheric monitoring {{in the absence of}} accepted methods for routine sampling. Most information on P deposition is from bulk precipitation <b>collectors</b> and wet/dry <b>bucket</b> sampling, both with questionable precision and accuracy. Most published annual rates of P deposition are gross estimates derived from bulk precipitation sampling in locations around the globe and range from about 5 to well over 100 mg P m– 2 year– 1, although most inland ecosystems receive between 20 and 80 mg P m– 2 year– 1. Rates below 30 mg P m– 2 year– 1 are found in remote areas and near coastlines. Intermediate rates of 30 to 50 mg P m– 2 year– 1 are associated with forests or mixed land use, and rates of 50 to 100 mg P m– 2 year– 1 or more are often recorded from urban or agricultural settings. Comparison with other methods suggests that these bulk precipitation estimates provide crude boundaries around actual P deposition rates for various land uses. However, data screening cannot remove all positive bias caused by contamination of <b>bucket</b> or bulk <b>collectors.</b> As a consequence, continued sampling with these standard collectors in a region will not reduce the large uncertainty in rates derived from existing data. Calibrated surface accumulation methods hold promise as a primary means to estimate P flux in future monitoring. New methods for long-term P deposition monitoring will require an intercomparison of P flux estimates from surrogate surfaces, impactor sampling of particle concentrations combined with deposition models, and “throughfall” estimates for natural canopies. With better sampling methods and more long-term monitoring data, the importance of atmospheric P deposition in ecosystem dynamics and management can be better understood and predicted...|$|R
