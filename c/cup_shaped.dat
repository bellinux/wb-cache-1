5|$|The corona, or paracorolla, is {{variously}} {{described as}} bell-shaped (funneliform, trumpet), bowl-shaped (cupular, crateriform, <b>cup</b> <b>shaped)</b> or disc-shaped with margins {{that are often}} frilled, and is free from the stamens. Rarely the corona is a simple callose (hardened, thickened) ring. The corona is formed during floral development as a tubular outgrowth from stamens which fuse into a tubular structure, the anthers becoming reduced. At its base the fragrances which attract pollinators are formed. All species produce nectar {{at the top of}} the ovary. Coronal morphology varies from the tiny pigmented disk of N. serotinus (see Table I) or the rudimentary structure in N. cavanillesii to the elongated trumpets of section Pseudonarcissus (trumpet daffodils, Table I).|$|E
5|$|The fruitbodies (ascocarps) of Geopyxis carbonaris are <b>cup</b> <b>shaped,</b> 1–2cm wide, {{and have}} fringed whitish margins. The inner spore-bearing {{surface of the}} cup, the hymenium, is brick red and smooth, while the {{exterior}} surface is a dull yellow, and may be either smooth or have blister-like spots (pustules). The stipe is small (1–1.5mm long and 1–2mm wide), whitish in color, and expands abruptly into the cup. The brownish flesh of the fungus is thin and brittle. It {{does not have any}} distinctive taste, but has an unpleasant smell when crushed in water. The edibility of the fungus is not known, but the fruitbodies are insubstantial and unlikely to be harvested for eating.|$|E

They are generally hermaphrodite, {{and have a}} short hypanthium, usually <b>cup</b> <b>shaped.</b> There are normally ten stamens and one elongated superior ovary, with a curved style. They are usually arranged in indeterminate inflorescences. Fabaceae are typically entomophilous plants (i.e. they are pollinated by insects), and the flowers are usually showy to attract pollinators.|$|E

500|$|The {{closely related}} vulcan elf cup (Geopyxis vulcanalis) has a pale orange to {{yellowish}} fruitbody that is deeply <b>cup</b> <b>shaped</b> before flattening in maturity, and its crushed flesh often has an odor of sulfur. It may be distinguished microscopically [...] by its paraphyses, which lack the orange-brown granules characteristic of G.carbonaria. It also has larger spores, measuring 14–22 by 8–11µm. Unlike G.carbonaria, it grows on substrates other than burned wood, including mosses, and needle duff. Tarzetta cupularis, which grows habitats similar to G.carbonaria, is distinguished microscopically by its spores {{that contain two}} oil droplets. Other genera with similar species with which G.carbonaria may be confused in the field include Aleuria, Caloscypha, Melastiza, and Sowerbyella.|$|E

5000|$|In the Hebrew Bible, the almond was {{a symbol}} of watchfulness and promise due to its early flowering. In the Bible the almond is {{mentioned}} ten times, beginning with Book of Genesis 43:11, where it is described as [...] "among the best of fruits". In Numbers 17 Levi is chosen from the other tribes of Israel by Aaron's rod, which brought forth almond flowers. According to tradition, the rod of Aaron bore sweet almonds on one side and bitter on the other; if the Israelites followed the Lord, the sweet almonds would be ripe and edible, but if they were to forsake the path of the Lord, the bitter almonds would predominate. The almond blossom supplied a model for the menorah which stood in the Holy Temple, [...] "Three <b>cups,</b> <b>shaped</b> like almond blossoms, were on one branch, with a knob and a flower; and three <b>cups,</b> <b>shaped</b> like almond blossoms, were on the other...on the candlestick itself were four <b>cups,</b> <b>shaped</b> like almond blossoms, with its knobs and flowers" [...] (Exodus 25:33-34; 37:19-20).|$|R

Many other small, yellow discos have fringed or hairy margins to the discs, like Anthracobia melaloma; this latter species grows on or near moss, rather than wood. Chlorosplenium chlora is another small cup fungus resembling B.citrina. It has a bright yellow outer surface, but the hymenium becomes develops greenish tints in age. The common jellyspot fungus (Dacrymyces stillatus) is usually smaller but can approach the dimensions of B.citrina.

2500|$|Virgil (Publius Vergilius Maro, 70 BC – 19 AD), {{the first}} known Roman writer {{to refer to the}} narcissus, does so in several places, for {{instance}} twice in the Georgics, Book four, l. 122 [...] "nec sera comantem Narcissum" [...] (nor had I passed in silence the late-flowering narcissus) and l. 159 [...] "pars intra septa domorum, Narcissi lacrymam" [...] (some within the enclosure of their Hives, lay Narcissus' tears). Virgil refers to the <b>cup</b> <b>shaped</b> corona of the narcissus flower, allegedly containing the tears of the youth Narcissus. Milton makes a similar analogy in his Lycidas [...] "And Daffodillies fill their Cups with Tears". Virgil also mentions narcissi three times in the Eclogues.

For the idea that narcissus could be purple, see also Dioscorides (επ ενίων δε πορφυροειδές) and Pliny (sunt et purpurea lilia). This was thought to be an allusion to the purple-rimmed corona of N. poeticus. Finally, in the eighth book of the Eclogues, Virgil writes, l. 53 [...] "narcisso floreat alnus" [...] (the alder with narcissus bloom).|$|E

40|$|The morphologic {{appearance}} of the optic disc is of interest in glaucoma. In contrast to descriptive classification systems that are currently used, a quantitative approach {{to the analysis of}} optic disc morphology is required. Our goal was to determine the optimal method for quantifying optic <b>cup</b> <b>shape</b> by comparing traditional (ovality, form-factor and neuroretinal rim (NRR) width ratio) and geometric morphometric approaches. Left optic disc stereophotographs of 160 (80 normal and 80 glaucomatous (stratified by severity)) subjects were examined. The optic cup margins were stereoscopically delineated with a custom tracing system and saved as a series of discrete points. The geometric morphometric methods of elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA) and sliding semi-landmark analysis (SSLA) were used to eliminate variation unrelated to shape (e. g. size) and yield a series of shape variables. Differences in optic <b>cup</b> <b>shape</b> between normal and glaucoma groups were investigated. Discriminant functions were computed and the sensitivity and specificity of each technique determined. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated for all methods and evaluated in their potential to discriminate between normal and glaucomatous eyes based on the shape variables. All geometric morphometric methods revealed differences between normal and glaucomatous eyes in optic <b>cup</b> <b>shape,</b> in addition to the traditional parameters of ovality, form-factor and NRR width ratio (p< 0. 0005). SSLA (minimum bending energy criterion - 18 points) had the best sensitivity (83 %) and area under the curve (AUC) (0. 91). EFA (72 points) performed similarly well (74 %, 0. 89) as did the set of traditional shape-based variables (76 %, 0. 86). This study demonstrated that a geometric morphometric approach for discriminating between normal and glaucomatous eyes in optic <b>cup</b> <b>shape</b> is superior to that provided by traditional single parameter shape measures. Such analytical techniques could be incorporated into future automated optic disc screening modalities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
60|$|To do perfect {{justice to}} the wood-walk away from the Ariccia I ought to touch upon the birds that were singing vespers as I passed. But the reader would find my rhapsody as poor {{entertainment}} as the programme of a concert he {{had been unable to}} attend. I have no more learning about bird-music than would help me to guess that a dull dissyllabic refrain {{in the heart of the}} wood came from the cuckoo; and when at moments I heard a twitter of fuller tone, with a more suggestive modulation, I could only hope it was the nightingale. I have listened for the nightingale more than once in places so charming that his song would have seemed but the articulate expression of their beauty, and have never heard much beyond a provoking snatch or two--a prelude that came to nothing. In spite of a natural grudge, however, I generously believe him a great artist or at least a great genius--a creature who despises any prompting short of absolute inspiration. For the rich, the multitudinous melody around me seemed but the offering to my ear of the prodigal spirit of tradition. The wood was ringing with sound because it was twilight, spring and Italy. It was also because of these good things and various others besides that I relished so keenly my visit to the Capuchin convent upon which I emerged after half-an- hour in the wood. It stands above the town on the slope of the Alban Mount, and its wild garden climbs away behind it and extends its melancholy influence. Before it is a small stiff avenue of trimmed live-oaks which conducts you to a grotesque little shrine beneath the staircase ascending to the church. Just here, if you are apt to grow timorous at twilight, you may take a very pretty fright; for as you draw near you catch behind the grating of the shrine the startling semblance of a gaunt and livid monk. A sickly lamplight plays down upon his face, and he stares at you from cavernous eyes with a dreadful air of death in life. Horror of horrors, you murmur, is this a Capuchin penance? You discover of course in a moment that it is only a Capuchin joke, that the monk is a pious dummy and his spectral visage a matter of the paint-brush. You resent his intrusion on the surrounding loveliness; and as you proceed to demand entertainment at their convent you pronounce the Capuchins very foolish fellows. This declaration, as I made it, was supported by the conduct of the simple brother who opened the door of the cloister in obedience to my knock and, on learning my errand, demurred about admitting me at so late an hour. If I would return on the morrow morning he'd be most happy. He broke into a blank grin when I assured him that this was the very hour of my desire and that the garish morning light would do no {{justice to the}} view. These were mysteries beyond his ken, and it was only his good-nature (of which he had plenty) and not his imagination that was moved. So that when, passing through the narrow cloister and out upon the grassy terrace, I saw another cowled brother standing with folded hands profiled against the sky, in admirable harmony with the scene, I questioned his knowing the uses for which he is still most precious. This, however, was surely too much to ask of him, and it was cause enough for gratitude that, though he was there before me, he was not a fellow-tourist with an opera-glass slung over his shoulder. There was support to my idea of the convent in the expiring light, for the scene was in its way unsurpassable. Directly below the terrace lay the deep- set circle of the Alban Lake, shining softly through the light mists of evening. This beautiful pool--it is hardly more-- occupies the crater of a prehistoric volcano, a perfect <b>cup,</b> <b>shaped</b> and smelted by furnace-fires. The rim of the cup, rising high and densely wooded round the placid stone-blue water, has a sort of natural artificiality. The sweep and contour of the long circle are admirable; never was a lake so charmingly lodged. It is said to be of extraordinary depth; and though stone-blue water seems at first a very innocent substitute for boiling lava, it has a sinister look which betrays its dangerous antecedents. The winds never reach it and its surface is never ruffled; but its deep-bosomed placidity seems to cover guilty secrets, and you fancy it in communication with the capricious and treacherous forces of nature. Its very colour is of a joyless beauty, a blue as cold and opaque as a solidified sheet of lava. Streaked and wrinkled by a mysterious motion of its own, it affects the very type of a legendary pool, and I could easily have believed that I had only to sit long enough into the evening to see the ghosts of classic nymphs and naiads cleave its sullen flood and beckon me with irresistible arms. Is it because its shores are haunted with these vague Pagan influences that two convents have risen there to purge the atmosphere? From the Capuchin terrace you look across at the grey Franciscan monastery of Palazzuola, which is not less romantic certainly than the most obstinate myth it may have exorcised. The Capuchin garden is a wild tangle of great trees and shrubs and clinging, trembling vines which in these hard days are left to take care of themselves; a weedy garden, if there ever was one, but none the less charming for that, in the deepening dusk, with its steep grassy vistas struggling away into impenetrable shadow. I braved the shadow for the sake of climbing upon certain little flat-roofed crumbling pavilions that rise from the corners of the further wall and give you a wider and lovelier view of lake and hills and sky.|$|E
