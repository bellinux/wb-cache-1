5|$|One {{particularly}} infamous oceanic whitetip was {{implicated in}} several bites on tourists in the Red Sea near Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, in 2010. This oceanic whitetip was recognized individually by the bite mark {{taken out of}} its upper tail lobe. Accumulating evidence revealed this shark to have been <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> being hand fed. Upon associating the divers with an easy supply of food, it bit the divers and snorkelers where it had seen the fish being kept; fanny packs the divers carried. This caused the shark to target the divers' buttock and thigh regions {{in the hope of}} obtaining a meal. The 2010 Sharm El Sheikh bites resulted in one death and four injuries to humans. The attacks might have been instigated by the overfishing in that area of the Red Sea, effectively forcing the shark closer to shore where the bites took place.|$|E
5|$|As the United States {{prepared}} to enter World War I in 1917, Du Bois's colleague in the NAACP, Joel Spingarn, established a camp to train African Americans {{to serve as}} officers in the United States military. The camp was controversial, because some whites felt that blacks were not qualified to be officers, and some blacks felt that African Americans should not participate in what they considered a white man's war. Du Bois supported Spingarn's training camp, but was disappointed when the Army forcibly retired one of its few black officers, Charles Young, on a pretense of ill health. The Army agreed to create 1,000 officer positions for blacks, but insisted that 250 come from enlisted men, <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> taking orders from whites, rather than from independent-minded blacks {{that came from the}} camp. Over 700,000 blacks enlisted {{on the first day of}} the draft, but were subject to discriminatory conditions which prompted vocal protests from Du Bois.|$|E

25|$|Using U0 126, {{researchers}} {{were able to}} selectively knock out a fear memory for a specific audio tone and leave a fear memory for another audio tone {{in a group of}} rats.

25|$|Sperm {{competition}} theory: Testosterone {{levels are}} shown {{to increase as}} a response to previously neutral stimuli when <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> become sexual in male rats. This reaction engages penile reflexes (such as erection and ejaculation) that aid in sperm competition when more than one male is present in mating encounters, allowing for more production of successful sperm and a higher chance of reproduction.|$|E
25|$|St. John was {{initially}} brought on as Todd Manning posing as character Walker Laurence. In 2011, with Howarth's return as Todd, the writers decided to rewrite this and instead have St. John's character revealed as Todd's identical twin brother, Victor Lord, Jr., <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> {{believe he was}} Todd and to thereby assume Todd's identity. This made it so that Todd never raped Marty for a second time.|$|E
25|$|The {{consolidation}} of memory requires the synthesis (creation) of certain proteins in the amygdala. Disruption of protein synthesis in the amygdala {{has been shown}} to prevent long-term memory for fear conditioning. Anisomycin inhibits the production of proteins. In tests where it is delivered to the lateral and basal nuclei in the amygdala of rats, the rats demonstrated that they had forgotten fear responses that they had been <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> display.|$|E
40|$|According to Jamie Whyte, {{the proper}} {{assignment}} of fulfillment <b>conditions</b> <b>to</b> an agent’s set of desires proceeds in three steps. First, one identifies various desire extinction and behavioural reinforcement <b>conditions</b> <b>to</b> obtain the fulfillment conditions {{of a certain}} subset of the agent’s desires. With these fulfillment conditions in hand, one then appeals to a principle connecting desire fulfillment conditions with belief truth <b>conditions</b> <b>to</b> obtain the truth conditions {{of a number of}} the agent’s beliefs. Finally, one uses these belief truth <b>conditions</b> <b>to</b> generate, via a third principle, the fulfillment conditions for the remaining desires. There is, however, a very straightforward reason why this strategy cannot yield the required results. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Coyotes {{occasionally}} {{lose their}} wariness {{of humans and}} frequent roadsides or developed areas, becoming <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> human food by receiving handouts or picking up food scraps. They can quickly learn bad habits like roadside begging behavior. This leads to potential danger for humans and coyotes. Several instances of coyote aggression toward humans {{have occurred in the}} park, including one that involved an actual attack. Habituation most likely played a role in this unusual coyote behavior.|$|E
25|$|People develop {{specific}} fears as {{a result}} of learning. This has been studied in psychology as fear conditioning, beginning with John B. Watson's Little Albert experiment in 1920, which was inspired after observing a child with an irrational fear of dogs. In this study, an 11-month-old boy was <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> fear a white rat in the laboratory. The fear became generalized to include other white, furry objects, such as a rabbit, dog, and even a ball of cotton.|$|E
25|$|Polynesia divides {{into two}} {{distinct}} cultural groups, East Polynesia and West Polynesia. The culture of West Polynesia is <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> high populations. It has strong institutions {{of marriage and}} well-developed judicial, monetary and trading traditions. It comprises the groups of Tonga, Niue, Samoa and extends to the atolls of Tuvalu to the north. The pattern of settlement that {{is believed to have}} occurred is that the Polynesians spread out from the Samoan Islands into the Tuvaluan atolls, with Tuvalu providing a stepping stone to migration into the Polynesian Outlier communities in Melanesia and Micronesia.|$|E

25|$|Studies on mice {{have shown}} that certain {{conditional}} fears can be inherited from either parent. In one example, mice were <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> fear a strong scent, acetophenone, by accompanying the smell with an electric shock. Consequently, the mice learned to fear the scent of acetophenone alone. It was discovered that this fear could be passed down to the mice offspring. Despite the offspring never experiencing the electric shock themselves the mice still display a fear of the acetophenone scent, because they inherited the fear epigenetically by site-specific DNA methylation. These epigenetic changes lasted up to two generations without reintroducing the shock.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, most {{historians and}} economists are <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> believe that {{steadily}} and sharply falling prices must result in depression: hence their amazement at the obvious prosperity {{and economic growth}} during this era. For they have overlooked {{the fact that in}} the natural course of events, when government and the banking system do not increase the money supply very rapidly, freemarket capitalism will result in an increase of production and economic growth so great as to swamp the increase of money supply. Prices will fall, and the consequences will be not depression or stagnation, but prosperity (since costs are falling, too), economic growth, and the spread of the increased living standard to all the consumers.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with OSA {{are rarely}} aware of {{difficulty}} breathing, even upon awakening. It is often {{recognized as a}} problem by others who observe the individual during episodes or is suspected because of its effects on the body. OSA is commonly accompanied with snoring. Some use the terms obstructive sleep apnea syndrome or obstructive sleep apnea–hypopnea syndrome to refer to OSA which is associated with symptoms during the daytime. Symptoms may be present for years or even decades without identification, during which time the individual may become <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> the daytime sleepiness and fatigue associated with significant levels of sleep disturbance. Individuals who generally sleep alone are often unaware of the condition, without a regular bed-partner to notice and make them aware of their symptoms.|$|E

40|$|We show that, {{when a group}} takes {{independent}} majority {{votes on}} interconnected propositions, the outcome is consistent once the profile of individual judgment sets respects appropriate structural conditions. We introduce several such conditions on profiles, based on ordering the propositions or ordering the individuals, and we clarify the relations between these conditions. By restricting the <b>conditions</b> <b>to</b> appropriate subagendas, we obtain local conditions that are less demanding but still guarantee consistent majority judgments. By applying the <b>conditions</b> <b>to</b> agendas representing preference aggregation problems, we show parallels of some <b>conditions</b> <b>to</b> existing social-choice-theoretic <b>conditions,</b> specifically <b>to</b> order restriction and intermediateness, restricted to triples of alternatives {{in the case of}} our local conditions. ...|$|R
25|$|Motivation is {{the driving}} force of desire behind all {{deliberate}} actions of humans. Motivation is based on emotion—specifically, on the search for satisfaction (positive emotional experiences), and the avoidance of conflict. Positive and negative is defined by the individual brain state, which may be influenced by social norms: a person may be driven to self-injury or violence because their brain is <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> create a positive response to these actions. Motivation is important because it is involved in the performance of all learned responses. Within psychology, conflict avoidance and the libido are seen to be primary motivators. Within economics, motivation is often seen to be based on incentives; these may be financial, moral, or coercive. Religions generally posit divine or demonic influences.|$|E
25|$|On July 18, in {{the evening}} some of the buffalo hunter's {{supplies}} consisting of alcohol were shared {{with some of the}} soldiers for a small price. Some of the sergeants not staying in the supply camp apparently partook. Later next day 40 of the 60 men of A Company set out for Cedar Lake, the sergeants failed to check that every soldier had filled their canteens. In the heat of the day, those that had been drinking the evening before were terribly parched and did not ration their water. Their example led many recruits to drain their canteens. The buffalo hunters carried more water than the soldiers knowing that the heat and weather would impact finding water. They also were <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> the heat and maintained a high level of water discipline.|$|E
25|$|Lincoln and Jordan find McCord, who {{explains}} {{that all the}} facility residents are clones of wealthy and/or desperate sponsors, who are kept ignorant about {{the real world and}} <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> never question their environment or history. McCord provides the name of Lincoln's sponsor in Los Angeles, and helps them to the Yucca maglev station, before mercenaries kill him. In New York, Jordan's sponsor, model Sarah Jordan, is comatose following a car crash and requires transplants from Jordan to survive. Lincoln's sponsor, Tom Lincoln, gives Lincoln some explanation about the cloning institute, causing Lincoln to realise that he has gained Tom's memories. Tom agrees to help Lincoln and Jordan but secretly contacts Merrick, who sends Laurent and the mercenaries to their location. Lincoln tricks Laurent into shooting Tom, allowing him to assume Tom's identity.|$|E
