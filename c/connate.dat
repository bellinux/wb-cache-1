5|$|Gynoecium : Superior ovary (hypogynous), syncarpous (with fused carpels), {{with three}} <b>connate</b> (fused) carpels and is trilocular (three locules, or chambers) or unilocular (single locule, as in Scoliopus and Medeola). There {{is a single}} style and a three lobed stigma or three stigmata more or less {{elongated}} along the style. There are numerous anatropous (curved) ovules which display axile placentation (parietal in Scoliopus and Medeola), usually with an integument and thinner megasporangium. The embryo sac (megagametophyte) varies by genera, but is mainly tetrasporic (e.g. Fritillaria). Embryo sacs in which {{three of the four}} megaspores fuse to form a triploid nucleus, are referred to as Fritillaria-type, a characteristic shared by all the core Liliales.|$|E

40|$|Expression of the cytokinin-synthesizing isopentenyl {{transferase}} enzyme {{under the}} control of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) SAG 12 senescence-inducible promoter reverses the normal abortion of the lower floret from a maize (Zea mays) spikelet. Following pollination, the upper and lower floret pistils fuse, producing a <b>connated</b> kernel with two genetically distinct embryos and the endosperms fused along their abgerminal face. Therefore, ectopic synthesis of cytokinin was used to position two independent endosperms within a <b>connated</b> kernel to determine how the fused endosperm would affect the development of the two aleurone layers along the fusion plane. Examination of the <b>connated</b> kernel revealed that aleurone cells were present for only a short distance along the fusion plane whereas starchy endosperm cells were present along most of the remainder of the fusion plane, suggesting that aleurone development is suppressed when positioned between independent starchy endosperms. Sporadic aleurone cells along the fusion plane were observed and may have arisen from late or imperfect fusion of the endosperms of the <b>connated</b> kernel, supporting the observation that a peripheral position at the surface of the endosperm and not proximity to maternal tissues such as the testa and pericarp are important for aleurone development. Aleurone mosaicism was observed in the crown region of nonconnated SAG 12 -isopentenyl transferase kernels, suggesting that cytokinin can also affect aleurone development...|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of six evergreen tree species in particular native to Vietnam, China, Peninsular Malaysia, and Borneo. They are dioecious. The leaves are opposite and the leave blade is 1-foliolate. The inflorescences can be axillary, thyrsoid or racemose. The four sepals are <b>connated</b> on the basis. The four petals are imbricated in the bud. The eight stamens are distinct. The opposite sepals {{are almost as}} long as the petals which are in male and in female flowers.|$|R
5000|$|Both genera have [...] upper premolars (W-shaped crests on the crowns), {{one of the}} {{characteristics}} of pantodonts, but their upper molars, unlike in later pantodonts, are almost [...] (V-shaped crests) and transversely elongated with the paracone and metacone (cusp) appressed or <b>connated.</b> On p3-M3, there is a large buccal platform on the crowns, the stylar shelf. An exterior indentation on the buccal side, the ectoflexus, is very deep. The lower cheek teeth are easily recognizable as pantodont.|$|R

25|$|The {{inflorescence}}s {{are long}} spikelike cymes or glomerules. Bracts can be leaflike (Beta macrorhiza) or very small, {{the upper half}} of the inflorescence often without bracts. The bisexual flowers consist of (3-) 5 basally <b>connate</b> perianth segments (either greenish, dorsally ridged and with hooded tips, or petaloid and whitish, yellowish, reddish, or greenish), 5 stamens, and a semi-inferior ovary with 2-3 (-5) stigmas.|$|E

The teaching capabilities of Murugan is found as one of his identifying features. The cult of Murugan is of pride to the Tamil people who identify six with Murugan <b>connating</b> six directions and six chakras in human anatomy.|$|R
40|$|The pollen {{grains of}} the Phyllanthus species of Mauritius and Réunion have been divided into seven pollen types. The {{different}} species and varieties of teh “phillyreifolius” group have close affinities {{and can be}} arranged in a continuous morphological series. All grains in this series are characterized by a two-layered or bi-reticulate ornamentation. They have a peripheral reticulum which consists of arch-like muri (in cross-section) and variform lumina and this covers an infra (micro-) reticulum, the structural units of which are <b>connated</b> with the muri of the suprareticulum. Contrary to earlier observations the Phyllanthus amarus type also shows a bi-reticulate ornamentation; this suggests a relationship between this type and the “phillyreifolius” group. The Phyllanthus maderaspatensis, P. casticum and P. tenellus types, however, have eu-reticulate ornamentation. The P. urinaria type resembles the P. amarus type, but its ornamentation is not clearly bi-reticulate and is better termed tectate-perforate. In the P. casticum type the pollen grains show very characteristic ectoapertures and they are of special interest as many Phyllanthus spp. occurring in Africa and Asia {{belong to the same}} type...|$|R
40|$|The general {{morphology}} and micromorphology of {{the flower}} in Polygonatum multiflorum, Maianthemum bifolium, and Convallaria majalis were studied using light microscopy methods. Among the studied species, P. multiflorum and C. majalis have syntepalous and trimerous flowers, and in M. bifolium flowers are the most reduced: they are dimerous, pentacyclic, and with free tepals. Only in P. multiflorum stamens are considerably adnate to the floral tube. The gynoecium of P. multiflorum consists of synascidiate, hemisymplicate, and asymplicate zones. In the gynoecium of M. bifolium and C. majalis, synascidiate, symplicate, and asymplicate vertical zones were revealed. In P. multiflorum and M. bifolium, the style is composed of postgenitally <b>connated</b> carpels, while in C. majalis the style is formed by congenitally fused carpels (symplicate gynoecium zone). A common pattern of the venation of the floral parts was revealed in all the species. The external flower morphology and the gynoecium inner structure are different in all three species, providing adaptations for the pollination mode. Attractive elements observed in the flower of P. multiflorum are the long septal nectary in the ovary and epidermal trichomes on the inner perigonium surface and on the filaments. In M. bifolium, a rudimentary external septal nectary was observed for the first time. No nectaries or other morphologically distinct secretory structures {{were found in the}} C. majalis flower, allowing considering the C. majalis flowers as pollen flowers...|$|R
25|$|In the {{photograph}} on the right, stages of flowering and fruit {{development in the}} noni or Indian mulberry (Morinda citrifolia) can be observed on a single branch. First an inflorescence of white flowers called a head is produced. After fertilization, each flower develops into a drupe, and as the drupes expand, they become <b>connate</b> (merge) into a multiple fleshy fruit called a syncarp.|$|E
25|$|The spike-like inflorescences {{consist of}} glomerules {{of one to}} three flowers sitting in the axils of leaf-like bracts. The free flowers are hermaphrodite. The {{perianth}} consists of five herbaceous, slightly keeled tepal lobes which are <b>connate</b> at base. There are five stamens opposite to the tepals, their filaments are fused at base forming a disc. The ovary is semi-inferior with 2 stigmas.|$|E
25|$|The Salicornia {{species are}} small annual herbs. They grow {{prostrate}} to erect, their simple or branched stems are succulent, glabrous, and apparently jointed. Older stems {{may be somewhat}} woody basally. The opposite leaves are fleshy, glabrous, sessile, basally <b>connate</b> and decurrent and enclosing the stem (thus forming the joints). The leaf blades are reduced to small collar-like scales with narrow scarious margin. Many species are green, but their foliage turns red in autumn.|$|E
25|$|The {{flowers are}} {{produced}} in dense spike-like, basally interrupted inflorescences. Very small flowers sit in one- to three- (rarely eight-) flowered glomerules in the axils of short bracts {{or in the}} upper half of the inflorescence without bracts. The hermaphrodite flowers are urn-shaped, green or tinged reddish, and consist of five basally <b>connate</b> perianth segments (tepals), 3-5 × 2–3mm, 5 stamens, and a semi-inferior ovary with 2-3 stigmas. The perianths of neighbouring flowers are often fused. Flowers are wind-pollinated.|$|E
25|$|All stems are {{terminating}} in spike-like apparently jointed inflorescences. Each joint {{consists of}} two opposite minute bracts with an (1-) 3-flowered cyme tightly embedded in cavities of the main axis and partly hidden by the bracts. The flowers are arranged in a triangle, both lateral flowers beneath the central flower. The hermaphrodite flowers {{are more or less}} radially symmetric, with a perianth of three fleshy tepals <b>connate</b> nearly to the apex. There are 1-2 stamens and an ovary with two stigmas.|$|E
25|$|Underside {{chocolate}} reddish brown, markings {{as on the}} upperside, but {{broader and}} slightly diffuse. Forewing with the discoidal streak and the triangular spot beyond it diffusely <b>connate</b> (united with others), some transverse linear white markings {{on either side of}} the postdiscal series of spots; the wing below vein 1 pale greyish brown. Hindwing: the discal and subterminal pale markings of the upperside represented by more clearly defined, very narrow, white bands, with, in the female, the addition of a terminal white similar band. Antennae black; head, thorax and abdomen fuliginous black; beneath dusky white.|$|E
25|$|Race hampsoni, Moore. Very closely allied to {{the typical}} form, but the {{markings}} pure white and broader in both seasonal forms, as in the race clinia. Upperside forewing: the spots of the discal series oval, outwardly rounded. Underside: ground colour dark ferruginous, the markings broad as on the upperside; the spots of the discal series, though closer to each other than in the typical form, still not <b>connate,</b> or forming an upper and lower band as in the race clinia. Recorded from the Nilgiris; Anaimalai Hills and Mysore.|$|E
25|$|The {{terminal}} or lateral inflorescences are spike-like, {{made up of}} joint-like segments {{with tiny}} paired cymes emerging from the joints. Each cyme consists of three (rarely five) flowers completely embedded between the bract and immersed in the fleshy tissue of the axis. The flowers of a cyme are arranged in a transverse row, the central flower separating the lateral flowers, with tissue of the axis between them. The hermaphrodite or unisexual flowers {{are more or less}} radially symmetric, with a perianth of three or four fleshy tepals <b>connate</b> nearly to the apex, one or two stamens, and an ovary with two or three stigmas.|$|E
2500|$|The {{species of}} Sarcocornia are {{perennial}} herbs, subshrubs or shrubs. They are taking an erect or prostrate, creeping form. The new stems are fleshy and divided into joint-like segments. Older stems are woody and not segmented. The oppositely arranged leaves are borne on fleshy, knobby petioles, their base decurrent and <b>connate</b> (thus forming the segments), the blades forming small, triangular tips with narrow scarious margin.|$|E
2500|$|Sedimentary {{rocks are}} often {{saturated}} with seawater or groundwater, in which minerals can dissolve, or from which minerals can precipitate. Precipitating minerals reduce the pore {{space in a}} rock, a process called cementation. Due to the decrease in pore space, the original <b>connate</b> fluids are expelled. The precipitated minerals form a cement and make the rock more compact and competent. In this way, loose clasts in a sedimentary rock can become [...] "glued" [...] together.|$|E
2500|$|As {{quoted by}} Eisler, both Hierosolymitanus and John of Damascus claim that [...] "the Jew Josephus" [...] {{described}} Christ as having had <b>connate</b> eyebrows with goodly eyes and being long-faced, crooked and well-grown. In {{a letter of}} certain bishops to the Emperor Theophilus, Christ's height is described as three cubits (four feet six), which was also the opinion of Ephrem Syrus (320–379 AD), [...] "God took human form and appeared {{in the form of}} three human ells (cubits); he came down to us small of stature." [...] Theodore of Mopsuhestia likewise claimed that the appearance of Christ was smaller than that of the children of Jacob (Israel).|$|E
2500|$|Lawrence's {{ideas on}} {{heredity}} were many {{years ahead of}} their time, as this extract shows: [...] "The offspring inherit only [...] <b>connate</b> peculiarities and not any of the acquired qualities". This is as clear a rejection of soft inheritance as one can find. However, Lawrence qualified it by including the origin of birth defects owing to influences on the mother (an old folk superstition). So Mayr places Wilhelm His, Sr. in 1874 as the first unqualified rejection of soft inheritance. However, the number of places in the text where Lawrence explicitly rejects the direct action of the environment on heredity justifies his recognition as an early opponent of Geoffroyism.|$|E
2500|$|D.sect.Aphragma was {{retained}} by George Bentham in his 1870 arrangement, {{making it the}} only one of Meissner's infrageneric taxa not to be discarded. However, Bentham reasoned that the single seed separator in D.sect.Eudryandra was formed by the joining together of the outer seed coat of each seed; and therefore both D.bipinnatifida, in which there appears to be two plates, and D.sect.Aphragma, in which there appears to be none, represent failure of the seed coats to join. On these grounds he transferred D.bipinnatifida into D.sect.Aphragma. Thus D.sect.Aphragma was redefined as containing those species in which [...] "Outer integuments of the two seeds not <b>connate</b> or readily separable from each other." [...] He also noted that the members of this section have large involucres with many broad bracts, giving them [...] "a different aspect from all others of the genus".|$|E
60|$|And {{what is said}} {{of their}} Refrangibility may be also {{understood}} of their Reflexibility, that is, of their Dispositions to be reflected, some at a greater, and others at a less thickness of thin Plates or Bubbles; namely, that those Dispositions are also <b>connate</b> with the Rays, and immutable; as may appear by the 13th, 14th, and 15th Observations, compared with the fourth and eighteenth.|$|E
60|$|V. I receive {{with full}} and {{grateful}} faith the assurance of revelation, that the Word, which is from all eternity with God, and is God, assumed our human nature {{in order to}} redeem me, and all mankind from this our <b>connate</b> corruption. My reason convinces me, that no other mode of redemption is conceivable, and, as did Socrates, would have yearned after the Redeemer, though it would not dare expect so wonderful an act of divine love, except only as an effort of my mind to conceive the utmost of the infinite greatness of that love.|$|E
60|$|It appears {{also that}} the unequal Refractions of difform Rays proceed not from any {{contingent}} irregularities; such as are Veins, an uneven Polish, or fortuitous Position of the Pores of Glass; unequal and casual Motions in the Air or Æther, the spreading, breaking, or dividing the same Ray into many diverging parts; or the like. For, admitting any such irregularities, {{it would be impossible}} for Refractions to render those Rings so very distinct, and well defined, as they do in the 24th Observation. It is necessary therefore that every Ray have its proper and constant degree of Refrangibility <b>connate</b> with it, according to which its refraction is ever justly and regularly perform'd; and that several Rays have several of those degrees.|$|E
60|$|At {{the same}} time there has been arising a {{co-ordinate}} species of government--that of Religion. As all ancient records and traditions prove, the earliest rulers are regarded as divine personages. The maxims and commands they uttered during their lives are held sacred after their deaths, and are enforced by their divinely-descended successors; who in their turns are promoted to the pantheon of the race, there to be worshipped and propitiated along with their predecessors: the most ancient of whom is the supreme god, and the rest subordinate gods. For a long time these <b>connate</b> forms of government--civil and religious--continue closely associated. For many generations the king continues to be the chief priest, and the priesthood to be members of the royal race. For many ages religious law continues to contain more or less of civil regulation, and civil law to possess more or less of religious sanction; and even among the most advanced nations these two controlling agencies are by no means completely differentiated from each other.|$|E
60|$|The Carrib {{mother who}} squeezes her child's head into a shape {{like that of}} the chief; the young savage who makes marks on himself similar to the scars carried by the warriors of his tribe (which is {{probably}} the origin of tattooing); the Highlander who adopts the plaid worn by the head of his clan; the courtiers who affect greyness, or limp, or cover their necks, in imitation of their king; and the people who ape the courtiers; are alike acting under a kind of government <b>connate</b> with that of Manners, and, like it too, primarily beneficial. For notwithstanding the numberless absurdities into which this copyism has led the people, from nose-rings to ear-rings, from painted faces to beauty-spots, from shaven heads to powdered wigs, from filed teeth and stained nails to bell-girdles, peaked shoes, and breeches stuffed with bran,--it must yet be concluded, that as the strong men, the successful men, the men of will, intelligence, and originality, who have got to the top, are, on the average, more likely to show judgment in their habits and tastes than the mass, the imitation of such is advantageous.|$|E
60|$|But farther; by the 24th Observation it appears, {{that there}} is a {{constant}} relation between Colours and Refrangibility; the most refrangible Rays being violet, the least refrangible red, and those of intermediate Colours having proportionably intermediate degrees of Refrangibility. And by the 13th, 14th, and 15th Observations, compared with the 4th or 18th there appears to be the same constant relation between Colour and Reflexibility; the violet being in like circumstances reflected at least thicknesses of any thin Plate or Bubble, the red at greatest thicknesses, and the intermediate Colours at intermediate thicknesses. Whence it follows, that the colorifick Dispositions of Rays are also <b>connate</b> with them, and immutable; and by consequence, that all the Productions and Appearances of Colours in the World are derived, not from any physical Change caused in Light by Refraction or Reflexion, but only from the various Mixtures or Separations of Rays, by virtue of their different Refrangibility or Reflexibility. And in this respect the Science of Colours becomes a Speculation as truly mathematical as any other part of Opticks. I mean, so far as they depend on the Nature of Light, and are not produced or alter'd by the Power of Imagination, or by striking or pressing the Eye.|$|E
6000|$|Further to {{illustrate}} this gradual depreciation of titles and to confirm the inference drawn, it may be well to notice in passing, that the oldest of them have, as might be expected, been depreciated to the greatest extent. Thus, Master--a word proved by its derivation and by the similarity of the <b>connate</b> words in other languages (Fr., maître for master; Russ., master: Dan., meester; Ger., meister) to {{have been one of}} the earliest in use for expressing lordship--has now become applicable to children only, and under the modification of [...] "Mister," [...] to persons next above the labourer. Again, knighthood, the oldest kind of dignity, is also the lowest; and Knight Bachelor, which is the lowest order of knighthood, is more ancient than any other of the orders. Similarly, too, with the peerage, Baron is alike the earliest and least elevated of its divisions. This continual degradation of all names of honour has, from time to time, made it requisite to introduce new ones having that distinguishing effect which the originals had lost by generality of use; just as our habit of misapplying superlatives has, by gradually destroying their force, entailed the need for fresh ones. And if, within the last thousand years, this process has produced effects thus marked, we may readily conceive how, during previous thousands, the titles of gods and demi-gods came to be used to all persons exercising power; as they have since come to be used to persons of respectability.|$|E
60|$|It may, perhaps, be {{maintained}} {{that there is}} no real difference between instincts and capacities, and it certainly is possible that they may pass into each other by insensible gradations. Still, practically, and in reference to our treatment of any intelligent nature which is in course of gradual development under our influence, the difference is wide. The dog has an instinct impelling him to attach himself to and follow his master; but he has no instinct leading him to draw his master's cart. He requires no teaching for the one. It comes, of course, from the <b>connate</b> impulses of his nature. For the other he requires a skillful and careful training. If we find a dog who evinces no disposition to seek the society of man, but roams off into woods and solitudes alone, he is useless, and we attribute the fault to his own wolfish nature. But if he will not fetch and carry at command, or bring home a basket in his mouth from market, the fault, if there be any fault, is in his master, in not having taken the proper time and pains to train him, or in not knowing how to do it. He has an instinct leading him to attach himself to a human master, and to follow his master wherever he goes. But he has no instinct leading him to fetch and carry, or to draw carts for any body. If he shows no affection for man, it is his own fault--that is, the fault of his nature. But if he does not fetch and carry well, or go out of the room when he is ordered out, or draw steadily in a cart, it is his teacher's fault. He has not been properly trained.|$|E
6000|$|The {{class of}} Vermes deposit a {{calcareous}} stuff, {{as if it}} had torn loose from the earth a piece of the gross mass which it must still drag about with it. In the insect class this residuum has refined itself. In the fishes and amphibia it is driven back or inward, the organic power begins to be intuitive, and sensibility appears. In the birds the bones have become hollow; while, with apparent proportional recess, but, in truth, by the excitement of the opposite pole, their exterior presents an actual vegetation. The bones of the mammalia are filled up, and their coverings have become more simple. Man possesses the most perfect osseous structure, the least and most insignificant covering. The whole force of organic power has attained an inward and centripetal direction. He has the whole world in counterpoint to him, but he contains an entire world within himself. Now, {{for the first time at}} the apex of the living pyramid, it is Man and Nature, but Man himself is a syllepsis, a compendium of Nature—the Microcosm! Naked and helpless cometh man into the world. Such has been the complaint from eldest time; but we complain of our chief privilege, our ornament, and the <b>connate</b> mark of our sovereignty. Porphyrigeniti sumus! In Man the centripetal and individualizing tendency of all Nature is itself concentred and individualized—he is a revelation of Nature! Henceforward, he is referred to himself, delivered up to his own charge; and he who stands the most on himself, and stands the firmest, is the truest, because the most individual, Man. In social and political life this acme is inter-dependence; in moral life it is independence; in intellectual life it is genius. Nor does the form of polarity, which has accompanied the law of individuation up its whole ascent, desert it here. As the height, so the depth. The intensities must be at once opposite and equal. As the liberty, so must be the reverence for law. As the independence, so must be the service and the submission to the Supreme Will! As the ideal genius and the originality, in the same proportion must be the resignation to the real world, the sympathy and the inter-communion with Nature. In the conciliating mid-point, or equator, does the Man live, and only by its equal presence in both its poles can that life be manifested! ...|$|E
60|$|We {{are often}} {{made to feel}} that there is another youth and age than that which is {{measured}} from the year of our natural birth. Some thoughts always find us young, and keep us so. Such a thought is the love of the universal and eternal beauty. Every man parts from that contemplation with the feeling that it rather belongs to ages than to mortal life. The least activity of the intellectual powers redeems us in a degree from the conditions of time. In sickness, in languor, give us a strain of poetry or a profound sentence, and we are refreshed; or produce a volume of Plato or Shakspeare, or remind us of their names, and instantly we come into a feeling of longevity. See how the deep divine thought reduces centuries and millenniums and makes itself present through all ages. Is the teaching of Christ less effective now than it was when first his mouth was opened? The emphasis of facts and persons in my thought {{has nothing to do with}} time. And so always the soul's scale is one, the scale of the senses and the understanding is another. Before the revelations of the soul, Time, Space and Nature shrink away. In common speech we refer all things to time, as we habitually refer the immensely sundered stars to one concave sphere. And so we say that the Judgment is distant or near, that the Millennium approaches, that a day of certain political, moral, social reforms is at hand, and the like, when we mean that in the nature of things one of the facts we contemplate is external and fugitive, and the other is permanent and <b>connate</b> with the soul. The things we now esteem fixed shall, one by one, detach themselves like ripe fruit from our experience, and fall. The wind shall blow them none knows whither. The landscape, the figures, Boston, London, are facts as fugitive as any institution past, or any whiff of mist or smoke, and so is society, and so is the world. The soul looketh steadily forwards, creating a world before her, leaving worlds behind her. She has no dates, nor rites, nor persons, nor specialties nor men. The soul knows only the soul; the web of events is the flowing robe in which she is clothed.|$|E
60|$|To speak truly, few adult persons can see nature. Most persons {{do not see}} the sun. At {{least they}} have a very {{superficial}} seeing. The sun illuminates only the eye of the man, but shines into the eye and the heart of the child. The lover of nature is he whose inward and outward senses are still truly adjusted to each other; who has retained the spirit of infancy even into the era of manhood. His intercourse with heaven and earth, becomes part of his daily food. In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real sorrows. Nature says,--he is my creature, and maugre all his impertinent griefs, he shall be glad with me. Not the sun or the summer alone, but every hour and season yields its tribute of delight; for every hour and change corresponds to and authorizes a different state of the mind, from breathless noon to grimmest midnight. Nature is a setting that fits equally well a comic or a mourning piece. In good health, the air is a cordial of incredible virtue. Crossing a bare common, in snow puddles, at twilight, under a clouded sky, without having in my thoughts any occurrence of special good fortune, I have enjoyed a perfect exhilaration. I am glad to the brink of fear. In the woods too, a man casts off his years, as the snake his slough, and at what period soever of life, is always a child. In the woods, is perpetual youth. Within these plantations of God, a decorum and sanctity reign, a perennial festival is dressed, and the guest sees not how he should tire of them in a thousand years. In the woods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life,--no disgrace, no calamity, (leaving me my eyes,) which nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare ground,--my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space,--all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle of God. The name of the nearest friend sounds then foreign and accidental: to be brothers, to be acquaintances, --master or servant, is then a trifle and a disturbance. I am the lover of uncontained and immortal beauty. In the wilderness, I find something more dear and <b>connate</b> than in streets or villages. In the tranquil landscape, and especially in the distant line of the horizon, man beholds somewhat as beautiful as his own nature.|$|E
