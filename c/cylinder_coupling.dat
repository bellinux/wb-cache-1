Previous experimental work has shown that beyond a critical flow velocity, characteristic deformation patterns can indeed be observed for square cylinder arrays in axial flow. This paper attempts to rewrite the physical problem in mathematical terms in which the fluid and <b>cylinder</b> <b>coupling</b> forces are modeled using influence coefficients. These coefficients are calculated and compared using two methods: simple potential flow and CFD including more complex turbulence modeling. The full static divergence problem is then numerically solved for an example system of a 10 x 10 cylinder arrays. Finally, {{the results for the}} divergence modes are visually presented and the intervening physical couplings are commented...|$|E

As locomotives got larger and more powerful, their reciprocating machinery had to get stronger and thus heavier, and thus the problems posed by imbalance and hammer blow became more severe. Higher speeds also increased unbalanced forces which rise with the square of the wheel rotational speed.|$|R
40|$|A novel Phoswich design {{based on}} new {{generation}} scintillator crystals is presented. The detector composed {{from a combination}} of a LaBr 3 (Ce) with a LaCl 3 (Ce) crystal in one <b>cylinder</b> <b>coupled</b> to a photo multiplier tube has been tested both for incident gamma rays in the range of 0. 3 – 6 MeV, as well as for high energy protons in the range 120 – 180 MeV. The Phoswich assembly has not significantly deteriorated the energy resolution, which for 662 KeV gamma rays gives a resolution of 4. 5 %, while for high energy protons (Ep= 180 MeV) an energy resolution of 1 % was obtained. It is shown that the signals from the two crystals can be separated in an event by event based mode. Using direct digitizing of the detector pulse an off-line pulse-shape analysis was performed built either on a total to tail or total to pulse height method in order to fully identify the incoming radiation.

Furthermore, we introduce a new gravitational theory which couples to the fermions by promoting the coadjoint vector of the diffeomorphism sector to a dynamical variable. This system, together with the gauge sector is shown to be equivalent to a one dimensional system. 1 The study of gauge theories both abelian (Ref. [1]) and non-abelian (Ref. [2, 3]) on a cylinder has been an issue in the literature for some time. The cylinder provides a toy manifold where one hopes to find insight into the more pressing 3 + 1 dimensional theories. In this note we will take a somewhat different view of fermions on a cylinder (or a plane) by examining the geometric actions that arise from the effective action of fermionic theories. Furthermore we promote the background gauge fields to propagating fields and discuss the analogue of this for gravity. We begin by considering the action S = d 2 x ¯ Ψiγ µ (∂µδij + qA ij µ) Ψj + d 2 x ¯ ΨiγµγνΨiT µν + 1 α F µν Fµνd 2 x, (11) where Ψ is a two component Dirac fermion and Aµ is a gauge field valued in the vector subalgebra of U(N) × U(N). The field T µν is a symmetric tensor that will serve as a background stress energy source. We define a mass term or Yukawa type coupling to the fermions through the trace of this tensor with the metric.

40|$|United States Pharmacopeia {{dissolution}} apparatus II (paddle) and III (reciprocating <b>cylinder)</b> <b>coupled</b> {{with automatic}} sampling devices and software {{were used to}} develop a testing procedure for acquiring release profiles of colon-specific drug delivery system (CODES™) drug formulations in multi-pH media using acetaminophen (APAP) as a model drug. System suitability was examined. Several important instrument parameters and formulation variables were evaluated. Release profiles in artificial gastric fluid (pH 1. 2), intestinal fluid (pH 6. 8), and pH 5. 0 buffer were determined. As expected, the percent release of APAP from coated core tablets was highly pH dependent. A release profile exhibiting a negligible release in pH 1. 2 and 6. 8 buffers followed by a rapid release in pH 5. 0 buffer was established. The drug release in pH 5. 0 buffer increased significantly {{with the increase in}} the dip or paddle speed but was inversely related to the screen mesh observed at lower dip speeds. It was interesting to note that there was a close similarity (f 2 = 80. 6) between the release profiles at dip speed 5 dpm and paddle speed 100 rpm. In addition, the release rate was reduced significantly with the increase in acid-soluble Eudragit E coating levels, but lactulose loading showed only a negligible effect. In conclusion, the established reciprocating cylinder method at lower agitation rates can give release profiles equivalent to those for the paddle procedure for CODES™ drug pH-gradient release testing. Apparatus III was demonstrated to be more convenient and efficient than apparatus II by providing various programmable options in sampling times, agitation rates, and medium changes, which suggested that the apparatus II approach has better potential for in vitro evaluation of colon-specific drug delivery systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{extends the}} use of the dynamic stiffness and transfer matrix methods in marine riser vibration. Marine risers possess a predominant chain topology. The transfer matrix method is appropriate for the analysis of such structures. Wave transmission and reflection matrices are formulated in terms of transfer-matrix elements. The delta-matrix method is introduced to deal with numerical problems associated with very long beams and high frequencies. The general internal relationships between the transfer matrix and dynamic stiffness methods are derived and applied to the problem of a non-uniform beam with discontinuities. An implicit transfer matrix of a general non-uniform beam is derived. The vibration analysis of non-uniform marine risers is addressed by combining the procedure of the dynamic stiffness method with the WKB theory. The WKB-based dynamic stiffness matrix is derived and the frequency-dependent shape function is expressed implicitly. The Wittrick-Williams algorithm is extended to the analysis of a general non-uniform marine riser, allowing automatic computation of natural frequencies. Marine riser models with complex boundary conditions are analyzed. The WKB-based dynamic stiffness method is improved and applied to a non-uniform beam system with discontinuities. A dynamic stiffness library is created. Dynamic vibration absorbers and wave-absorbing terminations are investigated as a means of suppressing vibration. The optimal tuning of multiple absorbers to a non-uniform beam system under varying tension is investigated. The properties of wave-absorbing terminations of a beam system are derived. The vibration of two concentric <b>cylinders</b> <b>coupled</b> by the annulus fluid and by periodic centralizers is modeled. The effects of coupling factors on vibration are numerically evaluated. It is shown that a properly designed inner tubular member may be used to damp the flow-induced vibration of the outer cylinder. by Weigang Chen. Thesis (Ph. D.)
