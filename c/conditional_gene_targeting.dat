The kinetic analysis of the reversibility of the miRNA mediated knockdown suggests that the recovery of <b>target</b> <b>gene</b> expression is primarily driven by cell division. Our miRNA design provides {{a useful tool for}} <b>conditional</b> <b>gene</b> inactivation in combination with the RNA-polymerase II based tet system. The identified characteristics of the conditional RNAi-mediated knockdown need to be considered for its application in cell culture or in vivo...|$|R
50|$|<b>Conditional</b> <b>gene</b> {{knockouts}} in mice {{are often}} used to study human diseases because many genes produce similar phenotypes in both species. The goal of KOMP is to create knockout mutations in the embryonic stem cells {{for each of the}} 20,000 protein coding genes in mice. The genes are knocked out because this {{is the best way to}} study their function and learn more about their role in human diseases. Some alleles in this project cannot be knocked out using traditional methods and require the specificity of the <b>conditional</b> <b>gene</b> knockout technique. Other combinatorial methods are needed to knockout the last remaining alleles. <b>Conditional</b> <b>gene</b> knockout is a time-consuming procedure and there are additional projects focusing on knocking out the remaining mouse genes. The KOMP projected was started in 2006 and is still ongoing.|$|R
50|$|The <b>conditional</b> <b>gene</b> {{knockout}} {{method is}} often used to model human diseases in other mammals. It has increased scientists’ ability to study diseases, such as cancer, that develop in specific cell types or developmental stages. It is known that mutations in the BRCA1 gene are linked to breast cancer. Scientists used <b>conditional</b> <b>gene</b> knockout to delete the BRCA1 allele in mammary gland tissue in mice and found that it {{plays an important role in}} tumour suppression.|$|R
