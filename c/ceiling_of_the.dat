5|$|The astronomical <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tomb of Senenmut (BC) {{contains}} the Celestial Diagram depicting circumpolar constellations {{in the form}} of discs. Each disc is divided into 24 sections suggesting a 24-hour time period. Constellations are portrayed as sacred deities of Egypt. The observation of lunar cycles is also evident.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} walls and <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall were richly decorated, {{in some cases}} with gaudy frescoes of the hills and Roman countryside, the Pantheons, religious themes, the buildings surrounding the area, and naval shipwrecks with Jesus calming the storm and so forth.|$|E
5|$|A great {{portion of}} the mosque is covered with whitewash, but the drum of the dome and the walls {{immediately}} beneath it are decorated with mosaics and marble. Some paintings by an Italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in 1927. The <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mosque was painted with funding by King Farouk of Egypt.|$|E
50|$|He later painted <b>the</b> {{walls and}} <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council Chambers at <b>the</b> League <b>of</b> Nations in Geneva.|$|R
50|$|From 2010 to 2015 {{restoration}} work in <b>the</b> interior <b>of</b> {{building will}} be undertaken to stabilize and restore <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two chambers.|$|R
50|$|All <b>the</b> {{walls and}} <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{interior}} were sheathed with narrow beaded board. The large, oversized windows allowed the two instructional rooms {{to take advantage}} of natural lighting.|$|R
5|$|Above {{the hall}} {{is a second}} hall, forming part of the Duchess' suite of rooms. An oratory in the south wall, {{overlooking}} the courtyard, contains a piscina and credence niche. The oratory gives access to mural passages leading to the walkway along the curtain wall. The timber <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Duchess' hall, and the timber floors and roof above, are of the 1880s. The upper parts of the stonework are among the repairs dating from 1580.|$|E
5|$|At Utica Avenue on the IND Fulton Street Line, a four-track station above {{can be seen}} in the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{existing}} station. This {{portion of}} the Utica Avenue Line was built with the construction of the Fulton Street Line. Ramps were built from the mezzanine to the platforms because the normal vertical distance of ten feet from the mezzanine floor to the platforms was increased to 25 feet in anticipation of the Utica Avenue Line. The existing mezzanine passes over the unused space.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of direct American involvement in World War II, the U.S. government bought the building and converted it to federal offices, officer billets, spaces used by the Army's Ordnance Procurement department, a passport agency and an induction center run by the local draft board. The high vaulted <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Hall worship center was hidden by a dropped ceiling. After the war, the Internal Revenue Service moved offices into the building.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> vaulted <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> palace were skillflly constructed, with {{sides of}} equal length unlike in other {{sites in the}} Petén region where <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> vaulted <b>ceilings</b> were often <b>of</b> {{different}} lengths. <b>The</b> vaulting is <b>of</b> exceptional height, reaching up to [...]|$|R
25|$|VAT {{reimbursement}} @80% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deposited {{amount for}} a period of 10 years with a <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> 300% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capital investment. Provisions for incentive even in zero VAT cases.|$|R
50|$|Born <b>the</b> son <b>of</b> an {{ornamental}} plasterer in the Charing Cross area of London, {{his father}} had sculpted <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Foundling Hospital there. His father wished {{him to be a}} civil engineer but he strongly desired to be a sculptor.|$|R
5|$|In January 2007, it was {{claimed that}} as many as 10,000 {{visitors}} passed through the Vatican Museums in a day and that the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sistine Chapel is the biggest attraction. The Vatican, anxious at the possibility that the newly restored frescoes will suffer damage, announced plans to reduce visiting hours and raise the price in an attempt to discourage visitors.|$|E
5|$|In June 1964, {{during a}} {{performance}} at the Railway, Townshend accidentally broke {{the head of his}} guitar on the low <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage. Angered by the audience's laughter, he smashed the instrument on the stage, then picked up another guitar and continued the show. The following week, the audience were keen to see a repeat of the event. Moon obliged by kicking his drum kit over, and auto-destructive art became a feature of the Who's live set.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s the central vault <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main {{sanctuary}} cracked, {{and had to}} be repaired. At that time the pulpit was also rebuilt, so that the rabbi and cantor had separate pulpits. Underneath the sanctuary ran an underground stream which would regularly overflow, leading to flooding problems. The flooding was fixed in the 1950s with the installation of check valves, and a concrete slab floor was installed. Though the intent was to provide usable space in the basement, it was rarely used.|$|E
50|$|From humble beginnings, <b>the</b> music {{community}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church strengthened {{and grown}} through the years. Today, the Church holds a Yamaha Electone STAGEA and a KORG Clavinova. A distinctive feature in Singapore is <b>the</b> high <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church which creates an acoustic hall ambience.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} the Sandrino dall’ Impruneta. He {{began his career as}} an {{assistant}} to Alessandro Allori. Allori led the team between 1587 and 1591, including Pieroni, Giovanni Bizelli, Giovanni Maria Butteri, and a young Cigoli in decorating <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corridors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Uffizi in Florence.|$|R
50|$|Frescos which adorned <b>the</b> apse <b>of</b> Södra Åsum {{church and}} <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> churches in Everlöv and Illstrop centuries ago have been slowly {{uncovered}} in recent years. Many similar churches had their ornamentation stripped and their paintings plastered over as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iconoclasm <b>of</b> Sweden's adoption of Lutheranism.|$|R
5|$|Some {{minor works}} {{took place during}} the {{remainder}} of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling. From 1988 to 2000, the two western towers were substantially overhauled with a viewing platform provided {{at the top of the}} north tower.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Mars as a wandering {{object in the}} night sky was recorded by ancient Egyptian astronomers. By the 2nd millennium BCE they were familiar with the apparent retrograde motion of the planet, in which it appears to move in the opposite direction across the sky from its normal progression. Mars was portrayed on the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tomb of Seti I, on the Ramesseum ceiling, and in the Senenmut star map. The last is the oldest known star map, being dated to 1534 BCE based on the position of the planets.|$|E
5|$|Burial 7 was interred in a cist {{under the}} central {{chamber of the}} Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). Although {{it had already been}} looted when it was {{discovered}} by archaeologists, the prior collapse of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> summit shrine of the pyramid protected a section of the tomb from the looters. The remains were those of an adult male with an artificially deformed skull; he was laid out on his back with a north-south orientation with the head towards the north. The funerary offering included three polychrome ceramics; a tripod plate, a plate painted with the figure of a dancer and a vessel bearing the images of human figures and a jaguar. Burial 7 was immediately above the cist of Burial 9.|$|E
50|$|He {{painted in}} {{conjunction}} with Morandi, Bonatti, and Romanelli; and executed an altar-piece in oil, and <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapels in fresco, for <b>the</b> church <b>of</b> Santa Maria dell' Anima in Rome. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paintings by him in Liege were destroyed when the French bombarded that town in 1691.|$|R
50|$|Built in {{the late}} Baroque style, the castle {{featured}} over 30 rooms and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finest examples <b>of</b> trompe-l'œil, particularly in the Grand Stair Hall. This and <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kaisersaal (Emperor Hall) and the Weißersaal (White Hall) were painted by Adam Friedrich Oeser, whom the Count commissioned in 1756.|$|R
50|$|Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{two towers}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate is a {{powerful}} block with a large portal and an open room upstairs. <b>The</b> two portals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> towers were used for freight transport. The monumental gate in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Propylaea was reserved for riders and city cars. <b>The</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> towers were coffered.|$|R
5|$|Cave 12 {{is a small}} {{dwelling}} {{entered by}} a door from the veranda of cave 11. It has its own open veranda, which has a partly broken floor and ceiling and recessed benches {{on the left and}} right of the door to the middle room. The middle room has a small window {{to the left of the}} door and a seat recess in its right wall. In the back wall of the middle room to the left is a half cell - which has a seat recess - and a cell with a grooved door. The floor of the cave has a coating of cement, while the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle room bears painted concentric circles.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a popular}} myth that {{so-called}} murder-holes– openings in the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gateway passage– were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; {{the price of oil}} and lead and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was impractical. This method was, however, a common practice in the MENA region and the Mediterranean castles and fortifications where such resources were abundant. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, or to allow water to be poured on fires to extinguish them. Provision was made in the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation so the gate was never left undefended, although this arrangement later evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of defence.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{from the}} south of the undercroft is the abbot's passage which dates from around 1150 and {{consists}} of two bays with rib-vaulting. Above the abbot's passage, approached by a stairway from the west cloister, is StAnselm's Chapel which also dates from the 12thcentury. It is in three bays and has a 19thcentury Gothic-style plaster vault. The chancel is in one bay and was remodelled in the early 17thcentury. The screen, altar rails, holy table and plaster <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chancel date from the 17thcentury. The north range of the cloister gives access to a refectory, built by Simon deWhitchurch in the 13thcentury. It contains an Early English pulpit, approached by a staircase with an ascending arcade. The only other similar pulpit in England is in Beaulieu Abbey.|$|E
25|$|In the Pagoda Room, {{there are}} portraits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cecil family, Elizabeth I, her father Henry VIII and Oliver Cromwell. Many delicately painted walls and <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house were done by Antonio Verrio. The Billiard Room {{displays}} six oval portraits <b>of</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Order <b>of</b> Little Bedlam, <b>the</b> 5th Earl’s drinking club.|$|R
25|$|A {{painting}} from this ship survives on <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> Commissioners House Chatham Dockyard, over the grand staircase. It depicts an assembly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gods and depicts Mars being crowned by Neptune, {{surrounded by the}} goddesses - Hope, Peace, Justice and Plenty. The painting {{is surrounded by a}} gilded frieze depicting sea creatures. It is attributed to James Thornhill - Sargeant Painter. He painted <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Hospital Greenwich and <b>the</b> Dome <b>of</b> Saint Paul's Cathedral.|$|R
25|$|The frescoes adorning {{the walls}} and <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nave were painted by Vatican painter and artist in {{residence}} Luigi Gregori. The ceilings are filled with a starry sky with angels, while {{the walls and}} transept are decorated with figures of saints. Gregori also painted <b>the</b> stations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cross that decorate <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main nave.|$|R
5|$|The European Parliament seat {{remained}} an issue throughout this period, despite the Council writing {{it into the}} treaties. During the 1990s, the issue was debated every year and in 1999, 250 MEPs signed a letter condemning the arrangement and the Strasbourg facilities. The following year Parliament voted 401 to 77 for a resolution demanding {{the right to decide}} its own working locations. Attempts to include this in the following treaties in 2000 and 2007 both failed. However, in September 2008 Parliament held its first full plenary session in Brussels after the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Strasbourg chamber collapsed during recess forcing the temporary move.|$|E
5|$|The Guests' Hall and its {{adjoining}} Porch Room {{occupy the}} space above {{the entrance to}} the courtyard and the Gatehouse. They can be accessed either through a doorway from the adjacent Prayer Room or via a staircase {{at the south end of}} the courtyard leading to the Long Gallery on the floor above. The first-floor landing leads to a passageway between the Guests' Hall and the Guests' Parlour, and to the garderobe tower visible from the front of the house. A doorway near {{the entrance to the}} Guests' Parlour allows access to the Brew-house Chamber, which is above the Brew-house. The Brew-house Chamber was probably built as servants' quarters, and originally accessed via a hatch in the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brew-house below.|$|E
5|$|The Sundial Room, {{also called}} the Meridian Hall, was once the {{residence}} of Queen Christina of Sweden, then newly converted to Catholicism. The room was further modified by two additions which gave it its current name: a sundial, and a delicate but sophisticated anemoscope which was fixed to the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Meridian Hall. These were created by Ignazio Danti, the papal cosmographer, {{in association with the}} Gregorian Calendar Reform. The sundial consisted of a straight line in white marble running across the floor in a north-south direction, intended to measure the height of the Sun at noon according to the seasons of the year.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burial {{chambers}} were decorated (from <b>the</b> burial <b>of</b> Seti I onwards) {{with what}} became [...] formalised as <b>the</b> Book <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Heavens, which again describes the sun's journey through <b>the</b> twelve hours <b>of</b> night. Again from Seti I's time, <b>the</b> Litany <b>of</b> Re, a lengthy hymn {{to the sun}} god began to appear.|$|R
50|$|Between 1565 and 1567, {{and again}} from 1575 to 1588, Tintoretto {{produced}} {{a large number}} <b>of</b> paintings for <b>the</b> walls and <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scuola Grande di San Rocco. The building, begun in 1525, was very deficient in light and thus ill-suited for any great scheme <b>of</b> pictorial adornment. <b>The</b> painting <b>of</b> its interior commenced in 1560.|$|R
50|$|Chiktan Castle {{is located}} deep inside a valley, by the Indus river, with the {{mountains}} in the background. It is composed of rammed earth and stone masonry with mud mortar. Following <b>the</b> designs <b>of</b> architect and carpenter Shinkhen Chandan, the castle used timber to support <b>the</b> <b>ceilings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure {{as well as to}} frame the doors and windows.|$|R
