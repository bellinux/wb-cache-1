50|$|The Bonn Agreement of December 2001 {{required}} Afghanistan {{to draft}} and adopt {{a new constitution}} within 2 years. In October 2002, Interim President Hamid Karzai appointed a nine-member Constitutional Drafting Commission, chaired by then Vice-President Nematullah Shahrani. Over the next six months, this body drafted a new constitution, based largely on the 1964 Afghan constitution. The initial draft, written primarily by Abdul Salam Azimi (who would become Chief Justice of Afghanistan's Supreme Court in 2006) was not the subject of in-depth political consultation. In April 2003, Interim President Karzai passed a decree appointing a new 35-member Constitutional Commission and laying out a public consultation process. This commission travelled widely {{throughout the country and}} reworked the draft, which was not released to the public until November 2003, only weeks before the <b>Constitutional</b> Convention (<b>Loya</b> <b>Jirga)</b> was scheduled to begin. This process was supported by several international institutions that provided funding, mostly through the UN, and expertise.|$|R

50|$|The Pasthun {{element in}} the Transitional {{administration}} was stronger than in the interim administration and the <b>loya</b> <b>jirga</b> was meant in part to increase civilian influence in the government. However, in many ways Afghanistan’s military factions and warlords increased and further legitimized their power during the <b>loya</b> <b>jirga.</b> During and after the <b>loya</b> <b>jirga,</b> army and police officials threatened, imprisoned, and even killed candidates {{to stop them from}} running for the <b>loya</b> <b>jirga,</b> or to intimidate them from acting independently The Northern Alliance still dominated the government. The three vice-presidents Karzai announced on the <b>Loya</b> <b>Jirga,</b> Khalili, Qadir and Fahim were all Northern Alliance commanders, although none of them had the same ethnic background. The powerful Tajik Jamiat-e Islami trio Fahim, Qanuni and Abdullah kept important positions in the new cabinet.|$|R
