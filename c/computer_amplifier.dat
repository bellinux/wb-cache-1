40|$|The {{exposure}} of an organism to a toxicant {{is defined by}} the magnitude, duration, and frequency with which the organism(s) interact with the toxicant(s). Predicting the {{exposure of}} organisms to toxicants during episodic events such as those resulting from storm water runoff is very difficult. The research reported here describes a non-invasive, or minimally invasive, system that measures in real-time or near real-time, clam gape. Clams have been shown to change gape in the presence of toxicants i. e., they "clam up". The organism used in the development of this system was the Asiatic clam (Corbicula fluminea). A marine bivalve (Brachidontes recurva) was used when the monitoring system was deployed in a marine environment. The major components of the system include industrial proximity sensors, single board <b>computer,</b> <b>amplifier,</b> wireless transceiver, and in remote applications solar generated electrical power. Clam gape and physical/chemical data are transmitted in real-time, or near real-time, to a central laboratory. In addition, when a toxic event is detected the system is designed to initiate water samplers while notifying the central location that an event has occurred. Water samples collected during an event can be verified for toxicity, and the chemicals causing toxicity identified using toxicity identification techniques. We are continuing to perform experiments to identify those changes in clam gape that can be used as triggers to distinguish toxic events from non-toxic events. If these experiments are successful the deployment of remote biosensors as part of watershed management schemes should help identify toxicants causing problems and lead to management strategies to minimize their impact...|$|E

With the computer track and the central having target position, A/C heading, & bomb type information; and with the Bomb Trajectory Group's servos tracking the bomb-in-aircraft course and pitch, the operator then activated the BTG integrators for the computer simulation to begin integrating a bomb trajectory from the A/C coordinates at that integration start point.

Fiber amplifiers such as the erbium-doped fiber amplifier have revolutionized the fiber-optics industry and are enjoying widespread use. Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) are an alternative technology that complements the fiber amplifiers in cost and performance. One obstacle to {{the widespread use of}} SOAs is the severity of the inevitable noise output resulting from amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). Spectral filtering is often used to reduce ASE noise, but this constrains the source spectrally, and improvement is typically limited to about 10 dB.

The goal of this project was to analyze, design, and take significant steps toward the realization of an innovative, low-noise SOA based on the concept of ''distributed spatial filtering'' (DSF). In DSF, we alternate active SOA segments with passive free-space diffraction regions. Since spontaneous emission radiates equally in all directions, the free-space region lengthens the amplifier for a given length of gain region, narrowing the solid angle into which the spontaneous emission is amplified [1, 2]. Our innovation is to use spatial filtering in a differential manner across many segments, thereby enhancing the effect when wave-optical effects are included [3].
