The basic idea of identifying a subject based {{on a set of}} features left by the subject actions or behavior can be applied to other domains. Identifying a mobile phone user based on a user fingerprint is one such application. This paper considers the problem of extracting fingerprints from call usage logs and matching them with those obtained from a set of known users. It presents an innovative fuzzy fingerprint algorithm based on vector valued fuzzy sets. <b>Call</b> <b>destination</b> numbers are used as base features to create the fingerprint. The assumption is that numbers called by each user remain approximately stable and are distinctive. The paper presents the proposed algorithm and shows some experimental results that validate the approach. The use of fast and compact algorithms is critical due to the possible huge number of users, and allows this method to be used on near real time...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{complexity}} of cellular mobile systems renders prevention-based techniques not adequate {{to guard against}} all potential attacks. An intrusion detection system has become an indispensable component to provide defense-in-depth security mechanisms for wireless networks. In this paper, by exploiting regularities demonstrated in users ’ behaviors, we present a suite of detection techniques to identify fraudulent usage of mobile telecommunication services. Specifically, we explore users ’ behav-iors in terms of calling and mobility activities because they {{are two of the}} most important components of mobile users ’ profiles. To utilize users ’ calling activities, we formulate the intrusion de-tection problem as a multifeature two-class pattern-classification problem. Parameters including call-duration time, call inactivity period, and <b>call</b> <b>destination</b> are extracted to form a feature vector to reflect users ’ calling activities. A nonparametric technique known as the Parzen window with a Gaussian kernel, is used to estimate a class-conditional probability density function. A Bayesian decision rule is applied in order to achieve a desirable error rate. To effectively exploit movement patterns demonstrated by mobile users, we first propose a realistic network model inte-grating geographic road-level granularities. Based on this model, an instance-based learning technique is presented to construct mobile users ’ movement patterns. A user’s movement history is stored and compared against newly observed movement instances. We then define a novel similarity threshold to classify users’ current movement activities. We simulate users ’ various behaviors and provide simulation results. Index Terms—Bayesian decision rule, instance-based learning (IBL), intrusion detection, wireless network. I...|$|E
