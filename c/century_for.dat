5|$|A {{saturated}} solution of equal parts of thallium(I) formate (Tl(CHO2)) and thallium(I) malonate (Tl(C3H3O4)) in water {{is known as}} Clerici solution. It is a mobile, odorless liquid which changes from yellowish to colourless upon reducing the concentration of the thallium salts. With a density of 4.25g/cm3 at 20°C, Clerici solution {{is one of the}} heaviest aqueous solutions known. It was used in the 20th <b>century</b> <b>for</b> measuring the density of minerals by the flotation method, but its use has discontinued due to the high toxicity and corrosiveness of the solution.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 14 in 1904, Kilner {{reached the}} Mitchell Main first team. Although {{selected}} regularly from 1905, Kilner was not particularly successful with the bat. He displayed aggression but often attempted difficult shots and consequently lost his wicket. His bowling was more effective but used infrequently. By 1909 his batting improved; he scored his first <b>century</b> <b>for</b> the team and began to make consistently good scores, attracting the attention of Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Bajana {{appeared}} {{less frequently}} for Somerset in 1913, playing ten matches for the county. He only scored one half-century, accruing 78 runs against Derbyshire. His batting average of 19.75 in 1913 placed him {{fourth in the}} Somerset batting averages. He did not play for Somerset in 1914, and {{the outbreak of the}} First World War suspended county cricket until 1919. During the war Bajana played, and captained, a number of matches for the Indian Gymkhana Cricket Club, and scored a <b>century</b> <b>for</b> the team against a New Zealand APS side in 1918.|$|E

5|$|Franklin's {{electrostatic}} {{machine is}} a high-voltage static electricity generating device used by Benjamin Franklin in the mid-eighteenth <b>century</b> <b>for</b> research into electrical phenomena. Its key components are a glass globe which turned on an axis via a crank; a cloth pad {{in contact with}} the spinning globe; a set of metal needles to conduct away the charge developed on the globe by its friction with the pad; and a Leyden jara high-voltage capacitorto accumulate the charge. Franklin's experiments with the machine eventually led to new theories about electricity and inventing the lightning rod.|$|E

Yeshe-Ö and his two sons when they built the monastery in 996 AD blended the provincial and regional characteristics with that of India and Central Asia. One particular feature mentioned {{in this regard is}} the iconographic themes of non-Buddhist traditions emanating from the protectress deity Wi-nyu-myin.

5|$|Much {{uncertainty}} remains, especially {{regarding the}} size of limitanei regiments, {{as can be seen}} by the wide ranges of the size estimates.

The resulting units may have been just half the strength of the parent units (unless a major recruitment drive was held to bring them all up to original strength).|$|E
