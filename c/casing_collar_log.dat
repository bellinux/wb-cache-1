50|$|Wireline {{tools are}} {{specially}} designed instruments lowered into a well bore {{on the end}} of the wireline cable. They are individually designed to provide any number of particular services, such as evaluation of the rock properties, the location of <b>casing</b> <b>collars,</b> formation pressures, information regarding the pore size or fluid identification and sample recovery. Modern wireline tools can be extremely complicated, and are often engineered to withstand very harsh conditions such as those found in many modern oil, gas, and geothermal wells. Pressures in gas wells can exceed 30,000 psi, while temperatures can exceed 500 deg Fahrenheit in some geothermal wells. Corrosive or carcinogenic gases such as hydrogen sulfide can also occur downhole.|$|R

40|$|Steel casing {{corrosion}} {{analysis is}} pivotal in well integrity evaluation for ensuring environment-friendly and efficient hydrocarbon production and for well abandonment {{at the end}} of the productive life of the well. Due to their sensitivity to metal loss and depth of investigation, low frequency electromagnetics (EM) based corrosion measurements have long been considered as viable non-destructive diagnostic means. For nested multi-casing evaluation, the quantitative data inversion and analysis requires a thorough understanding and modeling of the underlying measurement physics. We propose a model-based parametric inversion methodology for quantitative evaluation of multiple nested casings using multi-spacing and multi-frequency induction measurements, to determine effective thicknesses of individual pipes and take into account variations in casing conductivity and permeabilities. Axi-symmetric finite-element forward modeling is used in the inversion loop to match the tool responses allowing us to include the sensor details in the model. The presence of <b>casing</b> <b>collars</b> and ubiquitous eccentering of individual casings affects the tool responses and reduce the effectiveness of elementary interpretation schemes (often based on remote field eddy current concept and aimed primarily at providing the total metal loss). To quantify the effect of casing and measurement tool eccentering, we performed comprehensive 3 - D finite-element modeling. The sensitivity and data resolution analysis is used to evaluate individual measurement importance and optimize the inversion based methodology. The workflow is capable of handling arbitrary number of nested casings and raises a QC flag for eccentered casings based on the reconstruction quality of short spacing measurements. Model covariance matrix from the inversion is used to quantify the inverted parameter uncertainty while the extended data resolution matrix concept is applied to extract information about the measurement channel reconstruction. The proposed methodology has been successfully validated on synthetic data and lab measurements...|$|R
30|$|A {{critical}} challenge {{confronting the}} commercial utilization of supercritical geothermal systems {{is the need}} for drilling systems, well completion methods, power plants, logging tools, and characterization methods that can withstand high temperatures and aggressive fluids. Several European Commission funded projects addressed and are currently addressing these issues. The HiTI project (High Temperature Instruments for supercritical geothermal reservoir characterization and exploitation) focused on developing high-temperature tools and methods (Ásmundsson et al. 2014; Sanjuan et al. 2010). This work focused on the development and testing of a high-temperature distributed temperature sensing (DTS) cable (Reinsch and Henninges 2010; Reinsch et al. 2013) and a wireline temperature tool, the MultiSensor memory tool that records temperature, pressure, fluid flow and <b>casing</b> <b>collar</b> locations, high-temperature borehole televiewer and resistivity logging tools, and new Na/Li geothermometers (Sanjuan et al. 2010, 2014), and high-temperature tracers (Gadalia et al. 2010; Juliusson et al. 2015). The DESCRAMBLE project developed a slick-line temperature and pressure logging tool by SINTEF that can withstand downhole conditions of 450  °C and 450  bar for up to 8 h. The IMAGE (Integrated Methods for Advanced Geothermal Exploration) initiative {{led to the development of}} new seismic and electromagnetic investigation methods for characterizing supercritical systems (van Wees et al. 2015), and these methods have been employed at the IDDP sites in Iceland. One approach involves adaption the seismic-while-drilling method to geothermal systems (Poletto et al. 2011 a,b). In addition, new laboratory set-ups were developed to investigate rock properties at supercritical conditions (e.g., Kummerow and Raab 2015 a, b). The objective of the GeoWell project is to develop reliable, cost-effective, and environmentally safe well completion and monitoring technologies to accelerate the development of geothermal resources for power generation in Europe and worldwide. These technologies were deployed in traditional production wells as well as deeper wells, where the pressure may be as high as 150  bar and temperature can exceed 400  °C. These technologies include all aspects of the well completion process, such as optimization of cementing and sealing procedures, selection of materials and coupling of casings, temperature and strain measurements in wells using fiber optic technologies to monitor well integrity, and development of risk-assessment methods.|$|R
50|$|Casing collar locator tools, or CCL's, {{are among}} the {{simplest}} and most essential in cased hole electric line.

Two magnets are separated by a coil of copper wire. As the CCL passes by a <b>casing</b> joint, or <b>collar,</b> the difference in metal thickness across the two magnets induces a current spike in the coil.

In order to precisely place the cement slurry at a required interval on the outside of the casing, a plug is pumped with a displacement fluid behind the cement slurry column, which [...] "bumps" [...] in the casing shoe and prevents further flow of fluid through the shoe.

40|$|Cattle are {{a highly}} gregarious species that form strong social connections. Social support {{following}} calvingserves to increase offspring survival and conception {{rates for the}} following breeding season. It has beenshown that cattle change their association preferences following calving, but the correlation between social association and postpartum age class has not been explored. This study investigated the effect of postpartum age on association strength based {{on the amount of}} time pairs of individuals spent within close proximity as recorded by proximity <b>logging</b> <b>collars.</b> The associations of 58 mixed breed cattle werere corded over an 11 week period and associations analyzed within and between three maternal classes: maternal (calved prior {{to the beginning of the}} trial), pregnant and calved during the trial. There was a clear distinction in the association preferences between the maternal and pregnant cows: both cow classes associated more within their own maternal status than between statuses (maternal 181. 47 s, pregnant 141. 48 s, between groups 91. 62 s, P < 0. 001). Network analyzes showed both between and within group preferences for the two groups, with some individuals playing a prominent social role in connectingthe groups together. The cows that calved during the study showed an immediate change in association preference from the pregnant to the maternal group following parturition. The effect of this was correlated with age of calf; newly maternal cows preferentially associated with cows that had calves of a similar age. This study demonstrates that maternal status is an important determinant of association preference. The change in association patterns once a pregnant cow calves and the strong dyadic relationships between newly calved cows supports the notion that an offspring at foot might provide a motivation for reciprocit...|$|R
40|$|Information on {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of ewes was obtained by deploying GPS collars on sheep on a commercial property on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify the relationship between local weather, topography and use of shade and shelter by sheep in 2 paddocks of 20 ha. Paddock A was characterised by 3 distinct areas: "exterior shelter" consisting of perimeter shelter belts (3 – 4 rows of native trees), "lone trees" consisting of individual free-standing trees within the paddock, and "remainder of paddock". Paddock B contained areas that were categorised as for paddock A, plus an "interior shelter", a single, internal boomerang-shaped shelter belt. Over 2 lambing seasons (spring 2008 and 2009, 43 – 51 days), a random sample of 5 ewes from each of the 2 flocks of 200 – 300 ewes (2 – 5 years old and shorn 2 weeks prior to commencement of the experiment) were fitted with GPS <b>collars</b> set to <b>log</b> position every 10 min. Four weather stations and 55 temperature loggers were strategically located throughout the paddocks to provide localized hourly measurements of temperature, wind speed and precipitation over the observation periods. Daily temperatures ranged between – 6 °C and 27 °C; nights were generally still and frost was common; days were often sunny and windy. Wind speed reached a mean maximum of 49. 6 km/h. Strong westerly winds prevailed; northerly and southerly winds were unusual. The average rainfall during the observation period was 760 mm. As the number of times that sheep were detected in the various paddock categories was similar in each year, data for the 2 years were combined. The percentage of observations in which sheep were within 25 m of each shelter class was determined during 3 key phases of the diurnal behavioural cycle: 19 : 00 – 04 : 00 (night camping); 05 : 00 – 11 : 00 (morning grazing) and 12 : 00 – 18 : 00 (afternoon grazing). During night camping and when an internal shelter belt was provided (Paddock B), sheep spent more time in the vicinity (0 – 25 m) of the interior shelter belt (56...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 - 12 Feral cats (Felis catus) {{have been}} shown to be a main {{contributor}} to species decline throughout the world and are especially threatening to insular species that lack adequate defense characteristics. Feral cat control programs have been implemented on islands throughout the world with varied success. Many islands present unique limitations and therefore require custom control strategies. Furthermore, the adaptive nature of feral cat populations makes it difficult to predict space use and the effect of control on population size. To mitigate the impact of feral cats on threatened species, space use data are commonly used to design control strategies. With the use of GPS data <b>logging</b> <b>collars,</b> chapter two describes daily space use and home ranges of feral cats that threaten an endangered species on Rota Island in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Using 100 % Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP), average adult male home range was 1. 32 km² and average adult female home range was 0. 22 km². Home ranges were deemed fully revealed if asymptotes were reached using incremental analysis. A Michaelis-Menten model was applied to predict home ranges of cats with datasets that did not show convergence. The ability of the model to estimate home ranges of cats with limited location datasets was evaluated by comparing predictions derived from truncations of the full time series of complete datasets. Findings suggest that cat management on Rota should be multifaceted in order to maximize the protection of endangered species and that the Michaelis-Menten model is a useful tool for home range analysis. Chapter three examines the Rota hunting strategy to determine its impacts on the population. A discrete form of the Schaefer model was applied to a 29 -month time series of control data. A likelihood framework was used to determine maximum likelihood parameter estimates and calculate population projections to compare control strategies. Model results suggest that the hunting strategy on Rota was effective at initially reducing the cat population, however an unfeasible amount of effort would be required to maintain such a rate of decline. Findings show that it is feasible to maintain cat abundance at lower levels and suggest that a concentrated-effort strategy is preferable to a fixed-effort strategy. While more complex population model forms are available, the Schaefer model is well suited for assessing the impacts of limited predator control programs, such as the one conducted on Rota Island...|$|R
3000|$|Several {{studies on}} logging damage have {{highlighted}} {{that a number}} of factors affect the susceptibility to and effect of mechanical injury. These include the following: tree species (Bettinger and Kellogg 1993; Vasiliauskas 2001), silvicultural treatment (Bettinger et al. 1998), logging season (Limbeck-Lilienau 2003), logging methods (Bragg et al. 1994; Spinelli et al. 2010; Marchi et al. 2014), harvesting system (Han and Kellogg 2000), site characteristics (Sist et al. 2003), amount of timber removed during harvest (Fjeld and Granhus 1998; [...] Gullison and Hardner 1993), design of the extraction trails (Gullison and Hardner 1993), and skill of the personnel operating the equipment (Wallentin 2007; Nikooy et al. 2010). The effect of damage on tree growth has been also investigated showing contrasting results. Some studies clearly indicated that growth losses occur in damaged trees, and in some cases, these can seriously offset the gains from harvesting (Vasiliauskas 2001). Shea (1961) recorded a reduction in diameter growth in injured Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb) Franco). Isomäki and Kallio (1974) verified a decrease by 35 – 40  % in both radial and height growth in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) trees with root <b>collar</b> damage following <b>logging</b> and a 15  % reduced growth due to stem damage. Other studies showed stem wounds in Norway spruce may result in growth rate losses ranging from 14 to 25  % (Baader 1956; Vanek 1957). In contrast, Vasiliauskas and Stenlid (2007) recorded an increase in radial growth in injured stems of ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.). Finally, a number of investigations failed to reveal any significant effect of stem wounds on the increment of Norway spruce (Vasiliauskas 1994), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Srag.) (Shea 1961), oak (Quercus robur L.) (Vasiliauskas 1998) and Corsican pine Pinus nigra subsp. salzmanniivar. corsicana (Loudon) Hylander (as Pinus laricio Poiret) (Picchio et al. 2011). It is difficult, therefore, to make a general conclusion on what effect mechanical stem damage has on tree growth (Vasiliauskas 2001). Also, most of the studies on this topic are quite dated, mainly related to conifer species and, most importantly, approach the effect of damage on tree growth taking into consideration the effect of damage caused by animals rather than logging. Studies on this topic are still limited, especially in broadleaved stands, and the long-term effects of damage are not well known (Mäkinen et al. 2007). In order to improve logging methods, a better knowledge about the long-term impact of forest operations is needed (Whitman et al. 1997; Tavankar and Bonyad 2014).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Study One - Our {{objective}} was to characterize mature range cows based on intake and grazing activity. Starting {{in the early spring}} of 2013, 4 experiments were conducted. First, mature range cows (n = 137) were fitted with radio frequency identification tags (RFID) and placed in a dry-lot pen equipped with GrowSafe® technology to monitor DMI of alfalfa hay. These data were then used to assign cows a residual feed intake (RFI) value utilizing the National Research Council (NRC) (1996) model to predict intake of beef cattle. Cattle with negative and positive RFI were characterized as low-intake and high-intake, respectively. In addition, the following data were also recorded: weight (kg), age (mo), days pregnant (d), and body condition score (BCS). Second, 30 mature range cattle were selected from the first trial and fitted with pedometers for 7 d to monitor activity with step counts and estimate distance traveled. Third, mature range cows (n = 25) selected from the first trial were fitted with global position system (GPS) collars, and placed on pinyon-juniper rangeland from 20 June 2014 to 17 September 2014. Forth, mature range cows (n = 28) were fitted with GPS collars, and placed on ponderosa pine rangeland from 17 September 2014 to 15 October 2014. Distance traveled, slope, distance from water, elevation data were collected from both GPS trials. Low-intake and high-intake cows consumed 9. 3 and 12. 2 kg/d, respectively (P 0. 06). Step counts for low- and high-intake animals were 5839 and 5383 ± 2089, respectively (P = 0. 61), and estimated distance traveled was 4. 31 and 5. 35 ± 1. 66 km d⁻¹ for low- and high-intake animals, respectively (P = 0. 77). Low-intake cows (6. 23 km d⁻¹) traveled farther (P = 0. 005) each day than high-intake cows (5. 84 km d⁻¹) on pinyon-juniper rangelands, and high-intake cows utilized (P = 0. 013) steeper slopes. No differences were detected (P ≥ 0. 06) for distance traveled, distance from water, and elevation for cows grazing ponderosa pine rangeland). However, low-intake cattle preferred (P = 0. 046) steeper slopes on ponderosa pine rangeland than high-intake cattle. These results indicate that low-intake animals may travel farther on some rangelands and rebreed earlier. Study Two - Commercial grade heifers (n = 173) born and raised on the University of Arizona's V bar V Ranch from 2012 to 2014 were fitted with radio frequency identification tags (RFID) and placed in a drylot equipped with Growsafe® technology (8 bunks) for 60 d in 3 groups based on birth year in order to calculate DMI, residual feed intake (RFI), ADG, G:F, and residual gain (RG). Birth date, birth weight, weaning weight, age at start of trial, initial trial weight, and final trial weights were also recorded. Residual feed intake scores were utilized to place heifers in one of three treatment groups, low-, medium-, and high-intake. Reproductive and calf data were collected on heifers born in 2012. Means for birth date, birth weight, weaning weight, initial weight, final weight, and ADG did not differ among the three treatments. Residual gain for low-, medium-, and high-intake heifers were different (P 0. 05), respectively. Differences (P 0. 05). Study Three - Commercially available GPS tracking collars for cattle are cost prohibitive to most researchers. This paper will present a low-cost alternative to those collars (Knight GPS tracking collars), and provide detailed instructions on where to source materials and how to fabricate inexpensive GPS tracking collars. In addition, the two types of collars will be compared in a study where Brangus cattle (n = 8) were each fitted with LOTEK® 3300 and Knight GPS tracking collars for 31 d beginning 14 March 2015 at the Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) 37 km north of Las Cruces, New Mexico. Location, slope, distance from water, distance traveled and elevation were recorded every 10 min. A record of GPS fix rate was logged. No differences were detected (P≥ 0. 369) between collar types for location, slope, or distance from water. However, there was a tendency (P = 0. 08) for Knight collars to report a lower estimate for distance traveled at 6171 m d⁻¹ compared to Lotek collars at 7104 m d⁻¹. Fix rate was greater (P≤ 0. 001) for Lotek collars compared to Knight collars at 99. 9 and 66. 2 %, respectively. Study Four - Previously characterized commercial cows (n = 26) were placed into either high (positive RFI) or low intake (negative RFI) groups. On 14 May 2015, 13 high- and 13 low-intake cows were fitted with modified igotU GT- 120 ® GPS <b>logging</b> <b>collars.</b> Cattle were then placed on rangeland for 120 d. The first 30 d period animals transitioned from desert shrubland to pinyon-juniper. From 31 to 60 d, animals grazed pinyon-juniper rangeland. Next, during days 61 to 90, animals transitioned from pinyon-juniper to ponderosa pine, and the last 30 d were spent in ponderosa pine. Time periods will be referred to as month 1, 2, 3, and 4 for days 0 to 30, 31 to 60, 61 to 90, and 91 to 120, respectively. Location, slope, distance from water, elevation, and time spent close to water were recorded every 10 min. No differences were observed in the utilization of elevation or distance traveled, or distance from water (P> 0. 05). Low intake animals used a higher maximum slope (P 0. 05). Study Five - Hereford sires (n = 35) with 7 or more cow offspring on the University of Arizona V bar V ranch in Rimrock, Arizona were tested at Neogen laboratories in Lincoln, NE for an Igenity Gold genetic profile. Their residual feed intake (RFI), ADG, tenderness, marbling score, milk production percent choice, yield grade, fat thickness, ribeye area, heifer pregnancy rate, stayability, maternal calving ease, birthweight and docility were estimated. Sires were given a genetic RFI score based on their RFI profile and placed into one of three intake groups, low (0. 5 SD). Performance traits of cow offspring (n = 839) from those sires were also compared based on their sire's intake group. No differences (P > 0. 05) were detected among sire intake groups for ADG, tenderness, marbling score, percent choice, yield grade, fat thickness, ribeye area, heifer pregnancy rate, stayability, maternal calving ease, birthweight and docility. Residual feed intake differed among groups (P < 0. 05), and high intake cattle had more estimated milk production compared to low intake animals (P < 0. 05). Cows from low intake sires were born later in the year (P < 0. 05). High intake cattle had a higher (P < 0. 05) birthweight and survived longer (P < 0. 05) in the herd when compared to low and medium intake cows. Genetic RFI and expected milk production were moderately to highly correlated...|$|R
