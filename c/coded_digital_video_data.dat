With soft information from the previous decoder defined in <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> broadcasting (DVB), the proposed soft BCH decoder provides much lower complexity and latency than the traditional hard BCH decoder while still maintaining performance. The proposed error locator evaluator architecture evaluates error locations without Chien search, leading to high throughput.
