Whenever capitalized interest costs do not immediately generate proportionate tax shields, one of the assumptions that justify {{the use of the}} after-tax weighted average cost-of-capital formula is violated. As an offset to this violation, the project's free cash flows have to be adjusted. We here derive and interpret a simple adjustment formula. A numerical illustration is provided.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is about the}} prohibition of anatocism in the roman law system: it tries to explain how and when this prohibition was established and how the debtor could plead himself against the creditor’s legal action to obtain the payment <b>of</b> compound <b>interests.</b> The research has showed that the prohibition of anatocism came into force in the roman law system probably between the Ist century B. C. and the IInd century A. C. and it was completed by a gradual improvement of the debtor’s trial defence, that became effective during the IIIrd century A. C. also against the <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests,</b> especially throught the inversion {{of the burden of}} proof laid down by CI. 4. 30. 3. Subsequently it has emerged that the prohibition of anatocism concerned first of all the usurae usurarum but also the <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests,</b> although the debtor’s trial defence was improved later, in consequence of the characteristic of the models used to strike money loans (abstract stipulatio or singrapha) and the connected problem of the proof of the breach of the prohibition. The exegesis of the passages of the severian jurisprudence was useful to understand the reason (῾ratio᾽) of the prohibition: it was probably an autonomous, hard and fast prohibition but always directed to prevent the uncontrollable growth of the debt. Finally it has resulted that the Justinian’s reform of the general discipline <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> had the great merit to make clear and fix the the prohibition of anatocism...|$|R

5000|$|The federal {{government}} {{of the day was}} not prepared to deal with a bank crisis during wartime. After a leave of absence in 1917 Machaffie returned to his desk to find his position was gone. He {{wrote a letter to the}} Minister of Finance which outlined issues regarding bad loans, <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> unpaid <b>interest,</b> and accounting malpractice at head office, and stated the only hope for the bank's survival was a merger. He decided not to send the letter to the minister but instead to the Board to [...] "stir things up a bit". He was fired. On August 29, 1918, he drafted a new letter and this time sent it to the Minister of Finance outlining his concerns and a litany of delinquent and non-arms length loans and issues related to serious flaws in the Home Bank's internal auditing process.|$|R
40|$|The “values-riches ” {{model is}} a {{pedagogical}} and graphical representation of Austrian macroeconomics, combining four elements: the concept of “invariable money ” (Reisman 1996), the <b>capitalization</b> theory <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> Fetter (1904, 1914) and Mises (1998), the Hayekian structure of production (Hayek 1931), and the growth theory of Böhm-Bawerk (1959). This model offers a simple visual illustration of equilibrium, growth, and business cycle {{as they may be}} conceived in an Austrian framework. The graphical approach of this model is heavily influenced by Garrison (2001). It will be argued below that Garrison’s model represents and relates real macroeconomic magnitudes. The “values-riches ” model, 1 on the other hand, seeks to display the relations between the great macroeconomic nominal variables (“values”) and the flows of quantities of consumer goods (“riches”). The two models are therefore to some extent complementary, offering two different viewpoints on the production process. But there are also a number of theoretical disagreements between them, specially about the theory <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> that must not be overlooked and will be pointed out in this paper.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} relations between industrial enterprises and the banks in Russia {{from the perspective of}} enterprises, using data from a World Bank survey of 439 large and medium industrial Russian enterprises conducted in mid- 1994. The paper finds evidence of a large "bad debt" problem in the Russian banking sector: one quarter or more of bank debt is overdue, and it was very common for the firms in the survey to fall into arrears with their banks. The nearly universal outcome in such cases was the <b>capitalization</b> <b>of</b> overdue <b>interest</b> and the rescheduling of principal. There are, moreover, signs of adverse selection operating, with firms that do hold bank debt tending to be financially less healthy than the average across a wide range of measures. However, there are also signs of positive developments in the Russian banking sector. The ease of obtaining bank credit is positively related to the creditworthiness of the borrower, a sign that banks at least sometimes evaluate the creditworthiness of their customers when making lending decisions. The paper also finds, somewhat surprisingly, no significant evidence of insider lending: although the number of enterprises which hold shares in banks is significant (about half of the firms in the survey), most enterprises are only minority shareholders and there is no apparent impact of shareholding on credit allocation. ...|$|R
