5000|$|The CxA {{typically}} {{prepares a}} commissioning specification and <b>commissioning</b> <b>plan</b> during the project design phase. The design engineer also may develop the commissioning specification (and rarely the <b>commissioning</b> <b>plan)</b> {{in situations where}} the CxA has not been so contracted, or brought into the design team during the design process. The <b>commissioning</b> <b>plan</b> is a live document that outlines the commissioning processes and expectation based on the Owner's OPR, the design engineer's basis of design (BOD) and the project construction document (drawings and specifications). The <b>commissioning</b> <b>plan</b> is modified as the commissioning process progresses throughout the design, construction, and final acceptance of the facility. The functional performance test procedures are typically developed by the CxA with assistance of the trade contractors, vendors, and manufacturers based on the design engineer's contract documents. These same parties and the design engineer, and owner's representative (typically the facility operating engineer) review the functional performance test procedures and expected outcomes prior to testing. The systems, equipment, items, processes, modes, and sequences of operations to be tested by the CxA (contractors or others) should be detailed and identified in the design engineer's construction documents (drawings and specifications), the construction request for proposal (RFP), the contractors bid submission, the commissioning specifications, the <b>commissioning</b> <b>plan,</b> and the contractors submittals. Of utmost importance, often neglected by contractors, are the equipment/systems [...] "installation and operations manuals" [...] (IOM or IO&M) [...] "specific to the project" [...] (not generic). The IOM's along with complete, and very detailed, sequence of operations (SOO) and control drawings/documents submittal [...] "specific to the project" [...] (not generic) are of utmost importance to the CxA to perform the review and develop proper testing procedures. Timely delivery of these documents to the CxA is important to facilitate the CxA ample time to review, develop test, obtain reviews, and implement changes prior to scheduling of any testing.|$|E

This SOO is also reviewed by the CxA who utilizes the SOO to develop the functional performance test procedures.

40|$|Abstract. Since all of {{the sixteen}} {{toroidal}} field (TF) magnets were completely assembled in February 2006, the assembly of the KSTAR is being actively progressed to meet the assembly finish {{by the middle of}} 2007. According to the assembly plan, all the SC magnets and most of the in-cryostat components such as the buslines, helium piping system, thermal shields, and various sensor cables will be installed in the cryostat within 2006. Moreover, we are preparing the integrated <b>commissioning</b> <b>plan</b> in parallel with rigorous assembly works. In this paper we present an overview of the KSTAR assembly progress report up to October 2006, and the remaining works including general <b>commissioning</b> <b>plan.</b> 1...|$|E
