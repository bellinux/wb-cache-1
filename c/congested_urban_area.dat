40|$|This work {{develops}} a systemic approach for enabling transshipment operations in <b>congested</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas,</b> {{based on two}} fundamental city logistics needs: efficient utilization of existing infrastructure and flexibility for logistics operators. Specifically, this research introduces the concept of urban transshipment networks (UTNs), a collection of strategically located urban logistics spaces, for efficient and flexible last-mile delivery operations in <b>congested</b> <b>urban</b> <b>areas.</b> By implementing the UTN framework, logistics operators can select the transshipment locations, vehicle types and operating schedules that best fit specific distribution strategies, and, simultaneously, comply with access restrictions and overcome some of the logistics complexity of dense urban zones. This concept is particularly relevant for retail dynamics observed in large metropolitan areas in the emerging world. A two-echelon location-routing model formulation is proposed to address the UTN design problem. The formulation combines a mixed-integer programing model with a closed-form routing cost approximation. The model was tested through a consumer goods distribution case study in Latin America. Results suggest that, given proper fleet type and capacity, UTNs can significantly improve delivery process efficiency in highly congested districts. by Daniel Esteban Merchán Dueñas. Thesis: S.

The rational performance-based approach verification are ultimate limit state and serviceability limit state.

In excavation design, the serviceability limit state is the governing criterion, particularly for the cases of the <b>congested</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area.</b> However, no procedures are currently available for assessing serviceability reliability of braced excavation system.

The improved geotechnical practice in excavation can aid in protecting public from loss of life and property damage.

40|$|Although walking {{has been}} {{considered}} as an important transport mode, pedestrian modelling has received little attention in either academic or practising circles. There is an increasing need for methods {{that can be used}} to help the planning, design and management of pedestrian traffic systems. This paper presents a nonlinear programming formulation of the dynamic pedestrian equilibrium assignment problem based on the following assumptions. The pedestrian traffic system in a <b>congested</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> can be modelled as a capacitated network with alternative walkway sections. People in this pedestrian network make such decisions as selecting departure time and walking path between origins and destinations (OD). The study horizon is divided equally into shorter time intervals of 5 - 10 minutes each, for which the pedestrian departure time matrices are given by a logit formula. It is dependent on the predetermined departure time costs and the equilibrium OD walking costs. In the proposed model, a 'quasi-continuous' technique is adopted to smooth out the transitions of various variables between time intervals and to satisfy the first-in-first-out discipline. A heuristic algorithm that generates approximate solutions to the model is presented. The numerical results in a real network shows that the model and algorithm proposed in this paper are able to capture the main characteristics of the departure time and route choices in congested unidirectional pedestrian traffic systems.

This potential problem is amplified {{in the case of}} deep excavation in the <b>congested</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> where high rises are adjacent to each other. The response of a braced system in deep excavation involves complex soil-structure interaction that is difficult to evaluate analytically. The design of an excavation have to consider stability of braced system to avoid collapse and control ground movements to maintain the integrity of structures adjacent to an excavation. The traditional design method without regard to the degree of uncertainty involved in its analysis. As a result, engineers often face the problem of over-design or under-design and the associated disputes and lawsuits. Reliability assessment of the limit state performance of a braced excavation systems may offer a more rational way to prevent or reduce the chance of failure, including damage to the adjacent buildings. However, no procedures are currently available for assessing ultimate or serviceability reliability of braced excavation system. In the proposed research, the reliability analysis methods, are used along with stability analysis methods and deformation analysis methods to establish a framework for a rigorous fully-probabilistic assessment of excavation.

However, when detailed disaggregated truck activity data is available, the analysis of commercial vehicle routes and trip chain structures can provide insightful information about urban commercial vehicle tours, travel patterns, and congestion levels. Where truck data is usually aggregated and cross-sectional, this research analyzes several months of detailed truck activity records in a <b>congested</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> and thus contributes a level of investigation unavailable with aggregated data. To {{the best of the}} author 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge, there is no published research regarding the analysis of disaggregated truck data in congested areas.

This paper identifies route patterns and analyzes their relationship to trip and tour length distribution. Travel between different industrial suburbs explains the shape of multimodal trip length distributions. Variations in daily demand explain the normal-like shape of the tour trip distribution. Tour data indicates that there is no clear relationship between tour distance, percentage of empty trips, and percentage of empty distance. Congestion data indicates that the standard deviation of travel speed is significant. In addition, correlations between travel times are positive and they should be used as an additional congestion measure for trip-chains or urban freight tours.

Several problems will be encountered based on the use of oblique imagery. The major one is the occlusion comes from the building itself and the other buildings. This is serious especially for a <b>congested</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> or a city with high-rise buildings. The proposed algorithm includes two major steps. The fist step is to generate all façade’s texture within one image. However, the façade texture will be generated only when a certain geometric quality has achieved. The imaging geometry was estimated based on the incident angle between the camera-to-facade vector and the façade’s normal direction. The second step is to detect and remove the occluded area based on existing 3 D building models. Those two steps will be performed for all oblique images. However, in case one façade texture has been generated before and any marked occluded area has found, then a seamless Mosaicking procedure will be applied to achieve a complete texture. Meanwhile, due to errors always exist in exterior/interior orientation parameters and building models, some defect will occur along the boundary of occluded area. Thus, an amendment is necessary to remove this defect. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective and useful for automatic façade texture mapping...|$|E

Samples from the environment around Colombo, which is a highly <b>congested</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> with much industrial development, were found to be more polluted when compared with Kurunegala, a city that is less congested and without industries.

From the elements reported from the 2 cities, K, Ca, Ti, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Pb were reported at concentrations higher than background levels. Levels of Pb and Zn in samples from Colombo were higher than those from Kurunegala, refl ecting the increased vehicular traffi c.
