In addition, the proposed 4 T 2 R nv-SRAM features much smaller parasitic <b>capacitance</b> <b>comparing</b> <b>to</b> other previously reported nv-SRAMs [29 – 31] which require back-end-of-line (BEOL) non-volatile components.

50|$|Since it is {{shorter than}} λ/4 the T antenna {{has a high}} {{capacitive}} reactance. In transmitting antennas, to make the antenna resonant {{so it can be}} driven efficiently, this capacitance must be canceled out by adding an inductor, a loading coil, in series with the bottom of the antenna. Particularly at lower frequencies, the high inductance and <b>capacitance</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> its low radiation resistance makes the loaded antenna behave like a high Q tuned circuit, with a narrow bandwidth over which it will remain impedance matched to the transmission line, compared to a λ/4 monopole. To operate over a large frequency range the loading coil often must be adjustable, and adjusted when the frequency is changed to keep the SWR low. The high Q also causes a high voltage on the antenna, roughly Q times the driving-point voltage. The insulators at the ends must be designed to withstand these voltages. In high power transmitters the output power is often limited by the onset of corona discharge on the wires.|$|E
50|$|The typical 500 volts {{between the}} {{backside}} of the last MCP and the anode cannot be fed into the preamplifier. Therefore, the inner or the outer conductor needs a DC-block, that is, a capacitor. Often it is chosen to only have 10-fold <b>capacitance</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> the MCP-anode capacitance and is implemented as a plate capacitor. Rounded, electro-polished metal plates and the ultra high vacuum allow very high field strengths and high capacitance without a dielectric. The bias for the center conductor is applied via resistors hanging through the waveguide (see bias tee). If the DC block {{is used in the}} outer conductor, it is in parallel with the larger capacitor in the power supply. Assuming good screening, the only noise is due to current noise from the linear power regulator. Because the current is low in this application and space for large capacitors is available, and because the DC-block capacitor is fast, it is possible to have very low voltage noise, so that even weak MCP signals can be detected. Sometimes the preamplifier is on a potential (off ground) and gets its power through a low-power isolation transformer and outputs its signal optically.|$|E

30|$|Electrochemical Capacitors {{also called}} supercapacitors or ultracapacitors are the energy storage devices, {{intermediate}} between {{high energy density}} batteries and high power density capacitors. Carbon, metal oxides and conducting polymers are the active electrode materials used in supercapacitors. Conducting polymers and metal oxides offer high <b>capacitances</b> <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> carbon materials due to faradaic reactions (pseudocapacitors) occurring in {{the bulk of the}} material, but suffer from low power density <b>compared</b> <b>to</b> carbon, which stores energy only on the surface (electric double layer capacitor, EDLC). Among the pseudocapacitive materials (metal oxides and conducting polymers), generally, metal oxides are expensive and toxic, whereas the utilization and application of conducting polymers are limited by the relative poor cycling stability owing to the damage of the polymer backbone during the fast redox processes. To develop a supercapacitor with better performance, a combination of carbon-based materials (EDLC) is widely being tried out along with conducting polymers (pseudocapacitive).This hybrid composite materials are expected to give a high-performance characteristics due to the synergistic effects [1, 2]. Thus, polyaniline–graphene oxide composite material is anticipated to possess the distinctive properties of both the graphene oxide and the polyaniline, such as good mechanical strength because of the carbon matrix, excellent electrical conductivity due to polyaniline and graphene oxide, and pseudocapacitance due to polyaniline, thus holding a great promise for hybrid supercapacitors.|$|R
