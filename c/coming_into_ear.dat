25|$|The aristae of the barley, {{which was}} <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>ear,</b> became brown and {{withered}} at their extremities, {{as did the}} leaves of the oats; the rye had the appearance of being mildewed; so that the farmers were alarmed for those crops. The wheat was not much affected. The larch, Weymouth pine, and hardy Scotch fir, had the tips of their leaves withered.|$|E
60|$|Just before I {{had left}} Mamajam {{the people had}} sown a {{considerable}} quantity of maize, which appears above ground {{in two or three}} days, and in favourable seasons ripens in less than two months. Owing to a week's premature rains the ground was all flooded when I returned, and the plants just <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>ear</b> were yellow and dead. Not a grain would be obtained by the whole village, but luckily it is only a luxury, not a necessity of life. The rain was the signal for ploughing to begin, in order to sow rice on all the flat lands between us and the town. The plough used is a rude wooden instrument with a very short single handle, a tolerably well-shaped coulter, and the point formed of a piece of hard palm-wood fastened in with wedges. One or two buffaloes draw it at a very slow pace. The seed is sown broadcast, and a rude wooden harrow is used to smooth the surface.|$|E

50|$|As {{the above}} {{quotation}} shows, Müller's law seems to {{differ from the}} modern statement {{of the law in}} one key way. Müller attributed the quality of an experience to some specific quality of the energy in the nerves. For example, the visual experience from light shining into the eye, or from a poke in the eye, arises from some special quality of the energy carried by optic nerve, and the auditory experience from sound <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> the <b>ear,</b> or from electrical stimulation of the cochlea, arises from some different, special quality of the energy carried by the auditory nerve. In 1912, Lord Edgar Douglas Adrian showed that all neurons carry the same energy, electrical energy in the form of action potentials. That means that the quality of an experience depends {{on the part of the}} brain to which nerves deliver their action potentials (e.g., light from nerves arriving at the visual cortex and sound from nerves arriving at the auditory cortex).|$|R
5000|$|A two-pin version, {{known to}} the telecom {{industry}} as a [...] "310 connector" [...] consists of two phone 1⁄4 inch phone plugs at a centre spacing of 0.625 inches. The socket versions of these {{can be used with}} normal phone plugs provided the plug bodies are not too large, but the plug version will only mate with two sockets at 0.625 inches centre spacing, or with line sockets, again with sufficiently small bodies. These connectors are still widely used today in telephone company central offices on [...] "DSX" [...] patch panels for DS1 circuits. A similar type of 3.5 mm connector is often used in the armrests of older aircraft, as part of the on-board in-flight entertainment system. Plugging a stereo plug into one of the two mono jacks typically results in the audio <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> only one <b>ear.</b> Adapters are available.|$|R

40|$|Wheat cv. 'Grana' grown under field {{conditions}} was sprayed with solutions of Ethrel (500, 1000 and 3000 ppm) in three phases of plant development: tillering, appearance of the first node of a culm and <b>coming</b> <b>into</b> <b>ear.</b> The plant analysis was done seven days after the last spray. It {{has been found that}} Ethrel treatment decreased the length of a straw, reduced plant susceptibility to Cercosporella herpotrichoides nfection and that with species of the Fusarium genus. On the other hand it increased wheat susceptibility to Erysiphe graminis infection, and particularly to that with Puccinia triticina. Ethrel slightly affected the mycoflora of the root zone - it significantly increased only the percentage of species of the genus Penicillium and reduced that of Mucor hiemalis. The Ethrel effect on the specific composition of rhizoplane mycoflora proved to be insignificant...|$|E
