5|$|In December, the {{regiment}} saw its first combat of their second enlistment during the Goldsboro Expedition. The {{objective of this}} maneuver was to disrupt the Confederate supply line along the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad by destroying the Goldsboro Bridge. Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> expedition, the unit marched 180 miles and {{took part in the}} Battles of Kinston, White Hall and Goldsboro Bridge. During the latter engagement on December 15, 1864, the Goldsboro Bridge was destroyed by Union troops. On December 17, the expedition began its return march to New Bern while the 5th Massachusetts was posted to act as rear guard. In meeting these orders, they withstood heavy fire for two hours and repulsed one infantry charge. At the close of the expedition, {{the regiment}} had suffered light casualties of eight wounded.|$|E
5|$|On 27 June, the division's {{defensive}} {{positions at}} Minqar Qaim were encircled by the 21st Panzer Division.

In the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> movement, Gray's column ran into an encampment of tanks of the 21st Panzer Division. However, the Germans failed to capitalise on the opportunity and the train of vehicles, with Gray at its head to ensure it did not come to a stop, was able to skirt the panzers with relatively few losses and reach the Alamein lines.|$|E

5|$|The Brothers {{worked for}} Philadelphia-based Pro Wrestling Unplugged (PWU) {{since at least}} September 17, 2005, when they {{defeated}} The S.A.T. and All Money is Legal to win the then-vacant PWU Tag Team Championship. They held that title until April 22, 2006, when they dropped it to the S.A.T. After further appearances in 2006, which were all matches they lost, the Briscoe Brothers entered PWU's Pitbull/Public Enemy Memorial Cup on October 20. They advanced past the first round match, winning over the Krash Krew, but in the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> match, Mark was injured when Jay inadvertently struck him in the mouth with the backswing of a chairshot.

5|$|The Venetians had a {{possible}} and willing {{ally in the}} person of Junayd, ruler of the Aydinid principality in central western Anatolia. Junayd was a capable and energetic ruler who tried to form a broader anti-Ottoman alliance including the Karamanids of central Anatolia, and to renew the Ottoman civil war by sending another Ottoman prince, Ismail, to Rumelia. In the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> conflict, Murad allied himself with Venice's rival, the Republic of Genoa, to blockade the coasts of Junayd's domain and prevent Ismail from setting sail. Junayd was finally subdued in spring 1425, depriving Venice of any assistance. In February 1424, Murad also concluded a peace with the Byzantines, who returned almost all the lands they had gained in 1403 and, reduced to Constantinople and its environs, became tributary vassals to the Ottomans once more.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September, the {{commander}} of the 104th Brigade, Colonel Ivan Rukljić, took command of all Croatian forces in Varaždin. The Yugoslav Air Force attacked an airfield in Čakovec, mimicking the strike carried out in Varaždin a few days earlier. That evening, the heaviest fighting of the siege erupted in Varaždin, and the 104th Brigade reported it was uncertain how long it would be able to maintain the blockades. Croatian forces received additional weapons that day, after the JNA garrisons in Čakovec, Križevci and Virovitica surrendered to the ZNG. In Varaždin itself, corps-level units of the JNA 32nd Corps based at the 15. maj barracks also surrendered to the ZNG that day. The following day, fighting intensified again, as Croatian forces captured several minor JNA facilities in Varaždin itself—leaving the Corps headquarters, the Kalnički partizani barracks and the Jalkovečke žrtve barracks as the only JNA-held military bases in the city. In the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> fighting, the ZNG suffered one fatality and captured nine JNA officers and 30 soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> tour, My Chemical Romance dubbed {{themselves}} The Black Parade for {{the first}} part of their performance, convincing many concert goers that The Black Parade was initially a separate, opening band. During the tour there were several cancellations and some members left the tour for personal or medical reasons. Leading up to their tour date at The DCU Arena, many of the staff members of the tour fell ill with food poisoning. The band Circa Survive had to replace Muse, members of which also suffered from the same food poisoning. On January 11, 2007 Frank Iero left the tour because of an unspecified illness. He was replaced by Drive By guitarist Todd Price. Mikey Way took time off to get married and spend time with his new wife (Alicia Simmons) and was replaced by guitar tech, Matt Cortez, from April 18, 2007 until October 4, 2007. Six shows were cancelled from April 29, 2007 to May 4, 2007 after the band and crew contracted food poisoning. Bob Bryar suffered injuries relating to his wrists during the tour which led to the cancellation of the show at the University of Maine on October 27, 2007. Bryar left the tour on November 9, 2007 and was replaced by a friend of the band, Wagner, who wished to remain anonymous. Following the November 11, 2007 show in Newcastle, Frank Iero left the tour to return home after learning about a family member's illness. He was replaced by Matt Cortez.|$|E
5|$|The Altes Stadthaus is {{arranged}} around two rectangular internal courtyards. The main section, which faces Mühlheimer Platz, has a mansard roof and is framed by four-storey turrets. The main entrance {{is at the}} southwest corner of Bottlerplatz, and the building bridges Windeckstraße, with two low arched openings. Bestelmayer's building was intended to be the nucleus of future development in the centre of Bonn. However, the only other construction there was the tax office on the corner of Mülheimer Platz and Münsterstraße, built in 1937, and some further building on Bottlerplatz. After the Neues Stadthaus—the new city administration building—was built, the main floor of the section of Altes Stadthaus facing Mühlheimer Platz was rebuilt to house the library. In the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> restructuring, the two courtyards were roofed over and several interior walls replaced with columns. The east wing of the building was demolished {{to make way for a}} C department store.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) {{attack on}} Nazareth was made {{possible}} by the British Empire infantry attack on 19 September which began the Battle of Sharon. The EEF infantry attacked along an almost continuous front from the Mediterranean Sea, across the Plain of Sharon and into the Judean Hills. The XXI Corps's British Indian Army infantry captured Tulkarm and the headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army. During the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> attack, the infantry created a gap in the Ottoman front line defences through which the Desert Mounted Corps rode northwards to begin the cavalry phase of the battle. Subsequently, the infantry also captured Tabsor, Et Tire and Arara to outflank the Eighth Army. Meanwhile, the Desert Mounted Corps advanced to capture the communications hubs of Afulah, Beisan and Jenin on 20 September, cutting the main Ottoman withdrawal routes along their lines of supply and communications.|$|E
40|$|A 69 -year-old female visited our {{department}} with {{a diagnosis of}} rectosigmoid cancer and multiple hepatic metastases (stage IV). Abdominal CT revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the bilateral lobes of the liver. The primary lesion {{was considered to be}} resectable, and high anterior resection of the rectum was performed. After the operation, 6 <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> therapy with bevacizumab (BV) and modified FOLFOX 6 were performed. CT showed a partial response, and tumor marker levels became normal. After a total <b>of</b> 11 <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> therapy, grade 3 peripheral neuropathy developed, and the therapy was changed to BV and capecitabine (Cape). After 6 <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> therapy, CT showed the maintenance of partial response, and tumor marker levels were also within the normal range. BV and Cape therapy may be useful not only for reducing peripheral neuropathy, but also as a maintenance therapy in patients requiring the suspension of oxaliplatin administration due to peripheral neuropathy...|$|R
