40|$|From way back, the Netherlands is {{a trading}} nation. International trade and {{transport}} are important sources of income. However, the international transport flows {{also lead to}} costs for society. Therefore, careful assessments are needed when investing in infrastructure, transport and logistics. To make such assessments, the availability of quantitative information on international trade and transport flows is essential. The information on international <b>commodity</b> <b>flows</b> is distributed among several statistical products by Statistics Netherlands (CBS) : the statistics of international trade in goods and the six transport statistics. Even together these statistics cannot complete the picture of international <b>commodity</b> <b>flows</b> of the Netherlands. Transit is not visible in the statistics. Furthermore, a complete view of the value and weight of <b>commodity</b> <b>flows</b> broken down by content, origin, destination and transport mode is lacking. Now, a new statistics integrates the statistics {{of international trade and}} transport by using a Bayesian integration model. The model takes care that the trade and transport figures are mutually consistent and satisfy logical restrictions. This results in a better view of the international <b>commodity</b> <b>flows</b> to, from and through the Netherlands broken down by commodity type and continent of origin or destination.

40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} a methodology to estimate current commodity inflows to a sub-state region using a supply-side, commodity-by-industry input-output model and <b>commodity</b> <b>flow</b> data for American states. Since the 1993 <b>Commodity</b> <b>Flow</b> Survey {{does not go}} below the state level, the estimation of commodity flows to a particular sub-state region in the United States has always proven difficult. By combining state-level <b>commodity</b> <b>flow</b> data with the supply-side commodity-by-industry input-output model, an estimate of commodity flows to smaller regions {{can be carried out}} entirely based on the regional industrial structure. Since the actual sub-state flows are typically unobserved, the accuracy of the methodology is unknown. However, by applying the same methodology to larger regions, with actual states used as the forecast region, the estimates can be compared to actual flows. We carry out this test of the methodologys accuracy, and report the results...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} is the {{construction}} of estimates of interregional <b>commodity</b> <b>flows</b> for the regions of the Czech Republic, by using a gravity model. Gravity model is based on Newton's law of gravitation. Gravity models {{can be used in}} two different information contexts. The first is an information context, when the spatial interaction flows are known a priori, and the model is used to explain the trade flows' behaviour. And the second is an information context in which these interactions are totally unknown a priori and the flows must be estimated. This paper is focused on the second information context. When we estimating <b>commodity</b> <b>flows</b> we need to know the value of exports and imports for individual regions. Estimated interregional <b>commodity</b> <b>flows</b> are the results of this work. Estimated interregional flows are put into the regional input-output tables compiled by the Department of Economic Statistics. Regional input-output tables are arranged so as to reached the equality of resources and use. On the basis of the resulting tables for all regions, I conducted a input-output analysis. Input-output analysis examines the impact of model changes to investment on selected commodities, to estimated interregional flows and selected macroeconomic indicators...|$|R

40|$|In {{classical}} {{linear network}} flow (LNF) problems, a network consists of multiple source and sink nodes, where each node is a sink node or a source node, but not both. Usually, {{there is only}} one kind of <b>commodity</b> <b>flow</b> and the goal is to find flow schedules and routes such that all sink nodes’ flow demands are satisfied and the total flow transmission cost is minimized. We develop a capacity expansion multicommodity network flow (CEMNF) problem, in which the total commodity supply is less than the total commodity demand. There are more than one kind of commodities and each node is a <b>commodity</b> <b>flow</b> generator, as well as a consumer. It is allowed to do expansion for <b>commodity</b> <b>flow</b> generation capacities at each node and also to do expansion for <b>commodity</b> <b>flow</b> capacities of each arc so that more flow can be transmitted among nodes. Thus, CEMNF is not only a <b>commodity</b> <b>flow</b> routing problem, but also a commodity generation and flow planning problem, in which the increasing commodity demands need to be satisfied by generation/transmission capacity expansions. The goal of CEMNF problems is to find the flow routes and capacity expansion plans such that all flow demands are satisfied and the total cost of routing and planning is minimized. High-performance distributed computing algorithms have been designed to solve classical linear network flow (LNF) problems have been proposed. Solving the general CEMNF problems by high-performance distributed computing algorithms is an open research question. The LNF problems can be formulated as linear programming models and algorithms have been proposed to solve them efficiently on distributed computing platforms. But, the constraints of the CEMNF problems do not allow them to solve using the same methodology. In this paper, we also develop a transformation method to transform CEMNF problems into LNF problems in polynomial time and space complexity to solve them efficiently on distributed computing platforms. The results show that we can solve CEMNF problems with high performance...|$|E
