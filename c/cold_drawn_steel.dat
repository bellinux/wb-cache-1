A piston valve incorporating transfer ports was fitted between each high-pressure and low-pressure cylinder in an arrangement similar to Vauclain's balanced compound system used on a number of railway locomotives around 1900. Stephenson's valve gear replaced the previous Joy motion. This engine was used on all vehicles developed thereafter. Again, the car neither possessed nor needed a clutch or transmission, and due to the engine being integrated directly into the rear axle, it did not need a drive shaft either. Like all steam vehicles it could burn a variety of liquid fuels with a minimum of modification and was a noticeably clean running vehicle, its fuel being burned at high temperatures and low pressures, which produced very low pollution. Price ranged from $8,800 to $11,200 in 1923. The Model E ran on a 142 in wheelbase. Twenty-four E's were made between 1922 and 1925 with a variety of body types from roadsters to limousines. Owners included Howard Hughes and the Maharajah of Bharatpur. One of the Hughes cars, a roadster engine number 20, is currently owned by Jay Leno. Abner Doble owned the last one - number 24.|$|E

For each configuration, the experimental results permit to identify the friction coefficients and the different sliding regimes (partial slip regime, mixed regime and gross slip regime).

The friction coefficients in gross slip regime and at the transition are strongly reduced in water compared to air. Damage mechanisms, in particular cracking, are observed for both environments. They depend on the number of fretting cycles and on the relative displacements between the wires. The immersion in water seems to reduce the cracking damage, for higher strokes...|$|R

40|$|Cold drawn {{eutectoid}} steel wires {{have been widely}} used for a variety of applications, such as suspension bridges, steel cords for automobile tires, and springs. Much research has been done to increase their mechanical strength. With advances in modern production technology, both the drawing speed and the quality of drawn steels have been enhanced. After a careful literature survey, it is obvious that some issues are still controversial. As Y. S. Yang, J. G. Bae and C. G. Park mentioned, the lamellar spacing, thickness and volume fraction of cementites have all reached the nanometer regime, and the conventional theory is not enough to explain it. Besides, the cementite dissolution is a huge problem to the performance, according to Y. S. Yang and C. G. Park. To address the above issues, a systematic study has been taken on the wire drawing process under the conditions of the industrial production. Through the morphology, microscopic, mechanical and comprehensive analysis, a clear understanding of the microstructures and associated professing conditions of the high-strength carbon steel wires has been obtained.

40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>steel</b> wires {{lead to an}} {{increase}} of their mechanical strength and to a drop of their ductility. The increase of their mechanical strength has long been related to the reduction of the various material scales by plastic deformation, but the mechanisms controlling their elongation to failure have received relatively little attention. It is usually found that heavily deformed materials show a tendency to plastic strain localization and necking. However, in this paper it is shown that, though the steel wires are plastically deformed up to strain levels as high as 3. 5, a significant capability of plastic deformation is preserved in as-drawn wires. This apparent contradiction is resolved by the existence of residual stresses inside the wire. Finite element analyses have been conducted in order to show that residual stresses, inherited from the drawing process, are sufficient to produce a significant hardening effect during a post-drawing tensile test, without introducing any hardening in the local material behaviour. The main conclusion of this paper is that once thematerial has lost its hardening capabilities, residual stresses, inherited from the process, control the elongation of <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> wires. The finite element method allowed also the determination of the residual stress field that would lead to the best agreement between the simulated and the experimental stress strain curve of as-drawn wires...|$|R
40|$|The fatigue {{behavior}} of heavily drawn steel wires with a diameter ranging from 0. 175 to 0. 3 mm {{and a total}} strain of about 3. 5 has been studied. It is observed that the fatigue data of heavily drawn steel wires shows a very large scatter compared to normal fatigue data. A fractographical study revealed different fatigue crack initiation mechanisms, resulting into different fatigue lives. Two different crack growth mechanisms were observed, namely short and long crack growth. A new approach is developed and used to estimate the threshold stress intensity factor range for crack growth {{which is based on}} fatigue crack initiations at internal non-metallic inclusions. At these internal crack initiations a characteristic area is formed around the inclusion (in literature this region is called optical dark area, granularly bright facet or facet). This area corresponds to the short crack growth regime. The transition between short and long crack growth, which can be seen clearly by fractography, is used to estimate threshold stress intensity factor range for crack growth. The threshold stress intensity factor range for crack growth is estimated for different stress amplitudes and load ratios (R). It is observed that it is independent of the stress amplitude and that the fatigue crack growth is Kmax controlled for R 0. 16. The two asymptotes of the (Delta K, Kmax) graph are calculated to be 3. 82 ± 0. 09 and 4. 47 ± 0. 16 MPa√m respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Progressive <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> in {{eutectoid}} <b>steels</b> {{produces a}} preferential {{orientation of the}} pearlitic micorstructure in the wire axis or drawing direction.

Therefore, an initial transverse crack changes its propagation direction to approach that of the wire axis, thus producing mixed mode propagation, the deflection angle being an increasing function of the <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> degree.

In addition, the fatigue crack growth rate in the Paris regime, da/dN, obeys mainly to the parameter ΔK and it is hardly ever affected by Kmax. The study of the fatigue fracture surface shows: (i) that the micro-roughness of ductile micro-tearing patterns is a function of Kmax; (ii) the existence, in some tests, of a small zone with fatigue initiation fractography (with a tearing topography surface), related to the decrease of crack tip opening displacement, a phenomenon similar to that of crack initiation and growth from a micro-notch...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>drawing</b> of <b>steel</b> wires {{leads to}} an {{increase}} of their mechanical strength and to a drop in their ductility. The increase of their mechanical strength has long been related to {{the reduction of the}} various material scales by an intense plastic deformation. Besides, it was discussed in the companion paper that large plastic deformation leads to the loss of the material hardening capabilities and that, in such a case, residual stresses preserve the elongation to failure of wires. Experimental measurements of residual stresses inside the wire have therefore been undertaken. In this paper, lattice parameters as measured using synchrotron diffraction are compared with those calculated using the residual stress fields as determined by the finite-element method. There is a major disagreement between experimental and numerical results that is too large to be attributed to the errors of the finite-element analyses. Therefore, neutron diffraction experiments have also been performed. These measurements show that there is a significant variation of the lattice parameter with the drawing level, which is not inherited from residual stresses, and that variation is very sensitive to the cooling rate after processing. It is therefore proposed that <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> would induce a phase transformation of the steel, possibly a martensitic transformation...|$|R

The aim of {{this paper}} is to present recent {{microstructural}} investigations concerning two kinds of materials produced by industrial processes through high level of plastic deformations. To help in further understanding in the strengthening mechanism of such nanocomposite wires, the evolution of the microstructure was investigated using field ion microscopy (FIM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Three Dimensional Atom Probe (3 D-AP). Niobium fibres and copper channels a few nanometers width with smooth interfaces were exhibited in the Cu/Nb wire. A deep interdiffusion of Cu and Nb was pointed out. This mechanical alloying induced by drawing is attributed to the strong increase of the interfacial energy of the system. Shear bands were also observed perpendicular to the wire axis.

It is shown that these steels exhibit a sharp transition in fracture behavior between a drawing strain of 320 % and 520 % with a drop in fracture toughness from 7. 5 to 4 MPam(1 / 2). This is confirmed from the nature of fracture which is stable with some degree of plasticity at drawing strains below 320 % and changes to catastrophic cleavage fracture at drawing strains of 420 % and above. This transition and associated brittleness is attributed to structural (cementite decomposition and strain induced increase in tetragonality) and microstructural (increasing nanocrystallinity and dislocation density) evolution that these steels undergo at higher drawing strains. On heat treating, the 420 % strained sample, brittle cleavage fracture continues for low temperature (200 degrees C) annealing with no visible changes in microstructure, while crack growth is suppressed and large-scale plasticity is recovered for high temperature (500 degrees C) annealing with accompanying grain coarsening, and re-precipitation of spherodized cementite at grain boundaries...|$|R

Accordingly, flow boiling heat transfer characteristics may vary. In addition, there is no common agreement between researchers on the criteria of selecting tubes for flow boiling experiments. Instead, tubes are usually ordered from commercial suppliers, in many cases without taking into consideration the manufacturing method and its effect on the heat transfer process. This may explain some of the discrepancies in heat transfer characteristics which are found in the open literature. This paper presents a comparison between experimental flow boiling heat transfer results obtained using two different metallic tubes. The first one is a seamless <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> stainless <b>steel</b> tube of 1. 1 mm inner diameter while the second is a welded stainless steel tube of 1. 16 mm inner diameter. Both tubes have a heated length of 150 mm and the flow direction is vertically upwards. The tubes were heated using DC current. Other experimental conditions include: 8 bar system pressure, 300 kg/m 2 s mass flux, about 5 K inlet sub-cooling and up to 0. 9 exit quality. The results are presented in the form of local heat transfer coefficient versus local quality and axial distance. Also, the boiling curves of the two tubes are discussed. The results show a significant effect of tube inner surface morphology on the heat transfer characteristics...|$|R
