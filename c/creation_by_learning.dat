40|$|Internet {{telephony}} {{can introduce}} many novel communication services, however, novelty puts learning burden on users. It {{will be a}} great help to users if their desired services can be created automatically. We developed an intelligent communication service creation environment which can handle automatic service <b>creation</b> <b>by</b> <b>learning</b> from users' daily communication behaviors. The service creation environment models communication services as decision trees and uses the Incremental Tree Induction (ITI) algorithm for decision tree learning. We use Language for End System Services (LESS) scripts to represent learned results and implemented a simulation environment to verify the learning algorithm. We also noticed that when users get their desired services, they may not be aware of unexpected behaviors that the serivces could introduce, for example, mistakenly rejecting expected calls. In this paper, we also did a comprehensive analysis on communication service fail-safe handling and propose several approaches to create fail-safe services...|$|E
40|$|Blended {{e-learning}} is {{the integration}} of different learning theories with e-learning, e-collaboration and e-communication in views of appropriateness and cost-effectiveness. The Internet and the World Wide Web have changed how we obtain and share information in blended e-learning and knowledge management. Under the rapid advancement of the information communications technologies (ICT), e-Schools without physical boundaries are emerging in which students, teachers, parents, professionals, web-citizens and communities are linked together by the e-communicating environment in the e-collaborative learning environment towards learning success. This paper explains the goals, benefits and instructional strategies of blended e-learning; the promotion of self-directed learning skills and knowledge <b>creation</b> <b>by</b> its e-collaborative <b>learning</b> environment; and the design, implementation and evaluation of geomatics curriculum under the blended e-learning model. 1...|$|R
40|$|Theories of {{knowledge-based}} competition {{focus on}} internal resources {{as the source}} of value creation. The HR architecture (Lepak 2 ̆ 6 Snell, 1999) brought human resource management directly into this forum by developing a model of human capital allocation and management. We attempt to extend the HR architecture by introducing a framework of relational archetypes—entrepreneurial and cooperative—that are derived from unique combinations of three dimensions (cognitive, structural, and affective) that characterize internal and external relationships of core knowledge employees. Entrepreneurial archetypes facilitate value creation from external partnerships while cooperative archetypes facilitate value creation from internal partnerships. This paper identifies how each of these archetypes is managed by a corresponding HR configuration and how they together contribute to value <b>creation</b> <b>by</b> facilitating organizational <b>learning</b> via exploration and exploitation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn a {{continuously}} changing external environment, {{the learning}} organization {{can provide a}} competitive advantage. However, the concept has been largely criticized {{for the lack of}} guidelines and tools on how it could be developed. This undermines the opportunity {{for the development of the}} learning organization. This paper aims to contribute toward the debate on its <b>creation</b> <b>by</b> proposing a <b>Learning</b> Organization Atlas Framework approach. This framework comprises of the facets of the learning organization that characterize them, a Learning Organization Grid for the analysis and benchmarking of organizations, a Learning Organization Atlas that can be used for developing models of them, and a Learning Organization Road Map that includes the intentions of the organization and the strategies to achieve those intentions. With the framework and its four elements, we propose a method for modeling the learning organization and organizational change by providing embedded flexibility. The next level for research is in identifying the influence between different facets, strategy selection, and development of guidelines for models of learning organizations...|$|R
