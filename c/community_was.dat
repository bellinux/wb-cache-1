5|$|In {{terms of}} renewal, Eliot {{believed}} that suffering {{was needed for}} all of society before new life could begin. The original Little Gidding <b>community</b> <b>was</b> built for living on monastic lines, but the <b>community</b> <b>was</b> damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646. The church, {{the centre of the}} <b>community,</b> <b>was</b> restored in 1714 and again in 1853. The image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the London air-raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world. This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit, Pentecost, communion with the dead, and the repetition of history. The theme is also internal to Eliot's own poems; the image of the rose garden at the end Little Gidding is the image that begins Burnt Norton and the journey is made circular. Also, the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family Reunion.|$|E
