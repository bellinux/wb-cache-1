5|$|Early grunge concerts were sparsely {{attended}} (many by {{fewer than}} a dozen people) but Sub Pop photographer Charles Peterson's pictures helped <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that such concerts were major events. Mudhoney, which was formed by former members of Green River, served as the flagship band of Sub Pop during their entire time with the label and spearheaded the Seattle grunge movement. Other record labels in the Pacific Northwest that helped promote grunge included C/Z Records, Estrus Records, EMpTy Records and PopLlama Records.|$|E
5|$|The church, {{which is}} a main {{location}} for the film, was substantially set-dressed. Despite having several original medieval wall paintings, the largest addition {{was the creation of}} the medieval mural by artist Margot Noyes. To <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of an austere country church, Victorian stone flags were replaced with brick pavers for the duration of filming and the original wall paintings covered up. Plastic guttering and other modern additions were covered up or removed. The churchyard had several gravestones added, including the large box tomb {{which is a}} focus of several scenes.|$|E
5|$|The episode's opening scene, {{featuring}} a camera moving slowly towards Scully in a harsh white light, {{was achieved by}} constructing a long narrow set covered in aluminium foil, which amplified the light being used and downplayed any colors. This shot was drained of color entirely, and was combined {{with a series of}} blurring and framing effects in post-production to further enhance the intended image—to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of waking from a dream.|$|E

5|$|Larger ships {{often had}} false bows and sterns painted in a {{different}} shade {{from the rest of}} the hull to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of the ship being at greater range from the observer. German decks were a very dark gray. Smaller ships operating in the North Sea or Baltic Sea were painted white or a very pale gray to blend in with daytime mist and nighttime phosphorescent organisms. As in the First World War, the Germans again employed disguised commerce raiders, Hilfskreuzer such as Atlantis, Thor and Kormoran. These ships were able to modify their appearance to throw off the searching Allied cruisers.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the disc}} is an {{involucre}} of modified leaves, the bracts, which in Xerochrysum, {{as in most}} Gnaphalieae, are petal-like, stiff, and papery. Arranged in rows, these bracts curl over and enclose the florets, shielding them before flowering. They <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of a shiny and yellow corolla around the disc. The intermediate bracts are sometimes white, while the outer ones are paler and often streaked reddish or brown (a greater variety of colours are found in cultivars). These bracts are papery and dry, or 'scarious', with a low water content, unlike leaves or flower parts of other plants. They {{are made up of}} dead cells, which are unusual in that they have a thin primary and a thick secondary cell wall, a feature only found in sclerenchyma, or structural, cells, not cells of flowers or leaves.|$|E
5|$|Word of Lamellerie's {{preparations}} reached Collingwood, and {{he planned}} a ruse {{to lure the}} French frigate squadron out into open water. Withdrawing all the large vessels of the blockade squadron, Collingwood kept only the 36-gun frigate HMS Hydra and the 18-gun sloop HMS Moselle in position to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that the principal blockading force had been driven off. This it was hoped would draw Lamellerie into {{an attack on the}} lone ships that would allow the rest of Collingwood's squadron, hidden just beyond the horizon, to counterattack and annihilate the French squadron. However, on 23 February a strong westerly wind blew up and the main squadron, Hydra and Moselle were all blown too far to the east. This was spotted by lookouts on shore and Lamellerie took the opportunity to leave port on 26 February, while the British ships were still out of position.|$|E

While Shannon {{was ordered to}} go slow due to her pregnancy, Sean chose to drive conservatively, <b>creating</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> to Sgt. Andrews that he is too slow. On the other hand, Henrietta and Michael both drive quickly. Henrietta, however, gets stuck going up a hill, while Michael believes he may be too slow to react. Jodi shows dramatic improvement, and <b>created</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that she was experienced at driving off-road.|$|R

5|$|To divert German {{troops from}} the Anzio {{landings}} (Operation Shingle), the Fifth Army was ordered to advance towards Cassino and Frosinone before 22 January, D-Day for the operation. To provide a reserve for the army group, the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn to the Naples area. The division {{became part of the}} ad hoc New Zealand Corps after its reinforcement by the 4th Indian Division and the regiment was posted above the Volturno River around the village of Raviscanina. Arriving on 22 January, it moved forward to an assembly area at Stazione di Toro on 6 February. The Fifth Army advance had stalled and the 2nd New Zealand Division moved into the line. Three days later the regiment replaced the 21st Battalion on the Gari river, opposite Sant'Angelo. On 15 February, the Benedictine monastery on Monte Cassino was bombed and two days later the Maori Battalion attacked the Cassino railway station. There was only enough space for a two-company advance, so Divisional Cavalry and 24th Battalion machine-gunned and mortared the area to their front to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of a larger attack. The regiment laid down a mortar barrage on its front to screen the Maoris with smoke. The Maori Battalion advanced to the railway station but was forced back over the Rapido in the late afternoon. Div Cav moved out of the line to Monte Trocchio on 23 February and was relieved by the 1st Battalion, East Surrey Regiment from the British 78th Division. On 15 March, the Monte Cassino assault resumed, and C Squadron kept the Route 6 bridge over the Gari-Rapido shrouded from German observation with smoke. The regiment pulled out of the line on 20 March, taking up the new left flank of New Zealand Division along the Gari River and was relieved on 9 April by the 22nd Battalion.|$|E

25|$|A further {{line in the}} {{directive}} stressed the need to inflict the heaviest losses possible, but also to intensify the air war in order to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> an amphibious assault on Britain was planned for 1941. However, meteorological conditions over Britain were not favourable for flying and prevented an escalation in air operations. Airfields became water-logged and the 18 Kampfgruppen (bomber groups) of the Luftwaffes Kampfgeschwadern (bomber wings) were relocated to Germany for rest and re-equipment.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{efficient}} activities of the spy in the union during a strike is to wreck the strike relief benefit fund, upon which, of course, {{the success of the}} strike so largely depends. If the spy cannot himself have access to the fund, his next policy is to spread discontent and cause the strikers to demand higher benefits than the union is able to pay. He will frequently <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that the fund is dishonestly handled by the union officials.|$|E

25|$|Slate Magazines Julia Turner compares Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince to the War on Terror in {{the context}} of the fight against Osama bin Laden saying Voldemort takes up {{terrorism}} by destroying bridges, murdering innocents, and forcing children to kill their elders. She also notes the parallels in the community's response saying Fred and George Weasley's shop makes a mint selling Shield Cloaks and the new Minister of Magic jails an innocent man, hoping to stave off panic and <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that he's taking action.|$|E
25|$|Before the film's release, {{its title}} was changed from Rapunzel to Tangled, {{reportedly}} {{to market the}} film as gender-neutral. Tangled spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $260 million, which if accurate, would make it the most expensive animated film ever made and the fifth most-expensive film of all time. The film employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional animation while using non-photorealistic rendering to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of a painting. Composer Alan Menken, who had worked on prior Disney animated features, returned to score Tangled.|$|E
25|$|Bonsai growers {{create or}} shape dead wood using {{techniques}} such as jin and shari to simulate age and maturity in a bonsai. Jin is the term used when the bark from an entire branch is removed to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of a snag of deadwood. Shari denotes stripping bark from areas of the trunk to simulate natural scarring from a broken limb or lightning strike. In addition to stripping bark, deadwood techniques may also involve the use of tools to scar the deadwood or to raise its grain, {{and the application of}} chemicals (usually lime sulfur) to bleach and preserve the exposed deadwood.|$|E

25|$|Many creationists {{strongly}} oppose certain scientific {{theories in}} a number of ways, including opposition to specific applications of scientific processes, accusations of bias within the scientific community, and claims that discussions within the scientific community reveal or imply a crisis. In response to perceived crises in modern science, creationists claim to have an alternative, typically based on faith, creation science, or intelligent design. The scientific community has responded by pointing out that their conversations are frequently misrepresented (e.g. by quote mining) in order to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of a deeper controversy or crisis, and that the creationists' alternatives are generally pseudoscientific.|$|E
25|$|Clark {{and his men}} {{marched into}} Vincennes at sunset on February 23, {{entering}} the town in two divisions, one commanded by Clark and the other by Bowman. Taking advantage of a slight elevation of land which concealed his men but allowed their flags to be seen, Clark maneuvered his troops to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that 1,000 men were approaching. While Clark and Bowman secured the town, a detachment was sent to begin firing at Fort Sackville after their wet black powder was replaced by local resident François Busseron. Despite the commotion, Hamilton did not realize the fort was under attack until one of his men was wounded by a bullet coming through a window.|$|E
25|$|Le Chahut is a {{conspicuous}} example of Seurat’s pointillist technique. The modulation {{of light and}} shadow throughout the work is obtained by the use of small dots of color juxtaposed side by side while alternating in both intensity and concentrations. The dots are meant to fuse {{in the eye of the}} viewer to <b>create</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of mixed colors when observed from a distance. While the Impressionists had focused their attention on the harmony of colors based on similar or related hues (only partially separated), the Neo-Impressionists harmony had been based on contrasting hues, pitted one against the other; resulting in a vibrating mélange optique (the optical mixture in the observer's eye).|$|E
