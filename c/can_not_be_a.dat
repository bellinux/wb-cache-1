25|$|For example, {{the small}} stellated dodecahedron has 12 pentagram faces {{with the central}} {{pentagonal}} part hidden inside the solid. The visible parts of each face comprise five isosceles triangles which touch at five points around the pentagon.

The hidden inner pentagons are no longer part of the polyhedral surface, and can disappear. Now the Euler's formula holds: 6090+32=2.

2500|$|The {{essence of}} Iblis {{has been a}} {{discussion}} subject among scholars. Some hold him to be an angel, a Jinn or neither an angel nor a jinni, but created from fire alone. In terms of its essence, there are different criteria that are discussed. Since the command to prostrate addressed to the angels, and his stay in heaven, he occurs as an angel. On the other hand, the Quran calls him a Jinni in Surah 18:50. Some scholars prefer a metaphorical reading on this vers, thus its describing Iblis' actions ("he hid obedience from God") or read [...] "Jinni", not as creature, but as meaning [...] "one who came from Jannah" [...] (from the verbal root: [...] ).. Another criteria, based on hadithtraditions, Angels are generally created from light, and Jinn from a sort of fire, however based on traditions from Muhammed's companions, some angels are an exception and also made from fire, therefore Tabari stated, his origin from fire should not distract from accepting at least Iblis original identity as an angel. Other scholars regarding his creation from fire [...] indicates light and fire are akin, and light actually originated from fire, thus fire and light {{should not be taken}} too precise. Additionally, some scholars argue [...] if he was an angel, he couldn't disobey God's command, stating angels strictly follow God's instructions, therefore he <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> real angel, while other scholars assert, angels may commit errors, for example by doubting or opposing the creation of humans.|$|E

It is a contradiction in terms. A can only rise in value by exchanging for a greater quantity of B and C; in which case these must exchange for a smaller quantity of A. All things can not rise relatively to one another. If one half of the commodities in the market rise in exchange value, the very terms imply a fall of the other half; and, reciprocally, the fall implies a rise. Things which are exchanged for one another can no more all fall, or all rise, than a dozen runners can each outrun all the rest, or a hundred trees all overtop one another. A general rise or a general fall of prices is merely tantamount to an alteration in the value of money, and is a matter of complete indifference, save in so far as it affects existing contracts for receiving and paying fixed pecuniary amounts.|$|E
6000|$|... § 2. It is evident, in {{the first}} place, that Sociology, {{considered}} as a system of deductions a priori, <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> science of positive predictions, but only of tendencies. We {{may be able to}} conclude, from the laws of human nature applied to the circumstances of a given state of society, that a particular cause will operate in a certain manner unless counteracted; but we can never be assured to what extent or amount it will so operate, or affirm with certainty that it will not be counteracted; because we can seldom know, even approximately, all the agencies which may co-exist with it, and still less calculate the “collective result” of so many combined elements. The remark, however, must here be once more repeated, that knowledge insufficient for prediction may be most valuable for guidance. It is not necessary for the wise conduct of the affairs of society, no more than of any one’s private concerns, that {{we should be able to}} foresee infallibly the results of what we do. We must seek our objects by means which may perhaps be defeated, and take precautions against dangers which possibly may never be realized. The aim of practical politics is to surround any given society with the greatest possible number of circumstances of which the tendencies are beneficial, and to remove or counteract, as far as practicable, those of which the tendencies are injurious. A knowledge of the tendencies only, though without the power of accurately predicting their conjunct result, gives us to a considerable extent this power.|$|E
60|$|Among the {{impediments to}} the general acknowledgment, by {{thoughtful}} minds, of the subjection of historical facts to scientific laws, the most fundamental continues to be that which is grounded on the doctrine of Free Will, or, in other words, on the denial that the law of invariable Causation holds true of human volitions; for if it does not, the course of history, being the result of human volitions, <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> subject of scientific laws, since the volitions on which it depends can neither be foreseen, nor reduced to any canon of regularity even after they have occurred. I have discussed this question, as far as seemed suitable to the occasion, in a former chapter; and I only think it necessary to repeat, that {{the doctrine of the}} Causation of human actions, improperly called the doctrine of Necessity, affirms no mysterious nexus, or overruling fatality: it asserts only that men’s actions are the joint result of the general laws and circumstances of human nature, and of their own particular characters; those characters again being the consequence of the natural and artificial circumstances that constituted their education, among which circumstances must be reckoned their own conscious efforts. Any one who is willing to take (if the expression may be permitted) the trouble of thinking himself into the doctrine as thus stated, will find it, I believe, not only a faithful interpretation of the universal experience of human conduct, but a correct representation of the mode in which he himself, in every particular case, spontaneously interprets his own experience of that conduct.|$|E

6000|$|Not that {{he looked}} as if he were a kind of Wilberforce at all; that {{superior}} merit, probably, was not his; nothing in his manner bespoke him righteous, but only good, and though to be good is much below being righteous, and though there is a difference between the two, yet not, it is to be hoped, so incompatible as that a righteous man <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good man; though, conversely, in the pulpit it has been with much cogency urged, that a merely good man, that is, one good merely by his nature, is so far from there by being righteous, that nothing short of a total change and conversion can make him so; which is something which no honest mind, well read in the history of righteousness, will care to deny; nevertheless, since St. Paul himself, agreeing in a sense with the pulpit distinction, though not altogether in the pulpit deduction, and also pretty plainly intimating which of the two qualities in question enjoys his apostolic preference; I say, since St. Paul has so meaningly said, that, [...] "scarcely for a righteous man will one die, yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die;" [...] therefore, when we repeat of this gentleman, that he was only a good man, whatever else by severe censors may be objected to him, it is still to be hoped that his goodness will not at least be considered criminal in him. At all events, no man, not even a righteous man, would think it quite right to commit this gentleman to prison for the crime, extraordinary as he might deem it; more especially, as, until everything could be known, there would be some chance that the gentleman might after all be quite as innocent of it as he himself.|$|E
6000|$|The {{reviewer}} says, that if {{the major}} premise included the [...] conclusion, “we {{should be able to}} affirm the conclusion without the [...] intervention of the minor premise; but every one sees that that is [...] impossible.” A similar argument is urged by Mr. De Morgan (Formal [...] Logic, p. 259): “The whole objection tacitly assumes the [...] superfluity of the minor; that is, tacitly assumes we know Socrates [...] (Mr. De Morgan says ‘Plato,’ but to prevent confusion I have kept to [...] my own exemplum.) to be a man as soon as we know him to be [...] Socrates.” The objection would be well grounded if the assertion [...] that the major premise includes the conclusion, meant that it [...] individually specifies all it includes. As, however, the only [...] indication it gives is a description by marks, we have still to [...] compare any new individual with the marks; and to show that this [...] comparison has been made, is the office of the minor. But since, by [...] supposition, the new individual has the marks, whether we have [...] ascertained him to have them or not; if we have affirmed the major [...] premise, we have asserted him to be mortal.

60|$|An error {{which seemed}} finally refuted and {{dislodged}} from thought, often needs only {{put on a}} new suit of phrases, to be welcomed back to its old quarters, and allowed to repose unquestioned for another cycle of ages. Modern philosophers have not been sparing in their contempt for the scholastic dogma that genera and species are a peculiar kind of substances, which general substances being the only permanent things, while the individual substances comprehended under them are in a perpetual flux, knowledge, which necessarily imports stability, can only have relation to those general substances or universals, {{and not to the}} facts or particulars included under them. Yet, though nominally rejected, this very doctrine, whether disguised under the Abstract Ideas of Locke (whose speculations, however, it has less vitiated than those of perhaps any other writer who has been infected with it), under the ultra-nominalism of Hobbes and Condillac, or the ontology of the later German schools, has never ceased to poison philosophy. Once accustomed to consider scientific investigation as essentially consisting in the study of universals, men did not drop this habit of thought when they ceased to regard universals as possessing an independent existence: and even those who went the length of considering them as mere names, could not free themselves from the notion that the investigation of truth consisted entirely or partly in some kind of conjuration or juggle with those names. When a philosopher adopted fully the Nominalist view of the signification of general language, retaining along with it the dictum de omni as the foundation of all reasoning, two such premises fairly put together were likely, if he was a consistent thinker, to land him in rather startling conclusions. Accordingly it has been seriously held, by writers of deserved celebrity, that the process of arriving at new truths by reasoning consists in the mere substitution of one set of arbitrary signs for another; a doctrine which they suppose to derive irresistible confirmation from the example of algebra. If there were any process in sorcery or necromancy more preternatural than this, I should be much surprised. The culminating point of this philosophy is the noted aphorism of Condillac, that a science is nothing, or scarcely any thing, but une langue bien faite; in other words, that the one sufficient rule for discovering the nature and properties of objects is to name them properly: as if the reverse were not the truth, {{that it is impossible to}} name them properly except in proportion as we are already acquainted with their nature and properties. Can it be necessary to say, that none, not even the most trivial knowledge with respect to Things, ever was or could be originally got at by any conceivable manipulation of mere names, as such; and that what can be learned from names, is only what somebody who used the names knew before? Philosophical analysis confirms the indication of common sense, that the function of names is but that of enabling us to remember and to communicate our thoughts. That they also strengthen, even to an incalculable extent, the power of thought itself, is most true: but they do this by no intrinsic and peculiar virtue; they do it by the power inherent in an artificial memory, an instrument of which few have adequately considered the immense potency. As an artificial memory, language truly is, what it has so often been called, an instrument of thought; but it is one thing to be the instrument, and another to be the exclusive subject upon which the instrument is exercised. We think, indeed, to a considerable extent, by means of names, but what we think of, are the things called by those names; and there <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> greater error than to imagine that thought can be carried on with nothing in our mind but names, or that we can make the names think for us.|$|E
