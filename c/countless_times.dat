5000|$|The {{experience}} of composing Kristallnacht prompted Zorn to explore his Jewish heritage and examine methods of composing using the Phrygian dominant scale.

Zorn explained: The project for Masada was to create something positive in the Jewish tradition something that maybe takes the idea of Jewish music into the 21st century the way jazz developed from the teens and 1920s into the '40s, the '50s, the '60s and on ...

25|$|The band's {{influence}} can be felt {{in ambient}} artists such as Deepspace, The Future Sound of London, David Kristian, and Global Communication, as well as rock, pop, and dance artists such as Radiohead, Porcupine Tree, M83, DJ Shadow, Ulrich Schnauss, Cut Copy, and Kasabian. The band also clearly influenced 1990s and 2000s Trance music, where lush soundscapes and synth pads are used along with repetitive synth sequences, much like in their 1975 releases Rubycon and Ricochet, {{as well as some}} of their music from the early 1980s.

5000|$|In {{order to}} be more {{engaging}} to the series viewers, the designers spent <b>countless</b> <b>time</b> creating the game to fit in well with the storyline. This led the designers to create games that were inline with the show such as Lightsaber Dueling, and Starfighter. Also many of the levels {{brought up in the}} mini-games extended many of the episodes, and even introduced brand-new storylines, to fit in with the series. Another large effort on the game's creation was to create an art-style that gave the look and the feel of Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Also parts of the game were created for marketing material, such as SOE's collaboration on the original Ryloth campaign for the game and the gungan lightsaber, which promoted Hasbro's Join the Jedi marketing campaign. SOE even had two of their flash mini-games featured on Starwars.com, one of the two not being the original mini-game but using a base template from the game [...] "Rocket Rescue".|$|R
50|$|Most elves are {{effectively}} immortal unless killed in battle, or by disease or misadventure. The oldest known elf, Timmain, has lived at least 20,000 years by World of Two Moons' reckoning (the {{length of the}} elves' presence on the planet), and for <b>countless</b> <b>time</b> before her arrival on that planet. Wolfriders, however, because of their wolf blood, will eventually grow old and die - something that was forgotten during their conflict with humans {{because of the high}} mortality rate in that period. It is not known just how long a Wolfrider can live, but some have been known to survive for 3,000-3,500 years. This wolf trait can be removed by a healer, but such a profound excision of an inherent element of themselves is an option few Wolfriders find desirable. So far the only 'reverted' wolfriders are Skywise, in an act of desperation, and Windkin, who had his wolf blood removed in infancy. However, Suntop (later renamed Sunstream), though of Wolfrider descent, never had wolf blood; his twin sister Ember 'called' the wolf blood to herself in the womb.|$|R
5000|$|Mozi views {{aesthetics}} {{as nearly}} useless. Unlike Confucius, {{he holds a}} distinctive repulsion to any development in ritual music and the fine arts. Mozi takes some whole chapters named [...] "Against Music" [...] (非樂) to discuss this. Though he mentions that he does enjoy and recognize what is pleasant, he sees them of no utilization in terms of governing, or of the benefit of common people. Instead, since development of music involves man's power, it reduces production of food; furthermore, appreciation of music results in less time for administrative works. This overdevelopment eventually results in shortage of food, as well as anarchy. This is because manpower will be diverted from agriculture and other fundamental works towards ostentations. Civilians will eventually imitate the ruler's lusts, making the situation worse. Mozi probably advocated this idea {{in response to the}} fact that during the Warring States period, the Zhou king and the aristocrats spent <b>countless</b> <b>time</b> in the development of delicate music while ordinary peasants could hardly meet their subsistence needs. To Mozi, bare necessities are sufficient; resources should be directed to benefit man.|$|R
25|$|Crosby charted 23 Billboard {{hits from}} 47 {{recorded}} songs with the Andrews Sisters, whose Decca record sales were {{second only to}} Crosby's throughout the 1940s. Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne were his most frequent collaborators on disc from 1939 to 1952—a partnership that produced four million-selling singles: Pistol Packin' Mama, Jingle Bells, Don't Fence Me In, and South America, Take it Away. They made one film appearance together in Road to Rio singing You Don't Have to Know the Language, and sang together <b>countless</b> <b>times</b> on radio shows throughout the 1940s and 1950s. They appeared as guests on each other's shows quite often, {{as well as on}} many shows for the Armed Forces Radio Service during and after World War II.

25|$|Another rival of Tipperary is Cork in the Munster Championship. These {{teams have}} met 80 {{times in the}} championship, {{more than any other}} rivalry in hurling. They have also met them <b>countless</b> <b>times</b> in the National League and {{pre-season}} challenge tournaments. A Tipp and Cork Munster hurling final in Semple Stadium is often claimed by supporters of both counties to be the most traditional Munster final and the games between them are nearly always close. The draw and replay games of 1987 and 1991 and the 1949–1954 rivalry encapsulates this rivalry and the 1991 replayed final in Thurles is claimed {{to be one of the}} greatest Munster hurling finals. This is one of the few rivalries in the provincial championships that is contested by two teams of similar stature whose honours and titles complement each other on a fairly equal basis. Kilkenny and Wexford in hurling have major difference in titles and in football, Dublin and Meath also have a gap between their respective winnings. The football teams of Galway and Mayo enjoy a similar rivalry and whose honours are divided in equal measure.|$|E

In his insanity, Agrajag brings the Cathedral down around them. Arthur manages to escape unharmed, partially due to learning how to fly after falling and missing the ground while catching sight of a piece of luggage he had lost at a Greek airport years before. After collecting the suitcase, Arthur inadvertently comes across the flying party and rejoins his friends. Inside, they find Trillian, but they are too late to stop the robots from stealing the Bail. Arthur, Ford, Trillian, and Slartibartfast return to the Bistromath and try to head off the robots activating the Wikkit Gate.|$|E
