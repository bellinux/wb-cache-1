40|$|Abstract Background The main {{objective}} of this work was to obtain a binary system of surface-active components (nonionic soap – alkaline and/or ammonium dodecylbenzenesulfonate) with potential competences in food hygiene, by accessing a scheme of classical reactions (<b>cyanoethylation,</b> total acid hydrolysis and stoichiometric neutralization with inorganic alkaline and/or organic ammonium bases) adapted to heterogeneously polyethoxylated nonylphenols (n[*]=[*] 3 - 20). In the processing system mentioned, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, initially the acid catalyst for the exhaustive hydrolysis of β-nonylphenolpolyethyleneoxy (n[*]=[*] 3 - 20) propionitriles, becomes together with the nonionic soap formed the second surface-active component of the binary system. Results In the reaction scheme adopted {{the influence of the}} main operating (duration, temperature, molar ratio of reagents) and structural parameters (degree of oligomerization of the polyoxyethylene chain) on the processing yields for the synthetic steps was followed. The favorable role of the polyoxyethylene chain size is remarked, through its specific conformation and its alkaline cations sequestration competences on the yields of <b>cyanoethylation,</b> but also the beneficial influence of phase-transfer catalysts in the total acid hydrolysis step. The chemical stability of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSH) at the temperature and strongly acidic pH of the reaction environment is confirmed. The controlled change of the amount of DBSH in the final binary system will later confer it potential colloidal competences in food hygiene receipts.

However, this activation is poorer than with other nucleophiles or Michael acceptors. The amidinoethylation makes available 3 -alkoxy-N,N'-substituted-amidines not easily accessible by other classical methods.

This study consists in modifying cellulose by grafting of the amidoxime groups for its use in the adsorption of the Cu 2 +, Cr 3 + and sulphide ions present in industrial waste waters. Cellulose is an abundant biodegradable polymer. The amidoxime groups are strong complexants of metal ions. The grafting is achieved in two steps: <b>cyanoethylation</b> and amidoximation, confirmed by FT-IR. The optimum conditions and the parameters influencing the two reactions are determined by the kjeldahl's method and by FT-IR.

Pyridine 5, however, was found not to catalyze the addition of trichlorosilane to styrene, 1 -octene, or vinyltrichlorosilane.

40|$|Polyammoniumcations {{have been}} used as DNA {{targeting}} ligands for a variety of DNA active reagents, for example radioprotectors and anti-tumour antibiotics, which do not rely on sequence specific binding for their activity. It is proposed that these ligands have a high affinity for DNA but exhibit an external (or loose) electrostatic binding interaction which enables them to remain mobile along DNA without dissociation of the drug: DNA complex. Polyammoniumcations based on the polytetraalkylammonium and polyprotonated ammonium salts of the naturally occurring polyamines spermine and spermidine were prepared. The synthesis of drug-ligand conjugates requires either selective mono-protection or mono-derivatisation of polyamines. These syntheses are problematic because of the combination of primary and secondary amine centres encountered and difficulties in handling the polyamines. Two strategies for achieving selective derivatisation were explored: the total synthesis of protected polyamines and selective protection of commercially available polyamines. Particularly successful were synthesis based on the successive <b>cyanoethylation</b> of benzylamine with protection of the intermediate amines and selective mono-derivatisation with tosylchloride, BOC-ON and episulphide. Model compounds were used to probe the nature of the polyammonium cation: DNA complex in solution by nmr and esr spectroscopy.

The methylation of 6 -hydroxyindazole by methyl iodide and dimethyl sulphate under alkaline conditions and by diazomethane under acidic and neutral conditions, gave 6 -methoxyindazole and 6 -methoxy- 2 -methylindazole, It was found that the addition of nitrobenzene doubled the yield of 6 -methoxyindazole in the Dennler Frasca synthesis. A convenient synthesis of 1, 2 -dimethylindazoline, via 1, 2 -dimethyl- 3 -iodoindazolium iodide, was accomplished in good yield. 6 -Nitroindazole hydroformlated at 20 yielded l-hydroxymethyl- 6 -nitroindazole, whilst at 60 it gave solely l-methoxymethyl- 6 -nitroindazole. <b>Cyanoethylation</b> gave both the 1 - and 2 - isomers.

40|$|Date de redaction: 31 janvier 2013. In {{this thesis}} I present my most {{relevant}} research work I performed {{as a main}} author from 2002 until these days {{in the field of}} Catalysis by Oxides by grouping it on a thematic basis. Consequently, each chapter in Section A presents a research direction which corresponds to several papers. I tried to avoid technical details in the text and illustrate the main ideas using results and their discussion. It is worth noting that the results presented here were mainly obtained in the Laboratory of Chemical Technology and Catalysis from the University of Bucharest but also in laboratories abroad where I worked or we are collaborating with. Chapter I presents the most relevant of my results {{on the subject of the}} oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes following two main directions: i) enhancing the ODH selectivity of highly active catalysts and ii) developing new effective catalysts for ODH of light alkanes. Thus, we have shown that the ODH reaction of n-butane over highly active and selective TiP 2 O 7 catalysts can be further improved by addition of CO 2 in the feed and that phosphating ceria produces an increase in ODH selectivity mainly at the expense of total oxidation products. We studied new rare earth and transition metal-containing mixed-oxides obtained from layered double hydroxides (LDH) precursors as ODH catalysts. We have shown first that the use of the LDH-derived Mg-containing mixed oxides as catalysts in the ODH reaction favored the desorption of alkenes, and, consequently, improved the ODH selectivity. Among them the Co-containing system was the most active and selective for propane ODH. In this case we have shown that the well-dispersed cobalt species with tetrahedral coordination played a main role in the ODH reaction of propane into propene, the highest propene yields being obtained with the catalysts containing 7. 5 - 9 at % Co with respect to cations. Chapter II is dedicated to the study of total oxidation of short-chain alkanes over different novel oxide-based catalysts with the aim of finding highly active catalysts for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) destruction, capable to replace the precious metal catalysts presently used. Thus, we have studied Pb and Ba titanates, LDH-derived transition metal-containing mixed oxides and Ni and Co ferrospinels. The most active and stable catalyst in the total oxidation of methane was the LDH-derived Cu-containing system. In this case we have shown that the active sites were the highly reducible copper species, their optimum dispersion being observed for the catalyst containing ~ 12 at % Cu with respect to cations. We have also shown for the first time that Co ferrite was highly active and stable in the total oxidation of propane as a VOC model. Chapter III is focussed on the study of oxidation catalysts by electrical conductivity measurements, a powerful technique for catalysts characterization that can provide information on the nature of surface oxidizing species, of structure defects and of the oxidic phase involved in the catalytic reaction which allows us to explain the catalytic behavior of the catalysts studied and to propose a reaction mechanism. Thus, we studied by electrical conductivity measurements ceria and phosphated ceria, catalysts for isobutane ODH, Pb and Ba titanates, catalysts for methane total oxidation, and vanadium antimonate and mixed vanadium and iron antimonate, catalysts for propane ammoxidation, the relationship existing between their redox and catalytic properties being evidenced and their catalytic behavior explained. Chapter IV is devoted to the study of catalytic processes involving the acid-base properties of the catalyst, such as conversion of ethanol into higher added value products over LDH-derived mixed oxides, <b>cyanoethylation</b> of methanol over transition-metal containing Mg-Al hydrotalcites and their corresponding mixed oxides and esterification of n-butanol with acetic acid over almina-supported molibdena and vanadia catalysts. Thus, we have shown that the Pd-containing LDH-derived mixed oxide was active for ethanol conversion into n-butanol while the Cu-based catalyst oriented the transformation towards n-butanol or 1, 1 -diethoxyethane depending on the reaction conditions and on the copper content. In the <b>cyanoethylation</b> reaction of methanol MgAlO system showed the best catalytic performances which diminished after introduction of the transition metal cations, the equilibrium between basic and acid sites being a key factor. Finally, we have shown that molybdena supported on γ-alumina acts as an efficient stable solid acid catalyst for the esterification of acetic acid with n-butanol, while vanadia supported on γ-alumina loose its activity because of the leaching of the active component. In Section B a plan for my research and academic career development is emphasized, different research topics in the field of Catalysis by Oxides that I intend to tackle in the future being described and justified based on a literature survey...|$|E
40|$|The studies {{reported}} in this thesis describe the use of Perloza type MT beaded cellulose resin as an insoluble support for solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). The overall aim {{of the project was}} to develop a viable methodology for the synthesis of peptide-ligands directly onto Perloza for use as matrices for affinity chromatographic processes. A number of basic studies were carried out to define the solvent compatibility of Perloza. Perloza appeared to be swollen by a variety of solvents currently used for SPPS, in particular by dimethylformamide (DMF) and dioxane. It was found that Perloza could not be dried and then re-swollen to its original volume using water, DMF, dioxane, or several other solvents. Therefore, it was necessary that Perloza was maintained in a solvent-swollen state for all of the other {{studies reported}} in this thesis. Several methods for generation of amine-functionalised Perloza were investigated. The chosen method was reaction of Perloza with acrylonitrile in a 1 : 1 solution of dioxane: 2 % w/v NaOH to yield cyanoethyl Perloza. The level of <b>cyanoethylation</b> of the resin was controllable between the range of 0 - 3. 7 mmole CN per gram of dry resin. The cyanoethyl Perloza was reduced with an excess of diborane in THF solution, either at room temperature or under reflux, to yield aminopropyl Perloza. Reduction yields varied from 52 - 100 %. The peptide LAGV was synthesised onto aminopropyl Perloza using modified Boc SPPS methodology. It was found that protic Boc cleavage reagents gave cleavage of aminopropyl groups from functionalised Perloza. Therefore, a novel Boc cleavage reagent, boron trifluoride etherate in dioxane, was developed for Boc cleavage in all subsequent peptide syntheses using Perloza and the Boc methodology. C-terminal Boc-amino acids were anchored to α-bromoacetamido Perloza by nucleophilic displacement of bromine via the Boc-amino acid cesium salts. The procedure resulted in anchoring of the Boc-amino acids via an acid-stable but base-labile glycolamide linkage. Two test peptides, LAGV, and Leu-enkephalin (sequence: YGGFL), were synthesised on Perloza using a semimanual LKB Biolynx 4175 continuous flow peptide synthesiser. The peptides were cleaved using dilute NaOH solution. The tyrosine hydroxyl of Leu-enkephalin was protected as its benzyl ether, which was cleaved by catalytic hydrogenation prior to HPLC purification. The peptides were obtained in satisfactory yield after purification by HPLC. Several unsuccessful attempts were made to synthesise the Acyl Carrier Protein 65 - 74 sequence (VQAAIDYING) using Perloza, the glycolamide linkage, and Boc chemistry. The glycolamide linker was also investigated for use with Perloza and Fmoc chemistry. Leu-enkephalin was synthesised using Fmoc chemistry. The tBu ether protecting the side chain hydroxyl of the tyrosine was cleaved using 95 % TFA while the peptide was left anchored to the Perloza. The peptide was then cleaved using the lithium salt of βME in THF. The cleavage yield of the peptide was low, about 32 %. In addition, {{it was found that the}} Perloza was difficult to filter after the treatment with TFA, that is, its flow properties had been impaired. Leu-enkephalin with the side chain hydroxyl of the tyrosine protected as a tBu ether was obtained by cleavage of the peptide with LiβME in THF. This provided preliminary evidence that side-chain protected peptides (for further use in fragment syntheses) could be obtained using the glycolamide linker with Perloza. The Fmoc SPPS methodology was also investigated for use with Perloza. Fmoc-amino acids were anchored to aminopropyl Perloza via the 4 -hydroxy-methylphenoxyacetyl (HMPA) linker using the preformed Fmoc-amino acyl- 4 -oxymethylphenoxyacetic acid 2, 4 -dichlorophenyl esters. All 20 Fmoc-amino acids were anchored to Perloza at substitution levels suitable for SPPS (up to 0. 76 mmole amino acid per g of dry resin). The amide linker compound p-[(R,S) -α-(9 H-fluoren- 9 -yl) -methoxyformamido- 2, 4 -dimethoxy-benzyl]-phenoxyacetic acid was coupled to aminopropyl Perloza for syntheses of peptide amides. Both a semimanual continuous flow (LKB Biolynx 4175) and automated batchwise peptide synthesiser (ABI 430 A) were used to carry out peptide syntheses. Little difference was seen in the quality of crude peptides derived from the two synthesisers. TFA solutions containing scavengers were used to cleave all peptides. It was found in all cases that treatment of peptide-Perloza with TFA seriously degraded the properties of the resin, in some cases the resin dissolved into the TFA. The peptides were purified by HPLC. Several peptides (LHRH, ACTH 4 - 11, Angiotensins I and II) were synthesised on Perloza and compared with authentic samples obtained from a commercial source. In addition, a number of non-standard peptides, up to 21 amino acids in length, were successfully synthesised using the Fmoc SPPS methodology with Perloza. Two peptide-ligands were synthesised directly onto aminopropyl Perloza for testing of the peptide-Perloza conjugates as affinity matrices for biomolecule purifications. VdLPFFVdL-amidopropyl Perloza was synthesised using Boc chemistry. The peptide-Perloza was tested for binding of chymosin. It was found that chymosin would not bind to the peptide-Perloza conjugate without succinylation of the N-terminal amine group. The peptide-Perloza was used for the affinity isolation of recombinant chymosin from a solution containing a number of contaminant fungal proteins. The side chain protected peptide luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (protected LHRH, sequence pGlu-His(Trt) -Trp-Ser(tBu) -Tyr(tBu) -Gly-Leu-Arg(Mtr) -Pro-Gly-NH 2) was synthesised directly onto aminopropyl Perloza. The side chain protecting groups (Trt, 2 X tBu, Mtr) were cleaved quantitatively using an acidic reagent (80 % DCM, 16 % TFA, 1 % TMSBR, 1 % thioanisole, 1 % EDT, 1 % m-cresol), with insignificant cleavage of the peptide-ligand from the support, and no apparent impairment of the flow properties of the Perloza. The peptide-resin was then employed for the affinity isolation of antibodies to LHRH derived from a sheep immunised with LHRH conjugated to BSA. A search of the literature revealed that, in many cases, the C-terminal glycine-amide of LHRH was required for binding antibodies to LHRH. A novel means for directed immobilisation of peptide-ligands to α-bromo-acetamido Perloza was conceived and investigated in order to direct the C-terminal glycine amide into the aqueous phase. A cysteine-containing analogue of LHRH (Ac-Cys-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-Gly-NH 2) was synthesised using amide linker Perloza and Fmoc chemistry. The LHRH analogue was purified by HPLC. Reaction of a 1. 3 - 1. 5 X excess of the LHRH analogue with α-bromoacetamido Perloza in 0. 1 M NaHCO 3 solution resulted in anchoring of the peptide to the support via a stable thioether bond. The coupling reaction went in greater than 95 % yield in 1 - 2 hours. The peptide-Perloza conjugate was used for the successful isolation of antibodies to LHRH...|$|E
