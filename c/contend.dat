40|$|Abstract. Medium Access Control {{protocols}} {{proposed in}} the context of ad hoc networks primarily aim to control the medium access among <b>contending</b> nodes using some contention resolution schemes. However, these protocols do not necessarily guarantee a fair allocation of wireless medium among <b>contending</b> flows. Our objective in this paper is to adaptively adjust the flow-rates of <b>contending</b> flows, so that each gets fair access to the medium. This adaptive adjustment will also ensure high packet delivery ratio and optimal utilization of wireless medium. We use a deterministic approach to adaptively improve the performance of the suffered flows in the network through mutual negotiation between <b>contending</b> flows. In this paper we have also suggested the use of directional antenna to further reduce the contention between the flows in the wireless medium. The proposed scheme is evaluated on QualNet network simulator to demonstrate that our scheme guarantees fairness to all <b>contending</b> flows. ...|$|R

5|$|Although it is {{uncertain}} what role the Ten Commandments played in early Christian worship, evidence suggests they were recited during some services and used in Christian education. For example, the Commandments are included {{in one of the}} earliest Christian writings, known as the Teaching of the Twelve Apostles or the Didache. Scholars <b>contend</b> that the Commandments were highly regarded by the early Church as a summary of God's law. The Protestant scholar Klaus Bockmuehl believes that the Church replaced the Commandments with lists of virtues and vices, such as the seven deadly sins, from 400–1200. Other scholars <b>contend</b> that throughout Church history the Commandments have been used as an examination of conscience and that many theologians have written about them. While evidence exists that the Commandments were part of catechesis in monasteries and other venues, there was no official Church position to promote specific methods of religious instruction during the Middle Ages. The Fourth Lateran Council (1215) was the first attempt to remedy this problem. Surviving evidence reveals that some bishops' efforts to implement the Council's resolutions included special emphasis on teaching the Commandments in their respective dioceses. Centuries later, the lack of instruction in them by some dioceses formed the basis of one of the criticisms launched against the Church by Protestant reformers.|$|E
