5|$|The new <b>camera</b> {{will allow}} Hubble to take large-scale, {{extremely}} clear and detailed photos over {{a wider range}} of colors than the old <b>camera</b> did. After the installation, controllers at the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center sent commands to the <b>camera</b> to perform an aliveness test, which passed, indicating the <b>camera</b> was installed correctly.|$|E
5|$|There {{are mainly}} {{three types of}} <b>camera</b> systems. In fixed <b>camera</b> systems, the <b>camera</b> does not move at all and the system {{displays}} the player's character in a succession of still shots. Tracking cameras, on the other hand, follow the character's movements. Finally, interactive <b>camera</b> systems are partially automated and allow the player to directly change the view. To implement <b>camera</b> systems, video game developers use techniques such as constraint solvers, artificial intelligence scripts, or autonomous agents.|$|E
5|$|A Ganymede orbiter {{based on}} the Juno probe was {{proposed}} in 2010 for the Planetary Science Decadal Survey. Possible instruments include Medium Resolution <b>Camera,</b> Flux Gate Magnetometer, Visible/NIR Imaging Spectrometer, Laser Altimeter, Low and High Energy Plasma Packages, Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer, UV Imaging Spectrometer, Radio and Plasma Wave sensor, Narrow Angle <b>Camera,</b> and a Sub-Surface Radar.|$|E

50|$|Fake {{security}} <b>cameras</b> (or dummy <b>cameras,</b> simulated <b>cameras,</b> decoy <b>cameras)</b> are non-functional surveillance <b>cameras</b> {{designed to}} fool intruders, or anyone {{who it is}} supposedly watching. Those <b>cameras</b> are intentionally placed in a noticeable place, so passing people notice them and believe the area to be monitored by CCTV.|$|R
5|$|After having {{positioned}} {{to perform a}} visual inspection, the robot performs an acquisition with a pan-tilt-zoom <b>camera.</b> Several steps take place: pointing the <b>camera,</b> sensing the element to be inspected, if needed repointing and zooming with the <b>camera,</b> image acquisition and inspection. Image analysis is used on doors {{to determine whether they}} are open or closed; on {{the presence or absence of}} protection for certain equipment; the state of turbofan blades or the wear of landing gear tires.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{was shown}} footage of James Cameron's Avatar which sold {{him on the}} idea to shoot Resident Evil: Afterlife in digital 3D. He shot in high-definition with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 using Cameron's Fusion <b>Camera</b> System, or more {{specifically}} a Sony F35 <b>camera.</b> The crew spent two weeks in pre-production learning the 3D <b>camera</b> system. With a budget of about $60 million, principal photography took place for 55 days from September 29, 2009 to December. Filming in 3D added 20% to the budget. Roberts began filming his scenes on October 10, 2009. The final showdown scene was filmed for about six days. During production Jovovich accidentally shot out a $100,000 <b>camera.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{derivative}} genre termed machinima verite, from cinéma vérité, {{seeks to}} add a documentary and additional realism to the machinima piece. L.M. Sabo's CATACLYSM achieves a machinima verite style through displaying and recapturing the machinima video with a low resolution black and white hand-held video <b>camera</b> to produce a shaky <b>camera</b> effect. Other element of cinéma vérité, such as longer takes, sweeping <b>camera</b> transitions, and jump cuts may be included to complete the effect.|$|E

5|$|Before {{each game}} and single-player Conquest, players choose between Sports and Action <b>camera</b> views. Action view is a {{trailing}} third-person shot similar to {{looking over the}} player-character's shoulder, while Sports view is a spectator perspective similar that of a televised basketball game. Enclosed arenas are inaccessible when using Sports view. The <b>camera</b> view cannot be changed once single-player begins, so Conquest mode players in Sports view will not see the arenas they unlock. The Action view <b>camera</b> swings wildly and can be pulled back slightly in the menus.|$|E
5|$|Birdy was {{the first}} feature film to be {{partially}} shot with the Skycam, a computer-controlled, cable-suspended <b>camera</b> system created by Garrett Brown, inventor of the Steadicam. The Skycam had 100-foot high posts with four hanging wires controlled by a computer, and a lightweight Panavision <b>camera</b> with 200 feet of film hung {{at the center of}} the wires. The filmmakers intended to use the Skycam to fully depict Birdy's point of view during a fantasy sequence in which he imagines himself flying. However, they encountered difficulties with the Skycam, which would often malfunction. Although the Skycam proved successful on its first take, Parker insisted that the filmed footage be shot more rapidly. However, the <b>camera</b> system malfunctioned during its second take, after capturing 40 seconds of footage. This resulted in the <b>camera</b> operators shooting the remainder of the sequence with a Steadicam mounted on top of an improvised <b>camera</b> dolly.|$|E

5|$|In a {{panoramic}} <b>camera,</b> the focal-plane shutter {{was replaced by}} a rotation of 180° of the lens itself. This model was the basis for the Doppel-Sport Panoramic <b>Camera,</b> which Neubronner tried to market around 1910. It captured {{a panoramic}} view on 3cm×8cm film. It never went into serial production, though.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to religious allusions, the crew used color schemes and <b>camera</b> movements {{to create their}} own themes for the characters. Since the show was told from Clark's point of view, particular visual elements were utilized to illustrate a particular characteristic. When he was safe at home the colors used to illustrate the environment were warm and gentle, with an earth tone, while the <b>camera</b> movement was gentle as well. When Clark was keeping his secret, but there was no danger around, the lighting was more neutral, with greater <b>camera</b> movement. When there was danger, the lighting became colder with more grays and blues, and the <b>camera</b> shifted to a handheld, allowing more extreme angles.|$|E

5|$|Many fans wanted Snake Eater {{to use a}} 3D <b>camera,</b> {{but this}} was {{ultimately}} not implemented in the game. Kojima views Metal Gear Solid, Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater as a trilogy, and wished to keep the <b>camera</b> {{the same as the}} previous two {{in order to keep the}} feel of the three games the same. He did, however, acknowledge that the current trend for video games is to use the 3D <b>camera.</b> The <b>camera</b> was later implemented in an updated version of Snake Eater titled , and further installments in the franchise.|$|E

Bissell theorized that the appearance of the players draws fans attention more than their actual athleticism.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One is {{equipped}} with a 4.0-megapixel rear-facing <b>camera</b> module that contains a custom image sensor marketed as UltraPixel, which is composed of pixels that are 2.0µm in size. Most high-end smartphones {{at the time of its}} release used 8- or 13-megapixel cameras with pixel sizes ranging from 1.4 to 1.0µm, both of which are considerably smaller in size than the pixels found in the One’s UltraPixel sensor. Although these smaller pixel sizes were typically necessary to ensure that the <b>camera</b> sensor did not compromise the design of the phone, there were concerns that this could result in a loss of dynamic range and sensitivity, and also result in poor performance in low-light environments. As such, HTC stated that its <b>camera</b> design with larger sensor pixels could notably increase overall image quality, especially in low-light environments. The <b>camera</b> also includes optical image stabilization, and is further enhanced by improvements to the Sense <b>camera</b> software and the ImageChip 2 image processor.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The use {{of digital}} video <b>cameras</b> and digital still <b>cameras</b> is {{becoming}} widespread. Digital video <b>cameras</b> differ from digital still <b>cameras</b> {{in a number}} of respects. Digital video <b>cameras</b> capture approximately thirty frames per second and are optimized to capture a large amount of moving images, but sacrifice image quality. Still digital <b>cameras</b> are less expensive because they have far less processing power and memory capacity than digital video <b>cameras.</b> Even with these limitations, some still digital <b>cameras</b> are also capable of capturing sequential images, such as a burst image. Accordingly, what is needed is a method and system for interactively creating a VIDEO from one or more still images...|$|R
