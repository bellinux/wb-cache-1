5000|$|The Lithuanian Red (Lietuvos žalieji) is a {{breed of}} cattle that {{was formed by}} {{crossing}} Danish Red cattle with the local Lithuanian cattle. In 1951 the cross was recognized as a new breed. It currently accounts for about 33% of the entire cattle population in Lithuania. The young stock of the Lithuanian Red breed are noted for their rapid growth rate, good food conversion and high carcass quality. When intensively fattened, steers weigh roughly 413 kilograms (911 pounds) as yearlings. [...] Management is performed by the Lithuanian Red <b>Cattle</b> <b>Improvement</b> Association according to the National Red <b>Cattle</b> <b>Improvement</b> Selection Program.

40|$|Bali cattle (Bos javanicus) {{account for}} about {{one quarter of the}} total cattle {{population}} in Indonesia and are particularly important in the smallholder farming enterprises of the eastern islands. The population of Bali cattle is declining in most areas of Eastern Indonesia because demand for beef cattle exceeds the local capacity to supply these animals. Indonesian agencies recognise that new strategies are required to improve the productivity of Bali cattle and to address major constraints relating to animal husbandry and nutrition. To date, the adoption of <b>cattle</b> <b>improvement</b> technologies has been historically slow in Indonesia, as is the case elsewhere. This paper reports on key findings from a long-term study conducted between 2001 and 2009 with smallholder households from six villages in South Sulawesi and Central Lombok, to develop and test an approach for evaluating and increasing the adoption of cattle and forage improvement technologies. The approach is based on the principles of farming systems and participatory research and involved four main steps; (1) benchmarking the current farming system; (2) identifying constraints to cattle production and strategies to address them; (3) desktop modelling of the production and economic impacts of selected strategies; and (4) on-farm testing of the most promising strategies with 30 participant smallholder households. The approach was found to be successful based on: (1) sustained adoption of a package of best-bet technologies by the 30 participating households; (2) evidence of positive production, social and economic impacts; and (3) significant diffusion of the <b>cattle</b> <b>improvement</b> technologies to other households in the project regions.

30|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to estimate calf growth, reproductive performance and milk yield of Ethiopia Sheko cattle and to assess non-genetic factors affecting their performance in their home tract as a step towards designing sustainable <b>cattle</b> conservation and <b>improvement</b> strategy. All the growth traits considered in the study were significantly affected by all non-genetic factors considered except for the fixed effects of Agro ecological zones (AEZs) and season of birth which were not significant for post weaning daily gain. Calving interval (CI) and days open (DO) were significantly influenced by AEZs, season and dam parity. Cows that calved in lowland had shorter CI and DO than cows which calved in midland. Cows that calved in short rainy season had Short CI and DO than those calved during dry season or long rainy season. Cows which calved for the first time had the longest CI and DO from the other parities whereas cows on their fifth parity had the shortest CI and DO. AEZ significantly affected lactation milk yield (LMY) and lactation length (LL), but not significant on daily milk yield (DMY) and 305  days yield (305 DY). Season was significant on all milk traits considered except DMY. Parity effect was significant on LMY and 305 DY, whereas DMY and LL were not affected.

40|$|Artificial {{selection}} {{has proven}} to be effective at altering the performance of animal production systems. Nevertheless, selection based on assessment of the genetic superiority of candidates is suboptimal as a result of errors in the prediction of genetic merit. Conventional breeding programs may extend phenotypic measurements on selection candidates to include correlated indicator traits, or delay selection decisions well beyond puberty so that phenotypic performance can be observed on progeny or other relatives. Extending the generation interval to increase the accuracy of selection reduces annual rates of gain compared to accurate selection and use of parents of the next generation at the immediate time they reach breeding age. Genomic prediction aims at reducing prediction errors at breeding age by exploiting information on the transmission of chromosome fragments from parents to selection candidates, in conjunction with knowledge on the value of every chromosome fragment. For genomic prediction to influence beef cattle breeding programs and the rate or cost of genetic gains, training analyses must be undertaken, and genomic prediction tools made available for breeders and other industry stakeholders.

40|$|In animal breeding, animals {{originating}} from different environments are often considered in selection decisions. Production data in these groups may differ both in mean and variance. In South Africa, yearling weights of beef cattle are recorded {{in two different}} phases of the National Beef <b>Cattle</b> <b>Improvement</b> Scheme (NBCIS). The {{aim of this study}} was to assess changes in the ranking of animals in the selection process where animals are selected on estimated breeding values (EBVs) for yearling weight before and after correcting for heterogeneity between the two phases. Yearling weights are measured in Phases B and D of the NBCIS. Yearling weights recorded in Phase D were adjusted according to the standard deviation and heritabilities of yearling weights in Phase B. To determine whether the adjustment was justified, two VCE REML analyses were performed on combined Phase B and D data to estimate breeding values. The first analysis involved unadjusted Phase D data, while the second run involved Phase D yearling weights, adjusted for heterogeneity. The ranking correlation between EBVs derived from the two runs, was 99 % indicating almost no re-ranked after adjustment.

However, infectious and parasitic diseases remain a major constraint to improved cattle productivity in the region. The use of animal health economics to support decision-making on cost-effective disease control options is increasingly becoming important in the developing world. Trypano-tolerant indigenous Orma / zebu cattle in a trypanosomosis-endemic area of Kenya were evaluated for economic performance using gross-margin analysis and partial-farm budgeting. Orma / zebu and Sahiwal / zebu cross-bred cattle were exposed to similar husbandry practices and monitored for growth rate, incidence of common infections (trypanosomosis, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, East Coast Fever and helminthosis) and the cost of treatment assessed. Interview questionnaires were also used to assess the preference rating of the 2 breeds. Results indicated that incidence of infection was trypanosomosis 3 %, anaplasmosis 58 %, babesiosis 11 %, East Coast Fever 22 % and helminthosis 28 %, with no significant difference between breeds.
