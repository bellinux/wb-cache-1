50|$|Treatment {{for higher}} grade CIN {{involves}} removal or {{destruction of the}} neoplastic cervical cells by <b>cryocautery,</b> electrocautery, laser cautery, loop electrical excision procedure (LEEP), or cervical conization. Therapeutic vaccines are currently undergoing clinical trials. The lifetime recurrence rate of CIN is about 20%, but it isn't clear what proportion of these cases are new infections rather than recurrences of the original infection.|$|E
5000|$|Cervical dyskaryosis is {{classified}} into three degrees of severity: mild, moderate and severe. A further category {{is used to}} define cells that do not show significant nuclear abnormality, {{and may not be}} described as 'dyskaryotic.' This category is termed epithelial cellular [...] "borderline changes". As dyskaryotic epithelium found in the cervix have malignant potential, most cases of dyskaryosis will typically be followed up and referred. The risk is increasingly high with higher grades of dyskaryosis. Most borderline changes will resolve spontaneously, as will many mild ones. Moderate and severe changes are usually treated, by electrocautery, <b>cryocautery</b> or loop excision, with the objective of completely removing the abnormal area.|$|E
40|$|Forty eyes in twenty-two {{cases in}} the active phase of {{retinopathy}} of prematurity were treated with laser photocagulation. Thiry (93. 7 %) of the 32 eyes in type I and intermediate type {{were found in the}} cicartrical phase grade 1. In type Ⅱ in which <b>cryocautery</b> was used as combination therapy, only 2 eyes (25. 0 %) were found in grade 1, 2 eyes (25. 0 %) in grade 2, 1 eye (12. 5 %) in grade 4 and 3 eyes (37. 5 %) in grade 5. All 21 eyes in which photocoagulation was performed up to the middle of stage 3 were found in grade 1 (100 %). However, among 11 eyes in which photocoagulation were performed in late stage 3, 9 eys (81. 8 %) were found in grade 1, and 2 eyes (18. 2 %) in grade 2. In conclusion, if adequate laser photocoagulation is performed in avascular ares at the middle of stage 3 of type Ⅰ and intermediate type, treatment in cicartrical phase grade 1 is possible. Laser photocoagulation is clearly more effective than the xenon are photocoagula-tion or <b>cryocautery.</b> However, in type Ⅱ it is difficult to control the condition by photocagulation alone, and early diagnosis followed by combination therapy using <b>cryocautery</b> is reqired...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Objectives The aim of {{the work}} is to study the {{possibilities}} for using a semiconductor device to cauterise bleeding by means of cooling (<b>cryocautery).</b> Method The study is based on methods for approximate modeling of heat exchange processes. Results The construction of a device for cauterisation of bleeding, the actuating element of which consists of a thermoelectric battery operating in cooling mode at the time of blood flow cautery and in heating mode when removing the device from the damaged area, is considered. A model of a device, realised {{on the basis of the}} solution of the problem of solidification of a viscous liquid by the method of L. S. Leibenson, is proposed, taking into account the electro- and thermo-physical characteristics of the thermoelectric battery cold source. As a result of the numerical experiment, the dependence of the duration of the ice crust formation on tissues 1 mm thick (which corresponds to the cauterisation of bleeding) is obtained on the value of the supply current of the thermoelectric battery. With increasing current, the duration of the ice crust formation is reduced; this can be of the order of 160 s at 5 A. It was demonstrated that the selection of thermoelectric battery parameters and current should be guided by medical norms and standards in order to avoid frostbite in the tissues adjacent to the bleeding zone. Conclusion The special design of thermoelectric device provides an effective technical means for cauterising bleeding by freezing (<b>cryocautery),</b> providing high intensity of cooling, shortenened thrombus formation duration, and eliminating painful sensations when removing the device from a damaged area.  </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} cyclocryocautery, using the Kelman Cryostylet, is described. On rabbit eyes this brings about a {{statistically}} significant lowering of intraocular pressure and reduction of aqueous flow over an observation period of three months. The effects upon the facility of outflow are variable. Side effects are minimal. The intraocular temperature was measured at various points during and after <b>cryocautery.</b> An applicator temperature of about - 40 ° C was found sufficient for the desired result with minimal side effects. Angiocryocautery of one or both long posterior ciliary vessels resulted only in a temporary reduction of intraocular pressure, as permanent obliteration of these vessels was not possible by this method. In a small series of eight patients with primary and secondary glaucomas, the procedure described was effective in six cases. Possible indications in other forms of glaucoma are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Objetivos: avaliação de fatores de risco [grau da lesão e associação com o vírus da imunodeficiência adquirida tipo 1 (HIV- 1) e gestação] para recidiva após tratamento de lesões provocadas pelo papilomavírus humano (HPV) no trato genital feminino. Material e métodos: foram avaliadas 70 pacientes com diagnóstico clínico, colposcópico e citológico de infecção pelo HPV. O seguimento clínico foi de no mínimo 6 meses após o tratamento inicial, possibilitando avaliar os resultados terapêuticos. Neste grupo, 26 pacientes eram grávidas, sendo 12 com sorologia positiva para o HIV- 1. As 44 pacientes restantes encontravam-se fora do período gravídico-puerperal, sendo que destas, 14 eram contaminadas pelo HIV- 1. Segundo os critérios citológicos as lesões de colo foram classificadas em alterações associadas ao HPV ou {{neoplasia}} intra-epitelial cervical (NIC) graus I (lesões de baixo grau) ou NIC II/III (lesões de alto grau). A análise estatística foi realizada pelo teste exato de Fisher com nível de significância para p Purpose: {{evaluation of}} the risk factors [lesion grade, seropositivity for type 1 acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV- 1) and association with pregnancy] for relapse of human papillomavirus (HPV) induced lesions of the female genital tract. Patients and Methods: seventy patients with a clinical, colposcopic and cytologic diagnosis of HPV infection were studied. Clinical follow-up lasted at least 6 months after the initial treatment, thus permitting the {{evaluation of the}} therapeutic results. Twenty-seven of these patients were pregnant and 12 were seropositive for HIV- 1. The remaining 44 patients were not in the pregnancy-puerperium cycle and 14 of them were HIV- 1 positive. According to cytologic criteria, the cervical lesions were classified as changes associated with HPV or grade I cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN I) (low grade lesions) or CIN II/III (high grade lesions). Data were analyzed statistically by the exact Fisher test, with the level of significance set at p< 0. 05. The therapeutic scheme for lesions limited to the uterine cervix was cryo- or electrocautery (EC), whereas topical 5 -fluorouracil was used for the diffused lesions through the vaginal wall. For the lesions in the vulvoperineal region, 80 % trichloroacetic acid was used, and when they were voluminous, EC was applied. Among the pregnant women, a <b>cryocautery</b> was used for lesions limited to the cervix and EC for diffuse lesions. Results: among the HIV- 1 -negative pregnant women there was an 87. 5 % rate of recurrence when the lesions were in the cervix-vagina, and no recurrence when the lesions were vulvoperineal. In contrast, seropositive pregnant women presented 100 % recurrence regardless of the site of the lesion. Among nonpregnant HIV negative women, 20 and 24 % recurrence was observed in the cervix-vagina and in the vulvoperineal region, respectively, as opposed to 87. 5 and 100 % recurrence, respectively, for the same regions among HIV positive women. The lesions associated with CIN showed a higher frequency of recurrence with increasing CIN grade and a synergistic effect with the association of HIV- 1 and pregnancy. Conclusions: the recurrence rate for women treated for HPV-induced lesions is high and the association with pregnancy, HIV and increased grade of the intraepithelial lesions are synergistic factors in the determination of therapeutic failure. The site of implantation of HPV-induced lesions is of prognostic significance only when the infection is not associated with HIV...|$|E
