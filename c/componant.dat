This test of the full chain of services -including the voltage supplies, opto-boards, cooling, temperature monitoring, control software, and the pixel modules themselves- {{is referred to as the}} Pixel System Test. The System Test took place in an above-ground laboratory setting at CERN and consisted of two main parts. The first half of the test focused on one of the pixel detector’s endcaps.

The main motivation behind {{this study was the}} need for a method to evaluate the (dis/re) assembly options of furniture designs to be able to facilitate repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, or recycling. The study draws upon relevant theories and prior research on Circular product Design, Design for EoL, Design for Environment, and Design for (Dis) assembly of vehicles, electrical and elocronic equipments, whitegoods, as well as office furniture, though relatively limited. The proposed methodology determines major aspects of design for (dis/re) assembly to be taken in to consideration {{in the early stages of}} product development. It further provides a set of parameters that are relevant to cabinet type and upholstery furniture group. The study involves a variety of qualitative research methods that are embedded in an interactive research conduct with the engagement of different stakeholders that are charged with the task of product development at Ikea of Sweden (IoS), the collaborator of this study.   The proposed methodology is implemented on three selected furniture designs in a pilot study.

40|$|International audienceRisk {{allocation}} in contracts is {{an important}} issue for both economics and law. It questions the theorerical, methodological, empirical foundations of economic and legal analysis. It also offers a valuable ground for comparative legal-economic inquiry. The article aims at providing some insights into that general perpective, and proceeds with an articulation of theoretical and empirical analysis. The paper first offers a critical analysis of some key economic basis hypothesis on law, contract law and legal institutions, notably the courts. It concentrates on various <b>componants</b> of the New Institutional Economics stream that are {{something to do with the}} notion of contractual incompletedness. The emphasis is put on two central issues : the contract-institutions relations, and the scope of incompleteness as a guide for empirical research into the economic dimensions of contract law. The second part of the article compares and evaluates the significance of the economic concept of incompletedness and theFrench legal notion of imprévision, which relates to a notion that the administrative courts have set-up to decide cases in which the occurrence of unforeseen events affects the contractual equilibria built ex ante. The analysis then moves toward the research of a legal and empirical translation of uncertainty of the future. The article argues that positive legal provisions in contract law enable co-contractors to set-up a framework in which the consequences unforeseen events can be adressed. Legal provisions such as those which relate to conditional duties, aleatory contracts, force majeure, fortious events, price revision, hardship, are examples of tools that allow a significant amount of previsibility in contractual relations, particularilly long-term contracts. We then offer an empirical analysis of a specific legal notion : the imprévision. The analysis is based on legal data, namely the French Conseil d'Etat decisions that deal with a request for compensation by the State of the economic consequences of the occurrence of unforeseen events for the suppliers. A descriptive statistical analysis is associated to a study of the doctrine that the State officials adress to contracting officers; a comparison of price determination provisions under American procurement and French law of “marchés publics” is then made. L'allocation des risques inhérents à l'exécution d'obligations dans des accords dont la temporalité est longue est une question importante, notamment pour l'économie. Or, à cet égard, il est significatif de constater que les entrées consacrées au droit administratif dans l'Encyclopedia of Law and Economics ne font pas mention des contrats administratifs, et que les entrées relatives au droit des contrats ne renvoient jamais au droit administratif. On ne peut que signaler, à ce propos, l'originalité de l'ouvrage de microéconomie des marchés publics et de la réglementation de J. -J Laffont et J. Tirole (1993). Quelles conclusions tirer de ce constat ? De notre point de vue, deux hypothèses peuvent être avancées : soit les économistes se désintéressent des contrats administratifs, soit ils les intègrent implicitement dans le même moule que les contrats de droit privé. Nous estimons que la deuxième hypothèse est la plus plausible, et nous souhaitons l'explorer ici en réfléchissant sur le fait de savoir si le droit positif des contrats privés et administratifs rend possible l'application de mêmes catégories d'analyse en matière d'allocation des risques. Cette question appelera naturellement une réflexion sur la signification et la portée empirique de la notion économique d'incomplétude des contrats...|$|R
40|$|Owing to its porous {{cellular}} structure and polymeric components, wood {{can be easily}} shaped in its transversal direction when it is heated and has sufficient water content. Thanks to this thermohydrous behaviour many manufacturing processes such as densification, moulding, shaping or bending can be considered. Thus, some mechanical properties like the hardness, the shear and tensile strength {{as well as the}} wood durability facing microorganisms are enhanced. However, the shape of this new material is not stable: it recovers its initial shape when remoistened. This phenomenon is called "shape memory " or "set-recovery" of shaped wood. Nevertheless, this problem can be solved by chemical and thermal treatments. This study focuses on thermo-hydrous treatments that allow the preservation of the ecological aspect of wood. The main objectives of this study are on one hand the better understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to decrease or to eliminate the densified wood during set-recovery thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) post-treatments, {{and on the other hand}} the optimization of the densification and THM post-treatment processes parameters and conditions. Preliminary, to better apprehend the elimination of the set-recovery, the origin of densified wood shape memory are revised. Many studies showed that the shape memory of wood originates from the inner stresses induced by the deformation of cellulose microfibrils and other <b>componants.</b> This deformation generates an increase of the material elastic energy. Under moisture and heat conditions the inner stresses are relaxed by the quasi-overall recovery of microfibrils set. During the set-recovery the lignin follows the microfibrils movement due to their bonding to cellulose microfibrils by hemicelluloses. So the cellular walls come almost to its initial shape, allowing stored elastic energy to be dissipated. The hemicelluloses take a fundamental part during set-recovery as they assure the cohesion between cellulose microfibrils and lignin by physico-chemical bonds. Consequently the dissipation of elastic energy during THM post-treatments is facilitated by the rupture of these bonds causing the set-recovery of cellulose microfibrils and lignin. A model of the hemicelluloses hydrolysis reaction has been carried out. A high correlation between the polymerisation degree of the hemicelluloses and the set-recovery of densified wood has been calculated by this model. The strong hydrolytic action on the hemicelluloses has also been confirmed by our physico-chemical analysis. Thus our model indicates that lignin must be in its rubber state to be able to eliminate totally the set-recovery. At higher temperatures (180 °C) the middle lamela becomes fragile due to the thermal degration and causes microcracks between the wood cells during the abrupt release of steam at the end of the post-treatment and during drying. These microcracks are also susceptible to be the source of the dissipation of elastic energy stored during the densification process. Finally, our results indicate that steam post-treatments are able to increase the cellulose crystallinity and the crystallites diameter. The decrease of the setrecovery can be also partially explained by these phenomena. With regard to densification and post-treatment THM conditions, the recovery tests results show an optimal temperature of densification at 110 °C under saturated vapour condition. Our mechanical tests testify a significant thermal damage from 180 °C. Thus the set-recovery elimination has to be done around 160 °C to avoid the intercellular microcracking problems when cooling and drying the samples. The post-treatment THM can be then a promising procedure to eliminate the set recovery for the industry. Nevertheless, further studies must be carried out for better understanding the cracking problem due to the drying process for bigger samples...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{numerical}} {{studies of}} the gluon propagator in the minimal Landau and Coulomb gauges in space-time dimension 2, 3, and 4 pose {{a challenge to the}} Gribov confinement scenario. We prove, without approximation, that for these gauges, the continuum gluon propagator D(k) in SU(N) gauge theory satisfies the bound d- 1 d 1 (2 π) ^d∫ d^dk D(k) k^ 2 ≤ N. This holds for Landau gauge, in which case d is the dimension of space-time, and for Coulomb gauge, in which case d is the dimension of ordinary space and D(k) is the instantaneous spatial gluon propagator. This bound implies that _k → 0 k^d- 2 D(k) = 0, where D(k) is the gluon propagator at momentum k, and consequently D(0) = 0 in Landau gauge in space-time d = 2, and in Coulomb gauge in space dimension d = 2, but D(0) may be finite in higher dimension. These results are compatible with numerical {{studies of the}} Landau-and Coulomb-gauge propagator. In 4 -dimensional space-time a regularization is required, and we also prove an analogous bound on the lattice gluon propagator, 1 d (2 π) ^d∫_- π^π d^dk ∑_μcos^ 2 (k_μ/ 2) D_μμ(k) 4 ∑_λsin^ 2 (k_λ/ 2) ≤ N. Here we have taken the infinite-volume limit of lattice gauge theory at fixed lattice spacing, and the lattice momentum <b>componant</b> k_μ is a continuous angle - π≤ k_μ≤π. Unexpectedly, this implies a bound on the high-momentum behavior of the continuum propagator in minimum Landau and Coulomb gauge in 4 space-time dimensions which, moreover, is compatible with the perturbative renormalization group when the theory is asymptotically free.

40|$|This {{report is}} part of a project {{studying}} the variation in the sensitivity of species to toxicant's. Patterns in the chronic toxicity of compounds to aquatic species are studied using a multivariate statistical technique called principal <b>componant</b> analysis. The matrix consists of 15 aquatic species and 22 compounds. The species belong to different taxonomic classes: algae, plants, protozoans, crustaceans, fishes and amphibians. The organic chemicals belong to several toxicological classes: nonpolar narcotics, polar narcotics, reactive compounds and compounds with a specific mode of action. Three heavy metals, a halogen and a detergent are also included. The data was obtained from the EPA-database Aquire and additional literature surveys. The results show that: The major part of matrix variation is determined by the overall toxicity of compounds and not by differences between species. The compounds can be ordered unambiguously by their average chronic toxicity. This is valid for all species considered and similar to results found earlier for acute toxicity data. No clear patterns in the sensitivity of the species are observed. Comparison with acute toxicity data shows that the ratio of acute to chronic toxicity is similar for all compounds and has a mean value of 4. For the acute to chronic ratio a 95 % confidence interval stretching from 1 to 50 has been calculated for the 13 compounds in this study where both acute and chronic toxicity data were available.

Such concentrators do not require tracking, and they can reduce the cost of solar energy conversion by reducing the required area of photovoltaic cells. We have conducted the following experimental and theoretical investigations in order to optimize the LSC's performance. The spectral characteristics of 18 organic laser dyes are studied for their applicability as luminescing centers. The spectral homogeneity and self-absorption characteristics of representative dyes are examined in detail. The relative spectral homogeneity of such dyes is shown to depend upon the surrounding material using narrow band laser excitation. We develop three independent techniques for measuring self-absorption rates; these are time-resolved emission, steady state polarization anisotropy, and spectral convolution. Prototype devices are tested for performance, and the <b>componant</b> dyes are tested for stability to solar exposure. A model is developed which predicts the efficiency and gain of and LSC from the spectroscopic characteristics of its components. A critical optical density (CODE) is assigned to the dyes surveyed which predicts the self-absorption limited performance for a particular dye. The maximum efficiency of an LSC is found using a simple model and the experimentally measured Stokes shift required to minimize self-absorption. We find that the performance of LSCs which achieve high light concentration is primarily limited by self-absorption and by photodegradation. The maximum efficiency possible is about 9 % in such systems, and present devices can achieve about 3 %. A typical lifetime for an LSC using organic laser dyes due to photodegradation is on the order of a month...|$|E
40|$|Scenario House, {{a gallery}} based installation, is {{comprised}} of a room constructed as a family room within a domestic space, a television with a looped video work and a sound <b>componant</b> played through a 5. 1 sound system. The paper is intended to give my work context {{in relation to the}} processes leading up to its completion. This is achieved through clarification of the basis for the installation including previous socio-political discourses within my art practice. It then focuses on ways that the installation Scenario House is based on gun practice facilities such as the Valhalla Shooting Club. Further it gives an explanation of the actual production, in context with other art practices. It was found that distinctions between war as a game and the actual event are being lost within simulation revenge scenarios where the borders distinguishing gaming violence, television violence and revenge scenarios are increasingly indefinable. War can then be viewed a spectacle where the actual event is lost in a simplified simulation. Scenario House as installation allows audience immersion through sound spatialisation and physical devices. Sound is achieved by design of a 5. 1 system played through a domestic home theatre system. The physical design incorporates the dual aspect of a gun shooting club and a lounge room. Further a film loop is shown on the television monitor as part of the domestic space  it is non-narrative and semi-documentary in style. The film loop represents the mediation of the representation of fear where there is an exclusion of the other from the social body. When considering this installation {{it is important to note}} that politics and art need not be considered as representing two separate and permanent realities. Conversely there is a need to distance politicised art production from any direct political campaign work in so far as the notion of a campaign constitutes a fixed and inflexible space for intellectual and cultural production. Finally this paper expresses the need to maintain a critical openness to media cultures that dominate political discourse. Art practices such as those of Martha Rosler, Haacke and Paul McCarthy are presented as effective strategies for this form of production...|$|E

Obwohl die meisten orientalisierenden Architekten, aufgrund ihrer nur wenigen Gebäude und ihrer geringen Mitwirkung in den Architekturdebatten des 19. Jahrhunderts, weitgehend unbekannt sind, besteht jedoch ein Interesse an ihrer Erforschung, insofern dieses Unternehmen zur Aufklïrung des architektonischen Orientalismus beiträgt. Die Kenntnis der islamischen Architektur, die Quelle ihres Orientalismus, variiert je nach Architekt, denn diese Kenntnis gehört nicht zum traditionellen Ausbildungs- und Wissenskanon der Architekten in Frankreich. Die Reisen in den Orient, die steigende Zahl wissenschaftlicher Monographien, die Beiträge in Fachzeitschriften und vor allem die Weltausstellungen, die Anlass zur Errichtung zahlreicher orientalisierender Pavillons boten, stellen fur die von der École des beaux-arts ausgebildeten Architekten bedeutsame Vermittlungsformen des Orientalismus dar. Vor dem Hintergrund dieser verschiedenen Erfahrungen entstehen Beziehungen zwischen denjenigen Architekten, welche die Erforschung der islamischen Architektur zur Geltung gebracht haben und anderen, fur die der Orientalismus ein Bestandteil des Eklektizismus darstellte. Nur wenigen Architekten gelang es jedoch, beide Haltungen miteinander zu vereinen. Darüber hinaus ähneln sich ihre Laufbahnen in mancher Hinsicht, insbesondere in der Rolle des Staates als wichtigster Bauherr der Weltausstellungen oder als Initiator der politique patrimoniale hinsichtlich der Baudenkmäler in Algérien und in Tunesien, sowie seiner Bedeutung fur die Bauaufträge im Ausland. Zwei Gründe rechtfertigten die Anwendung des orientalisierenden Stils. Auf der einen Seite handelte es sich um die Erneuerung der französischen Architektur durch neue architektonische Vorbilder. Auf der anderen Seite verkorperte der Orientalismus die Sehnsucht der Gesellschaft nach Neuartigem und nach einem « Anderswo » ? Es scheint also deutlich, dass die Heterogenität des Orientalismus diejenige seiner Schöpfer widerspiegelt. Decléty Lorraine. L'architecte orientaliste.

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper will}} show how {{frequency}} diversity improves {{the availability of}} accurate navigation solution of GNSS receivers, {{in the case of}} aeronautical applications for instance. Therefore, frequency diversity is a mean to mitigate jamming and interferences, to consider among others. It is very important for civil aviation to handle a probabilistic theory related to involuntary jamming of GNSS receivers, with and without the use of frequency diversity. As a preliminary hypothesis, we assume that the GNSS link budgets has been equally balanced for each considered band Bi, even if a band is provided with more interferers than an other. In this later case, this would mean that the GNSS power is higher in the band provided with more interferers. This first assumption can be translated in probabilistic terms. The second assumption made is a jamming probability much smaller than 1. These assumptions are used to derive: - The probability to lose the navigation solution of a monosystem dual frequency receiver, like a L 1 /L 5 GPS or GALILEO receiver. - The probability to lose the navigation solution of a monosystem tri-frequency receiver, like a L 1 /L 2 /L 5 GPS receiver or a GALILEO E 5 a/E 5 b/L 1 or E 5 b/E 6 /L 1 receiver. An application is computed, for a jamming probability of 1 / 10000 during a full flight. In such a case, the probability to loose the dual frequency navigation function is 15000 times lower {{in the case of a}} tri-frequency monosystem receiver instead of a dual frequency monosystem receiver, and this makes this event an improbable case. Intermediate conclusions has been drawn : Frequency diversity has an enormous potential as an interference mitigation mean, which can be at least as efficient as beam forming reception GNSS antennas. - To have an efficient ionospheric correction, the availability of two frequencies among a single system is necessary - The use of L 1 C/A, L 2 C, and L 5 is interesting for a more robust GPS receiver. The L 2 C channel can be considered as a backup; L 2 C is the mitigation mean. - The use of E 5 a, E 5 b, and L 1 BOC(1, 1) is also very interesting for an aeronautic GALILEO receiver, since all these 3 bands are ARNS. The E 6 Galileo frequency (provided with integrity) could even be a backup to one E 5 signal <b>componant</b> if necessary. The capabability to process ionospheric corrections using only E 5 a and E 5 b GALILEO signal componants will be discussed, thanks to code/carrier divergence observations. The paper will also show that E 5 b C/No degradation due to military radar spurious is low and acceptable...|$|E
