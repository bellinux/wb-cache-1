25|$|While Chiapas {{is known}} for good coffee, {{there are a number}} of other local beverages. The oldest is pozol, {{originally}} the name for a fermented corn dough. This dough has its origins in the pre Hispanic period. To make the beverage, the dough is dissolved in water and usually flavored with cocoa and sugar, but sometimes it is left to ferment further. It is then served very cold with lots of ice. Taxcalate is a drink made from a powder of toasted corn, achiote, cinnamon and sugar prepared with milk or water. Pumbo is a beverage made with pineapple, <b>club</b> <b>soda,</b> vodka, sugar syrup and lots of ice. Posh is a drink distilled from sugar cane.|$|E

2500|$|Pinker {{asks the}} reader {{to think about the}} words of his Tad and Dixie example and how they resonate. [...] "I did not simply remind you of octopuses; in the {{unlikely}} event that you ever see one develop stripes, you now know what will happen next," [...] he said. [...] "Perhaps the next time you are in a supermarket you will look for <b>club</b> <b>soda,</b> one out of {{the tens of thousands of}} items available, and then not touch it until months later when a particular substance and a particular object accidentally come together. You now share with millions of other people the secrets of protagonists in a world that is the product of some stranger's imagination, the daytime drama All My Children." ...|$|E
2500|$|In New York City in {{the fall}} of 1979, Sun Ra and the Arkestra played as the [...] "house band" [...] at the Squat Theatre on 23rd Street, which was notorious as the {{performance}} venue of the avant-garde Hungarian theater troupe. Janos, their manager, transformed the theater into a nightclub while most of the troupe was away that season performing in Europe. Debbie Harry, [...] "The Velvet Underground"'s John Cale and Nico (from Andy Warhol's Factory days), John Lurie and 'The Lounge Lizards', and other pop and avant-garde musicians were regulars. Sun Ra was disciplined and drank only <b>club</b> <b>soda</b> at the gigs, but did not impose his strict code on his musicians. They respected his discipline and authority. Soft-spoken and charismatic, Sun Ra turned Squat Theater into a universe of big band [...] "space" [...] jazz backed by a floor show of sexy Jupiterettes. He directed while playing three synthesizers at the same time. In those days, [...] "Space Is The Place" [...] was the space at Squat.|$|E

50|$|He {{started his}} career as a DJ and a Producer at an early age of 14, {{although}} his creativity was showing ever since he was a toddler.His first teen project called Ducer was oriented towards experimenting with multiple genres of electronic music such as Electro & Techno. During this time (Age 11-16) he was practicing music production as well as his musical skills, learning different instruments (keyboards, guitar, bass).Further, under the alias of Gliese581, he started a unique project mixing Ambient and Techno. Realizing that Techno had a big {{role in the development of}} this sound, he was making exclusively Futuristic-Tech tunes.Finally, he settled as Jevrem, maturing with his sound and production capability. This alias presents best of both worlds: the underground and commercial aspect of music production, which comes as the most suitable for constant publishing.He was playing at major festivals in Serbia (Exit, Ru:Foam Fest) and <b>clubs</b> (<b>Soda,</b> Kragujevac, Serbia; UMK Club, Kragujevac, Serbia; Brankow, Belgrade, Serbia; Dom Omladine, Belgrade, Serbia; Feedback, Nish, Serbia; Kriterion, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina; Red Carpet, St. Cloud, MN) alone or back to back with his fellow DJ & Producer Caligari.You can find him at the Red Bull Stage in Red Carpet, St. Cloud regularly, where he mixes his all-time favorites with latest modern tunes.|$|R
2500|$|As a demonstration, Pinker {{asks the}} reader to {{surrender}} only his or her imagination to his words for a few moments. He says that he can cause {{the reader to}} think some [...] "very specific thoughts". Pinker gives a few immediate examples; he notes how the [...] "normally grayish body" [...] of a male octopus suddenly becomes striped when selecting a female to mate with, cherries jubilee on a white suit, wine on an altar cloth, and how immediately applying <b>club</b> <b>soda</b> to the white suit or altar cloth works well to remove the stains from the fabrics. In his next mention, Pinker notes a Tad and Dixie scene: [...] "When Dixie {{opens the door to}} Tad, she is stunned, because she thought he was dead," [...] says Pinker. [...] "She slams it in his face and then tries to escape. However, when Tad says, 'I love you,' she lets him in. Tad comforts her, and they become passionate, When Brian interrupts, Dixie tells a stunned Tad that she and Brian were married earlier that day. With much difficulty, Dixie informs Brian that things are nowhere near finished between her and Tad. Then she spills the news that Jamie is Tad's son. 'My what?' says a shocked Tad." ...|$|E
