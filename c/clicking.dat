5|$|Clock Tower is a point-and-click {{adventure}} {{game with}} 3D graphics. The player may use a PlayStation controller or mouse {{to move the}} cursor on the screen. The cursor will change shape when placed over certain objects, which the player can click to interact with. <b>Clicking</b> in any location will guide the player character in that direction. Moving the cursor {{to the top of}} the screen will reveal the player's inventory. <b>Clicking</b> an item and then <b>clicking</b> an object on the screen will use the item on that object or in that location. Some items such as keys are used automatically when clicked.|$|E
5|$|Eland herds are {{accompanied}} by a loud <b>clicking</b> sound that has been subject to considerable speculation. It is believed that {{the weight of the}} animal causes the two halves of its hooves to splay apart, and the <b>clicking</b> {{is the result of the}} hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg. The sound carries some distance from a herd, and may be a form of communication.|$|E

50|$|There {{is a lot}} of {{variability}} in the voicing of <b>clicks,</b> so this distinction may be being lost. The nasal <b>clicks</b> are nasalized prior to the <b>click</b> release and are voiced throughout; the voiceless <b>clicks</b> usually have about 30ms of voice onset time, but sometimes less. There is no voiceless nasal airflow, but following vowels may have a slightly nasalized onset. Thus these <b>clicks</b> are similar to glottalized nasal <b>clicks</b> in other languages. Voiceless <b>clicks</b> are much more common than voiced <b>clicks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dental <b>clicks</b> {{are common}} in Khoisan {{languages}} and the neighboring Nguni languages, such as Zulu and Xhosa. In the Nguni languages, the tenuis <b>click</b> is denoted by the letter c, the murmured <b>click</b> by gc, the aspirated <b>click</b> by ch, and the nasal <b>click</b> by nc. The prenasalized <b>clicks</b> are written ngc and nkc.|$|R
50|$|Below is an {{overview}} of Naro <b>clicks</b> in both orthography and IPA (Visser 2001). The dental <b>click</b> is represented by c. alveolar <b>click</b> by q, palatal <b>click</b> by tc, and lateral <b>click</b> by x. All examples are from Visser (2001).|$|R
5|$|Combat {{occurs in}} real-time, and the player {{character}} may use both melee and ranged weapons. The player attacks by holding the cursor over the game screen and <b>clicking,</b> depressing the button longer to inflict greater damage. Some weapons allow for {{different types of}} attacks depending on where the cursor is held; for example, <b>clicking</b> {{near the bottom of}} the screen may result in a jab, while <b>clicking</b> in the middle produces a slash. Simulated dice rolls occur behind the scenes to determine weapon accuracy. Enemies sometimes try to escape when near death, and the game's stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether. The player may cast spells by selecting an appropriate combination of runestones. Like mantras, runestones must be found in the game world before use. There are over forty spells, some undocumented; their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing the player character to fly.|$|E
5|$|Drowned God uses a point-and-click {{interface}} {{and first}} person perspective typical of games similar to Myst of the mid- to late-1990s. The player navigates and {{interacts with the}} game world by <b>clicking</b> the mouse on {{different parts of the}} screen. The mouse cursor changes shape depending on the action <b>clicking</b> will perform: an arrow for moving to another location, a face with an arrow to pick up or place Tarot cards, and an Eye of Providence for activating or interacting with objects in the environment. Frequent cutscenes provide background information and advance the storyline.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of Him is a first-person narrative-based {{video game}} set around {{the death of}} a {{bisexual}} man named Will. The player controls four characters, each of whom was connected to Will during his lifetime. The characters consist of: Will, who dies in a car crash early in the game; Sarah, Will's ex-girlfriend; Harry, Will's boyfriend {{at the time of his}} death; and Mary, Will's grandmother. The gameplay has the player character walk around the world, with the player triggering snippets of narration by <b>clicking</b> on highlighted objects. When interacting with non-player characters, <b>clicking</b> on them will sometimes result in them disappearing and reappearing in a different location to give the impression of them walking.|$|E
5000|$|Ekoka !Kung has {{a series}} of laminal postalveolar-to-palatal <b>clicks</b> with a noisy, fricated release which derive {{historically}} from more prototypical palatal <b>clicks.</b> These have been variously described as fricated alveolar <b>clicks</b> and (inaccurately) as retroflex <b>clicks.</b> Unlike typical palatal <b>clicks,</b> which have a sharp, abrupt release, these have a slow, turbulent anterior release that sounds much like a short inhaled {{they also have a}} domed tongue rather than a flat tongue like a typical palatal <b>click.</b> said to be lateral Like the <b>clicks</b> they derive from, {{they do not have the}} retracted tongue root and back-vowel constraint typical of alveolar <b>clicks.</b> A provisional transcription for the tenuis <b>click</b> is , though this misleadingly suggests that the <b>clicks</b> are affricates.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} <b>click</b> consonants occur.

5|$|Gameplay in Hatoful Boyfriend {{is similar}} to most other visual novels for the PC, with the {{controls}} limited to the mouse and the only interactions being <b>clicking</b> to forward the game's narrative or to choose between multiple plot choices. The keyboard {{can also be used}} instead of the mouse, with the 'enter' key serving the same purpose as <b>clicking.</b> The save button can be employed at any point during the game, which also features several pages of save slots, allowing gameplay to be easily picked up from prior to a choice the player made. An arrow button in the upper right corner also allows the player to skip dialogue and interactions they have already experienced.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is played}} from an {{isometric}} perspective, and the screen, which {{does not need to}} remain centered on the protagonist, can be scrolled with the mouse or the keyboard. Areas are revealed as they are explored by the player's characters. A fog of war effect hides explored areas when the player's characters move away from them. The player can also change the formation in which the party moves. <b>Clicking</b> an area exit, such as a doorway or staircase, causes another area to be loaded. <b>Clicking</b> on the edge of an outside area causes the party to travel there; the game then presents the player with the World Map, from which the player may select a destination.|$|E

50|$|CPC: Cost per <b>click</b> {{tracks the}} cost of {{interacting}} with a client or potential client. In traditional marketing, CPC {{is viewed as a}} one-way process of reaching target audiences through means such as direct mail, radio ads and television ads. Search advertising provides opportunities for two-way contacts through web-based chat, Internet-based calls, call-back requests or mailing list sign-ups. There are some guidelines to establish minimum acceptable counting procedure for <b>clicks.</b> Each and every <b>click</b> has a life cycle which is known as <b>click</b> referral cycle. It comprises four stages: Initiated <b>click,</b> Measured <b>click,</b> Received <b>click</b> and Resolved <b>click.</b>|$|R
5|$|The player {{interacts with}} {{characters}} and objects by <b>clicking</b> on them. <b>Clicking</b> {{on the ground}} causes the player's selected characters to move. The gameplay, though in real-time, can be paused, whereupon commands may be issued to controllable characters, who will attempt to execute them when the game is unpaused. The game can also be set to pause automatically at certain times. Dialogue is started by NPCs at certain scripted times, or by the player's <b>clicking</b> on NPCs who are not immediately hostile. When speaking to an NPC, the player must often choose what to say {{from a list of}} responses. The dialogue may lead to quests or important information. When the player clicks on a hostile being, the currently selected characters will advance to attack it. Information about characters, creatures, items, and buildings in the game environment is shown on a tool tip, which appears when the mouse pointer is held over game elements.|$|E

5|$|Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption—shortened to Redemption—is a {{role-playing}} game (RPG) presented {{primarily from}} the third-person perspective; the playable character is shown on the screen while an optional first-person mode used to view the character's immediate environment is available. The camera can be freely rotated around the character and positioned above it to give a greater overview of the immediate area. The game follows a linear, mission-based structure. Interaction is achieved by using a mouse to click on an enemy or environmental object to attack it or to activate it. Interaction is context based; <b>clicking</b> on an enemy initiates combat, while <b>clicking</b> on a door causes it to open or close.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are deep-diving predators {{foraging}} in meso- and bathypelagic ecosystems off {{the continental}} shelves. To investigate the ecophysiological and communicative function of various <b>click</b> types from male sperm whales in a high-latitude habitat, we deployed a large-aperture array of calibrated hydrophones off northern Norway (N 69, E 15). Data show that sperm whales in this habitat produce three <b>click</b> types: usual <b>clicks,</b> creak <b>clicks</b> and, occasionally, slow <b>clicks.</b> Usual <b>clicks</b> and creak <b>clicks</b> exhibit short duration, profound directionality and a frequency content suited for echolocation on meso- and bathypelagic fish and squids. The acoustic properties and low repetition rate of usual <b>clicks</b> are suited for long-range echoloca-tion, whereas creak <b>clicks</b> have properties equivalent to signals in buzzes, the terminating pulse trains known from echolocating bats during prey capture. From these source parameters {{and the high}} acoustic activity during foraging dives, it is concluded that echolocation is an important sensory cue in prey location. Sound pressure levels of creak <b>clicks</b> and usual <b>clicks</b> measured off the acoustic axis suggest that sperm whales may be subject-ed to eavesdropping by conspecifics, thereby conveying information about food aggregations at estimated ranges of 6 km for creak <b>clicks</b> and 16 km for usual <b>clicks.</b> Slow <b>clicks</b> exhibit low directionality, low-frequency emphasis and a reduced repetition rate, suggesting that this <b>click</b> type is more suited for communication than for echolo-cation. Slow <b>clicks</b> can be detected by submerged con-specifics at ranges up to 60 km. Thus, sperm whales pro-ducing slow <b>clicks</b> may represent an odontocete species that utilizes long-range sound communication...|$|R
5|$|Atop the whale's skull is {{positioned}} a large complex of organs {{filled with a}} liquid mixture of fats and waxes called spermaceti. The purpose of this complex is to generate powerful and focused <b>clicking</b> sounds, which the sperm whale uses for echolocation and communication.|$|E
5|$|If the plantar fascia {{continues}} to be overused {{in the setting of}} plantar fasciitis, the plantar fascia can rupture. Typical signs and symptoms of plantar fascia rupture include a <b>clicking</b> or snapping sound, significant local swelling, and acute pain in the sole of the foot.|$|E
5|$|Like {{a typical}} mobile ransomware, it employs scare tactics to extort {{people to pay}} a ransom. The program pretends to be an accusatory authority, {{demanding}} the victim to pay a fine from $100 to $200 USD or otherwise face a fictitious charge. Rather surprisingly, Fusob suggests using iTunes gift cards for payment. Also, a timer <b>clicking</b> down on the screen adds to the users’ anxiety as well.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in <b>click</b> model have established {{it as an}} attractive approach to infer document relevance. Most of these advances consider the user click/skip behavior as binary events but neglect {{the context in which}} a <b>click</b> happens. We show that real <b>click</b> behavior in industrial search engines is often noisy and not always a good indication of relevance. For a considerable percentage of <b>clicks,</b> users select what turn out to be irrelevant documents and these <b>clicks</b> should not be directly used as evidence for relevance inference. Thus in this paper, we put forward an observation that the relevance indication degree of a <b>click</b> is not a constant, but can be differentiated by user preferences and {{the context in which the}} user makes her <b>click</b> decision. In particular, to interpret the <b>click</b> behavior discriminatingly, we propose a Noise-aware <b>Click</b> Model (NCM) by characterizing the noise degree of a <b>click,</b> which indicates the quality of the <b>click</b> for inferring relevance. Specifically, the lower the <b>click</b> noise is, the more important the <b>click</b> is in its role for relevance inference. To verify the necessity of explicitly accounting for the uninformative noise in a user <b>click,</b> we conducted experiments on a billion-scale dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that as compared with two state-of-theart <b>click</b> models in Web Search, NCM can better interpret user <b>click</b> behavior and achieve significant improvements in terms of both perplexity and NDCG...|$|R
5000|$|With the voiceless {{aspirated}} <b>clicks,</b> voicing starts partway {{through the}} aspiration, , so the voice-onset {{time is not}} as long as that of the glottalized <b>clicks.</b> With the voiced aspirated <b>clicks,</b> the aspiration is generally voiced throughout, but voicing decreases during the hold of the <b>click,</b> and the release itself is voiceless, unlike the release of modally voiced <b>clicks.</b> (That is, these are better described as pre-voiced aspirated <b>clicks.)</b> For the <b>clicks</b> with delayed aspiration, the aspiration is quite long, starting out weak and increasing in intensity with time (unlike the aspiration of the simple aspirated <b>clicks,</b> which starts out strong and decreases in intensity). When the <b>click</b> is in utterance-initial position, there is no voicing in the hold or in the aspiration. However, when the <b>click</b> occurs after a vowel, it is nasal throughout the hold, ending just before the release, but with voicing continuing though the release and throughout the aspiration: [...] vs [...] The preglottalized <b>clicks</b> have a much shorter voice lead (negative VOT) than the plain nasal <b>clicks,</b> sometimes hardly audible.|$|R
30|$|A paired {{stimulation}} paradigm {{was used}} to assess P 50 m sensory gating. A <b>click</b> 1  ms in duration and 80  dB in sound pressure was used. The click-click interval was 500  ms. The trial-trial interval was 8 [*]~[*] 12  s. Epochs of 150 <b>click</b> pairs were averaged. Similar to the above procedures, a two-dipole model was obtained using the waveform evoked by the first <b>click</b> (<b>Click</b> 1). Source strength waveforms were obtained by applying the model to both the waveform for <b>Click</b> 1 and <b>Click</b> 2, and the peak latency and amplitude were measured. The amplitude was measured from the baseline. Percentage inhibition of P 50 m (P 50 m%inhibition) was defined as (<b>Click</b> 1 response – <b>Click</b> 2 response) / <b>Click</b> 1 response * 100.|$|R

5|$|All {{functions}} can {{be invoked}} by the mouse. Keys can also invoke the game setup, {{some of the}} menu options and some gameplay functions including scrolling and pausing the game. Players can select single units by <b>clicking,</b> and groups of up to four by shift-clicking or bandboxing. To move units, players can shift the mouse to select units on the main map, move to the unit menu to select an action, {{and then back to}} the main map or minimap to specify the target area; but shortcut keys can eliminate the middle mouse action in this cycle.|$|E
50|$|As {{do other}} consonants, <b>clicks</b> vary in phonation. Oral <b>clicks</b> are attested with four phonations: tenuis, {{aspirated}}, voiced and breathy voiced (murmured). Nasal <b>clicks</b> may also vary, with plain voiced, breathy voiced / murmured nasal, aspirated and unaspirated voiceless <b>clicks</b> attested (the last only in Taa). The aspirated nasal <b>clicks</b> are often {{said to have}} 'delayed aspiration'; there is nasal airflow throughout the <b>click,</b> which may become voiced between vowels, though the aspiration itself is voiceless. A few languages also have pre-glottalised nasal <b>clicks,</b> which have very brief prenasalisation but have not been phonetically analysed {{to the extent that}} other types of <b>clicks</b> have.|$|R
