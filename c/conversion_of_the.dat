5|$|From {{the middle}} of the 16th century the Dominican Order had been tasked with the {{peaceful}} <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ch'ol of Verapaz and southern Petén, and their concentration into new colonial towns. The Itza became fearful that the newly converted Manche Ch'ol would lead the Spanish to Nojpetén. In 1628 the towns of the Manche Ch'ol were placed under the administration of the governor of Verapaz, with Dominican friar Francisco Morán as their ecclesiastical head. Morán favoured a more robust approach to the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Manche and moved Spanish soldiers into the region to protect against raids from the Itza to the north. The new Spanish garrison in an area that had not previously seen a heavy Spanish military presence provoked the Manche to revolt, which was followed by abandonment of the indigenous settlements. The Itza, worried about the southern approaches to their territory, may have instigated a Manche rebellion that took place in Lent 1633.|$|E

5|$|In 1613, John Sigismund {{converted}} from Lutheranism to Calvinism, {{but failed to}} achieve the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estates by the rule of cuius regio, eius religio. Thus, on 5 February 1615, he granted the Lutherans religious freedom, while the electors court remained largely Calvinist. When Frederick William I rebuilt Brandenburg-Prussia's war-torn economy, he attracted settlers from all Europe, especially by offering religious asylum, most prominently by the Edict of Potsdam which attracted more than 15,000 Huguenots.|$|E
5|$|Marwan's 737 {{expedition}} was {{the climax}} of the Arab–Khazar wars, but its actual results were meagre. Although the Arab campaigns after Ardabil may indeed have discouraged the Khazars from further warfare, any recognition of Islam or of Arab supremacy by the khagan was evidently conditional upon the presence of Arab troops deep in Khazar territory, and such presence could not be sustained for long. Furthermore, the credibility of the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> khagan to Islam is disputed: al-Baladhuri's account, which probably reflects closer the original sources, suggests that it was not the khagan but a minor lord who converted to Islam and was placed in charge of the Khazars at al-Lakz. The <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> khagan is also apparently contradicted by the fact that c. 740 the Khazar court embraced Judaism as its official faith, a decision which clearly owed a great deal to the determination of the Khazars to avoid assimilation by and emphasize their independence from the Christian Byzantine and the Muslim Arab empires.|$|E

5|$|Serial {{production}} {{started in}} 1964, with the bodies built at Strømmens Værksted, the motors built by NEBB and the electrical equipment by AEG. By 1978, 162 cars had been delivered to Oslo Sporveier. These were manufactured in four series, named T1 through T4, with varying specifications. T1 was manufactured in 90 units from 1964 to 1966 {{for the opening}} of the Grorud Line and the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lambertseter Line. The first 30 have driver's cabs in both directions (designated T1-2), while the latter 60 have it in only one end (designated T1-1). In 1967, 15 T2s were built for the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Østensjø Line. Although given a new designation, they are in all ways identical to the T1-1s. From 1969 to 1972, 30 T3s were built for the Furuset Line. Further expansions of the lines resulted in 37 T4s being built from 1976 to 1978. The T1000s are numbered 1001–1162.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{transfer}} of Eurostar services from Waterloo, the former Eurostar platforms 20–24 of Waterloo International have remained unused.

In December 2008 preparatory work was carried out to enable platform 20 to be used by South West Trains suburban services. However, the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining platforms was delayed as it would require alterations to the track layout outside the station.|$|E
