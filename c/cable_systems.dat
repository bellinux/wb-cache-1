5|$|In 1992, Congress passed must-carry regulations, which {{required}} cable carriers to allocate spectrum to local broadcasters. This affected {{the availability of}} C-SPAN in some areas, in particular C-SPAN2, as some providers chose to discontinue carriage of the channel altogether. Between 1993 and 1994, <b>cable</b> <b>systems</b> in 95 U.S. cities dropped or reduced broadcasts of C-SPAN and C-SPAN2, following {{the implementation of the}} must-carry regulations. Viewers protested these decisions, especially when the changes coincided with matters of local interest occurring in the House or Senate. Some communities, such as Eugene, Oregon and Alexandria, Virginia, were successful in restoring C-SPAN availability. C-SPAN availability was later restored as technological developments that resulted in the expansion of channel capacity on cable providers allowed for mandatory stations and the C-SPAN networks both to be broadcast.|$|E

50|$|The network number allows {{to address}} (and {{communicate}} with) the IPX nodes {{which do not}} belong to the same network or <b>cabling</b> <b>system.</b> The <b>cabling</b> <b>system</b> is a network in which a data link layer protocol can be used for communication.

Using different frame formats in one <b>cabling</b> <b>system</b> is possible, but it works similarly as if separate <b>cabling</b> <b>systems</b> were used (i.e. different network numbers must be used for different frame formats even in the same <b>cabling</b> <b>system</b> and a router must be to allow communication between nodes using different frame formats in the same <b>cabling</b> <b>system).</b>|$|R
