The moist and warm region consisted of ferns, such as Cynepteris, Phelopteris and Clathropteris, gymnosperms, represented by Pelourdea, Araucarioxylon, Woodworthia, Otozamites and Dinophyton, and cycads like Sanmiguelia. Plants of the Dockum Group are not well known since the oxidizing of the environment has destroyed most of the plant fossils. However, {{some of them may}} provide information about the climate in Dockum Group during the late Triassic period. For example, the discovery of large specimens belonging to Araucarioxylon determine that the region was well watered. The fauna found in Dockum Group confirm that there were lakes and/or rivers containing fish such as the cartilaginous Xenacanthus, the lobe-finned Chinlea and the dipnoan <b>Ceratodus.</b> On the shores of these rivers lived labyrinthodonts (Latiscopus) and reptiles such as Malerisaurus and Trilophosaurus. Also living on the margins of the lakes were the archosaurs Leptosuchus, Nicrosaurus and Rutiodon. Postosuchus lived in the uplands along with Coelophysis and other archosaurs such as Desmatosuchus and Typothorax. Postosuchus was one of the largest animals in that ecosystem and preyed on herbivores such as Trilophosaurus and Typothorax.|$|E

[Footnote 7: Since this Address was read, Mr. Krefft {{has sent}} us {{news of the}} {{discovery}} in Australia of a freshwater fish of strangely Palaeozoic aspect, and apparently a Ganoid intermediate between Dipterus and Lepidosiren.

60|$|The lowest {{forms of}} {{vertebrates}} are the fishes, and these appear {{first in the}} geological record in the Upper Silurian formation. The most ancient known fish is a Pteraspis, one of the bucklered ganoids or plated fishes--by no means a very low type--allied to the sturgeon (Accipenser) and alligator-gar (Lepidosteus), but, as a group, now nearly extinct. Almost equally ancient are the sharks, which under various forms still abound in our seas. We cannot suppose these to be nearly the earliest fishes, especially as the two lowest orders, now represented by the Amphioxus or lancelet and the lampreys, {{have not yet been}} found fossil. The ganoids were greatly developed in the Devonian era, and continued till the Cretaceous, when they gave way to the true osseous fishes, which had first appeared in the Jurassic period, and have continued to increase till the present day. This much later appearance of the higher osseous fishes is quite in accordance with evolution, although some of the very lowest forms, the lancelet and the lampreys, together with the archaic <b>ceratodus,</b> have survived to our time.|$|E
6000|$|The Silurian rocks, {{lower and}} upper, which in these islands have their chief {{development}} in Wales, {{and which are}} nearly thirty-eight thousand feet thick; and the Devonian or Old Red sandstone beds, which in the Fans of Brecon and Carmarthenshire attain a thickness of ten thousand feet, must be passed through in an upward direction before we reach {{the bottom of that}} Carboniferous Limestone of which I spoke in my last paper. We thus find on the Cambrian rocks forty- five thousand feet at least of newer rocks, in several cases lying unconformably on each other, showing thereby that the lower beds had been upheaved, and their edges worn off on a sea-shore, ere the upper were laid down on them; and throughout this vast thickness of rocks, the remains of hundreds of forms of animals, corals, shells, fish, older forms dying out in the newer rocks, and new ones taking their places in a steady succession of ever-varying forms, till those in the upper beds have become unlike those in the lower, and all are from the beginning more or less unlike any existing now on earth. [...] Whole families, indeed, disappear entirely, like the Trilobites, which seem to have swarmed in the Silurian seas, holding the same place there as crabs and shrimps do in our modern seas. They vanish after the period of the coal, and their place is taken by an allied family of Crustaceans, of which only one form (as far as I am aware) lingers now on earth, namely, the [...] "King Crab," [...] or Limulus, of the Indian Seas, a well-known animal, of which specimens may sometimes be seen alive in English aquaria. So perished in the lapse of those same ages, the armour-plated or [...] "Ganoid" [...] fish which Hugh Miller made so justly famous--and which made him so justly famous in return-- appearing first in the upper Silurian beds, and abounding in vast variety of strange forms in the old Red Sandstone, but gradually disappearing from the waters of the world, till their only representatives, as far as known, are the Lepidostei, or [...] "Bony Pikes," [...] of North America; the Polypteri of the Nile and Senegal; the Lepidosirens of the African lakes and Western rivers; the <b>Ceratodus</b> or Barramundi of Queensland (the two latter of which approach Amphibians), and one or two more fantastic forms, either rudimentary or degraded, which have lasted on here and there in isolated stations through long ages, comparatively unchanged while all the world is changed around them, and their own kindred, buried like the fossil <b>Ceratodus</b> of the Trias beneath thousands of feet of ancient rock, among creatures the likes whereof are not to be found now on earth. [...] And these are but two examples out of hundreds of the vast changes which have taken place in the animal life of the globe, between the laying down of the Cambrian slates and the present time.|$|E
60|$|In {{the oldest}} {{secondary}} rocks of Britain and elsewhere there occur in abundance {{the teeth of}} a genus of ganoid fishes known as the Ceratodi. (I apologise for ganoid, {{though it is not}} a swear-word). These teeth reappear {{from time to time in}} several subsequent formations, but at last slowly die out altogether; and of course all naturalists naturally concluded that the creature to which they belonged had died out also, and was long since numbered with the dodo and the mastodon. The idea that a <b>Ceratodus</b> could still be living, far less that it formed an important link in the development of all the higher animals, could never for a moment have occurred to anybody. As well expect to find a palæolithic man quietly chipping flints on a Pacific atoll, or to discover the ancestor of all horses on the isolated and crag-encircled summit of Roraima, as to unearth a real live <b>Ceratodus</b> from a modern estuary. In 1870, however, Mr. Krefft took away the breath of scientific Europe by informing it that he had found the extinct ganoid swimming about as large as life, and six feet long, without the faintest consciousness of its own scientific importance, in a river in Queensland at the present day. The unsophisticated aborigines knew it as barramunda; the almost equally ignorant white settlers called it with irreverent and unfilial contempt the flat-head. On further examination, however, the despised barramunda proved to be a connecting link of primary rank between the oldest surviving group of fishes and the lowest air-breathing animals like the frogs and salamanders. Though a true fish, it leaves its native streams at night, and sets out on a foraging expedition after vegetable food in the neighbouring woodlands. There it browses on myrtle leaves and grasses, and otherwise behaves itself in a manner wholly unbecoming its piscine antecedents and aquatic education. To fit it for this strange amphibious life, the barramunda has both lungs and gills; it can breathe either air or water at will, or, if it chooses, the two together. Though covered with scales, and most fish-like in outline, it presents points of anatomical resemblance both to salamanders and lizards; and, as a connecting bond between the North American mud-fish on the one hand and the wonderful lepidosiren on the other, it forms a true member of the long series by which the higher animals generally trace their descent from a remote race of marine ancestors. It is very interesting, therefore, to find that this living fossil link between fish and reptiles should have survived only in the fossil continent, Australia. Everywhere else it has long since been beaten out of the field by its own more developed amphibian descendants; in Australia alone it still drags on a lonely existence as the last relic of an otherwise long-forgotten and extinct family.|$|E
60|$|An adult toad buries {{himself in}} the mud by a dry pond, and gets coated with a hard solid coat of sun-baked clay. His nodule is broken open with a spade, and the toad himself is found inside, almost exactly filling the space within the cavity. He has only {{been there for a}} few months at the outside; but the clay is as hard as a stone, and to the bucolic mind looks as if it might have been there ever since the Deluge. Good blue lias clay, which dries as solid as limestone, would perform this trick to perfection; and the toad might easily be relegated {{accordingly}} to the secondary ages of geology. Observe, however, that the actual toads so found are not the geological toads we should naturally expect under such remarkable circumstances, but the common everyday toads of modern England. This shows a want of accurate scientific knowledge {{on the part of the}} toads which is truly lamentable. A toad who really wished to qualify himself for the post ought at least to avoid presenting himself before a critical eye in the foolish guise of an embodied anachronism. He reminds one of the Roman mother in a popular burlesque, who suspects her son of smoking, and vehemently declares that she smells tobacco, but, after a moment, recollects the historical proprieties, and mutters to herself, apologetically, 'No, not tobacco; that's not yet invented.' A would-be silurian or triassic toad ought, in like manner, to remember that in the ages to whose honours he aspires his own amphibian kind was not yet developed. He ought rather to come out in the character of a <b>ceratodus</b> or a labyrinthodon.|$|E
60|$|In {{the above}} work (vol. ii. p. 12), I also attributed, though with much hesitation, the {{frequent}} cases of polydactylism {{in men and}} various animals to reversion. I was partly led to this through Prof. Owen's statement, {{that some of the}} Ichthyopterygia possess more than five digits, and therefore, as I supposed, had retained a primordial condition; but Prof. Gegenbaur ('Jenaischen Zeitschrift,' B. v. Heft 3, s. 341), disputes Owen's conclusion. On the other hand, according to the opinion lately advanced by Dr. Gunther, on the paddle of <b>Ceratodus,</b> which is provided with articulated bony rays on both sides of a central chain of bones, there seems no great difficulty in admitting that six or more digits on one side, or on both sides, might reappear through reversion. I am informed by Dr. Zouteveen that there is a case on record of a man having twenty-four fingers and twenty-four toes! I was chiefly led {{to the conclusion that the}} presence of supernumerary digits might be due to reversion from the fact that such digits, not only are strongly inherited, but, as I then believed, had the power of regrowth after amputation, like the normal digits of the lower vertebrata. But I have explained in the second edition of my Variation under Domestication why I now place little reliance on the recorded cases of such regrowth. Nevertheless it deserves notice, inasmuch as arrested development and reversion are intimately related processes; that various structures in an embryonic or arrested condition, such as a cleft palate, bifid uterus, etc., are frequently accompanied by polydactylism. This has been strongly insisted on by Meckel and Isidore Geoffroy St.-Hilaire. But at present it is the safest course to give up altogether the idea that there is any relation between the development of supernumerary digits and reversion to some lowly organised progenitor of man.) There are other cases which come more strictly under our present head of reversion. Certain structures, regularly occurring in the lower members of the group to which man belongs, occasionally make their appearance in him, though not found in the normal human embryo; or, if normally present in the human embryo, they become abnormally developed, although in a manner which is normal in the lower members of the group. These remarks will be rendered clearer by the following illustrations.|$|E
60|$|The {{serpentine}} Amphibia {{are represented}} by two species of Cæcilia. These creatures externally resemble large worms, except {{that they have a}} true head with jaws and rudimentary eyes, while internally they have of course a true vertebrate skeleton. They live underground, burrowing by means of the ring-like folds of the skin which simulate the jointed segments of a worm's body, and when caught they exude a viscid slime. The young have external gills which are afterwards replaced by true lungs, and this peculiar metamorphosis shows that they belong to the amphibia rather than to the reptiles. The Cæcilias are widely but very sparingly distributed through all the tropical regions; a fact which may, as we have seen, be taken as an indication of the great antiquity of the group, and that it is now verging towards extinction. In the Seychelles Islands there appear to be three species of these singular animals. Cryptopsophis multiplicatus is confined to the islands; Herpele squalostoma is found also in Western India and in Africa; while Hypogeophis rostratus inhabits both West Africa and South America.[107] This last is certainly {{one of the most remarkable}} cases of the wide and discontinuous distribution of a species; and {433} when we consider the habits of life of these animals and the extreme slowness with which it is likely they can migrate into new areas, we can hardly arrive at any other conclusion than that this species once had an almost world-wide range, and that in the process of dying out it has been left stranded, as it were, in these three remote portions of the globe. The extreme stability and long persistence of specific form which this implies is extraordinary, but not unprecedented, among the lower vertebrates. The crocodiles of the Eocene period differ but slightly from those of the present day, while a small freshwater turtle from the Pliocene deposits of the Siwalik Hills is absolutely identical with a still living Indian species, Emys tectus. The mud-fish of Australia, <b>Ceratodus</b> forsteri is a very ancient type, and may well have remained specifically unchanged since early Tertiary times. It is not, therefore, incredible that this Seychelles Cæcilia may be the oldest land vertebrate now living on the globe; dating back to the early part of the Tertiary period, when the warm climate of the northern hemisphere in high latitudes and the union of the Asiatic and American continents allowed of the migration of such types over the whole northern hemisphere, from which they subsequently passed into the southern hemisphere, maintaining themselves only in certain limited areas, where the physical conditions were especially favourable, or where they were saved from the attacks of enemies or the competition of higher forms.|$|E

50|$|Archipterygium (or ancient fin) is {{the concept}} of a {{primitive}} limb from which the limbs of tetrapod animals evolved.

Gegenbaur based this idea on the fin of <b>Ceratodus</b> and its similarity to the gill-region in Elasmobranchs.

A The <b>Ceratodus</b> Rest Area {{is important in}} demonstrating {{the pattern of the}} region’s history, by providing tangible and intangible evidence of two key historical processes that were significant in the region, namely the use of Native Police and the construction of the railway in the early twentieth century. The site is also important in demonstrating the emergence of community interest {{in the history of the}} locality, illustrated by the erection of the cairn to the Native Police and the relocation of the former <b>Ceratodus</b> Railway Station building and its ongoing maintenance. Statement The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in the region’s history. H The <b>Ceratodus</b> Rest Area has a special association with two community groups, the Eidsvold and District Historical Society and the <b>Ceratodus</b> Relocation Committee, both of which were (and in the case of the historical society, remain) important community organisations committed to preserving and communicating the history of the region...|$|E
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} reconstructions of the dermal skulls of <b>Ceratodus</b> sturii, Ptychoceratodus serratus, Asiatoceratodus (Arganodus) atlantis, and Mioceratodus gregoryi are described, {{and compared}} with adult skulls of Recent lungfish {{of the genera}} Neoceratodus and Protopterus. Inferred patterns of fusion and reduction of the skull bones of Neoceratodus, Mioceratodus, and Protopterus suggest that these form one natural lineage, excluding <b>Ceratodus,</b> Ptychoceratodus, and Asiatoceratodus. The study of skull roofing bones also indicates that Asiatoceratodus atlantis and Ptychoceratodus serratus are {{related to each other}} but not close to other Mesozoic and Cenozoic lungfish, and that <b>Ceratodus</b> sturii is a distinct taxon more distantly associated with other derived dipnoans. The dentitions of the different genera provide unifying characters as all are based on initially isolated cusps that fuse in a pattern of radiating ridges to form tooth plates...|$|E
40|$|A {{small but}} diverse osteichthyan {{assemblage}} from the freshwater deposits of the Early Triassic Knocklofty Formation of southeastern Tasmania is described. This includes <b>Ceratodus</b> gypsatus, Quenstedt, a coelacanthid, Acrolepis hamiltoni Johnston and Morton, Acrolepis tasmanicus Johnston and Morton, Cleithrolepis granulata Egerton, Saurichthys sp. of which only the Acrolepis spp. {{had been previously}} recorded from this area, and an undetermined coulacante. Previously only had been reported from this locality...|$|E
40|$|The Albian-Cenomanian Alcântara Formation {{of northeastern}} Brazil {{preserves}} {{the most diverse}} continental vertebrate fauna of this age yet known from northern South America. The Alcântara vertebrate assemblage, consisting of elasmobranchs, actinopterygians, sarcopterygians, turtles, crocodyliforms, pterosaurs, and non-avian dinosaurs, displays close similarities to contemporaneous faunas from North Africa. The co-occurrence {{of as many as}} eight freshwater or estuarine fish taxa (Onchopristis, Bartschichthys, Lepidotes, Stephanodus, Mawsonia, Arganodus, <b>Ceratodus</b> africanus, and possibly <b>Ceratodus</b> humei) and up to seven terrestrial archosaur taxa (Sigilmassasaurus, Rebbachisauridae, Baryonychinae, Spinosaurinae, Carcharodontosauridae, possibly Pholidosauridae, and doubtfully Bahariasaurus) suggests that a land route connecting northeastern Brazil and North Africa existed at least until the Albian. Interestingly, most components of this mid-Cretaceous northern South American/North African assemblage are not shared with coeval southern South American faunas, which are themselves characterized by a number of distinct freshwater and terrestrial vertebrate taxa (e. g., chelid turtles, megaraptoran and unenlagiine theropods). These results suggest that, although mid-Cretaceous faunal interchange was probably possible between northern South America and North Africa, paleogeographic, paleoclimatic, and/or paleoenvironmental barriers may have hindered continental vertebrate dispersal between northern and southern South America during this time. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|A genus {{and species}} of dipnoan, {{originally}} described as Proceratodus carlinvillensis by Romer and Smith (1934), from Pennsylvanian deposits in Illinois, is assigned to the genus Sagenodus. It is identical in characters reliable at the generic level to the type species of Sagenodus, and differs significantly from species of the related genera Ctenodus and Tranodis. Romer and Smith’s specimen is quite unlike any species of the genus <b>Ceratodus</b> or Neoceratodus and cannot {{be regarded as a}} primitive ceratodont. The specimen is also affected by a developmental abnormality called short ridge anomaly. Incidences of this aberration are widespread among dipnoan species, but have no diagnostic importance at the specific and generic level...|$|E
