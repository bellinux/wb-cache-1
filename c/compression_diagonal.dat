In this thesis the seismic behaviors of the hinged steel structure, a typical structure of historical buildings, i. e. hinged steel frames in Shanghai, China, were studied based on experimental investigations and theoretic analysis. How the non-structural members worked with the steel frames was analyzed thoroughly. Firstly, two 1 / 4 scale hinged steel frames were constructed based on the structural system of Bund 18, a historical building in Shanghai: M 1 model without infill walls, M 2 model with infill walls, and tested under the horizontal cyclic loads to investigate their seismic behavior. The Shaking Table Test and its results indicated that the seismic behavior of the hinged steel frames could be improved significantly with the help of non-structural members, i. e., surrounding elements outside the hinged steel frames and infilled walls. To specify, the columns are covered with bricks, they consist of I shape formed steel sections and steel plates, which are clenched together. The steel beams are connected to the steel column by steel angle, thus the structure should be considered as a hinged frame. And the infilled wall acted as a <b>compression</b> <b>diagonal</b> strut to withstand the horizontal load, therefore, the seismic capacity and stiffness of the hinged steel frames with infilled walls could be estimated by using the equivalent <b>compression</b> <b>diagonal</b> strut model. A SAP model has been constructed with the objective to perform a dynamic nonlinear analysis. The obtained results were compared with the results obtained from Shaking Table Test.

An analytical model was developed and published for predicting the relative flexural capacity of steel fibre high strength concrete beams (M-u/M-fl) i. e. the ratio of moment with shear interaction to pure flexural moment, This paper investigates the significant role of steel fibres in increasing the beam strength up to its full flexural capacity.

40|$|Chevron {{concentric}} bracings (CCBs) {{are widely}} used {{in the design of}} seismic resistant multistorey steel building owing to both the high structural efficiency and the architectural functionality, thus allowing the placement of doorways, windows and plants. The seismic performance of CCBs is strongly related to the behaviour of the beam of the braced span [1 - 3]. It is well known that the buckling of the brace in compression results in a vertical force applied on the beam in the braced bay. Depending on the strength of the beam, two main collapse mechanisms can be achieved as follows: 1. weak beam mechanism: the beam experiences in plastic bending deformations. 2. strong beam mechanism: the beam is sufficiently strong to resist elastically the unbalance force due to brace buckling, thus allowing the yielding of the brace in tension. The first collapse mechanism should be avoided, because it leads to a poor dissipative behaviour with a significant deterioration of overall force-displacement curve. Therefore, this kind of collapse mechanism is characterized by ductility and energy dissipation demand larger than those experienced in case of strong beam mechanism. [4, 5]. The current seismic codes (e. g. EN 1998 - 1 [6], AISC 341 [7]) provide capacity design criteria to achieve strong beam mechanism. In particular, according to EN 1998 - 1 [6] the beams of the braced spans should be designed to resist the following conditions: - all non-seismic actions without considering the intermediate support given by the diagonals; - the unbalanced vertical seismic action effect applied to the beam by the braces after buckling of the <b>compression</b> <b>diagonal.</b> This vertical force should be calculated using Npl,Rd for the brace in tension and γpbNpl,Rd for the brace in compression, being the factor γpb used for the estimation of the post buckling resistance of diagonals in compression (generally assumed equal to 0. 3) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{in-plane}} {{stiffness of}} glass panes {{can be used}} to stiffen a glass façade. These structures have to fulfil two main criteria: firstly, an allowable stress distribution for safety and secondly, a maximum horizontal displacement for serviceability. To realize a stabilising façade, the framework and glass panes have to be structurally bonded. A proper technique is a circumferentially glued joint. Three joint types and two adhesives are investigated. Joint type 1 is a polyurethane joint on end. Joint type 2 is a two-sided epoxy joint and joint type 3 is a one-sided epoxy joint. The square annealed single glass pane and a joint type are placed in a frame which is horizontally loaded at the right top corner (deformation controlled). The load-displacement relation of a system with joint type 1 is bi-linear. The first part has a low stiffness without cracking, because the pane shifts and rotates within the flexible joint. The second part has a large stiffness, because the displaced pane is activated mechanically accompanying with cracking at the corners of the compression strut. The compression strut transfers the load for both parts. The warning mechanism’ for failure is good. The load-displacement relation of systems with joint type 2 shows a gradually decreasing curve accompanying with cracking. The stiffness is clearly larger than systems with joint type 1. The compression stresses are large in the <b>compression</b> <b>diagonal</b> at maximum load. The ‘warning mechanism’ for failure is good. The load-displacement relation of systems with joint type 3 also shows a slightly decreasing curve accompanying with cracking.

40|$|Steel frames with {{reinforced}} concrete infill walls (SRCWs) are earthquake-resistant hybrid systems classified as Type 1 in EN 1998 - 1 [1] {{where they are}} considered to behave essentially as {{reinforced concrete}} walls able of dissipating energy in the vertical steel sections and in the vertical reinforcements of the walls. In addition, detailing provisions are the same provided for reinforced concrete walls except for indications on the edge shear connections. In reality, their behaviour might be very different and characterised by a resisting system in which diagonal compression struts develop within the reinforced concrete infill walls, resulting in cracks in the tension diagonal and crushing in the <b>compression</b> <b>diagonal.</b> Such issues are strictly related {{to the lack of}} a specific capacity design procedure that allows controlling the formation of a proper dissipating mechanism. Refined analyses previously carried out on SRCW systems [2] designed according to Eurocodes demonstrated an unsatisfactory fragile behaviour due to the severe damage occuring to concrete long before yielding of the ductile elements. The failure mechanism is generally characterised by yielding of the steel frame concentrated mainly in the elements {{near the bottom of the}} wall (more specifically at the connections of the horizontal to the vertical parts). The plastic deformation on the concrete infill walls concentrates in a diagonal path clearly indicating the distribution of cracking. In addition, localized plastic deformations are also present near the corners of the infill walls due to the local action of the first studs of the horizontal and vertical elements (Figure 1 a). The innovative system depicted in Figure 1 b is proposed to overcome the previous critical aspects. The RC infill walls are not connected to the vertical columns where the energy dissipation is expected. The system is conceived to control the formation of diagonal struts in the infill walls and behaves as a latticed brace instead of a shear wall. The energy dissipation takes place only in the vertical elements of the steel frame subjected mainly to axial forces without involving the reinforcements of the infill walls. Detailing of the connection of the dissipating elements should allow their replacement and the possible use of buckling-restrained elements. The formation of the diagonal strut is ensured by joint stiffeners and bearing plates (Figure 2). The joint may be welded in shops allowing speeding up the erection phases. The stud connectors are not required to transfer shear forces but they are used to connect the infill and the frame together during the seismic shakings...|$|E
40|$|Civil {{engineers}} are presently {{faced with the}} challenge of strengthening and repairing many existing structures to assure or increase their structural safety. The reasons for this include changes in the use of structures, and increased traffic loads on bridges. In Iraq, for example, several highway bridges needed to accommodate increased axle load during the transportation of huge turbines for electricity generating stations. The requirement for structural strengthening and repair methods is, however, driven by the worldwide need to ensure the safety and sustainability of our aging infrastructure which is deteriorating at a rate faster than it can be renovated. The ever increasing damage caused by environmental effects and the corrosion of steel and deterioration of concrete, reduce structural safety and lead to disruption for the users, which can have serious economic consequences. In a plate girder bridge, the plate girders are typically I-beams made up from separate structural steel plates (rather than rolled as a single cross-section), which are welded or, in older bridges, bolted or riveted together to form the vertical web and horizontal flanges of the beam. The two primary functions of the web plate in a plate girder are to maintain a relative distance between the top and bottom flanges and to resist the induced shear stresses. In most practical ranges of plate girder bridges’ spans, the induced shear stresses are relatively low compared to the bending stresses in the flanges induced by flexure. As a result the web plate is generally chosen to be much thinner than the flanges. The web panel consequently buckles at a relatively low shear force. For steel girder structures dominated by cyclic loading, {{as is the case with}} repeated vehicle axle loads on bridges, this can lead to the so-called ‘breathing’ phenomenon; an out-of-plane buckling displacement that can induce high secondary bending stresses at the welded plate boundaries. In the current work, a novel FRP strengthening technique using bonded shapes is applied to resist these out of plane deformations, and hence reduce the breathing stresses, and improve the fatigue life of the plate girder which is very different to the majority of applications of FRP strengthening that exploit the FRP for its direct tensile strength and stiffness. The objective of the current experimental programme is to strengthen thinwalled steel girders against web shear buckling using a corrugated CFRP or GFRP panel bonded externally along the <b>compression</b> <b>diagonal</b> of the web plate. The programme was divided into three main phases, including: (1) the development of a new preformed corrugated FRP panel, and (2, 3) testing its performance in two main experimental series. The initial series involved tests on 13 steel plates strengthened with the proposed preformed corrugated FRP panel and subjected to in-plane shear loading using a specially manufactured “picture-frame” arrangement designed to induce the appropriate boundary conditions and stresses in the web plates. This initial test series investigated the performance of different forms of strengthening under static load, in preparation for another series of cyclic tests to investigate their fatigue performance. The test variables included FRP type (CFRP or GFRP), form of FRP (closed or open section), number of FRP layers, and orientation of GFRP fibres used to produce the FRP panel. In the second series, six specimens were manufactured to simulate the end panel of a plate girder. These were strengthened with the optimized FRP panel from the initial series and tested for shear buckling under repeated cyclic loading with a stress range 40 - 80...|$|E
40|$|Earth constructions {{constitute}} {{an important and}} {{significant part of the}} World’s built heritage. This type of constructions shows also great presence in Portugal, specially, in the regions of Aveiro (Silveira et al. 2010), Alentejo and Algarve (Correia et al. 2007), despite that building in earth gradually felled into disuse during the last century. In these regions, the existing earth constructions are, however, found often extensively degraded and structurally damaged. The responsibility for this situation can be partially attributed to the systematic abandon of these buildings by the inhabitants, who leave them unprotected and without their required and essential maintenance. Nevertheless, there is, currently, lack of knowledge and of tools that would allow repairing and strengthening adequately this kind of buildings. Generating this knowledge and tools would aid opposing to the gradual disappearing of earth constructions, and eventually, lead to the reversing of this abandon tendency. Nowadays, grout injection is a feasible and a reliable solution to consolidate historical masonry structures. Nevertheless it requires a design methodology to be followed in order to result on a successful and adequate intervention, since the composition of the grout must fulfill requirements demanded by the construction, such as the compatibility between materials and the level of improvement of the structural behavior. In this context, years of practice and research {{led to the development of}} ternary grouts (composed by cement, lime and pozzolan) as an alternative to grouts based exclusively on cement or on organic resins, which have, in general, compatibility problems with historical masonry. On the other hand, the composition of ternary grouts is more similar to that of historical mortars, so they are expected to have improved compatibility. A similar analogy can be made for the case of grouting interventions on earth constructions. Thereby, a compatible grout would, necessarily, require the incorporation of earth in its composition (mud grout). Accordingly, some researchers and conservationists have already performed some tests and trials on mud grouts used for repairing cracks on adobe walls (e. g. : Vargas et al. 2008). They showed to be possible recovering, or even surpassing, the initial strength of the walls after repairing them through grouting with unstabilized mud grouts (without addition of mineral binders). Moreover, repairs with unstabilized mud grouts showed better mechanical performance than those with addition of cement and lime (Vargas et al. 2008). However, the knowledge about this type of grouts is still at an initial stage. Problems, such as the excessive shrinkage, the incapacity to inject smaller cracks and low fluidity, demand further research on the material and structural fields. In this context, the current PhD research aims at further developing the knowledge on mud grouts, by understanding their behavior as a repairing material and their effect/improvement on the structural behavior of earth constructions. Designing a mud grout is a complex task, since its required properties are defined as function of characteristics of the earth construction. These properties must regard not only the structural behavior of the construction, but also the durability. Thus, the main properties that control the design of a mud grout are: strength, fresh-state rheology, fresh-state stability, bond, chemical stability and microstructure. Since these properties are related between each other, adjusting the composition in order to improve one property has consequences on the others (Silva et al. 2010 a). In addition, the heterogeneity of the main component, which is earth, influences greatly the behavior of the mud grout. Therefore, it is extremely complex to design a grout without deeply knowing the components to be incorporated. Recent tests performed by the authors on aqueous suspensions of kaolin revealed that the clay fraction (size < 2 m) composing a mud grout greatly influences its behavior during the fresh state (Silva et al. 2010 b). This fraction limits the fluidity of the mud grout (rheologic behavior) due to its colloid behavior, which depends mainly on the particle size distribution and shape, clay mineralogy, and pH and ionic strength of the suspension. Nevertheless, non-purified clay particles tend to associate in aqueous suspension (pH close to neutral values and high ionic strength), forming a gel that opposes to the flowing (e. g. : Van Olphen 1977). As consequence, the mud grout needs very high water content in order to reach adequate fluidity, which results on excessive drying shrinkage of the hardened grout. Reducing the clay fraction in the mud grout allows further decreasing the demand of water. Thus, the particle size distribution (PSD) of the solid phase can be corrected by adding coarse material. This material needs to be mainly constituted by particles with the size of the silt fraction (size between 60 and 2 m), in order to grant a stable suspension and thus avoid segregation and bleeding. Accordingly, the authors tested kaolin suspensions corrected with different percentages of limestone powder, which allowed, in fact, decreasing substantially the demand of water. Still, the water content was too high for a grout. Further improvement was achieved by adding little quantities of sodium hexametaphosphate (HMP), i. e., a deflocculant /dispersant for clays. The combined action of the addition of HMP and the correction of the PSD with limestone powder allowed decreasing the water content to values close to 30 %, and at the same time, obtaining fluid suspensions. Other properties, besides rheological parameters, were evaluated in a composition study, where the variables were the water content, the kaolin/limestone powder ratio and amount of added HMP. Such properties were the fresh state stability, the strength and the bond between the grout and earthen beams of small dimension. The results showed that the strength (flexural and compressive) of the grouts rather depends on the clay content, and the higher, the stronger is the grout. Regarding the bond, the tested grouts granted at least a recovery of 60 % of the original flexural strength of the earthen beams after being repaired. However, further investigation requires using larger specimens, since the earth used to prepare the beams was sieved to remove the particles larger than 2 mm, which resulted on flexural strength values higher than those of ordinary earthen materials. Further research is required at a macro-level. Thereby, the following step is to test the mud grouts applied to earth constructions walls. Thus, an experimental program is being prepared at the Civil Engineering Lab of University of Minho. Several adobe masonry and rammed earth walls are going to be tested under <b>compression,</b> <b>diagonal</b> compression and shear-compression, which will be subsequently repaired by grout injection, and then they will be retested.

First we present a unified framework which captures all stable ideals as the kernels of limits of <b>diagonal</b> <b>compressions.</b> We then characterize when two such limits give rise to the same ideal, and we obtain detailed information of the structure of sums and intersections of ideals. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Several masonry {{panels are}} studied {{by means of}} {{destructive}} tests such as compressive, <b>diagonal</b> <b>compression</b> and shear-compression tests. The experimental research allows to characterize the mechanical properties of masonry walls {{in order to assess}} the masonry performance.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a broad experimental investigation conducted through <b>diagonal</b> <b>compression</b> tests on masonry specimens strengthened with a mortar coating applied on both surfaces of the wall and reinforced with a glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) mesh. Four types of masonry, three different types of masonry mortar and five diverse GFRP meshes for the reinforcement were considered. In particular, solid brick masonry 250 and 380 mm thick, two-leaf brick masonry with rubble conglomerate infill and rubble stone masonry were tested. The <b>diagonal</b> <b>compression</b> tests, performed on 60 square masonry specimens with loading-unloading cycles up to the collapse, evidenced a good effectiveness of the strengthening technique in terms of both resistance and ductility. Results also showed the resistance increment in reinforced samples is generally greater for weaker masonry types and, referring to a single masonry type, for specimens built with a weaker mortar. Furthermore, the different GFRP meshes influenced very little the resistance of specimens, but higher reinforcement contents induced a lower decrease of the diagonal load after the cracking...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study performed on brick masonry panels strengthened by Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) laminates is here proposed. A series of 9 plain and 24 strengthened panels {{have been subjected}} to <b>diagonal</b> <b>compression</b> tests. The use of three type of fibers (carbon, glass and polyvinyl-alcohol, characterized by different strength and stiffness) applied in different configurations (at one side or both sides) and geometry (as a squared grid or diagonally) on the faces of the walls have been considered...|$|R
5000|$|Frank J. Vecchio {{defined the}} {{original}} form of MCFT in 1982 from {{the testing of}} 30 reinforced concrete panels subjected to uniform strain states in a specially built tester. The theory of MCFT traces back through the Compression Field Theory of 1978 to the <b>Diagonal</b> <b>compression</b> Field Theory of 1974. The definitive description of the MCFT is in the 1986 American Concrete Institute paper [...] "The Modified Compression Field Theory for Reinforced Concrete Elements Subjected to Shear".|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} {{research}} work, an attempt is made to increase the seismic capacity of unreinforced masonry (URM) structures by proposing a new composite material which can improve shear strength and deformation capacity of URM wall systems. Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) having high tensile and shear stiffness can significantly increase in-plane and out-of-plane strength of masonry walls, but, inherently, FRP strengthened wall systems exhibit brittle failure under extreme seismic loading. Polypropylene (PP-band) is a low cost material with sufficient ductility and deformation capacity. Keeping in view the behavior of FRP and PP-band, a composite of FRP and PP-band is proposed for retrofitting of URM walls. Mechanical behavior of the proposed composite material is assessed by carrying out an in-plane <b>diagonal</b> <b>compression</b> test and an out-of-plane bending test on twenty-five 1 / 4 -scaled masonry wall panels. Experimental plan for each panel, URM, PP-band retrofitted, FRP retrofitted and FRP + PP-band retrofitted masonry, is <b>diagonal</b> <b>compression</b> test and three-point bending test. Experimental results have determined that FRP + PP-band composite increased, not only the initial peak strength, but also the ductility, deformation capacity and residual strength of URM wall systems...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{simplified}} modeling approach {{for the analysis}} of the in-plane shear behavior of tuff stone masonry panels strengthened with a surface bonded composite Basalt Textile Reinforced Mortar (BTRM) system subjected to <b>diagonal</b> <b>compression.</b> The nonlinear behavior of the unreinforced and reinforced panels is reproduced by means of a macroscopic smeared crack approach. The masonry is modeled as an isotropic continuum material characterized by different nonlinear softening laws in tension and compression. The BTRM composite is modeled with two layers representing the basalt textile and the matrix with different constitutive relationships. Sensitivity numerical analyses are developed in order to investigate the influence of each parameter in the global nonlinear response of the panel. Then, representative numerical models for the unreinforced and the reinforced panel are presented. Two BTRM layouts are investigated: single-side and double-side reinforcement. The models aim to capture the main aspects of the observed experimental nonlinear response, such as stiffness, strength-deformation shear capacity and failure mechanism. The numerical results are compared with the experimental outcomes of <b>diagonal</b> <b>compression</b> tests to investigate the feasibility of the models in the description of the in-plane shear behavior of tuff stone panels strengthened with the BTRM system...|$|R
5000|$|The Pratt truss was {{patented}} in 1844 by two Boston railway engineers, Caleb Pratt {{and his son}} Thomas Willis Pratt. [...] The design uses vertical {{members for}} <b>compression</b> and <b>diagonal</b> members to respond to tension. The Pratt truss design remained popular as bridge designers switched from wood to iron, and from iron to steel. [...] This continued popularity of the Pratt truss is {{probably due to the}} fact that the configuration of the members means that longer diagonal members are only in tension for gravity load effects. This allows these members to be used more efficiently, as slenderness effects related to buckling under compression loads (which are compounded by the length of the member) will typically not control the design. Therefore, for given planar truss with a fixed depth, the Pratt configuration is usually the most efficient under static, vertical loading.|$|R
