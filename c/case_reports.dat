Fifteen <b>cases</b> (29  %) noted ethnicity to be “White,” 13 <b>cases</b> (25  %) <b>reported</b> origin from the “Far East,” 6 <b>cases</b> (11.5  %) <b>reported</b> race as “Black,” 3 <b>cases</b> (5.7  %) <b>reported</b> race as “Hispanic,” 1 <b>case</b> <b>reported</b> “Indian” origin, and 1 <b>case</b> <b>reported</b> “Middle Eastern” origin.|$|R
5|$|In a {{large-scale}} study of programs where bupropion {{was used for}} smoking cessation or treatment of depression, no withdrawal symptoms were observed. As of 2002 there were two <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> of people experiencing withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing buproprion taken to aid smoking cessation; the prescribing information states that dose tapering is not required when discontinuing treatment for smoking cessation.|$|E
5|$|After several <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> in the 18th and 19th centuries, {{periodic}} paralysis {{was first}} described in full by the German neurologist Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833–1890) in 1885. In 1926 the Japanese physician Tetsushiro Shinosaki, from Fukuoka, observed {{the high rate}} of thyroid disease in Japanese people with periodic paralysis. The first English-language report, in 1931, originated from Dunlap and Kepler, physicians at the Mayo Clinic; they described the condition in a patient with features of Graves' disease. In 1937 periodic paralysis was linked with hypokalemia, as well as precipitation of attacks with glucose and insulin. This phenomenon {{has been used as a}} diagnostic test.|$|E
5|$|Numerous <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> exist {{from before}} the twentieth century, but were {{influenced}} greatly by the methods and thinking used in that time. By the early twentieth century, it was becoming increasingly evident that rumination presented itself {{in a variety of}} ways in response to a variety of conditions. Although still considered a disorder of infancy and cognitive disability at that time, the difference in presentation between infants and adults was well established.|$|E
30|$|Clinical patient {{characteristics}} and IHT characteristics were prospectively recorded. Data were collected through a <b>case</b> <b>report</b> form {{in part by}} the porter for nonmedical data and by the resident for medical data and adverse events during IHT. This <b>case</b> <b>report</b> form was created for the study and also included the transport protocol of our ICU. <b>Case</b> <b>report</b> forms were stocked with airway equipment. So for every IHT of ventilated patient, a <b>case</b> <b>report</b> form was distributed by the porter and recovered within 1 hour after patient return to his room when storing airway equipment. All <b>case</b> <b>report</b> forms were recovered by one of the investigators each day.|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{recognition of}} pancreatic cancer has {{been attributed to}} the 18th-century Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Morgagni, the historical father of modern-day anatomic pathology, who claimed to have traced several cases of cancer in the pancreas. Many 18th and 19th-century physicians were skeptical about the existence of the disease, given the similar appearance of pancreatitis. Some <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> were published in the 1820s and 1830s, and a genuine histopathologic diagnosis was eventually recorded by the American clinician Jacob Mendes Da Costa, who also doubted the reliability of Morgagni's interpretations. By the start of the 20th century, cancer of the head of the pancreas had become a well-established diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet may be {{a successful}} treatment for several rare metabolic diseases. <b>Case</b> <b>reports</b> of two children indicate that it {{may be a}} possible treatment for astrocytomas, a type of brain tumour. Autism, depression, migraine headaches, polycystic ovary syndrome and diabetes mellitus type 2 have also been shown to improve in small case studies. There is evidence from uncontrolled clinical trials and studies in animal models that the ketogenic diet can provide symptomatic and disease-modifying activity in a broad range of neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and may be protective in traumatic brain injury and stroke.|$|E
5|$|There {{have not}} been any {{controlled}} studies on meth mouth, and several of its aspects are unclear. Although the condition has been popularized by media coverage and <b>case</b> <b>reports,</b> no systematic {{studies have been conducted}} to conclusively tie methamphetamine use to symptoms that are commonly described as meth mouth. There are few ties between dental scholars and those who study drug use, and it can be difficult for dental researchers to find methamphetamine users to study.|$|E

In the Vågsbygd police district it was reported that there were over 50 cases, going down 27% since 2012. At Randesund police station it was 61 <b>cases</b> <b>reported,</b> so had gone down 9% from 2012 to 2013. Outside of Kvadraturen, Vågsbygd and Randesund there were 110 <b>cases</b> <b>reported</b> in the municipality, mostly from Grim.|$|R
5|$|Anxiety {{disorder}} and {{major depressive disorder}} {{are the most common}} conditions seen at the same time; comorbidity of these in persons with AS is estimated at 65%. Reports have associated AS with medical conditions such as aminoaciduria and ligamentous laxity, but these have been <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> or small studies and no factors have been associated with AS across studies. One study of males with AS found an increased rate of epilepsy and a high rate (51%) of nonverbal learning disorder. AS is associated with tics, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar disorder, and the repetitive behaviors of AS have many similarities with the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive {{disorder and}} obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. However many of these studies are based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.|$|E
5|$|Lung {{cancer was}} {{uncommon}} {{before the advent}} of cigarette smoking; it was not even recognized as a distinct disease until 1761. Different aspects of lung cancer were described further in 1810. Malignant lung tumors made up only 1% of all cancers seen at autopsy in 1878, but had risen to 10–15% by the early 1900s. <b>Case</b> <b>reports</b> in the medical literature numbered only 374 worldwide in 1912, but a review of autopsies showed the incidence of lung cancer had increased from 0.3% in 1852 to 5.66% in 1952. In Germany in 1929, physician Fritz Lickint recognized the link between smoking and lung cancer, which led to an aggressive antismoking campaign. The British Doctors' Study, published in the 1950s, was the first solid epidemiological evidence of the link between lung cancer and smoking. As a result, in 1964 the Surgeon General of the United States recommended smokers should stop smoking.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based early {{intervention}} programs, most are <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> {{of up to}} five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored. Despite the popularity of social skills training, its effectiveness is not firmly established. A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children. Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{support the}} safety of antivenom, with around a 5% chance of an acute reaction, 1–2% of {{anaphylaxis}} and 10% chance of a delayed reaction due to serum sickness. Nevertheless, {{it is recommended that}} an injection of adrenaline be ready and available in case it is needed to treat a severe anaphylactic reaction, and also that the antivenom from the vial be administered diluted in a 100 ml bag of intravenous solution for infusion over 30 minutes. While it is rare that patients report symptoms of envenomation lasting weeks or months following a bite, there are <b>case</b> <b>reports</b> from the 1990s in which antivenom was reported to be effective in the relief of chronic symptoms when administered weeks or months after a bite, however, {{in the vast majority of}} cases, it is administered within 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|The eastern {{green mamba}} {{is a highly}} venomous snake. The venom {{consists}} of both pre-synaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins (dendrotoxins), cardiotoxins, calcicludine, and fasciculins. The average venom yield per bite is 80mg according to Engelmann and Obst (1981), while Minton (1974) gives it a range of 60–95mg (dry weight). The subcutaneous LD50 is 1.3mg/kg. The LD50 in mice through the IV route is 0.45mg/kg. Like all other mamba species, the toxicity of individual specimens within the same species can vary greatly based on several factors including geographical region, age, seasonal variation, diet, and so on. Local swelling is variable and sometimes absent after mamba bites. However, patients bitten by the eastern green mamba develop swelling of the entire bitten limb and also show mild haemostatic disturbances (Warrell DA; MacKay et al. 1966). The rare cases of local tissue damage usually resulted from bites on the fingers {{or the use of}} a tight tourniquet. This species has caused bites to humans and many of the bites attributed to this species have often resulted in fatalities. The mortality rate of untreated bites is unknown but is thought to be quite high. Symptoms of envenomation by this species include swelling of the bite site, dizziness, and nausea, accompanied by difficulty breathing and swallowing, irregular heartbeat, convulsions, rapid progression to respiratory paralysis. Bites that produce severe envenomation can be rapidly fatal. <b>Case</b> <b>reports</b> of rapidly fatal outcomes, in as little as 30 minutes, have been recorded for this species.|$|E
