40|$|Purpose ? This paper aims to {{incorporate}} material derived from four case study analyses of industrial business-to-business relationships. Although {{there is a}} substantial amount of literature on the concept of power, there is little academic research studying the ?perception? of power ? especially that of key customers? suppliers ? relative to that of the buying company. This paper develops a framework, which provides a different set of perceptions regarding the nature of supplier-key customer relationship. Design/methodology/approach ? The case studies involve four firms that have been long-term suppliers to a number of global industrial companies and who have set up key account programs to work with them. Three suppliers are in the corrugated cardboard industry (two large and one medium-sized company) and one supplier (a medium-sized company) is in the <b>coding</b> <b>equipment</b> industry. Findings ? The study develops a power framework, which can be used in the analysis of buyer/supplier power and points out the risk that can arise when {{one or more of the}} parties involved operates on the basis of perceptions that are incorrect. Originality/value ? The results suggest that the actors? power perceptions are important constructs, which have so far been neglected in the academic literature, and stress the role of ?subjectivity? in the actors? analysis of power...|$|E

25|$|Codes and {{standards}} have repeatedly {{been identified as}} a major institutional barrier to deploying hydrogen technologies and developing a hydrogen economy.

25|$|In 1944, the Swedes {{worked with}} Finnish Intelligence {{to set up}} a stay-behind network of agents within Finland to keep track of post-war {{activities}} in that country. While this network was allegedly never put in place, Finnish <b>codes,</b> SIGINT <b>equipment</b> and documents were brought to Sweden and apparently exploited until the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|It {{was soon}} {{realized}} that {{there would have to}} be some sort of industry standard set. In 1970, the Universal Grocery Products Identification Code or UGPIC was written by a company called Logicon Inc. The first company to produce bar <b>code</b> <b>equipment</b> for retail trade use (using UGPIC) was the American company Monarch Marking in 1970, and for industrial use, the British company Plessey Telecommunications was also first in 1970. UGPIC evolved into the U.P.C. symbol set or Universal Product Code, which is still used in the United States. George J. Laurer is considered the inventor of U.P.C. or Uniform Product Code, which was invented in 1973.In June 1974, the first U.P.C. scanner was installed at a Marsh's supermarket in Troy, Ohio. The first product to have a barcode included was a packet of Wrigley's Gum.|$|R

50|$|The unit's title {{harks back to}} the {{original}} 30 Commando (which in turn became 30 Assault Unit RM), formed in 1942. This unit was tasked to move ahead of advancing Allied forces, or to undertake covert infiltrations into enemy territory by land, sea or air, to capture much needed intelligence, in the form of <b>codes,</b> documents, <b>equipment</b> or enemy personnel.|$|R
25|$|Then on 7 March 1942, a {{top secret}} small RAAF Intercept Station {{was set up}} in 2 houses at Pimlico in Townsville under Wing Commander Booth. The two houses backed on to each other, one being at 21 Sycamore Street, Pimlico and the other being at 24 French Street, Pimlico. Operators based in these houses would {{intercept}} Japanese wireless signals and break the Japanese KANA <b>code.</b> Radio <b>equipment</b> was installed in No. 24 French Street.|$|R

40|$|Since August 1994 Kurchatov Institute in {{cooperation}} with several US Department of Energy Laboratories has been developing a site-wide computerized material accounting system for nuclear materials. In 1994 a prototype system was put into trial operation at two Kurchatov facilities. Evaluation of this prototype {{led to the development}} of a new computerized material accounting system named KI-MACS, which has been operational since 1996. This system is a site-wide local secure computer network with centralized database capable of dealing with strictly confidential data and performing near-real time accountancy. It utilizes a Microsoft Windows NT operating system with SQL Server and Visual Basic, and has a `star`-like network architecture. KI-MACS is capable of dealing with materials in itemized and bulk form, and can perform statistical evaluations of measurements and material balance. KI-MACS is fully integrated with bar <b>code</b> <b>equipment,</b> electronic scales, gamma-ray spectrometers and an Active Well Coincidence Counter, thus providing almost on-line evaluation and utilization of results of measurements, item identification and accounting. At present KI-MACS is being used in Physical Inventory Taking at the Kurchatov Central Storage Facility, and by the end of 1997 will be installed at twelve Kurchatov nuclear facilities...|$|R

50|$|After intense {{study of}} the Japanese language, I was {{stationed}} at Arlington Hall {{as part of the}} 2nd Sig Serv Bn. I was given training in cryptography at Vint Hills Farms before the stint at Arlington Hall. We were reading the 1944 Japanese Army General Codebook. There were always glitches, both from faulty reception and failure to break the monthly cyphers. It was our job to fill these in (guess at them) and get the translated messages to McArthur's HQ in the Pacific. We were aided by several two-story barracks filled with IBM computers (then called punch-card tabulators). In January, the new 1945 codebook was published by the Japanese and we were pretty much back to square one. Myself and another expendable Lt. were sent to the Pacific looking for captured <b>code</b> <b>equipment.</b> Our knowledge of what it looked like would supposedly qualify us to find such. No luck on Saipan. 1st Marines did find the code books in the catacombs under Shuri Castle. Back at AH we translated and decrypted, until one day I got a message with a new word: Genshi Bakudan...atom bomb. War ended. From there it was to Japan to interview civilians and military (USSBS). Then discharge and back to Texas.|$|R
