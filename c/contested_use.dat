40|$|The {{fair use}} {{doctrine}} permits certain uses of copyrighted material that are unauthorized by the copyright holder. In 1984, the Supreme Court decided in Sony v. Universal Studios (Sony) that unauthorized home taping of television programs {{was a fair}} use of such programs. Decried by the dissent and frequently contested in ensuing cases, that decision sealed the majority 2 ̆ 7 s case that the videotape recorder was capable of substantial non-infringing uses and therefore legal. In the twenty years since Sony, the dissent 2 ̆ 7 s skepticism about the fairness of time-shifting has gotten about as warm a reception in appellate courts as the majority 2 ̆ 7 s position. Courts have been sharply divided on how to assess {{the effect of a}} <b>contested</b> <b>use</b> on the market for or value of the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s copyrighted work - a key factor in fair use analysis. The Sony majority broadly considered the effect of the <b>contested</b> <b>use</b> on the value of the copyrighted work overall, rather than narrowly considering its effect on the licensing market most directly affected by the <b>contested</b> <b>use.</b> Unfortunately, many recent appellate decisions have cut this inquiry short by ignoring the majority 2 ̆ 7 s method and only evaluating the effect of the <b>contested</b> <b>use</b> on very narrow licensing markets. If the dissent were correct, this fair use factor would always militate against a fair use finding. Nevertheless, its narrow approach has informed effect on the market analysis in several leading fair uses cases, and proven decisive to their resolutions. The Sony majority has all too often been ignored by appellate courts reluctant to examine the full range of economic effects flowing from a given use. After introducing the fair use doctrine generally in Part 2, this piece focuses on the debate between the dissent and the majority in Sony over the fourth fair use factor in Part 3. Part 4 sketches an economic rationale for the Sony majority 2 ̆ 7 s fourth factor analysis, focusing on network effects, externalities, and the impossibility of forcing compensation for all complementarity in a modern market economy. Although Grokster may have muddied its authority on issues of secondary liability, Sony 2 ̆ 7 s lesson for analysis of the fourth fair use factor is clear. Assessing the effect of a new technology on the value of a copyrighted work always involves the evaluation of several markets for the work - some of which may only be possible due to the technology at issue, and all of which are bound to be affected in different ways and to a different extent if the use becomes widespread. Courts should not cut the analysis short by simply focusing on one negatively affected market...|$|E

Margaret Jane Radin, Contested Commodities. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1996. Pp. xiv, 279. 35. 00. It {{was made}} clear long ago that {{property}} and value are different things. Value exists. It is a fact. It can arise from law, and much of law aims at creating more value in the world. But value can also arise in spite of law (consider, for example, the fortunes that bootleggers made during the Roaring Twenties), or in law 2 ̆ 7 s interstices. When a particular value arises {{despite a lack of}} explicit legal protection, its possessors often ask courts or legislatures to give them a legal entitlement to preserve and further exploit that value. Typically the holders demand (1) a liberty to employ the valued thing; (2) a right to exclude others from using it; and (3) a power to transfer the rights of exclusion and liberties of use to a market buyer. Taken together, these three entitlements - to use, to exclude, and to alienate - are recognizable as property. The law of intellectual property and unfair competition must continually decide which valuable things and behaviors should be subject to private control, and whether that control should take the form of 2 ̆ 2 property. 2 ̆ 2 Such decisions are not necessary with regard only to newly developed technologies. Courts are called upon to make similar decisions about long-established media, including books. For example, copyright courts often must decide whether the 2 ̆ 2 fair use 2 ̆ 2 doctrine justifies or excuses a prima facie violation of a copyright owner 2 ̆ 7 s exclusive right - an open-ended inquiry that boils down to a determination that the <b>contested</b> <b>use</b> is or is not subject to the owner 2 ̆ 7 s property right. Sometimes 2 ̆ 2 fair use 2 ̆ 2 treatment is justified by a finding that no market is available to exploit the <b>contested</b> <b>use,</b> but sometimes copyright courts seem to distrust the market even when available.

Two everyday domestic objects: the father’s chair and the grandfather clock are examined and analysed, drawing on John Gillis’ work on ritualised family spaces and contested notions of time (Gillis, 1996). Both these objects resonate with the <b>contested</b> <b>use</b> of domestic space and the layered meanings of family time in working-class lives, not least because both are often remembered in autobiographical accounts of home and family. The special place of the father’s chair highlighted the feminising of the home and accompanying development of rituals to welcome and ensconce the father in his domestic domain each day. The sound of clocks underpinned the bringing together of industrial time, separating leisure and work for those at school or employment away from home, {{and at the same time}} conveying the cyclical nature of family life and its everyday routines from day to day, year to year and generation to generation. Memories of chairs and clocks embedded in autobiographies offer important evidence about the images, sounds and sensory experiences which resonated most powerfully when remembering and composing a the hierarchies and tensions of working-class family life...|$|E

In recent times these assessments have come under increased scrutiny, as critics claim that the statistical techniques underlying them might reproduce existing patterns of discrimination and historical biases that are reflected in the data. Much of this debate is centered around competing notions of fairness and predictive accuracy, resting on the <b>contested</b> <b>use</b> of variables that act as "proxies" for characteristics legally protected against discrimination, such as race and gender.

In addition, the new Curriculum does not list a specific content, which allows the individual teacher large freedom to teach as much or as little about the past as they like. Moreover, what have been emphasised are subjects like science and technology, as well as learning practical skills of "constitutional value". In addition, phrases like "the new patriotism" and "allegiance to the flag" seems to be a recent way to create and promote a shared South African identity...|$|E
40|$|In {{the face}} of a growing media storm in Australia that sensationalises the {{phenomenon}} of freedom camping through a divisive portrayal of its influence on regional and urban communities, we present a conceptual framework which we consider will aid investigation of our understandings of freedom camping as a form of ‘street life’ and <b>contested</b> <b>use</b> of public space. It is not unusual for local news to include sectoral-interest commentaries and debates about campers and camping impacts: Are they free-campers or simply freeloaders? In the void of any consistency across states and territories and unambiguous national policy to support local communities and government to effectively deal with the conflict that inevitably arises, we go against recent trends in policy discourse, which focus on governance and other ‘newer’ concepts, as we seek to bring the concept of power back to the centre of analyses of policy using freedom camping as the vehicle. As linkages and connections between conceptualisations and theories of power and tourism and leisure studies are unevenly developed, we wish to place constructs of power more firmly at the centre of the agenda of critical tourism research. We do not engage in a treatise of theories for studying power; rather what we present is a framework capable of encapsulating diverse approaches to studying power in the context of leisure and tourism public policy. Freedom camping in Australia refers to touring consumers who occupy, by deliberate choice, a vehicle as a mode of accommodation in an open space that is not bound by market-based commercial norms and caravan park-based regulations. We acknowledge freedom camping is not a recent phenomenon, nor is it unique to Australia, though its prominence is raising the ire of civic leaders concerned for their respective leisure, policy, management and regulatory environments that support freedom and commercial camping practices...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for {{authenticity}} and for the experience of past in postmodern societies. Built heritage {{is one of the}} main driver of tourist’s choice for destinations, thus place based development initiatives in many cases are based on the built heritages of places. Heritage tourism is more and more important in the economic and social development of Hungarian regions and settlements too. Scholars mostly focus on demands and authenticity perceptions of tourists, however the tourism development and also the perceived authenticity have significant impact on the changes of local societies. This paper presents two Hungarian case studies on how local societies perceive and use their built heritage and how their authenticity perception and local identity are changed by the local tourism development. The paper analyses an urban and a local case characterized by the high importance of built heritage in tourism development. The first case study analyses the temporary use and tourism based perceptions of the 19 th century housing stocks in the 7 th District of Budapest. While the rural case study presents the touristic use and image of the 19 th century peasant buildings in Őrség micro region in the Western part of Hungary. Case studies focus perceptions of authenticity of locals and their interests toward their built heritage. The analysis purpose to explore how local’s perceptions and identity are shaped by the tourism destination’s public relations efforts to construct and convey local image. Case study present the key actors of local heritage tourism and their interests and attitudes towards local built heritage. We examine the conflicts connected to the different perceptions and uses of built heritage. Our findings show that important differences in perceived authenticity were observed among various groups of locals.

40|$|Exhibitions {{have always}} been {{at the heart of}} the modern art world. They are contested sites, where the joint forces of the art objects, their social agents, and {{institutional}} spaces temporarily intersect and provide a visual arrangement to specific audiences, whose interpretations feed back into the discourse on art. From this perspective, “contemporary Chinese art,” both as phenomenon and discursive category referring to specific dimensions of artistic production in China post- 1979, was mediated through various exhibitions that took place in the People’s Republic of China. After 1989, exhibitions of artworks from the PRC in European and North American museums significantly contributed to the broadening of Western knowledge about this artistic production. Since then, the two strains of exhibition activities grew while becoming increasingly entangled and the discursive category of “contemporary Chinese art” has gone global. This paper reviews the beginnings of this complex process by investigating the conditions that configured the first large group exhibition of contemporary Chinese art from the PRC in Europe after 1979 : the travelling group show China Avantgarde, which opened in Berlin in early 1993. The first part of the paper explores the wider historical conditions that impacted on the exhibition by contextualizing the event in relation to two important, if very different forerunners: the 1989 shows Zhongguo xiandai yishu zhan. China/Avantgarde in Beijing and Magiciens de la terre in Paris. Yet the important entanglements between the respective curatorial concepts, affiliated art discourses, and the agents involved are also analysed. Constituting a specific network of mediators, mediating factors, and mediating institutions, these forerunners influenced the making of China Avantgarde in Berlin three years later. The second part of the paper discusses the Berlin exhibition in detail. It argues that the title reflects the <b>contested</b> <b>use</b> of the discursive categories “avant-garde” and “modern art” in Beijing and Berlin at the time, which helped translate and thereby shape a certain image of contemporary Chinese art beyond the actual artworks on display. Of paricular interes are the concerns of the European curators, who had to overcome various political, logistic, as well as conceptual challenges when selecting artists and artworks. Examining the catalogue as an instance where diverging strategies of how to present artworks from thePRC become visible, the paper argues that China Avantgarde was not so much a clear-cut, singular, and–by now–canonical event, but formed as well as informed a complex canonizing process that is still relevant today...|$|E
40|$|The 1976 Act announces broad {{exclusive}} rights, {{offset by}} {{a myriad of}} specific exemptions, and one wide exception for “fair use. ” In words and intent, the exclusive rights are capacious, but new technologies may have caused some of the general phrases to become more constraining than {{might have been expected}} from a text whose drafters took pains to make forward-looking. Thus, the scope of the reproduction right turns on the meaning of “copy;” the reach of the distribution right on “distribute copies” and “transfer of ownership;” the range of the public performance right on “public” and “perform. ” Entrepreneurs and users of new technological means of exploiting copyrighted works have urged narrow constructions of each of these terms, arguing that broad interpretations will chill future innovation (and suppress present markets for copyright-exploiting devices or services). Copyright owners, concerned that unfettered new uses will supplant traditional copyright-controlled markets, have contended that the literal language, or, failing that, congressional intent, encompass the <b>contested</b> <b>use.</b> In addition, new technologies have called into question the identification of the person who “does” the copyright-implicating acts. Who makes a copy when the act is decomposed into steps taken by different actors? Who performs or displays a work when the work resides on one person’s server, but the public perceives it through another person’s website? Several US courts have narrowly construed the reach of the exclusive rights of reproduction, distribution, public performance and public display, thus putting into doubt their efficacy in the digital environment. In particular, the Second Circuit’s recent decision in Cartoon Networks v. CSC Holdings, if followed, could substantially eviscerate the reproduction and public performance rights. The growing number of decisions rejecting a “making available” right attests to some difficulties in adapting the distribution right to online exploitation. By contrast, one bright spot for authors appears in the area of moral rights, in which digital media may provide a means to make at least some authors’ attribution interests enforceable. Because the decisions emanate from lower courts, including first-level courts, {{it is too soon to}} discern whether US copyright law is adopting a constricted conception of the scope of the economic rights under copyright, and if so, whether the decisions betoken an evolving (if often unarticulated) determination that copyright prerogatives should yield to technological preferences.
