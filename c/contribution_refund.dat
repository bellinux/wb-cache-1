It presents three possible methods of refunding contributions: a repatriation bonus, an individual pension reserve and an ‘opt-in’ scheme. These three schemes are tested on two countries: the Netherlands and the United States of America. The test reflects the interests of different stakeholders: the migrant workers themselves, the migrant workers’ countries of origin and the host countries. The article concludes that whether <b>refunding</b> social insurance <b>contributions</b> to temporary migrant workers is an attractive policy alternative strongly depends on the national context. For specific social security programmes in the United States, the article suggests that <b>contribution</b> <b>refunding</b> might be worth considering. But on the whole it concludes that <b>refunding</b> <b>contributions</b> can only be a second best solution. Aiming for proper national standards of protection for migrant workers, supplemented by a network of international social security agreements still presents the most honourable course. status: publishe...|$|R

Johnson reportedly made seven contributions in 2005 and 2006 totalling $1,850.

40|$|We {{characterize}} {{generally the}} Bayesian Nash equilibria of a voluntary contributions public goods game for two consumers with private information. The two consumers simultaneously make voluntary {{contributions to the}} public good, and the <b>contributions</b> are <b>refunded</b> if the total falls short {{of the cost of}} the public good. Several families of equilibria (step-function, regular and semi-regular) are studied. Necessary and sufficient conditions for regular and semi-regular equilibrium allocations to be interim incentive efficient are derived. In the uniform distribution case we prove (i) the existence of an open set of incentive efficient regular equilibria when the cost of production is large enough and (ii) the existence of an open set of incentive efficient semi-regular equilibria when the cost of production is low enough. Step-function equilibra are proved to be interim incentive inefficient...|$|R

The exception to the general rule of financing social insurance contributions of persons conducting non-agricultural economic activity by the insured persons themselves, entirely from their own funds, constitutes one of the instruments introduced by the law-maker to enhance vocational activation of disabled persons. However, the scope of requirements of technical and formal nature to be met by a person applying for the refund, {{as well as the}} assessment whether it was justified {{on the part of the}} law-maker to replace the mechanism of co-financing social insurance <b>contributions</b> with the <b>refund</b> of social insurance contributions leave room for doubt...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} private {{provision}} of discrete public good games with incomplete information and continuous contributions. To use the terminology of [Admati and Perry, Review of Economic Studies 58 (1991) 259], we consider contribution and subscription games. In the former, <b>contributions</b> are not <b>refunded</b> if {{the project is}} not completed, while in the latter they are. We show that the contribution game has only the strong free riding equilibria if cost is high enough. Thus, in this range of cost, the subscription game is superior to the contribution game. We present several interesting equilibria of both types of games and give a new proof of the ex-post inefficiency of the contribution and the subscription games. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Standard {{economic}} intuition {{would say}} that private provision of public goods will be inefficient due to free-rider problems. This view {{is in contrast to}} the results in the literature on full implementation where it is shown that (under certain conditions) games exist which only have efficient equilibria. The games usually used to demonstrate existence are quite complex and seem â€œunnaturalâ€ possibly leading to the perception that implementation requires a central authority to choose and impose the game. In a simple public goods setting, we show that a very natural gameâ€”similar to one often used elsewhere in the literature to model private provisionâ€”in fact fully implements the core of this economy in undominated perfect equilibria. More specifically, we consider a complete information economy with one private good and two possible social decisions. Agents voluntarily contribute any non-negative amount of the private good they choose and the social decision is to provide the public good iff contributions are sufficient to pay for it. The <b>contributions</b> are <b>refunded</b> otherwise. The set of undominated perfect equilibrium outcomes of this game is exactly the core of the economy. We give some extensions of this result, discuss the role of perfection and alternative equilibrium notions, and discuss the intuition and implications of the results...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{simultaneous}} discrete {{public good}} games with incomplete information and continuous contributions. To use the terminology of Admati and Perry (1991), we consider contribution and subscription games. In the former, <b>contributions</b> are not <b>refunded</b> if {{the project is}} not completed, while in the latter they are. We provide necessary conditions that increasing equilibria of contribution games and subscription games must satisfy for general distribution functions. We then characterize a symmetric equilibrium of the subscription game when valuations are uniformly distributed. Our analysis shows {{that there is a}} signi cant di erence between the equilibrium outcomes of the two games. In fact, we show that for the contribution game, zero " is the only equilibrium for a general family of distributions.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the Nash equilibria {{to a game}} where a discrete public good is to be provided. Each individual may participate by making a fixed contribution. If {{a sufficient number of}} contributions are made, the good is provided. Otherwise, the good is not provided. One variant of the rules allows for <b>contributions</b> to be <b>refunded</b> when the good is not provided. For pure strategies, we find that the Nash equilibria with a refund are a superset of those without a refund. For both rules, the efficient number of players contributing is an equilibrium. For mixed strategies, to every equilibrium without a refund there is a corresponding equilibrium with a refund with a higher number of expected contributors. Mixed strategy equilibria 'disappear' as the number of players grows large. Some results reported in the experimental literature are discussed in light of these theoretical results...|$|R

30|$|Interestingly, {{contributing}} to the same project indicates cooperation. On crowdfunding, the project does not receive funding until the contribution reaches the target amount. Thus, a project’s success depends on multitudinous lenders who voluntarily {{contributing to}}gether. If the project could not be fully funded, current <b>contributions</b> will be <b>refunded</b> and do not count toward team performance. A team member may consider lending to a project that the rival team has already lent to as cooperating with the rival team to achieve its goals. Members may then be reluctant to cooperate with a rival team (Kogut 1989; Evald and Bager 2008). Furthermore, as lenders more likely to contribute to borrowers with a shorter culture distance and close social resemblance to themselves (Burtch et al. 2014; Galak et al. 2011), members may infer from a rival team contribution that the project {{may not be a}} good match for their own team. Thus, we would expect that a team is less likely to contribute to a project that has received a contribution from its rival team.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} a simultaneous discrete public good provision game with incomplete information. To use the terminology of Admati and Perry (1991), we consider both contribution and subscription games. In the former, <b>contributions</b> are not <b>refunded</b> if {{the project is}} not completed, while in the latter they are. In the presence of complete information about individuals' valuations for the public good, {{the difference between the}} equilibrium outcomes of a subscription game and a contribution game is not significant. However, there is both casual evidence from the fund-raising literature and experimental evidence that subscription games are ``superior '', i. e., a refund increases the chance of providing the good given that it is efficient to do so. Our analysis shows that this is indeed the case in the presence of incomplete information. We compute a symmetric equilibrium for the subscription game and show that it is not necessarily efficient. This inefficiency stems from the difficulties arising in coordinating to overcome the free-rider problem in the presence of incomplete information. Although {{it is well known that}} informational disparities impose limits on the efficiency of outcomes, the novel feature of our analysis is to explicitly model the resulting trade-off [...] - when deciding how much to contribute towards the public good [...] - between increasing the likelihood of provision and creating incentives for free-riding by the other player. Moreover, we show that for the contribution game, ``contributing zero'' is the only equilibrium for a given range of the fixed cost of provision and for a family of distributions. public goods; incomplete information; continuous distribution...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} documents {{pension benefit}} choices made by {{public school teachers}} enrolled in the Illinois Teachers 2 ̆ 7 Retirement System (TRS), where they choose between taking a lump-sum withdrawal of their refundable contributions and deferring a pension benefit. The analysis explores {{the extent to which}} vested teachers enrolled in TRS separate from service with positive pension wealth, estimates how much money is 2 ̆ 2 left on the table 2 ̆ 2 at a conventional discount rate, and investigates what types of teachers display higher or lower discount rates as indicated by cashout patterns. To control for the relative attractiveness between choices, the analysis relies on three central measures: the pension-wealth-to-cash-out-ratio, net pension wealth, and the internal rate of return. Thirty-six percent of classroom teachers in TRS choose to withdraw their refundable contributions, and this estimate arguably provides a lower bound for similar 2 ̆ 2 final salary 2 ̆ 2 defined benefit pension plans in other states. Results from behavioral models find higher cashout rates among male, African American, and Hispanic teachers; teachers who work in rural districts; and teachers who did not receive a degree from an elite institution in Illinois. These results indicate higher discount rates among these groups. I find no evidence in the data of a relationship between subject endorsements and cashout decisions. Behavioral findings are consistent across models that assume different discount rates. The analysis concludes with an estimate of the aggregate leakage that occurs among TRS members who take a refund claim. Leakage is defined as NetPW for refund claimants who quit when the value of their pension wealth outweighs their refundable <b>contributions.</b> Leakage that <b>refund</b> claimants experience since 1980, adjusted for taxes and penalties, amount to 34, 120 per refund claimant among all members and 35, 229 per refund claimant among classroom teachers. Over four-fifths of this leakage, however, occurred since 2000. Annuitants incur about 9, 000 per member. Relative to the overall fiscal health of TRS, total leakage by members since 1980 as a percentage of pension debt is 0. 2 percent. The findings in this analysis suggest a set of policy implications, both for retirement security and for how some teachers value their retirement benefits...|$|R
