The so-called elementary Fowler-Nordheim-type equation, that appears in undergraduate textbook discussions of field emission, is obtained by putting λ'Z→1, PF→1, →1; this does not yield good quantitative predictions because it makes the barrier stronger {{than it is in}} physical reality. The so-called standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation, originally developed by Murphy and Good, and much used in past literature, is obtained by putting λ'Z→tF−2, PF→1, →vF, where vF is v(f), where f is the value of f'h obtained by putting h=φ, and tF is a related parameter (of value <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>unity).</b>|$|E

2500|$|Note that in {{contrast}} to optical light, the real part of the refractive index is less than but <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>unity,</b> this is [...] "due {{to the fact that}} the X-ray spectrum generally lies to the high-frequency side of various resonances associated with the binding of electrons". The phase velocity inside of the object is larger than the velocity of light c.

2500|$|Ordinary {{transformers}} {{are designed}} to be [...] "tightly coupled". Due to the iron core and close proximity of the windings, they have a high mutual inductance (M), the coupling coefficient is <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>unity</b> 0.95 - 1.0, which means almost all the magnetic field of the primary winding passes through the secondary. The Tesla transformer in contrast is [...] "loosely coupled", the primary winding is larger in diameter and spaced apart from the secondary, so the mutual inductance is lower and the coupling coefficient is only 0.05 to 0.2. This means that only 5% to 20% of the magnetic field of the primary coil passes through the secondary when it is open circuited. The loose coupling slows the exchange of energy between the primary and secondary coils, which allows the oscillating energy to stay in the secondary circuit longer before it returns to the primary and begins dissipating in the spark.|$|E

Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling.|$|R
