5|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of chromosomes of Azotobacter vinelandii, strain AvOP, is partially determined. This chromosome is a circular DNA molecule which contains 5,342,073 nucleotide pairs and 5,043 genes, of which 4,988 encode proteins. The fraction of guanine + cytosine pairs is 65 mole percent. The number of chromosomes in the cells and the DNA content increases upon aging, {{and in the}} stationary growth phase, cultures may contain more than 100 copies of a chromosome per cell. The original DNA content (one copy) is restored when replanting the culture into a fresh medium. In addition to <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA,</b> Azotobacter can contain plasmids.|$|E

25|$|Eukaryotic DNA {{replication}} is a conserved {{mechanism that}} restricts DNA replication to only once per cell cycle. Eukaryotic DNA replication of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA</b> is central for the duplication {{of a cell}} and {{is necessary for the}} maintenance of the eukaryotic genome.|$|E
40|$|Plasmid pHF 360 was {{constructed}} from cloned rRNA genes (rDNA) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{and used as}} hybridization probe for the Pseudomonas fluorescens group. The probe was tested by dot and in situ colony hybridizations to <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNAs</b> {{from a wide variety}} of organisms. pHF 360 DNA hybridized exclusively to <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNAs</b> from bacteria representing the P. fluorescens group and separated them clearly from all other bacteria tested in the present study. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA showed that it is a fragment from a 23 S rRNA gene of P. aeruginosa. It was compared with the published 23 S RNA sequence from Escherichia coli...|$|R

25|$|The {{eukaryotic}} DNA {{is organized}} {{in one or}} more linear molecules, called chromosomes, which are associated with histone proteins. All <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA</b> is stored in the cell nucleus, separated from the cytoplasm by a membrane. Some eukaryotic organelles such as mitochondria also contain some DNA.|$|E
25|$|Leon Kull and Kevin Alan Brook led {{the first}} {{scientific}} study of Crimean Karaites using genetic testing of both Y <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA</b> and mitochondrial DNA and {{the results showed that}} Crimean Karaites are indeed partially of Middle Eastern origin and related to the descendants of rabbinic Jews.|$|E
25|$|Unlike eukaryotes, the {{bacterial}} DNA is not enclosed {{inside of}} a membrane-bound nucleus but instead resides inside the bacterial cytoplasm. This means that the transfer of cellular information through the processes of translation, transcription and DNA replication all occur within the same compartment and can interact with other cytoplasmic structures, most notably ribosomes. The bacterial DNA is not packaged using histones to form chromatin as in eukaryotes but instead exists as a highly compact supercoiled structure, the precise nature of which remains unclear. Most bacterial chromosomes are circular although some examples of linear DNA exist (e.g. Borrelia burgdorferi). Along with <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA,</b> most bacteria also contain small independent pieces of DNA called plasmids that often encode for traits that are advantageous but not essential to their bacterial host. Plasmids can be easily gained or lost by a bacterium and can be transferred between bacteria {{as a form of}} horizontal gene transfer. So plasmids can be described as an extra <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA</b> in a bacterial cell.|$|E
40|$|Digestion {{patterns}} of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNAs</b> of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus weihenstephanensis strains suggest that Sau 3 AI-type restriction modification systems are widely present among the isolates tested.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{next-generation}} sequencing (NGS) systems and the associated high throughput they afford, the input to these machines requires manageable lengths of fragments (similar to 1000 bp) produced from <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Therefore, {{it is critical to}} develop devices that can shear DNA in a controlled fashion. We report a polymer-based microfluidic device that establishes an efficient and inexpensive platform with performance comparable to a commercially available bench-top system. close 3...|$|R
25|$|Cell {{division}} cycle 45 (Cdc45) {{protein is}} a critical component for {{the conversion of the}} pre-replicative complex to the initiation complex. The Cdc45 protein assembles at replication origins before initiation and is required for replication to begin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and has an essential role during elongation. Thus, Cdc45 has central roles in both initiation and elongation phases of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA</b> replication.|$|E
25|$|In Iran {{outliers}} in the Y-chromosomes and Mitochondrial DNA {{gene pool}} are consisted {{by the north}} Iranian ethnicities, such as the Gilaki's and Mazandarani's, who's genetic build up including <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA</b> are nearly identical to the major South Caucasian ethnicites, namely the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijani's. Other outliers are made by the Baloch people, representing a mere 1-2% of the total Iranian population, who have more patrilinial and mitochondrial DNA lines leaning towards northwest South Asian ethnic groups.|$|E
25|$|In total, the {{mitochondrion}} hosts about 3000 {{different types}} of proteins, but only about 13 of them are coded on the mitochondrial DNA. Most of the 3000 types of proteins {{are involved in a}} variety of processes other than ATP production, such as porphyrin synthesis. Only about 3% of them code for ATP production proteins. This means most of the genetic information coding for the protein makeup of mitochondria is in <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA</b> and is involved in processes other than ATP synthesis. This increases the chances that a mutation that will affect a mitochondrion will occur in <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA,</b> which is inherited in a Mendelian pattern. Another result is that a chromosomal mutation will affect a specific tissue due to its specific needs, whether those may be high energy requirements or a need for the catabolism or anabolism of a specific neurotransmitter or nucleic acid. Because several copies of the mitochondrial genome are carried by each mitochondrion (2–10 in humans), mitochondrial mutations can be inherited maternally by mtDNA mutations which are present in mitochondria inside the oocyte before fertilization, or (as stated above) through mutations in the chromosomes.|$|E
40|$|The {{lysogenization}} of Streptomyces parvulus by actinophage R 4 occurs by site-specific {{integration of}} the phage genome into the chromosome. The DNA fragments containing the attachment sites on the host chromosome, the phage genome, and the two junctions created by insertion of the phage genome were cloned and sequenced. The attachment sites were found to share a common core of 12 bp. This common core sequence was not detected in <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNAs</b> of S. coelicolor and S. lividans...|$|R

25|$|In a 2008 {{study by}} Castillo, et al., <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA</b> was ioslated using the Marmur methods of simple cell {{disruption}} by detergent lysis, nucleic extraction by an organic solvent, and DNA recovery by ethanol precipitation were used. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence of H. larsenii was studied using ARB software. The neighbor-joining method {{was used to}} conduct 16s rRNA gene sequence analysis and determine phylogenetic relationships. The closest neighboring species Natrialba aegypitaca and Natrialba asiatica had a 94.5% and 93.3% genome similarity, respectively. The key difference from Natrialba is that H. larsenii lacks the key bases 403G and 560G.|$|E
25|$|A. tumefaciens infects {{the plant}} through its Ti plasmid. The Ti plasmid {{integrates}} {{a segment of}} its DNA, known as T-DNA, into the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA</b> of its host plant cells. A. tumefaciens has flagella that allow it to swim through the soil towards photoassimilates that accumulate in the rhizosphere around roots. Some strains may chemotactically move towards chemical exudates from plants, such as acetosyringone and sugars. The former is recognised by the VirA protein, a transmembrane protein encoded in the virA gene on the Ti plasmid. Sugars are recognised by the chvE protein, a chromosomal gene-encoded protein located in the periplasmic space.|$|E
25|$|In April 2015, Swedish {{scientists}} {{published the}} complete genome (complete <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences) of the woolly mammoth, and now separate projects {{are working on}} gradually adding mammoth DNA sequences to elephant cells. For example, a Harvard University team is already attempting to study the animals' characteristics in vitro by inserting some specific mammoth genes into Asian elephant stem cells. By March 2015, some woolly mammoth genes had been copied into the genome of an Asian elephant, using the new CRISPR DNA editing technique. Genetic segments from frozen mammoth specimens, including genes for the ears, subcutaneous fat, and hair attributes, were copied into the DNA of skin cells from a modern elephant.|$|E

The cryotolerant and non-cryotolerant strains gave distinctly different electrophoretic profiles. The hybrids cryotolerant x cryotolerant and non-cryotolerant x non-cryotolerant were fertile and they gave the same electrophoretic karyotype as the respective parents. The cryotolerant x non-cryotolerant hybrids were sterile and gave electrophoretic karyotypes which showed both the bands the parents have in common and those they do not share...|$|R

Many uropathogens lack a deletion and an insertion characteristic of enterohemorrhagic strains. At the same chromosomal position, they harbor a 2. 1 -kb insertion of unknown origin with a base composition suggestive of horizontal gene transfer. Unlike virulence determinants associated with urinary tract infection and/or neonatal meningitis (pap or prs, sfa, kps, and hly), the 2. 1 -kb insertion is shared by all group B 2 strains of the E. coli Reference Collection...|$|R

Detection of telomerase activity in renal cell carcinomas {{may be a}} key to understanding the loss of growth control in tumor cells. This enzyme forms the end of most <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNAs</b> (that is, telomeres) found in renal tumors. When activated, the telomeres shorten with every cell cycle {{and then there is}} a compensatory lengthening of the cells, which then proliferate and eventually become immortal and metastasize.

25|$|Epigenetics is {{the study}} of the {{regulation}} of gene expression through chemical, non-mutational changes in DNA structure. The theory of epigenetics in cancer pathogenesis is that non-mutational changes to DNA can lead to alterations in gene expression. Normally, oncogenes are silent, for example, because of DNA methylation. Loss of that methylation can induce the aberrant expression of oncogenes, leading to cancer pathogenesis. Known mechanisms of epigenetic change include DNA methylation, and methylation or acetylation of histone proteins bound to <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA</b> at specific locations. Classes of medications, known as HDAC inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, can re-regulate the epigenetic signaling in the cancer cell.|$|E
25|$|Free {{testosterone}} (T) is transported {{into the}} cytoplasm of target tissue cells, {{where it can}} bind to the androgen receptor, or {{can be reduced to}} 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5α-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than testosterone, so that its androgenic potency is about 5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA.</b> The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects.|$|E

50|$|The protein Caspase DNase is an {{endonuclease}} {{involved in}} the cell apoptotic process that facilitates the DNA breakup. Cell apoptotic death is a process executed by cysteine proteases that allows the animals to keep their homeostasis, also regulated by other mechanisms such as the growth and cell differentiation. This biological response {{is characterized by the}} <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA’s</b> degradation in tiny fragments within the nucleus of the cell. After many investigations and research, it was possible to ensure that Caspase-activated DNase is the main responsible of this destruction due to a long list of stimuli.|$|R

500|$|The {{bacterial}} cell cycle {{is divided into}} three stages. [...] The B period occurs between the completion of cell division and the beginning of DNA replication. [...] The C period encompasses {{the time it takes to}} replicate the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA.</b> [...] The D period refers to the stage between the conclusion of DNA replication and the end of cell division. [...] The doubling rate of E. coli is higher when more nutrients are available. [...] However, the length of the C and D periods do not change, even when the doubling time becomes less than the sum of the C and D periods. [...] At the fastest growth rates, replication begins before the previous round of replication has completed, resulting in multiple replication forks along the DNA and overlapping cell cycles.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, {{researchers}} {{assembled a}} complete mitochondrial genome {{profile of the}} woolly mammoth, which allowed them to trace the close evolutionary relationship between mammoths and Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). A 2015 DNA review confirmed Asian elephants as the closest living relative of the woolly mammoth. African elephants (Loxodonta africana) branched away from this clade around 6 million years ago, close {{to the time of}} the similar split between chimpanzees and humans. Before the publication of the Neanderthal genome, many researchers expected the first fully sequenced nuclear genome of an extinct species would be that of the mammoth. A 2010 study confirmed these relationships, and suggested the mammoth and Asian elephant lineages diverged 5.8–7.8 million years ago, while African elephants diverged from an earlier common ancestor 6.6–8.8 million years ago. In 2008, much of the woolly mammoth's <b>chromosomal</b> <b>DNA</b> was mapped. The analysis showed that the woolly mammoth and the African elephant are 98.55% to 99.40% identical. The team mapped the woolly mammoth's nuclear genome sequence by extracting DNA from the hair follicles of both a 20,000-year-old mammoth retrieved from permafrost, and another that died 60,000 years ago. In 2012, proteins were confidently identified for the first time, collected from a 43,000-year-old woolly mammoth.|$|E
2500|$|Apoptosis (from Ancient Greek ἀπόπτωσις [...] "falling off") is {{a process}} of {{programmed}} cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms.
