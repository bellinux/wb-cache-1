40|$|The {{investigation}} {{of the collapse of}} “ 7 World Trade” as part of the events of 11 September 2001 in New York City (Gann, 2008) indicated that connections were among the most vulnerable elements of steel-framed or composite buildings, and their characteristics can determine whether such buildings survive in extreme scenarios such as fire. In this case total collapse of the building was triggered by the fracture of beam-to-column connections caused largely by thermal expansion of long-span beams. This emphasized the importance of investigating the complex mechanisms through which forces are transferred from the adjacent parts of a structure to the connections under fire conditions. The Cardington fire tests in 1995 - 96 (Newman, 2000) provided ample evidence that both shear buckling of beam webs and beam bottom-flange buckling, near to the ends of steel beams, are very prevalent under fire conditions. Both of these phenomena could affect the force distribution at the adjacent column-face <b>connection</b> <b>bolt</b> rows, and therefore the sequence of fracture of components. However, there is a distinct lack of practical research investigating the post-buckling behaviour of beams of Classes 1 and 2 sections adjacent to connections at elevated temperatures. In this PhD thesis, the development of analytical models of pure beam-web shear buckling and a combination of both beam-web shear buckling and bottom-flange buckling of beams of Classes 1 and 2 sections are reported. The analytical models are able to predict the post-buckling behaviour of the beam-end buckling panels in the vicinity of beam-column connections at elevated temperatures. A transition criterion, to distinguish between cases in which pure beam-web shear buckling occurs and those in which the instability is a combination of shear buckling and bottom-flange buckling, has been proposed, including a calculation procedure to detect the transition length between these two buckling modes. A component-based buckling element has been created and implemented in the three-dimensional structural fire analysis software Vulcan. The influence of the buckling elements on the bolt row force redistribution of the adjacent connections has been investigated in isolated beams and a simple two-span two-floor frame. It is expected that the buckling element will be involved in more complex performance-based frame analysis for design, and that it will be used with an explicit dynamic procedure to simulate local and progressive collapse of whole buildings. ...|$|E

The current design rules on <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> of cold-formed stainless steel are mainly based on those of carbon steel, and are applicable for room (ambient) temperature condition only. These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperatures. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> of cold-formed stainless steel structures at elevated temperatures. The key {{findings of the investigation}} are described in the following paragraphs. A total of 25 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration of three different grades of stainless steel at elevated temperatures. The stainless steels are austenitic stainless steel EN 1. 4301 (AISI 304) and EN 1. 4571 (AISI 316 Ti having small amount of titanium) as well as lean duplex stainless steel EN 1. 4162 (AISI S 32101). Totally 434 tests on <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> of stainless steel were performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 950 ºC using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the nominal strengths calculated from the American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and European codes for stainless steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the material properties at elevated temperatures were used in the design equations for room temperature. It is shown that the nominal strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. A total of 78 cold-formed stainless steel single shear and double shear <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> were tested in post-fire condition. The test results were compared with those tested at room temperature. Generally, it is found that the <b>bolted</b> <b>connection</b> strengths in post-fire condition cooling down from 350 and 650 ºC are higher than those tested at room temperature for all three grades of stainless steel. Finite element models for single shear and double shear <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> were developed and verified against the experimental results. Static analysis technique was used in the numerical analyses. Extensive parametric studies that included 450 specimens were performed using the verified finite element models to evaluate the bearing resistances of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> of stainless steel at elevated temperatures. Design equations for bearing resistances of cold-formed stainless steel single shear and double shear <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> were proposed based on both the experimental and numerical results in the temperature ranged from 22 to 950 ºC. The bearing resistances of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> obtained from the tests and the finite element analyses were compared with the nominal strengths calculated using the current design rules and also compared with the predicted strengths calculated using the proposed design equations.

The book provides advanced students, researchers al professionals in civil and structural engineering with the basic principles upon which the modern codes are based. In the first part, the materials, the actions and the sectional behavior are analyzed on the base of the limit state theory. Then the <b>connections</b> (<b>bolted</b> and welded) and the stability effects are examined. In this way is possible speak about seismic performance, retrofitting an refurbishment of existing buildings, referring to the italian rules, to the european codes EC 3, EC 4 and to the AISC rules...|$|R
40|$|The general {{bearing mode}} of failure often {{controls}} the capacity of cold-formed steel <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> loaded in shear. Previous {{research has shown that}} the absence of washers can significantly lower the bearing resistance of these connections. Experimental studies have also revealed that the bearing capacity can be formulated with a gradated bearing coefficient that is governed by the ratio of fastener diameter to sheet thickness. A gradated bearing coefficient method, which was based on an investigation of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> composed of mild steel as well as thin high strength steel, has recently been proposed to cold-formed steel design code committees in North America, Australia and New Zealand. However, the new bearing method does not include provisions for the design of washerless <b>bolted</b> <b>connections.</b> For this reason a total of 168 <b>bolted</b> <b>connection</b> shear tests designed to fail by bearing were performed. The test program included connections with and without washers, which were divided into single and double shear, as well as high strength steel (Grade 550) and mild sheet steel (Grade 230) categories. The thickness of the sheet steel material ranged between 0. 43 mm and 1. 53 mm. In addition, data for 381 washerless <b>bolted</b> <b>connection</b> specimens from previous experimental investigations was included in an evaluation of current cold-formed steel design standards and specifications. Modifications to the connection design procedure contained in the 2001 North American Specification were proposed...|$|R
