5|$|On lap 28, Kimi Räikkönen was {{the first}} of the top runners to pit, coming out in fourth, but spun at the hairpin in a repeat of an {{incident}} from 2014. The incident cost him twelve seconds and allowed Valtteri Bottas to stay ahead of him in third after he made a pit stop on lap 30. Hamilton made a pit stop on the same lap with Rosberg following suit two laps later, both without incident. At this point, Rosberg was about 1.5 seconds behind his teammate. Another four laps later, Sebastian Vettel <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> his second and final stop of the race. Massa <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> his only stop on lap 38, putting on the super-soft tyres, and dropped from sixth to ninth. Räikkönen made a pit stop again on lap 42, staying in fourth position ahead of the Lotus of Romain Grosjean.|$|E
5|$|On lap 48, Michele Alboreto <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a pit stop, {{but as he}} left, the rear-right wheel came {{loose from}} the Minardi as it left the pit lane, {{striking}} two Ferrari and two Lotus mechanics, who were left needing hospital treatment.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{has so far}} come in {{for major}} criticism, with the original title's aerial and ground-based gameplay being seen as repetitive and dull, although some reviewers found it entertaining. Drakengard 2 also <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> such criticism, although minor improvements were cited. In contrast, the gameplay of Drakengard 3 was generally praised or seen as an improvement upon the previous two entries, though the dragon-riding segments <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> criticisms for difficult controls. Opinions were divided on Niers unconventional mix of gameplay styles from multiple game genres, with some praising the variety and others seeing it as poorly executed. The series {{as a whole has}} gained a cult following in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The press {{themselves}} <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> {{some criticism}} in this respect, {{with the group}} Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting complaining that the Times and other media outlets focused {{on the effect of}} Nannygate on white, upper-middle-class women, and excluded the perspective of the actual immigrant childcare workers.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the poor {{economic}} conditions, Eurostar received state aid in May 2009 to cancel out some of the accumulated debt from the High Speed 1 construction programme. Later that year, during snowy conditions in the run-up to Christmas, thousands of passengers were left stranded as several trains broke down and many more were cancelled. In an independent review commissioned by Eurostar, the company <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> serious criticism about its handling of the incident and lack of plans for such a scenario.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the game}} has been positive. The average score in Metacritic is of 82 out of 100. The Japanese video game magazine Famitsu gave it a score of 36/40, earning the magazine's Platinum award and becoming the highest-ranking review score that week. The reviewers were generally positive about their experience: despite some comments about a lack of polish in environments, the game's character design, aesthetics, gameplay and story all <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> general praise, with multiple reviewers calling it a worthy part of the Megami Tensei series.|$|E
5|$|On lap 13, Felipe Massa passed Marcus Ericsson for ninth {{place and}} one lap later, Hamilton capitalised on a mistake by Vettel and overtook him to retake second {{position}}. Vettel lost another position when he let Räikkönen pass him on lap 16, the two being on different strategies. Meanwhile, Rosberg {{had built up}} a lead of around six seconds to Hamilton. On lap 19, Carlos Sainz Jr. allowed teammate Max Verstappen to pass him, while Alonso <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> what was his third pit stop of the race, leaving him in last position. Two laps later, Verstappen created flatspots on his tyres when he locked up his brakes, forcing him to pit. He emerged in 15th position. Vettel <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> his first pit stop on lap 24, coming out in sixth place ahead of compatriot Nico Hülkenberg. At the same time, Hamilton started to reduce the gap to Rosberg in front, cutting it down to less than two seconds by lap 29. With his teammate closing in, Rosberg made pit stops on lap 32, with Räikkönen following suit, whose pit stop was delayed, losing him around four seconds. Sergio Pérez was starting {{to close the gap}} to both Ferrari drivers in front of him after pitting early. Vettel reacted on lap 41 and changed to the super-soft tyres, coming out behind both Pérez and Ricciardo in sixth. One lap later, Hamilton <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> his second and final stop, having asked his team before if {{it would be possible to}} finish the race without stopping again. He emerged twelve seconds behind Rosberg and started to cut into his advantage immediately.|$|E

She also played in the final ten minutes of the {{semifinal}} match against Canada on August 6, a 4–3 win for the United States that sent them to the final. Sauerbrunn came in during the 80th minute of the match against Japan on August 9. The United States won the match 2–1, taking away the gold medal. In her three appearances in the tournament, Sauerbrunn played a total of 38 minutes. Following the Olympics, Sauerbrunn joined the national team on the Fan Tribute Tour.|$|E
5|$|The Golden Tornado was {{the clear}} favorite. Georgia Tech outplayed Vanderbilt {{and had the}} ball for three-fourths of the game. Several of Vanderbilt's players left with injuries. Its ends were easily skirted by the Tech backs Buck Flowers, Red Barron, and Frank Ferst. Tech's first {{touchdown}} came when Barron ripped off a 55-yard run. Captain Flowers once made a drop kick from 44 yards out. Ferst <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> Flowers {{in the middle of}} the second quarter when Georgia Tech started to use substitutes.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{headed to}} Headingley for the Fourth Test with Barnes still unfit. Australia made two {{changes for the}} Test. Middle-order batsman Neil Harvey <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> Barnes, while Ron Saggers {{replaced}} Don Tallonwho had a finger injurybehind the stumps. Brown was not recalled to open with Morris; instead, Hassett was promoted from the middle-order to open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order. Australia thus jettisoned the experiment of opening the batting with Johnson, who had managed only one and six in the previous Test.|$|E

5|$|The teams {{headed to}} Headingley for the Fourth Test, with Barnes still unfit. Australia made two {{changes for the}} match. Neil Harvey <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> Barnes, while Ron Saggers {{replaced}} Don Tallon—who had a finger injury—behind the stumps. Wisden commented that the England batsmen welcomed the freedom brought {{by the absence of}} Barnes from the forward short leg position. Brown was not recalled to open; instead, Hassett was promoted {{to the top of the}} order to partner Morris, while the teenager Harvey slotted into the middle-order. Hassett struggled, making 13 and 17, but Australia nevertheless completed a world record Test run-chase of 3/404 to seal the series with a seven-wicket win.|$|E
5|$|USMC Col. Al Gray {{suggested}} a covert, land-based rescue operation. and Lt. Col. Andy Anderson, Commander of the Joint Personnel Recovery Center (JPRC, MACVSOG-80) ordered a ground rescue. In Saigon, Navy SEAL Lt. Thomas R. Norris, {{one of just}} three SEAL officers and nine enlisted men remaining in Vietnam, had just completed an assignment in the Mekong Delta. He was waiting for orders when the call <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a commando operation to get Hambleton out. Norris was immediately dispatched to lead an operation to rescue Hambleton. He recruited five Vietnamese Sea Commando frogmen from the Lien Doc Nguoi Nhia (LDNN), Naval Advisory Detachment (NAD) in Da Nang.|$|E
5|$|Wrexham's squad {{included}} three Welsh internationals, Mickey Thomas, Gordon Davies and substitute Joey Jones. The first eleven was mostly composed of youth graduates, aged 20 years or under.

5|$|After the Battle of Chunuk Bair, {{while his}} bravery was not questioned, Malone {{initially}} <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> {{criticism of his}} handling of the defences, particularly the placement of his defence trenches. In the planning for the battle, and earlier in the Gallipoli Campaign, he had clashed with Major Arthur Temperley, Johnston's brigade major. Temperley, a British Army officer like Johnston, was one of the foremost critics of Malone's defensive arrangements and may have unduly influenced the subsequent official reports on the battle. However, recent studies have demonstrated that this criticism was misplaced and {{there were a number of}} crucial failures higher up in the chain of command. In particular, Johnston's delay in getting reinforcements to Chunuk Bair once it was captured likely led to the failure to hold the gains made by Malone's battalion.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{suitability}} {{once again}} <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> discussion during the war. Ansons and Boulton Paul Defiants were {{not suitable for}} ASR operations. The Vickers Warwick was earmarked for the main ASR aircraft. Four 20-aircraft squadrons with specialised ASR conversion were to be made available by the spring, 1943. While development was slow. Nevertheless, the effort paid off. In May 1943, 156 men of Bomber Command were rescued from the sea by No. 279 Squadron alone. By the end of 1943 Coastal Command had rescued 1,684 aircrew out of 5,466 presumed to have ditched in the sea. On D-Day, 6 June 1944, 163 aircrew and 60 other personnel were rescued. During the month, June 1944, 355 were saved by ASR units of Coastal Command. In all, 10,663 persons were rescued by Coastal Command in ASR operations. Of this total, 5,721 were Allied aircrew, 277 enemy aircrew, and 4,665 non-aircrew.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rift}} between {{the players and}} Brown and between Modell and Brown grew, Modell fired Brown on January 7, 1963. A {{controversy}} developed over {{the timing of the}} decision amid a local newspaper strike, which limited discussion of the move. A printing company executive, however, got together a group of sportswriters and published a 32-page magazine fielding players' views on the firing. Opinions were mixed; Modell <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> his share of criticism, but tackle and team captain Mike McCormack said he did not think the team could win under Brown. Blanton Collier, Brown's longtime assistant, was named the team's new head coach, and Brown began to plan his next move as he continued to receive an $82,500 salary under his eight-year contract.|$|E
