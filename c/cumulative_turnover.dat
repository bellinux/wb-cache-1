30|$|The National Development and Reform Commission {{issued a}} “Notice on {{starting}} the national carbon emission trading market” {{and pointed out}} that it would start the national carbon emission trading market and ensure its implementation of carbon emission trading system in 2017. China’s pilot carbon emission trading programs began operating {{in the second half}} of 2013 in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, Hubei, Guangdong and Shenzhen (Zeng et al. 2017) The carbon emission trading schemes in 7 regions in China marked a watershed in the history of Chinese climate policy (Ren and Lo 2017; Tan and Wang 2017). At the end of 2015, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>turnover</b> in seven pilot carbon trading markets was nearly 80 million tons and the cumulative payment was more than 2.5 billion RMB (Zhou et al. 2016). These pilot experiences laid a good foundation for the establishment of China’s carbon emission trading market. Compared to the international emissions trading market, China’s is currently in its initial stage and has some significant problems including unreasonable carbon price and imperfect carbon emission trading mechanisms (Zeng et al. 2017). Therefore, a study of the carbon trading market has become necessary. How to rationalize the pricing of various products in the carbon market is the key to the normal operation of the whole market. It is important to study the factors influencing carbon price in China’s carbon trading pilot and promote the rational pricing of China’s carbon trading schemes.|$|E

The typical 'volume event study' employs a single-index market model borrowed mutatis mutandis from abnormal returns event studies. In this article, several alternative event study test statistics are compared using Brown and Warner (1985) style simulations, i. e. random samples of securities are drawn from the data set provided by the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and the empirical distributions of alternative test statistics are compared. In contrast to the extant literature, these simulations show that estimated generalized least squares with first- and second-order autoregressive structures do not offer material improvement over ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. A first-order moving average structure also does not offer material improvement. These simulations also show that test statistics that are robust with regard to cross-sectional heteroskedasticity are essential for testing the hypothesis that the cross-sectional mean <b>cumulative</b> abnormal log <b>turnover</b> is zero. ...|$|R
40|$|Impact of {{different}} modalities of continuous venovenous hemofiltration on sepsis-induced alterations in experimental pancreatitis. BackgroundContinuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) {{is assumed to}} attenuate systemic complications in septic diseases. The impact {{of different}} treatment intensities of CVVH on immunologic and systemic alterations in experimental pancreatitis was evaluated. MethodsEighty-four minipigs were allocated either to an untreated control group (group 1) or to one of six treatment groups (groups 2 to 7) that underwent CVVH in different modalities: (1) : “late” CVVH, started after a decline of total peripheral resistance of 30 % versus “prophylactic” CVVH started immediately after the induction of pancreatitis; (2) no change of hemofilters versus a periodic change of filters every 12 hours; (3) low-volume CVVH with a filtrate turnover of 20 mL/kg body weight (BW) /h versus high-volume CVVH (100 mL/kg/h). Pancreatitis was induced by intraductal injection of sodium-taurocholate (3 %, 1 mL/kg BW) and enterokinase (2 U/kg BW). We focused on the occurrence of sepsis, serum cytokines, down-regulation of major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) and the endotoxin receptor CD 14 expression, bacterial translocation/endotoxemia, and pulmonary and renal histologic alterations. ResultsCVVH delayed or definitively prevented the occurrence of sepsis. Pancreatitis {{was associated with a}} tremendous initial tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) response prior to a return to near baseline levels in the late course of sepsis. Endotoxin hyporesponsiveness, suggested by the dissociation of decreasing TNF-α levels and increasing endotoxemia in end-stage sepsis, was favorably influenced by CVVH. Down-regulation of MHC II and CD 14 expression was prevented in non-septic animals. CVVH-related sepsis-protection led to a significant attenuation of histological injury in lungs and kidneys. “Prophylactic” CVVH prevented histological changes more effectively than “late” CVVH. ConclusionsCVVH offers a therapeutic option for supportive treatment in severe pancreatitis. The efficiency of CVVH is associated with the duration of filter use and <b>cumulative</b> plasma <b>turnover.</b> Since CVVH may lead to sepsis-protection and long-term survival, further evaluation in controlled, clinical trials is warranted...|$|R

This research examined the volumes traded in shares listed on the JSE All Share index, to determine if it could be used as an indicator of insider trading, and whether it increases significantly in the days immediately preceding SENS announcements. The top five abnormal returns per share were generated using control portfolios. These were analysed manually to identify the most appropriate SENS announcement. From the 735 abnormal returns, 142 announcements qualified for the volume analysis, after the removal of confounding events. These announcements were classified into seven categories: BEE and governance; financial structure; investment/disinvestment; key personnel; mergers and acquisitions; trading update; and other. The average daily <b>cumulative</b> abnormal volume <b>turnover</b> (ACAVT) was examined using a 21 -day event window period preannouncement. The preceding 63 days were used to calculate the benchmark. Three techniques were used to calculate ACAVTs – equations, t-tests and bootstrapping - which proved successful in determining ACAVT. The tests showed that overall the ACAVT was statistically insignificant. Two categories exhibited significant ACAVT – BEE and governance, and key personnel.

40|$|The recycle of {{homogeneous}} Heck catalysts from post-reaction mixtures using solvent resistant nanofiltration (SRNF) membranes {{is known}} to increase catalytic productivity. However, the technique is sensitive to catalyst stability when applied to conventional catalysts: catalyst deactivation will cause declining reaction rates and higher reactor occupancy with {{an increasing number of}} catalyst recycles. In this study, a conventional Heck catalyst {bis(acetato) bis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(II) }, was recycled six times, before the reaction rate dropped below 20 % of the original value. A <b>cumulative</b> <b>turnover</b> number (TON) of 690 in 120 h was obtained, whilst providing a product substantially lowered in organometallic impurities. Significant improvements in system performance were realised by employing, at identical Pd loading, state-of-the-art catalysts with greater chemical stability. An imidazolylidene catalyst, bis(1, 3 -dibenzylimidazoline- 2 -ylidene) diiodopalladium(II), yielded an equal TON for six recycles in 40 h with substantially less reaction rate decline. Palladium(II) acetate stabilised by the quaternary phosphonium salt (quat) tetraphenylphosphonium bromide even gave six recycles in under 30 h after careful solvent selection. In all cases, the membrane showed good selectivity against the catalyst (up to 96 % Pd rejection), while allowing the reaction product to permeate completely. Through the sustainable high reaction rates, reactor occupancy can be minimised, and waste generated by downstream processing reduced. Indeed, the imidazolylidene and the quat-stabilised catalyst systems surpassed 10 catalyst recycles with TONs > 1000 within 60 and 45 h, respectively. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} {{co-operative}} livestock marts revealed that <b>cumulative</b> marts <b>turnover</b> decreased by 26 % from 1990 to 1999 : Commission income {{as a percentage}} of turnover increased from 2 % in 1990 to 3. 2 % in 1999. However operating expenses increased by 25 % from 1990 to 1999. Operating expenses have since 1997, surpassed commision income, thus putting co-op marts in a collective loss making situation from their mart activities. However overall profit from co-op mart societies (including profit generated from all business activities) almost doubled between 1990 and 1999. While overall profitability of livestock marts societies has increased, twelve of thirty nine marts were in a loss making situation in 1999. Four of these marts have been in a permanent loss - making situation since 1990. All loss making societies in 1999 have little or no involvement in non-mart activities and almost all operate from just one site. In general, the large diversified societies are showing profitability. A number of strategic alternatives to deal with their situation were placed before mart executives. A diversification strategy {{is by far the most}} likely strategy to be adopted by marts for the future Most marts are unlikely to consider merging with other societies. Most marts have no plans to downsize and exit from the industry is not considered an option by any society. There is a recognition that there is an urgent need to rationalise the industry, but this strategy is likely to meet with a strong resistance from marts. A problem with rationalisation is that there are no incentives to make this strategy a reality. On the one hand, management would be reluctant to follow this approach, as it may be perceived to reflect badly on their own performance or may result in them being forced to seek alternative employment. On the other hand, the shareholders have little to gain and much to lose if the mart closes. Projections of past trends and impact of new policies would suggest continuing decline in turnover and profitability in the co-operative mart sector. Rationalisation is therefore absolutely essential. The industry cannot sustain the present number of marts. Diversification seems the most obvious option for the future of the industry. In general marts that have diversified are profitable and there is no reason why this trend cannot continue into the future. End of Project Repor...|$|R

(HRI) pilot plant facilities in Golden, CO. FBSR products from these pilot tests on simulated waste representative of the SBW at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC) were subsequently transferred to the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) for characterization and leach testing. Four as-received Denitration and Mineralization Reformer (DMR) granular/powder samples and four High Temperature Filter (HTF) powder samples were received by SRNL. FBSR DMR samples {{had been taken from}} the ''active'' bed, while the HTF samples were the fines collected as carryover from the DMR. The process operated at high fluidizing velocities during the mineralization test such that nearly all of the product collected was from the HTF. Active bed samples were collected from the DMR to monitor bed particle size distribution. Characterization of these crystalline powder samples shows that they are primarily Al, Na and Si, with > 1 wt% Ca, Fe and K. The DMR samples contained less than 1 wt% carbon and the HTF samples ranged from 13 to 26 wt% carbon. X-ray diffraction analyses show that the DMR samples contained significant quantities of the Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } startup bed. The DMR samples became progressively lower in starting bed alumina with major Na/Al/Si crystalline phases (nepheline and sodium aluminosilicate) present as <b>cumulative</b> bed <b>turnover</b> occurred but 100 % bed turnover was not achieved. The HTF samples also contained these major crystalline phases. Durability testing of the DMR and HTF samples using the ASTM C 1285 Product Consistency Test (PCT) 7 -day leach test at 90 C was performed along with several reference glass samples. Comparison of the normalized leach rates for the various DMR and HTF components was made with the reference glasses and the Low Activity Waste (LAW) specification for the Hanford Waste Treatment and Vitrification Plant (WTP). Normalized releases from the DMR and HTF samples were all less than 1 g/m{sup 2 }. For comparison, normalized release from the High-Level Waste (HLW) benchmark Environmental Assessment (EA) glass for Si, Li, Na and B ranges from 2 to 8 g/m{sup 2 }. The normalized release specification for LAW glass for the Hanford WTP is 2 g/m{sup 2 }. The Toxicity Characteristic Leach Test (TCLP) was performed on DMR and HTF as received samples and the tests showed that these products meet the criteria for the EPA RCRA Universal Treatment Standards for all of the constituents contained in the starting simulants such as Cr, Pb and Hg (RCRA characteristically hazardous metals) and Ni and Zn (RCRA metals required for listed wastes) ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to help all the teachers at twelve First and Middle schools to broaden their teaching of mathematics, providing planned activities for concept learning and opportunities tor discussion. The researcher acted both as change-agent and evaluator, with some help from the LEA advisers. The IDe. thodologyused was. action research and case-study. The fieldwork was arried out mainly between April 1976 and July 1979 in fourteen schools: six First, six Middle and two High schools in an Quter London borough where mathematics co-ordinators had recently been appointed in First and Middle schools. Preliminary observation visits were made and interviews were conducted to determine the teaching methods used and the teachers' attitudes to mathematics, past and present. In the past, the researcher had operated by means of working sessions for in-service education in mathematics. Despite a second round of working sessions such changes as were made were not sustained. In this project, in addition to providing working sessions the researcher visited all the project schools frequently to help individual teachers in their classrooms to make the changes desired. The working sessions were organised in two ways: at the teachers' centre for teams of key teachers from eight of the schools, and at four individual schools for the head and all the teachers, so that the relative effects of off-site and on-site working sessions could be compared. The two inputs of working sessions and support visits were divided by an interval of two terms, during which the researcher made regular visits to each school to work with groups of children and to monitor developments informally. The support visits of the second input were continued until Spring 1979. Final visits to the schools were made during 1980. Since there had been unexpected calls on the advisers' time, their observation visits to schools were seriously reduced. The researcher therefore had to rely for confirmation on the heads' estimates of the percentage changes made in the teaching of mathematics. She compared these estimates with her own, and set the agreed estimates against the total contributions made at each school by the head, the co-ordinator and the key teachers, bearing in mind the high <b>cumulative</b> staff <b>turnover</b> at each project school. The estimates of change ranged from 35 per cent to 70 per cent. The findings included: (1) Improving a school's teaching of mathematics (5 to 13 years) by in-service education takes at least three years; (2) In-service education comprising support visits to help individual teachers to make changes in their classrooms, as well as working sessions, is effective in terms of more lasting classroom changes; (3) The appointment of mathematics co-ordinators in First and Middle schools was useful, but they need prior training and a greater knowledge of mathematics {{if they are to be}} fully effective; (4) Heads, who have to act as facilitators, should also attend the training sessions for co-ordinators.

40|$| to 4 {{times more}} energy than a mammal, and live longer (Speakman, 2005 b). Another line of {{evidence}} comes from experiments on calorically restricted animals. Caloric restriction (CR; decreasing energy intake) is widely recognized as the only (non-genetic) manipulation that increases mean and maximum life span in mammals (first shown by (McCay et al., 1935)). In 1977 Sacher proposed that CR extended life span by decreasing metabolic rate. A study by Masoro et al. found that following the initiation of CR {{there was a brief}} period of reduced food intake per gram body mass, but this was followed by a lifetime where the intake per gram body mass was higher in CR rats than ad-libitum fed rats (Masoro et al., 1982). In a study where mass-specific 24 -h metabolic rates were measured mass-specific (based on lean mass) metabolic rates were reduced upon the initiation of CR, but increased to levels higher than ad-libitum fed animals later on (McCarter and Palmer, 1992). Similar results were shown in rhesus monkeys (Ramsey et al., 1996). These studies disagree with a role for metabolic rate in the life extending effect of CR. Interpretation of the results is confounded because metabolic rate is usually normalized for body mass or lean mass, whereas the relative sizes of organs are not the same for animals that are CR or fed ad libitum (Greenberg, 1999 b; Greenberg and Boozer, 2000). A related theory of ageing was suggested by Harman in 1956 known as the “free radical theory” (Harman, 1956). This theory specifies the reason why there should be a direct link between energy metabolism and the rate of ageing. Free radicals or radical oxygen species (ROS) are produced as by-products of normal oxidative phosphorylation, and can cause damage to macromolecules which may result in malfunction and eventually cell death (for review see (Beckman and Ames, 1998)). The body has evolved defense systems against these radicals in the form of antioxidant enzymes (e. g. superoxide dismutase, catalase and gluthione peroxidase) that scavenge ROS and transform them into less toxic products. A small amount of ROS escape conversion. If damage to macromolecules has occurred the processes of DNA repair and protein synthesis can repair most of this damage. Despite these defense systems a small amount of damage still occurs and this accumulates with age resulting in malfunction of cells and eventually death (see Figure 1. 1. for a graphical representation of the process). When energy expenditure (and oxidative phosphorylation) increases, the production of ROS will also increase. This would explain the relationship between ageing and metabolism proposed by the rate of living theory. The relationship between oxidative phosphorylation and ROS production is not linear. Oxidative phosphorylation takes place on the inner membrane of mitochondria {{as a result of the}} transport of electrons over the membrane (electron transport chain; ETC). The ETC consists of 4 complexes. NADH and FADH 2 that have been formed in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) donate their electrons to subsequently complex I or II which are then passed on to ubiquinone (Q). Q moves across the membrane to complex III and the electrons are passed on to cytochrome C that moves on to complex IV where the electrons are accepted by molecular oxygen and combined with protons to form water (for a more detailed description see (Brand, 2000 a)). During this process protons are pumped across the membrane into the inner membrane space and a proton motive force builds up. When oxidative phosphorylation is coupled these protons are pumped back to the matrix via an ATP-ase pump resulting in the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP (ATP synthesis). Free radicals are generated during oxidative phosphorylation when an oxygen molecule promiscuously reacts with one of the transported electrons before it reaches complex IV. This can for instance occur when the supply of ADP is limited thereby blocking up the system. Agents that increase respiration rate and thereby lower proton motive force (i. e., ATP synthesis) thus lower the rate of ROS production. ROS production is thus not linearly related to the rate of electron transport. The flow of electrons in the ETC is usually tightly coupled to the production of ATP, and it does not occur unless the phosphorylation of ADP can proceed. This prevents a waste of energy, because high-energy electrons do not flow unless ATP can be produced. If electron flow is uncoupled from the phosphorylation of ADP there would be no production of ATP, and the energy of the electrons would be wasted as heat. Uncoupling agents abolish the link between oxidation and phosphoryalation, allowing electron transport to proceed without coupled ATP synthesis, thereby increasing the respiration rate and lowering ROS production (Brand, 2000 b). Therefore, metabolic rate and free radical production are not necessarily linearly related. Many studies support the importance of antioxidants, oxidative stress and repair of oxidative damage for the ageing process. For instance, the importance of antioxidants enzymes is clear from studies with over-expression or knocking out of these enzymes. Overexpression of catalase and superoxide dismutase in Drosophila melanogaster increased median and maximum lifespan up to 30 % (Orr and Sohal, 1994; Sohal et al., 1995), and mice lacking manganese superoxide dismutase died within 10 days (Li et al., 1995), whereas administration of superoxide dismutase-catalase mimetics increased lifespan up to three times in mice (Melov et al., 2001). In CR animals life span extending effects have also been attributed to differences in oxidative stress. Increased antioxidant enzyme activity, DNA repair and protein synthesis, and decreased numbers of oxidatively damaged molecules have been shown in CR animals (for reviews see (Gredilla and Barja, 2005; Tavernarakis and Driscoll, 2002; Yu, 1996)). Whereas the “free radical” theory has gained much support in recent years, the rate of living theory has been discarded as invalid by many researchers based on inter-specific comparisons and the lack of effects on (or increases in) energy metabolism in CR animals. This is remarkable since the free radical theory of ageing is itself the main theory postulating the mechanism connecting energy turnover and ageing. As argued by Speakman (2002; 2005 c) the reasons to dispute the theory may not always be valid, because the arguments that are used to test the theory are fraught with problems. Firstly, maximum life span is not a good measure of ageing. Maximal life span is determined by a single point in every data base and is highly affected by the sample size used and also by the conditions in which animals are housed (i. e. laboratory or natural conditions). Secondly, basal metabolic rates have been used in most studies to estimate life-time energy potential. Basal metabolic rate is the metabolism of an animal when fasting and resting at thermo-neutral temperatures and contributes only 40 % to the total daily energy expenditure. The latter is a better measure of metabolism. Using a single measure of metabolic rate in the life time of an animal might not be sufficient to make an accurate estimate of life-time energy potential. Thirdly, testing for consistency in life-time energy expenditure per gram of tissue by inter-specific comparisons between birds and mammals is not the best way to test the rate of living theory and inter-specific comparisons are complicated by the fact that animals from different species may reflect adaptive or genetic differences in free-radical production or differences in defence and repair mechanisms. Therefore, intra-specific comparisons are more convincing when looking at associations between energy expenditure and ageing. A fourth argument relates to the scaling of energy expenditure to body mass. Greenberg has shown that in cases where no relation was found between life-time energy expenditure per gram body mass and life span, a relationship does exist when one calculates the energy expenditure for certain metabolically active organs and relate this to life span (Greenberg, 1999 a). Life-time energy expenditure per gram dry lean body mass instead of total body mass might be a better measure to test the rate of living theory since this contains the tissue that is metabolically most active. A stronger correlation between energy metabolism and dry lean mass is usually found then between body mass and energy expenditure. In studies on energy expenditure and life span almost never the body composition and energy turnover are followed throughout life. In order to resolve some of the confusion in this area we carried out two large scale experiments. We manipulated energy metabolism by either increasing activity through selection (chapter 6) or by decreasing environmental temperature (chapter 8) and looked at the relationship between energy metabolism and survival in intra-specific comparison. Mice selectively bred for high wheel-running activity were used to investigate the effects of increased voluntarily exercise. In the cold experiment, c 57 Bl/ 6 J mice were used that were subjected to 10 C compared to 22 C in control mice. An additional group that was exposed to cold early in life was added. This for the first time tests one basic implicit proposition in the rate of living and free radical theories: that the effects of energy <b>turnover</b> are <b>cumulative.</b> Energy <b>turnover</b> increase in youth should still have and effect in old age. In both experiments we paid specific attention to the effects of age and experimental manipulation (i. e. cold or activity) on two systems that are involved in defending the body against ROS, the antioxidant defence system and protein turnover (chapter 7 and chapter 9) ...|$|R
