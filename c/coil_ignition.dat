5|$|The first Super Cub {{variation}} was the C102, {{launched in}} April 1960. The C102 had electric start {{in addition to}} kick starting, and battery & <b>coil</b> <b>ignition</b> instead of magneto, but was otherwise {{the same as the}} C100.|$|E
25|$|The Benz Patent-Motorwagon and the Ford Model T used a {{trembler}} <b>coil</b> <b>ignition</b> system. A trembler coil was a battery-powered induction coil; the trembler {{interrupted the}} current through the coil and caused a quick series of sparks during each firing. The trembler coil would be energized at an appropriate {{point in the}} engine cycle. In the Model T, the four-cylinder engine had a trembler coil for each cylinder; a commutator (timer case) delivered power to the trembler coils. The Model T would be started on battery but then switched to an alternator.|$|E

50|$|Magneto {{ignition}} {{was introduced}} on the 1899 Daimler Phönix. This {{was followed by}} Benz, Mors, Turcat-Mery, and Nesseldorf, and soon was used on most cars up until about 1918 in both low voltage (voltage for secondary coils to fire the spark plugs) and high voltage magnetos (to fire the spark plug directly, similar to <b>coil</b> <b>ignitions,</b> introduced by Bosch in 1903).|$|R

50|$|Ignition {{takes place}} with {{individual}} <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> {{placed on the}} respective spark plug. The spark plugs, together with the <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> and combustion detection module (CDM), are used to detect combustion and possible knocking. This means {{there is no need}} for a camshaft position sensor or separate knock sensor.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> (also {{called a}} spark coil) is an {{induction}} coil in an automobile's ignition system that transforms the battery's low voltage {{to the thousands}} of volts needed to create an electric spark in the spark plugs to ignite the fuel. Some coils have an internal resistor, while others rely on a resistor wire or an external resistor to limit the current flowing into the coil from the car's 12-volt supply. The wire that goes from the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> to the distributor and the high voltage wires that go from the distributor to each of the spark plugs are called spark plug wires or high tension leads. Originally, every <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> system required mechanical contact breaker points and a capacitor (condenser). More recent electronic ignition systems use a power transistor to provide pulses to the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil.</b> A modern passenger automobile may use one <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> for each engine cylinder (or pair of cylinders), eliminating fault-prone spark plug cables and a distributor to route the high voltage pulses.|$|R
50|$|Many modern {{car engines}} have {{multiple}} <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> (one for {{each pair of}} cylinders) built into a coil pack, {{eliminating the need for}} a distributor and coil wire. Some car engines use a small <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> mounted on top of each spark plug, eliminating the need for spark plug wires entirely.|$|R
50|$|The new {{detachable}} {{aluminium alloy}} cylinder head was fitted over inclined side valves and anodised aluminium alloy pistons.

50|$|The engine, {{designated}} M 56 S 6 or 212, was a twin-cylinder boxer configuration - {{four stroke}} with a flathead design. The BMW R12 with two carburetors used a battery and <b>coil</b> <b>ignition,</b> while R12s {{with a single}} carburetor used a magneto ignition, capable of working independently from the battery.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine is}} a twin {{cylinder}} four-stroke, horizontally-opposed air-cooled, direct-drive gasoline engine design {{based on the}} Volkswagen air-cooled engine. It employs <b>coil</b> <b>ignition</b> and produces about [...] Unlike other half VWs this design does not require cutting the engine block in half, but instead blanks the two aft cylinders and removes the pistons.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> {{consists}} of a laminated iron core surrounded by two coils of copper wire. Unlike a power transformer, an <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> has an open magnetic circuit — the iron core does not form a closed loop around the windings. The energy that is stored in the magnetic field of the core is the energy that is transferred to the spark plug.|$|R

25|$|The <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> {{consists}} of two transformer windings — the primary and secondary. These windings share a common magnetic core. An alternating current in the primary induces an alternating magnetic field in the core and hence an alternating current in the secondary. The <b>ignition</b> <b>coil's</b> secondary has more turns than the primary. This is a step-up transformer, which produces a high voltage from the secondary winding.|$|R
5000|$|The Series 1A Interceptor was {{introduced}} in 1967, with two sub models GP7 and TT7. The major change was the introduction of <b>coil</b> <b>ignition,</b> eliminating the magneto. The US models received a new chrome tank, a new seat, instrument mounts, handlebar, and mudguards. [...] All S1A interceptors had twin Mark 1 Amal carburettors.|$|E
50|$|The Ten {{name was}} revived in 1932 {{for a small}} car {{available}} as a saloon, 4 seat coupé or 4 seat open tourer. The car was powered by a 1261 cc sidevalve engine with <b>coil</b> <b>ignition.</b> The suspension used semi-elliptic springs front and rear and the brakes were mechanically operated. The number made is uncertain.|$|E
50|$|Halted by World War II, {{production}} of the Model 50 single restarted in 1956. After 1959 the Model 50 gained the Featherbed frame, Lucas RM15 crank-mounted alternator (upgraded from magneto/dynamo used on 1957-58) <b>coil</b> <b>ignition</b> and improved lighting. In common with other large Nortons, the frame was updated to the 'slimline' version with revised styling in 1961.|$|E
50|$|Older engines {{also have}} a wire {{connecting}} the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> to the distributor, known as a coil wire. A coil wire is of the same construction as a spark plug wire, but generally shorter and with different terminals. Some distributors have an <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> built inside them, {{eliminating the need for}} a separate coil wire, e.g. GM High energy ignition system and some Toyotas and Hondas.|$|R

The <b>ignition</b> <b>coil's</b> secondary has more turns than the primary. This is a step-up transformer, which produces a high voltage from the secondary winding.The primary winding {{is connected to the}} battery (usually through a current-limiting ballast resistor). Inside the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> one end of each winding is connected together. This common point is taken to the capacitor/contact breaker junction. The other, high voltage, end of the secondary is connected to the distributor's rotor.|$|R
