40|$|The {{effects of}} price {{competition}} and advertising spillover on franchisees' decision {{to cooperate and}} on franchisor's contractual preferences are investigated. We show that the franchisees' decision to cooperate or not depends {{on the type of}} franchise <b>contracts.</b> Under exclusive <b>territory</b> <b>contracts,</b> any mode of play between franchisees give the same profits to the franchisees and franchisor. Contracts that allow price competition and well targeted local advertising offer a good ground for horizontal cooperation, {{which may or may not}} benefit the franchisor depending on whether the prices are strategic substitutes or strategic complements. Contracts in which price competition is allowed and the burden of advertising decisions is totally transferred to the franchisor lead to cooperation between franchisees at the expense of the franchisor. Franchisees do not cooperate to the benefit of the franchisor if local advertising is predatory and price competition is not allowed in the contract, but franchisees are given the responsibility to undertake local advertising. Also, the franchisor endorses cooperation between franchisees when local advertising has a public good nature, but such a cooperation may never occur when the impact of local advertising on demand is significant. We finally show that while some contracts always dominate others, the choice of a franchise contract may also depend on local competition and/or the franchise goodwill.

40|$|This work {{concerns}} the Upper Palaeolithic in the North-Mediterranean regions {{extending from the}} French to the Greek coastal belts. Great heterogeneity in the Palaeolithic record exists among different regions depending on the huge geographic modifications {{that occurred during the}} last glacial cycle and on the state of research in the countries considered. In many cases, this latter enables us to prove with certainty the real lack of human traces in a given territory. The MP-UP “transitional” industries are well represented by the Uluzzian mostly in Central-Southern Italy and Greece. The abrupt shift to the Aurignacian is largely recorded from several key-sites that provide a large amount of evidence relatingto the cultural layout and the settlement dynamics. The bladelet-dominated industries differentiate the Proto-Aurignacian from the classic Aurignacian sequence with scrapers, retouched blades and burins that are present but scarcely documented in a small number of sites. The middle UP is mainly chacarcterised by the Gravettian and the large spread of the Noailles-burin industries along the Tyrrenian coastal belt from the south-east of France, whereas the Adriatic area remains completely devoid of such types of occurrence. Significant cultural differentiations {{towards the end of the}} Gravettian period led to separate cultural trajectories being followed in two separate geographic spheres, namely the Solutrean to the west of the Rhône valley and the long-lasting Epigravettian phase to the east. Born out of from the Gravettian tradition, the Epigravettian industries indicate witness a few ephemeral contacts with the western area in the earlier phase and depict the boundaries of <b>contracted</b> <b>territories</b> during the Last Glacial Maximum advance. The late-glacial period sees the classic Magdalenian in the French area from the Pyrenees to the Rhône valley facing the easternmost region that still records Epigravettian occurrences. The interstadial marks huge shifts in the peopling process of new territories in several districts during the recent Epigravettian and behind the Rhône threshold in late Magdalenian. Traditionally defined on the basis of typological signatures, the Epigravettian has been recently re-examined under a more dynamic point of view that opens new perspectives on the cultural-behavioural variability...|$|R

In November–December 1944, the FlaK defences were more effective at shooting down Allied bombers than the Luftwaffe. One such example indicates that during sustained attacks on the synthetic oil targets inside the Ruhr, 59 USAAF bombers were lost to AAA, while just 13 were lost to German fighters. Heavy AAA did reduce the bombing accuracy as well as acting for a guide for German fighters searching for the bomber stream. Losses reached an all-time high on 26 November, when intercepting a raid, the RLV lost 119 fighters, 60 pilots killed and 32 wounded for just 25 USAAF fighters and six bombers.|$|R

We show that the latter effect tends to dominate the former, whereby making exclusive territories a more suitable organizational mode to sustain upstream cooperation. These insights carry over when manufacturers voluntarily decide whether to disclose contracts and can change the distribution mode every period; moreover, they strengthen under imperfect intrabrand competition.

40|$|Faced with a {{dynamically}} changing market, Boston Scientific's Cardiac Rhythm Management is seeking {{ways to increase}} its profitability. The division is experiencing a phenomenon where pulse generators and leads' product life cycle transitions may be slower than ideal. In addition, Boston Scientific is exploring ways to systematically and accurately assess its products' return on investments. The approach to the project is a technique called Profit Mapping. By carefully assessing the true full costs of each transaction, we can determine the actual profitability of each account and product and use the visualized results to detect anomalies, test hypotheses, and formulate action plans. The profit mapping tool allows us to compare profitability within each dimension of the business-individual product, account, sales person, <b>territory,</b> <b>contract</b> group, therapy system, or any combination of multiple dimensions. When we group data by accounts, we discover accounts that generate much higher profit than accounts that have higher revenue. Profit Map also shows some products or therapies traditionally believed to be unprofitable are actually high profit earners. Furthermore, time analysis of account profit maps revealed accounts whose revenue {{has been on the}} decline but profit on the rise thanks to transition in product mix. The delivery of the framework and its methodology concludes my internship but is only the beginning of Boston Scientific's journey to increase profitability. The Finance Department can now combine Profit Mapping data with the Sales Operations Department's experience and instincts to identify best practices that contribute towards higher revenue dollar efficiency, re-align sales incentives with company's profitability, and re-evaluate the opportunity cost of maintaining a marginal or net-loss account/product. In the long run, Profit Mapping can be scaled up to analyze world-wide data from all divisions to provide a clearer path to profitability. by Brian Chang. Thesis: M. B.

40|$|O setor sucroalcooleiro brasileiro passa por várias transformações econômicas, tecnológicas, produtivas e organizacionais, ao logo de sua história. Nestas há, inclusive, a mudança da forma como o Estado regula o setor que, a partir da década de 1990, altera a dinâmica concorrencial, institucional e de coordenação deste setor. Este passa por um processo de expansão (área em produção e da quantidade produzida) devido a estas mudanças e a outros fatores, como a tecnologia {{flex fuel}} e a busca por combustíveis de fontes renováveis. Esta expansão está associada, também, a disponibilidade de terras para a cultura agrícola da cana-de-açúcar, a necessidade da agroindústria em estabelecer contratos de obtenção de cana-de-açúcar e a decisão dos proprietários/produtores rurais em firmar estes contratos. Dentro deste contexto, busca-se, neste trabalho, identificar e analisar no Território, as relações contratuais, entre uma agroindústria sucroalcooleira e os proprietários/produtores rurais, a partir das teorias da Renda da Terra e da Economia dos Custos de Transação, tendo como expressão as relações de poder e as determinações territoriais. Para tal, realiza-se: pesquisa bibliográfica (referencial setorial e referencial teórico), pesquisa documental, coleta de dados secundários (sobre a cultura agrícola da cana-de-açúcar e demais formas de uso das terras agropecuário) e coleta de dados primários via entrevistas (pesquisador das ciências jurídicas; proprietários/produtores rurais; representante da agroindústria sucroalcooleira objeto e pesquisadores das ciências agrárias). É possível identificar nas características da relação contratual (transação) de obtenção de cana-de-açúcar, entre proprietários/produtores rurais e agroindústrias sucroalcooleiras, que há distinções, para as partes, quanto: aos aspectos econômico, jurídico e técnico; ao poder de barganha; e ao acesso de informações. Além disso, evidencia-se o comportamento oportunista, principalmente, por parte da agroindústria e a racionalidade limitada sobressaindo para o proprietário/produtor rural, devido à assimetria de informações entre as partes e à incerteza da transação. Para a transação se efetivar e permanecer, também devem ser considerados componentes como: solo; relevo e topografia; clima e temperatura; legislação ambiental; localização, tamanho e contiguidade da propriedade rural; condições de tráfego de rodovias e estradas de acesso; pedágio na rodovia; balança de pesagem na rodovia, posto militar rodoviário; rede de transmissão de energia elétrica; legislação municipal, cultura agrícola pré-estabelecida; documentos e inventários da propriedade rural e conhecimento técnico agrícola. A existência ou não destes componentes impactam na transação, no tipo de contrato a ser adotado e, desta forma, na renda da terra que pode ser apropriada de forma distinta entre os proprietários/produtores rurais e agroindústria sucroalcooleira, visto o poder de negociação. Assim, os componentes que a agroindústria sucroalcooleira se apropria ou define como favorável são determinações territoriais. Por outro lado, os componentes que a agroindústria sucroalcooleira não se apropria, visto que são desfavoráveis a esta, são classificadas como determinações espaciais Por fim, as particularidades do contrato e do território impactam as relações (de poder, econômica, produtivas, sociais) entre os agentes e, portanto, o território sucroalcooleiro. The Brazilian sugar and ethanol sector {{undergoes}} various economic, technological, productive and organizational transformations, throughout its history. In addition, {{there is a}} change in the way the state regulates the sector, which, starting in the 1990 s, changes the competitive, institutional and coordination dynamics of the sector. It goes through a process of expansion (production area and quality) due to these changes and other factors, such as flexible fuel technology and a search for renewable fuels. This expansion is also associated with land availability for the sugar cane crop, with the agribusiness necessity for establishing sugar cane concession contracts, and a decision by the owners / producers to sign these contracts. Within this context, the objective {{of this paper is to}} identify and analyze in the region, the contractual relations between a sugar-alcohol agroindustry and the land owners / producers, based on the theories of Land Income and Transaction Costs Economics, Emphasizing relations of power and territorial determinations. For this purpose, a research (sector referential and theoretical reference), documentary research, collection of secondary data (on the sugar cane crop and other forms of agricultural land use) and primary data collection via Interviews (researcher of legal sciences, landowners / farmers, representative of the sugar-alcohol agro-industry object and researchers of the agricultural sciences) has been performed. It is possible to identify in the characteristics of the contractual relation of obtaining sugarcane, between owners / producers and agribusinesses, that there are distinctions, for both, regarding: economic, legal and technical aspects; bargaining power; and the information access. Furthermore, the opportunistic behavior is evidenced mainly by the agroindustry and the limited rationality standing out for the rural owner / producer due to the asymmetry of information between the parties and the uncertainty of the transaction. For the transaction to be effective and to remain, it should also be considered components such as: soil; relief and topography; climate and temperature; environmental legislation; location, size and contiguity of the rural property; traffic conditions of highways and access roads; highway toll; weighing scale on the highway, military road station; electric power transmission network; municipal legislation, pre-established agricultural culture; documents and inventories of rural property and agricultural technical knowledge. The existence or not of these components impact on the transaction of the type of contract to be adopted and, in this way, on the income of the land that can be appropriated in a different way between the owners / producers and the sugar and alcohol agroindustry, given the bargaining power. Thus, the components that the sugar-alcohol agroindustry appropriates or defines as favorable are territorial determinations. On the other hand, the components that the sugar-alcohol agroindustry does not appropriate, since they are unfavorable to it, are classified as spatial determinations. Finally, the particularities of the <b>contract</b> and the <b>territory</b> impact the relations (of power, economic, productive, and social) between agents and, therefore, the sugar-alcohol territory...|$|R
