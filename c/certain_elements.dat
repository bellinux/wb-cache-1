5|$|Also in 1999, Capcom {{released}} the original Dino Crisis, which was noted for incorporating <b>certain</b> <b>elements</b> from survival horror games. It {{was followed by}} a more action-based sequel, Dino Crisis 2, in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{features}} doctrine developed in Kesavananda Bharati v. The State of Kerala (1973) and Minerva Mills Ltd. v. Union of India (1980) by the Supreme Court of India {{rests on the}} notion that there are <b>certain</b> <b>elements</b> of the nation's constitutional structure which cannot be amended by Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Although {{its origins}} are obscure, {{the site of}} the present ancient church has been used for Christian worship since it was settled in the early sixth century, {{probably}} by Saint Padarn, after whom it was named. Much of the early history of the church must remain speculative rather than definitive, due the absence of documentary or archaeological evidence. However, there are <b>certain</b> <b>elements</b> which are reasonably clear.|$|E

5000|$|Sacrificial {{coatings}} contain <b>certain</b> <b>element</b> (such as aluminum or zinc) which oxidize sacrificially {{to ensure}} the protected element remains corrosion free.|$|R
6000|$|Gust, {{after his}} own {{peculiar}} habit, had found means to {{delegate to the}} others the actual taking of life. Not that Gust entertained any scruples on the subject, other than those which induced in him a rare regard for his own personal safety. [...] There is always a <b>certain</b> <b>element</b> of risk to the assassin, for victims of deadly assault are seldom prone to die quietly and considerately. There is always a <b>certain</b> <b>element</b> of risk to {{go so far as}} to dispute the issue with the murderer. It was this chance of dispute which Gust preferred to forgo.|$|R
5|$|He uses {{overlapping}} forms {{rather than}} a single form or distinct adjacent forms, which seems {{to create a more}} dynamic feel to the shallow space. However, since Lichtenstein does not uses shading or contrast, the monochromatic strokes with just bold black outlines are void of <b>certain</b> <b>elements</b> of depth. Big Painting No. 6 and Yellow and Green Brushstrokes go one step further in terms of canvas size and dynamic activity that was presented earlier in Little Big Painting.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg {{published}} {{several books}} and journal articles {{during his tenure}} at the Atomic Energy Commission. He predicted the existence of elements beyond those on the periodic table, the transactinide series and the superactinide series of undiscovered synthetic elements. While most of these theoretical future elements have extremely short half-lives and thus no expected practical applications, he also hypothesized the existence of stable super-heavy isotopes of <b>certain</b> <b>elements</b> in an island of stability. Seaborg {{served as chairman of}} the Atomic Energy Commission until 1971.|$|E
5|$|Stories of mythical Orcadian demons are {{recorded}} in the 16th-century Latin manuscripts of Jo Ben, {{who may have been}} referring to the nuckelavee in his description of the Orkney island of Stronsay. Dennison transcribed much of the information available about traditional tales told on Orkney, but to an extent romanticised and systematically altered <b>certain</b> <b>elements</b> of the stories in the process of transforming them into prose.|$|E
5000|$|The {{game has}} 3 {{different}} types of elements, forming a weakness triangle. Quiz questions correspond to a <b>certain</b> <b>element,</b> therefore, answering questions of that element will cause the player's spirits to attack enemies with it.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} access a <b>certain</b> <b>element</b> of the list, {{one needs to}} recite the list step by step, much {{in the same vein}} as a linked list, {{in order to get the}} element from the system.|$|R
5|$|The Fate/stay night anime {{is based}} on the visual novel Fate/stay night by Type-Moon. The episodes are {{directed}} by Yuji Yamaguchi, animated by Studio Deen and produced by the Fate Project, which included Geneon Entertainment, TBS, CREi, Type-Moon and Frontier Works Inc. The plot of the episodes is primarily based on the Fate storyline in the Fate/stay night visual novel, although <b>certain</b> <b>elements</b> of the other two storylines, Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel, are incorporated into the plot.|$|E
5|$|The feature {{extraction}} using speeded up robust features (SURF) is {{also able to}} perform the inspection of <b>certain</b> <b>elements</b> having two possible states, such as pitot probes or static ports being covered or not covered. A pairing is performed between images of the element to be inspected in different states and that present on the scene. For these simple items to be inspected, an analysis during navigation is possible and preferable due to its time saving.|$|E
5|$|All {{episodes of}} the first season were written by Sam Egan and Kindler; Kindler hired Egan to assist in writing the first season, as he {{believed}} Egan to be creative, passionate, and talented. Several episodes {{of the first}} season were written throughout the Christmas season in 2007. After the series was given the green-light, they were rewritten to establish a season-long storyline. Some of the episodes finished their writing stage as little as {{two and a half}} weeks before filming commenced. At times after the scripts were written, Sci Fi executive Mark Stern fed back to the writers, asking for <b>certain</b> <b>elements</b> to be explained so the audience could understand.|$|E
50|$|Jewels {{gain the}} same random bonuses that items can. These {{can be placed}} into sockets. They {{have the same effect}} no matter what the base item is. Unique jewels are Rainbow Facets which have {{different}} bonuses to a <b>certain</b> <b>element.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{defection}} of Securitate general Ion Mihai Pacepa was, {{according to}} Lucia Hossu Longin, {{at least in}} part related to the order given to him by Ceauşescu, to obtain the technology for a <b>certain</b> <b>element</b> needed in the development of nuclear weapons.|$|R
50|$|Is: Historically {{called the}} “copula” verb, is {{can be used}} in constructions with nominal {{complements}} and adjectival complements. It also has the additional function of “topicalization”, a term that means a <b>certain</b> <b>element</b> of a sentence is being emphasized as the topic of interest.|$|R
5|$|Despite most {{games in}} the series taking place in {{different}} continuities, they do share <b>certain</b> <b>elements.</b> One of its defining traits is it being set in a contemporary urban environment, specifically modern-day Tokyo. Post-apocalyptic elements are a recurring feature in settings and narratives. This choice was originally made to set the game apart from other fantasy-based gaming franchises of the time, as modern day Tokyo was rarely seen in games as opposed to versions {{of it from the}} past. The Persona series takes place exclusively within this setting, spanning a single continuity and mostly focusing on the exploits of a group of young people.|$|E
5|$|Images of Sophiatown were {{initially}} {{built up in}} literature by a generation of South African writers: Can Themba, Bloke Modisane, Es'kia Mphahlele, Arthur Maimane, Todd Matshikiza, Nat Nakasa, Casey Motsisi and Lewis Nkosi who all lived in Sophiatown at various stages during the 1950s. They all shared <b>certain</b> <b>elements</b> of a common experience: education at St Peter's School and Fort Hare University, living in Sophiatown, working for Drum magazine, exile, banning under the Suppression of Communism Act and for many the writing of an autobiography.|$|E
5|$|Several {{months after}} the {{recommendation}} to have thiomersal removed from vaccines was published, a speculative article was published in Medical Hypotheses, a non-peer-reviewed journal, by parents who launched the parental advocacy group SafeMinds to promote the theory that thiomersal caused autism. The controversy began to gain legitimacy {{in the eyes of}} the public and gained widening support within <b>certain</b> <b>elements</b> in the autism advocacy community as well as in the political arena, with U.S. Representative Dan Burton openly supporting this movement and holding a number of Congressional hearings on the subject.|$|E
50|$|An HTML {{attribute}} is a modifier of an HTML element type. An attribute either modifies {{the default}} functionality of an element type or provides functionality to <b>certain</b> <b>element</b> types unable to function correctly without them. In HTML syntax, an attribute {{is added to}} an HTML start tag.|$|R
50|$|In {{the same}} interview, he also blames the poor {{critical}} reaction to 2001 as follows:Perhaps {{there is a}} <b>certain</b> <b>element</b> of the lumpen literati that is so dogmatically atheist and materialist and Earth-bound that it finds the grandeur of space and the myriad mysteries of cosmic intelligence anathema.|$|R
5000|$|Assessing relevance: Emotions help {{decision}} makers decide whether a <b>certain</b> <b>element</b> {{of the decision}} is relevant to their particular situations. Each person’s personal history and state(s) of mind leads to {{a different set of}} relevant information. The two such emotions most studied to date are regret and disappointment.|$|R
5|$|The Iowa {{class has}} become {{culturally}} symbolic in the United States {{in many different}} ways, {{to the point where}} <b>certain</b> <b>elements</b> of the American public—such as the United States Naval Fire Support Association—are unwilling to part with the battleships despite their apparent obsolescence in the face of modern naval combat doctrine that places great emphasis on air supremacy and missile firepower. Although all have been officially stricken from the Naval Vessel Register they have been spared scrapping and were donated for use as museum ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} an atom {{will have no}} spin when it has even numbers of both {{neutrons}} and protons, but for other cases of odd numbers, the nucleus may have a spin. Normally nuclei with spin are aligned in random directions because of thermal equilibrium. However, for <b>certain</b> <b>elements</b> (such as xenon-129) {{it is possible to}} polarize a significant proportion of the nuclear spin states so that they are aligned in the same direction—a condition called hyperpolarization. This has important applications in magnetic resonance imaging.|$|E
5|$|The {{pulsations}} {{result from}} a process called the κ-mechanism. A part of the star's outer atmosphere becomes optically thick due to partial ionization of <b>certain</b> <b>elements.</b> When these atoms lose an electron, the likelihood that they will absorb energy increases. This results {{in an increase in}} temperature that causes the atmosphere to expand. The inflated atmosphere becomes less ionized and loses energy, causing it to cool and shrink back down again. The result of this cycle is a periodic pulsation of the atmosphere and a matching variation of the luminosity.|$|E
50|$|Finally, the Immaculate Conception Emblem of Almonte {{is brought}} to the Shrine, {{at which point the}} Almontese carry the Virgin of El Rocío out into the village streets. The timing of this event differs from one year to the next, so there is always a <b>certain</b> <b>element</b> of spontaneity to it.|$|R

Here is pseudocode that performs a partition about the element : ...|$|R
40|$|There {{are both}} {{domestic}} and foreign concerns that Turkey is a theocracy in the making or some “attenuated” version thereof.   While most of these concerns are full of extravagant exaggerations, often suggesting Iran as an example Turkey is allegedly headed towards, there is a <b>certain</b> <b>element</b> of truth embedded in these concerns...|$|R
5|$|<b>Certain</b> <b>elements</b> of the {{character}} are drawn from the real Colbert's personal life. Both the real Colbert and {{the character}} were raised in Charleston, South Carolina; both are the youngest of 11 children; both played Dungeons & Dragons as teenagers; and both are practicing Roman Catholics. Colbert's own interest in and knowledge of religion, science fiction, and J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings story will often show through in the Report. His character has a chocolate portrait of Viggo Mortensen (who portrayed Aragorn in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings films) {{in a place of}} honor on his shelf; Mortensen briefly reprised the role of Aragorn in the Reports September 13, 2007 episode. He also owns a Sting sword presented to him by Peter Jackson.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) {{decided to}} draft {{legislation}} {{to make the}} Hinomaru and Kimigayo official symbols of Japan in 2000. His Chief Cabinet Secretary, Hiromu Nonaka, wanted the legislation {{to be completed by}} the 10th anniversary of Emperor Akihito's enthronement. This {{is not the first time}} legislation was considered for establishing both symbols as official. In 1974, with the backdrop of the 1972 return of Okinawa to Japan and the 1973 oil crisis, Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei hinted at a law being passed enshrining both symbols in the law of Japan. In addition to instructing the schools to teach and play Kimigayo, Kakuei wanted students to raise the Hinomaru flag in a ceremony every morning, and to adopt a moral curriculum based on <b>certain</b> <b>elements</b> of the Imperial Rescript on Education pronounced by the Meiji Emperor in 1890. Kakuei was unsuccessful in passing the law through the Diet that year.|$|E
5|$|Public {{anticipation}} for {{the game}} was high, owing to the video's demonstration of some two-dimensional gameplay, seen as a possible return to Sonic's platforming roots. However, critical reception for Sonic Unleashed was mixed, with reviewers praising <b>certain</b> <b>elements,</b> such as the sense of speed in daylight stages and the graphics and audio {{that make up the}} environments, and criticizing others, such as the new Werehog game mechanic, as well as several gameplay and design concepts. Many reviewers felt that Unleashed was ultimately not the title that would be able to reinvigorate the series. Sonic Unleashed was de-listed in 2010, following Sega's decision to remove all Sonic titles with average or lower Metacritic scores from sale in stores. Despite this, the game was released on the PlayStation Network in April 2014.|$|E
50|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for lords and ladies to specifically breed certain thralls, or shape their transformation, for specific powers such as telepathy, however the mutation caused by vampirism is not entirely controllable even by the greatest Wamphyrii. This fact leaves a <b>certain</b> <b>element</b> of chance to what the end result may be.|$|R
