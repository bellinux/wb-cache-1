5|$|Public {{and artistic}} {{opinion of the}} new pieces was, and remains, mixed. In 1915, Mint {{officials}} began plans to replace them, after the design's minimum term expired in 1916. The Mint issued Barber dimes and quarters in 1916 to meet commercial demand, but {{before the end of}} the year, the Mercury dime, Standing Liberty quarter, and Walking Liberty half dollar had begun production. Most dates in the Barber <b>coin</b> <b>series</b> are not difficult to obtain, but the 1894 dime struck at the San Francisco Mint (1894-S), with a mintage of 24, is a great rarity.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Head gold pieces or Pratt-Bigelow {{gold coins}} were two {{separate}} <b>coin</b> <b>series,</b> identical in design, {{struck by the}} United States Mint: a two-and-a-half dollar piece, or quarter eagle, and a five-dollar coin, or half eagle. The quarter eagle was struck from 1908 to 1915 and from 1925–1929. The half eagle was struck from 1908 to 1916, and in 1929. The pieces remain the only US circulating coins with recessed designs. These coins were the last of their denominations to be struck for circulation, ending a series which had begun in the 1790s.|$|E

5000|$|In April 2011, it was {{reported}} that new coins would be minted that would use less metal and thus lower costs. Counterfeiting would also be harder.

5|$|The Norse-American medal {{is not a}} coin, and is {{not legal}} tender. Due to its {{similarity}} to a coin, {{and the fact that}} it was authorized by Congress, it is sometimes collected as part of the U.S. commemorative <b>coin</b> <b>series.</b> Though the silver ones can be purchased for less than $100 up to $500, and the silver-plated one for between $500 and $3,500, the gold specimen has sold for as high as $40,000. Some medals were used as pocket pieces or worn in mountings to the fair, and display damage or wear.|$|E

5000|$|A {{series of}} {{commemorative}} silver coins {{was introduced in}} 2011. The <b>coins</b> in this <b>series</b> were sold at their face value of twenty Canadian dollars. They have a specimen finish and are [...]9999 pure silver, weighing 7.96 grams. The coins were sold by the Mint encapsulated in hard plastic and included a certificate of authenticity. With each release, the Royal Canadian Mint redirected the domain 20for20.ca to the latest <b>coin</b> in the <b>series.</b> In 2012, the third <b>coin</b> in the <b>series</b> became available for order, and a subscription program was introduced allowing customers to purchase the next two <b>coins</b> of the <b>series</b> whose designs {{had yet to be}} announced. The first coin of the subscription commemorated the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II and the second commemorated the end of production of the Canadian Penny, both occurring in 2012. Notably, the Diamond Jubilee coin bears a unique reverse design depicting a younger Queen compared {{to the rest of the}} <b>coins</b> in the <b>series.</b> A fourth <b>coin</b> was released in 2012 during the holiday season and bore a stylized reindeer on the reverse. The series continued into 2013 with a coin commemorating hockey and another depicting a wolf.|$|R

25|$|Coins {{were issued}} in 1947 after the {{revaluation}} in denominations of 50 bani, 1, 2, and 5 leu and depicted {{the portrait of}} King Michael I.

All second leu coins were discontinued and devalued in late 1952.|$|E

25|$|Their Vancouver 2010 coin program {{included}} the largest circulation <b>coin</b> <b>series</b> {{in relation to}} the Olympic and Paralympic Games ever conceived by any mint worldwide.

These commemorative 25¢ coins were distributed across the country through participating Petro-Canada and Royal Bank of Canada locations.|$|E
25|$|A new <b>coin</b> <b>series</b> {{which not}} only {{increased}} awareness in the RCM but acknowledged Canada's cultural differences was launched {{near the end of}} the decade. The Chinese Lunar New Year Collection debuted in 1998 with the Year of the Tiger coin. The centre featured the fierce Tiger in a gold plated cameo while the rim found the Tiger surrounded by all twelve animal zodiacs. All the images from this collection are courtesy of artist Harvey Chan. With a face value of $15, this set ended in 2009 with the Year of the Ox.|$|E

The two-baht coin, confusingly similar in color and size to the one-baht coin, was changed from nickel-clad low-carbon steel to aluminium bronze. New two-baht coin {{was the first of the}} new series released on February 3, 2009, followed by a satang coin in April, a five-baht coin in May, a ten-baht coin in June, and a one-baht coin in July 2009.|$|E

25|$|The decade {{also saw}} the birth of several new <b>coin</b> <b>series</b> which used {{innovative}} techniques {{that had never been}} before. These techniques were the use of a gold cameo in the coin. The first set that was part of this great innovation was the Aviation Collection, which debuted in 1990. The Canadian aviation heroes were commemorated on a 20-coin set. Every coin in the collection consisted of a 24-karat, gold-covered oval cameo portrait of an aviation hero--a first for the Royal Canadian Mint. The coin itself featured a different plane ranging from the Gypsy Moth to the legendary Avro Arrow. These were proof coins while the case of issue was an aluminum case {{in the shape of a}} wing.|$|E
25|$|The {{series is}} {{therefore}} {{divided into three}} sequences, {{each with its own}} metal colour. This division into colours has its roots in history. In earlier times, the value of the coins was equivalent to the value of the metal from which they were minted: gold was used for the coins of the highest denominations, silver for the next-highest, and copper for the lowest coin denominations. This correlation between colour and value has been retained in the present <b>coin</b> <b>series</b> (see examples to the right). The 50-øre coins are thus minted from copper-coloured bronze, the 1-, 2- and 5-krone coins from a silver-coloured cupronickel alloy, and the 10- and 20-krone coins from golden aluminium bronze.|$|E
25|$|On various occasions, {{commemorative}} coins are minted, {{often in}} gold and silver with face values up to 100,000 yen. The first of these were silver ¥100 and ¥1000 Summer Olympic coins issued {{on the occasion of}} the 1964 games. Recently this practice is undertaken with the 500-yen coin, the first two types were issued in 1985, in commemoration of the science and technology exposition in Tsukuba and the 100th anniversary of the Governmental Cabinet system. The current commemorative 500- and 1000-yen <b>coin</b> <b>series</b> honouring the 47 prefectures of Japan commenced in 2008, with 47 unique designs planned for each denomination. Only one coin per customer is available from banks in each prefecture. 100,000 of each 1000-yen silver coin have been minted. Even though all commemorative coins can be spent like ordinary (non-commemorative) coins, they are not seen often in typical daily use and normally do not circulate.|$|E

25|$|The {{hot spring}} {{water has been}} popularly {{believed}} for centuries to possess medicinal properties, and was a subject of legend among several Native American tribes. Following federal protection in 1832, the city developed into a successful spa town. Incorporated January 10, 1851, {{the city has been}} home to Major League Baseball spring training, illegal gambling, speakeasies and gangsters such as Al Capone, horse racing at Oaklawn Park, the Army and Navy Hospital, and 42nd President Bill Clinton. The area was made a national park on March 4, 1921. It is the smallest national park by area in the United States and could fit into the largest National Park in the United States, Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, almost 2,400 times. Since Hot Springs National Park is the oldest park maintained by the National Park Service, it was the first to receive its own US quarter in April 2010 as part of the America the Beautiful Quarters <b>coin</b> <b>series.</b>|$|E
500|$|Once {{authorized}} by Congress, they were produced in various metals and sizes, {{for the most}} part prior to the celebrations near Minneapolis in June 1925.

They are sometimes collected as part of the U.S. commemorative <b>coin</b> <b>series.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar was a fifty-cent piece struck {{intermittently}} by the United States Bureau of the Mint between 1926 and 1939.

[...] Struck over a lengthy period in small numbers per year, the many varieties produced came {{to be considered a}} ripoff by coin collectors, and led to the end, for the time, of the commemorative <b>coin</b> <b>series.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these general circulation <b>coins,</b> numerous <b>series</b> of commemorative <b>coins</b> have been issued, as well as silver and gold coins.
