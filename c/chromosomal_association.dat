40|$|Human {{adenovirus}} type 12 (Ad 12) infects {{human cells}} productively {{and leads to}} viral replication, whereas infection of hamster cells remains abortive, with total blocks in viral DNA replication and late viral gene transcription. The intranuclear fate of Ad 12 DNA in productively infected human cells and in abortively infected hamster cells was monitored by using the fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) technique. Human HeLa cells, primary human umbilical cord fibroblasts, hamster BHK 21 cells, primary embryonal hamster cells, and the Ad 12 -transformed T 637 hamster cell line were studied. As early as 2 h after infection, extensive association of Ad 12 DNA with metaphase chromosomes was demonstrated by FISH {{in all of these}} cells. <b>Chromosomal</b> <b>association</b> continued until late (24 to 28 h) after infection, when about 100 % of the human cell nuclei and 70 to 80 % of the hamster cell nuclei showed distinct FISH signals. This <b>chromosomal</b> <b>association</b> of Ad 12 DNA in infected cells seemed to be rather firm, since it proved to be resistant to mechanically stretching the chromosomes and to different types of chemical treatment. Moreover, laser scan microscopy of mechanically stretched chromosomes from Ad 12 -infected HeLa cells and from the Ad 12 -transformed T 637 cell line, with about 20 copies of Ad 12 DNA provably integrated, revealed identical FISH patterns. Therefore, it was likely that even in infected cells the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>association</b> of Ad 12 DNA was very similar to the integrated state. Late in productively infected cells, large nuclear areas were taken over by viral DNA replication, as visualized by FISH in interphase nuclei. <b>Chromosomal</b> <b>association</b> at many sites was frequently limited to one chromatid, but signals in adjacent positions on both chromatids were also seen. Upon the long-term cultivation and passage of abortively infected BHK 21 cells for 96 h after infection, a gradual decrease of viral DNA association with chromosomes was observed. Integration of Ad 12 DNA in hamster cells early after infection was previously documented, and recombination between viral and cellular DNAs in human cells was also shown. The FISH data on extensive <b>chromosomal</b> <b>association</b> of Ad 12 DNA suggest a means to study the pathway of Ad 12 DNA from early steps in viral infection via chromosomal interactions to integration events. In a different approach, Ad 12 DNA, Ad 12 DNA with the terminal protein covalently linked to its ends (Ad 12 DNA-TP), or Ad 2 DNA was simply added to the culture medium of HeLa or BHK 21 cells. Precipitation or selection procedures were avoided. Depending on the experimental conditions, up to 25 to 30 % of the interphase nuclei of HeLa cells and 9 to 19 % of the interphase nuclei of BHK 21 cells showed positive FISH signals at 24 h after the addition of DNA. Viral DNA also became associated in some cases with both chromatids. The uptake of Ad 12 DNA-TP appeared to be 10 to 20 times more efficient than that of Ad 12 DNA completely freed of proteins. Control bacteriophage lambda, M 13, or plasmid DNA could not be detected in the nuclei under these conditions...|$|E

Recently, a mammalian PcG complex has been identified with several PcG proteins implicated in the regulation of Hox gene expression. Although the mammalian PcG complex appears analogous to the complex in Drosophila, the molecular mechanisms and functions for the mammalian PcG complex remain unknown.

40|$|Although the {{importance}} of chromosome organization during mitosis is clear, {{it remains to be}} determined whether the nucleus assumes other functionally relevant chromosomal topologies. We have previously shown that homologous chromosomes have a tendency to associate during hematopoiesis according to their distribution of coregulated genes, suggesting cell-specific nuclear organization. Here, using the mathematical approaches of distance matrices and coupled oscillators, we model the dynamic relationship between gene expression and <b>chromosomal</b> <b>associations</b> during the differentiation of a multi-potential hematopoietic progenitor. Our analysis reveals dramatic changes in total genomic order: commitment of the progenitor results in an initial increase in entropy at both the level of gene co-regulation and chromosomal organization, which we suggest represents a phase transition, followed by a progressive decline in entropy during differentiation. The stabilization of a highly ordered state in the differentiated cell types results in lineage-specific chromosomal topologies and is related to the emergence of coherence—or self-organization—between <b>chromosomal</b> <b>associations</b> and coordinate gene regulation. We discuss how these observations may be generally relevant to cell fate decisions encountered by progenitor/stem cells. ...|$|R

A secondary association between bivalents is considered to be of immense importance as it is being taken as a gauge of ploidy in plants.

Whether this function is conserved in mammals is currently not known. During mammalian meiosis, very different localisation patterns have been reported for the SMC complexes, and the localisation of Nipbl/Mau 2 has just recently started to be investigated. Here, we show that Nipbl/Mau 2 binds on chromosomal axes from zygotene to mid-pachytene in germ cells of both sexes. In spermatocytes, Nipbl/Mau 2 then relocalises to chromocenters, whereas in oocytes it remains bound to chromosomal axes throughout prophase to dictyate arrest. The localisation pattern of Nipbl/Mau 2, together with those seen for cohesin, condensin and Smc 5 / 6 subunits, is consistent with a role as a loading factor for cohesin and condensin I, but not for Smc 5 / 6. We also demonstrate that Nipbl/Mau 2 localises next to Rad 51 and γH 2 AX foci. NIPBL gene deficiencies are associated with the Cornelia de Lange syndrome in humans, and we find that haploinsufficiency of the orthologous mouse gene results in an altered distribution of double-strand breaks marked by γH 2 AX during prophase I.

40|$|AbstractViruses that {{establish}} {{latent infection}} must maintain their DNA {{in the host}} nucleus through many cellular generations. Here we identify a novel mechanism by which the gammaherpesvirus Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) may achieve this persistence in latently infected body cavity-based lymphoma (BCBL) cells. We find that KSHV genomic DNA is associated with host chromosomes and colocalizes with the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA). Furthermore, a region at the left end of the KSHV genome binds strongly to LANA and can colocalize to the host chromosomes with LANA. Additionally, we found that LANA associates with histone H 1 in KSHV-infected BCBL cells. We propose that this <b>chromosomal</b> <b>association</b> of the KSHV genome is mediated by LANA and involves a tethering mechanism by which viral episomes are linked to host chromatin through simultaneous interaction with host chromosomal proteins including histone H 1 and cis-acting KSHV DNA elements.

Supporting a crucial role for the cofactor in viral replication, HIV- 1 vector integration and reporter gene expression were significantly reduced in LEDGF-null cells. Yet, integrase processed the viral cDNA termini normally and maintained its local target DNA sequence preference during integration. Preintegration complexes extracted from knockout cells moreover supported normal levels of DNA strand transfer activity in vitro. In contrast, HIV- 1 lost its strong bias toward integrating into transcription units, displaying instead increased affinity for promoter regions and CpG islands. Our results reveal LEDGF/p 75 as a critical targeting factor, commandeering lentiviruses from promoter- and/or CpG island-proximal pathways that are favored by other members of Retroviridae. Akin to yeast retrotransposons, disrupting the lentiviral targeting mechanism significantly perturbs overall integration...|$|E
40|$|Ribosomal {{proteins}} (RPs) {{are essential}} components of ribosomes, but several RPs are also present at transcription sites of eukaryotic chromosomes. Here, we report a genome-wide ChIP-on-chip {{analysis of the}} association of three representative 60 S RPs with sites in the Schizosaccharomyces pombe chromosomes. All three proteins tend to bind at the same subset of coding and noncoding loci. The data demonstrate selective RNA-dependent interactions between RPs and many transcription sites and suggest that the RPs bind as components of a preassembled multiprotein complex, perhaps 60 S or pre- 60 S subunits. These findings further indicate that the presence of RPs complexes at transcription sites might be a general feature of eukaryotic cells and functionally important. Unexpectedly, the RPs' <b>chromosomal</b> <b>association</b> is highest at centromeres and tRNA genes—the RPs were found at 167 of the 171 tRNA genes assayed. These findings raise the intriguing possibility that RP complexes are involved in tRNA biogenesis and possibly centromere functions...|$|E

Thr 3 of histone H 3 is highly conserved, but the significance of its phosphorylation is unclear, and {{the identity of the}} corresponding kinase unknown. Immunostaining with phospho-specific antibodies in mammalian cells reveals mitotic phosphorylation of H 3 Thr 3 in prophase and its dephosphorylation during anaphase. Furthermore we find that haspin, a member of a distinctive group of protein kinases present in diverse eukaryotes, phosphorylates H 3 at Thr 3 in vitro. Importantly, depletion of haspin by RNA interference reveals that this kinase is required for H 3 Thr 3 phosphorylation in mitotic cells. In addition to its <b>chromosomal</b> <b>association,</b> haspin is found at the centrosomes and spindle during mitosis. Haspin RNA interference causes misalignment of metaphase chromosomes, and overexpression delays progression through early mitosis.

40|$|Background: Sister {{chromatid}} cohesion {{depends on}} a complex called cohesin, which contains at least four subunits: Smc 1, Smc 3, Scc 1 and Scc 3. Cohesion is established during DNA replication, is partially dismantled in many, but not all, organisms during prophase, and is finally destroyed at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. A quite separate protein called Spo 76 is required for sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis in the ascomycete Sordaria. Spo 76 -like proteins are highly conserved amongst eukaryotes and a homologue in Aspergillus nidulans, called BimD, {{is required for the}} completion of mitosis. The isolation of the cohesin subunit Smc 3 as a suppressor of BimD mutations suggests that Spo 76 /BimD might function in the same process as cohesin. Results: We show here that the yeast homologue of Spo 76, called Pds 5, is essential for establishing sister chromatid cohesion and maintaining it during metaphase.

We identified the NLS of LEDGF/p 75 through deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis. The LEDGF/p 75 NLS, 148 GRKRKAEKQ 156, belongs to the canonical SV 40 -like family. Fusion of this short peptide to the amino terminus of Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase rendered the fusion protein nuclear, confirming that the LEDGF/p 75 NLS is transferable.

40|$|One of the {{mechanisms}} by which papillomaviruses establish persistent infection of the host is by tethering their genomes to host chromosomes during mitosis. This ensures maintenance and partitioning of the viral genomes to daughter cells after each cell division. Although {{studies have shown that}} the viral E 2 protein links the viral genome to host chromosomes in several papillomaviruses, the exact molecular mechanism of this interaction has yet to be elucidated for the beta-papillomaviruses. The studies described in this dissertation aimed to characterize the interaction of the E 2 protein of the human papillomavirus type 8 (HPV 8), a type of beta-papillomavirus, with mitotic chromosomes. The E 2 protein consists of a conserved N-terminal transactivation domain and a C-terminal DNA binding and dimerization domain that are linked by a flexible hinge. We have mapped a sixteen amino acid region in the hinge that, when linked to the DNA binding domain, is crucial and sufficient for <b>chromosomal</b> <b>association.</b> Further we have identified two residues in this region, arginine 250 (R 250) and serine 253 (S 253) within a highly conserved RXXS motif that are required for HPV 8 E 2 chromosome binding. Additionally, we have shown that the S 253 residue is phosphorylated. To gain insight into the regulation of the E 2 chromosome binding function, we investigated the role of phosphorylation of S 253. We have shown that S 253 is phosphorylated by PKA in S-phase, which increases the half-life of E 2 protein and modulates its interaction with host chromatin. Since E 2 is also involved in transcriptional regulation and viral genome replication, we examined if mutating residues R 250 or S 253 affected the transcriptional activation or replication functions of the HPV 8 E 2 protein. Furthermore using a domain swapping approach, we also explored the role of the C-terminal domain in the HPV 8 E 2 chromosome binding function. Finally to establish the mode of interaction responsible for mediating HPV 8 E 2 chromosome binding, we employed both a proteomics approach and ribonuclease treatment techniques, to examine whether HPV 8 E 2 <b>chromosomal</b> <b>association</b> is mediated through protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions, respectively. Collectively, these studies have added to our current understanding of the interaction of HPV 8 E 2 protein with host chromosomes...|$|E

Most importantly, we show that individual dsRBDs are capable of recognizing different chromosomal sites in an apparently specific manner. Thus, our results not only prove the requirement of dsRBDs for chromosomal targeting, but also show that individual dsRBDs have distinct in vivo localization capabilities that may be important for initial substrate recognition and subsequent editing specificity...|$|E

40|$|Maintenance of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) {{latent infection}} {{depends on the}} viral episomes in the nucleus being distributed to daughter cells following cell division. The latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is constitutively expressed in all KSHV-infected cells. LANA binds sequences in the terminal repeat regions of the KSHV genome and tethers the viral episomes to chromosomes. To better understand the mechanism of chromosomal tethering, we performed glutathione S-transferase (GST) affinity and yeast two-hybrid assays to identify LANA-interacting proteins with known <b>chromosomal</b> <b>association.</b> Two of the interactors were the methyl CpG binding protein MeCP 2 and the 43 -kDa protein DEK.

40|$|Successful {{execution}} of the meiotic program depends on the timely establishment and removal of sister chromatid cohesion. LAB- 1 has been proposed {{to act in the}} latter by preventing the premature removal of the meiosis-specific cohesin REC- 8 at metaphase I in C. elegans, yet the mechanism and scope of LAB- 1 function remained unknown. Here we identify an unexpected earlier role for LAB- 1 in promoting the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion in prophase I. LAB- 1 and REC- 8 are both required for the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>association</b> of the cohesin complex subunit SMC- 3. Depletion of lab- 1 results in partial loss of sister chromatid cohesion in rec- 8 and coh- 4 coh- 3 mutants and further enhanced chromatid dissociation in worms where all three kleisins are mutated. Moreover, lab- 1 depletion results in increased Aurora B kinase (AIR- 2) signals in early prophase I nuclei, coupled with a parallel decrease in signals for the PP 1 homolog, GSP- 2. Finally, LAB- 1 directly interacts with GSP- 1 and GSP- 2.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{faithfully}} propagate the genetic material {{from one generation}} to the next, cells need to properly replicate and segregate their chromosomes. The three well-conserved eukaryotic Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes, cohesin, condensin and the Smc 5 / 6 complex (Smc 5 / 6) organize chromosomes to ensure that the daughter cells receive a full complement of chromosomes. Cohesin holds sister chromatids, which are the products of replication, together to allow chromosome biorientation prior to segregation. Condensin promotes the condensation of chromosomes to allow them to segregate away from each other during anaphase. The least well-characterized SMC complex, Smc 5 / 6, promotes proper DNA replication, and correct segregation of the ribosomal DNA. Another group of proteins that organizes chromosomes are the topoisomerases. These enzymes cut and paste chromosomes to allow the unwinding of the DNA double helix during replication, and the untangling of chromosomes during segregation. Failure to correctly execute these fundamental processes often leads to cell death. However, it can also lead to cells acquiring the wrong number of chromosomes, i. e. aneuploidy, which is a hallmark of cancer cells. Knowledge of how chromosomes are organized and maintained is therefore important not only to understand the basic principles of life, but also to understand cancerous cells. With the projects presented in this thesis, we aimed to extend our knowledge about the functions of Smc 5 / 6 and topoisomerases during DNA replication and chromosome segregation, using the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae). Since the SMC complexes perform their functions by directly associating with chromosomes, an important focus of our studies has been to characterize the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>association</b> pattern of Smc 5 / 6 in detail, in order to reveal new clues about its functions. The main findings of the four projects are introduced below. In Paper I, we presented new functions of Smc 5 / 6 and type I topoisomerases in the timely replication of long S. cerevisiae chromosomes. We also showed that the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>association</b> of Smc 5 / 6 is regulated by chromosome length and topoisomerase II. The data allowed us to propose a model in which Smc 5 / 6 promotes replication by stimulating fork rotation to reduce topological stress ahead of the fork. In Paper II, we showed that Smc 5 / 6 requires sister chromatids to be held together in order to associate with chromosomes. Smc 5 / 6 was also shown to promote correct segregation of short entangled chromosomes. Our extensive characterization of the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>association</b> of Smc 5 / 6 led us to the hypothesis that Smc 5 / 6 associates to chromosomal loci where the sister chromatids are entangled, and that topological stress during replication affect the level of chromosome entanglement. In Paper III, we created a hard-to-replicate region of DNA by artificially inducing high convergent RNA polymerase II-driven transcription. This caused the replication fork to pause, which was dependent on the highly expressed gene that opposed the direction of replication. The paused fork was assisted past this obstacle by the Rrm 3 helicase. In addition, Smc 5 / 6 associated to chromatin behind the paused fork, where it remained also after replication. Our results strengthened the hypothesis that topological stress is a factor that contributes to the recruitment of Smc 5 / 6 to chromosomes. In Paper IV, we dissected the role of the Nse 5 subunit of Smc 5 / 6 during replication stress induced by hydroxyurea, which inhibits the production of nucleotides. We showed that Nse 5 is required for the sumoylation of Smc 5, and the recruitment of the complex to stalled forks. The results also indicated that the former of these functions is dispensable, while the latter is important, for Smc 5 / 6 to stabilize stalled replication forks and prevent aberrant recombination at these forks. The results of this thesis increase our understanding of how chromosomes are replicated and segregated, and highlight the importance of analyzing the topological status of chromosomes to fully understand the processes that maintain genome stability...|$|E
40|$|Cytogenetic {{characterization}} {{was carried}} out on 12 accessions from Aster squamatus (Spreng.) Hieron., Pterocaulon polystachyum DC, and Solidago microglossa DC by studying their meiotic behavior and pollen viability. These species are from the Asteraceae family, native to Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, and are important for medicinal use. Young inflorescences with four accessions of each species were collected, fixed in ethanol-acetic acid (3 : 1), and conserved in ethanol 70 % until use. The method used was that of squashing the anthers and coloring with acetic orcein 2 %. Meiosis was regular in all accessions, presenting <b>chromosomal</b> <b>associations</b> preferentially bivalent, where n= 10 was found for Aster squamatus and n= 9 for Pterocaulon polystachyum, and Solidago microglossa. The studied accessions presented a Meiotic Index (MI) that varied from 65 % to 87 % in Aster squamatus, 85 % to 92 % in Pterocaulon polystachyum, and 64 % to 92 % in Solidago microglossa, indicating meiotic stability, although irregularities appeared during the cellular division.

40|$|The D 1 {{protein is}} a high {{mobility}} group A (HMGA) -like nonhistone chromosomal protein with primary localization to certain AT-rich satellite DNA sequences within heterochromatin. The binding of D 1 to euchromatic sequences is less studied and the functional significance of its <b>chromosomal</b> <b>associations</b> is unclear. By taking advantage of existing P-insertion alleles of the D 1 gene, I generated D 1 null mutations to investigate the phenotypic effect of loss of the D 1 gene. In contrast to a previous report, I determined that the D 1 gene is not essential for viability of Drosophila melanogaster, and moreover, that loss of D 1 has no obvious phenotypic effects. My tests for an effect of D 1 mutations on PEV revealed {{that it is not}} a suppressor of variegation, as concluded by other investigators. In fact, the consequence of loss of D 1 on one of six variegating rearrangements tested, T(2; 3) SbV, was dominant enhancement of PEV, suggesting a role for the protein in euchromatic chromatin structure and/or transcription. A study of D 1 protein sequence conservation highlighted features shared with mammalian HMGA proteins, which function as architectural transcription factors...|$|R

40|$|These studies address whether XIST RNA is {{properly}} localized to the X chromosome in somatic cells where human XIST expression is reactivated, but fails {{to result in}} X inactivation (Tinker, A. V., and C. J. Brown. 1998. Nucl. Acids Res. 26 : 2935 - 2940). Despite a nuclear RNA accumulation of normal abundance and stability, XIST RNA does not localize in reactivants or in naturally inactive human X chromosomes in mouse/ human hybrid cells. The XIST transcripts are fully stabilized despite their inability to localize, and hence XIST RNA localization can be uncoupled from stabilization, indicating that these are separate steps controlled by distinct mechanisms. Mouse Xist RNA tightly localized to an active X chromosome, demonstrating {{for the first time}} that the active X chromosome in somatic cells is competent to associate with Xist RNA. These results imply that species-specific factors, present even in mature, somatic cells that do not normally express Xist, are necessary for localization. When Xist RNA {{is properly}} localized to an active mouse X chromosome, X inactivation does not result. Therefore, there is not a strict correlation between Xist localization and chromatin inactivation. Moreover, expression, stabilization, and localization of Xist RNA are not sufficient for X inactivation. We hypothesize that <b>chromosomal</b> <b>association</b> of XIST RNA may initiate subsequent developmental events required to enact transcriptional silencing...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Sister {{chromatid}} cohesion {{depends on}} a complex called cohesin, which contains at least four subunits: Smc 1, Smc 3, Scc 1 and Scc 3. Cohesion is established during DNA replication, is partially dismantled in many, but not all, organisms during prophase, and is finally destroyed at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. A quite separate protein called Spo 76 is required for sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis in the ascomycete Sordaria. Spo 76 -like proteins are highly conserved amongst eukaryotes and a homologue in Aspergillus nidulans, called BimD, {{is required for the}} completion of mitosis. The isolation of the cohesin subunit Smc 3 as a suppressor of BimD mutations suggests that Spo 76 /BimD might function in the same process as cohesin. Results: We show here that the yeast homologue of Spo 76, called Pds 5, is essential for establishing sister chromatid cohesion and maintaining it during metaphase. We also show that Pds 5 co-localizes with cohesin on chromosomes, that the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>association</b> of Pds 5 and cohesin is interdependent, that Scc 1 recruits Pds 5 to chromosomes in G 1 and that its cleavage causes dissociation of Pds 5 from chromosomes at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Conclusions: Our data show that Pds 5 functions as part of the same process as cohesin. Sequence similarities and secondary structure predictions indicate that Pds 5 consists of tandemly repeated HEAT repeats, and might therefore function as a protein–protein interaction scaffold, possibly in the cohesin–DNA complex assembly...|$|E
40|$|The cohesin complex, {{which is}} {{essential}} for sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome segregation, also inhibits resolution of sister chromatid intertwinings (SCIs) by the topoisomerase Top 2. The cohesin-related Smc 5 / 6 complex (Smc 5 / 6) instead accumulates on chromosomes after Top 2 inactivation, known {{to lead to a}} buildup of unresolved SCIs. This suggests that cohesin can influence the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>association</b> of Smc 5 / 6 via its role in SCI protection. Using high-resolution ChIP-sequencing, we show that the localization of budding yeast Smc 5 / 6 to duplicated chromosomes indeed depends on sister chromatid cohesion in wild-type and top 2 - 4 cells. Smc 5 / 6 is found to be enriched at cohesin binding sites in the centromere-proximal regions in both cell types, but also along chromosome arms when replication has occurred under Top 2 -inhibiting conditions. Reactivation of Top 2 after replication causes Smc 5 / 6 to dissociate from chromosome arms, supporting the assumption that Smc 5 / 6 associates with a Top 2 substrate. It is also demonstrated that the amount of Smc 5 / 6 on chromosomes positively correlates with the level of missegregation in top 2 - 4, and that Smc 5 / 6 promotes segregation of short chromosomes in the mutant. Altogether, this shows that the chromosomal localization of Smc 5 / 6 predicts the presence of the chromatid segregation-inhibiting entities which accumulate in top 2 - 4 mutated cells. These are most likel...|$|E
40|$|The {{cellular}} {{response to}} glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation involves a highly orchestrated series of regulatory actions influenced at multiple levels {{by a variety}} of mechanisms including the action of transcription factors and chromatin modifiers. Because the majority of GR binding sites (glucocorticoid-responsive elements (GREs)) are distant from promoters, it is likely that interactions at a distance {{play an important role in}} GR action. To determine whether long range <b>chromosomal</b> <b>associations</b> play a role in transcription regulation by GR, we utilized a chromosome conformation capture-based technique (associated chromosome trap) to identify unknown, remote sequences that interact with the GR-induced Lipocalin 2 (Lcn 2) gene. Our screen revealed that the Lcn 2 GRE interacts with the Ciz 1 gene, nearly 30 kb upstream. Ciz 1 was subsequently found to be a novel GR-responsive gene. The GRE proximal to the Lcn 2 promoter apparently functions to regulate both the Lcn 2 gene and the distal Ciz 1 gene. Using quantitative chromosome conformation capture, we find that a loop structure is organized between these two genes. This structure is hormone-independent and present only in cell types where the genes are active. The strong correlation between gene expression and loop structure in different cell lines suggests that high order interactions play a role in determining tissue-specific gene regulation...|$|R
40|$|Several meiotic {{processes}} ensure faithful {{chromosome segregation}} to create haploid gametes. Errors {{to any one}} of these processes can lead to zygotic aneuploidy with the potential for developmental abnormalities. During prophase I of Drosophila male meiosis, each bivalent condenses and becomes sequestered into discrete chromosome territories. Here, we demonstrate that two predicted condensin II subunits, Cap-H 2 and Cap-D 3, are required to promote territory formation. In mutants of either subunit, territory formation fails and chromatin is dispersed throughout the nucleus. Anaphase I is also abnormal in Cap-H 2 mutants as chromatin bridges are found between segregating heterologous and homologous chromosomes. Aneuploid sperm may be generated from these defects as they occur at an elevated frequency and are genotypically consistent with anaphase I segregation defects. We propose that condensin II-mediated prophase I territory formation prevents and/or resolves heterologous <b>chromosomal</b> <b>associations</b> to alleviate their potential interference in anaphase I segregation. Furthermore, condensin II-catalyzed prophase I chromosome condensation may be necessary to resolve associations between paired homologous chromosomes of each bivalent. These persistent chromosome associations likely consist of DNA entanglements, but may be more specific as anaphase I bridging was rescued by mutations in the homolog conjunction factor teflon. We propose that the consequence of condensin II mutations is a failure to resolve heterologous and homologous associations mediated by entangled DNA and/or homolog conjunction factors. Furthermore, persistence of homologous and heterologous interchromosomal associations lead to anaphase I chromatin bridging and the generation of aneuploid gametes...|$|R
