40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{document}} the prevalence and socio-demographic correlates of time spent cooking by adults in the 2005 UK Time-Use Survey. Respondents reported their main activities, in 10 minute slots, throughout one 24 hour period. Activities were coded into 30 pre-defined codes, including ‘cooking, washing up’. Four measures of time spent cooking were calculated: any time spent <b>cooking,</b> 30 <b>continuous</b> minutes spent <b>cooking,</b> total time spent <b>cooking,</b> and longest <b>continuous</b> time spent <b>cooking.</b> Socio-demographic correlates were: age, employment, social class, education, and number of adults {{and children in the}} household. Analyses were stratified by gender. Data from 4214 participants were included. 85 % of women and 60 % of men spent any time cooking; 60 % of women and 33 % of men spent 30 <b>continuous</b> minutes <b>cooking.</b> Amongst women, older age, not being in employment, lower social class, greater education, and living with other adults or children were positively associated with time cooking. Few differences in time spent cooking were seen in men. Socio-economic differences in time spent cooking may have been overstated as a determinant of socio-economic differences in diet, overweight and obesity. Gender was a stronger determinant of time spent cooking than other socio-demographic variables...|$|R

50|$|In {{the middle}} on the 1930s, Kamyr {{launched}} their new process for continuous bleaching {{that was developed}} and patented by Richter. The company had an immediate success initially in Europe and later worldwide. Kamyr grew quickly and obtained the necessary resources and creditability for innovations to come.Richter already had a vision to introduce a process for <b>continuous</b> <b>cooking</b> of pulp. So far this had been done in batches, with its drawback in quality variance and being a barrier to rational nonstop production of paper. So far nobody had even tried to conquer this area and {{it proved to be}} way more complicated than with bleaching. It took more than 10 years from the first pilot in 1940 to a fully operational unit. Richter always insisted on full scale testing. “You can fool a man, but not a machine. When the machine is willful, you have to find out why”. The first installation was able to produce 30 tons per day. A Richter digester of today will produce more than 2500 tons per day.He became the CEO of Kamyr in 1950 while still being directly responsible for Research and Development. In the following years Kamyr obtains more or less a monopoly position as no other supplier was capable of presenting something similar. Paper mills all over the world switched to continuous uninterrupted production of pulp and paper which created considerable savings and a stable quality of the end-product.|$|E

40|$|Eucalyptus globulus wood {{originating}} from plantations in Uruguay {{was subjected to}} <b>continuous</b> batch kraft <b>cooking</b> (CBC), applying mill-like conditions. Pulp samples were taken {{at different stages of}} CBC cooking being representative for all three cooking phases. The residual lignin was successfully isolated in a reasonable yield by a new method, the dissolved wood lignin (DWL) protocol, which is based on the total dissolution of ball milled wood and pulp samples in dimethylsulfoxide and N-methylimidazole (DMSO/NMI) followed by precipitation in dioxane/ water to separate lignin and carbohydrate fractions. For comparative reasons, the lignin was also isolated by a conventional mild acidolysis (AL) method. Extensive structural lignin characterization using 1 D and 2 D NMR revealed that the DWL protocol allows the isolation of less altered lignin than the AL method. During bulk and residual delignification, the S/G ratio of lignin remaining in the fibers continuously decreased, while the content of -O- 4 units and phenolic OH groups remained almost unaffected, suggesting that the CBC process permits enhanced delignification efficiency and good bleachability...|$|R
40|$|Studies on {{strength}} {{delivery and}} related fields {{have so far}} concentrated on finding the locations in the mill where fibres are damaged and what the damages consist of. However, fibres will invariably encounter mechanical stresses along the fibreline and in this thesis a new concept is introduced; the vulnerability of fibres to mechanical treatment. It is hypothesised that fibres with different properties have different abilities to withstand the mechanical forces they endure as they are discharged from the digester and transported through valves, pumps and various washing and bleaching equipment. In the thesis, results are presented from trials where pulps with significantly different hemicellulose compositions were high-intensity mixed at pH 13, 70 °C and 10 % pulp consistency and pulp strength evaluated. By varying alkalinity and temperature, pulps with different carbohydrate composition could be obtained. High alkali concentration and low temperature resulted in high glucomannan content and low xylan content, whereas cooking at low alkali concentration and high temperature rendered a pulp with low glucomannan and high xylan content. The high alkalinity pulp was stronger, determined as tear index at given tensile index. The pulp viscosity was also higher for this pulp. However, when the pulps were subjected to high-intensity mixing, the high alkalinity pulp lost in tear strength and the re-wetted zero-span tensile strength was substantially reduced. The pulp cooked at high alkalinity was thus interpreted as being more vulnerable to mechanical treatment than the pulp obtained by cooking at low alkalinity. Another pair of pulps was manufactured at high and low sodium ion concentrations, but otherwise with similar chemical charges. The pulp obtained by cooking at low sodium ion concentration became stronger, evaluated as tear index at a given tensile index and the curl index was substantially lower, 8 % compared to 12 % for the pulp cooked at a high sodium ion concentration. The viscosity was 170 ml/g higher for the pulp manufactured at low sodium ion concentration. When the pulps were subjected to high-intensity mixing, the tear strength of the pulp manufactured at high sodium ion concentration was reduced. The re-wetted zero-span tensile index decreased also after mixing. The pulp obtained by cooking at higher sodium ion concentration was thus interpreted as being more vulnerable to mechanical treatment than the pulp manufactured at lower sodium ion concentration. In the thesis, two reasons for the low strength delivery of industrially produced pulps compared to laboratory-cooked pulps are put forward. Since the ionic strength of mill cooking liquor systems {{is much higher than}} is normally used in laboratory cooking, this can partly explain the difference in strength between mill- and laboratory-cooked pulp. A higher sodium ion concentration was shown in this thesis work to give a pulp of lower strength. Secondly, it is suggested that the difference in retention time of the black liquor in laboratory <b>cooking</b> and <b>continuous</b> mill <b>cooking</b> systems can explain the difference in tensile strength between laboratory-cooked and mill-produced pulp. The black liquor in a continuous digester has a longer retention time in the digester than the chips. This gives a longer time for the dissolved xylan to degrade and, as a consequence, the xylan deposited on the mill pulp fibres will be more degraded than the xylan deposited on the laboratory-cooked pulp fibres. In the thesis, results are also presented from studies using different strength-enhancing chemicals. The fibre surfaces of bleached never-dried and once-dried pulp were modified by the polyelectrolyte multilayer technique using cationic and anionic starch. Although the pulps absorbed the same amount of starch, the never-dried pulp reached a higher tensile index than the once-dried pulp. When the starch-treated never-dried pulp was dried and reslushed it still had higher tensile index than the never-dried untreated pulp. The starch layers were thus able to counteract part of the hornification effect. The never-dried starch treated pulps were subsequently dried, reslushed and beaten. Pulp with starch layers had a better beatability evaluated as the tensile index obtained after given number of PFI revolutions than dried untreated pulp. Hence, there is a potential to increase the tensile index of market pulp by utilising the polyelectrolyte multilayer technique before drying. Addition of CMC to bleached mill pulp and laboratory-cooked pulp increased the tensile strength to the same degree for both pulps. CMC addition had a straightening effect on the fibres, the shape factor increased and this increased the zero-span tensile strength also. QC 2010051...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{studied the}} {{possibility}} of using the whole stalk kenaf as a raw material for producing high yield and good quality bleachable pulp. The stem of kenaf has two distinct parts: the bast and the core. which have markedly different chemical components and fiber morphology. In general, the length of bast fiber ranges from about 2 - 2. 5 mm, while that of the core varies from about 0. 5 - 0. 8 mm, so it is important to achieve a balance of the bast fiber and the core during pulping. The study indicated that using the selected <b>continuous</b> <b>cooking</b> conditions, the properties of kenaf pulp approached to the hardwood pulp and would be easily bleached...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Quality and {{economical}} requirements have raised evident need {{and interest in}} the industry to further develop continuous kraft cooking. A Kappa number, representing the cooking degree, {{is one of the}} few quality measures of cooking, and usually the only one measured on-line. Cooking degree is mainly controlled by temperature, chemical charge, and cooking time. Cooking conditions strongly depend on the packing degree of a chip column in the digester. At the same time, the packing of a chip column is affected by the cooking degree of chips. A typical problem is that the conditions and cooking degree in the process are not known. To achieve better control, more information about the cooking process is required. The aim of this thesis has been to more accurately describe the cooking conditions and phenomena in the digester scale. Conventional and Downflow Lo-Solids™ <b>continuous</b> <b>cooking</b> processes, producing both softwood and hardwood pulp, were investigated. Information achieved from measurements, and physical and chemical models describing chip scale phenomena, were utilised. Kappa number modelling was based on the use of an optimised and on-line adapted Gustafson's model. Modelling over grade change situations was accomplished by smoothly adjusting the model parameters as a function of temperature change profiles. Real-time profiles of cooking chemicals, temperature, and lignin and carbohydrates contents of chips within the processes were modelled. These real-time profiles were utilised in the modelling of the chip column's packing degree in the conventional process. Based on the developed models, blow-line Kappa numbers of both processes were predicted. By exploiting the prediction results, a new control strategy for the Kappa number was developed. In the strategy, set points for chemical charge and cooking temperature are iteratively solved by using only the developed prediction models of the blow-line Kappa number. It was shown that the modelled profiles of wood components and cooking chemicals can give new information regarding the <b>continuous</b> <b>cooking</b> processes. The modelling results are feasible in control purposes, and they also can support the operators' work. In the new control strategy, compared to the widely used H-factor based control, chemical concentrations can be more precisely taken into account...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the mathematical modeling and simulation of the steady-state operation of an industrial moving bed heterogeneous reactor for the kraft pulping of Eucalyptus globulus. The cooking takes place in a single-vessel hydraulic digester adapted for isothermal cooking (ITC), a further development of the modified <b>continuous</b> <b>cooking</b> (MCC) process. A heterogeneous model is used {{to take into account the}} different phases, each with distinct profiles of temperature and concentration of organic (lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose) and inorganic (effective alkali and sulfide) compounds. The numerical solution of the model is based on a non-uniform discretization strategy to cope with special geometric and operational features of the digester. The decrease in bulk porosity caused by the compaction of the bed and the progressive increase in the voidage of chips as a result of chemical reactions are incorporated into the model as well as the resulting implications in the entrapped and free liquor flows. The model presented here can be used in optimization studies and has been validated with data from an industrial mill. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the iron content of Malawian foods prepared in iron pots and to examine the effects of <b>continuous</b> <b>cooking</b> time and added oil on the iron content of the food prepared. Foods prepared, which included a staple (Nsima), relish vegetables, and beans, had an increased iron content when prepared in an iron compared to a glass pot. For these three foods, iron content per gram increased by 3. 15 micrograms, 35. 8 micrograms, and 147. 32 micrograms, respectively. Continuous use of the iron pot for cooking could have a positive effect on the amount of iron added to the food, as the three foods' iron content increased by a further 2. 9 micrograms iron/g, 7. 6 micrograms iron/g and 20. 1 micrograms iron/g, respectively. This effect needs more study. Food pH was significantly negatively correlated with food iron content. The use of oil reduced the amount of iron added to stir-fried vegetables by 52. 37 micrograms/g and increased iron added to Nsima (1. 2 micrograms/g). Malawian foods increased their iron content when cooked in iron pots. This method of food preparation potentially provides a low-cost sustainable means of improving the iron intakes of families and communities where this traditional method of food preparation is acceptable...|$|E
40|$|The {{white rot}} fungus Trametes (Coriolus) versicolor can delignify and {{brighten}} unbleached hardwood kraft pulp {{within a few}} days, but softwood kraft pulps require longer treatment. To determine the contributions of higher residual lignin contents (kappa numbers) and structural differences in lignins to the recalcitrance of softwood kraft pulps to biobleaching, we tested softwood and hardwood pulps cooked to the same kappa numbers, 26 and 12. A low-lignin-content (overcooked) softwood pulp resisted delignification by T. versicolor, but a high-lignin-content (lightly cooked) hardwood pulp was delignified {{at the same rate}} as a normal softwood pulp. Thus, the longer time taken by T. versicolor to brighten softwood kraft pulp than hardwood pulp results from the higher residual lignin content of the softwood pulp; possible differences in the structures of the residual lignins are important only when the lignin becomes highly condensed. Under the conditions used in this study, when an improved fungal inoculum was used, six different softwood pulps were all substantially brightened by T. versicolor. Softwood pulps whose lignin contents were decreased by extended modified <b>continuous</b> <b>cooking</b> or oxygen delignification to kappa numbers as low as 15 were delignified by T. versicolor {{at the same rate as}} normal softwood pulp. More intensive O 2 delignification, like overcooking, decreased the susceptibility of the residual lignin in the pulps to degradation by T. versicolor...|$|E
40|$|This work {{focused on}} {{modeling}} of the chip bed packing phenomena {{in a continuous}} kraft cooking digester. A better understanding of chip bed packing would {{make it possible to}} optimize chip flow conditions in the digester, thereby ensuring uniform fiber quality and production efficiency. Chips are fed continuously into the digester, with the chip flow forming a solid bed. As the solid chip bed moves slowly downwards, cooking reactions proceed, which leads to softening of the chips. The softening of chips and the process conditions, flows and gravitational, are major variables affecting the chip bed packing. A new computer model, TKK Packing Simulator, was created to study the chip bed packing in a continuous digester. The simulator was verified against mill-scale conditions by conducting measurements in a <b>continuous</b> <b>cooking</b> plant. The packing simulator was found to give an accurate picture of the process flows inside the continuous digester. As digesters have grown bigger, controlling the liquor flows in the chip bed has become increasingly important. A tracer test was used to verify the liquor flow, which can be far from ideal in a modern digester. It is important to have optimal packing and flow conditions inside the digester, because too high packing and channeling of the liquor flow leads to non-uniform cooking, production disturbances and impaired fiber quality. The simulator developed in the present research can be used to determine optimal packing and flow conditions...|$|E
40|$|Solid-state and {{solution}} NMR technique, {{were used}} in order to study the transformation of various functional groups present in lignin and cellulose when wood is exposed {{to a wide range}} of pH's and pulping reagents. Solid-state proton spin-lattice relaxation times (T 1 H) allowed the determination of the molecular mobilities of carbohydrates and lignin as a function of PH for black spruce softwood. Similar measurements on isolated cellulose and cuoxam lignin were also conducted. These studies showed that the mobilities of the polymeric constituents of wood are affected by ionization processes occurring on the various functional groups present in lignin and cellulose. Quantitative 31 P NMR Spectroscopy was also used to derive the fundamental thermodynamic parameters that are involved in the stereoselective degradation of the two diastereomeric forms of the most abundant structural (arylglycerol-beta-aryl ether) units of lignin under kraft pulping conditions. It was shown that the erythro isomers of the arylglycerol-beta-aryl ether units in softwood milled wood lignin cleave faster than their threo counterparts. The general stability of the threo diastereomers toward kraft pulping seems to be the manifestation of a considerably slower reaction of the pulping reagents with the threo diastereomers of arylglycerol-beta-aryl ethers. Quantitative 31 P NMR Was also used for the identification and quantification of accumulated condensed diphenyimethane (DPW moieties during conventional kraft, extended modified <b>continuous</b> <b>cooking</b> (EMCCRTM) and soda pulping processes. A novel method that permits the quantitative detection and classification of various carbonyls in lignin was also developed. The proposed selective fluoride-induced trifluoromethylation method was optimized for a series of carbonyl-containing lignin-like model compounds. This was followed by 19 F NMR spectral analyses of the resulting fluorine derivatives allowing for thorough understanding of their structure/ 19 F NMR chemical shift relationships' our studies demonstrated that the Proposed method is a new analytical tool for the classification and quantification of various carbonyl groups that may be present in soluble lignins...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2005. At SAPPI-Tugela a {{continuous}} Kraft wood chip digester operates in EMCC mode (extended modified <b>continuous</b> <b>cooking).</b> Chips are initially {{exposed to a}} NaOH / Na 2 S liquor at high temperature in the top section. The chips move downward in plug flow passing circumferential screens used to draw liquor for various circulations. About midway down the spent black liquor is removed and the chips enter the cooler bottom section where some further reaction and washing occurs. Liquor level and chip level are maintained {{close to each other}} near the top. Chips require 8 - 12 hours to pass through the digester, depending on the chip feed rate. The key parameter of interest at the digester exit is the Kappa number, which {{is a measure of the}} extent of delignification which has occurred. Different board and paper products require different Kappa number pulp feed. (Final properties such as tensile, tear and bursting strengths will also depend on the way fibres have been modified in the digestion). The objective of this investigation is to predict the Kappa number of the product pulp in real-time, thus facilitating quicker reaction than the present dependence on laboratory analysis permits, possibly even allowing closed-loop control. The extent of delignification depends on liquor strength, temperature and exposure time, with final Kappa number also depending on the properties of the chip feed (wood type and moisture content). Compensation to maintain a steady Kappa number is made difficult by the long and varying residence time, and the fact that any changes apply to the whole profile held up in the digester. A number of static models for Kappa number prediction have been developed by previous workers, but these do not compare well with plant measurements. The collection of data from the Sappi-Tugela reactor, and the pulp quality reports, have been used to determine an efficient model. This step required a considerable data collection exercise, and similar results to the quality reports have been obtained using a simple linear model based on this data. The problem of model error is being reduced by arrangement as a Smith Predictor, in which the model is intermittently corrected by available laboratory analyses. At the same time, an interface was created, in order to synchronise measurement data for the chips presently leaving the reactor. In order to deal with the dead time, each parcel of chips entering the reactor is effectively tracked, and the changes in Kappa number integrated for reaction time under the varying conditions in transit. Knowing the present inventory of the reactor, this model can also be run forward in time as a predictive controller, to determine optimal control actions for maintenance of the target Kappa number...|$|E
