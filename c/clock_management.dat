He scored a {{touchdown}} on a quarterback sneak with six minutes to go, and tied the game with a touchdown pass to Neal Anderson with 1:28 to go. The Buccaneers allowed seven sacks, but led for most of the game. The Bears were aided by the Buccaneers' poor <b>clock</b> <b>management</b> and their reliance on a conservative offense in the fourth quarter. Perkins denied accusations that they went to a prevent defense and a three-man rush, but admitted that they played too conservatively on defense at the end. Steve DeBerg threw touchdown passes to Calvin Magee and Jeff Smith on the Buccaneers' first two possessions. On the Bears' next possession, Ron Holmes' hit on Mike Tomczak forced a fumble that was recovered in the end zone by Winston Moss to give the Buccaneers a 20–0 lead. The Bears scored two quick touchdowns in the second quarter, but the Buccaneers extended their lead with two Donald Igwebuike field goals. With the Bears struggling on offense, McMahon was inserted into the game. McMahon was 12 of 14 for 144yards and led the Bears to 156yards of offense in the last two drives, compared with 142 in the first 50minutes of the game.

Moreover, for compactness, the chips must be embedded inside the detector making crucial the reduction of the power consumption to 10 µWatt per channel.

HARDROC readout is a semi-digital readout with two or three thresholds (2 or 3 bits readout respectively in hardroc 1 and hardroc 2) which allows both good tracking and coarse energy measurement, and also integrates on chip data storage. The 64 channels of the 2 nd prototype, HARDROC 2, are made of: • Fast low impedance preamplifier with a variable gain over 8 bits per channel • A variable slow shaper (50 - 150 ns) and Track and Hold to provide a multiplexed analog charge output up to 15 pC. • 3 variable gain fast shapers followed by 3 low offset discriminators to autotrig down to 10 fC up to 10 pC.

40|$|Abstract — Process {{variations}} cause design {{performance to}} become unpredictable in deep sub-micron technologies. Several statistical techniques (timing analysis, gate-sizing, buffer insertion) {{have been proposed}} to counter these variations during the optimization phase of the design flow to get better timing yields. Another interesting approach to improve timing yield is post-silicon tunable (PST) clock-tree. However, gate sizing and PST <b>clock</b> tree <b>management</b> have not been integrated together into a single framework for better optimization. In this work, we propose such an integrated framework that performs simultaneous statistical gatesizing in presence of PST clock-tree buffers for minimizing binningyield loss (BYL) and tunability costs by determining the ranges of tuning to be provided at each buffer. To our best knowledge, there is no work in the current literature that tries to look at such an integrated variability-driven framework. The simultaneous gatesizing and PST buffer range determination problem is {{proved to be a}} convex stochastic programming formulation under longest path delay constraints and hence solved optimally. We further extend the formulation into a heuristic to additionally consider shortest path delay constraints. We make experimental comparisons using nominal gate sizing followed by PST buffer management using [13] as a base-case. We take the solution obtained from this approach and perform 1) Sensitivity-based statistical gate-sizing while retaining the PST clock tree 2) Simultaneous gate sizing and PST buffer range determination as proposed in this work. On an average, the BYL obtained from our approach is 98 % lower than the base-case ([13]) and 95 % lower than the sensitivity-based algorithm. On an average the base-case approach ([13] gave 22 % timing yield loss (YL), the sensitivity approach gave 19 % YL, where as our proposed algorithm gave only 3 % YL. The total PST tuning buffer range that is allocated through the proposed algorithm is comparable to that obtained from [13]. The proposed algorithm had a 2. 2 x runtime speedup compared to the sensitivity-based algorithm. I...|$|R

The ever-increasing chip size and speed call for new methodologies in clock distribution network. Conventional global synchronization techniques exhibit many drawbacks in the advanced VLSI chips such as high-speed microprocessors. A significant {{percentage of the total}} power consumption in a microprocessor is dissipated in the clock distribution network. Also since the chip dimensions increase, <b>clock</b> skew <b>management</b> becomes very challenging in the framework of conventional methodology. Long interconnect delays limit the maximum clock frequency and become a bottleneck for future microprocessor design. In such a situation, new alternative techniques for synchronization in system-on-chip are demanded. This thesis presents new alternatives for traditional clocking and synchronization methods, in which, speed and power consumption bottlenecks are treated. For this purpose, two new techniques based on mesochronous synchronization and resonant clocking are investigated. The mesochronous synchronization technique deals with remedies for skew and delay management. Using this technique, clock frequency up to 5 GHz for on-chip communication is achievable in 0. 18 -μm CMOS process. On the other hand the resonant clocking solves significant power dissipation problem in the clock network. This method shows a great potential in power saving in very large-scale integrated circuits. According to measurements, 2. 3 X power saving in clock distribution network is achieved in 130 -nm CMOS process. In the resonant clocking, oscillator plays a crucial role as a clock generator. Therefore an investigation about oscillators and possible techniques for jitter and phase noise reduction in clock generators has been done in this research framework. For this purpose a study of injection locking phenomenon in ring oscillators is presented. This phenomenon {{can be used as a}} jitter suppression mechanism in the oscillators. Also a new implementation of the DLL-based clock generators using ring oscillators is presented in 130 -nm CMOS process.

We give some examples of such protocols and we show a useful methodology which can be used to break many protocols. In particular, we break a protocol that is being standardized by the ISO. We present a new authenticated exchange protocol which is both provably secsre and highly efficient and practical. The security of the protocol is proven, based on an assumption about the the cryptosystem employed (namely, that it is secure when used in CBC mode on a certain message space). We think that this assumption is quite reasonable for many cryptosystems, and furthermore it is often assumed in practical use of the DES cryptosystem. Our protocol cannot be broken using the methodology we present (which was strong enough to catch all protocol flaws we found). The reduction to the security of the encryption mode, indeed captures the non-existence of the exposures that the methodology catches (specialized to the actual use of encryption in our protocol). Furthermore, the protocol prevents chosen plaintext or ciphertext attacks on the cryptosystem. The proposed protocol is efficient and practical in several aspects.

30|$|Several lifting-based 2 -D DWT {{multi-level}} architectures {{have been}} suggested for efficient VLSI implementation[3, 8 – 15] that take into consideration various aspects like memory, power, and speed. These architectures can be classified as folded architectures[8], parallel architectures[14], and recursive architectures[16]. Andra et al.[8] proposed simple folded architecture to perform several stages of 2 -D DWT {{with the help of}} memory. Systolic architecture is proposed by Huang et al.[9] for a DWT filter with finite length. Multi-level 2 -D DWT decomposition is implemented by recursive architecture (RA)[10, 16], but these approaches demand large amount of frame buffers to store the intermediate LL output and also require complex control path. Wu and Lin[3] proposed folded scheme, where multi-level DWT computation is performed level by level, with memory and single processing element. Unlike RA, folded architecture uses simple control circuitry, and it has 100 % hardware utilization efficiency (HUE). Folded architectures consist of memory and a pair of 1 -D DWT modules, a row processing unit (RPU) and a column processing unit (CPU). Mohanty and Meher[12] proposed a multi-level architecture for high throughput with more number of adders and multipliers. Xiong et al.[13] proposed two line-based high-speed architectures by employing parallel and pipelining techniques, which can perform j-level decomposition for N[*]×[*]N image in approximate 2 (1 [*]-[*] 4 -j)N 2 / 3 and (1 [*]-[*] 4 -j)N 2 / 3 clock cycles. Hsia et al.[17] have proposed a symmetric mask-based scheme to compute 2 -D integer lifting DWT, where the separate mask is used for each sub-band. Mask-based algorithms do not require temporal buffers, but they are not suitable for area efficient implementation due to a large number of adder and multiplier requirement. A memory efficient architecture is proposed by Lai et al.[4] with low latency. Al-Sulaifanie et al.[18] designed an architecture, which is independent of input image size with moderate speed and HUE. Recently, Aziz and Pham[15] have proposed parallel architecture for lifting (5, 3) multi-level 2 -D DWT with a single processing unit to calculate both predict and update values. But this architecture requires 4 N line buffers for single-level decomposition and has less HUE due to the wastage of the alternate <b>clock</b> cycle.

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} transistor shrinkage {{and higher}} clock frequencies are causing serious <b>clock</b> distribution, power <b>management,</b> and reliability issues. Asynchronous design {{is predicted to}} have a significant role in tackling these challenges because of its distributed control mechanism and on-demand, rather than continuous, switching activity. Null Convention Logic (NCL) is a robust and low-power asynchronous paradigm that introduces new challenges to test and testability algorithms because 1) the lack of deterministic timing in NCL complicates the management of test timing, 2) all NCL gates are state-holding and even simple combinational circuits show sequential behaviour, and 3) stuck-at faults on gate internal feedback (GIF) of NCL gates do not always cause an incorrect output and therefore are undetectable by automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) algorithms. Existing test methods for NCL use clocked hardware to control the timing of test. Such test hardware could introduce metastability issues into otherwise highly robust NCL devices. Also, existing test techniques for NCL handle the high-statefulness of NCL circuits by excessive incorporation of test hardware which imposes additional area, propagation delay and power consumption. This work, first, proposes a clockless self-timed ATPG that detects all faults on the gate inputs and a share of the GIF faults with no added design for test (DFT). Then, the efficacy of quiescent current (IDDQ) test for detecting GIF faults undetectable by a DFT-less ATPG is investigated. Finally, asynchronous test hardware, including test points, a scan cell, and an interleaved scan architecture, is proposed for NCL-based circuits. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first work that develops clockless, self-timed test techniques for NCL while minimising the need for DFT, and also the first work conducted on IDDQ test of NCL. The proposed methods are applied to multiple NCL circuits with up to 2, 633 NCL gates (10, 000 CMOS Boolean gates), in 180 and 45 nm technologies and show average fault coverage of 88. 98 % for ATPG alone, 98. 52 % including IDDQ test, and 99. 28 % when incorporating test hardware. Given that this fault coverage includes detection of GIF faults, our work has 13 % higher fault coverage than previous work. Also, because our proposed clockless test hardware eliminates the need for double-latching, it reduces the average area and delay overhead of previous studies by 32 % and 50 %, respectively...|$|R
