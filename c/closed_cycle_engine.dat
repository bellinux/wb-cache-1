40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors compare and {{contrast}} open and closed-cycle heat engines. First of all, by way of example and to aid discussion, the performance of proprietary externally heated closed-cycle Stirling engines is {{compared with that of}} internally heated open Otto <b>cycle</b> <b>engines.</b> Both types of engine have disadvantages and merits and this suggested that in order to accommodate the best of both engine types an externally-heated open-cycle engine might offer a more satisfactory solution for small-scale combined heat and power (CHP) systems.

5000|$|The final {{classification}} is the gas-core engine. This is {{a modification}} to the liquid-core design which uses rapid circulation of the fluid {{to create a}} toroidal pocket of gaseous uranium fuel {{in the middle of}} the reactor, surrounded by hydrogen. In this case the fuel does not touch the reactor wall at all, so temperatures could reach several tens of thousands of degrees, which would allow specific impulses of 3000 to 5000 seconds (30 to 50 kN·s/kg). In this basic design, the [...] "open cycle", the losses of nuclear fuel would be difficult to control, which has led to studies of the [...] "closed cycle" [...] or nuclear lightbulb engine, where the gaseous nuclear fuel is contained in a super-high-temperature quartz container, over which the hydrogen flows. The <b>closed</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>engine</b> actually has much more in common with the solid-core design, but this time is limited by the critical temperature of quartz instead of the fuel stack. Although less efficient than the open-cycle design, the closed-cycle design is expected to deliver a specific impulse of about 1500-2000 seconds (15 - 20 kN·s/kg).|$|E

40|$|NASA Lewis Research Center {{is testing}} the world's first {{integrated}} solar dynamic power {{system in a}} simulated space environment. This system converts solar thermal energy into electrical energy by using a closed-cycle gas turbine and alternator. A NASA-developed analysis code called the <b>Closed</b> <b>Cycle</b> <b>Engine</b> Program (CCEP) {{has been used for}} both pretest predictions and post-test analysis of system performance. The solar dynamic power system has a reflective concentrator that focuses solar thermal energy into a cavity receiver. The receiver is a heat exchanger that transfers the thermal power to a working fluid, an inert gas mixture of helium and xenon. The receiver also uses a phase-change material to store the thermal energy so that the system can continue producing power when there is no solar input power, such as when an Earth-orbiting satellite is in eclipse. The system uses a recuperated closed Brayton cycle to convert thermal power to mechanical power. Heated gas from the receiver expands through a turbine that turns an alternator and a compressor. The system also includes a gas cooler and a radiator, which reject waste cycle heat, and a recuperator, a gas-to-gas heat exchanger that improves cycle efficiency by recovering thermal energy...|$|E

Input variables for a potential design point included the number of operating units (1, 2, 4), cycle peak pressure (0. 5, 1, 2 MPa), and turbo-alternator shaft speed (30, 45, 60 kRPM).

40|$|One form {{of power}} {{conversion}} under consideration in NASA Glenn Research Center's Thermal Energy Conversion Branch is the closed-Brayton-cycle engine. In the tens-of-kilowatts to multimegawatt class, the Brayton engine {{lends itself to}} potential space nuclear power applications such as electric propulsion or surface power. The Thermal Energy Conversion Branch has most recently concentrated its Brayton studies on electric propulsion for Prometheus. One piece of software used for evaluating such designs over a limited tradeoff space has been the <b>Closed</b> <b>Cycle</b> <b>Engine</b> Program (CCEP). The CCEP originated in the mid- 1980 s from a Fortran aircraft engine code known as the Navy/NASA Engine Program (NNEP).

40|$|Abstract — Expendable Launch {{vehicles}} {{remain the}} primary means of delivering payloads to orbit. 1 2 High reliability in these systems {{is vital to the}} safe delivery of the valuable payloads they carry. A considerable number of past launch vehicle failures can be attributed to propulsion subsystems. These subsystems contain combustion, control thrust levels, maintain vehicle stability, and withstand the dynamic loads associated with these processes. The high levels of complexity associated with propulsion subsystems often provide opportunities for failure. It is crucial for launch vehicle providers to utilize reliable and robust propulsion systems to propel customer payloads to their final destination. Reliability is enhanced by establishing a mature design and is proven by demonstrating performance through testing and flight. Propulsion system improvements are inherent to any program where the ultimate goal is technical excellence and high reliability. The Atlas launch vehicle’s main booster engine, the RD- 180, has demonstrated consistent performance with predictable environments over the past decade. The RD- 180 has substantially contributed to the established a record of high reliability on Atlas launch vehicles since its debut on the Atlas III in May of 2000. The RD- 180 is a LOx rich, closed cycle, staged combustion, LOx Kerosene engine, with throttle capability from 47 % to 100 % power level. The <b>closed</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>engine</b> with continuous throttling provides an unprecedented advantage to vehicle performance and mission profile flexibility, while still providing a very reliable engine design.

40|$|New {{technologies}} {{are being developed}} to explore the distant reaches of the solar system. Beyond Mars, solar energy is inadequate to power advanced scientific instruments. One technology that can meet the energy requirements is the space nuclear reactor. The nuclear reactor {{is used as a}} heat source for which a heat-to-electricity conversion system is needed. Examples of such conversion systems are the Brayton, Rankine, and Stirling cycles. Since launch cost is proportional to the amount of mass to lift, mass is always a concern in designing spacecraft. Estimations of system masses are an important part in determining the feasibility of a design. I worked under Michael Barrett in the Thermal Energy Conversion Branch of the Power & Electric Propulsion Division. An in-house <b>Closed</b> <b>Cycle</b> <b>Engine</b> Program (CCEP) is used for the design and performance analysis of closed-Brayton-cycle energy conversion systems for space applications. This program also calculates the system mass including the heat source. CCEP uses the subroutine RSMASS, which has been updated to RSMASS-D, to estimate the mass of the reactor. RSMASS was developed in 1986 at Sandia National Laboratories to quickly estimate the mass of multi-megawatt nuclear reactors for space applications. In response to an emphasis for lower power reactors, RSMASS-D was developed in 1997 and is based off of the SP- 100 liquid metal cooled reactor. The subroutine calculates the mass of reactor components such as the safety systems, instrumentation and control, radiation shield, structure, reflector, and core. The major improvements in RSMASS-D are that it uses higher fidelity calculations, is easier to use, and automatically optimizes the systems mass. RSMASS-D is accurate within 15 % of actual data while RSMASS is only accurate within 50 %. My goal this summer was to learn FORTRAN 77 programming language and update the CCEP program with the RSMASS-D model...|$|E
