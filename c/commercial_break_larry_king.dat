40|$|The {{effects of}} number (0, 3, 6) and {{placement}} (natural, unnatural) of <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> on perception, comprehension and memory were examined. Eighty-eight college students were shown {{one of two}} films and then asked to complete six tasks: (1) estimation of film's duration, (2) rating of film's comprehensibility, (3) summarization of story plot and theme, (4) scene recognition, (5) temporal ordering of scenes, and (6) identifying the location of <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks.</b> Overall, results suggest that an unnatural placement of <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> has an adverse effect on cognitive processing and that performance increasingly deteriorates with more <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks.</b> Conversely, <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> appearing at natural breakpoints led to a higher overall performance that was less affected {{by the number of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> that occurred. An effect of film was also found, suggesting that a film with a more organized plot structure can integrate natural <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> more beneficially than a less-structured film...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the choice of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> by a television network in both monopoly and duopoly settings. Viewers dislike commercials in the model, while the networks seek to maximize the total audience for these commercials through their choice of the number, length, and timing of <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks.</b> The model’s prediction of a network’s optimal choice seems to match what we observe in reality; in particular, <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> appear more frequent {{toward the end of}} the program, and the optimal length of breaks is single-peaked. In duopoly equilibrium, <b>commercial</b> <b>breaks</b> on two networks must have the same length and appear at the same time. Compared to monopoly, the breaks in a duopoly equilibrium are longer and/or appear later...|$|R

50|$|Fox, {{who started}} {{covering}} NASCAR in 2001, resisted {{the use of}} the technology for many years. By about 2010, however, executives began exploring the concept. In 2011, they conducted one experimental <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> with a split-screen format. Through 2011, Fox has preferred to air traditional, full-screen commercials, and if any action occurs during the break, their policy is to interrupt the commercial and return to the live action (e.g. at the 2013 Auto Club 400, the broadcast was in a <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> when Clint Bowyer blew an engine and spun, so the feed immediately cut the <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> right away; at the 2013 Aaron's 499, the feed was in <b>commercial</b> <b>break</b> when a crash occurred on lap 43). FOX returned to using the side-by-side coverage during the 2012 Daytona 500.|$|R
