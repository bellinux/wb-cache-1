For example, if a reaction follows the following energy profile, all three experiments will yield a significant primary kinetic isotope effect:On the other hand, if a reaction follows the following energy profile, in which the C-H or C-D bond cleavage is irreversible but occurs after the rate-determining step (RDS), no significant kinetic isotope effect will be observed with Experiment A, since the overall rate is not affected by the isotopic substitution. Nevertheless, the irreversible C-H bond <b>cleavage</b> <b>step</b> will give a primary kinetic isotope effect with the other two experiments, since the second step would still affect the product distribution. Therefore, with Experiments B and C, it is possible to observe the kinetic isotope effect even if C-H or C-D bond cleavage occurs not in the rate-determining step, but in the product-determining step.|$|E

40|$|Cleavage factor I(m) is an {{essential}} component of the pre-messenger RNA 3 '-end processing machinery in higher eukaryotes, participating in both the polyadenylation and <b>cleavage</b> <b>steps.</b> <b>Cleavage</b> factor I(m) is an oligomer composed of a small 25 kDa subunit (CF I(m) 25) and a variable larger subunit of either 59, 68 or 72 kDa. The small subunit also interacts with RNA, poly(A) polymerase, and the nuclear poly(A) -binding protein. These protein-protein interactions are thought to be facilitated by the Nudix domain of CF I(m) 25, a hydrolase motif with a characteristic alpha/beta/alpha fold and a conserved catalytic sequence or Nudix box. We present here the crystal structures of human CF I(m) 25 in its free and diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap(4) A) bound forms at 1. 85 and 1. 80 A, respectively. CF I(m) 25 crystallizes as a dimer and presents the classical Nudix fold. Results from crystallographic and biochemical experiments suggest that CF I(m) 25 makes use of its Nudix fold to bind but not hydrolyze ATP and Ap(4) A. The complex and apo protein structures provide insight into the active oligomeric state of CF I(m) and suggest a possible role of nucleotide binding in either the polyadenylation and/or <b>cleavage</b> <b>steps</b> of pre-messenger RNA 3 '-end processing...|$|R

50|$|B-type lamins are {{characterized}} by an acidic isoelectirc point, and they are typically expressed in every cell. As with A-type lamins, there are multiple isoforms of B-type lamins, the most common being lamins B1 and B2. They are produced from two separate genes, LMNB1 and LMNB2, respectively. Similar to prelamin A, B-type lamins also contain a CaaX motif at the carboxyl-terminus. This marker triggers the same sequence of posttranslational modifications previously described for prelamin A except for the final <b>cleavage</b> <b>step</b> involving a zinc metalloprotease. Further investigations of B-type lamins across multiple species have found evidence that supports that B-type lamins existed before A-type lamins. This stems from the similarity in structure of B-type lamins between invertebrates and vertebrates. Furthermore, organisms that only contain a single lamin contain a B-type lamin. Other studies that have investigated the structural {{similarities and differences between}} A- and B-type lamins have found that the positions of introns/exons in B-type lamins have been conserved in A-type lamins, with more variations in the A-type lamins. This suggests that the common ancestor of these lamin types was a B-type lamin.|$|E

Methods for growing the epitaxial layer on monocrystalline silicon or other wafers include: various types of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) classified as Atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD) or metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), as well as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Two [...] "kerfless" [...] methods (without abrasive sawing) for separating the epitaxial layer from the substrate are called [...] "implant-cleave" [...] and [...] "stress liftoff". A method applicable when the epi-layer and substrate are the same material employs ion implantation to deposit {{a thin layer of}} crystal impurity atoms and resulting mechanical stress at the precise depth of the intended epi layer thickness. The induced localized stress provide a controlled path for crack propagation in the following <b>cleavage</b> <b>step.</b> In the dry stress lift-off process applicable when the epi-layer and substrate are suitably different materials, a controlled crack is driven by a temperature change at the epi/wafer interface purely by the thermal stresses due to the mismatch in thermal expansion between the epi layer and substrate, without the necessity for any external mechanical force or tool to aid crack propagation. It was reported that this process yields single atomic plane cleavage, reducing the need for post lift-off polishing, and allowing multiple reuses of the substrate up to 10 times.|$|E

40|$|The {{superfamily}} 1 bacterial helicase PcrA {{has a role}} in the {{replication of}} certain plasmids, acting with the initiator protein (RepD) that binds to and nicks the double-stranded origin of replication. PcrA also translocates single-stranded DNA with discrete steps of one base per ATP hydrolyzed. Individual rate constants have been determined for the DNA helicase PcrA ATPase cycle when bound to either single-stranded DNA or a double-stranded DNA junction that also has RepD bound. The fluorescent ATP analogue 2 '(3 ') -O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) ATP was used throughout all experiments to provide a complete ATPase cycle for a single nucleotide species. Fluorescence intensity and anisotropy stopped-flow measurements were used to determine rate constants for binding and release. Quenched-flow measurements provided the kinetics of the hydrolytic <b>cleavage</b> <b>step.</b> The fluorescent phosphate sensor MDCC-PBP was used to measure phosphate release kinetics. The chemical <b>cleavage</b> <b>step</b> is the rate-limiting step in the cycle and is essentially irreversible and would result in the bound ATP complex being a major component at steady state. This <b>cleavage</b> <b>step</b> is greatly accelerated by bound DNA, producing the high activation of this protein compared to the protein alone. The data suggest the possibility that ADP is released in two steps, which would result in bound ADP also being a major intermediate, with bound ADP. P(i) being a very small component. It therefore seems likely that the major transition in structure occurs during the <b>cleavage</b> <b>step,</b> rather than P(i) release. ATP rebinding could then cause reversal of this structural transition.

However, the mechanism of plant miRNA biogenesis still remains poorly understood. In this article, the process of Arabidopsis miR 163 biogenesis was examined. The results revealed that two types of miR 163 primary transcripts (pri-miR 163 s) are transcribed from a single gene by RNA polymerase II and that miR 163 biogenesis requires at least three <b>cleavage</b> <b>steps</b> by RNase III-like enzymes at 21 -nt-long intervals.

The RNA editing hypothesis postulates that AID deaminates cytosine in an unknown mRNA to generate a new mRNA encoding SHM endonuclease. On the other hand, the DNA deamination hypothesis explains DNA cleavage by cytosine deamination in DNA, followed by uracil removal by uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG). By using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, we showed that SHM requires de novo protein synthesis in accord with predictions by the RNA editing hypothesis. In addition, we found that cycloheximide but not Ugi (the specific inhibitor of UNG) inhibited AID-dependent DNA cleavage in the Ig gene during SHM, by using histone H 2 AX focus formation as a marker of DNA cleavage. The results indicate the following order of events: AID expression, protein synthesis, DNA cleavage, and SHM.

While the overall reaction to form the C-MoL 3 and O-MoL 3 products was calculated to be energetically favorable, both the encounter complex and intermediate dimer, L 3 Mo-CO-MoL 3, were found to be lower in energy than the products, with the final C-O <b>cleavage</b> <b>step</b> calculated to be endothermic by 169 kJ mol- 1 and 163 kJ mol- 1 for L = NH 2 and N(tBu) Ar, respectively. The unfavorable CO <b>cleavage</b> <b>step</b> {{can be attributed to the}} fact that Mo does not possess the optimum d-electron configuration to sufficiently stabilise the carbide and oxide products relative to the CO-bridged intermediate dimer...|$|E
40|$|The {{route of}} toluene {{degradation}} by Pseudomonas mendocina KR 1 was studied by separating or purifying from toluene-grown cells the catabolic enzymes responsible for oxidation of p-cresol through the ring <b>cleavage</b> <b>step.</b> Enzymatic transformations corresponding {{to each of}} the metabolic steps in the proposed degradative pathway were conducted with cell-free preparations. p-Cresol was metabolized by the enzyme p-cresol methylhydroxylase to p-hydroxybenzaldehyde. p-Hydroxybenzaldehyde was further oxidized by partially purified enzyme preparations to p-hydroxybenzoate and subsequently hydroxylated to form protocatechuate. Protocatechuate was then oxidized by ortho ring cleavage...|$|E
40|$|A new {{miniaturized}} {{protein and}} peptide sequenator has been constructed which uses gas phase reagents at the coupling and <b>cleavage</b> <b>steps</b> of the Edman degradation. The sample {{is embedded in}} a matrix of Polybrene dried onto a porous glass fiber disc located in a small cartridge-style reaction cell. The protein or peptide, though not covalently attached to the support, is essentially immobile throughout the degradative cycle, since only relatively apolar, liquid phase solvents pass through the cell. This instrument can give useful sequence data on as little as 5 pmol or protein, can perform extended sequence runs (greater than 30 residues) on subnanomole quantities of proteins purified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and can sequence hydrophobic peptides to completion. The sequenator {{is characterized by a}} high repetitive yield during the degradation, low reagent consumption, low maintenance requirements, and a degradative cycle time of only 50 min using a complete double cleavage program...|$|R
40|$|RAG 1 and RAG 2 {{catalyze}} {{the first}} DNA <b>cleavage</b> <b>steps</b> in V(D) J recombination. We {{demonstrate that the}} isolated central domain of RAG 1 has inherent single-stranded (ss) DNA cleavage activity, which does not require, but is enhanced by, RAG 2. The central domain, therefore, contains the active-site residues necessary to perform hydrolysis of the DNA phosphodiester backbone. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of this domain on ss DNA is abolished by addition of the C-terminal domain of RAG 1. The inhibitory effects of this latter domain are suppressed on substrates containing double-stranded (ds) DNA. Together, {{the activities of the}} reconstituted domains on ss versus mixed ds-ss DNA approximate the activity of intact RAG 1 in the presence of RAG 2. We propose how the combined actions of the RAG 1 domains may function in V(D) J recombination and also in aberrant cleavage reactions that may lead to genomic instability in B and T lymphocytes...|$|R
40|$|RAG- 1 and RAG- 2 {{initiate}} V(D) J recombination by binding {{to specific}} recognition sequences (RSS) and then cleave the DNA in two steps: nicking and hairpin formation. Recent work has established that a dimer of RAG- 1 and either {{one or two}} monomers of RAG- 2 bind to a single RSS, but the enzymatic contributions of the RAG molecules within this nucleoprotein complex and its functional organization have not been elucidated. Using heterodimeric protein preparations containing both wild-type and catalytically deficient RAG- 1 molecules, we found that one active monomer is sufficient for both nicking and hairpin formation at a single RSS, demonstrating that a single active site can carry out both <b>cleavage</b> <b>steps.</b> Furthermore, the mutant heterodimers efficiently cleaved both RSS in a synaptic complex. These results strongly suggest that two RAG- 1 dimers are responsible for RSS cleavage in a synaptic complex, with one monomer of each dimer catalyzing both nicking and hairpin formation at each RSS...|$|R
