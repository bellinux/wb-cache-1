5|$|The club first {{introduced}} shirt sponsorship in the 1985–86 season when future chairman Eddie Thompson's VG chain sponsored {{the club in}} the first of a two-year deal. A six-year association with Belhaven then ensued with a sponsorless 1993–94 season. Rover began a two-year deal early in time for the 1994 Scottish Cup final, sponsoring the club {{until the end of the}} 1995–96 season. Telewest took over sponsorship from 1996 for six years until Eddie Thompson's Morning, Noon and Night started sponsoring the club in 2002. This association continued until 2006 when Anglian Home Improvements began a two-year deal with an optional third year. At the same time, Ole International became the first shorts sponsors. JD Sports' Carbrini Sportswear brand sponsored the club in the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons. United's shirt sponsor since the 2010–11 season has been <b>Calor</b> Gas.|$|E

Canvey Island was home to Prout's Catermarans from 1949 to 2002. Canvey {{is also home to}} a <b>Calor</b> Gas Storage Terminal, and an Oikos Oil depot located off Thames Road and Holehaven Road.|$|E
25|$|In its medical {{sense it}} has {{traditionally}} meant an abnormal {{swelling of the}} flesh. The Roman medical encyclopedist Celsus (ca 30 BC–38 AD) described the four cardinal signs of acute inflammation as tumor, dolor, <b>calor,</b> and rubor (swelling, pain, increased heat, and redness). His treatise, De Medicina, was the first medical book printed in 1478 following {{the invention of the}} movable-type printing press.|$|E
25|$|The {{camp was}} {{situated}} between a main road and a railway line. The site {{consisted of a}} large communal area, a visitors centre and several personal dwellings. All buildings were made from re-cycled materials. The communal area featured seating, heating and a bookcase. The buildings were heated by wood burning fires and run off donated wood. Water was collected on a daily basis. Food was cooked on a <b>calor</b> gas oven {{and there was a}} composting toilet. A wind generator provided some of the evening lighting.|$|E
25|$|Mastitis is an {{inflammation}} of the breast. It causes local pain (dolor), redness (rubor), swelling (tumor), and warmth (<b>calor).</b> Later stages of mastitis cause symptoms of systemic infection like fever and nausea. It mostly occurs 2–3 weeks after delivery but can happen at any time. Typically results from milk stasis with primary or secondary local, later systemic infection. Infectious organisms include Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp. and E. coli. Continued breastfeeding, plenty of rest and adequate fluid supply is the best treatment for light cases.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 and {{for some}} years {{afterwards}} in Britain, factory-made aqualungs were very expensive, and many aqualungs of this type were made by sport divers in diving clubs' workshops, using miscellaneous industrial and war-surplus parts. One necessary raw material was a <b>Calor</b> Gas bottled butane gas regulator, whose 1950s version was like an aqualung regulator's second stage but passed gas {{all the time because}} its diaphragm was spring-loaded; conversion included changing the spring and making several big holes in the wet-side casing. The cylinder was often an ex-RAF pilot's oxygen cylinder; some of these cylinders were called tadpoles from their shape.|$|E
25|$|Shipham parish council, {{which was}} {{established}} in 1894, has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also {{the responsibility of the}} council. In 2008, Shipham Parish Council won the communications category of the <b>Calor</b> Somerset Village of the Year competition.|$|E

500|$|RAF Abingdon's chaplain, Rev. Stanley Harrison, {{and medical}} officer, Flying Officer Charles Evans, joined the rescue. An {{hour and a}} half after the crash they rescued the {{surviving}} RAF Police dog. They continued rescue work for three hours and removed 14 bodies from the wreckage. An RAF document states: [...] "At one stage a <b>Calor</b> gas cylinder bottle exploded near these officers and the fire thereupon began to gain ground. Undeterred by this, they continued their search of the wreckage until it was clear that there could be no survivors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Pendoylan {{having won}} the Environment Category in the 2004 <b>Calor</b> Village of the Year for Wales competition, Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, visited {{the village and}} met {{residents}} on 14 July 2005 [...] He presented a plaque and said in his speech [...] "It is a real joy to see such a wonderful functioning village with such a sense of community".|$|E
2500|$|In C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia {{series of}} novels, Calormen [...] {{is a large}} country to the {{southeast}} of Narnia. Lewis derived {{its name from the}} Latin <b>calor,</b> meaning [...] "heat". When using the name as an adjective or an ethnonym, Lewis spelled the name with an 'e' at the end: a Calormene [...] soldier; [...] "The Calormenes have dark faces and long beards." [...] Narnia and Calormen are separated by the country of Archenland and a large desert. In The Horse and His Boy Calormen is described as being many times the size of its northern neighbours, and it is implied that its army is always either conquering more land or keeping down rebellions, in wars with which neither Narnia or Archenland are involved. The border of the Calormene Empire extends from the Western Mountains to the Great Eastern Ocean. The Calormene capital city is Tashbaan, a vast, walled metropolis near the northern desert separating Calormen from its northern neighbors, located near the mouth of the Calormen River.|$|E
2500|$|Benevento, as Maleventum, [...] {{was one of}} {{the chief}} cities of Samnium, {{situated}} on the Via Appia at a distance of [...] east from Capua {{on the banks of the}} river <b>Calor</b> (modern Calore). There is some discrepancy as to the people to which it belonged at contact: Pliny expressly assigns it to the Hirpini; but Livy certainly seems to consider it as belonging to the Samnites proper, as distinguished from the Hirpini; and Ptolemy adopts the same view. All ancient writers concur in representing it as a very ancient city; Solinus and Stephanus of Byzantium ascribe its foundation to Diomedes; a legend which appears to have been adopted by the inhabitants, who, in the time of Procopius, pretended to exhibit the tusks of the Calydonian Boar in proof of their descent. Festus, on the contrary (s. v. Ausoniam), related that it was founded by Auson, a son of Ulysses and Circe; a tradition which indicates that it was an ancient Ausonian city, previous to its conquest by the Samnites. But it first appears in history as a Samnite city; and must have already been a place of strength, so that the Romans did not venture to attack it during their first two wars with the Samnites. It appears, however, to have fallen into their hands during the Third Samnite War, though the exact occasion is unknown.|$|E

It's too bad your hat got sidetracked. Maybe they'll get that trestle mended yet in time for Easter." ...|$|E

In the latter he is 'vita vivificans, principium spiritualis, id est, veræ reproductionis in vitam veram'. Now this principle, or 'vis vitæ vitam vivificans', considered in 'forma passiva, assimilationem patiens', {{at the same}} time that it excites the soul to the vital act of assimilating--this is the Blood of Christ, really present through faith to, and actually partaken by, the faithful. Of this the body is the continual product, that is, a good life-the merits of Christ acting on the soul, redemptive.|$|E
60|$|Two men listened uneasily to this {{disparagement}} {{of their}} kind. One was Wells Pearson, foreman of the Mucho <b>Calor</b> cattle ranch. The other was Thompson Burrows, the prosperous sheepman from the Quintana Valley. Both thought Tonia Weaver adorable, {{especially when she}} railed at railroads and menaced men. Either would have given up his epidermis to make for her an Easter hat more cheerfully than the ostrich gives up his tip or the aigrette lays down its life. Neither possessed the ingenuity to conceive a means of supplying the sad deficiency against the coming Sabbath. Pearson's deep brown face and sunburned light hair gave him {{the appearance of a}} schoolboy seized by one of youth's profound and insolvable melancholies. Tonia's plight grieved him through and through. Thompson Burrows was the more skilled and pliable. He hailed from somewhere in the East originally; and he wore neckties and shoes, and was made dumb by woman's presence.|$|E
