25|$|For {{the past}} years, {{researchers}} {{have been trying to}} reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. Thin-film solar cell is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants. Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques. Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the OPTOS formalism. In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si. In combination with anti-reflective <b>coating,</b> <b>surface</b> texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell. Consequently, required thickness for solar cells decreases with the increased absorption of light rays.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the saturated pool boiling of water on a 12 mm diameter horizontal heating <b>surface</b> <b>coated</b> with titanium oxide (TiO 2) nanoparticles under atmospheric pressure. The TiO 2 <b>coated</b> <b>surface</b> was formed during nucleate boiling of TiO 2 (25 nm diameter) -water-surfactant nanofluid on the plain heating surface at high heat flux conditions. It {{was found that the}} CHF of water boiling on the TiO 2 <b>coated</b> <b>surface</b> increased up to about 1. 8 times the CHF for the uncoated (plain) surface. To examine the mechanism of the CHF enhancement by TiO 2 nanoparticle coating, liquid-vapor behaviors close to the heating surface were measured using a conductance probe with a tip diameter smaller than 5 μm. The probe signals and the void fraction distributions showed that there is little difference in the liquid-vapor structure in the boiling on the uncoated surface and on the TiO 2 <b>coated</b> <b>surface,</b> that a liquid rich layer (a so called macrolayer) remains on the heating surface, and that in boiling on the TiO 2 <b>coated</b> <b>surface</b> it does not dry out even at heat fluxes far higher than the CHF of the uncoated surface. The thickness of the macrolayer formed beneath large vapor masses was determined from the location where the probe signals corresponding to the large vapor masses disappear.

50|$|In general, {{the lower}} the surface tension of a liquid coating, the easier {{it will be to}} form a {{satisfactory}} wet film from it. The difference between the surface tension of a coating and the surface energy of a solid substrate to which a coating is applied affects how the liquid coating flows out over the substrate. It also affects the strength of the adhesive bond between the substrate and the dry film. If for instance, the surface tension of the coating is higher than the surface tension of the substrate, then the coating will not spread out and form a film. As the surface tension of the substrate is increased, it will reach a point to where the coating will successfully wet the substrate but have poor adhesion. Continuous increase in the <b>coating</b> <b>surface</b> tension will result in better wetting in film formation and better dry film adhesion.|$|E

Finally, several powder colors can be applied before curing them all together, allowing color blending and bleed special effects in a single layer.|$|R

50|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} (TBC) are highly advanced materials systems usually applied to metallic surfaces, such as on gas turbine or aero-engine parts, operating at elevated temperatures, {{as a form}} of exhaust heat management. These 100 μm to 2 mm coatings serve to insulate components from large and prolonged heat loads by utilizing thermally insulating materials which can sustain an appreciable temperature difference between the load-bearing alloys and the <b>coating</b> <b>surface.</b> In doing so, these coatings can allow for higher operating temperatures while limiting the thermal exposure of structural components, extending part life by reducing oxidation and thermal fatigue. In conjunction with active film cooling, TBCs permit working fluid temperatures higher than the melting point of the metal airfoil in some turbine applications. Due to increasing demand for higher engine operation (efficiency increases at higher temperatures), better durability/lifetime, and thinner coatings to reduce parasitic weight for rotating/moving components, there is great motivation to develop new and advanced TBCs.|$|E

40|$|How the {{diffusive}} {{dynamics of}} colloidal spheres {{changes in the}} vicinity of a particle-coated surface is of importance for industrial challenges such as fouling and sedimentation as well as for fundamental studies into confinement effects.

Comparison of MSDs at the bare and <b>coated</b> <b>surfaces</b> for EVF of 0. 2 – 0. 4 revealed that at the latter surface the motion amplitudes are strongly reduced, accompanied by a sharp transition from diffusive to nearly caged motion. This clearly indicates that the surface-attached particles cannot be taken into account via volume fraction and that their immobility has a distinct effect.

40|$|Reliable life {{prediction}} {{models for}} the durability of thermal barrier coatings require {{the identification of the}} relative importance of various mechanisms responsible for the failure of the coatings at high temperatures. Studies of these mechanisms in sub-systems of thermal barrier coatings can provide valuable information. In the present work, we undertake an experimental study of "rumpling", or progressive roughening of the bond <b>coat</b> <b>surface</b> in the bond coat-superalloy systems upon high temperature exposure. Thermal cycling and isothermal experiments are carried out on a platinum-aluminide bond coat and on a NiCoCrAlY bond coat deposited on a Ni-based superalloy in air and in vacuum. The cyclic experiments are conducted in air from 200 ??C to 1200 ??C for different levels of initial roughness of the bond <b>coat</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Isothermal experiments are carried out at various temperatures, ranging from 960 ??C to 1200 ??C. The bond <b>coat</b> <b>surfaces</b> in cyclic experiments rumple to a similar characteristic wavelength of about 60 - 100 ??m and an amplitude varying from 2 ??m to 5 ??m. Additional small scale fluctuations are seen to develop between the thermally grown oxide (TGO) and the bond <b>coat</b> <b>surface</b> with a wavelength of about 3 - 5 ??m. Smooth initial bond <b>coat</b> <b>surfaces</b> (fluctuations in tens of nanometers) are seen to have rumpled, indicating that significant initial flaws are not required for rumpling to occur. Observations of the rumpled bond coat edges are shown to indicate that bond coat stresses play a dominant role during the rumpling process. On comparing the experimental observations with existing rumpling models in literature, it is concluded that the TGO and the microstructural changes in the bond coat have a rather limited role in inducing rumpling.
