5|$|During the Mesozoic (245 to 66 {{million years}} ago) the <b>conifers</b> flourished and became adapted {{to live in}} all the major {{terrestrial}} habitats. Subsequently, the tree forms of flowering plants evolved during the Cretaceous period. These began to dominate the <b>conifers</b> during the Tertiary era (66 to 2 million years ago) when forests covered the globe. When the climate cooled 1.5 million years ago and {{the first of four}} ice ages occurred, the forests retreated as the ice advanced. In the interglacials, trees recolonised the land that had been covered by ice, only to be driven back again in the next ice age.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Management {{of habitat}} for bats {{requires}} sound {{information on their}} habitat requirements. I used radio telemetry to identify 80 roosts for 24 long-eared myotis (Myotis evotis); 74 roosts were identified for 21 females and 6 roosts for 3 males. Females primarily used dead and defective <b>conifer</b> trees (n= 22) and <b>conifer</b> stumps (n= 41) though they also used 3 live <b>conifer</b> trees, 1 live and 5 dead hardwood trees, and 2 <b>conifer</b> logs. Males used one {{each of the following}} structures: dead <b>conifer,</b> dead hardwood, <b>conifer</b> log, <b>conifer</b> stump, slash pile, and rock crevice. Female long-eared myotis primarily roosted in <b>conifer</b> stumps in landscapes dominated by younger forests and used dead or defective <b>conifer</b> trees and stumps in landscapes characterized by older forests. Roosts generally were located in upland habitats. Odds of a dead or defective <b>conifer</b> being used as a roosts was associated with decay class, presence of snags, and distance {{to the edge of the}} stand. Odds of a <b>conifer</b> stump being used was associated with amount of species of stump, height of the stump on the downhill side, access, woody debris within 1 m, and slope (...|$|R

5|$|The Morrison Formation is {{interpreted}} as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of <b>conifers,</b> tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycads, ginkoes, and several families of <b>conifers.</b> Animal fossils discovered include bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles like Dorsetochelys, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans like Hoplosuchus, several species of pterosaurs such as Harpactognathus and Mesadactylus, numerous dinosaur species, and early mammals such as docodonts (like Docodon), multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts.|$|E

40|$|NOAA- 9 {{satellite}} {{data from the}} Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) were {{used in conjunction with}} Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) data to determine the proportion of closed canopy <b>conifer</b> forest cover in the Cascade Range of Oregon. A closed canopy <b>conifer</b> map, as determined from the MSS, was registered with AVHRR pixels. Regression was used to relate closed canopy <b>conifer</b> forest cover to AVHRR spectral data. A two-variable (band) regression model accounted for more variance in <b>conifer</b> cover than the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The spectral signatures of various <b>conifer</b> successional stages were also examined.

5|$|Agaricus hondensis, {{commonly}} known as the felt-ringed agaricus, is a species of fungus in the family Agaricaceae. The species was officially described in 1912 by mycologist William Alphonso Murrill, along with three other Agaricus species that have since been placed in synonymy with A.hondensis.

5|$|Othnielosaurus {{was one of}} {{the smaller}} members of the diverse Morrison Formation dinosaur fauna, {{diminutive}} in comparison to the giant sauropods. The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons, and flat floodplains. Vegetation varied from river-lining gallery forests of <b>conifers,</b> tree ferns, and ferns, to fern savannas with rare trees. It has been a rich fossil hunting ground, holding fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of <b>conifers.</b> Other fossils discovered include bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans, several species of pterosaur, numerous dinosaur species, and early mammals such as docodonts, multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts. Such dinosaurs as the theropods Ceratosaurus, Allosaurus, Ornitholestes, and Torvosaurus, the sauropods Apatosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus, and the ornithischians Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, and Stegosaurus are known from the Morrison.

30|$|Our general {{sampling}} methods follow Margolis et al. (2007), in which large quaking aspen patches embedded in mesic mixed <b>conifer</b> and spruce-fir {{forests of the}} upper Rio Grande Basin were mapped and tree-ring dated with multiple lines of evidence to reconstruct stand-replacing fire patch sizes and dates. The four lines of evidence included 1) quaking aspen age structure, 2) <b>conifer</b> death dates, 3) <b>conifer</b> traumatic resin ducts or ring-width changes, and 4) <b>conifer</b> fire scars. All <b>conifer</b> death dates were bark-ring dates. Bark-ring dates indicate that either bark or other evidence of an intact outer ring (e.g., insect galleries) was present on the samples—this ensures that the outer ring dates are actual tree death dates.|$|R
