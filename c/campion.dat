5|$|The {{headland}} {{is primarily}} covered with grass, {{as well as}} heather (Calluna vulgaris), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), thyme (Thymus polytrichus) and western gorse (Ulex gallii). In 1962, specimens of the comparatively rare western clover (Trifolium occidentale) were found on Zennor Head. The lichen Dirina massiliensis has also been found high on the acid schist cliffs on the north-, seaward-side of the headland. The parasitic plant dodder (Cuscuta epithymum) is found growing on gorse. There are also typical coastal flowering plants such as kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), sea <b>campion</b> (Silene uniflora), and thrift (Armeria maritima).|$|E

50|$|This {{cosmopolitan}} {{family of}} mostly herbaceous plants is best represented in temperate climates, {{with a few}} species growing on tropical mountains. Some of the more commonly known members include pinks and carnations (Dianthus), and firepink and <b>campions</b> (Lychnis and Silene). Many species are grown as ornamental plants, and some species are widespread weeds. Most species grow in the Mediterranean and bordering regions of Europe and Asia. The number of genera and species in the Southern Hemisphere is rather small, although the family does contain Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis), the world's southernmost dicot, {{which is one of}} only two flowering plants found in Antarctica.|$|R
5|$|The site is {{characterized}} by a mosaic of 17 plant communities regrouped into three main types of ecological units: grassy open areas, shrubby areas and wooded areas. Of these, three are listed in the Habitats Directive. The calcareous rocky slopes with chasmophytic vegetation Cystopterido fragilis-Asplenietum scolopendrii are considered as exceptional, with a degree of uncertainty in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. Hydrophilous tall herb fringe community with Petasites hybridus, at the limit of its range, is also exceptional. The herbaceous fringe with red <b>campion</b> (Silene dioica) et wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) (Sileno dioicae - Myosotidetum sylvaticae) is very rare in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The wood-fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli is also regionally interesting.|$|E

This M was later revealed to be none other than James Moriarty in disguise, using the League to win a gang war against Fu Manchu. After the death of Moriarty, Sherlock Holmes's older brother Mycroft Holmes {{assumed the role of}} M. In the sequel volume , set during a moribund and dystopian 1950s post-war Britain, the head of the British secret service, M, is Harry Lime, from Graham Greene's The Third Man. In the final volume of , spanning from 1910 to 2009, the M of 2009 is an elderly Emma Peel from The Avengers.

5|$|Ferrier's discography {{consists}} of studio recordings originally {{made on the}} Columbia and Decca labels, and recordings taken from live performances which were later issued as discs. In the years since her death, many of her recordings have received multiple reissues on modern media; between 1992 and 1996 Decca issued the Kathleen Ferrier Edition, incorporating much of Ferrier's recorded repertoire, on 10 compact discs. The discographer Paul <b>Campion</b> has drawn attention to numerous works which she performed but did not record, or for which no complete recording has yet surfaced. For example, only one aria from Elgar's Dream of Gerontius, and none of her renderings of 20th century songs by Holst, Bax, Delius and others were recorded. Only {{a small part of}} her St John Passion was captured on disc.|$|E
60|$|I came slowly, {{stepping}} {{very carefully}} {{because of these}} drugged, feebly awakening things, through the barley to the hedge. It was a very glorious hedge, so that it held my eyes. It flowed along and interlaced like splendid music. It was rich with lupin, honeysuckle, <b>campions,</b> and ragged robin; bed straw, hops, and wild clematis twined and hung among its branches, and all along its ditch border the starry stitchwort lifted its childish faces, and chorused in lines and masses. Never had I seen such a symphony of note-like flowers and tendrils and leaves. And suddenly in its depths, I heard a chirrup and the whirr of startled wings.|$|R

Flora Day is {{administered}} by Stewards who elect stewards therefore continuing this wonderful occasion without outside interference. Helston Town Band play the famous tune and accompany all four dances on a long route around the town. The dwellings and shops of the town are festooned with bluebells, <b>campions</b> and whatever green foliage is available. Specific dances (not including the children's dance) go {{into and out of}} various private buildings, shops and grounds. The origins of the dance are not known but appear to represent a pre-Christian celebration of the passing of winter.|$|R
60|$|Miriam {{came for}} him a little later {{to know if he}} would go with Clara and her for a walk. They set off down to Strelley Mill Farm. As they were going beside the brook, on the Willey Water side, looking through the brake {{at the edge of the}} wood, where pink <b>campions</b> glowed under a few sunbeams, they saw, beyond the tree-trunks and the thin hazel bushes, a man leading a great bay horse through the gullies. The big red beast seemed to dance romantically through that dimness of green hazel drift, away there where the air was shadowy, as if it were in the past, among the fading bluebells that might have bloomed for Deidre or Iseult.|$|R
5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid and carline thistle flower on the dunes, and Holkham's Corsican pines shelter creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest orchids. The shingle ridges on Scolt Head Island and from Blakeney Point east to Salthouse attract biting stonecrop, sea <b>campion,</b> yellow horned poppy, sea thrift and sea beet. Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat.|$|E
5|$|Robert Catesby was {{the third}} and only {{surviving}} son of Sir William and Anne (née Throckmorton) Catesby, and was probably born in or after 1572 at his father's main residence in Lapworth. Robert was a lineal descendant of Sir William Catesby (1450–1485), the influential councillor of Richard III captured at the Battle of Bosworth and executed. On his mother's side he was descended from Sir Robert Throckmorton of Coughton, and his second wife, Elizabeth Hussey. His parents were prominent recusant Catholics; his father had suffered years of imprisonment for his faith, and in 1581 had been tried in Star Chamber alongside William Vaux, 3rd Baron Vaux of Harrowden, and his brother-in-law Sir Thomas Tresham, for harbouring the Jesuit Edmund <b>Campion.</b> The head of the Throckmortons, Sir Thomas Throckmorton, was also fined for his recusancy, and spent years in prison. Another relation, Sir Francis Throckmorton, had been executed in 1584 for his involvement in a plot to free Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|E
5|$|The shingle ridge {{that protects}} the reserve from the sea and extends to Blakeney Point attracts biting stonecrop, sea <b>campion,</b> yellow horned poppy, sea thrift, bird's foot trefoil and sea beet. Sea barley is a scarcer species of this habitat. In the damper areas, sea wormwood, sea {{lavender}} and scrubby sea-blite also thrive. The saltmarsh contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The uncommon spiral tasselweed and long-bracted sedge are other saltmarsh specialists. The upper saltmarsh {{has a number of}} scarce species including lesser centaury, curved hard-grass and sea pearlwort, with soft hornwort in the dykes.|$|E

I doubt not but that he will lay the matter before the queen, and then that Beaufort will hear of it; but, passionate and revengeful as he is, I think that he will not be turned from his purpose, even if he knows that he may be forced to retire to his estates, or even leave the country till the matter blows over." ...|$|R
500|$|Musically, [...] "Dangerous Woman" [...] is a midtempo slow-jam pop and R song, {{with strong}} {{influences}} of rock music. It {{was described by}} Brennan Carley from Spin as a [...] "woozy, big-band piece of moody R, one that [...] "falls neatly {{at the intersection of}} bubblegum and rock and roll", The song is written in the key of E minor, while its tempo swings at a rate of 67 beats per minute in a compound duple [...] time. Grande's vocal range spans from D3 to B5. Various publications compared the track's vibe to The Weeknd's [...] "Earned It". The song has a typical verse-pre-chorus-chorus structure; it begins with a chord progression of Em–G–C. The opening verses are accompanied by guitar chords and slow beats, which is followed by her belting in the pre-chorus. A guitar solo is present during the song's bridge. Although not officially credited as a composer for the music, American singer [...] Charlie Puth can be heard beatboxing during the beginning of the song and throughout the whole track. Interviewed by TORYmax Youtube Channel, Puth declared his voice was <b>campioned</b> as he was initially working on the sound of the song.|$|R
40|$|The disproportionately large {{involvement}} of the X-chromosome in the isolation of closely related species (the large-X effect) has been reported for many animals, where X-linked genes are mostly hemizygous in the heterogametic sex. The expression of deleterious recessive mutations is thought to drive the frequent {{involvement of}} the X-chromosome in hybrid sterility, {{as well as to}} reduce interspecific gene flow for X-linked genes. Here, we evaluate the role of the X-chromosome in the speciation of two closely related plant species - the white and red <b>campions</b> (Silene latifolia and S. dioica) - that hybridize widely across Europe. The two species evolved separate sexes and sex chromosomes relatively recently (~ 10 (7) years), and unlike most animal species, most X-linked genes have intact Y-linked homologs. We demonstrate that the X-linked genes show a very small and insignificant amount of interspecific gene flow, while gene flow involving autosomal loci is significant and sufficient to homogenise the gene pools of the two species. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of the large-X effect in Silene and comprise the first report of this effect in plants. Non-hemizygosity of many X-linked genes in Silene males indicates that exposure of recessive mutations to selection may not be essential for the occurrence of the large-X effect. Several possible causes of the large-X effect in Silene are discussed. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved...|$|R
