40|$|Cutaneous loxoscelism {{envenomation}} by Loxosceles spiders {{is characterized}} by the development of a dermonecrotic lesion, strong inflammatory response, the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, and leukocyte migration to the bite site. The role of phospholipase D (PLD) from Loxosceles in the recruitment and migration of monocytes to the envenomation site has not yet been described. This study reports on the expression and production profiles of cytokines and chemokines in human skin fibroblasts treated with catalytically active and inactive recombinant PLDs from Loxosceles laeta (rLlPLD) and lipid inflammatory mediators ceramide 1 -phosphate (C 1 P) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and the evaluation of their roles in monocyte migration. Recombinant rLlPLD 1 (active) and rLlPLD 2 (inactive) isoforms induce interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 8, CXCL 1 /GRO-Î±, and CCL 2 /monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) expression and secretion in fibroblasts. Meanwhile, C 1 P and LPA only exhibited a minor effect on the expression and secretion of these cytokines and chemokines. Moreover, neutralization of both enzymes with anti-rLlPLD 1 antibodies completely inhibited the secretion of these cytokines and chemokines. Importantly, conditioned media from fibroblasts, treated with rLlPLDs, stimulated the transmigration of THP- 1 monocytes. Our data demonstrate the direct role of PLDs in <b>chemotactic</b> <b>mediator</b> synthesis for monocytes in human skin fibroblasts and indicate that inflammatory processes play an important role during loxoscelism...|$|E
40|$|The {{emphysema}} of al-antitrypsin (alAT) deficiency is concep-tualized {{to result}} from insufficient alAT allowing neutrophil elastase to destroy lung parenchyma. In addition to the defi-ciency ofalAT in these individuals resulting from mutations in the alAT gene, it is recognized that, for unknown reasons, there are also increased numbers of neutrophils in their lungs compared with normal individuals. With the knowledge that alveolar macrophages have surface receptors for neutrophil elastase, we hypothesized that the neutrophil accumulation in the lower respiratory tract in alAT deficiency may result, in part, from release ofneutrophil chemotactic activity by alveolar macrophages as they bind uninhibited neutrophil elastase. Consistent with this hypothesis, alAT-deficient alveolar mac-rophages spontaneously released nearly threefold more neutro-phil chemotactic activity than normal alveolar macrophages. Analysis ofalAT-deficient macrophage supernates by reverse-phase HPLC, molecular sieve chromatography, radioimmuno-assay, and absorption with anti-LTB 4 antibody revealed {{that the majority of}} the chemotactic activity was leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4), a mediator absent from normal macrophage super-nates. Consistent with this hypothesis, incubation of normal macrophages with human neutrophil elastase resulted in the release of the same neutrophil <b>chemotactic</b> <b>mediator.</b> Further-more, purified human alAT was able to prevent the neutrophil elastase from stimulating the macrophages to release the che-motactic factor. Together, these findings suggest that the ab-sence of a normal antineutrophil elastase screen in the lower respiratory tract permits free neutrophil elastase to bind to al-veolar macrophages, resulting in the release ofLTB 4, a process which attracts neutrophils to the alveoli ofalAT deficient indi-viduals, thus accelerating the lung destruction that character...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 40 - 47). Infectious diseases have re-emerged {{as one of}} {{the greatest}} global health challenges of the 21 st century. However, the treatments available to control infections have demonstrated a remarkable deficiency in their ability to fight numerous bacterial pathogens that cause disease. Therefore, novel strategies and treatments must be examined to tackle this growing challenge. One approach currently under investigation is the employment of host immune defenses, more specifically those involved in innate immunity. The innate immune system serves as the body's first line of defense during a pathogenic microbial assault. A variety of cell populations including neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells are involved in innate immune function, releasing diverse mediators such as alarmins, cytokines and chemokines. Among the compounds capable of activating the cells involved in innate immunity is the complement fragment, C 5 a. The principal role of native C 5 a is to recruit inflammatory cells and lymphocytes to sites of tissue injury and infection, and to then activate various effector responses including neutrophil degranulation, and inflammatory and <b>chemotactic</b> <b>mediator</b> release. Toward this end our collaborators have developed a unique innate immune activator known as EP 67, derived from the biologically active region of human C 5 a. EP 67 induces the activation of macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in the synthesis and release of multiple cytokines important for the activation of innate immunity. We have also observed that EP 67 exhibits antimicrobial properties. Currently, we are investigating the use of EP 67 as a novel immunobiotic to fight infectious diseases caused by two significant Gram-positive human pathogens, antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus, GBS) ...|$|E

By the use of 111 Indium and 125 Iodine labeling of homologous neutrophils (PMNs) and homologous albumin, respectively, it has been possible to obtain highly reproducible and quantitative parameters of the acute inflammatory response. The lung responds in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner to the instillation of preformed <b>chemotactic</b> <b>mediators.</b> The quantitative parameters indicative of PMN influx were more prominent than changes in vascular permeability.

Nonchemotactic substances such as human IgG, serum albumin, and C 4 failed to induce inflammatory responses in lung.

40|$|The mast cell, {{located at}} mucosal {{surfaces}} and surrounding venules, is uniquely positioned to respond rapidly to insults {{to the host}} by mediating {{the development of a}} wide-ranging inflammatory response. Activation of the mast cell releases preformed granule-associated chemical mediators and generates de novo biologically active materials. The properties of the mast cell mediators permit development of both acute and prolonged inflammatory responses. The immediate response is characterized by edema and the delayed response by leukocyte infiltration and vascular damage. The mast cell mediators responsible for these inflammatory events are characterized functionally. The vasoactive/smooth muscle reactive mediators include preformed histamine and serotonin and newlygenerated platelet activating factor, slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis and prostaglandins. <b>Chemotactic</b> <b>mediators</b> include eosinophil-selective ECF-A and ECF-oligopeptides, neutrophil-selective NCF, and lipid <b>chemotactic</b> <b>mediators</b> with broad specifcity.

Monoclonal antibodies to LTB 4 receptors (LTB 4 -R) were generated by immunizing BALB/c mice with partially purified PMN leucocyte membrane proteins, and fusing their splenocytes with P 3 X 63 Ag 8 mouse myeloma cells. Hybridoma supernatants were screened initially by binding to PMN leucocyte LTB 4 -R protein, {{which had been}} affinity cross-linked with aminopropylamide (APA) -LTB 4 and immobilized in plastic wells through attachment of the linked APA-LTB 4 to adherent Fab of monoclonal anti-LTB 4. Of the three clones producing antibodies which bound to LTB 4 -R, 0. 5 mg/ml of one IgG 3 k antibody, termed E 2, precipitated over 90 % of the [3 H]LTB 4 -binding activity of solubilized PMN leucocyte membrane proteins. E 2 also bound to a radiolabelled protein of 70, 000 - 80, 000 MW from 125 I-labelled PMN leucocyte membranes [35 S]-labelled HL- 60 cell membranes, and PMN leucocyte membranes affinity-labelled with [3 H]APA-LTB 4, that was identical in size to the LTB 4 -R precipitated by the rabbit IgG anti-idiotypic antibodies. E 2 did not bind to intact PMN leucocytes or modify the binding of [3 H]LTB 4 by PMN leucocytes. The binding of E 2 to LTB 4 -R in purified membranes of PMN leucocytes was less than one-fourth of that observed for the anti-idiotypic antibodies, but increased substantially after solubilization of the LTB 4 -R.

40|$|Leukotrienes (LT) are biologically active {{metabolites}} of arachidonic acid. The {{key enzyme}} in leukotriene biosynthesis is 5 -lipoxygenase (5 -LO). Leukotriene B 4 exerts its biological effect mainly via BLT 1, the high affinity receptor for LTB 4. Leukotriene B 4 {{is a potent}} proinflammatory and <b>chemotactic</b> <b>mediator.</b> Myeloid cells are the main LT producing cells in humans {{and the role of}} LTB 4 in these immune cells is well established. In contrast, the role of LTs in lymphocytes is not fully understood. B lymphocytes express 5 -LO and BLT 1, and activated T cells express BLT 1. In this thesis the biosynthesis and biological function of LTs in human lymphocytes were studied. The role of 5 -LO and LTB 4 in chronic B lymphocytic leukemia cells (B-CLL) was investigated. Treatment of B-CLL cells with CD 40 -ligand resulted in cellular activation as measured by increased expression of cell surface markers (CD 23, CD 54, CD 150) and thymidine incorporation. This activation could be inhibited by LT biosynthesis inhibitors. Addition of exogenous LTB 4 counteracted the inhibitory action of the inhibitors on B-CLL cells. To elucidate the expression of 5 -LO in various subtypes of normal B cells, B cells from tonsils were isolated. Using Western blot, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, it was shown that mantle zone B cells and memory B cells expressed high amounts of 5 -LO. In contrast, germinal center B cells and plasma cells contained low or undetectable amounts of 5 -LO, respectively. Further studies in tumor biopsies from mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients demonstrated high expression of 5 -LO. MCL cell lines also expressed 5 -LO. Studies on the chemical properties of 5 -LO protein in MCL cell lines (Granta 519, JEKO 1, Rec 1) showed that the enzyme was phosphorylated on serine 523. In contrast, native 5 -LO in neutrophils was not phosphorylated on serine 523. Phosphorylated 5 -LO was purified from Rec 1 cells using an ATP-agarose column, and the purified enzyme could be dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase. The MCL cell lines constitutivelyexpressed phosphorylated 5 -LO and this phosphorylation could be induced by activation of protein kinase A. Western blot analysis of biopsies and peripheral blood from patients suffering from MCL or B-CLL demonstrated that these cells also expressed pSer 523 - 5 - LO. We have studied the role of LTB 4 in cellular immune responses. Due to the lack of EBV specific cellular memory, cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) are well suited tostudy immunological interactions during primary EBV infections. Polysaccharide K (PSK) and thioredoxin 80 (Trx 80) are immunostimulating compounds and have been demonstrated to activate T and NK cells which inhibit the proliferation of EBV infected B cells. We have found that LTB 4 activated T cells which in turn inhibited the proliferation of EBV infected B cells. We have also shown that LTB 4 alone is as good as PSK and Trx 80 to inhibit proliferation of EBV infected B cells. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate the expression of 5 -LO in various subtypes of B cells {{and for the first time}} we demonstrate a chemical difference between 5 -LO in B cells (express pSer 523 - 5 -LO) and neutrophils. Furthermore, the importance of LTB 4 in activation of B-CLL cells and in cellular immune responses to EBV infections is also shown...|$|E

Antigen-presenting cells process allergens and present them to Th 2 lymphocytes, which produce IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 13.

In addition, anti-CCL 11 caused a striking inhibition of CD 4 -T-cell influx and shifted cytokine production away from interleukin- 5 without reducing the resistance to viral replication. These results suggest that in addition to influencing eosinophil diapedesis and survival, anti-CCL 11 has an action on T cells.

40|$|Mast {{cells with}} their stores of {{vasoactive}} and <b>chemotactic</b> <b>mediators</b> {{are central to}} the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. The cross-linking of receptorbound IgE molecules on the surface of mast cells initiates a complex chain of events, including calcium ion influx, phospholipid methylation and turnover and cyclic nucleotide metabolism, ultimately resulting in the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity. These mast cell mediators are important in smooth muscle reactivity, in the recruitment of eosinophilic and neutrophilic leukocytes and in the generation of secondary chemical mediators. Histologic evidence of mast cell degranulation, biochemical evidence of mast cell mediators in blood and tissues and clinical evidence of signs and symptoms reproducible by these mediators have strongly supported the crucial role of mast cells in asthma, urticaria, anaphylaxis, rhinitis and mastocytosis. Because of their unique location at host environment interfaces, mast cells may both participate in allergic diseases and promote homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|As {{studied by}} intravital microscopy, mast cell-dependent {{inflammatory}} reactions evoked by antigen or compound 48 / 80 in the hamster cheek pouch involved {{leakage of plasma}} and emigration of leukocytes exclusively from the venules.

In contrast, leukocyte emigration induced by a mast cell-independent stimulus, leukotriene B 4, did not show preferential orientation towards arterioles. Moreover, mast cells were abundant in the hamster cheek pouch, and they were localized predominantly along arterioles, rather than along venules. Because mast cells {{are considered to be}} the source of the <b>chemotactic</b> <b>mediators</b> causing the leukocyte emigration, the periarteriolar mast cell localization may be of functional significance by creating chemotactic gradients between arterioles and venules, thereby promoting oriented and effective interstitial migration of leukocytes.

In addition, clusters of peptidases were seen at the cell surface in flat patches ranging in size from about 60 to 160 nm. Cholesterol depletion of synoviocytes by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin disrupted > 90 % of the caveolae and reduced the raft localization of aminopeptidase N/CD 13 without affecting Ala-p-nitroanilide-cleaving activity of confluent cell cultures. In co-culture experiments with T-lymphocytes, cholesterol depletion of synoviocytes greatly reduced their capability to induce an early lymphocytic expression of aminopeptidase N/CD 13. We propose caveolae/rafts to be peptidase-rich 'hot-spot' regions of the synoviocyte plasma membrane required for functional cell-cell interactions with lymphocytes.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigate}} whether mast cells and macrophages {{are involved in}} the control of IL- 1 beta-induced neutrophil migration, as well as the participation of <b>chemotactic</b> <b>mediators.</b> IL- 1 beta induced a dose-dependent neutrophil migration to the peritoneal cavity of rats which depends on LTB 4, PAF and cytokines, since the animal treatment with inhibitors of these mediators (MK 886, PCA 4248 and dexamethasone respectively) inhibited IL- 1 beta-induced neutrophil migration. The neutrophil migration induced by IL- 1 beta is dependent on mast cells and macrophages, since depletion of mast cells reduced the process whereas the increase of macrophage population enhanced the migration. Moreover, mast cells or macrophages stimulated with IL- 1 beta released a neutrophil chemotactic factor, which mimicked the neutrophil migration induced by IL- 1 beta. The chemotactic activity of the supernatant of IL- 1 beta-stimulated macrophages is due to the presence of LTB 4, since MK 886 inhibited its release. Moreover, the chemotactic activity of IL- 1 beta-stimulated mast cells supernatant is due to the presence of IL- 1 beta and TNF-alpha, since antibodies against these cytokines inhibited its activity. Furthermore, significant amounts of these cytokines were detected in the supernatant. In conclusion, our results suggest that neutrophil migration induced by IL- 1 beta depends upon LTB 4 released by macrophages and upon IL- 1 beta and TNF alpha released by mast cells...|$|R

A comprehensive literature search in the PubMed database was performed and articles were identified that showed increased plasma levels of mediators where the increase was solely attributable to mechanical ventilation. A subsequent search revealed articles delineating the potential effects of each mediator on the kidney or kidney cells. Limited research has focused specifically {{on the relationship between}} mechanical ventilation and acute kidney injury. Only a limited number of plasma mediators has been implicated in mechanical ventilation-associated acute kidney injury. The number of mediators released during mechanical ventilation is far greater and includes pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, but also mediators involved in coagulation, fibrinolysis, cell adhesion, apoptosis and cell growth. The potential effects of these mediators is pleiotropic and include effects on inflammation, cell recruitment, adhesion and infiltration, apoptosis and necrosis, vasoactivity, cell proliferation, coagulation and fibrinolysis, transporter regulation, lipid metabolism and cell signaling. Most research has focused on inflammatory and <b>chemotactic</b> <b>mediators.</b> There is a great disparity of knowledge of potential effects on the kidney between different mediators. From a theoretical point of view, the systemic release of several mediators induced by mechanical ventilation may {{play an important role in}} the pathophysiology of acute kidney injury. However, evidence supporting a causal relationship is lacking for the studied mediators...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBreast cancer {{metastasis}} to the bone, potentially facilitated by chemotactic and angiogenic cytokines, {{contributes to a}} dramatic osteolytic effect associated with this invasive behavior. Based on the intrinsic ability of calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) to control hormonal secretion and considering its expression in the breast, we hypothesized that CaSR plays a chemotactic and proangiogenic role in highly invasive MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cells by promoting secretion of multiple cytokines. In this study, we show that MDA-MB- 231 cells stimulated with R- 568 calcimimetic and extracellular calcium secreted multiple cytokines and growth factors that induced endothelial cell migration and in vitro angiogenesis. These effects were dependent on the activity of CaSR {{as demonstrated by the}} inhibitory effect of either anti-CaSR blocking monoclonal antibodies or calcilytic NPS- 2143. Moreover, CaSR knockdown prevented the proangiogenic effect of CaSR agonists. Importantly, CaSR promoted secretion of pleiotropic molecules like GM-CSF, EGF, MDC/CCL 22, FGF- 4 and IGFBP 2, all known to be <b>chemotactic</b> <b>mediators</b> with putative angiogenic factor properties. In contrast, constitutive secretion of IL- 6 and Î²-NGF was attenuated by CaSR. In the case of normal mammary cells, secretion of IL- 6 was stimulated by CaSR, whereas a constitutive secretion of RANTES, Angiogenin and Oncostatin M was attenuated by this receptor. Taken together, our results indicate that an altered secretion of chemotactic and proangiogenic cytokines in breast cancer cells is modulated by CaSR, which can be considered a potential target in the therapy of metastatic breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} whether saliva from Phlebotomus papatasi and Phlebotomus duboscqi inhibited antigen-induced neutrophil migration and the mechanisms {{involved in these}} effects. The pretreatment of immunized mice with salivary gland extracts (SGE) of both phlebotomines inhibited OVA challenge-induced neutrophil migration and release of the neutrophil <b>chemotactic</b> <b>mediators,</b> MIP- 1 alpha, TNF-alpha, and leukotriene B- 4 (LTB 4). Furthermore, SGE treatment enhanced the production of anti-inflammatory mediators, IL- 10 and PGE(2). SGE treatments failed to inhibit neutrophil migration and MIP- 1 alpha and LTB 4 production in IL- 10 (-/-) mice, also failing in mice treated with nonselective (indomethacin) or selective (rofecoxibe) cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors. COX inhibition resulted in diminished SGE-induced IL- 10 production, and PGE(2) release triggered by SGE remained increased in IL- 10 (-/-) mice, suggesting that prostanoids are acting through an IL- 10 -dependent mechanism. SGE treatments in vivo reduced the OVA-induced lymphoproliferation of spleen-derived cells. Further, the in vitro incubation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC) with SGE inhibited the proliferation of CD 4 (+) T cells from OVA-immunized mice, which was reversed by indomethacin and anti-IL- 10 antibody treatments. Supporting these results, SGE induced the production of PGE(2) and IL- 10 by DC, which were blocked by COX inhibition. These effects {{were associated with the}} reduction of DC-membrane expression of MHC-II and CD 86 by SGE treatment. Altogether, the results showed that Phlebotomine saliva inhibits immune inflammation-induced neutrophil migration by an autocrine DC sequential production of PGE(2) /IL- 10, suggesting that the saliva constituents might be promising therapeutic molecules to target immune inflammatory diseases...|$|R
40|$|AbstractT {{lymphocytes}} {{are critical}} cells involved in allergy. Here, {{we report that}} the natural tetranortriterpenoid gedunin impaired allergic responses primarily by modulating T lymphocyte functions. The intraperitoneal (i. p.) administration of gedunin inhibited pleural leukocyte accumulation triggered by intra-pleural (i. pl.) challenge with ovalbumin (OVA) in previously sensitized C 57 BL/ 6 mice; this inhibition was primarily due to the impairment of eosinophil and T lymphocyte influx. Likewise, i. pl. pre-treatment with gedunin inhibited eosinophil and T lymphocyte migration into mouse lungs 24 h after OVA intra-nasal (i. n.) instillation. Pre-treatment with gedunin diminished the levels of CCL 2, CCL 3, CCL 5, CCL 11, Interleukin- 5 and leukotriene B 4 at the allergic site. In vitro pre-treatment with gedunin failed to inhibit T lymphocyte adhesion and chemotaxis towards pleural washes recovered from OVA-challenged mice, suggesting that gedunin inhibits T lymphocyte migration in vivo via the inhibition of <b>chemotactic</b> <b>mediators</b> in situ. In vivo pre-treatment with gedunin reduced the numbers of CD 69 + and CD 25 + T lymphocytes in the pleura and CD 25 + cells in the thoracic lymph nodes 24 h after OVA i. pl. challenge. In accordance, in vitro treatment of T lymphocytes with gedunin inhibited Î±-CD 3 mAb-induced expression of CD 69 and CD 25, proliferation, Interleukin- 2 production and nuclear translocation of NFÎºB and NFAT. Notably, post-treatment of mice with gedunin reverted OVA-induced lung allergic inflammation by decreasing the T lymphocyte and eosinophil counts and the levels of eosinophilotactic mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Our results demonstrate a remarkable anti-allergic effect of gedunin due to its capability to modulate T cell activation and trafficking into the airways...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chronic {{urticaria}} (CU) is {{a common}} disease characterized by recurrent itchy wheals and/or angioedema for more than 6 weeks. We aimed to investigate the potential involvement of <b>chemotactic</b> <b>mediators</b> and soluble adhesion molecules as markers of endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). The potential relevance of these soluble mediators {{in the evaluation of}} disease activity was also investigated. Methods: We measured the levels of CCL 5 /RANTES, CXCL 8 /IL- 8, sVCAM- 1, and sICAM- 1 in the sera of 87 patients with CSU and 61 normal healthy subjects (NHS) using ELISA assays. According to the results of autologous serum skin tests (ASST), CSU patients were classified into ASST-positive and ASST-negative subgroups. Furthermore, we investigated in 4 patients whether H 1 -antihistamine therapy decreases sVCAM- 1 and sICAM- 1 levels. Results: We detected a significantly higher concentration of CCL 5 /RANTES (p < 0. 0001) but not of CXCL 8 /IL- 8 in CSU patients compared to NHS. The serum levels of sICAM- 1 and sVCAM- 1 were significantly increased in CSU patients compared to NHS (p = 0. 0121 and p = 0. 0043, respectively). No difference in chemokine or soluble adhesion molecule levels was detected between the ASST-positive and ASST-negative subgroups. A positive correlation was found between sICAM- 1 and sVCAM- 1 (p = 0. 0022) but not between these and CCL 5 /RANTES. After H 1 -antihistamine therapy, sVCAM- 1 and sICAM- 1 levels did not decrease in the 4 CSU patients tested. Conclusions: Our study suggests that CCL 5 /RANTES, sICAM- 1, and sVCAM- 1 play a potential role in the pathogenesis of CSU but they do not parallel disease activity and are not predictive of the response to H 1 - antihistamine therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{inflammatory}} milieu favors {{recruitment and}} activation of osteoclasts, {{and leads to}} bone destruction as a serious complication associated with arthritis and with other inflammatory processes. The frequency and activity of osteoclast progenitors (OCPs) correspond to arthritis severity, and {{may be used to}} monitor disease progression and bone resorption, indicating the need for detailed characterization of the discrete OCP subpopulations. Collectively, current studies suggest that the most potent murine bone marrow OCP population can be identified among lymphoid negative population within the immature myeloid lineage cells, as B 220 (-) CD 3 (-) CD 11 b(-/lo) CD 115 (+) CD 117 (+) CX 3 CR 1 (+) and possibly also Ter 119 (-) CD 11 c(-) CD 135 (lo) Ly 6 C(+) RANK(-). In peripheral blood the OCP population bears the monocytoid phenotype B 220 (-) CD 3 (-) NK 1. 1 (-) CD 11 b(+) Ly 6 C(hi) CD 115 (+) CX 3 CR 1 (+), presumably expressing RANK in committed OCPs. Much less is known about human OCPs and their regulation in arthritis, but the circulating OCP subset is, most probably, comprised among the lymphoid negative population (CD 3 (-) CD 19 (-) CD 56 (-)), within immature monocyte subset (CD 11 b(+) CD 14 (+) CD 16 (-)), expressing receptors for M-CSF and RANKL (CD 115 (+) RANK(+)). Our preliminary data confirmed positive association between the proportion of peripheral blood OCPs, defined as CD 3 (-) CD 19 (-) CD 56 (-) CD 11 b(+) CD 14 (+), and the disease activity score (DAS 28) in the follow-up samples from patients with psoriatic arthritis receiving anti-TNF therapy. In addition, we reviewed cytokines and chemokines which, directly or indirectly, activate OCPs and enhance their differentiation potential, thus mediating osteoresorption. Control of the activity and migratory behaviour of OCPs as well as the identification of crucial bone/joint <b>chemotactic</b> <b>mediators</b> represent promising therapeutic targets in arthritis...|$|R
40|$|Microscopic colitis (MC), {{comprising}} collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) is {{a common}} cause of chronic watery diarrhea. The diagnosis relies on typical histopathological changes observed upon microscopic examination. The studies in this thesis investigated innate and adaptive immune responses in the colonic mucosa of MC patients, also comparing patients with active disease (CC and LC) and histopathologically in remission (CC/LC-HR). We first analyzed expression of interleukin- 1 /Toll-like receptor (IL- 1 /TLR) signaling regulators in MC patients (Paper I). Our results showed enhanced IRAK-M, microRNA- 146 a, - 155 and - 21 expressions, whereas IL- 37 gene expression was reduced in CC and LC patients as compared to non-inflamed controls. These results suggest different pathophysiological mechanisms in MC patients. The mixed inflammatory cell infiltrations seen in the lamina propria of MC patients might {{be a result of}} dysregulated expression of <b>chemotactic</b> <b>mediators.</b> In Paper II, we showed that MC patients display mainly an increased expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors in active disease as compared to noninflamed controls. In Paper III, we examined if the decreased IL- 37 expression seen in Paper I could mediate the upregulation of chemokines seen in Paper II. We showed that a relatively small reduction in the ability of epithelial cells to produce IL- 37 results in mainly increased chemokine expressions in a pattern similar to the findings in Paper II. In order {{to understand the nature of}} infiltrating T cells commonly observed in MC patients, we analyzed the T cell receptor (TCR) Î² chains in colonic biopsies of MC patients (Paper IV). Our results showed significant differences in TCRÎ² repertoire, which suggests selectively expanded T cell clones in active MC and histopathologically in remission patients. Altogether, these results i) increase the knowledge of MC pathogenesis by showing changes in TLR signaling regulators, enhanced chemokine and their receptor expressions involved in a mixed immune cell infiltrations and selectively expanded T cell clones in CC and LC patients, as well as in histopathological remission ii) might potentially increase the possibility of more target-specific therapies based on IL- 37 induction, chemokines or chemokine receptor inhibitions, or hindering T cell infiltration according to TCR clonality...|$|R
40|$|Joint {{arthroplasty}} had {{revolutionized the}} outcome of orthopaedic surgery. Extensive and collaborative work of many innovator surgeons had {{led to the development}} of durable bearing surfaces, yet no single material is considered absolutely perfect. Generation of wear debris from any part of the prosthesis is unavoidable. Implant loosening secondary to osteolysis is the most common mode of failure of arthroplasty. Osteolysis is the resultant of complex contribution of the generated wear debris and the mechanical instability of the prosthetic components. Roughly speaking, all orthopedic biomaterials may induce a universal biologic host response to generated wear dÃ©bris with little specific characteristics for each material; but some debris has been shown to be more cytotoxic than others. Prosthetic wear debris induces an extensive biological cascade of adverse cellular responses, where macrophages are the main cellular type involved in this hostile inflammatory process. Macrophages cause osteolysis indirectly by releasing numerous <b>chemotactic</b> inflammatory <b>mediators,</b> and directly by resorbing bone with their membrane microstructures. The bio-reactivity of wear particles depends on two major elements: particle characteristics (size, concentration and composition) and host characteristics. While any particle type may enhance hostile cellular reaction, cytological examination demonstrated that more than 70 % of the debris burden is constituted of polyethylene particles. Comprehensive understanding of the intricate process of osteolysis is of utmost importance for future development of therapeutic modalities that may delay or prevent the disease progression...|$|R
40|$|Este estudo teve por objetivos: a) caracterizar o influxo de leucÃ³citos (LC) induzido pelo veneno de Bothrops moojeni (VBm); b) avaliar o papel dos mastÃ³citos (MC) e da histamina neste evento; c) analisar a liberaÃ§Ã£o de TXA 2, PGD 2, LTB 4, MCP- 1 e KC e d) avaliar a capacidade do VBm desgranular MC in vivo e in vitro. A injeÃ§Ã£o {{intraperitoneal}} de VBm, em camundongos, causou o recrutamento de LC e neutrofilia. O tratamento dos animais com cromoglicato aboliu o influxo de LC enquanto a difenidramina, ranitidina e a tioperamida, antagonistas da histamina, reduziram o influxo de neutrÃ³filos. Ainda, o veneno induziu a liberaÃ§Ã£o de PGD 2, TXA 2, LTB 4, MCP- 1 e de KC e causou a desgranulaÃ§Ã£o de MC in vivo e a liberaÃ§Ã£o de -hexosaminidase de MC in vitro. Em conclusÃ£o, o VBm induz influxo de LC para o local de sua injeÃ§Ã£o. Este efeito depende da histamina, via receptores H 1, H 2 e H 4 e da desgranulaÃ§Ã£o de MC, que decorre de aÃ§Ã£o direta do veneno nestas cÃ©lulas. A neutrofilia e o TXA 2, LTB 4, MCP- 1 e KC devem contribuir para o influxo de leucÃ³citos causado pelo VBm. In {{this study}} {{the effects of}} Bothrops moojeni venom (BmV) on the cellular component of inflammatory responses and the mechanisms involved in this effect were investigated. The effects of venom on peritoneal and circulating leukocyte numbers and on the release of inflammatory mediators, such as LTB 4, TXA 2, PGD 2, MIP- 1 and KC, were assessed. The role of both mast cells and histamine receptors in leukocyte recruitment induced by BmV was assessed by selected pharmacological treatments. BmV caused a marked infiltration of leukocytes (3 - 24 h) when injected into the peritoneal cavity of mice. Neutrophils (PMN) were the predominant cell type {{in the early stages of}} response whereas macrophages (MN) were accumulated from 3 up to 24 h. Moreover, BmV increased blood neutrophil numbers at 3 h after injection. The BmV-induced leukocyte influx was abrogated by cromoglicate and significantly reduced either by difenidramine or ranitidine or tioperamide, histamine H 1, H 2 and H 4 receptor antagonists, respectively, at 6 h after injection. Significant increments in peritoneal levels of LTB 4, TXA 2, PGD 2, MIP- 1 and KC were detected at distinct periods of time after venom injection. In addition, BmV induced mast cell degranulation both in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, obtained data demonstrated the ability of BmV induce leukocyte recruitment into the site of its injection. This effect is dependent on mast cell activation and degranulation, which may be due to a direct effect of venom on these cells, and is mediated at least in part by histamine via H 1, H 2 and H 4 receptors. Moreover, the ability of venom to mobilize leukocytes from bone marrow reserve compartments and to release the <b>chemotactic</b> <b>mediators</b> TXA 2, LTB 4, MCP- 1 and KC may be relevant for leukocyte infiltration...|$|R
40|$|Mast {{cells are}} present in human lung tissue, {{pulmonary}} epithelium, and free in the bronchial lumen. By virtue of their location and their possession of specific receptors for IgE and complement fragments, these cells are sentinel cells in host defense. The preformed granular mediators and newly generated lipid mediators liberated upon activation of mast cells {{by a variety of}} secretagogues supply potent vasoactivespasmogenic <b>mediators,</b> <b>chemotactic</b> factors, active enzymes, and proteoglycans to the local environment. These factors acting together induce an immediate response manifest as edema, smooth muscle constriction, mucus production, and cough. Later these mediators and those provided from plasma and leukocytes generate a tissue infiltrate of inflammatory cells and more prolonged vasoactive-bronchospastic responses. Acute and prolonged responses may be homeostatic and provide for defense of the host, but if excessive in degree or duration may provide a chronic inflammatory substrate upon which such disorders as asthma and pulmonary fibrosis may ensue...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{driving force}} in the {{progression}} of COPD {{is the development of}} exacerbations which are mostly the result of excessive inflammation. Bronchodilatators {{play an important role in}} the treatment of COPD. The reported reduction in exacerbation rates in COPD is due to the inhibition of vagal-mediated bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion. However, recent studies have highlighted the existence of muscarinic receptors on inflammatory cells and we have explored the possibility that tiotropium bromide might also inhibit neutrophil migration. We analysed the influence of tiotropium on the release of neutrophil chemotactic activity in response to acetylcholine (ACh) and the expression of muscarinic receptors on human alveolar macrophages (AM), A 549 cells, MonoMac 6 cells, and human lung fibroblasts. We found significant levels of all muscarinic receptor subtypes on all analysed cells except the fibroblasts. Fibroblasts expressed predominantly M 2, receptors and did not release chemotactic activity. AM, A 549 cells, and MonoMac 6 cells released <b>chemotactic</b> active <b>mediators</b> after incubation with ACh. The secretion could be suppressed by more than 70 % after coincubation with tiotropium. Tiotropium alone did not influence the granulocyte migration. Most of the chemotactic activity could be attributed to leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4). The release of interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) and monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1) was not induced by ACh. From this, we suggest that the suppression of the Ach-mediated release of chemotactic substances like LTB 4 modulates the inflammatory reaction. This may contribute to the decreased rate of exacerbations in COPD, which was observed in clinical trials...|$|R
