5|$|After Banner, Briskin {{returned}} to work at Columbia Pictures, where he began producing for them in 1926, and in 1928 he was given control over 18 of their productions. By 1929, Briskin had risen to be a top executive at the studio, sharing honors with studio head Harry Cohn, in giving the <b>closing</b> <b>address</b> at Columbia's annual sales meeting in July 1929. By the end of 1929, Briskin was the assistant general manager of Columbia, and {{on a visit to}} New York City signed several Broadway playwrights to long-term contracts with the studio, including Elmer Harris, Jo Swerling, and Paul Hervey Fox. Not only was Briskin active in the production office at Columbia, but he also played on Columbia's baseball team, which competed in the Motion Picture Baseball League. It was while working at Columbia that Briskin met Frank Capra. In 1930, Briskin's brother Irving, who he had employed while at Banner, joined him as a producer at Columbia.|$|E

500|$|Tillman was his state's {{favorite}} son candidate, and its representative on the Committee on Resolutions (often called [...] "the Platform Committee"). The platform {{had the support}} of the pro-silver majority of the committee, but the gold minority, led by New York Senator David B. Hill, opposed its support of free silver, and wanted to take the disagreement to the convention floor. With one hour and fifteen minutes allocated to each side, Tillman and Bryan were selected as the speakers in favor of the draft platform. Bryan asked Tillman if he wanted to open or close the debate; the senator wanted to close, but sought fifty minutes to do so. The Nebraskan replied that Hill would oppose such a long <b>closing</b> <b>address,</b> and Tillman agreed to open the debate, with Bryan to close it.|$|E
500|$|The closing ceremony, {{before a}} near-capacity crowd of 3,500, had the colour of the opening, with 35 marching bands (400 girls) and Scottish bands. The crowd {{had been present}} for the {{recently}} completed basketball final game. A DC-7B aircraft, chartered by the British teams, conducted a fly past. Sir Ludwig Guttman, founder of the Paralympic Games, in his <b>closing</b> <b>address,</b> thanked Australia and stated that [...] "What {{has been the most}} gratifying achievement is that the First Commonwealth Paraplegic Games have fulfilled the aims and ideals of the Stoke Mandeville Games in furthering friendship and understanding among various nations of the Commonwealth." [...] Guttman presented Dr George Bedbrook with the Stoke Mandeville pennant in recognition for the organisation of the Games. [...] Each team then wheeled past the dais to the famous Australian song [...] "Waltzing Matilda". Dr Sir Arthur Porritt, Chairman of the British Empire and Commonwealth Games Federation, declared the Games closed. In his speech, he told the audience that he hoped the general public would continue to support paraplegics and their movement.|$|E
500|$|Good luck favored Bryan—he was {{considered}} for various convention roles by the silverites, {{but each time}} was not selected. The temporary chairmanship, for example, would have permitted him to deliver the keynote address. However, Bryan, lacking {{a seat at the}} start of the convention, could not be elected temporary chairman. [...] Bryan considered this no loss at all; the focus of the convention was on the party platform and the debate which would precede its adoption. The platform would symbolize the repudiation of Cleveland and his policies after the insurgents' long struggle, and Bryan was determined to close the debate on the platform. Bryan, once seated, was Nebraska's representative to the Committee on Resolutions (generally called the [...] "platform committee"), which allocated 80minutes to each side in the debate and selected Bryan as one of the speakers. South Carolina Senator Benjamin Tillman was to be the other pro-silver speaker, and originally wished to close the debate. However, the senator wanted 50 minutes to speak, too long for a <b>closing</b> <b>address,</b> and at Bryan's request agreed to open the debate instead. [...] Accordingly, Bryan became the final speaker on the platform.|$|E

500|$|The case {{initially}} {{appeared to}} be going badly for Marshall-Hall. An inept cross-examination on his part weakened his argument, and an illness made him irritable and short-tempered. On {{the advice of his}} clerk, he asked Birkett to make the <b>closing</b> <b>address</b> before the court, which turned the mood of the courtroom completely and an initially hostile jury decided to disregard the agreement of Mr. Dennistoun to pay ancillary relief to his former wife. Birkett's performance made the front pages of many evening newspapers, including The Daily Mail which described Birkett as [...] "the greatest legal discovery of the year" [...] and called his speech [...] "a brilliant piece of advocacy". His work for this case and the newspaper coverage of it brought him to the attention of many London solicitors, and led to him earning £8,000 in the first seven months of 1925. In that year he made £12,000 overall, an amount which rose to £16,500 in 1926 and peaked in 1929 when he earned £33,500. On meeting Miles Malleson, an old friend from his time at Cambridge, he said in surprise [...] "did you know, Miles, that I am making more money than I thought existed in the world!" ...|$|E
500|$|Once seated, Bryan {{went to the}} Platform Committee {{meeting at}} the Palmer House, {{displacing}} the Nebraska gold delegate on the committee. [...] The proposed platform was pro-silver; Senator Hill had offered an amendment backing the gold standard, which had been defeated by committee vote. [...] As Hill was determined to take the platform fight to the full convention, the committee discussed who should speak in the debate, and allocated 75minutes to each side. [...] South Carolina Senator Benjamin Tillman, a silver supporter, wanted an hour to address the convention, and to close the debate. [...] When both Hill and Bryan (who {{was selected as the}} other pro-silver speaker) objected to such a long <b>closing</b> <b>address,</b> Tillman settled for 50minutes and for opening the debate rather than closing it; Bryan was given 25minutes to close. [...] Bryan later asked the Platform Committee chairman, Arkansas Senator James K. Jones why he was given such a crucial role as closing the platform debate; Senator Jones responded that he had three reasons: Bryan's long service in the silver cause, the Nebraskan was the only major speaker not to have addressed the convention, and that Jones had a sore throat. [...] That evening, Bryan dined with his wife and with friends. [...] Looking upon the loud Boies and Bland supporters, Bryan commented, [...] "These people don't know it, but they will be cheering for me just this way tomorrow night." ...|$|E
