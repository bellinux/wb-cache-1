40|$|The {{behavioural}} {{response of}} downstream moving European eel (Anguilla anguilla) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) to velocity gradients created by orifice weirs {{placed in a}} flume were studied. The aim was to identify interspecific variation and test two hypotheses: (1) a more abrupt velocity gradient would induce a higher avoidance response and over a greater distance, and (2) fish would acclimate to the velocity gradient by incrementally sampling conditions closer to the orifice until successful passage occurred. European eel moved along the <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> and walls, responding after physical contact with the weir. Brown trout moved downstream head first and switched orientation at the velocity gradient without contacting the structure. Brown trout spent longer than European eel immediately upstream of a <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> orifice, although time to pass was similar; but less time at a mid-column orifice despite taking longer to pass. The mid-column orifice delayed both species longer. European eel passed orifices head first on initial encounter with no rejections, whereas brown trout passed tail first. Positions where brown trout first switched orientation and closest point to the orifice reached during initial approach occurred closer to a <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> than mid-column treatment. Brown trout {{did not appear to}} acclimate to the velocity gradient by sampling successively closer to the orifice.

40|$|Mendocino Channel, a deep-water sinuous channel {{located along}} {{the base of}} Gorda Escarpment, was {{for the first time}} {{completely}} mapped with a multibeam echosounder. This study uses newly acquired multibeam bathymetry and backscatter, together with supporting multichannel seismic and sediment core data to quantitatively describe the morphometry of the entire Mendocino Channel and to explore the age and possible causes that {{may have contributed to the}} formation and maintenance of the channel. The first 42 km of the channel is a linear reach followed for the next 83. 8 km by a sinuous reach. The sinuous reach has a sinuosity index of 1. 66 before it changes back to a linear reach for the next 22. 2 km. A second sinuous reach is 40. 2 km long and the two reaches are separated by a crevasse splay and a large landslide that deflected the channel northwest towards Gorda Basin. Both sinuous reaches have oxbow bends, cut-off meanders, interior and exterior terraces and extensive levee systems. The lower sinuous reach becomes more linear for the next 22. 2 km before the channel relief falls below the resolution of the data. Levees suddenly decrease in height above the <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> mid-way along the lower linear reach close to where the channel makes a 90 Â° turn to the southwest.

40|$|The Shimanto River, in the {{southwest}} of Shikoku Island, forms incised meanders. It {{has been suggested that}} gorges are formed as meanders incise bedrock during tectonic uplift, or a lowering of the baselevel of erosion. However, it is known that the formation of incised meanders is dependent on many other factors. The Shimanto River is composed of a main stream and two major tributaries. Incised meanders occur especially in the middle section of the main stream. It is clear that scarcely any lateral erosion occurs here, as the meanders have very small terraces. The study site is located in the Shimanto Belt, which is composed of interbedded sandstone and mudstone. The sandstone is resistant to erosion, but the mudstone is easily eroded and transported by the river in suspension. There is little sediment load in the river because the area has not experienced recent uplift. Also, since the sediment load is mainly mud, there is very little bedload in the river, which results in a rough, bedrock <b>channel</b> <b>floor.</b> It is proposed that the lack of bedload supplied to the channel and the rough <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> influence the lateral erosion of the channel and lead to the formation of incised meanders. To test this hypothesis, a flume experiment was conducted using a channel with fixed meanders and varying degrees of roughness of the channel bed. It was found that the greater the roughness of the channel bed, the weaker the concentration of streampower at meanders. It is therefore concluded that little lateral erosion is produced at channel bends over a rough bed. It seems likely that incised meanders are formed in the middle section of the Shimanto River because there is little bedload in the channel, resulting in a very rough, bedrock <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> and a reduction in the efficient streampower for cutting banks erosion at the bends. This in turn reduces lateral erosion...|$|R

40|$|A {{debris flow}} {{occurred}} in the Tsugaru Juniko Lakes area, NE Japan, due to localized torrential downpour on 29 August, 2005. The debris flow started from a talus cone near {{the east side of}} Mt. Ookuzure and flowed down through a very small valley. Finally lobe deposits that are characterized by unsorted, disorganized and reverse graded gravelly deposits with wood chips were formed near the east side of Lake Ketobanoike. The debris flow also formed disorganized and/or reverse graded gravelly deposits beside a channel as natural levee deposits. These sedimentary aspects of the deposits indicate that the flow should be classified as a stony debris flow. The debris which derived from talus breccia were transported by debris flow and mainly deposited in {{the upper part of the}} valley near talus breccia as <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> deposits or <b>channel</b> levee deposits. The debris which formed lobe deposits in the terminal point of the debris flow deposits are mainly composed of large sized boulders derived from <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> deposits which originated further down the valley.

40|$|The {{behavioural}} {{response of}} downstream migrating nonsalmonid fish to hydraulic conditions associated with river infrastructure is poorly understood. The response of downstream migrating adult European eels (Anguilla anguilla) to bar racks (12 ?mm bar spacing) angled on the {{vertical and horizontal}} planes under different flow regimes and during periods of darkness was assessed. Eels predominantly moved along the <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> and wall, tending to follow routes where turbulence intensity was high. Time taken to approach the racks was greater than expected if fish had moved passively with the flow. Eels did not exhibit clear avoidance behaviour prior to encountering the racks, instead marked changes in behaviour occurred only after physical contact was made with the structure. No impingement or passage through the racks occurred, and passes per approach were high (98. 3 %), when vertical racks were angled 15 Â°, 30 Â° or 45 Â° relative to the flow. Impingement and passage through the racks only occurred when horizontally inclined racks were placed perpendicular to the flow. The time eels were impinged on the racks was negatively related to discharge when angled at 30 Â° relative to the <b>channel</b> <b>floor,</b> and positively related when upright. Frequency of impingement was higher under low discharge (132. 9 ?Â±? 16. 6 ?lÂ·s? 1). Impinged eels escaped from racks at approach velocities of 0. 90 ?Â±? 0. 05 ?mÂ·s? 1.

40|$|Methods used so far {{to assess}} the flow {{velocities}} of the water commonly assumed {{to be responsible for}} forming the major outflow channel systems on Mars have relied widely on various versions of the Manning equation. This has led to problems in allowing for the difference between the accelerations due to gravity on Mars and Earth and for the differences of scale between Martian floods and most river systems on Earth. We reanalyze the problem of estimating water flow velocities in Martian outflow channels using equations based on the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor instead of the Manning n factor. We give simplified formulae appropriate to Mars for the Darcy-Weisbach friction coefficient as a function of bedrock size distribution. For a given <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> slope and water flood depth, similar mean flow velocities are implied {{for a wide range of}} values of the ratio of bed roughness to water depth relevant to Martian outflow channels. Using a recent rederivation of Manning's equation based on turbulence theory, we obtain a new value of 0. 0545 s mâ 1 / 3 for the Manning n coefficient appropriate to Martian channels and show that previous analyses have generally overestimated (though in some cases underestimated) water flow velocities on Mars by a factor of order two. Combining the consequences of this flow velocity overestimate with likely overestimates of flow depth from assuming bank-full flow, we show that discharges may have been overestimated by a factor of up to 25, leading to corresponding overestimates of subsurface aquifer permeabilities, rates of filling of depressions with water, and grain sizes of sediments on <b>channel</b> <b>floors.</b> Despite the availability of an improved value for the Manning n coefficient for Mars, we strongly recommend that modified forms of the original version of the Manning equation should be replaced by the modern form or, preferably, by the Darcy-Weisbach equation in future work...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The Beaufort Formation (probably of Pliocene age) exposed on Prince Patrick Island in {{the western}} Canadian Arctic Islands is an unlithified and poorly exposed unit {{consisting}} of the following assemblage of facies: A) clast-supported gravel (<b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> lags, longitudinal bars); B) cross-bedded sand (transverse bars, <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> dunes); C) rippled sand; D) horizontally laminated fines- mixed sand, silt and woody detritus; E) clay-rich mud (overbank suspension deposits); and F) woody plant detritus, beds of flat-lying logs, sticks, twigs, wood chips, bark, leaves, needles, seeds, and moss (overbank suspension and traction deposits). Minor facies include pebble bands, plane laminated sand, and a thin bouldery basal gravel horizon. The sediments are interpreted to be sandy braided river deposits that are notable for their egionally abundant beds of coarse woody detritus, a feature uncommon in most ancient braided fluvial deposits. Facies A to C represent bar and channel deposits, with Facies B the most abundant. Facies C to F are relatively minor and are interpreted as low-stage overbank deposits such as abandoned channel fills. Rapid, small-scale lateral facies changes are the norm. Well-defined fining-upward sequences 1. 2 - 2. 5 m thick are uncommon. The relative rarity, thinness, and lateral impersistence of overbank facies compared to bar-channel facies suggests that significant amounts of meandering river deposits are not present. The common allochthonous woody fossils were sourced from boreal forests nearby. A thin horizon in one stratigraphic section contains tidal bundles with slack water mud drapes.

40|$|A large palaeochannel on {{the northeastern}} Australian {{continental}} shelf has been imaged {{by a series}} of shallow seismic reflection profiles. The buried channel forms an important Pleistocene route of the Burdekin River and extends almost continuously for not, vert, similar 160 km from the present coast to the outermost reef. The <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> profile steps across the shelf with alternating segments of gentle gradient (flats) and steeper gradient (ramps). Channel sinuosity as interpreted from seismic records varies among segments between 1 and 1. 72, with no consistent relationship between sinuosity and gradient. The lower and upper parts of the channel fill have different geometry and reflection character, suggesting channel excavation and initial filling occurred during a different regime than final filling. In one section of the shelf, about the â 50 m isobath, the channel is difficult to define and appears to have wandered significantly, either because it has been modified by shoreface erosion ca. 10. 5 ka or because the river encountered a change in topography in front of karstified reefs. As the channel passes between the numerous outer shelf reefs, in water depths of 70 â 80 m, it becomes progressively smaller, conspicuously underfilled, and absent entirely over the outermost 10 km of the shelf. No discrete lowstand river mouth could be recognised on the present shelf edge. The elevations of flat segments on the <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> profile show considerable similarity to published elevations of stillstands or brief rises in sea level attained during the long-term drawdown associated with the last glacial cycle (125 â 20 ka) and are interpreted to have formed during this stepwise drop in sea level.
