50|$|In {{each country}} {{there are five}} stages of {{education}}: early years, primary, secondary, further education (FE) and higher education (HE). The law states that full time education is compulsory for all {{children between the ages}} of 5 (4 in Northern Ireland) and 16, the <b>compulsory</b> <b>school</b> <b>age</b> (CSA). In England, compulsory education or training has been extended to 18 for those born on or after 1 September 1997.

Before they reach <b>compulsory</b> <b>school</b> <b>age,</b> children can be educated at nursery if parents wish though there is only limited government funding for such places. Further Education is non-compulsory, and covers non-advanced education which can be taken at further (including tertiary) education colleges and Higher Education institutions (HEIs). The fifth stage, Higher Education, is study beyond A levels or BTECs (and their equivalent) which, for most full-time students, takes place in universities and other Higher Education institutions and colleges.|$|E

This tallies with a finding from other studies: the families with the least experience of education are particularly sensitive to assessments by the school, and considerably lower their tracking expectations or overall ambition as soon as their child shows “learning difficulties”. By contrast, the most educated families tend to maintain their high level of ambition even when their child experiences difficulties.

Using this index, a growth accounting exercise is conducted to estimate the impact of human capital accumulation on economic growth {{over the past two decades}}.
