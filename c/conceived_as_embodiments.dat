25|$|Dionysus has {{remained}} {{an inspiration to}} artists, philosophers and writers into the modern era. In The Birth of Tragedy (1872), the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche proposed that a tension between Apollonian and Dionysian aesthetic principles underlay the development of Greek tragedy; Dionysus represented what was unrestrained chaotic and irrational, while Apollo represented the rational and ordered. Nietzsche claimed that the oldest forms of Greek Tragedy were entirely based on suffering of Dionysus. In Nietzsche's 1886 work Beyond Good and Evil, and later works The Twilight of the Idols, The Antichrist and Ecce Homo, Dionysus is <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> the <b>embodiment</b> of the unrestrained will to power.|$|R
40|$|Leiden University was <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> the <b>embodiment</b> of {{specifically}} academic ethics {{which sought}} to improve society through a cumulative process of knowledge acquisition. Drawing {{on the idea of}} Leiden as a 'bastion of liberty', the renowned historian Willem Otterspeer proposes that concepts such as 'equilibrium' and 'mediation' are key to understanding the university as an institution. Modernity and scale expansion have made Leiden University a different institution in the twentyfirst century, one scarcely comparable to what had gone before. As this lively and erudite study shows, a university is a form of social capital, one of Western society's answers to the dilemma of collective action, an instrument for preserving and restoring equilibrium, and hence for fostering continuity. From this vantage point, a university is a confidence-building mechanism that generates solutions to the serious problems facing society today. Also available in Dutch: "[URL] 978 90 8728 024...|$|R

In The Hellenic Religion of the Suffering God (1904), and Dionysus and Early Dionysianism (1921), the poet Vyacheslav Ivanov elaborates the theory of Dionysianism, tracing the origins of literature, and tragedy in particular, to ancient Dionysian mysteries. Károly Kerényi characterizes Dionysus as representative of the psychological life force (Greek Zoê). Other psychological interpretations place Dionysus' emotionality in the foreground, focusing on the joy, terror or hysteria associated with the god. [...] Sigmund Freud specified that his ashes {{should be kept in}} an Ancient Greek vase painted with Dionysian scenes from his collection, which remains on display at Golders Green Crematorium in London.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the re-conceptualization of the intermedial trope of the tableau vivant {{in recent}} East European cinema through several examples from Hungarian and Russian films directed by György Pálfi, Kornél Mundruczó, Benedek Fliegauf, Béla Tarr, and Andrei Zvyagintsev. The tableau vivant in these films is not <b>conceived</b> primarily <b>as</b> an <b>embodiment</b> of a painting, {{the introduction of}} “the real into the image” (as Brigitte Peucker described), instead it appears more like the objectification of bodies as images, and {{something that we can}} associate with what Mario Perniola considers the “sex appeal of the inorganic” or “the Egyptian moment in art. ” As such, the tableau becomes a powerful agent in generating metanarratives, offering a blueprint for a “big picture,” a comprehensive vision of the world (reinforced by recurring mythological themes like the genesis or the end of the world, the loss of Paradise, etc.). We may connect this feature of these tableaux vivants, therefore, to what Lyotard termed as the “figure of return,” and to the reconstructive tendencies of contemporary post-postmodern art...|$|R

40|$|We {{encounter}} the word "kalokagathia" in diû 00;erent contexts and diû 00;erent meanings. The {{aim of this}} text is to present various concepts of the ancient Greek ideal of kalokagathia, which we presently find in academic texts. First, the understanding of kalokagathia {{from the point of}} view of history is described (kalokagathia <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> a historical fact). Then we turn to a conception of the ideal of kalokagathia understood within the context of the education of the whole human being (kalokagathia <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> an educational ideal). However, even though this conception of kalokagathia points towards an ideal, a detailed discussion of it is absent in the educational literature. For a more thorough treatment, we must turn to two further conceptions - first, kalokagathia <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> an ideal of harmony of the body and mind, which deals with the topics of wholeness and harmony of the human being; and second, kalokagathia <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> an ideal of a beautiful and good human being, in which a deeper account is given of what this actually means. Finally, we present the understanding of kalokagathia <b>conceived</b> <b>as</b> a unity of beauty and goodness {{from the point of view}} of ontology...|$|R
