5|$|Education about {{oral hygiene}} for {{long-term}} methamphetamine users is sometimes required. Changes in diet are often necessary for recovering drug users that are receiving dental treatment, {{and the use}} of sugar-free gum may be beneficial. The consumption of water and the avoidance of beverages with a diuretic (dehydrating) effect <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> patients with meth mouth.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes of {{the smooth}} ER <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> detoxify drugs and poisons. Detoxification usually {{involves}} {{the addition of}} a hydroxyl group to a drug, making the drug more soluble and thus easier to purge from the body. One extensively studied detoxification reaction is carried out by the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, which catalyze water-insoluble drugs or metabolites that would otherwise accumulate to toxic levels in cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to prevent the onset of prepatellar bursitis, or prevent the symptoms from worsening, by avoiding trauma to the knee or frequent kneeling. Protective knee pads <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> prevent prepatellar bursitis for those whose professions require frequent kneeling and for athletes who play contact sports, such as American football, basketball, and wrestling.|$|E

5|$|Many {{brachytherapy}} {{procedures are}} performed on an outpatient basis. This convenience {{may be particularly}} relevant for patients who have to work, older patients, or patients who live some distance from treatment centres, {{to ensure that they}} have access to radiotherapy treatment and adhere to treatment plans. Shorter treatment times and outpatient procedures <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> improve the efficiency of radiotherapy clinics.|$|E
5|$|Other imaging methods, such as ultrasonography, {{computed}} tomography (CT), and magnetic imaging (MRI), can aid in diagnosis. Blood tests <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> identify {{the presence of}} infection: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and chlamydial and gonococcal DNA probes.|$|E
5|$|These {{are used}} to cover the {{cylinder}} valve orifice when the cylinder is not in use to prevent dust, water or other materials from contaminating the orifice. They <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> prevent the O-ring of a yoke type valve from falling out. The plug may be vented so that the leakage of gas from the cylinder does not pressurise the plug, {{making it difficult to}} remove.|$|E
50|$|It <b>can</b> <b>also</b> often <b>help</b> to {{distinguish}} his style {{from that of}} other authors, and thus is a vital instrument in disproving for example the theory that Francis Bacon may be the author of Shakespeare's plays, since a statistical comparison between the fields of imagery in both authors shows revealing differences.|$|R
5000|$|The Open Source tool DocBook XSL <b>can</b> <b>also</b> {{generate}} <b>help</b> {{files and}} is an excellent resource for single source publishing.

50|$|CAN {{has been}} {{in support of the}} bill since its inception. In June 2010, during the Legislative Council’s hearing of public {{statements}} for and against the anti-idling bill, the organization secured the appearance of two Hong Kong medical associations, the Hong Kong Society of Pediatrics and the Hong Kong Asthma Society, represented by Dr. Aaron Yu Chak-man and Dr. Alfred Tam Yat-cheung, respectively. Both doctors defended the bill and fielded questions from groups against the anti-idling ordinance. <b>CAN</b> <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> to bring about the unprecedented appearance of students at such events when Talia Stender from Chinese International School, respectively, implored lawmakers to protect their health instead of subordinating society’s interests to narrow constituencies’ demands. <b>CAN</b> <b>also</b> backed the Secretary of the Environment, Edward Yau by accompanying him during his consultation with Hong Kong’s transportation industry workers.|$|R
5|$|Although IFA {{can be used}} {{to confirm}} {{infection}} in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used. In general, a second specimen should be collected more than a month later and retested for persons with indeterminate western blot results. Although much less commonly available, nucleic acid testing (e.g., viral RNA or proviral DNA amplification method) <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> diagnosis in certain situations. In addition, a few tested specimens might provide inconclusive results because of a low quantity specimen. In these situations, a second specimen is collected and tested for HIV infection.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants play an {{important}} role in both the environment and for humans. A single nest is capable of dispersing over 300,000 plant seeds; moreover, meat ants have formed symbiotic relationships with many insects. This ant may be used as a form of pest control to kill the cane toad, an invasive species. They <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> farmers to remove animal carcases by consuming and reducing them to bones in a matter of weeks. Despite this, meat ants are sometimes pests around urban areas and eradicating them is difficult.|$|E
5|$|Some systems use {{parametric}} equalization in {{an attempt}} to correct for room frequency response irregularities. Equalization is often unable to achieve flat frequency response at all listening locations {{in part because of the}} resonance (i.e., standing wave) patterns at low frequencies in nearly all rooms. Careful positioning of the subwoofer within the room <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> flatten the frequency response. Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter general response since they can often be arranged to excite room modes more evenly than a single subwoofer, allowing equalization to be more effective.|$|E

5|$|As in an oratorio, {{the written}} text in a choral symphony {{can be as}} {{important}} as the music, and the chorus and soloists can participate equally with the instruments in the exposition and development of musical ideas. The text <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, {{as in the case of}} Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, as in the case of Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative. Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.|$|E
5|$|In GMAW {{the primary}} cause of {{porosity}} is gas entrapment in the weld pool, which occurs when the metal solidifies before the gas escapes. The gas can come from impurities in the shielding gas or on the workpiece, as well as from an excessively long or violent arc. Generally, the amount of gas entrapped {{is directly related to the}} cooling rate of the weld pool. Because of its higher thermal conductivity, aluminum welds are especially susceptible to greater cooling rates and thus additional porosity. To reduce it, the workpiece and electrode should be clean, the welding speed diminished and the current set high enough to provide sufficient heat input and stable metal transfer but low enough that the arc remains steady. Preheating <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> reduce the cooling rate in some cases by reducing the temperature gradient between the weld area and the base material.|$|E
5|$|Dry land is also {{important}} as it provides opportunities for basking, nesting, and escaping from temperature extremes. Gaping allows evaporation of moisture from the mouth lining and has a cooling effect, and several species make use of shallow burrows on land to keep cool. Wallowing in mud <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> prevent them from overheating. Four species of crocodilians climb trees to bask in areas lacking a shoreline. The type of vegetation bordering the rivers and lakes inhabited by crocodilians is mostly humid tropical forest, with mangrove swamps in estuarine areas. These forests are of great importance to the crocodilians, creating suitable microhabitats where they can flourish. The roots of the trees absorb water when it rains, releasing it back slowly into the environment. When the forests are cleared {{to make way for}} agriculture, rivers tend to silt up, the water runs off rapidly, the water courses can dry up in the dry season and flooding can occur in the wet season. Destruction of forest habitat is probably a greater threat to crocodilians than is hunting.|$|E

[...] Especially if the cancer advances and becomes incurable, treatment of symptoms {{becomes one of}} the main goals of therapy. [...] Palliative care <b>can</b> <b>also</b> entail <b>helping</b> with decision-making such as if or when hospice care is appropriate, and the preferred place for the patient at end of life care.|$|R
5|$|The most {{effective}} methods {{of birth control}} are sterilization by means of vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and implantable birth control. This {{is followed by a}} number of hormone-based methods including oral pills, patches, vaginal rings, and injections. Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms, diaphragms and birth control sponges and fertility awareness methods. The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation. Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all other methods are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them. Safe sex practices, such as with the use of male or female condoms, <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> prevent sexually transmitted infections. Other methods of birth control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex. Some argue not having sex as a form of birth control, but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without birth control education, due to non-compliance.|$|E
