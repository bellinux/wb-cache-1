50|$|<b>Camptodactyly</b> can {{be caused}} by a genetic disorder. In that case, it is an {{autosomal}} dominant trait that is known for its incomplete genetic expressivity. This means that when a person has the genes for it, the condition may appear in both hands, one, or neither. A linkage scan proposed that the chromosomal locus of <b>camptodactyly</b> was 3q11.2-q13.12.|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} a sibship with one {{confirmed}} and three probable {{cases of the}} Marden-Walker syndrome (MWS). Our patient had the major manifestations of blepharophimosis and squint; narrowly arched palate with micrognathia; small mouth and mouth-breathing; facial deformities and distortions; congenital muscle weakness with resulting scoliosis; mild pectus excavatum; <b>camptodactylies</b> and hip and finger joints subluxation. In addition, he had small, apparently low-set and slightly malformed auricles with a unilateral preauricular tag. However, he had no apparent renal or cardiovascular involvement. Results of CPK, EMG, and of histochemical, light microscopic, and ultrastructural studies of muscle biopsy do not suggest a primary myopathy but rather CNS related weakness/hypotonia with small muscle mass and hypoactive DTRs. This pathogenetic hypothesis is confirmed {{by the presence of}} severe mental retardation and minor brain changes suggesting cortical atrophy. In five previously reported cases there has been microcephaly. Phenotype analysis does not convince that the MWS is a true malformation syndrome, but rather hints at the possibility of a congenital metabolic dysplasia. Genetic analysis demonstrates autosomal-recessive inheitance in this and two other instances; primarily sporadic occurrence leaves open the possibility of genetic heterogeneity. PublishedN/...|$|R
50|$|In {{most of its}} cases, <b>camptodactyly</b> occurs sporadically, but it {{has been}} found in several studies that it is {{inherited}} as an autosomal dominant condition.|$|E
50|$|<b>Camptodactyly</b> is {{a medical}} {{condition}} that causes one or more fingers to be permanently bent. It involves fixed flexion deformity of the proximal interphalangeal joints. The fifth finger is always affected.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{consensus}} on what degree of angulation justifies a diagnosis, an incline between 15° and 30° is typical. A similar-sounding term, <b>camptodactyly,</b> is a fixed flexion deformity of a digit.|$|E
50|$|This {{condition}} was first described in 1986. {{and is a}} syndrome of <b>camptodactyly,</b> arthropathy, coxa vara and pericarditis. It may also include congenital cataracts. The cause of this syndrome was discovered in 1999.|$|E
50|$|The {{specific}} {{cause of}} <b>camptodactyly</b> remains unknown, {{but there are}} a few deficiencies that lead to the condition. A deficient lumbrical muscle controlling the flexion of the fingers, and abnormalities of the flexor and extensor tendons.|$|E
50|$|Knuckle pads are {{sometimes}} associated with Dupuytren's contracture and <b>camptodactyly,</b> and histologically, the lesions are fibromas.Knuckle pads are generally non-responsive to treatment, including corticosteroids, {{and tend to}} recur after surgery; however, {{there has been some}} effectiveness with intralesional fluorouracil.|$|E
50|$|Marden-Walker {{syndrome}} (MWS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} congenital disorder. It is characterized by blepharophimosis, microcephaly, micrognathia, multiple joint contractures, arachnodactyly, <b>camptodactyly,</b> kyphoscoliosis, and delayed motor development and {{is often associated with}} cystic dysplastic kidneys, dextrocardia, Dandy-Walker malformation, and agenesis of corpus callosum".|$|E
50|$|Urban-Rogers-Meyer syndrome, {{also known}} as Prader-Willi habitus, osteopenia, and <b>camptodactyly</b> or Urban syndrome, is an {{extremely}} rare inherited congenital disorder first described by Urban et al. (1979). It is characterized by genital anomalies, mental retardation, obesity, contractures of fingers, and osteoporosis, though further complications are known.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pattern of}} {{inheritance}} {{is determined by}} the phenotypic expression of a gene—which is called expressivity. [...] <b>Camptodactyly</b> can be passed on through generations in various levels of phenotypic expression, which include both or only one hand. This means that the genetic expressivity is incomplete. It can be inherited from either parent.|$|E
50|$|Antley-Bixler {{syndrome}} {{presents itself}} at birth or prenatally. Features {{of the disorder}} include brachycephaly (flat forehead), craniosynostosis (complete skull-joint closure) of both coronal and lambdoid sutures, facial hypoplasia (underdevelopment); bowed ulna (forearm bone) and femur (thigh bone), synostosis of the radius (forearm bone), humerus (upper arm bone), and trapezoid (hand bone); <b>camptodactyly</b> (fused interphalangeal joints in the fingers), thin ilial wings (outer pelvic plate), and renal malformations.|$|E
50|$|Meinecke and Fryns (1985) {{reported}} an affected child; consanguinity {{of the parents}} supported recessive inheritance. They noted that a diaphragmatic defect had been described in 4 of the 5 reported cases and lung hypoplasia in all. Young et al. (1986) reported a sixth case. The male infant survived for 12 days. These authors listed corneal clouding, <b>camptodactyly</b> with hypoplastic nails, and abnormalities of the diaphragm as cardinal features.|$|E
50|$|Other {{features}} {{may include}} loose skin, thin deep-set nails, thin hair, short ribs, limited elbow and knee extension, <b>camptodactyly,</b> and a coarse, low-pitched voice. Delayed development of motor {{skills such as}} sitting, standing, and walking are commonly exhibited in early childhood. Patients with Weaver syndrome typically have mild intellectual disability with poor coordination and balance. They also have some neurological abnormalities such as speech delay, epilepsy, intellectual disability, hypotonia or hypertonia, and behavioral problems.|$|E
50|$|Only 21 {{patients}} with 2p15-16.1 microdeletion {{have been described}} as of 2013. The clinical similarities between the individuals resulted in the classification of a new genetic syndrome. The shared clinical features include moderate to severe intellectual disability and similar facial features including telecanthus, drooping eyelids, downslanting, short palpebral fissures, a prominent nasal bridge, high palate with long, smooth philtrum and an everted lower lip. Some of the patients also had feeding problems in infancy, microcephaly, optic nerve hypoplasia and hydronephrosis, wide-spaced nipples, short stature, cortical dysplasia, <b>camptodactyly</b> and pigeon toe.|$|E
50|$|It is {{associated}} with FBN2.It {{is caused by a}} mutation in FBN2 gene on chromosome 5q23. Contractures of varying degrees at birth, mainly involving the large joints, are present in all affected children. Elbows, knees and fingers are most commonly involved. The contractures may be mild and tend to reduce in severity, but residual <b>camptodactyly</b> always remains present. The arm span exceeds body height but the discrepancy may be underestimated due to contractures of elbows and fingers. The same holds for the lower body portion with knee contractures. The most serious complication in CCA is scoliosis and sometimes kyphoscoliosis mandating surgery.|$|E
50|$|People with Liebenberg Syndrome have normal overall body structure. Their {{morphological}} {{differences are}} {{in both of}} their distal humeri, elbows, hands and wrists. The elbows are enlarged with abnormally large olecranons and radial heads. Patients have relatively fixed elbow positions and are therefore unable to pronate or supinate their forearms. Their wrists are also limited in their active movements and have very prominent ulnar sides of the joints. The fingers adopt toe-like structures. Brachydactyly and <b>camptodactyly</b> occur; fingers are short and abnormally bent. These changes in finger shape result in small club shaped appendages. Motion is reduced in all digital joints of the hand.|$|E
50|$|This {{syndrome}} {{is associated with}} microcephaly, arthrogryposis and cleft palate and various craniofacial, respiratory, neurological and limb abnormalities, including bone and joint defects of the upper limbs, adducted thumbs, <b>camptodactyly</b> and talipes equinovarus or calcaneovalgus. It is characterized by craniosynostosis, and myopathy in association with congenital generalized hypertrichosis.Patients with the disease are considered intellectually disabled. Most die in childhood. Patients often suffer from respiratory difficulties such as pneumonia, and from seizures due to dysmyelination in the brain's white matter. It has been hypothesized that the Moro reflex (startle reflex in infants) may be a tool in detecting the congenital clapsed thumb early in infancy. The thumb normally extends {{as a result of}} this reflex.|$|E
50|$|Gordon {{syndrome}} {{is an extremely}} rare disorder that belongs {{to a group of}} genetic disorders known as the distal arthrogryposes. These disorders typically involve stiffness and impaired mobility of certain joints of the lower arms and legs (distal extremities) including the knees, elbows, wrists, and/or ankles. These joints tend to be permanently fixed in a bent or flexed position (contractures). Gordon {{syndrome is}} characterized by the permanent fixation of several fingers in a flexed position (<b>camptodactyly),</b> abnormal bending inward of the foot (clubfoot or talipes), and, less frequently, incomplete closure of the roof of the mouth (cleft palate). In some cases, additional abnormalities may also be present. The range and severity of symptoms may vary from case to case. Gordon syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.|$|E
5000|$|In 1985 Edward Blau, a {{pediatrician}} in Marshfield, Wisconsin, reported {{a family that}} over four generations had granulomatous inflammation of the skin, eyes and joints. The condition was transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. In the same year Jabs et al. reported a family that over two generations had granulomatous synovitis, uveitis and cranial neuropathies. The condition was transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. In 1981 Malleson et al. reported a family that had autosomal dominant synovitis, <b>camptodactyly,</b> and iridocyclitis. One member died of granulomatous arteritis {{of the heart and}} aorta. In 1982 Rotenstein reported a family with granulomatous arteritis, rash, iritis, and arthritis transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait over three generations. Then in 1990 Pastores et al. reported a kindred with a phenotype very similar to what Blau described and suggested that the condition be called Blau Syndrome (BS). They also pointed out the similarities in the families noted above to BS but also pointed out the significant differences in the phenotypes ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Camptodactyly</b> is a digit {{deformity}} {{characterized by}} permanent flexion contracture {{of one or}} both fifth fingers at the proximal interphalangeal joints. Though over 60 distinct types of syndromic <b>camptodactyly</b> have been described, only one disease locus (3 q 11. 2 -q 13. 12) for nonsyndromic <b>camptodactyly</b> has been identified. To identify the genetic defect for <b>camptodactyly</b> in a four-generation Chinese Han family, exome and Sanger sequencings were conducted and a missense variant, c. 1016 C>T (p. S 339 L), in the talin 2 gene (TLN 2) was identified. The variant co-segregated with disease {{in the family and}} was not observed in 12 unaffected family members or 1, 000 normal controls, suggesting that p. S 339 L is a pathogenic mutation. Two asymptomatic carriers in the family indicated incomplete penetrance or more complicated compensated mechanism. Most of p. S 339 L carriers also have relatively benign cardiac phenotypes. Expression of wild and mutant TLN 2 in HEK 293 cells suggested the predominant localization in cytoplasm.

40|$|SUMMARY A second {{family is}} {{described}} in which <b>camptodactyly,</b> club foot, and cleft palate (the Gordon syndrome) is transmitted in a pattern consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance and variable expressivity. Penetrance {{appears to be more}} reduced in females than in males, and cleft palate is the least frequently manifested trait. Since Gordon et al. (1969) first described the syn-drome of <b>camptodactyly,</b> cleft palate, and club foot in a family showing autosomal dominant trans-mission through 3 generations, no further reports have appeared. We wish to report a family in which the Gordon syndrome shows autosomal dominant transmission through 5 generations. Expression ranges from quite severe <b>camptodactyly,</b> club foot, cleft palate, and undescended testes to no mani-festations of the syndrome. So far, the asymptomatic carriers are all females, and the most severely affected members are all males. Received for publication 19 July 1978 Family history The proband (Fig. 1, IV. 29) was a 45 -year-old Caucasian male who consulted us because of a history of cleft palate in his family. He said that his wife, who had recently conceived unexpectedly, was worried about the risk of recurrence of such a deformity. <b>Camptodactyly</b> and club foot were also present in his family, but did not seem to worry them as much. The proband himself had a normal palate, mild <b>camptodactyly</b> of several fingers (Fig. 2 and 3), and moderate talipes equinovarus which had been corrected by home physiotherapy during the 0 i J*...|$|E
40|$|<b>Camptodactyly,</b> the flexion {{contracture}} of {{the proximal}} interphalangeal joint usually involves the small finger and may be a component of some autosomal dominant diseases, such as Marfan's syndrome, cranio-carpo-tarsal dystrophy and oculo-dento-digital dysplasia. <b>Camptodactyly</b> may also coexist with anomalies, such as high arched palate, anomalies of scapula, scoliosis, ptosis, hemi-hypertrophy and taurinuria. Hereditary autonomic and sensory neuropathies (HSAN) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited peripheral neuropathies, which primarily affect the peripheral sensory and autonomic nerves. Patients usually have prominent distal sensory loss with complaints of insensitivity to pain. Prominent distal sensory loss may cause chronic ulcerations in the feet and hands, and less frequently, severe complications as extensive soft tissue infections, osteomyelitis and amputations.

40|$|<b>Camptodactyly</b> is a {{permanent}} flexion deformity at the interphalangeal joints, usually at the proximal, interphalangeal joints.
