40|$|A {{number of}} matters {{relating}} to commercial leases {{have recently been}} before the courts in Singapore. They explore: the long-running question of {{the boundary between the}} non-derogation from grant covenant and the <b>covenant</b> <b>for</b> <b>quiet</b> enjoyment; the evidentiary rules relating to leases by estoppel; and the ambit of the landlord’s remedy – long abolished in many common law jurisdictions – of distress...|$|R

60|$|And this {{compromise}} {{would not}} have been made from any prudential motive of saving what would yet remain, for Mr Harding still felt little doubt but he should be left <b>for</b> life in <b>quiet</b> <b>possession</b> of the good things he had, if he chose to retain them. No; he would have done so from the sheer love of quiet, and from a horror of being made the subject of public talk. He had very often been moved to pity.--to that inward weeping of the heart for others' woes; but none had he ever pitied more than that old lord, whose almost fabulous wealth, drawn from his church preferments, had become the subject of so much opprobrium, of such public scorn; that wretched clerical octogenarian Croesus, whom men would not allow to die in peace,--whom all the world united to decry and to abhor.|$|R

2500|$|According to {{historian}} John Mack Faragher, {{the religious}} and ethnic dimensions of the Expulsion of Acadians are in addition to, and deeply connected to, the military exigencies cited as causes for the Removals. There is significant evidence in the correspondence of military and civil leaders for Anti-Catholicism. Faragher writes, [...] "The first session of the Nova Scotia Assembly ... passed a series of laws intended to institutionalize Acadian dispossession" [...] including an act titled [...] "An Act <b>for</b> the <b>Quieting</b> of <b>Possessions</b> to Protestant Grantees of land formerly occupied by the French." [...] In it and two subsequent acts the Church of England was made the official religion. These acts granted certain political rights to Protestants while the new laws excluded Catholics from public office and voting and forbade Catholics from owning land in the province. It also empowered British authorities to seize all [...] "popish" [...] property (Church lands) for the crown and barred Catholic clergy from entering or residing in the province, as they wanted no repeat of Le Loutre and his type of war. In addition to other anti-Catholic measures, Faragher concludes [...] "These laws—passed by a popular assembly, not enacted by military fiat—laid {{the foundation for the}} migration of Protestant settlers." ...|$|R

40|$|Conservation {{covenants}} {{have the}} potential to be powerful tools for protecting both ecological values and timber harvesting opportunities on lands dedicated <b>for</b> forestry purposes. <b>Covenants</b> <b>for</b> conservation forestry are among the most complex form of conservation covenants and must be carefully tailored to reflect ecological conditions and conservation objectives. In this report I evaluate the design of a <b>covenant</b> <b>for</b> conservation forestry on Cortes Island, British Columbia. I assess both structural and ecological provisions of the covenant to determine whether covenants were a useful tool for conservation forestry in this case. Effective <b>covenants</b> <b>for</b> conservation forestry must include clear objectives, balance flexibility with rigour, adopt provisions to maximize compliance and include a monitoring program. In addition to regulating forest practices, <b>covenants</b> <b>for</b> conservation forestry should protect habitat at multiple scales, designate reserves, maintain structural complexity and ensure connectivity across the landscape. Careful consideration must also be given to how <b>covenants</b> <b>for</b> conservation forestry will incorporate societal values...|$|R

At 4 a.m. Nisus and Phoebe weighed and steered for Taggal, a port about 20 or 25 leagues {{further to the}} east. The next day Phoebe arrived off the harbour. Together with a landing party of seamen, marines, and some sepoys, Captain Hillyar took <b>quiet</b> <b>possession</b> of the fort and public stores.|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims at defining, both {{legally and}} normatively, {{the nature and}} scope of consumers' rights to {{commercial}} copies of copyright works as an essential means to preserve the coherence and legitimacy of copyright. It explores the interaction between: (1) technological developments, which empower consumers to experience copyright works in unprecedented ways, but also augment copyright holders' control over access to and use of their works; (2) the progressive expansion in scope of copyright holders' exclusive rights as conferred by copyright law; and (3) the contract terms and technological protection measures under which copyright works are made available to consumers. The nature and scope of consumers' rights to commercial copies of copyright works are defined by applying property law and theory, in particular, through {{an analysis of the}} concepts of ownership, property limitations and the numerus clausus principle. The nature and scope of consumers' rights to commercial copies of copyright works are also analyzed through the application of consumer protection law and theory. The thesis explores the use of consumer law concepts such as implied obligations of quality, fitness <b>for</b> purpose, title, <b>quiet</b> <b>possession,</b> information disclosure requirements and prohibitions of unfair practices to assert claims against restrictions on uses of commercial copies of copyright works. Commercial copies of copyright works emerge as a peculiar form of personal property, the rights in which are determined to a large extent by the exceptions to copyright infringement laid out in Canada's Copyright Act or similar statutes in other jurisdictions, and by the commercial transactions through which consumers access copyright works. Consumers' ownership rights to commercial copies of copyright works are progressively eroding. The thesis provides various recommendations to clarify and strengthen consumers' rights to commercial copies of copyright works {{on the basis of the}} prima facie normative force of ownership freedoms and the instrumental justifications of copyright to incent the creation and the dissemination of copyright works...|$|R
