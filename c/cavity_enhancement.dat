From January 2010 to April 2014, among 190 patients with histopathologically confirmed glioblastoma, a total of 33 patients with non-measurable wall enhancement on post-CCRT MR imaging were enrolled and divided into two subgroups: non-progression (n = 18) and progression groups (n = 15). We analyzed the wall enhancement patterns, which were categorized into three patterns: thin, thick and nodular enhancement. ADC values were measured in the enhancing portions of the walls. The progression-free survival (PFS) related to the wall enhancement was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Statistically {{significant differences in the}} surgical <b>cavity</b> wall <b>enhancement</b> patterns was shown between the progression and non-progression groups (P = 0. 0032).

The single exciton qubit system is controlled by ultrafast optical pulses. Then, the resonance fluorescence (RF), which {{is proportional to the}} population of the quantum dot, is measured by a spectrometer. The two main results of the whole thesis are: i) measurement of the short exciton lifetime (22. 7 ~ps); ii) achievement of full populated quantum dot through a few photons (on average approx. 2. 5 photons). To measure such a short lifetime the Two Pulse Resonance Fluorescence technique was developed. This technique enables measurements with high time resolution. This required the development of the Differential Resonance Fluorescence technique. This technique is highly efficient in suppressing the laser scattered light, permitting measurements of the RF of the dot.
