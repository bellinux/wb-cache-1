The modification of the ship's propulsion system also proved to be a mistake, as the ship's speed was too low, and it hindered her maneuverability.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of microwave balloon angioplasty in sealing arterial dissections and to characterize the histologic features associated with this intervention. Background. Coronary dissection accompanying balloon dilation is frequently associated with abrupt closure and acute ischemic complications. Effective management of this complication remains an active area of investigation. Because thermal energy is effective in welding separated atherosclerotic plaques, a microwave-based catheter system that provides controlled local heating was utilized in vessels with angioplasty-induced dissections. Methods. Iliac artery dissections were induced in a hypercholesterolemic rabbit model. Vessels were randomly assigned to treatment with standard balloon angioplasty (<b>control</b> <b>vessels)</b> or microwave balloon angioplasty using an average temperature of 80 °C. The response of the artery was assessed angiographically and histologically. Results. Angiographic success, defined as a reduction of dissection length by > 50 % or the resolution of lumen haziness, was achieved is 63 % of microwave-treated vessels and in 16 % of <b>control</b> <b>vessels</b> (p < 0. 005). Dissection length (mean ± SD) was reduced 8. 0 ± 4. 8 mm in microwave-treated vessels compared with 0. 1 ± 7. 9 mm in vessels receiving standard balloon inflations (p < 0. 005). Cellular necrosis was more commonly observed in microwave-treated <b>vessels</b> than in <b>control</b> <b>vessels</b> (73 % vs. 17 %, p < 0. 05), but less intraluminal thrombus was seen in vessels exposed to Microwave energy (p < 0. 05). Conclusions. Microwave balloon angioplasty is more effective than routine balloon inflations in sealing arterial dissections in this model and appears to be less thrombogenic in these markedly disrupted vessels...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} angiogenesis, {{defined by the}} {{development}} of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, is essential in tissue remodeling and regeneration. This complex process involves extensive interplay between cells, soluble factors and extra-cellular matrix (ECM) components. Insufficient angiogenesis, implicated in many disease processes such as heart failure and stroke, results in inadequate nutrient and oxygen delivery. Thus, therapeutic strategies to promote revascularization have been extensively investigated. Although several angiogenic growth factors have been identified and delivery investigated to induce revascularization, no clinical product exists to date to promote revascularization. This thesis investigates the delivery of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) from bioengineered matrices to promote revascularization in the brain. Two approaches will be described, non-viral gene delivery and protein delivery, both from matrix metalloproteinase degradable hyaluronic acid based hydrogels. Non-viral gene delivery has the potential to overcome limitations with protein degradation and inactivation by delivering plasmid DNA (more chemically stable then proteins). Non-viral gene delivery to cells seeded within hyaluronic acid matrices was investigated to begin to understand the process of gene transfer within hydrogel matrices. However, due to the low protein expression achieved, protein delivery was investigated. To directly deliver VEGF from our hydrogel biomaterials we first investigated how the presentation of VEGF affected endothelial cell activation. We showed that through controlling the discrete distribution of VEGF and integrin co-ligands in engineered matrices, ECs phenotype can be modulated to favor the tip cell phenotype when VEGF is bound and clustered, leading to <b>controlled</b> <b>vessel</b> branching. In addition, we found that <b>controlled</b> <b>vessel</b> branching leads to enhanced blood vessels with pericyte coverage after stroke. Further studies should be done to further improve the efficiency of our delivery strategy and their effect on tissue regeneration through a <b>controlled</b> <b>vessel</b> formation...|$|R
