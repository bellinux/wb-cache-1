Now against this <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> Meg had peculiar prejudices; because, there being no shops in the old village of Saint Ronan's, the said commercial emissaries, for the convenience of their traffic, always took up their abode at the New Inn, or Hotel, in the rising and rival village called Saint Ronan's Well, unless when some straggler, by chance or dire necessity, was compelled to lodge himself at the Auld Town, as the place of Meg's residence began to be generally termed. She had, therefore, no sooner formed the hasty conclusion, that the individual in question belonged to this obnoxious class, than she resumed her former occupation, and continued to soliloquize and apostrophize her absent handmaidens, without even appearing sensible of his presence.|$|E
60|$|By this time, {{it being}} past eleven o'clock, the two bar-keepers of the saloon were in pretty {{constant}} activity. One {{of these young}} men had a rare faculty in the concoction of gin-cocktails. It was a spectacle to behold, how, with a tumbler in each hand, he tossed the contents {{from one to the}} other. Never conveying it awry, nor spilling the least drop, he compelled the frothy liquor, as it seemed to me, to spout forth from one glass and descend into the other, in a great parabolic curve, as well-defined and calculable as a planet's orbit. He had a good forehead, with a particularly large development just above the eyebrows; fine intellectual gifts, no doubt, which he had educated to this profitable end; being famous for nothing but gin-cocktails, and commanding a fair salary by his one accomplishment. These cocktails, and other artificial combinations of liquor, (of which there were at least a score, though mostly, I suspect, fantastic in their differences,) were much in favor with the younger <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers,</b> who, at farthest, had only reached the second stage of potatory life. The staunch, old soakers, on the other hand men who, if put on tap, would have yielded a red alcoholic liquor, by way of blood usually confined themselves to plain brandy-and-water, gin, or West India rum; and, oftentimes, they prefaced their dram with some medicinal remark as to the wholesomeness and stomachic qualities of that particular drink. Two or three appeared to have bottles of their own behind the counter; and, winking one red eye to the bar-keeper, he forthwith produced these choicest and peculiar cordials, which {{it was a matter of}} great interest and favor, among their acquaintances, to obtain a sip of.|$|E

His face was a talisman to the porters and servants of his more dashing clients, and procured him ready admission, though he trudged on foot, and others, who were denied, rattled to the door in carriages. Here he was all softness and cringing civility; his step so light, that it scarcely produced a sound upon the thick carpets; his voice so soft that it was not audible beyond the person to whom it was addressed. But in the poorer habitations Ralph was another man; his boots creaked upon the passage floor as he walked boldly in; his voice was harsh and loud as he demanded the money that was overdue; his threats were coarse and angry. With another <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers,</b> Ralph was again another man. These were attorneys of more than doubtful reputation, who helped him to new business, or raised fresh profits upon old. With them Ralph was familiar and jocose, humorous upon the topics of the day, and especially pleasant upon bankruptcies and pecuniary difficulties that made good for trade. In short, it would have been difficult to have recognised the same man under these various aspects, but for the bulky leather case full of bills and notes which he drew from his pocket at every house, and the constant repetition of the same complaint, (varied only in tone and style of delivery,) that the world thought him rich, and that perhaps he might be if he had his own; but there was no getting money in when it was once out, either principal or interest, and it was a hard matter to live; even to live from day to day.|$|E

40|$|International audienceCritical {{resources}} are often shared among different classes of customers. Capacity reservation allows each <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> to better manage priorities {{of its customers}} but might lead to unused capacity. Unused capacity can be avoided or reduced by advance cancelation. This paper addresses the service capacity reservation for a given <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers.</b> The reservation process is characterized by: contracted time slots (CTS) reserved for the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers,</b> requests for lengthy regular time slots (RTS) and two advance cancelation modes to cancel CTS one-period or two-period before. The optimal control under a given contract is formulated as an average cost Markov Decision Process (MDP) {{in order to minimize}} customer waiting times, unused CTS and CTS cancelation. Structural properties of optimal control policies are established via the corresponding discounted cost MDP problem.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} three delay systems where {{different}} <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> impatient <b>customers</b> arrive according to independent Poisson processes. In the first system, a single server receives two <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> with general service time requirements, and follows a non-preemptive priority policy in serving them. Both <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> abandon the system when their exponentially distributed patience limits expire. The second system comprises parallel and identical servers providing {{the same type}} of service for both <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> impatient <b>customers</b> under the non-preemptive priority policy. We assume exponential service times and consider two cases depending on the time-to-abandon distribution being exponentially distributed or deterministic. In either case, we permit different reneging rates or patience limits for each class. Finally, we consider the first-come-first-served policy in single- and multi-server settings. In all models, we obtain the Laplace transform of the virtual waiting time for each class by exploiting the level-crossing method. This enables us to compute the steady-state system performance measures...|$|R

30|$|The {{load demand}} {{of the system}} is a major source of {{uncertainty}} in power system planning [22], and is originated owing to the diversity of load demand among different <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers.</b> In practical situations, loads are mixtures of different load types, depending {{on the nature of the}} area being supplied, therefore, a load class mix of residential, industrial, and commercial loads is to be investigated too, in which every bus of the system has a different type of load connected to it [9]. Usually, distribution system planners provide dedicated feeders to its different <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers,</b> each of whom has its own characteristic load pattern which varies hourly and seasonally. A more realistic modeling should be devised by considering the daily and seasonal variations in the aggregate load patterns of different <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers.</b> Therefore, the modeling of annual load profile should be made more realistic by considering customer-wise dedicated feeders and their characteristic load patterns while dealing with resource allocation problems of distribution systems.|$|E

Distribution system planners usually provide dedicated feeders for each <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers.</b> In this paper, distribution feeders {{are assumed to be}} divided into residential, industrial and commercial categories.

Several intelligent networks are nowa-days adopting this method of access since it allows them to control the cost of communication.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{an extension of}} the standard newsvendor problem by allowing for multiple <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers.</b> The product is first sold to customers with the highest priority, and the remaining units (if any) are sold at a discounted price to customers in decreasing order of priority until all <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> have been served, limited only by the available stock. Unsold items, if any, have a salvage value. The demands <b>of</b> different priority <b>customers</b> are independent random va-riables with known probability distributions. The problem is to find the purchase quantity that maximizes the expected profit. We show that this problem actually reduces to the standard news-vendor problem with the demand distribution being a mixture of the input demand distributions. Since this mixture of distributions is typically hard to handle analytically, we propose a simple general heuristic which can be implemented using different types of distributions. Some of these implementations produce near optimal solutions. We tested these implementations for the case <b>of</b> two demand <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> and found that they outperform previously published heuristics in almost all instances.

40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} Revenue {{management}} has been vastly used in different modes of passenger and freight transport industry, especially airlines, {{as a tool for}} revenue maximization and allocation of service capacity to different groups <b>of</b> <b>customers.</b> However, traditional revenue management models are not sufficient to study interactions such as competition or cooperation within the market among transport service providers. The aim {{of this paper}} is to construct a framework for the analysis of the cooperations between agents of transport/logistics service providers, each of which dealing with different <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers.</b> Design/methodology/approach This paper studies a static capacity allocation problem in revenue management through two cooperative games where the players are agents who sell the same transport/logistics service to different <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> <b>of</b> different profitability. It analyzes characteristics of those games through six propositions. Findings This research shows that agents will not cooperate voluntarily only by the incentive of revenue. The results also suggest a fair method to share revenue among agents in the case they are owned by the same company or any other case where they have no choice but cooperation. However, the paper shows that the total revenue gained from the coalition of all agents can be shared fairly among them. Research limitations/implications (if applicable) Further study of the cases where demand probability distributions change under coalitions is recommended. Combining pricing and capacity allocation decisions and studying other resource sharing rules in bankruptcy games and their applicability in practice are also desirable fields of generalization. Practical implications (if applicable) The results can be applied to cases of mergers, acquisition and coalition of transport/logistic service providers. Furthermore, the results can be employed to find negotiable and fair ways of sharing extra revenue generated by cooperation. What is original/value of paper Former game theory models of revenue management either were non-cooperative or in the case they were cooperative, they studied cooperations between firms who deal with a range <b>of</b> <b>classes.</b> However, this paper defines players as the agents who are in charge <b>of</b> <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> or in other words, the <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> themselves...|$|R
