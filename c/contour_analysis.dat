50|$|Endothelial {{dysfunction}} {{results in}} reduced compliance (increased arterial stiffness), {{especially in the}} smaller arteries. This is characteristic of patients with hypertension. However, it {{may be seen in}} normotensive patients (with normal blood pressure) before the appearance of clinical hypertension. Reduced arterial compliance is also seen in patients with diabetes and also in smokers. It is actually a part of a vicious cycle that further elevates blood pressure, aggravates atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), and leads to increased cardiovascular risk. Arterial compliance can be measured by several techniques. Most of them are invasive and are not clinically appropriate. Pulse <b>contour</b> <b>analysis</b> is a non-invasive method that allows easy measurement of arterial elasticity to identify patients at risk for cardiovascular events.|$|E

In this paper, we present an approach for Reeb graph extraction using a novel mapping function.

We perform discrete contour for each vertex according to our mapping function. Topology changes can be detected by discrete <b>contours</b> <b>analysis</b> to construct the Reeb graph. Our mapping function has some important properties. It is invariant to rigid and non rigid transformations, it is insensitive to noise, it is robust to small topology changes, and it does not depend on parameters. From the extracted graph, these properties show the significant parts of a 3 D-model. We retain the evaluation criteria to the properties of the mapping function, and compared them to those used in the state of the art. In the end, we present extracted Reeb graph on various models with different positions...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{validate}} a {{new device}} (PiCCO system; Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany), we compared cardiac index derived from transpulmonary thermodilution and from pulse <b>contour</b> <b>analysis</b> in pediatric patients after surgery for congenital heart disease. We performed a prospective clinical study in a pediatric cardiac {{intensive care unit}} of a university hospital. MethodsTwenty-four patients who had had cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease (median age 4. 2 years, range 1. 4 - 15. 2 years) were investigated in the first 24 hours after admission to the intensive care unit. A 3 F thermodilution catheter was inserted in the femoral artery. Intracardiac shunts were excluded by echocardiography intraoperatively or postoperatively. Cardiac index derived from pulse <b>contour</b> <b>analysis</b> was documented in each patient 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours after admission to the intensive care unit. Subsequently, a set of three measurements of thermodilution cardiac indices derived by injections into a central venous line was performed and calculated by the PiCCO system. ResultsThe mean bias between cardiac indices derived by thermodilution and those derived by pulse <b>contour</b> <b>analysis</b> over all data points was 0. 05 (SD 0. 4) L · min · m− 2 (95 % confidence interval 0. 01 - 0. 10).

40|$|Background and objective: During off-pump {{coronary}} bypass grafting, surgical manipulation and dislocation {{of the heart}} may cause cardiovascular instability. Monitoring of cardiac output facilitates intraoperative haemodynamic management but pulmonary artery catheters are often considered too invasive. Pulse <b>contour</b> <b>analysis</b> and transoesophageal echocardiography could serve as alternatives, but there is controversy about their accuracies. We validated pulse <b>contour</b> <b>analysis</b> using a standard radial arterial catheter (PulseCO(TM)) and aortic Doppler flowmetry with transoesophageal echocardiography in patients undergoing off-pump {{coronary bypass}} surgery. Pulmonary arterial thermodilution served as the reference technique. Methods: In 20 patients undergoing off-pump coronary bypass, cardiac output was measured with bolus thermodilution (COTD), pulse <b>contour</b> <b>analysis</b> (COPC), and transoesophageal echocardiography (COecho) at fixed time intervals during the procedure. Data were compared using linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. At {{the end of the}} procedure, dobutamine was infused at a rate of 2. 5 mu g kg(- 1) min(- 1) in six patients to study the agreement between methods in quantifying changes in cardiac output. Results: Comparison between COPC and COTD showed a bias +/- limits of agreement of - 0. 03 +/- 1. 30 Lmin(- 1) (mean error 29 %). Doppler echocardiography was not always feasible when the heart was displaced from the oesophagus and had lower accuracy: bias +/- limits of agreement vs. COTD was 0. 45 +/- 1. 93 (mean error 43 %. Increases in cardiac output induced by dobutamine were well quantified both by pulse <b>contour</b> <b>analysis</b> (COPC = 0. 76 X COTD + 0. 58; r(2) = 0. 65) and Doppler although the latter tended to overestimate these changes (COecho = 1. 5 8 X COTD - 0. 13; r(2) = 0. 53). Conclusions: Calibrated pulse <b>contour</b> <b>analysis</b> using the PulseCO system is an acceptable technique to measure cardiac output non-invasively in off-pump coronary bypass patients. Doppler echocardiography performs less well and is not always feasible with transoesophageal echocardiography when the heart is displaced...|$|E
