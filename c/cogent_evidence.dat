40|$|This article canvasses {{recent case}} law adjudicating the uneasy {{disclosure}} {{balance between the}} interests of the insurer and the insured in the process of transacting an insurance contract. It examines also the consequences of non-disclosure and misrepresentation and whether the avowed legislative intent — that the liability of the insurer in respect of a claim is to be reduced to the amount that would place the insurer in the position it would have been had the non-disclosure or misrepresentation not occurred — is being achieved in practice. As there is no doubt as to who bears the onus of proof as to non-disclosure or misrepresentation it is surprising that insurers continue to flounder in this regard in relation to underwriting guidelines and adherence to them. The article reviews recent case law in this context and stresses that an insurer wishing to preserve its capacity to avoid liability on the basis that it would not have entered into a contract at all had the true situation been known to it must maintain detailed underwriting guidelines supported by consistent adherence to those guidelines. Recent case law also emphasises that the insurer must provide clear and <b>cogent</b> admissible <b>evidence</b> from appropriate personnel and officers of the company to discharge its onus...|$|R

First, it argues that to fulfil the constitutional expectations {{brought about by the}} HRA, a minimum rigour of proportionality review should be observed. This baseline consists of requiring the government to demonstrate to the courts by means of <b>cogent</b> and sufficient <b>evidence</b> that a rights-limiting measure satisfies the distinct stages of the proportionality test.

40|$|La Chronica latina regum Castellae se escribió en, al menos, tres etapas entre 1223 y 1237, según demuestra el análisis contrastivo de las noticias datadas, la estructura y los sistemas cronológicos empleados en el texto. Esta composición por etapas explica la existencia de diferencias léxicas, de estilo y de fuentes entre las diversas secciones, así como los cambios en el tratamiento dado a ciertos personajes. Pese a estas divergencias, la unidad ideológica del texto y la persistencia de ciertos procedimientos compositivos, como el recurso al calendario litúrgico o a las citas bíblicas, aseguran la existencia de un único autor. Este no pudo ser otro que Juan de Soria, canciller de Fernando III, tal como descubre el sorprendente paralelismo entre los eventos conmemorados en los diplomas y los hechos resaltados en la Chronica.

We report the role of CdS as an efficient cell tag with fluorescence on par with previously documented cadmium telluride and cadmium selenide QDs, which have been considered to impart high levels of toxicity. In this study, the toxicity of bare QDs was efficiently quenched by encapsulating them in a biocompatible coat of silica. The toxicity profile and uptake of bare CdS QDs and silica-coated QDs, along with the CD 31 -labeled, silica-coated CdS QDs on human umbilical vein endothelial cells and glioma cells, were investigated. The effect of size, along with the time-dependent cellular uptake of the nanomaterials, has also been emphasized. Enhanced, high-specificity imaging toward endothelial cell lines in comparison with glioma cells was achieved with CD 31 antibody-conjugated nanoparticles. The silica-coated nanomaterials exhibited excellent biocompatibility and greater photostability inside live cells, in addition to possessing an extended shelf life. In vivo biocompatibility and localization study of silica-coated CdS QDs in medaka fish embryos, following direct nanoparticle exposure for 24 hours, authenticated the nanomaterials&# 39; high potential for in vivo imaging, augmented with superior biocompatibility. As expected, CdS QD-treated embryos showed 100 % mortality, whereas the silica-coated QD-treated embryos stayed viable and healthy throughout and after the experiments, devoid of any deformities.
