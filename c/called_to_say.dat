500|$|Poitier and Wilder became friends, {{with the}} pair working {{together}} on a script called Traces—which became 1982's Hanky Panky, the film where Wilder met comedian Gilda Radner. Through {{the remainder of the}} decade, Wilder and Radner worked on several projects together. After Hanky Panky, Wilder directed his third film, 1984's The Woman in Red, which starred Wilder, Radner, and Kelly Le Brock. The Woman in Red was not well received by the critics, nor was their next project, 1986's Haunted Honeymoon, which failed to attract audiences. The Woman in Red did win an Academy Award for Best Original Song for Stevie Wonder's song [...] "I Just <b>Called</b> <b>to</b> <b>Say</b> I Love You".|$|E

[...] When asked years later how he got to Michigan, Schulz recalled that, in the summer of 1904, he was working in the mill and had received several offers to play football. [...] One day, his father <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Fielding Yost of Michigan was in his office.

[...] You are to play football for him at Michigan. [...] We have made all the arrangements".|$|E
500|$|Before {{reaching}} Cyrus, {{the song}} had {{been rejected by}} several country artists. It was eventually picked up by Peter Chelsom, director of Hannah Montana: The Movie, who gave it to Cyrus to record for the film. Chelsom found what would become [...] "The Climb" [...] while visiting Nashville, Tennessee, during a quest to find eleven new songs for Hannah Montana: The Movie. After hearing Alexander's music, Chelsom asked her to submit songs for consideration. Alexander recorded [...] "It's the Climb" [...] on a CD {{and gave it to}} him. Several weeks later, Chelsom <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that [...] "the song was gonna {{be an integral part of}} the movie". However, he wanted Mabe and Alexander to rework some of the song's content and to change the song from third person to first person. Alexander felt the changes amounted to a [...] "substantial amount of the song" [...] and commented, [...] "For me, when you change something from third person to first person, it can change the whole meaning of a line." [...] She and Mabe [...] "wrestl over taking words out" [...] and how much they could change while maintaining the song's integrity. After a number of drafts, Mabe and Alexander finally created a version they felt was [...] "perfect for the movie".|$|E

500|$|The cast of Blue Velvet {{included}} several then-relatively unknown actors. Isabella Rossellini had gained some exposure before the film for her Lancôme {{ads in the}} early 1980s and for being the daughter of actress Ingrid Bergman and Italian film director Roberto Rossellini. After completion of the film, during test screenings, ICM Partners—the agency representing Rossellini—immediately dropped her as a client. Furthermore, the nuns at the school in Rome that Rossellini attended in her youth <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> they were praying for her. Dennis Hopper was the biggest [...] "name" [...] in the film, having starred in Easy Rider (1969), while Kyle MacLachlan had played the central role in Lynch's critical and commercial failure Dune (1984), a science fiction epic {{based on the novel}} of the same name. MacLachlan later became a recurring collaborator with Lynch, who remarked: [...] "Kyle plays innocents who are interested in the mysteries of life. He's the person you trust enough to go into a strange world with." [...] Dennis Hopper—said to be Lynch's third choice—accepted the role, reportedly having exclaimed, [...] "I've got to play Frank! I am Frank!" [...] as Hopper confirmed in the Blue Velvet [...] "making-of" [...] documentary The Mysteries of Love, produced for the 2002 special edition. For the role of Dorothy Vallens, Lynch met Isabella Rossellini at a restaurant, and she accepted the role. Laura Dern, then just 19 years old, was cast after various successful actresses at the time turned it down, including Molly Ringwald.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Schuur {{appeared}} as a guest performer on Sesame Street. In an interview by Elmo, she answered questions about how a blind person can learn to use other senses to get along in the world. In 1998, she was a special guest on [...] "Ray Charles in Concert", {{a benefit for the}} Miami Lighthouse for the Blind. [...] She performed at Carnegie Hall in a tribute to Irving Berlin in 1988, and again in 1996 in a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald. Schuur gave a performance in 1999 to honor Stevie Wonder at The Kennedy Center Honors. She sang [...] "I Just <b>Called</b> <b>to</b> <b>Say</b> I Love You" [...] arranged and accompanied by Herbie Hancock. Entertainment writer Jake Elyachar rated this {{as one of the top}} 20 best performances ever given on the Kennedy Honors series. Wonder was visibly emotionally moved by the performance. She was awarded the Helen Keller Achievement Award by the American Foundation for the Blind in 2000. Late in 2003, Schuur released Midnight, featuring original songs written by Barry Manilow for the album. Manilow's long-time songwriting team, which included co-producer Eddie Arkin, and lyricists Marty Panzer, Bruce Susan, and Adrienne Anderson, contributed to the project. Manilow produced the album and also performed on it. The guest artists were Brian McKnight and Karrin Allyson and it was backed by Tony-winner Bill Elliott and the Bill Elliott Swing Orchestra.
