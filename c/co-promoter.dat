40|$|The {{ferromagnetic}} {{phase in}} pure neutron matter {{as well as}} charge neutral, beta-equilibrated nuclear matter is considered. We employ Quantum Hadrodynamics, a relativistic field theory description of nuclear matter with meson degrees of freedom, and include couplings between the baryon (proton and neutron) magnetic dipole moment {{as well as between}} their charge and the magnetic field in the Lagrangian density describing such a system. We vary the strength of the baryon magnetic dipole moment till a non-zero value of the magnetic field, for which the total energy density of the magnetised system is at a minimum, is found. The system is then assumed to be in the ferromagnetic state. The ferromagnetic equation of state is employed to study matter in the neutron star interior. We find that as the density increases the ferromagnetic field does not increase continuously, but exhibit sudden rapid increases. These sudden increases in the magnetic field correspond to shifts between different configurations of the charged particle's Landau levels and can have significant observational consequences for neutron stars. We also found that although the ferromagnetic phase softens the neutron star equation of state it does not significantly alter the star's mass-radius relationship. The properties of magnetised symmetric nuclear matter were also studied. We confirm that magnetised matter tends to be more proton-rich but become more weakly bound for stronger magnetic fields. We show that the behaviour of the compressibility of nuclear matter is influenced by the Landau quantisation and tends to have an oscillatory character as it increases with the magnetic field. The symmetry energy also exhibits similar behaviour. Comment: Ph. D. thesis, promoter F. G. Scholtz and <b>co-promoters</b> H. B. Geyer and G. C.

(Supervisorby LexieLumingkewas as the promoter,Rifdan and AndiImaKesuma as the <b>co-promoters)</b> This {{research}} was aimed to describe, analyze, {{and interpret the}} woman leadership style in making decision, the determinant of regent decision making, and public opinion toward the quality of decision making process of regent in South East Minahasa. The design of this {{research was}} qualitative using case study approach. The data was gathered by observation, intensive interview, and documentation. The data analyzing technic was Miles Huberman interactive mode. The result of this research showed that the woman leadership style in making decision was authoritative. The process of telling, selling, participating, and delegating had not been done totally yet, the tendency of using feeling, rigid and had the limitation in communication;The control of delegation was very weak; The determinants of head region decision making were the aspects of moral value order, personality, tendency to take risk, and the potential of inexpediency. The potential of inexpediency occurred when the regent did not think too much on the effect of society rejection caused by the lack of paying attention to those four aspects which caused the unreasonable decision making, not procedural and endeavor to prevent the mal-administration and it’s result on the infraction of law. The public opinion toward the quality of regent decision making process in South East Minahasa showed that the activity stage of intelligence, designing, and choosing had not been performed yet; moreover, the society involvement had not been done well, society aspiration was still ignored. The regenthowever was inexpert enough about the regulation, and her main duty and function, consequently designing the policy without procedure; tendency to assail management, choosing the inconstitutional that had the impact on the infraction of the law and ended with the mall administration. As the solution for the leadership problem in making decision, it is suggested that: a leader should not be persuaded easily; the decision making should be based on the procedure and the current certain regulation; comprehending the regulation and her main duty and function; before making a decision it is important to identify and choose the alternative; track record should fit the competence in government field; the management decision needs to be under the protection of law; decision making should be based on the rationality; and do not involve the religious affair in the government affair.
