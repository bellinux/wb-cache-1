40|$|We provide initial {{evidence}} on the economic consequences of a relatively large, fully disclosed, and apparently purposeful reporting decision: the balance sheet classification of short-term obligations as long-term <b>debt</b> <b>in</b> accordance with "Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 6 ". We examine a sample of 1, 684 American firm-year observations between the years 1989 and 2000 to determine whether reclassification is associated with debt-ratings and equity values. We find that reclassification {{increases the likelihood of}} a subsequent debt-rating downgrade. We also find that market value decreases with increases in the amount reclassified, and that equity value is higher after firms cease reclassifying short-term obligations as long-term debt, compared with other firm-years in the sample. Thus, <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>debt</b> classification are empirically linked in predictable directions to subsequent <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>debt</b> ratings and stock values.

This study finds that in general, the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>debt</b> level is negatively affected by the probability of bankruptcy and size.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of EMU’s fiscal indicators {{has been questioned}} by recent episodes of large upward deficit revisions. This paper discusses the causes of such revisions {{in order to identify}} ways to improve monitoring. The computation of EMU’s deficit indicator involves the assessment of accrued revenue and expenditure and the identification of transactions in financial assets. Both can open margins for opportunistic accounting. However, crosschecks between deficit and changes in gross nominal debt (the other fiscal indicator used in EMU) can reduce the scope for fiscal gimmickry. Simple comparison of deficit and changes in debt can readily spotlight large inconsistencies in fiscal data. Nevertheless, consistency checks must go deeper than simple comparison, since different items in the reconciliation account between deficit and <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>debt</b> can offset each other. Econometric evidence suggests that such offset may indeed have been used to reduce the visibility of deficit-specific fiscal gimmickry. Attention to the quality of statistics has increased in recent years, also {{in the context of the}} reform of the Stability and Growth Pact. In this context, the paper argues that detailed analysis of the reconciliation account between deficit and <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>debt</b> is crucial to the effectiveness of monitoring...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} {{investigates the}} impact of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>debt</b> ratios of Brazilian firms due to the IFRS adoption. We make a comparison between the forecast of the time-series of debt ratios accounted until 2007 for the span from 2008 to {{the first quarter of}} 2015 with those effectively accounted from 2008 to the first quarter of 2015 derived from the new accounting standard. The research utilizes SARIMAX model and Chow’s (1960) structural break forecast test, controlling for changes originating from the macroeconomic environment as well. We find evidence of significant <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the <b>debt</b> ratio towards both higher and lower debt with predominance of greater ratios.
