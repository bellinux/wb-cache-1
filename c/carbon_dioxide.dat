If more <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> than usual has been lost by a short period of hyperventilation, breathing will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar partial pressure of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> has returned to 5.3kPa (40mmHg).

40|$|Lithium-rich layered {{electrode}} {{materials are}} of interest as a promising candidate of cathodes for lithiumion batteries because of their excellent electrochemical properties. The electrochemical performance of these materials is mainly regulated by preparation conditions during synthesis and calcination process. Here, microspherical Li 1. 2 Mn 0. 54 Co 0. 13 Ni 0. 13 O 2 (LMNCO) particles are synthesized through steady pH value control with <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxides</b> bubbling method in co-precipitation process using a simple reactor. SEM images present that CP-LMNCO sample prepared through the assistance of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxides</b> has spherical particle morphology, while sample (TP-LMNCO) without <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxides</b> assistance shows large nanoparticles agglomeration. The CP-LMNCO electrode demonstrates superior electrochemical performance, which exhibits capacity retention of 97. 76 % after 100 cycles compared with only 81. 94 % for TP-LMNCO electrode at 1 C (250 mAg(- 1)). Even at a higher current density (5 C), the CP-LMNCO electrode shows reversible capacity up to 105. 4 mA h g(- 1). The remarkably improved electrochemical performance of CP-LMNCO electrode is ascribed to spherical morphology with small surface area which decreases side reactions with electrolyte during cycling and smaller primary sizes which reduce lithium ion (Li+) diffusion distance. Furthermore, the synthesis of spherical materials using metal sulfate with high concentration (up to 5 M) as starting agents are attempted under <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxides</b> assisted conditions, and as-prepared materials also show improved performance.

40|$|The present {{work was}} {{targeted}} {{to design a}} surface against cell seeding and adhering of bacteria, Bacillus subtilis. A multi-walled <b>carbon</b> nanotube/titanium <b>dioxide</b> nano-power was produced via simple mixing of carbon nanotube and titanium dioxide nanoparticles during the sol-gel process followed by heat treatment. Successfully, quercetin was immobilized on the nanocomposite via physical adsorption to form a quercetin/multi-walled <b>carbon</b> nanotube/titanium <b>dioxide</b> nanocomposite. The adhesion of bacteria on the coated-slides was verified after 24 h using confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Results indicated that the quercetin/multi-walled <b>carbon</b> nanotube/titanium <b>dioxide</b> nanocomposite had more negativity and higher recovery by glass surfaces than its counterpart.

5|$|The {{peculiar}} {{geometry of}} the Uranian system causes the moons' poles to receive more solar energy than their equatorial regions. Because the vapor pressure of CO2 is a steep function of temperature, this {{may lead to the}} accumulation of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> in the low-latitude regions of Titania, where it can stably exist on high albedo patches and shaded regions of the surface in the form of ice. During the summer, when the polar temperatures reach as high as 85–90 K, <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> sublimates and migrates to the opposite pole and to the equatorial regions, giving rise to a type of carbon cycle. The accumulated <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> ice can be removed from cold traps by magnetospheric particles, which sputter it from the surface.

5|$|Vigorous {{degassing}} of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> occurs {{from several}} vents in two bogs near Nazko Cone.

A mound with a partially submerged vent had been identified in 2013 with a steady flow of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide.</b> Several new vents with no travertine mound were actively releasing <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> gas in 2015. Analysis of the carbon-13 isotope in the <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> gas emissions suggest a magmatic origin. This has led to the possibility of a volcanic geothermal system, the existence of which has been investigated by Geoscience BC as part of their Targeting Resources for Exploration and Knowledge project. The lack of hot springs and geothermal evidence on the surface suggest that the heat source of such a system would be very deep underground.|$|E

5|$|Because no seismographs {{were close}} enough to the Nazko swarm zone before the {{earthquakes}} began, employees of Natural Resources Canada placed seismographs in the area to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly. An infrasound station is also being established, which is able to measure sound waves that would normally go unnoticed by human hearing. These stations can detect volcanic eruptions and the release of gas at volcanic vents, and can be used in combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within volcanoes. Employees of Natural Resources Canada have also visited two communities that were adjacent to the 2007–2008 earthquake swarm to renew information about the Nazko swarm, collect samples, and examine some of the more poorly studied volcanic deposits in the Nazko region. The Natural Resources Canada employees also measured <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> levels during the earthquake swarm. <b>Carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> is usually discharged at faults in volcanically active areas and can collect in soil and under snow. Because of this, <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> concentrations can provide information on volcanic activity in the subsurface.
