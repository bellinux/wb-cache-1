25|$|The main {{duty of the}} IWC is to keep {{under review}} and revise as {{necessary}} the measures laid down in the Schedule to the Convention which govern the conduct of whaling throughout the world. These measures, among other things, provide for the complete protection of certain species; designate specified areas as whale sanctuaries; set limits on the numbers and size of whales which may be taken; prescribe open and closed seasons and areas for whaling; and prohibit the capture of suckling calves and female whales accompanied by calves. The compilation of <b>catch</b> <b>reports</b> and other statistical and biological records is also required.|$|E
60|$|That {{the papers}} were often {{looked over to}} <b>catch</b> <b>reports</b> of my {{movements}} in Europe, by means of ships arriving {{from different parts of}} the world, was apparent enough; but I scarce knew what to make of the natural and simply affectionate manner in which my name was introduced. It might proceed from a wish to gratify Grace, and a desire to let the sister know all that she herself possessed touching the brother's movements. Then Andrew Drewett's name occurred very frequently, though it was generally in connection with that of his mother, who had evidently constituted herself a sort of regular chaperone for Lucy, more especially during the time she was kept out of the gay world by her mourning. I read several of these passages with the most scrupulous attention, in order to detect the feeling with which they had been written; but the most practised art could not have more successfully concealed any secret of this sort, than Lucy's nature. This often proves to be the case; the just-minded and true among men daily becoming the profoundest mysteries to a vicious, cunning, deceptive and selfish world. An honest man, indeed, is ever a parodox to all but those who see things with his own eyes. This is the reason that improper motives are so often imputed to the simplest and seemingly most honest deeds.|$|E

50|$|FMC {{software}} can note {{the time a}} vessel leaves and returns to port, and the time it is inside or outside designated areas. There may be restrictions on trip length, time in an area, etc., which can be calculated directly from VMS data.

50|$|VMS is a {{planning}} and analysis tool {{as well as}} an aid to operations. Treated as a research database, the cumulative position reports gives an analysis of fishing vessel tracks in search of fish. Coupled with species-specific fishing licenses and <b>catch</b> <b>reports,</b> fisheries managers can estimate the amount of a given fish in an area, the amount taken by fishing vessels, and project overfishing before it happens.|$|E

Black marlin are normally outnumbered in <b>catch</b> <b>reports</b> by the more prolific striped and blue marlin, but some big fish continue to be caught. The traditional method of sport fishing is trolling with natural baits, large ballyhoo being commonly used, while searching for finning fish.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999 {{the total}} <b>catch</b> <b>reported</b> by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation was 35,411 tonnes {{with the two}} biggest <b>catches</b> being <b>reported</b> from the United Kingdom and France which landed 19,108 tonnes and 12.745 tonnes respectively.

[...] Great scallops are fished for using Newhaven scallop dredges although a very small percentage, i.e. less than 5% is gathered by hand by divers. In total the scallop fisher for P. maximus. and for the Queen scallop Aequipecten opercularis are one of the top five fisheries by value in United Kingdom waters. However, the use of towed great to harvest scallops causes damage to the wider ecosystem.|$|R

(Although the name of this body of water remains contentious, we use the name used in Google Earth). Combining, in a Monte Carlo procedure, the number of weirs (after correcting for poor resolution and imagery availability) with assumptions about daily catch and fishing season lengths, we estimate that 1900 (+ 79) weirs contribute to a regional catch up to six times higher than the officially <b>reported</b> <b>catches</b> of 5260 t. These results, which speak to the unreliability of officially reported fisheries sta-tistics, provide the first example of fisheries catch estimates from space, and point to the potential for remote-sensing approaches to val-idate catch statistics and fisheries operations in general...|$|R

40|$|The {{fishing and}} {{aquaculture}} industry {{is one of the}} largest industries of Norway. Enhanced knowledge of the distribution of fish in the ocean is important for an economical and sustainable fishing industry. This study investigates the possibilities of using Gaussian processes for regression within fish catch prediction. A dataset that combines <b>catch</b> <b>reports</b> from the Norwegian shipping company Havfisk ASA with a multitude of ocean-related data is created, and analysed in this thesis. Stochastic variational inference for Gaussian process models is used for the regression, as the method allows the use of Gaussian processes for regression on large datasets. The aim of this study is to assess the suitability of the dataset for fish catch predictions, in addition to evaluating the predictions from the Gaussian process model. Different investigations were performed within; time dependency, clustering analysis, data transformation and feature selection. The investigations indicates that Gaussian processes for regression do reveal a structure in the dataset and that the collected dataset is suitable for fish catch prediction...|$|E

40|$|Individual {{transferable}} quotas (ITQs) assign {{property rights}} in fisheries by granting individual fishers a tradable {{share of the}} total allowable catch (TAC). ITQs were originally proposed to enhance profitability and safety, but may also provide incentives for more conservation-minded fishing practices. Indeed, recent empirical evidence shows {{a reduction in the}} likelihood of stock collapse and a threefold increase in catches two decades after ITQ implementation. Yet these spectacular catch increases follow modest 20 % reductions in <b>reported</b> <b>catches.</b> We used standard fisheries models to analyze whether these catch trends are consistent with the theory underlying conservation benefits from property rights. We find that it appears unlikely that catch increases are attributable to ITQs alone. Improved <b>catch</b> <b>reporting</b> systems are often enacted concurrent with ITQs and may plausibly explain sustained catch increases. The existence of this alternative explanation warrants caution about claims that property rights are the cause of sustainable catch gains...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{used the}} X- 11 census {{technique}} for modelling and forecasting the monthly swordfish (Xiphias gladius) catches in the Greek Seas during 1982 - 1996 and 1997 respectively, using <b>catches</b> <b>reported</b> by the National Statistical Service of Greece (NSSG). Forecasts built with X- 11 were also compared with those derived from ARIMA andWinter’s exponential smoothing (WES) models. The X- 11 method captured {{the features of the}} study series and outperformed the other two methods, in terms of both fitting and forecasting performance, for all the accuracy measures used. Thus, with the exception of October, November and December 1997, when the corresponding absolute percentage error(APE) values were very high (as high as 178. 6 %) because of the low level of the catches, monthly catches during the remaining months of 1997 were predicted accurately, with a mean APE of 12. 5 %. In contrast, the mean APE values of the other two methods for the same months were higher (ARIMA: 14. 6 %; WES: 16. 6 %). The overall good performance of X- 11 andthe fact that it provides an insight into the various components (i. e. the seasonal, trend-cycle and irregular components) of the time series of interest justify its use in fisheries research. The basic features of the swordfish catches revealed by the application of the X- 11 method, the effect of the length of the forecasting horizon on forecasting accuracy and the accuracy of the <b>catches</b> <b>reported</b> by NSSG are also discussed...|$|R
