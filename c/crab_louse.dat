The two {{subspecies}} are morphologically almost identical, but do not normally interbreed, although they will do so in laboratory conditions. From genetic studies, they {{are thought to have}} diverged as subspecies about 30,000–110,000 years ago, when many humans began to wear a significant amount of clothing. A much more distantly related species of hair-clinging louse, the pubic or <b>crab</b> <b>louse</b> (Pthirus pubis), also infests humans. It is visually different from the other two species and is much closer in appearance to the lice which infest other primates. Lice infestation of any part of the body is known as pediculosis.|$|E

50|$|The <b>crab</b> <b>louse</b> or pubic louse (Pthirus pubis) is {{an insect}} {{that is an}} obligate {{ectoparasite}} of humans, feeding exclusively on blood. The <b>crab</b> <b>louse</b> usually {{is found in the}} person's pubic hair. Although the louse cannot jump, it can also live {{in other areas of the}} body that are covered with coarse hair, such as the eyelashes. Humans are the only known hosts of the <b>crab</b> <b>louse,</b> although a closely related species, Pthirus gorillae, infects gorilla populations. The human parasite diverged from Pthirus gorillae approximately 3.3 million years ago. It is more distantly related to the genus Pediculus, which contains the human head and body lice and a louse that affects Chimpanzees and Bonobos.|$|E
50|$|Infestation with <b>crab</b> <b>lice</b> is {{also called}} phthiriasis or phthiriasis pubis.

50|$|The main {{symptom of}} {{infestation}} with <b>crab</b> <b>lice</b> is itching, {{usually in the}} pubic-hair area, resulting from hypersensitivity to louse saliva, which can become stronger over two or more weeks following initial infestation. In some infestations, a characteristic grey-blue or slate coloration appears (maculae caeruleae) at the feeding site, which may last for several days.|$|R

Treatment is often performed by sending advice to parents what insecticide to purchase for the child his siblings. In the of <b>crab</b> <b>lice</b> infestations, treatment is inevitably of the individual consulting the physician or, often, who self-medicates using pediculicide purchased at pharmacy.
