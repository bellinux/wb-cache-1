40|$|Scentless {{chamomile}} Matricaria maritima (L.) ssp. inodora (L.) Dostal and <b>common</b> <b>poppy</b> Papaver rhoeas (L.) are species which {{very often}} infest winter cereal and winter rape crops.

In 2012, five seed samples of scentless chamomile and five samples of <b>common</b> <b>poppy</b> were collected from five winter wheat crop fields in Żuławy Gdańskie where the weed species were very poorly controlled.

These recipes explain alternative methods to create flesh tones used for painting the young, old, and various skin colours, with additional examples found in the fifteenth-century Bolognese Manuscript—Segreti per Colori (Bologna, Biblioteca Universitaria, MS. 2861) [9]. Paints were applied in an involved layering system due to the rich vocabulary used for creating images for manuscripts, panels or walls. Colourants include earth pigments, azurite, copper greens, vermilion, lead white, orpiment and many organic pigments made from saffron, woad, and the kermes insect [32]. Combinations of inorganic and organic sources were also evident, such as the instructions to use stamens from the <b>common</b> <b>poppy</b> plant (Papaver rhoeas), which is mixed with a cinnabar pigment to make a purple colour for shadowing [31].|$|E
40|$|Colour has {{attracted}} {{the interest and}} attention {{of many of the}} most gifted intellects of all time. Ideas of early thinkers were not -and could not have been- grasped on a scientific level without knowledge of a kind that lay far in the future. One character that is being considered is the colourful surfaces of living tissues, which could hardly have been visualized without a corresponding reference to the microscale parallel. Millions of years before man made manipulated synthetic structures, biological systems were using nanoscale architecture to produce striking optical effects. Here we show the microsculpture of the adaxial surface of flower petals from the asphodel, the Stork&#x 27;s-bill and the <b>common</b> <b>poppy</b> by using optical, scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. Microsculpture has been studied in leaves and pollen grains of higher plants. To {{the best of our knowledge}} imaging and nanoscale morphometry of petals has not been reported hitherto. Our findings on flower petals&#x 27; microsculpture may be linked with aspects on colour revealed from ancient literature...|$|E
40|$|Summary 	Organic farming means {{a chance}} for plants to reveal their abilities. We offer better {{conditions}} to the associated plants for their growth and reproduction by no use of chemical herbicides and by using alternative growing methods. 	Organic agrophytocoenoses are significant by higher species richness and cover. There can be found some of endangered species among the weeds, which may be more successful in organic system, therfore the organic type of farming may serve for their protection. The most successful weed species endanger cultural crops on both organic and conventional fields. They become more dangerous {{without the possibility of}} herbicide application. Thanks to this, the strategy of each plant species is more important. That is why the question of weed suppression in organic farming is highly important and frequently asked. 	The aim of this thesis is to analyse weed flora on organic cereals fields and to point out possible factors influencing them. Braun-Blanquet scale of dominance and abundance has been used for the assessment of weed communities. Several different localities were investigated in Benešov district. Influence of winter cereals, spring cereals, previous crop and the tillage system have been assessed. 	Some of the most important weed species were: annual winter weed species in winter cereals, perennials and few annual spring species in spring cereals. Annual weeds were typical for spring cereals sown two years on a one plot, perennials were associated with spring cereals sown after fodder crops. -There were not found any evident differences in weed spectrum in winter cereals based on previous crop. Agrophytocoenosis on fields with conventional and reduced tillage differed. Wider spectrum of perennial species was typical for fields where reduced tillage was applied, differences in annual weed spectrum were also found. Typical species for conventional tillage were for example: marsh woundwort, common couch-grass and <b>common</b> <b>poppy,</b> while, creeping thistle, creeping buttercup, perennial sow-thistle, mugwort, corn chamomile, loose silky-bent and some others were often found on fields where reduced tillage were used. 	The results of the analysis in this thesis mostly lead to the same description of weeds as in literature, but few of the results are different. Thanks to statistically decisive results, it is apparent, how a farmer can affect the plant associations over a long period. Key words: organic farming, weeds, agrophytocoenosis, cereals, weed control, features(characteristic) of weeds...|$|E

At {{the time of the}} listing in 1979 this species was known to exist in only 5 small disjunct populations on very specialized and localized soils. Several factors place dwarf bear poppy in danger of extinction throughout its range. The greatest threat to dwarf bear poppy comes from housing and industrial development. The area currently occupied by the city of Bloomington, Utah covers approximately one third of dwarf bear poppy’s historically known habitat. Strip mining of gypsum deposits in dwarf bear poppy communities also poses a threat to the species. Additional threats come from private collectors taking plants for ornamental and home cultivation. However, the unique soil requirements of the species preclude it from surviving outside of its native range. Plant Guid...|$|R

40|$|Interest in the {{production}} of biomass by means of energy crops has increased over the last 40 years in Europe. In particular, the growing of rapeseed (Brassica napus var. oleifera D.

Experiments presented in this thesis were undertaken to study adaption of rapeseed and Brassica carinata in the Mediterranean type environments in Sardinia. Firstly, to identify the effects of genotype on the phenology, growth, dry matter production, seed yield and yield components of rapeseed and Brassica carinata. Secondly, six genotype of Brassica spp. (four genotype of rapeseed and two of Brassica carinata) were used to study biomass production, contribution of the pre-anthesis assimilates to the seed yield, and their relationship to seed yield.
