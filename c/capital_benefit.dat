After theoretically connecting volunteering with social capital using a household pro-duction framework, the authors then use a unique data set from Vermont to estimate the determinants of the probability of receiving a social <b>capital</b> <b>benefit</b> {{and the level of}} such a benefit. The probability of receiving a social <b>capital</b> <b>benefit</b> from one’s most important nonprofit organization is increased: (a) if it is a religious or social service organization, (b) if one increases their volunteering for the organization, and (c) if one is female, college educated, or in a two-parent family. However, the relative magnitude of volunteering is similar, or relatively small, compared to the other significant deter-minants.

40|$|What role does {{social capital}} {{play in the}} use of {{violence}} in illicit markets? Social capital is a multi-dimensional concept that includes networks, trusts and norms, and researchers have made great progress identifying the role social capital plays in economic development. Economies embedded within a social context characterized by high levels of social <b>capital</b> <b>benefit</b> from lower transactions costs, increased efficiency, and increased innovation. Nevertheless, a sticking point in the literature remains, namely, {{that it is difficult to}} disentangle the effects of social capital from the effects of formal institutions. We argue this ambiguity is the result of social capital studies that focus almost exclusively on licit markets with formal institutions. To remedy this, we look at markets with no formal institutions: illicit markets. We focus on the role of networks and find that social capital can reduce transaction costs and consequently levels of violence, but only if network ties are “bridging” and thus weak. However, if network ties are “bonding” and thus strong, social capital in illicit markets encourages exclusionary relationships and the regular use of violence...|$|E

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{severity}} of the AIDS epidemic in Africa and elsewhere, a pressing public policy concern is how to best design assistance policies for households experiencing an adult death. Better policies will take into account and strengthen existing household coping mechanisms, rather than duplicating or undermining them. In this paper we investigate the nature of coping mechanisms among a sample of households in Kagera, Tanzania in 1991 - 94, by estimating the magnitude and timing of receipts of private transfers, public assistance and loans by households with different characteristics. The empirical strategy addresses three methodological difficulties which are common to any attempt to estimate the impact of, or response to, adult death: selection bias, endogeneity, and heterogeneity. We find that less poor households (i. e. those with more physical and human <b>capital)</b> <b>benefit</b> from larger receipts of private assistance, but receive less public assistance initially after the death. On the other hand, poor households rely more than less poor ones on loans for up to a year after a death. Though the loans in this sample are largely private, these results suggest that the expansion of micro-credit programs as well as targeted grant programs may help the poorest households in areas hard-hit by the AIDS epidemic...|$|E

We show in calibrated exercises that conventionally measured welfare gains from this type of convergence appear relatively limited for the typical emerging country. The traditional theory, then, {{does not seem to}} provide a sufficient rationale for capital account liberalization. Our approach emphasizes instead that poor countries face a number of distortions that prevent the allocation of production inputs to their most efficient uses. Liberalization of the capital account should then be understood as a means to eliminate or reduce these distortions, and it is this effect of liberalization that may create first order gains. As an illustration of this approach, we present a model in which capital account account liberalization improves domestic allocative efficiency because of its effect on property rights. Our theory has implications for the political economy of financial integration. First, we show that politicians may open the capital account as a way of "locking-in" domestic reform, even when they cannot commit to either decision. Second, traditional trade arguments (e. g. Stolper-Samuelson) would argue that in capital-scarce countries, domestic capitalists would oppose financial integration as it reduces the return to capital, while workers would typically favor it. The political economy of financial integration does not seem to reflect these predictions. Often, domestic capitalists favor integration while workers may or may not oppose it...|$|E

The human capital as an absorptive capacity has been investigated in the macro literature by Borensztein et al. (1998) and Xu (2000). The aim of this analysis is to investigate their question at firm level. To test for this, a firm-level unbalanced panel data from Turkish manufacturing industry over the period 1990 - 2001 is used. First, firm-level total factor productivity (TFP) is calculated using the Levinsohn-Petrin methodology. Then, the evidence regarding the productivity spillovers from FDI is provided. The analysis is conducted using both level and growth of TFP as dependent variable. The results of this spillover analysis {{suggest that there are}} negative spillovers through forward linkages on the TFP level but not on the growth rate of TFP.
