40|$|Realizing narrow <b>contact</b> <b>fingers</b> {{with low}} lateral {{resistance}} {{is a major}} goal for the front-side metallization of silicon solar cells. The formation of screen- or stencil-printed <b>contact</b> <b>fingers</b> is governed {{by a variety of}} influencing factors. One of these factors is the surface roughness of the textured silicon wafer. However, only a few investigations have been carried out to investigate this impact in detail. In this study, the influence of arithmetical mean roughness Ra of four differently textured wafer surfaces on contact finger geometry and lateral finger resistance, as well as optical and electrical losses, has been investigated. It will be shown that texture roughness has a considerable impact on the properties of the front-side grid. Narrower <b>contact</b> <b>fingers</b> could be realized on the smoothest texture, leading to a current density gain of Δjsc = + 0. 27 mA/cm 2. On the other hand, increasing texture roughness has affected the amount of transferred paste and, thus, has led to a lower lateral finger resistance RL. Thus, <b>contact</b> <b>fingers</b> on the roughest texture have benefited from a fill factor gain of ΔFF = + 0. 24 %abs. A sensitivity analysis of both impacts has shown that the current density gain has overcompensated the fill factor loss. Thus, textures with a small roughness are beneficial with respect to the formation and electrical properties of stencil-printed front-side grids...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} methods to improve the efficiency of crystalline solar cells is the implementation of so-called selective emitters. This is the decoupling of the requirements for the front doping for light conversion and metallization. Underneath the <b>contact</b> <b>fingers,</b> a high doping is chosen to insure a good ohmic contact, whereas in the photoactive area a light doping is employed to reduce recombination losses and increase quantum efficiency in the short wavelength region of the device. Besides using costly and lengthy masking processes, selective emitters can be produced using lasers by means of laser doping. A laser beam with a suitable wavelength with good absorption in silicon is focused to a spot size which matches the width of the <b>contact</b> <b>fingers.</b> In this paper the process is explained, results are presented which show that the targeted effect can be achieved without detrimental "side effects", and an optical beam splitter technology for high throughput production is proposed...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} three screen-printed metallization concepts for back-contact back-junction silicon solar cells {{with an edge}} length of 156 mm: 1) a busbar-less concept with periodically interrupted <b>contact</b> <b>fingers</b> for wire-based interconnection; 2) a single-layer concept with printed busbars and periodically interrupted contact fingers; and 3) a multilayer concept consisting of continuous <b>contact</b> <b>fingers,</b> an insulation layer, and busbar metallization. A comprehensive simulation study is presented for all investigated metallization concepts, yielding their respective performance loss mechanisms. The multilayer approach is found to provide superior conversion efficiencies η, compared with the single-layer approach.

Mainly focusing on large-size multitouch screens, existing solutions typically require {{at least three}} fingers and bimanual interaction for full 6 DOF manipulation. However, single-hand, two-finger operations are preferred especially for portable multitouch devices (e. g., popular smartphones) to cause less hand occlusion and relieve the other hand for necessary tasks like holding the devices. Our key idea for full 6 DOF control using only two <b>contact</b> <b>fingers</b> is to introduce two manipulation modes and two corresponding gestures by examining the moving characteristics of the two fingers, instead {{of the number of}} fingers or the directness of individual fingers as done in previous works.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, a new {{dispensing}} {{print head}} is introduced covering an operational width of 16 cm and therefore allowing for solar cell processing at industrial throughput rates. Like in previous ten nozzle versions, the interior paste flow {{was designed by}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using rheological parameters of applied Ag-pastes (commercially available pastes), including yield stress, shear thinning and wall slip behaviour. The novel print head features a homogeneous distribution of Ag-paste from an inlet supply with a diameter of Din = 2 mm to an outlet slot with a width of ws = 160 mm. A first printing test followed by geometrical characterization of the dispensed contacts revealed a distribution of the contact finger width of wf = 35 ± 1 μm across the whole wafer (156 x 156 mm 2) which demonstrates highest precision of the approach. The print head is directly integrated in an inline feasible dispensing platform, developed by ASYS GmbH.

40|$|Light {{touch of}} the index finger with a {{stationary}} surface at non-mechanically supportive force levels (< 100 g) greatly attenuates the body sway of standing subjects. In three experiments, we evaluated the properties of <b>finger</b> <b>contact</b> and of the contacted object necessary to produce postural stabilization in subjects standing heel-to-toe with eyes closed, {{as well as how}} accurately hand position can be controlled. Experiment 1 involved <b>finger</b> <b>contact</b> with flexible filaments of different bending strengths, a flat surface, and an imagined spatial position. Contact with the flat surface was most effective in attenuating sway; the flexible filaments were much less effective but still significantly better than imagined contact. Experiment 2 compared the effectiveness of <b>finger</b> <b>contact</b> with a flexible filament, a rigid filament of the same diameter, a flat surface, and an imagined spatial position. The rigid filament and flat surface conditions were equally effective in attenuating body sway and were greatly superior to contact with the flexible filament, which was superior to imagined contact. Experiment 3 included five conditions: arms by sides; finger "contact" with an imagined spatial position; <b>finger</b> <b>contact</b> with a flat surface; <b>finger</b> <b>contact</b> with a flexible filament attempting to maintain it bent; and contact with the flexible filament attempting not to bend it. The arms by sides and finger "contact" with an imagined position conditions did not differ significantly; all three conditions involving actual <b>finger</b> <b>contact</b> showed significantly less center of pressure and hand sway, but contact with the flat surface was most effective in attenuating both postural and hand displacement. In all three experiments, the level of force applied in fingertip contact conditions was far below that necessary to provide mechanical stabilization.
