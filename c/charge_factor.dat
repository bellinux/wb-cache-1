The SOM factor ρ(2 β) k+ 1 is input as the shielding factor for all B q k expressions, which enters in the calculations of the crystal-field strength parameter, NV. The maximum splitting ΔE of the 7 F 1 manifold of the Eu 3 + ion is then obtained as a function of NV. It has been developed another way to calculate alpha, which is an expansion factor in the ΔE expression. For the glass, as the mean metal-ligating ions distances are larger than for the crystals, NV and ΔE are smaller, as expected. The prediction of the PCEM shows a linear dependence between ΔE and NV, even though the known mismatch in respect to the experimental splitting is kept. In the case of the SOM, two situations have been analyzed: firstly the <b>charge</b> <b>factor</b> varies in order to reproduce the experimental splitting (a phenomenological procedure); secondly the <b>charge</b> <b>factor</b> is the valence of the oxygen ions.

40|$|ABSTRACT After nonfluoroscopic {{placement}} (NFP) of {{a feeding}} tube, a conventional radiograph is obtained {{to determine the}} location of the catheter tip. At our institu-tion, ideal position for enteral feeding is the distal duode-num or beyond, and multiple radiographs may be needed to confirm migration to this location. Acquiring the num-ber of films needed to achieve this goal may be time consuming and costly. The aim of this project was to determine the relative charge of NFP, on the basis of successful placement confirmed radiographically, to that of fluoroscopic placement. We determined the number of films needed and the relative charge of NFP in 257 patients (157 men, 100 women; mean age, 6 O. years) over a 4 -month period. At our institution, the relative <b>charge</b> <b>factor</b> of a single abdominal film us. fluoroscopic feeding tube placement was 0. 54. Results showed that on the first radiograph, the tip of the feeding tube was in the duode-num or jejunum in 95 (37 %) of 257 patients and in the stomach or esophagus in the remaining 162 patients. Additional films were obtained for 143 patients, for a combined total of 458 (mean, 3. 2 films per patient in this group). Therefore the relative charge for NFP in patients who needed just one film was half that of our fluoroscopic charge; however, the cost of conventional radiographs was nearly twice (1. 73) that of the fluoroscopic method in patients who underwent NFP if multiple films were needed. These results suggest that failure 'of NFP after several films are obtained warrants consideration of fluo-roscopic placement.

A check of the existing deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) data at low values of the transferred momentum Q is necessary ingredient of a parton distribution functions (PDFs) fit. In principle, the concept of PDFs is applicable only at asymptotically big values of Q, where the QCD factorization is proved, while in the limit of small Q it breaks due to the power corrections, which include the target mass effects and the dynamical high-twist (HT) contribution. Poor theoretical understanding of the latter does not allow to estimate the region of Q, where the power corrections can be neglected, from the first principles; only phenomenological studies can separate effect of the HT terms.

40|$|Transuranic {{actinides}} {{dominate the}} long-term radiotoxicity in spent LWR fuel. In an open fuel cycle, they impose a long-term burden on geologic repositories. Transmuting these materials in reactor systems {{is one way}} to ease the long-term burden on the repository. Examining the maximum possible burning of trans-uranic elements in Combined Non-Fertile and UO[subscript 2] (CONFU) PWR assemblies is evaluated. These assemblies are composed of a mix of standard UO[subscript 2] fuel pins and pins made of recycled trans-uranics (TRU) in an inert matrix, and are designed to fit in current or future PWRs. Applying appropriate limits on the neutronic and thermal safety parameters, a CONFU-Burndown (CONFU-B) assembly design is shown to attain net TRU destruction in each fuel batch through at least 9 recycles. This represents a time span of nearly 100 years of in-core residence and out-of-core storage time. In this way, when the TRU is multirecycled, only fission products and separation/reprocessing losses are sent to the repository, and the initial inventory of TRU is reduced over time. Thus, LWRs are able to eventually operate in a fuel cycle system with an inventory of transuranic actinides much lower than that accumulated to date. Three recycling strategies are considered, all using a 4. 5 -year in core irradiation, followed by cooling and reprocessing. The three strategies involve a short-term cooling (6 -year) after discharge, a longer-term cooling (16. 5 -year) after discharge, or a strategy called Remix. The Remix strategy involves partitioning the Pu/Np after 6 -year cooling for immediate recycle, and partitioning the Am/Cm for an additional 10. 5 -year cooling before remixing it into the next CONFU-B batch. At equilibrium, the CONFU-B can burn approximately 1. 5 kg to 10. 0 kg of TRU per TWhe depending on the recycle strategy used. This represents a net burning rate of 2 - 8 % of the TRU loaded per assembly, in addition to burning an amount equivalent to the TRU produced in the UO[subscript 2] pins. However, the highly heterogeneous nature of these assemblies can result in fairly high intraassembly pin power peaking. By design, an IMF pin in the assembly carries the highest power to maximize the TRU destruction. For the initial TRU loading, the highest power peaking in an IMF pin is 1. 183. This is compensated by having cooler pins in the immediate vicinity. Even so, the pin peaking distribution in the assembly can result in reduced thermal margins. The assembly mentioned above has an MDNBR of 1. 43, instead of 1. 62 for the all-UO[subscript 2] assembly, based on a core-wide radial peak-to-average assembly power peaking of 1. 50. Use of neutron poisons and tailored enrichment schemes reduces the neutronic reactivity of fresh assemblies, while improving MDNBR to 1. 51. In addition, RELAP was used to evaluate the fuel behavior under large break LOCA conditions. CONFU-B performance under these conditions was comparable to the standard all-UO 2 assembly. Several options for spent fuel recycling in LWRs are compared economically, and all are found to be more costly than making fresh UO 2 fuel from mined ore. However, the CONFU-B strategy is less costly on a mills/kWhe basis than other thermal recycling strategies that recycle the full TRU vector. Given OECD estimates for the unit costs of each fuel type, and assuming 10 % carrying <b>charge</b> <b>factor,</b> this cost is 10. 0 mills/kWhe for the CONFU-B recycle, compared to 22. 2 mills/kWhe for MOX-UE and 5. 4 mills/kWhe for all UO[subscript 2]. Note that these FCCs assume the 2 disposal fee collected during power generation of a previous cycle can be invested while the fuel is cooling and provide a credit to the cycle that uses the fuel after reprocessing. The fuel handling challenges of multirecycling TRU in CONFU-B assemblies are compared to other multi-recycling strategies. If we assume that the spent fuel from the seventh recycle in each strategy is no longer recyclable and must be sent to the repository in its entirety, the CONFU-B strategy still places much less total burden on the repository than the once-through cycle, and even less burden than the current MOX cycle. Finally, a methodology for calculating the time integrated proliferation risk of a fuel cycle is introduced. An innovation of this methodology is the discounting of future risks to calculate an overall present value risk of a given cycle. Under this methodology, the CONFU-B presents lower risks than other multi-recycling strategies in the first 100 years. For a 10 % rate of discount of risk, the CONFU-B risks are comparable to the once-through cycle. The longer term risk favors recycling due to the limited accumulation of repository risk...|$|E

[1] we have shown that the Sachs <b>charge</b> form <b>factor</b> Gn E (q 2) and charge radius r 2 n = − 6 (d/dq 2) Gn E (q 2) | q 2 = 0 of the neutron are dominated by quark-antiquark pair exchange currents shown in Fig. 1 (b-c). The latter describe the gluon and pion degrees of freedom, while the one-body currents in Fig. 1 (a) describe the valence quark degrees of freedom in the nucleon. The two-body exchange charge operator contains a spindependence of the schematic form ρ[2] ∝ σi · σjY 0 (q) − √ 6 2 [[σi × σj] 2 × Y 2 (q) ] 0. This gives different matrix elements for quark pairs in spin 0 and spin 1 states. Because a down-down pair in the neutron is always in a spin 1 state, while an up-down pair can be in spin 0 or spin 1 states, an asymmetry in the charge distribution of up and down quarks arises. Consequently, a nonvanishing neutron <b>charge</b> form <b>factor</b> (see Fig. 2) and radius is obtained [1]: r 2 n b 2 = − δg(b) + δπ(b) = −...|$|R
