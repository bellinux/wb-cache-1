5|$|For {{the next}} four centuries, the Kingdom of Croatia was ruled by the Sabor (parliament) and a Ban (viceroy) {{appointed}} by the king. The period saw increasing threat of Ottoman <b>conquest</b> <b>and</b> struggle against the Republic of Venice for control of coastal areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{divisions}} {{have changed}} over time, reflecting: territorial losses to Ottoman <b>conquest</b> <b>and</b> subsequent Croatian recapture of some territory; changes in the political status of Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Istria; and political circumstances, including the personal union and settlement between Croatia and Hungary.|$|E

5|$|A key {{strategy}} was {{the establishment of}} colonial towns across the territories that underwent the process of <b>conquest</b> <b>and</b> colonisation; {{they were used to}} project Spanish power over the surrounding countryside. The Spanish were particularly horrified by the Mesoamerican religious practice of human sacrifice, prompting them to attempt to eradicate the native religion.|$|E
5|$|Accounts of {{the conquest}} {{as seen from}} the point of view of the {{defeated}} highland Maya kingdoms are included in a number of indigenous documents, including the Annals of the Kaqchikels, which includes the Xajil Chronicle describing the history of the Kaqchikel from their mythical creation down through the Spanish <b>conquest</b> <b>and</b> continuing to 1619. A letter from the defeated Tz'utujil Maya nobility of Santiago Atitlán to the Spanish king written in 1571 details the exploitation of the subjugated peoples.|$|E

5|$|Croatia {{was first}} {{subdivided}} into {{counties in the}} Middle Ages. The divisions changed over time to reflect losses of territory to Ottoman <b>conquest</b> <b>and</b> subsequent liberation of the same territory, changes of political status of Dalmatia, Dubrovnik and Istria. Traditional division of the country into counties was abolished in the 1920s, when the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and subsequent Kingdom of Yugoslavia introduced oblasts and banovinas respectively.|$|E
5|$|Early 4X {{games were}} {{influenced}} by board games and text-based computer games from the 1970s. Cosmic Balance II, Andromeda <b>Conquest</b> <b>and</b> Reach for the Stars were published in 1983, and are now seen retrospectively as 4X games. Although Andromeda Conquest was only a simple game of empire expansion, Reach for the Stars introduced the relationship between economic growth, technological progress, and conquest.|$|E
5|$|From {{the classic}} {{language}} {{to the present}} day, a body of literature has been written in Mayan languages. The earliest texts to have been preserved are largely monumental inscriptions documenting rulership, succession, and ascension, <b>conquest</b> <b>and</b> calendrical and astronomical events. It is likely that other kinds of literature were written in perishable media such as codices made of bark, only four of which have survived the ravages {{of time and the}} campaign of destruction by Spanish missionaries.|$|E

5|$|From {{the sixth}} century, Scotland {{experienced}} {{a process of}} Christianisation, traditionally seen as carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries, including St Ninian, St Kentigern and St Columba {{and to a lesser}} extent those from Rome and England. However, Gilbert Markus highlights the fact that most of these figures were not church-founders, but were usually were active in areas where Christianity had already become established, probably through gradual diffusion that is almost invisible in the historical record. This would have included trade, <b>conquest</b> <b>and</b> intermarriage.|$|E

5|$|In 616 Æthelfrith of Bernicia, an Anglo-Saxon King, {{crossed the}} Pennines with an army and passed through Manchester {{to defeat the}} Britons in the Battle of Chester.

5|$|It is {{possible}} that the Chajoma of Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) initially allied themselves with the Spanish together with the Kaqchikel kingdom of Iximche, and that they also rebelled against the Spanish in 1524. It is known that when the lords of Iximche broke their alliance with the conquistadors, they took refuge in Jilotepeque. The site was abandoned after the Spanish <b>conquest</b> <b>and</b> the inhabitants were moved by the Spanish to San Martín Jilotepeque, after which the area was never reoccupied.|$|E
5|$|Polyethnicity {{refers to}} the {{proximity}} of people from different ethnic backgrounds within a country or other specific geographic region. It also relates to the ability and willingness of individuals to identify themselves with multiple ethnicities. It occurs when multiple ethnicities inhabit a given area, specifically through means of immigration, intermarriage, trade, <b>conquest</b> <b>and</b> post-war land-divisions. This has had many political and social implications on countries and regions.|$|E
5|$|The regime {{promoted}} {{the concept of}} Volksgemeinschaft, a national German ethnic community. The goal was to build a classless society based on racial purity and the perceived need to prepare for warfare, <b>conquest</b> <b>and</b> a struggle against Marxism. The German Labour Front founded the Kraft durch Freude (KdF; Strength Through Joy) organisation in 1933. In addition to taking control {{of tens of thousands}} of previously privately run recreational clubs, it offered highly regimented holidays and entertainment such as cruises, vacation destinations and concerts.|$|E

5|$|This {{westbound}} expansion {{was accompanied}} by the regress at the southeastern bounds of the Baltic range caused by the advancing Slavs, the Balts' closest relatives. A majority of the Baltic peoples, whose population {{at the end of}} first millennium AD is estimated at about 480 thousand, became extinct during the later Middle Ages because of attempts of forced Christianisation, <b>conquest</b> <b>and</b> extermination, or assimilation, the Old Prussians being the primary example. Lithuanians and Latvians are the surviving Baltic peoples.|$|E
5|$|While the encomienda colonial labour-supply {{system was}} in the process of being established, slave raids became a part of the cycle of conquest. The Spanish would round up {{indigenous}} peoples, brand them as slaves, and trade them at ports on the Gulf of Mexico for horses and weaponry, allowing further <b>conquest</b> <b>and</b> the acquisition of new slaves for trade.|$|E
5|$|A {{story was}} told that Ælfric {{introduced}} monks into the cathedral church of Christ Church, Canterbury, replacing the secular clerks that {{had taken over the}} foundation during the ninth century. Ælfric is said to have done this on the command of the pope. This story originally dates to soon after the Norman <b>Conquest</b> <b>and</b> originated with the monastic historians of Canterbury, and its veracity is unclear. He likely performed the marriage ceremony of King Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy in 1002. A later tradition held that he consecrated a Bishop of Llandaff and two Bishops of St. David's in Wales, which, if true, would have meant extending Canterbury's jurisdiction into new territory.|$|E
