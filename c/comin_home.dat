40|$|This {{chapter is}} based on a {{conversation}} with Antonio <b>Comin</b> at his <b>home</b> in South Australia in 2009, edited and annotated by Linda Barwick. Antonio Comin (born Cornuda, Italy, in 1933) migrated with his family to Australia in 1936. A graduate of the University of Sydney and the Università degli Studi di Firenze, he taught at the universities of Sydney, Melbourne and British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada) before joining Flinders University in 1970 as foundation Professor of Italian. Until his retirement in 1996, his main teaching and research areas were Italian language, dialectology and traditional culture. Comin’s mission to establish and promote in South Australia the understanding of Italian language and culture was undertaken in large part through various theatrical productions he devised and mounted from 1976 – 2007, which increasingly incorporated his own writing as well as musical components including Italian traditional song. After covering background about Comin’s early life and cultural formation in Australia and Italy, the chapter presents Comin’s commentary on the various theatrical productions he conceived and directed.
