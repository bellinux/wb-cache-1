A narrow-band frequency modulation (plus or minus 7 kHz) of the RF is used to achieve maximum operating range with minimum transmitting power. The radiated power is limited {{to stay within the}} 50 microvolts/m at 15 m FCC requirement for low-power transmitters in the 88 - to 108 -MHz band. This technique offers a number of advantages. First only manufacturer's type approval is required for the device and the user does not need a license. Second maximum operating range can be achieved within the FCC power limitations by using a narrow-band that is consistent with the required medical information bandwidth. A third advantage in using the 88 - to 108 -MHz band is that the commercial FM stations are relatively widely spaced and carefully regulated so that by selecting the transmitter's frequency in the guard band between stations, minimum interference from other transmitter sources is encountered...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{in general terms}} the design and performance of the first experimental model of the N. R. C. coherent pulse radar equipment. A line of these early warning stations across the north of Canada is visualized to relieve the load on the main defenence system. Two fixed, narrow azimuth, vertical fan beams are directed obliquely from each station in the fence, with an average station separation of 30 miles. Coherent pulse and integration techniques are used to distinguish moving targets from permanent echoes. The antenna pattern is 100 in azimuth and cosecant to 40, 000 ft. The <b>crystal-controlled</b> <b>transmitter</b> emits 5 KM peak, 203 ̆bcs pulses on 600 Mc. Automatic alarm of moving targets is provided with course range discrimination. No operator is needed but maintenance will be required. Ranges up to 70 miles have been obtained on random aircraft, although formal flight trials have not been carried out yet. Under moderate clutter conditions the system is stable, without false alarms, and operates on aircraft echoes 3 db above noise. In severe clutter the operation is not yet entirely satisfactory.

40|$|Phase {{measurements}} of waves reflecting {{from the lower}} regions of the ionosphere using frequencies in the range 15 to 100 kc/s furnish a new method of investigating the effects of solar activity on radio communication. In an effort to explore this method of measurement the Ionospheric Research Project of the California Institute of Technology constructed a complete 50 -kc/s station in the Mojave desert with the transmitter near Randsburg and the receiver near Victorville. This paper describes the equipment requirements of the station, and a paper by R. S. Macmillan (Cf. Ref. 1) will present the theoretical aspects of the data that were obtained. A <b>crystal-controlled</b> <b>transmitter</b> was used to drive a half-wave resonant dipole, which at 50 kc/s was 8600 feet long. The antenna pattern was such that radiated power was directed upward to the inosphere and thence back to the receiving site by means of reflection. The necessary reference signal {{was sent to the}} receiving site by means of a very-high-frequency, frequency-modulated transmitter. A double superheterodyne receiver received the 50 -kc/s signal and converted it to 1. 61 kc/s. This output was then compared by means of a phase meter with a 1. 61 -kc/s reference, derived from the 50 kc/s reference signal. The output of the phase meter was filtered (bandwidth= 1 c/s) and then recorded. A commercial field-strength meter (bandwidth= 350 c/s) was used in conjuction with this receiver to obtain the amplitude of the reflected wave...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 10 - 12, 1972 / International Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaA miniature, single-channel, <b>crystal-controlled</b> <b>transmitter</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} for biomedical applications. A narrowband frequency modulation (± 7 kHz) of the RF is used to achieve maximum operating range with minimum transmitting power. The radiated power is limited {{to stay within the}} 50 μv/m at 15 m FCC requirement for low power transmitters (Part 15. 212 FCC Regulations) in the 88 to 108 MHz band. This technique offers a number of advantages. First only manufacturer’s type approval is required for the device and the user does not need a license. Second maximum operating range can be achieved within the FCC power limitations by using a narrowband that is consistent with the required medical information bandwidth. A third advantage in using the 88 to 108 MHz band is that the commercial FM stations are relatively widely spaced and carefully regulated so that by selecting the transmitter’s frequency in the guard band between stations, minimum interference from other transmitter sources is encountered. For EKG and EEG applications, where an information bandwidth of 0. 1 to 150 Hz is adequate, a subcarrier with a fixed frequency (approximately 1 kHz) is used with differential pulse width modulation (DPWM). This type of subcarrier has the advantage of simple circuitry for both the transmitter and demodulator. Since DPWM is self-aligning, it can be handled effectively by magnetic tape recorders having relatively high tape speed errors. For EMG and other high frequency data signals the RF can be directly frequency modulated without the use of a subcarrier...|$|E
