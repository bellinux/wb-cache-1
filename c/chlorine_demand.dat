5000|$|The {{presence}} of chlorine in traditional swimming pools {{can be described}} as a combination of free available chlorine (FAC) and combined available chlorine (CAC). While FAC is composed of the free chlorine that is available for sanitizing the water, the CAC includes chloramines, which are formed by the reaction of FAC with amines (introduced into the pool by human perspiration, saliva, mucus, urine, and other biologics). [...] Chloramines are responsible for the [...] "chlorine smell" [...] of pools, as well as skin and eye irritation. These problems are the result of insufficient levels of free available chlorine, and indicate a pool that must be [...] "shocked" [...] by the addition of 5-10 times the normal amount of chlorine. [...] In saltwater pools, the generator uses electrolysis to continuously produce free chlorine. It also burns off chloramines {{in the same manner as}} traditional shock (oxidizer). As with traditionally chlorinated pools, saltwater pools must be monitored in order to maintain proper water chemistry. Low chlorine levels can be caused by insufficient salt, incorrect (low) chlorine-generation setting on the SWG unit, higher-than-normal <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand,</b> low stabilizer, sun exposure, or mechanical issues with the chlorine generator. Salt count can be lowered due to splash-out, backwashing, and dilution via rainwater.|$|E

40|$|Disinfection is {{the last}} {{treatment}} stage of a Drinking Water Treatment Plant (DWTP) and is carried out to maintain a residual concentration of disinfectant in the water distribution system. Chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) is a widely used chemical employed for this purpose. The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of several treatments on chlorine dioxide consumption and on chlorite and chlorate formation in the final oxidation/disinfection stage. A number of tests was performed at laboratory scale employing water samples collected from the DWTP of Cremona (Italy). The following processes were studied: oxidation with potassium permanganate, chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite, coagulation/flocculation with ferric chloride and aluminum sulfate, filtration and adsorption onto activated carbon. The {{results showed that the}} <b>chlorine</b> dioxide <b>demand</b> is high if sodium hypochlorite or potassium permanganate are employed in pre-oxidation. On the other hand, chlorine dioxide leads to the highest production of chlorite and chlorate. The coagulation/flocculation process after pre-oxidation shows that <b>chlorine</b> dioxide <b>demand</b> decreases if potassium permanganate is employed as an oxidant, both with ferric chloride and aluminum sulfate. Therefore, the combination of these processes leads to a lower production of chlorite and chlorate.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the removal profiles of total amino acids (TAAs), total dissolved amino acids (TDAAs), biodegradable organic carbon (BDOC) and <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> in a biological filter operating {{in cold water}} (< 2 ° C). Biological filtration achieved a removal of 46 % for TDAAs (0. 08 ± 0. 04 mg C l- 1) and a removal of 24 % for BDOC (0. 2 ± 0. 1 mg C l- 1). Since the filter studied was functioning in biological mode, {{these results suggest that}} TDAAs have a higher biodegradability than that shown by the global BDOC pool. The use of the CHABROL model, which predicts BDOC removal in biological filters, permitted comparison of the TDAA removal profile with removal profiles associated with the three classes of BDOC distinguished by the model. The theoretical <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> associated with TAAs, calculated with individual amino acid chlorine demands, varied from 5. 6 to 6. 4 mg Cl 2 per mg TAA. The removal of the <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> associated with TAA removal (0. 5 ± 0. 15 mg Cl 2) accounted for 34 % of the 240 hour water <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> removal, corrected {{to take into account the}} <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> of ammonia. This percentage is higher than that associated with the participation of TAA removal in the removal of TOC (16 %). These results reflect the high chlorine reactivity of amino acids with chlorine.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} various factors (N/Cl ratio used to prepare monochloramine, monochloramine doses, pH and contact time) on the monochloramine demand {{and on the}} {{chloroform}} yield during chloramination of resorcinol have been investigated. Chloramination experiments were carried out at 24 ± 1 °C, at pH values ranging from 6. 5 to 12 using a bicarbonate/carbonate buffer and preformed monochloramine solutions prepared at pH 8. 5 with N/Cl ratios ([NH 4 Cl] 0 /[Total free Cl 2] 0 ranging from 1. 0 to 150 mol/mol). Kinetic experiments ([Resorcinol] 0 = 5 or 100 μM, [NH 2 Cl] 0 /[Resorcinol] 0 = 20 mol/mol, pH = 8. 5 ± 0. 1) showed a slow increase of the monochloramine consumption with reaction time. The monochloramine demands after reaction times of 7 days ([Resorcinol] 0 = 100 μM) and 14 days ([Resorcinol] 0 = 5 μM) were equal to 8. 5 mol of NH 2 Cl/mole of resorcinol and were higher than the <b>chlorine</b> <b>demands</b> (≈ 7. 3 mol/mol).

The source waters and sequentially filtered samples were dosed with chlorine and the residual chlorine data were used to estimate the TC demand of these waters. A robust chlorine decay model constructed in AQUASIM software was used to do so. More than 80 % of the <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> in untreated surface water sources was found to be contributed mainly by NOMs that were larger than 3, 500 Da.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the decay of {{chlorine}} in pipes of drinking water distribution networks due to wall and bulk demand. Accurate prediction of chlorine decay is important, as both chlorine concentrations which are too low and too high pose serious health risks, the former due to pathogen formation and the latter due {{to the formation of}} disinfection by-products. Water quality models used for the prediction of chlorine decay make use of parameterisations for the wall demand in the form of Sherwood number Sh correlations, which couple the wall mass flux to a Reynolds number Re, Schmidt number Sc and wall roughness. These correlations are subject to significant uncertainty, particularly for turbulent flows. A combined analytical and numerical approach is taken to study in detail the interaction between flow, turbulence and mass transport, with the aim of improving the understanding and accuracy of wall <b>demand</b> parameterisations for <b>chlorine.</b> Simulations of the chlorine decay in an axisymmetric pipe with hydraulically smooth walls were performed for Re = 104 to 106 and Sc = 1000 using Reynolds averaged conservation equations. These values are typical for chlorine transport in distribution networks. The simulations confirmed that the assumptions made in water quality models for <b>chlorine</b> wall <b>demand</b> are valid. Asymptotic solutions for high Sc solutes were developed which are applicable both to linear and nonlinear wall reactions. Results showed that the Sh correlation is independent of the reaction type. For rough walls, the two main wall demand parameterisations are mutually inconsistent: one is valid for low and the other for high wall demand coefficients only. Numerical simulation of flow and high Sc mass transport over a dtype rough surface at Re = 2. 5 × 105 showed that the inconsistency between the two parameterisations was caused by the geometry. For low wall demand coefficients, the existence of roughness elements causes higher wall demand than for a smooth wall. However, at high wall demand coefficients the maximum wall demand achievable in the cavities was much smaller than for the crests. Hence, the effective surface area and therefore the wall demand became lower than for a smooth wall. A parameterisation was developed which reproduced the solute mass decay over the entire range of wall demand coefficients. Most of the solutions and parameterisations developed in this thesis are on the same level of description as water quality models. The findings of this thesis can be used as supportive evidence for the validity of assumptions made for water quality models, and to inform how processes should be modelled when these assumptions are violated.

The municipal wastewater effluents are {{considered one of the}} environmental threats that impact the water quality of the streams. This study was conducted to assess the environmental impact that the wastewater effluent has on the Klip River system, the performance of the plant and also to assess the spatial and temporal variations of water quality along the Klip River system. The study focused mainly on historical data over a five period (2009 – 2013) years secondary data which was analysed by Johannesburg Water Ltd (Pty) and primary data were also collected and analysed using the standard methods of laboratory analysis. The standard methods used include Ion selective electrode, gravimetric techniques, iodemetric titration, membrane filtration method; colorimetric method, automated flow injection method and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP – AES). The aim of collecting the primary data during the dry and wet seasons was to verify the secondary data. The data set was further analysed using multivariate techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA) and discriminant analysis (DA) to determine the spatial and temporal variation of water quality. The data set using ten water quality parameters (ammonia, sulphates, <b>Chlorine,</b> Chemical Oxygen <b>Demand,</b> conductivity, Escherichia coli, sodium, nitrates, pH and suspended solids) was grouped into four sampling points (influent, effluent, downstream and upstream points) and four seasons. Discriminant analysis of water quality showed that out of ten water quality parameters analysed, only sulphates was a less significant parameter to discriminate between the sampling points. For the temporal variations, eight water quality parameters (ammonium, Chlorine, Conductivity, sodium, nitrates, pH, sulphates and suspended solids are the most significant parameters to discriminate between the four seasons. PCA/FA results highlighted similarities in terms of water quality loading between summer and winter seasons and between the winter and autumn seasons. Summer and winter seasons had strong positive loading in COD, ammonium, suspended solids and E. coli whereas the autumn and spring seasons had strong positive loading in sodium, chlorine and pH. The study further highlighted that the Olifantsvlei Wastewater Treatment Works (WWTW) is effectively treating the wastewater up to the required standards before discharging them into the Klip River system.

40|$|Le suivi de la matière organique totale (COD) et spécifique (substances humiques et principalement acides aminés dissous totaux) dans les eaux d'une filière de {{production}} d'eau potable a mis en évidence des abattements moyens dans l'eau traitée représentant 40 % du COD et 0 à 75 % des acides aminés. Parallèlement, le potentiel de demande en chlore à long terme est diminué de près de 70 %, {{alors que}} la fraction biodégradable connait une élimination de l'ordre de 50 %. Aucune corrélation directe n'a pu être mise en évidence entre les teneurs en acides aminés et la valeur du carbone organique dissous biodégradable (CODB) et de la demande en chlore des eaux brutes ou en cours de traitement. Cependant, compte tenu des teneurs en acides aminés dissous totaux quantifiées dans les eaux traitées de l'usine, leur participation peut être estimée entre 5 et 23 % du potentiel de demande en chlore et entre 5 et 25 % du CODB. La matière organique analysée spécifiquement {{dans le cadre de}} cette étude (substances humiques et acides aminés dissous totaux), représente 20 à 35 % du COD des eaux en fin de filière, et la présence de ces composés organiques serait responsable d'une part notable de la demande en chlore à long terme des eaux (40 à 60 %). Dissolved organic compounds ({{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC), biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC), total amino acids and humic substances) and their <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> were analyzed monthly at different steps of the water treatment plant of Méry-sur-Oise (Paris, France, 270 000 m 3 /d, Fig. 1). Total dissolved amino acids were determined by HPLC analysis with fluorimetric detection after hydrolysis of combined amino acids (proteins, polypeptides) by hydrochloric acid (DOSSIER BERNE et al., 1994 a); the separation of 17 amino acids was performed after orthophthaldialdehyde (OPA) pre-column derivatization. Humic substances were determined according to the method developed by THURMAN and MALCOLM (1981), by gravity feeding XAD- 8 resins with acidified samples. The humic fraction was expressed as the difference between DOC before and after passage through the column. The method developped by JORET and LÉVI (1986) using a biologically active sand inoculum was used for the determination of BDOC. For the determination of chlorine consumption, the kinetic model described by JADAS- HÉCART et al. (1992) was used; it takes into account the long-term <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> in terms of potential demand. This method was automated (DOSSIER BERNE et al., 1994 b) and computer-assisted. The chlorine dose was chosen depending on the DOC value and on the N-NH 4 + content of the water; the applied dose was: 3 mg Cl 2 /mg DOC + 10 mg Cl 2 /mg N-NH 4 +. Chlorine determination was performed automatically by the spectrophotometric N, N-diethylphenylene- 1, 4 -diamine (DPD) method. In raw water, DOC values may reach 5. 6 to 6. 5 mg C l-¹ during the cold season, but the average yield of elimination was generally close to 40 % (Fig. 2). The biodegradable fraction of the organic carbon (BDOC), which represents 25 to 50 % of the DOC in the raw water, was partially removed in the plant and the residual concentration in treated water varied between 0. 4 to 1. 8 mg C l-¹ (Fig. 2). A transitory increase in the BDOC values was generally observed during the ozonation step; it reached 0. 2 to 0. 5 mg C l-¹ (Figs. 6 and 7). Whatever the period of the year, extracted humic substances constituted about 50 % of the DOC found in raw water (Fig. 3). This hydrophobic fraction was significantly removed in the treatment plant reducing the proportion of humic substances in the DOC of treated water to 16 - 23 % (Figs. 3, 6 and 7). The concentrations of total dissolved amino acids ranged from 100 to 260 µg l-¹ C in raw water and from 50 to 150 µg l-¹ C in produced water (Fig. 4); the main part of this elimination occurred during the clarification step (Figs. 6 and 7). No important seasonal variations could be observed for <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> (Fig. 5); its removal occurred at each step of treatment and the average global elimination by the plant was of the order of 70 % (Figs. 6 and 7). On account of the low concentrations of amino acids, no direct relation could be shown between amino acid concentrations and the respective values of BDOC or of <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> potential (Figs. 9 and 10). With regards to BDOC and <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> potential, no correlation could be shown between these two parameters either (Fig. 8). However, it was possible to calculate the contribution of specific classes of dissolved organic compounds to <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> and to BDOC. This calculation is based: i) on the concentrations of humic substances and amino acids measured during the monthly experiments at each point of the treatment plant, ii) on bibliographic data concerning the contribution to BDOC (biodegradability) and chlorine consumption of a large variety of model molecules (free or combined amino acids, aquatic humic substances). The results obtained in this way are reported in Table 3 for the treated water of the M?ry sur Oise plant. These results indicate that the small amounts of total dissolved amino acids present in treated water may account for 5 to 25 % of the BDOC value and for 5 to 23 % of the total <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> potential. With regard to humic substances, their biodegradability was assumed to be very low but their contribution to the <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> of the treated water was estimated between 10 to 40 %, whereas their DOC contribution ranges from 16 to 35 %. As a consequence, both amino acids and humic substances could account for 40 to 60 % to the <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> of treated water. A special point should be noticed for total amino acids: their contribution to the DOC values of treated water was only 2 to 7 %, but they may account for a larger proportion of BDOC or <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> potential (5 to 25 %) ...|$|E

The application of photocatalytic treatment with 1 [*]g[*]L− 1 of TiO 2 during 30 minutes achieves an average degradation of the studied pesticides of 48 %. <b>Chlorine</b> <b>demand,</b> toxicity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration of water are reduced. If hydrogen peroxide is added with a concentration of 10 [*]mM, the average degradation of pesticides increases up to 57 %, although <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> and toxicity of water increase while DOC concentration remains unchanged with this treatment. The application of either photocatalytic treatments does not produce variations in the physical-chemical parameters of water, such as pH, conductivity, colour, dissolved oxygen, and hardness. The pesticides which are best degraded by photocatalytic treatments are parathion methyl, chlorpyrifos, α-endosulphan, 3, 4 -dichloroaniline, 4 -isopropylaniline, and dicofol while the worst degraded are HCHs, endosulphan-sulphate, heptachlors epoxide, and 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{chlorine}} decay {{experiments were}} {{conducted for the}} raw water from Nakdong River that is treated by Chilseo Water Treatment Plant (CWTP) situated in Haman, Korea {{as well as the}} effluents from sand and granular activated carbon (GAC) filters of CWTP and fitted using a chlorine decay model. The model estimated the fast and slow reacting nitrogenous as well as organic/inorganic compounds that were present in the water. It was found that the <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> due to fast and slow reacting (FRA and SRA) organic/inorganic substances was not reduced significantly by sand as well as GAC filters. However, the treated effluents from those filters contained FRA and SRA that are less reactive and had small reaction rate constants. For the effluents from microfiltration, ultrafiltration, and nanofiltration the <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> because FRA and SRA were further reduced but the reaction rate constants were larger compared to those of sand and GAC filter effluents. This has implications in the formation of disinfection by products (DBPs). If DBPs are assumed to form due to the interactions between chlorine and SRA, then {{it is possible that the}} DBP formation potential in the effluents from membrane filtrations could be higher than that in the effluents from granular media filters...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} {{drinking}} water generally deteriorates when it is delivered through a distribution system due to the decay of disinfectant, which subsequently allows the re-growth of microorganisms in the distribution system {{in addition to the}} formation of trihalomethane (THM). Therefore, a model which describes the changes that occur in the water quality in the distribution system is needed to determine whether to enhance the treatment processes or to improve the distribution system so that microbiological criteria are met. In this paper the chlorine decay kinetics and THM formation in treated water is modeled considering the reaction of chlorine with fast and slow reacting organic and nitrogenous compounds which are present in that water. The treated water was also passed through three types of resins to fractionate very hydrophobic acids (VHA), slightly hydrophobic acids (SHA), hydrophilic charged (CHA) and hydrophilic neutral (NEU) compounds which are present in the water. Chlorine decay tests were conducted on the effluents emerging from the resins to evaluate the <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> and THM formation potential of those organic fractions. The model shows that the CHA presented in the waters has a very high THM formation potential (around 62 % of the THM produced). VHA, NEU and CHA contributed to <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> in the water. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} reactions that hypochlorite undergoes {{in the body}} when chlorinated water is ingested have received very little attention. Because amino nitrogen compounds are important components of the average diet, the reactions of hypochlorite with amino compounds in the stomach were investigated. Stomach fluid was recovered from Sprague-Dawley rats that had been fasted for 48 hr and administered 4 mL deionized water. The <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> of the stomach fluid was determined. An average volume-independent demand of 2. 7 mg chlorine was measured. At doses below 40 mg/L chlorine reducing reactions appeared to account for reduction of all oxidizing species within 15 min {{as measured by the}} FAS-DPD titrimetric method. At least part of the <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> is associated with amino acids present in the stomach fluid. Amino acids were identified and quantified in the stomach fluid by precolumn derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). When stomach fluid is chlorinated to concentrations of chlorine between 200 and 1000 mg/L, organic N-chloramines are formed. After derivatization of chlorinated stomach fluid with dansyl sulfinic acid, fluorescent derivatives of chloramines were separated by HPLC. Three chloramino acid derivatives, N-chloroalanine, N-chloroglycine, and N-chlorophenylalanine, were identified by cochromatography with known standards using two chromatographic methods. The yield of a chloramine that would form in stomach fluid on administration of hypochlorite to animals was determined using tritiated piperidine and doses of 200 and 1000 mg/L chlorine. Yields of tritiated N-chloropiperidine in recovered stomach fluid were 70 % and 42 %, respectively, of the theoretical amount expected...|$|E
40|$|A 1. 7 -km {{ocean outfall}} {{has been used}} to {{transport}} saline CEPT (chemically enhanced primary treatment) effluent which was not chlorinated to the receiving water body. Now the effluent is being considered for chlorine disinfection using existing outfall as the chlorine contact chamber to achieve a 2 - 3 log reduction in E. coli counts. As no purposely built sampling locations after outfall system, a simulator study coupled with batch tests has been conducted with a pipe loop which provides a similar contact time and hydraulic regime as that existing in the field to provide valuable information to correlate the E. coli kill with the fmal TRC after the chlorine contact, and show the exact pattern of E. coli disinfection in saline sewage. Experimental results indicate the <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> of CEPT effluent is mostly satisfied within the first 10 minutes of contact, any longer contact will only increase the demand by around 3. 5 % and not lead to any substantial increase in the E. coli kill. The remaining E. coli levels are mainly dependent upon the prevalent TRC levels while their contact times play only a relatively insignificant role. The comprehensive E. coli-TRC correlation curve, coupled with the observed diurnal/monthly <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> variations, apparently suggests that in order to comply with a promulgated E. coli limit, a certain final TRC level must be maintained {{at the end of the}} contact Results from this study can be used as a reference to allow the operator to determine the needed chlorine dosing level in order to meet discharge water quality standards in future full-scale chlorination operation. © 2010 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Optimum {{conditions}} {{to run the}} P Mo stage for bleaching eucalyptus kraft pulp were 90 ºC, pH 3. 5, 2 h, 0. 1 kg/t Mo and 5 kg/t H 2 O 2. The P Mo stage efficiency increased with decreasing pH (1. 5 - 5. 5) and increasing temperature (75 - 90 ºC), time (2 - 4 h), and hydrogen peroxide (3 - 10 kg/t) and molybdenum concentration (0. 1 - 0. 4 kg/t). The implementation of the P Mo stage, as replacement for the A stage, decreased total active <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> of the OAZDP sequence by 6 kg/t to reach 90 % ISO, both in laboratory and mill scale.

40|$|Biofouling and {{biocorrosion}} {{were studied}} {{in drinking water}} and heating water systems by forming biofilms on steel and on polymethylmetacrylate. In the drinking water system, biofilm development was more significant on corroded surfaces, suggesting that in these conditions they were largely protected from disinfection, probably because of sheltering and <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> by corrosion products. In the urban heat supply system, results suggest a higher biofilm activity at lower pH. Sulphate-reducing bacteria were detected in the urban heating biofilms, but little corrosion was observed on steel coupons. Results indicate that surface and bulk medium properties, as well as bacterial diversity are determinant parameters when studying biofouling and biocorrosion.

40|$|Supplying {{drinking}} water in Metropolitan Adelaide to meet contractual and Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (NHMRC/AWRC, 1996) {{is a challenge}} as source waters contain high concentrations of natural organic matter (NOM) that often exceed 10 mg/L dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The US EPA indicates that enhanced coagulation is the best available technology to control DOC in {{drinking water}} treatment plants. United Water has used enhanced coagulation at Metropolitan Adelaide WTP’s since 1997 to improve water quality in the distribution system. NOM reduction has led to treated water with a lower <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> allowing a greater residual penetration enabling improved bacteriological compliance. Disinfection by-product formation has also been controlled within the distribution system.

40|$|<b>Chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> of a {{water sample}} depends on the {{characteristics}} of dissolved organic matter (DOM). It is an important parameter for water utilities used to assess oxidant and/or disinfectant consumption of source waters during treatment and distribution. In this study, model compounds namely resorcinol, tannic acid, vanillin, cysteine, tyrosine, and tryptophan were used to represent the reactive moieties of complex DOM mixtures. The reactivity of these compounds was evaluated in terms of Cldemand and electron donating capacity (EDC). The EDC was determined by mediated electrochemical oxidation (MEO) which involves the use of 2, 2 ′-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as an electron shuttle. The Cldemand of readily oxidizable compounds (resorcinol, tannic acid, vanillin, and cysteine) was found to correlate well with EDC (R =  0. 98). The EDC values (mol e/mol C) of the model compounds are as follows: 1. 18 (cysteine)  >  0. 77 (resorcinol)  >  0. 59 (vanillin)  >  0. 52 (tannic acid)  >  0. 36 (tryptophan)  >  0. 19 (tyrosine). To determine the effect of pre-oxidation on EDC, ozone was added (0. 1  mol O/mol C) into each model compound solution. Ozonation caused a general decrease in EDC (10 – 40 %), <b>chlorine</b> <b>demand</b> (10 – 30 %), and UV absorbance (10 – 40 %), except for tyrosine which showed both increased UVand EDC. Before and after ozonation, 24  h disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation potential tests (Clresidual =  1. 5  mg/L) were conducted to evaluate the use of EDC for DBP formation prediction. The results indicate that there was no significant correlation between the EDC of the model compounds and the formation potentials of adsorbable organic chlorine, trichloromethane, and trichloroacetic acid. This suggests that while EDC correlates with Cldemand, chlorine consumption may not directly translate to DBP formation because oxidation reactions may dominate over substitution reactions. Overall, this study provides useful insights on the reactions of ABTS[rad]and HOCl with model DOM compounds, and highlights the potential application of MEO for rapid determination of Cldemand {{of a water}} sample...|$|E
