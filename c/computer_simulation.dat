The focus is on two questions: how use of <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> can enhance traditional education, and how <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> are best used in order to improve learning processes and outcomes. We report on studies that investigated <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> as a replacement of or enhancement to traditional instruction. In particular, we consider the effects of variations in how information is visualized, how instructional support is provided, and how <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> are embedded within the lesson scenario. The reviewed literature provides robust evidence that <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> can enhance traditional instruction, especially as far as laboratory activities are concerned. However, in most of this research the use of <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> has been approached without consideration of the possible impact of teacher support, the lesson scenario, and the computer simulation’s place within the curriculum...|$|R

This review examines the types and good examples of <b>computer</b> <b>simulations.</b> The literature review indicated that although <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> cannot replace science classroom and laboratory activities completely, they offer various advantages both for classroom and distance education. This paper consists of four parts. The first part describes computer simulations; the second part reviews the benefits in science education; the third part looks for the relation with science process skills; and the last part makes connections with the distance education.

After a brief introduction and some comments on general issues it will be argued that there are in fact new philosophical problems, but that these problems are less numerous than claimed by most advocates. As a final point there will be looked at a recent claim that <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> are ‘just’ opaque thought experiments.

5|$|Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl {{hypothesized}} that the Pacific was settled by voyages from South America {{and set out to}} prove that with his Kon-Tiki expedition. Scholars did not take Heyerdahl's hypothesis seriously. New Zealander Andrew Sharp proposed the accidental voyaging hypothesis in 1957, which (erroneously) argued that Oceania was too vast to have been settled by intentional voyaging so migrations must have happened by accidental drift voyages. Sharp granted that Polynesians likely settled the Pacific from Asia, but held the opinion that their crude vessels and navigational tools were not reliable for intentional sailing from Tahiti to Hawaii or New Zealand. He stated that voyages of more than 300 miles were likely accidental voyages, with landfall at the mercy of wind and current. A 1973 study and <b>computer</b> <b>simulation</b> by Levison, Ward, and Web investigated the probability of Sharp's hypothesis but found it improbable.|$|E

40|$|When <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> {{are popular}} in helping {{students}} understand chemistry in today 2 ̆ 7 s classrooms, {{it is important}} to realize how instructional use of <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> affects students 2 ̆ 7 understanding of science. This dissertation centers around the impact of the use of <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> on college students 2 ̆ 7 learning. Chapter 1 generally addresses the background and the significance of the research topics. Chapter 2 reviews the literature from research that studied the factors that affect the use of <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> in helping students learn science. Learners were found to understand science theories better with descriptions and explanations presented in both verbal and visual formats than in verbal format alone. An individual 2 ̆ 7 s prior knowledge and learning strategies have also been found {{to have an impact on}} her/his response to <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> and therefore affect the potential value of <b>computer</b> <b>simulations.</b> Chapter 3 reveals the impact of the use of <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> on students 2 ̆ 7 understanding of electrochemistry principles. The results confirm findings in earlier studies that college students seemed to be able to build mental models of chemical reactions from formula and equations with or without the help of <b>computer</b> <b>simulations.</b> The study in Chapter 3 indicates that it is likely that the design of the learning activities rather than the use of technology actually had an impact on students learning. Chapter 4 provides insights into how the use of simulations affected the communication between group members and how individuals with different levels of prior knowledge responded to computer programs and interacted with peers. Although prior knowledge was not found to interact with the use of <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> in affecting students 2 ̆ 7 understanding, the findings in Chapter 4 show that prior knowledge seemed to affect the ways that students solved problems and the ways they interacted with the computer simulations.;Taken together, these three studies in this dissertation suggest continuing research needs to be done in identifying and resolving issues when individual differences are considered. In addition, it is important that the design of learning activities be given a higher level of priority than the use of instructional technology when employing <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> in the classrooms...|$|R

40|$|My intent in {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> as an instructional approach for high school physics English Language Learners (ELLs). Comparison-group research was employed to assess differences in ELLs? learning with <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> demonstrating Newton's Third Law in comparison to learning with a traditional hands-on laboratory approach. My expectations were that <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> would be advantageous to ELLs, regardless of the individual learners' language proficiency levels. I expected that a comparison ELL group engaged in hands-on laboratory experiments would not perform as well as learners in the <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> group. A total of 44 ELL students were randomly assigned to two treatment groups (<b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> group, n = 22; traditional laboratory group, n = 22). Within each treatment group, smaller groups of 3 to 4 students were randomly assigned to work together, resulting in 7 smaller <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> groups and 7 smaller traditional hands-on laboratory groups (Appendix D). Attrition resulted in a total of 30 students distributed into treatment groups (<b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> group, n = 20; traditional laboratory group, n = 10). Data collected for comparison included two measures of conceptual understanding. Gain scores were calculated for pre- and posttest FCI questions. Student journal entries and videotaped speech transcriptions were analyzed and transformed into quantitative frequencies and percentages. Results confirmed simulations assisted ELLs in grasping concepts but didn?t support simulations as encouraging conceptual conversation. Results indicated that ELLs learning with simulations were not at a disadvantage in understanding concepts even though they discussed and made fewer journal entries than ELLs learning with traditional hands-on approach. Exploratory in nature, this comparative study was the first of its kind to explore ELLs? conceptual understanding comparing <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> and hands-on instructional approaches. The results of this study lead to recommendations for a more extensive examination of ELLs' use of <b>computer</b> <b>simulations</b> to reinforce ELLs' learning of abstract physics concepts. However, several implications for classroom practices emerged from the findings of this exploratory study. Implications, which are discussed in the final section of the dissertation, include classroom practices related to misconceptions, scaffolding, assisting learners in grasping abstract concepts, and reinforcing conceptual understanding...|$|R
