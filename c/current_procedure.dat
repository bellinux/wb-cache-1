25|$|Regular weekend direct, cross-strait charter flights between {{mainland}} China and Taiwan resumed on July 4, 2008 for {{the first}} time since 1950. Liu Shaoyong, China Southern Airlines chair, piloted the first flight from Guangzhou to Taipei. Simultaneously, a Taiwan-based China Airlines flight flew to Shanghai. Currently, 61 mainland Chinese cities are connected with eight airports in Taiwan. The flights operate every day, totaling 890 round-trip flights across the Taiwan Strait per week. Previously, regular passengers (other than festive or emergency charters) had to make a time-consuming stopover at a third destination, usually Hong Kong. Under the <b>current</b> <b>procedure,</b> the flights do not directly cross the Taiwan Strait for security reasons, but instead must enter the Hong Kong air control area before moving into or out of China or Taiwan airspace.|$|E
2500|$|Power of pardon: The President, on {{the advice}} of the Government, has [...] "the right of pardon and the power to commute or remit punishment". [...] Pardon, for miscarriages of justice, has applied rarely: Thomas Quinn in 1940, Brady in 1943, and Nicky Kelly in 1992. The <b>current</b> <b>procedure</b> is {{specified}} by Section 7 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1993. There were plans in 2005 for paramilitary [...] "on the runs" [...] to receive pardons as part of the Northern Ireland peace process, to supplement the 1998 early release of serving prisoners after the Good Friday Agreement. This was controversial and was soon abandoned along with similar British proposals. Power of commutation and remittance are not restricted to the President, though this was the case for death sentences handed down prior to the abolition of capital punishment.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Current</b> <b>procedure</b> for {{analysing}} tides {{follows the}} method of harmonic analysis introduced in the 1860s by William Thomson. It {{is based on the}} principle that the astronomical theories of the motions of sun and moon determine a large number of component frequencies, and at each frequency there is a component of force tending to produce tidal motion, but that at each place of interest on the Earth, the tides respond at each frequency with an amplitude and phase peculiar to that locality. [...] At each place of interest, the tide heights are therefore measured {{for a period of time}} sufficiently long (usually more than a year in the case of a new port not previously studied) to enable the response at each significant tide-generating frequency to be distinguished by analysis, and to extract the tidal constants for a sufficient number of the strongest known components of the astronomical tidal forces to enable practical tide prediction. The tide heights are expected to follow the tidal force, with a constant amplitude and phase delay for each component. [...] Because astronomical frequencies and phases can be calculated with certainty, the tide height at other times can then be predicted once the response to the harmonic components of the astronomical tide-generating forces has been found.|$|E

2500|$|The laws of Obediencia debida ("Due Obedience") and Punto Final ("Stop") {{known as}} the laws of {{impunity}} were annulled by the Supreme Court on June 14, 2005 using the concept of crimes against humanity, after on April 19, 2005 the Third Chamber of the Spanish National Court sentenced the naval officer, Adolfo Scilingo, for crimes against humanity, which was confirmed by the Spanish Supreme Court on October 1, 2007. The principle used by the sentence was ratified by the European Court of Human Rights in the case Petr Kislyiy against Estonia on January 17, 2006 and Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruling in the Case of Almonacid on September 26, 2006. The fact that these statements recognize the application of this concept of international law in ordinary courts is a milestone {{in the history of}} international human rights. This situation led to the opening of some trials in Cordoba, Corrientes, Tucumán and Buenos Aires and there are several on the procedural schedule. Sentences confirmed the implementation of the concept of [...] "crimes against humanity", but investigations were not adequate to international law, or have joined the investigation and prosecution procedures as consistent with the types of crimes arising from international criminal law. This affects, using ordinary criminal law standards, the type of testing needed and who may be charged.

5000|$|By comparison, the Sun Microsystems SPARC {{architecture}} provides simultaneous visibility {{into four}} sets of eight registers each. Three sets of eight registers each are [...] "windowed". Eight registers (i0 through i7) form the input registers to the <b>current</b> <b>procedure</b> level. Eight registers (L0 through L7) are local to the <b>current</b> <b>procedure</b> level, and eight registers (o0 through o7) are the outputs from the <b>current</b> <b>procedure</b> level {{to the next level}} called. When a procedure is called, the register window shifts by sixteen registers, hiding the old input registers and old local registers and making the old output registers the new input registers.The common registers (old output registers and new input registers) are used for parameter passing. Finally, eight registers (g0 through g7) are globally visible to all procedure levels.|$|E

The present study was initiated to develop analytical procedures for adjusting {{estimates of the}} flexural properties of 2 -inch-thick Douglas-fir dimension lumber that would be applicable to {{all levels of the}} flexural properties. Equations are derived for adjusting modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), moment capacity (RS = MOR × section modulus), and flexural stiffness (EI = MOEX moment of inertia) for changes in moisture content.
