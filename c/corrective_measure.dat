Within criminal law, it is used to convey the idea that the punishment of an offender should fit the crime. Under international humanitarian law governing the legal use of force in an armed conflict, proportionality and distinction are important factors in assessing military necessity.|$|E

The jury returned a verdict for Mr. Aldridge in excess of US $1 million. The Texas Twelfth District Court of Appeals upheld the verdict and the spoliation inference instruction. The Texas Supreme Court reversed, ordering a new trial, stating that it was abuse of discretion by the trial court to issue a spoliation inference instruction in this case, that the court should have imposed a different <b>corrective</b> <b>measure</b> on Brookshire Brothers (a less severe sanction), and that a spoliation inference instruction to the jury is only warranted in egregious cases of destruction of relevant evidence.|$|E
50|$|Single, young, male laborers were {{initially}} {{the largest group}} using chain migration to the United States in the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries. However, each immigrant group maintained a unique composition due to circumstances in home countries, goals of migration, and American immigration laws. For example, Irish migration after 1880 had a 53.6% female majority, the only migrant group with that distinction. Irish men and women faced economic crisis, overpopulation, and problematic inheritance laws for large families, thereby compelling many of Ireland’s daughters to leave with her sons. Italian chain migration was initially wholly male based on intent to return, but became a source of family reunification when wives eventually immigrated. Chinese chain migration was almost exclusively male until 1946, when the Chinese War Brides Act allowed Chinese wives of American citizens to immigrate without regards to Chinese immigration quotas. Before that time, chain migration was limited to “paper sons” and actual sons from China. The imbalanced sex ratio of Chinese immigrants was due to Chinese exclusion laws and the inability to bring current wives or to marry and return to the United States, inhibiting the <b>corrective</b> <b>measure</b> of chain migration. When immigrant groups react to economic pull factors in the labor markets, chain migration via family has been used informally to balance out the gender ratio in ethnic immigrant communities.|$|E
5000|$|The largely apolitical Truman Committee is {{also known}} for setting a high {{standard}} of practicality and neutrality in congressional investigative committees. Observers have occasionally compared the situation faced by the Truman Committee in the early 1940s with later political and military issues. In January 2005 {{in the face of}} an additional $80-100 billion requested by President George W. Bush to increase the Iraq War, columnist Arianna Huffington recommended that the resolution sponsored by Senators Larry Craig and Dick Durbin be passed to create a bipartisan oversight committee [...] "modeled on the one Harry Truman created during WW II to root out war profiteering." [...] The next month, Huffington said [...] "it's a good time to open a history book" [...] to learn about how a Truman-style committee might be used to counter the Iraq War's US-based problems with [...] "waste, fraud, ineptitude, cronyism, secret no-bid contracts, and profiteering cloaked in patriotism." [...] Huffington's endorsement came three months after a press release by Taxpayers for Common Sense titled [...] "Bring Back the Truman Committee" [...] in which Truman's record of stopping war profiteering in the 1940s was said to be [...] "the most famous and the most successful" [...] example, a model needed as a <b>corrective</b> <b>measure</b> to stem US military contractor improprieties in the War on Terror. The problem was still not solved by 2007 when Senator Charles Schumer wrote, [...] "The lesson of the Truman Committee is sorely in need of learning today". He described how Republican Representatives blocked [...] "for more than a year" [...] a bipartisan proposal for an investigative committee to look into military [...] "scandals and abuses" [...] in Iraq. When Senators Jim Webb of Virginia and Claire McCaskill of Missouri - who held the same Senate seat as Truman did - formed a Truman-type committee in January 2008, the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, President Bush said it was [...] "a threat to national security." ...|$|E

50|$|Hailed {{variously}} as ‘monarch of wit and satire’, ‘incarnation of humour’ and the ‘Vidyapati of Maithili Prose’, Prof. Hari Mohan Jha {{made his}} {{appearance on the}} Maithili literary scene as a miracle which holds its spell even today. Laurels of praise though these sobriquets might be, they have a circumscribing and delimiting impact on his multi-faceted genius. To brand him as a satirist who is generally believed to be inferior in merit and destructive in intent amounts to a denial of his talent as a creative artist. To call him a wit is, of course, an admiration for his intellectual sharpness and cerebral brilliance, but it also points to, by implication, a lack of emotional elements in his writings. By confining him to humour we tend to become unresponsive to his equal deftness in handling other human emotions, especially pathos. And the great prose-stylist, we should bear in mind, was also a versifier of considerable merit. By profession a philosopher, generally notorious for his absent-mindedness, he was gifted with a rare agility of mind which expressed itself through a ready wit, bright and sparkling irony and quick repartee that enliven all his writings. In life a Professor of Philosophy known for seriousness, he is perhaps the greatest humorist in letters. The kind of humour he is famous for has no parallel in world literature: not even Bernard Shaw, G.K. Chesterton, Hilaire Belloc, Mark Twain, Evelyn Waugh or P.G. Wodehouse could ever come quite close to it. It is the inimitable native humour of Mithila which tickles as it pinches or stings, and ranges from a simple chuckle, giggle or smile to a full-throated guffaw or an uproarious laughter that {{has the capacity to}} bring the roof down. It is also surprising that a philosopher who dwells primarily in a world of abstractions could be so concrete in the delineation of plot, character and incident. But the logician and the literary artist seem to unite in the ‘tough reasonableness” of his arguments moving as an undercurrent beneath the surface of his humour. His humour is not just an intellectual luxury but a <b>corrective</b> <b>measure</b> aimed at exposing shams, stripping naked the follies of the time, or pricking the bubbles of pretension. His humour has much more therapeutic effect than the present-day laughing clubs. Like Bernard Shaw he believed in art for life’s sake, and made his writing purposeful. To him literature was a platform whence he could air his radical, iconoclastic views to correct the evils eating into the vitals of the socio-cultural complex of Mithila. The message is sometimes overtly stated; sometimes it is artistically woven into the plot.|$|E
