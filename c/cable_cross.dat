5000|$|To {{maximize}} the usable excess strength {{for a given}} amount of cable material, the cable's cross section area {{would need to be}} designed for the most part {{in such a way that}} the stress (i.e., the tension per unit of cross sectional area) is constant along the length of the cable. [...] The constant-stress criterion is a starting point in the design of the <b>cable</b> <b>cross</b> section as it changes with altitude. Other factors considered in more detailed designs include thickening at altitudes where more space junk is present, consideration of the point stresses imposed by climbers, and the use of varied materials. [...] To account for these and other factors, modern detailed cross section designs seek to achieve the largest safety margin possible, with as little variation over altitude and time as possible. [...] In simple starting-point designs, that equates to constant-stress.|$|E

40|$|Trusses {{used for}} roof support in coal mines are {{constructed}} of two grouted bolts installed at opposing forty-five degree angles into {{the roof and}} a cross member that ties the angled bolts together. The load on the cross member is vertical, which is transverse to the longitudinal axis, and therefore the cross member is loaded in the weakest direction. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the vertical load capacity and deflection of three different types of cross members. Single-point load tests, with the load applied {{in the center of}} the specimen and double-point load tests, with a span of 2. 4 m, were conducted. For the single-point load configuration, the yield of the 25 mm solid bar cross member was nominally 98 kN of vertical load, achieved at 42 cm of deflection. For <b>cable</b> <b>cross</b> members, yield was not achieved even after 45 cm of deflection. Peak vertical loads were about 89 kN for 17 mm cables and 67 kN for the 15 mm cables. For the double-point load configurations, the 25 mm solid bar cross members yielded at 150 kN of vertical load and 25 cm of deflection. At 25 cm of deflection individual cable strands started breaking at 133 and 111 kN of vertical load for the 17 and 15 mm <b>cable</b> <b>cross</b> members respectively.

40|$|We have {{performed}} experiments and simulations {{of the current}} distribution process in a CICC with the aim to understand better the coupled thermal, hydraulic and electric process {{that leads to a}} stable or unstable transient cable behaviour. The cable, wound from 128 Nb 3 Sn and pure copper strands, has been tested in the SULTAN facility. A resistive heater, glued on the jacket of the conductor, has been used to start the transient, and the response has been monitored with arrays of Hall plates. In this paper we report the results of simulations, especially the computed Hall signals, and compare them to the experimental data.

40|$|A charge {{simulation}} method {{is used to}} calculate the stress distribution in a three core belted power cable having circular conductors. Each conductor is represented by N//c infinite line charges arranged in a circular pattern inside the conductor. The sheath is represented by N//s infinite line charges arranged in a circular pattern outside the sheath. Values of N//c and N//s are selected so that the percentage potential error is below 1 % even when interconductor spacing is small. The variation of stress with location, time and cable parameters is studied in the entire <b>cable</b> <b>cross</b> section. The locations of maximum stress points are determined and magnitudes of these stresses are calculated using typical cable design parameters.

Question by reactive power generation are of great importance, {{as the need for}} it is increasing due to extensive use of power consumers with sufficiently low power factor. Reactive power balance should be ensured in all operating modes of power supply system: normal, after the emergency, repair. When the post-accident and repair modes use all the means for generating reactive power, regardless of their efficiency. Compensating devices are also used as a means of regulating the voltage to ensure optimum voltages in electrical networks. ????????? ??????-??????????? ????????? ??????????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ????????? ?????: ? ??????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ? ?????? ??????? ??? ???????, ? ???????? ?????????? ? ????????? ???????????? ????????????? ????? ???????, ????????? ????????? ?????????????????? ? ??????????????? ???????????? ????? ??????? ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ????? ???????? ????????????. ??????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????? ????? ??????? ????????, ??? ??? ??????????? ? ??? ?????????? ? ????? ? ??????? ??????????? ????????????????? ? ?????????? ?????? ????????????? ????????. ?????? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????????? ??? ???? ??????? ?????? ??????? ????????????????: ??????????, ??????????????, ?????????. ??? ?????????????? ? ????????? ??????? ???????????? ??? ???????? ????????? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ?? ?? ?????????????. ?????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ????? ? ???????? ?????? ?? ??????? ????????????? ?????????? ? ????? ??????????? ???????????? ?????? ?????????? ? ????????????? ?????...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss results of a {{one-dimensional}} numerical model to simulate electrical and thermal transients in the superconducting cables for the LHC machine, with specific reference {{to the analysis of}} quench due to the heat released by beam losses. Two models have been developed, one based on the analysis of the behavior of a single strand, whereas the other accounts for all the strands in the multi-strand cable. As a first step the stability margin is computed considering the single strand subjected to a variable magnetic field and heat deposit along its length. The impact of the field non-uniformity is assessed by comparison with computations performed assuming a uniform field in the <b>cable</b> <b>cross</b> section. The results of this model are compared to those obtained with the multi-strand model. The numerical results are discussed in terms of current and heat redistribution between strands, and stability margin of the cable...|$|E
40|$|Rutherford-type cables {{are used}} in superconducting {{accelerator}} magnets. To produce magnetic fields larger than 10 T, brittle superconductors like Nb 3 Sn are typically used. The original round wire, {{in the form of}} a composite of Copper, Niobium and Tin, is assembled into a so-called Rutherford-type cable, which is used to wind the magnet. The magnet is then subjected to a high temperature heat treatment to produce the chemical reactions that make the material superconducting. At this stage the superconductor is brittle and its superconducting properties sensitive to strain. This work describes a 2 D finite element model, which simulates the mechanical behavior of Rutherford-type cable before heat treatment.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{innovative}} software-based planning approach for large-scale ground-mounted photovoltaic power plants which helps planners to design better layouts in shorter time. Rather than improving one single layout in a trial-and-error manner, the software generates {{a variety of}} layout variants according to the planners’ specifications. By comparing both technical and financial characteristics as, e. g. tilt angle, installed power, energy yield, costs, NPV, IRR, LCoE, planners understand the effects of design changes and find the layout which fits their needs best. Due to automation routines, e. g. for <b>cable</b> <b>cross</b> section calculations and CAD export of plant layouts, the engineering effort for bid preparations is 80 % lower compared to manual layout planning procedures with CAD and Excel. Benchmarking studies as well as project application showed that up to 10 % lower energy generation costs can be attained with this planning approach.

Using X-ray absorption tomography we have determined the 3 D {{shape of an}} unreacted Nb 3 Sn 11 T dipole Rutherford cable, and of a reacted and impregnated Nb 3 Sn cable double stack. State-of-the-art image processing was applied to correct for tomographic artefacts caused by the large cable aspect ratio, for the segmentation of the individual wires and subelement bundles inside the wires, and for the calculation of the wire cross sectional area and shape variations. The 11 T dipole <b>cable</b> <b>cross</b> section oscillates by 2 % with a frequency of 1. 24 mm (1 / 80 of the transposition pitch length of the 40 wire cable).

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{development of}} large-scale offshore wind farms {{around the world}} has caused many new technical and economic challenges to emerge. The capital cost of the electrical network that supports a large offshore wind farm constitutes {{a significant proportion of}} the total cost of the wind farm.

A cost model has been developed that includes a more realistic treatment of the cost of transformers, transformer substations, and cables. These improvements make this cost model more detailed than others that are currently in use. A novel solution algorithm is used. This algorithm is based on an improved genetic algorithm and includes a specific algorithm that considers different <b>cable</b> <b>cross</b> sections when designing the radial arrays. The proposed approach is tested with a large offshore wind farm; this testing has shown that the proposed algorithm produces valid optimal electrical network designs...|$|E

A procedure, based on the comparison between the model eigenfrequencies and frequency measures obtained from the experimental dynamic response of in service cables, is used to identify the damage parameters. Its efficiency is successfully verified on pseudo-experimental dat...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe EuroCirCol {{collaboration}} is designing a 16  T Nb 3 Sn dipole {{that can be}} used as the main bending magnet in a 100  km long 100  TeV hadron-hadron collider. For economic reasons, the magnets need to be as compact as possible, requiring optimization of the <b>cable</b> <b>cross</b> section in different magnetic field regions. This leads to very high stored energy density and poses serious challenges for the magnet protection in case of a quench, i. e., sudden loss of superconductivity in the winding. The magnet design therefore must account for the limitations set by quench protection from the earliest stages of the design. In this paper we describe how the aspect of quench protection has been accounted for {{in the process of developing}} different options for the 16  T dipole designs. We discuss the assumed safe values for hot spot temperatures and voltages, and the efficiency of the protection system. We describe the developed tools for the quench analysis, and how their usage in the magnet design will eventually ensure a secure magnet operation...|$|E
