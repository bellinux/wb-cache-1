40|$|The <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid,</b> Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch) (Homoptera: Aphididae), is an {{occasional}} pest of maize, Zea mays L. <b>Corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> damage in maize {{has been characterized}} in whorl-stage plants, but seedling damage has not been investigated. Resistance mechanisms in maize to corn leaf aphids are not well understood. The objectives of these studies were to determine the role of DIMBOA (2, 4 -dihydroxy- 7 -methoxyl- 1, 4 -benzoxazin- 3 -one) in maize resistance to corn leaf aphids, to document <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> feeding damage on seedling maize, and to characterize feeding behavior differences on seedling and whorl-stage maize;Inbred 41 : 2504 B (high DIMBOA) was colonized by corn leaf aphids immediately upon seedling emergence. Inbreds B 73 and B 37 (low DIMBOA) were colonized in the three- and six-leaf stages, respectively. Inbreds C 103 and Mo 17 (low DIMBOA) were colonized in the six- and seven-leaf stages, respectively. Regression and partial correlation analysis showed no relationship between <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> colonization and DIMBOA. These data indicate that DIMBOA is not a primary resistance factor in maize to corn leaf aphids;Corn leaf aphid feeding on coleoptile and two-leaf stage maize plants reduced plant height and delayed pollen shedding and silking. Grain fill was reduced when aphids fed on coleoptile, two-leaf, and four-leaf stage maize. Grain fill reductions occurred on inbreds B 37, C 103, and 41 : 2504 B, but not on B 73 and Mo 17. <b>Corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> damage on seedling maize resulted in yield reductions;Examination of late-whorl stage and seedling maize indicated that 57 % of the <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> stylet tracks penetrated late-whorl stage plants through stomata. Eighty-six percent of stylet penetrations in seedling maize occurred intercellularly between epidermal cells and 8 % through the stomata. Fifty-seven percent and 79 % of the stylet tracks terminated in phloem in whorl-stage and seedling maize, respectively. Aphid damaged stomata may be important in explaining yield reductions in heavily infested water stressed maize;These findings indicate that corn leaf aphids were capable of feeding on and damaging seedling maize, and that resistance mechanisms in maize to the <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> do not involve the secondary plant chemical DIMBOA...|$|E

At 35 degrees C, only a few nymphs survived and completed development, but all failed to reproduce. Total immature stages from birth to adult decreased as temperature increased from 51. 7 d at 6 degrees C to 5. 2 d at 30 degrees C, but became 8. 0 d at 35 degrees C. Overall immature development required 119. 05 degree-days above 4. 44 degrees C. Adult longevity was as high as 26. 7 d at 15 degrees C, but significantly declined at 30 and 35 degrees C. The average adult fecundity was as high as 45 offspring at 15 and 20 degrees C, but dropped to 1. 8 at 6 degrees C and 8. 6 at 30 degrees C. In general, as temperatures increased, age-specific survivorship (I-x) declined more quickly, but age-specific fecundity (m(x)) peaked earlier.

40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} studies {{were carried out}} for four years (1989 - 93) on varietal resistance of wheat aphids. Aphids phenology studies indicated that four aphid species were found colonizing wheat during course of study. The aphid species were, greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid,</b> Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch), rice root aphid Rhopalosiphum rufiabdominals (Sasaki) and rusty plum aphid Hvsteroneura setariae, (Thomas). All aphids appeared on the crop in the month of January. There was positive correlation of population growth of greenbug with crop age. Studies on population growth of greenbug on 10 wheat cultivars under field conditions revealed that mean seasonal population per 5 tillers were highest on Kohinoor (47. 6) followed by ZA- 77 (46. 3), Mehran- 89 (44. 4), Lira (41. 4), Pavan (40. 0), Blue silver (39. 4), TJ- 83 (36. 6), Pak- 70 (30. 9), Sarsabz (21. 8) and Anmol (18. 9). Regression equations on population buildup of greenbug in different cultivars showed that reproduction rate was highest in Blue silver (0. 129) followed by Mehran- 89 (0. 124), lira (0. 097), Anmol (0. 085) and Sarsabz (0. 081). Laboratory studies on life tables parameters of green bug on three varieties, viz Kohinoor Sarsabz and Mehran- 89 indicated that numbe 2 of days to reproduction (x 2) = 0. 8) mean generation time (T) (x 2) = 0. 11) on three wheat cultivars were non-significant different. The longevity (x = 5. 18), total off springs (x 2 = 14. 36) and innate capacity of increase (r) (x 2 = 6. 04) were significantly different. The adult longevity was highest on Mehran- 89 (41) followed by Kohinoor (31) and Sarsabz (22). The total number of off springs per female was lowest on sarsabz (2. 37) and highest in Mehran- 89 (23. 49). The innate capacity of increase value was lowest for Sarsabz (0. 062) and highest for Mehran- 89 (0. 132). The mortality value (qx) on all varieties was high initially and later decreased gradually. Within plant distribution of aphids results showed that greenbug Schizaphis raminum (Rondani) was found predominant among cereal aphid on wheat in Sindh. Percent vertical distribution was 4. 673 % on leaf 1 (top most leaf), 10. 403 % on leaf 2, 17. 09 % on leaf 3, 28. 36 % on leaf 4, and 39. 43 % on leaf 5 (bottom leaf). The top most leaf had minimum aphid numbers where as bottom leaf harbored maximum aphids. Results on spatial distribution of aphids on wheat indicated that the index of dispersion was > 1 for both greenbug and <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> and was less aggregated at low density levels. The over all average values for clumping (K) were higher (0. 212) for greenbug and lowest (0. 0315) for <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid.</b> Lloyd's crowing index was positively correlated with population mean for greenbug. In case of <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> slope of line was steep (4. 539). Parameters from regression of In (mean density) on In (-In Po) men also used to develop functional relationship between mean density and proportion of empty sample units. Field comparison of horizontal water-pan traps of four different colours with each other, and with suction trap were done in winter 1991 to assess their effectiveness in measuring -the landing rates of aphids on wheat. Aphids were monitored at weekly interval. four species namely, greenbug (Schizaphis raminum Rond.), <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> (Rhopalosiphum maidis Fitch), rice root aphid (rufiabdominalis) and rusty plum aphid (Hysteroneura setariae Thomas) were collected. maidis was predominantly attracted towards yellow pan traps whereas raminum catches were maximum on suction trap. Yellow pan traps attracted the greatest number of aphids and met the criteria for the ideal trap. The level of aphid catch per unit of surface area decreased with the increased size of a trap. The effect of different rates of fertilizers and irrigations schedules on greenbug population indicated that fertilizer treatments increased greenbug population. The F-values showed significant difference in greenbug population for fertilizer treatments for all varieties except Sarsabz. Greenbug populations were high at 21 days interval irrigatior. schedule. Aphid predation studies indicated that 4 species of predators were found on wheat crop viz., Coccinella septempunctata Linn., Coccinella undecimpunctata, Chrysopa'§"p". and Syrphus'§"p". Among predators Coccinella septempunctata was most predominant Chrysopa and Syrphus sp. were recorded during early stage of crop whereas coccinella septempunctata and Coccinella undecimpunctata were present throughout the wheat season. Laboratory studies on efficacy of coccinella septempunctata showed that, one adult beetle consumed 83. 7 aphids per day and is potential predator to suppress aphid population below economic threshold in wheat agro-ecosystem. Varietal resistance studies on 22 cultivars and 6 allied cultivars of wheat indicated that among allied cultivars Triticum monococcum had maximum infestation of 2. 569 aphids per tiller. Triticum durum was highly protected cultivar against aphid attack. The F-statistic for black aphid was 110. 44 and at 0. 05 level 7 groups of susceptibility resistance were obtained through LSD. The highly resistant cultivar was M- 233. the F-statistic for <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> was 124. 04 and 8 group of cultivars were found with LSD test and M- 233 found most resistant cultivar. The F-statistic for greenbug was 200. 93. The most resistant variety was M- 233. The regression equation gave negative but non-significant correlation between total amino acid content and black aphid or <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid.</b> The regression equation showed positive relationship between total amino acids content and greenbug population with significant r-value (0. 60) step wise regression models showed negative correlation between <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> at with methionine.

40|$|Generalist predators {{are common}} in most {{agricultural}} cropping systems. However, pest control from these predators is often overlooked {{as a component of}} integrated pest management (IPM) because the extent of predation is generally unknown and difficult to assess. In western New York sweet corn (Zea mays L.), the primary predators are Orius insidiosus (Say), Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer), and Harmonia axyridis (Pallas). European corn borer [Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner) ] is the primary insect pest. The objectives of this study were to compare O. nubilalis egg predation rates for these three species and to understand how egg predation by these predators is affected by the availability of alternative food. Laboratory data indicate that all three predators feed on O. nubilalis eggs. C. maculata consumed more eggs than H. axyridis or O. insidiosus. Immatures of C. maculata and O. insidiosus readily completed development on a diet of O. nubilalis eggs, but H. axyridis larvae could not complete development on this diet. The presence of <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphids</b> [Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch) ] and corn pollen reduced egg predation per insect for some stage of all species. The reduction in O. nubilalis egg predation associated with the presence of aphids was confirmed in field cage studies and was similar among the coccinellid populations tested. Field studies comparing aphids, predator populations, and O. nubilalis egg predation show that reduced egg predation per insect more than offsets the higher populations encountered when aphids and pollen are numerous, resulting in less biological control of O. nubilalis when alternative foods are availabl...|$|R
40|$|Induced {{resistance}} {{has been}} defined as the 2 ̆ 2 qualitative or quantitative enhancement of a plant 2 ̆ 7 s defense mechanisms against pests in response to extrinsic physical or chemical stimuli. 2 ̆ 2 (Kogan and Paxton, 1983). Physical stimuli can include infection by a pathogenic organism (Jorgensen et al, 1996; Morris et al, 1998) and feeding by insects (Felton and Eichenseer, 1999). Chemical stimuli include such organic compounds as salicylic acid (Hammerschmidt and Smith-Becker, 1999), jasmonic acid (Staswick and Lehman, 1999), and the commercially available Actigard® 50 WG (Tally et al., 1999) (Syngenta Crop Protection, P. O. Box 18300, Greensboro, NC 27419). Actigard® 50 WG is registered in the U. S. to protect tomatoes, spinach and tobacco from fungal and bacterial pathogens. Srinivas et al. (2001 a) showed that Actigard® did induce resistance in soybean to adult feeding of the bean leaf beetle, Cerotoma trifurcata (Forster) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). However, Inbar et al. (2001) concluded that the active ingredient (i. e., BTH) in Actigard® had a negligible effect on whiteflies, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae) and the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), in cotton. Documentation of induced resistance against insect herbivores has a relatively short history (Karban and Kuc, 1999). The direct effects of induced resistance against insect herbivores have been shown in tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum Miller (Solanaceae) (Thaler, 1999), cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. (Malvaceae) (Karban and Carey, 1984), soybean, Glycine max (L.) (Leguminosae) (Lin et al., 1990), {{and a number of other}} crops (Karban and Baldwin, 1997). A few studies have been published documenting an induced response in maize, Zea mays L. (Graminae), to fungal pathogens such as Helminthosporium carbonum (Ullstrup) and Puccinia sorghi (Schw.) (Cantone and Dunkle, 1990; Morris et al., 1998). Morse et al. (1991) showed that mechanical crushing damage to maize leaves similar to that of certain insects with chewing mouthparts did result in reduced aphid growth rates and dramatically lower <b>aphid</b> survival when <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphids</b> fed on the plants subsequent to the initial mechanical damage. Turlings et al. (1993, 1995, 1998) conducted several studies on maize and showed a response to herbivore feeding that attracted parasitoids to the plant in its defense. The studies reported here were conducted to determine if an induction response can be shown in maize to fall armyworm larvae during the seedling to early vegetative growth stages as a response to initial feeding by the fall armyworm and/or treatment by the chemical inducer Actigard® 50 WG...|$|R

In addition, by comparing its functional parameters, we found that L. axyridis’ ability to control A. glycines is significantly stronger than that of R. maidis. Originating text in Chinese.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} genetics of <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> (CLA) resistance in barley under controlled conditions with artificial inoculation at adult plant stage. Inheritance of CLA resistance was investigated in five resistant barley genotypes (EB 921, EB 2507, Manjula, DL 529 and K 144) in crosses with susceptible parent Alfa 93 in F 1, F 2, F 3 and backcross (BCF 1) generations. The aphid inoculation was done using the brush method {{as well as the}} detached leaf method. Individual plants were classified in resistant, moderately resistant, susceptible and highly susceptible categories base on number per shoot as well as multiplication of CLA on any of the fresh, young leaf. The plants scored as resistant or moderately resistant were observed twice more at 10 days interval to confirm their reaction. Resistance was governed by a single dominant gene in EB 921, DL 529 and K 144, while it was monogenic recessive in Manjula and EB 2507. These diverse sources may be used in breeding for CLA resistance in barley improvement programme...|$|E
40|$|The {{vasculature}} {{of plants}} {{act as a}} channel for transport of signal(s) that facilitate long-distance intraplant communication. In maize, Maize insect resistance 1 -Cysteine Protease (Mir 1 -CP), which has homology to papain-like proteases, provides defense to different feeding guilds of insect pests. Furthermore, accumulation of Mir 1 -CP in the vasculature suggests that Mir 1 -CP can potentially function as a phloemmobile protein. In a recent study, we provided evidence that Mir 1 -CP can curtail the growth of phloemsap sucking insect, <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> (CLA; Rhopalosiphum maidis). Our current study further examined whether aboveground feeding by CLA can induce resistance to subsequent herbivory by belowground feeding western corn rootworm (WCR; Diabrotica virgifera virgifera). Aboveground feeding by CLA systemically induced the accumulation of Mir 1 -CP in the roots. Furthermore, foliage feeding by CLA provided enhanced resistance to subsequent herbivory by below ground feeding of WCR. Taken together, our previous findings and results presented here indicate that long-distance transport of Mir 1 -CP is critical for providing enhanced resistance to insect attack in maize...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to produce <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> and field grass to be biscuit form as a commercial feed ruminant and was to evaluate biscuit feeding of <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> and field grass for feed intake, body weight gain and feed efficiency of sheep. This research divided in two phases, i. e. production of Corn Plant Waste Biscuit and productivity feed biscuit technology in field scale (MT Farm Ciampea) on April-November 2010. Experimental diets for the second phase used Completely Randomized Design with 3 treatments dan 3 replications were T 1 = biscuit (100 % field grass); T 2 = biscuit (50 % field grass + 50 % corn leaf); T 3 = biscuit (100 % <b>corn</b> <b>leaf).</b> The second phase of experimental used the best biscuits treatment in the first phase. The average of biscuit machine production capacity was 8. 6 kg/h with the production cost of Rp 1072,-/kg. The results showed that biscuit of <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> 100 % had best nutrient quality with crude protein 17. 97 %, crude fiber 28. 20 %, crude fat 1. 09 % and BETN 40. 99 %. Mean while, physic quality test showed that water content was 13. 10 %, water activity was 0. 866 %, density was 0. 529 g/ cm 3, and water absorption capacity was 78. 58 %. Productivity test on sheep fed field grass and <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> biscuit showed that nutrient quality analysis showed that best quality was corn leaves biscuit with Corn leaves biscuit fed has significant efficiency on dry matter intake (P< 0. 05) with was the highest value (263. 18 g/head/day). The average of body weight gain of sheep fed with <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> biscuit was 61. 90 g/head/day or 44. 60 % higher than sheep fed with field grass.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to (1) evaluate the nitrogen status of the <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> as an indicator of the nitrogen supplying capacity of the soil, and to (2) study the relationship of phosphorus content of the <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> to the <b>corn</b> yields on the different corn producing soils of Nebraska. Except in the Cuming County experiment, phosphorus was not a limiting factor in the production of corn. Increases in yields of corn in most of the experiments could be attributed solely to the application of nitrogen fertilizer. The relation of nitrogen percentage in the sixth <b>corn</b> <b>leaf</b> at silking time or bloom stage to corn yield was used for determining the nitrogen supplying capacity of the soil in eight corn fertilizer experiments on several major soil types during 1949 and 1950.
