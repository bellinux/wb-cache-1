40|$|The {{apparent}} {{position of}} speech and music sound sources was investigated using both a two <b>channel</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> array and a three <b>channel</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> array. The results showed that a sine-cosine pan law was reasonably accurate for the three channel array, but consistently produced sharp images who's positions were consistently wider than expected with a two channel array. The discrepancy was investigated using a headphone model. We found the apparent position depends strongly on the spectrum of the source, with speech frequencies tending to dominate the overall impression...|$|R

50|$|<b>Center</b> <b>channel</b> {{refers to}} an audio channel common to many {{surround}} sound formats. It is the channel that is mostly, or fully, dedicated to the reproduction of the dialogue of an audiovisual program. The speaker(s) connected to the <b>center</b> <b>channel</b> are placed {{in the center of}} and behind the perforated projection screen, to give the effect that sounds from the <b>center</b> <b>channel</b> are coming from the screen.

50|$|The {{function}} of the <b>center</b> <b>channel</b> is to anchor the signal so that any central panned images do not shift when a listener is moving or is sitting away from the sweet spot. The <b>center</b> <b>channel</b> also prevents any timbral modifications from occurring, which is typical for 2-channel stereo, due to phase differences at the two ears of a listener. The centre channel is especially used in films and television, with dialogue primarily feeding the <b>center</b> <b>channel.</b> The {{function of}} the <b>center</b> <b>channel</b> can either be of a monophonic nature (as with dialogue) {{or it can be}} used in combination with the left and right channels for true three-channel stereo. Motion Pictures tend to use the <b>center</b> <b>channel</b> for monophonic purposes with stereo being reserved purely for the left and right channels. Surround microphones techniques have however been developed that fully use the potential of three-channel stereo.|$|R

40|$|Two- to three-channel audio upmix can {{be useful}} in a number of contexts. Adding a front center {{loudspeaker}} provides a more stable center image and an increase in dialogue clarity. Even {{in the absence of a}} physical center speaker, the ability to derive a <b>center</b> <b>channel</b> can facilitate speech enhancement by making it possible to boost or filter the dialogue, which is usually panned to the center. Two- to three-channel upmix can also be a first step in upmixing from two to five channels. We propose a frequency-domain upmix process using a vector-based signal decomposition, including methods for improving the selectivity of the <b>center</b> <b>channel</b> extraction. A geometric interpretation of the algorithm is provided. Unlike most existing frequency-domain upmix methods, the current algorithm does not perform an explicit primary/ambient decomposition.

40|$|Abstract [...] - In many speech {{communication}} systems, {{the presence}} of the background interference causes the quality or intelligibility degraded. Noisy environment also reduces listener’s ability to understand what is said. In addition to interpersonal communication, speech can also be transmitted across telephone <b>channels,</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> or headphones. The Quality of speech can also be influenced in data conversion, transmission or reproduction. The goal of speech enhancement method is to reduce background noise, or suppress channel interface or speaker interface {{to improve the quality of}} the speech. The goal of our work is to improve overall speech quality by increasing the intelligibility and reducing background noise. We used a band pass filter to filter out the unwanted noise which is followed by a post spectral subtraction filter. The performance is checked using signal to noise ratio...|$|R

In this paper, visualization studies were performed to study the multi-channel effect in a silicon triple-channel condenser with an aspect ratio of 0. 04. Saturated water vapor was pumped into the microcondenser, which was horizontally positioned. The condenser was cooled by the air natural convention heat transfer in the air environment. Flow patterns are either the annular flow at high inlet vapor pressures, or a quasi-stable elongated bubble at the microchannel upstream followed by a detaching or detached miniature bubble at smaller inlet vapor pressures. The downstream miniature bubble was detached from the elongated bubble tip induced by the maximum Weber number there. It is observed that either a single vapor thread or dual vapor threads are {{at the front of the}} elongated bubble. A miniature bubble is fully formed by breaking up the vapor thread or threads. The transient vapor thread formation and breakup process is exactly symmetry against the centerline of the <b>center</b> <b>channel.</b> In side channels, the Marangoni effect induced by the small temperature variation over the channel width direction causes the vapor thread formation and breakup process deviating from the side channel centerline and approaching the <b>center</b> <b>channel.</b> The Marangoni effect further forces the detached bubble to rotate and approach the <b>center</b> <b>channel,</b> because the <b>center</b> <b>channel</b> always has higher temperatures, indicating the multi-channel effect.  Multi-channel effect {{is important to}} understand transport phenomenon in phase change systems with parallel channels.

40|$|The use of {{surround}} sound in cinema {{can be considered}} fairly ubiquitous today, and with {{that the practice of}} using the <b>center</b> <b>channel</b> for playback of dialogue content. The studies done for dialogue or speech content in the <b>center</b> <b>channel</b> have utilised Speech-in-Noise tests, without placing the test procedure in a realistic application. This study investigated how untrained listeners rated different excerpts of film with accompanying {{surround sound}} in three different playback options for dialogue content: <b>center</b> <b>channel,</b> phantom <b>center</b> and the dialogue positioned in the soundscape according to the actors' positions on screen. The purpose of these ratings was to examine whether one of these three playback options better preserved audio quality in a non-ideal listening position compared to an ideal one. The results show that none of the qualities changed significantly when comparing the two listening positions. The conclusion was made that either the tasks were too complex for untrained subjects or that untrained listeners do not perceive a detriment in audio quality of dialogue when sitting in a non-ideal listening position.

40|$|International audienceSound field {{reproduction}} using Wave Field Synthesis {{has been}} so far limited to the positioning of virtual sources and listeners in the horizontal plane only. These simplifications were originally proposed {{to reduce the number}} of required loudspeakers although the underlying formulation (Kirchhoff-Helmholtz) describes the reproduction of 3 dimensional sound fields in a 3 dimensional subspace. The authors propose here a revised formulation of Wave Field Synthesis in 3 dimensions that limits the number of required loudspeakers, allowing for irregular and incomplete loudspeaker layouts. A source width control parameter is further proposed to reduce localization blur using a virtual source dependent loudspeaker selection criterion. The proposed approach is finally evaluated in an extended listening area. The experiment relies on an elevation localization comparison using individual loudspeakers as targets and 3 D WFS (with or without source width control) as pointer on a 24 <b>channels</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> array that covers the frontal quarter of the upper half of a rectangular room...|$|R
