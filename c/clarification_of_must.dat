40|$|The goal {{to develop}} an {{environmentally}} friendly raw material saving procedure for clarifying filtration of beverages has been achieved with regard to <b>clarification</b> <b>of</b> <b>must</b> and wine. Output data for clarifying filtration of must and wine were determined in filtration trials carried out {{over a period of}} several years. In the first phase of the project it could be confirmed that crossflow plants with filter areas in excess of 100 m" 2 can readily be integrated into the daily production sequence of a 12 -million-litre company. On the basis of the results of phase I a new crossflow module generation was developed in phase II. The work on the one hand focused on the development of a cappillary module with a higher temperature stability and on the other one a flat channel module concept to handle higher solids concentration. The newly developed modules could successfully be employed for the <b>clarification</b> <b>of</b> <b>must,</b> wine and beer. Today the crossflow procedure for the <b>clarification</b> <b>of</b> <b>must</b> and wine can be regarded as economical. On the other hand from an economical point of view a breakthrough of the crossflow technology for the clarification of beer has not yet been achieved. The flux rates obtainable by crossflow filtration of beer elaborated during earlier investigations could be confirmed; they are, however, not yet sufficiently high to replace conventional filtration techniques. According to the present state of knowledge it can be assumed that the crossflow process will succeed in wine and fruit juice processingSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 93 B 1196 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|E
40|$|Grape seed {{extracts}} {{are known}} for their beneficial effects on health and on cardiovascular diseases due to antioxidant activity and the free radical-scaveng-ing properties of proanthocyanidins (PAs). Moreover, grape seed tannins are used in oenology as additives to improve the organoleptic characteristics of wines, and for the <b>clarification</b> <b>of</b> <b>must</b> and wines. PAs in seed extract of 32 hybrid and three V. vinifera grape vari-eties were characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spec-trometry. Signals of 148 compounds were identified as [M+H]+, [M+Na]+ and [M+K]+ adducts of B-type and A-type PAs formed from catechin/epicatechin subunits up to undecamers and with galloylation degree 0 - 7. The number-average molecular weight (M n) of the samples, a parameter correlated with the molecular weight of polymers, and the polyphenolic content of extract, were also determined. Profiles of the hybrid grape varieties were compared with those of three V. vinifera samples studied as references. 'Terzi 108 - 6 ' showed high content of antioxidant polyphenols and 'Seyve Villard 12 - 390 ' higher content of higher oligomers. These two grape varieties are therefore potentially very interesting as sources of antioxidants and tannins for nutraceutical and oenological uses.

30|$|To conclude, we {{demonstrated}} that the lipid content <b>of</b> the <b>must</b> is critical for wine fermentations performed by S. cerevisiae[*]×[*]S. kudriavzevii hybrid strains from the Eg 8 cluster. Indeed, when Eg 8 hybrids undergo lipid deprivation, their acetic acid production increases and their liberation of thiols is modified, leading to more passion fruit aromas and less box tree and citrus notes (the 4 MMP released is lower and the acetylation of 3 MH increases). Therefore, as the <b>clarification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>must</b> is critical for the lipid content (Cocito and Delfini 1997), a must clarification strategy needs to be chosen according to the aromatic profile that the winemaker is searching for while minimizing the risk of excessive acetic acid production. Further improvement of these strains needs to be performed {{in order to obtain}} new starters that can maximize 3 MHA production without the risk of excessive acetic acid production.|$|R
25|$|The {{amount of}} YAN needed {{will depend on}} what the winemaker's goals are for fermentation, {{particularly}} whether or not wild fermentation is desired or if the wine will be fully fermented to dryness. The state of the grapes and the conditions of fermentation will influence the amount of nitrogen needed. Fruit that is damaged, moldy or botrytis infected will usually be more depleted of nitrogen (as well as other vitamin resources) {{when they come in}} from the vineyard than clean, intact grapes. This depletion can be further exacerbated by over <b>clarification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>must</b> and high sugar content. Wines fermented at higher temperatures tend to progress at a faster rate, requiring more nitrogen than longer, cooler fermentation. Also the amount of oxygen exposure will influence the rate of nitrogen uptake by the yeast with wine fermented in complete anaerobic conditions (such as many white wines in stainless steel tanks) requiring less nitrogen than wines fermented in barrels or open top fermentors.|$|R

25|$|In 1447, Johannes Mentelin {{gained the}} rights of a Strasbourg citizen. He was first a Goldschreiber (calligrapher and book scribe) by {{profession}} and worked in addition as an episcopal notary. Exactly when and where he learned the technique of book printing is not known. Since {{at the end of}} the 1450s, when Mentelin founded his Strasbourg printery, there was still no other place where printing was done besides Mainz, it is likely that he either got his knowledge directly there or through a middleman. Such a go-between might have been Heinrich Eggestein. It is suspected that he had been introduced to the trade of book printing during his stay in Mainz from Johannes Gutenberg. He did not set up his own Offizin (an old German term for a book printery) until the middle of the 1460s. Due to a lack of sources, the final <b>clarification</b> <b>of</b> this question <b>must</b> unfortunately remain unanswered for now. From the available data, it can however be concluded that Mentelin was the first book printer active in Strasbourg (and thus one of the first anywhere in Europe), even before Eggestein.|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the performance of treatment plants {{after three years of}} operation of the city of Nouakchott. It essentially aims to study the evolution of various raw water qualities during the different processing steps (T °, pH, EC, MES, Cl-, NO 3 -, NO 2 -, sulfate [...] .). The water treatment in Béni Nadji pretreatment station has led to a significant removal of turbidity, organic matter, and a 99 - 100 % elimination of SS (Suspended Solids). For drinking water, the total hardness varies between 3. 8 and 5. 6 °fH. The value of turbidity in drinking water was between 0. 2 and 0. 3 NTU with turbidity varying between 21 and 330 NTU in the surface water. Aluminum surface concentration surface was between 0. 1 and 0. 7 mg·L- 1. The nitrate concentration varies between 0. 5 and 2 mg·L- 1, which is lower than that suggested by The World Health Organization (50 mg·L- 1). As a result of this study, we concluded that water <b>clarification</b> phases <b>of</b> Nouakchott <b>must</b> be improved...|$|R
