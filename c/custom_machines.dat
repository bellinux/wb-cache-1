40|$|Over {{the past}} few years there has been {{increased}} interest in building custom computing machines (CCMs) as a way of achieving very high performance on specific problems. The advent of high density field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), in combination with new synthesis tools, have made it relatively easy to produce programmable <b>custom</b> <b>machines</b> without building specific hardware. In many cases, the performance achieved by a FPGA based custom computer is attributed to the exploitation of massive concurrency in the underlying application. In this paper we explore the sources of speedup for irregular problems in which is difficult to exploit such parallelism. We highlight 5 main sources of speedup that we have observed, namely the provision of high memory bandwidth, the use of flexible address generation hardware, the use of gather-scatter array operations, the use of lookup tables and the use of multiple tailored arithmetic units. By considering some representative examples of such irreg [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of a}} {{parallel}} program {{is to reduce the}} execution time, compared to the fastest sequential program solving the same problem. Parallel programming is growing due to the widespread use of network of workstations (NOWs) or powerful PCs in high-performance computing. Because the hardware components are all commodity devices, NOWs are much more cost-effective than <b>custom</b> <b>machines</b> with similar technology. In this environment, the typical programming model used has been message-passing and the MPI library has become the standard in the distributed-memory computing model. On the other hand, visual programming environments try to simply the task of developing applications. They provide programmers with several standard components for creating programs. Delphi constitutes {{one of the most popular}} visual programming environments nowadays in the Windows market place. In this paper, we present MPI [...] Delphi, an implementation of MPI for writing parallel applications using Delphi visual programming environment. We show how MPI [...] Delphi has been developed, and how it makes possible to manage a cluster of homogeneous/heterogeneous PCs. Two examples of use of MPI [...] Delphi in a heterogeneous cluster of workstations with a mixture of Windows and Linux operating systems are also included. The MPI [...] Delphi interface is suitable for some specific kinds of problems, such as monitoring parallel programs of long execution time, or computationally intensive graphical simulations. In addition, MPI [...] Delphi has proven to be a good tool for research, as the development of new algorithms can be carried out quickly and, therefore, time spent on the debugging of such algorithms is reduced. Finally, we conclude by explaining some of the tasks we think MPI [...] Delphi is suitable for. 2002 Elsevier Science [...] ...|$|E

40|$|A rapid {{prototyping}} environment, called SAMUEL, for creating <b>custom</b> computing <b>machines</b> is described. The <b>custom</b> computing <b>machines</b> are synthesized by a compiler from a general purpose algorithmic language and {{a library of}} Verilog opcode circuits. The opcode circuits implement the interpretation rules defined for the algorithmic language. The compiler produces as output a Verilog description of the <b>custom</b> computing <b>machine.</b> This description {{can be used for}} simulation, or for synthesis with commercial tools;The opcode library makes SAMUEL unique among other research work that has been documented by raising the semantic level of the level 0 circuits. SAMUEL is also unique because the algorithmic language used is not a hardware description language, and it has not been modified in any way from the original language definition. Finally, SAMUEL is unique because the language chosen supports dynamic procedure definition. This allows a procedure to transform into a completely different procedure at runtime. This is language-supported reconfigurability which enhances the current research trends in reconfigurable devices;Custom computing machines generated by SAMUEL can be described using the scheme given by Milutinovic as software translated, language corresponding, complex, directly executing architectural support for the high-level language Euler (1). The approach differs from other work, however, by exploiting the field programmability of gate arrays (and the freedom guaranteed by a simulation environment) to create <b>custom</b> computing <b>machines</b> that only support the required language opcodes. This is important when the limited real-estate space of programmable logic is considered. Averaged real-estate savings can be achieved by not implementing support for the entire language on every <b>custom</b> computing <b>machine...</b>|$|R
