But, in fact," [...] said Klesmer, suddenly dropping from his quick narrative to a reflective tone, with an impressive frown, [...] "I am very sensible to wit and humor." ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{access control mechanism}} that enforces at the network level an access control decision that is taken at the application level. The mechanism {{is based on the}} pre-computation of encrypted counters <b>called</b> <b>tickets.</b> An access enforcement device verifies the existence of a valid ticket in each packet that is subject to access control and kills unauthorized packets. Tickets are not computed {{as a function of the}} user data. Due to the timing constraints of shared media LANs the presence of a valid ticket in a packet proves that the operation implied by the user data has been authorized. The access control mechanism is elaborated for Internet protocols over Ethernet and we discuss its properties for internetworking and multicasting...|$|R
5000|$|Skyline was a newgrass group {{active in}} the 1970s and '80s headed by Tony Trischka. The band {{consisted}} of Tony, Danny Weiss on guitar and vocals, Dede Wyland on guitar and vocals, Larry Cohen on bass, and Barry Mitterhoff on mandolin. In {{the last year of}} their career Dede Wyland left the band and was replaced by Rachel Kalem. They were a major proponent of the [...] "newgrass" [...] sound, known for jazz-infused riffs and extensive use of harmony in their singing. Their first album, Skyline Drive, was released in 1977. The band released several more albums over the next few years, culminating with their final release, Fire of Grace in 1989.

500|$|This [...] "system" [...] {{is still}} {{controversial}} to many guests. Some {{view it as}} a way to cut lines by paying extra money. Ironically Cedar Point did have a similar system in the early 2000s(first <b>called</b> <b>Ticket</b> to Ride and then FreeWay), but has in 2004 discontinued it because they were charged with [...] "sanctioning line-jumping". This Fast Pass is the updated version which is supposed to be less problematic for other guests, even though the general idea is the same. It is a way to make lines shorter only for the people with the Pass. The other guests in line actually get a longer wait time because the Fast Pass individuals may get on the ride a few times in the same duration of one normal wait time.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} flexible abstractions for specifying {{resource management}} policies, together with efficient mechanisms for implementing those abstractions. Several novel scheduling techniques are introduced, including both randomized and deterministic algorithms that provide proportional-share control over resource consumption rates. Such control {{is beyond the}} capabilities of conventional schedulers, and is desirable across {{a broad spectrum of}} systems that service clients of varying importance. Proportional-share scheduling is examined for several diverse resources, including processor time, memory, access to locks, and disk bandwidth. Resource rights are encapsulated by abstract, first-class objects <b>called</b> <b>tickets.</b> An active client consumes resources at a rate proportional to the number of tickets that it holds. Tickets can be issued in different amounts and may be transferred between clients. A modular currency abstraction is also introduced to flexibly name, share, and protect [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{a variant}} of the {{electronic}} cash protocol, an electronic coupon protocol, a withdrawn coin is divided into many sub-coins whose face values are fixed in advance, and the sub-coins are only used in payments. The original coin is <b>called</b> <b>ticket</b> and the sub-coins are called sub-tickets. The electronic cash protocol should satisfy not only the anonymity that the payer cannot be traced from the payments, but also the unlinkability. The unlinkability means that anyone cannot determine whether payments were made by the same payer. If the unlinkability does not hold, tracing the payer from one payment leads to tracing the payer from all his/her payments, and the link between the payments also facilitates the de-anonymization. In the previously proposed electronic coupon protocol, payments of sub-tickets derived from the same ticket are linkable. Since the complete anonymity of payments facilitates fraud and criminal acts, the electronic cash protocols should equip the revocati [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to address the role of ICT-support call-centres in {{supporting}} mobile professionals. In global organisations, mobile professionals require constant and continuous access to information services. In modern global banking firms, ICTs are intensively utilised for electronic transactional processing and in supporting banking professionals in accomplishing their global tasks across geographical locations and time zones. The use of ICTs by global mobile bankers is crucial to access real-time information, anytime and anywhere. In their remote mobility, banking professionals may experience technology failure or difficulties in accessing information services. This inability of the banking mobile professionals in utilising ICTs could have serious consequences in terms of risk on the bank operations and profit. The ICT-support call-centres play major roles in supporting the mobile user. This paper discusses how a global help desk unit accomplishes this role in a global banking organisation. This is achieved through analysis of the <b>call</b> <b>tickets</b> from the global helpdesk tracking system...|$|R
