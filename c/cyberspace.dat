5|$|Soon after, Rebecca {{contacts}} the hacker, {{and says}} that she has convinced TriOptimum to authorize the station's destruction; she provides him with details {{on how to do}} this. After obtaining the necessary codes, the hacker initiates the station's self-destruct sequence and flees to the escape pod bay. There, the hacker defeats Diego a second time, then attempts to disembark. However, SHODAN prevents the pod from launching; it seeks to keep the player aboard the station, while the bridge—which contains SHODAN—is jettisoned to a safe distance. Rebecca tells the hacker that he can still escape if he reaches the bridge; SHODAN then intercepts and jams the transmission. After defeating Diego for the third time and killing him for good, the hacker makes it to the bridge as it is released from the main station, which soon detonates. He is then contacted by a technician who managed to circumvent SHODAN's jamming signal. The technician informs him that SHODAN can only be defeated in <b>cyberspace,</b> due to the powerful shields that protect its mainframe computers. Using a terminal near the mainframe, the hacker enters <b>cyberspace</b> and destroys SHODAN. After his rescue, the hacker is offered a job at TriOptimum, but he declines in favor of continuing his life as a hacker.|$|E
40|$|Cybrids {{have been}} {{presented}} as mixed realities: spatial, architectural compositions comprised of physical and <b>cyberspaces</b> (Anders 1997). In {{order to create a}} rigorous approach to the design of architectural cybrids, this paper offers a model for programming their spaces. Other than accepting <b>cyberspaces</b> as part of architectureis domain, this approach is not radical. Indeed, many parts of program development resemble those of conventional practice. However, the proposition that <b>cyberspaces</b> should be integrated with material structures requires that their relationship be developed from the outset of a project. Hence, this paper provides a method for their integration from the projectis earliest stages, the establishment of its program. This study for an actual project, the Planetary Collegium, describes a distributed campus comprising buildings and <b>cyberspaces</b> in various locales across the globe. The programming for these cybrids merges them within a comprehensive space consisting not only of the physical and <b>cyberspaces,</b> but also in the cognitive spaces of its designers and users...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Cyberworlds {{are being}} formed in <b>cyberspaces</b> as {{computational}} spaces. Now <b>cyberspaces</b> are rapidly expanding on the Web either intentionally or spontaneously, {{with or without}} design. Widespread and intensive local activities are melting {{each other on the}} web globally to create cyberworlds. The major key players of cyberworlds include e-finance that trades a GDP-equivalent a day and e-manufacturing that is transforming industrial production into Web shopping of product components and assembly factories. Lacking proper theory and design, cyberworlds have continued to grow chaotic and are now out of human understanding and control. This research first presents a generic theoretical framework and design based on algebraic topology, and also provides an axiomatic approach to theorize the potentials of cyberworlds. key words: social impacts of cyberworlds, algebraic topological theory of cyberworlds, axiomatizing cyberworlds, e-financing, e-manufacturing, e-commerc...|$|R

One possible reason is that unfamiliar interfaces of SVWs can be a barrier to novice users’ adaptation of the technology. To understand a role of interfaces in the users’ assimilation of SVWs, we examine an impact of three interface factors (presence, affordance, and feedback) on performance which {{is regarded as a}} yardstick for users’ adaptation of SVWs. Forty participants were recruited and went through one-hour experimental sessions with seven tasks in Second Life; they were also asked to answer a questionnaire.

However, theoretical studies and contemporary works reveal a more complex relationship between media and constructions.

Hence the paper argues that “cybrid architecture ” is not technological, but is a modification of conventional architectural space due to cultural evolution. Development The concept of “cybrid architecture ” has been diffused mainly by Peter Anders [’ 97], as well as in LatinAmerica by Gonzalo Velez [’ 95]. Both authors defined this term as the integration of physical and digital spaces. Suggesting to create hybrid constructions composed by <b>cyberspaces</b> and real rooms. Based on the capability of electronic media to generate virtual environments which could be related to buildings, in order to expand the possibilities of architectural design and to reach some economic advantages in the construction industry. However, this univocal relationship between material and electronic surroundings has been realised only temporally in artistic installations or entertainments. (Fig. 2) On one hand, a research carried on by us [García et al, 00], and others around the world [Fencott, 99, Isdale, 00; Huang, 01], have demonstrated that design of virtual environments requires a different approach than buildings. Although the development of digital spaces could be a labour opportunity for some architects, they must be aware that several issues of the design process are distinct. The lack of materiality involves a change of composition of elements, but also a different interaction of the user with the surrounding.

In my work I {{have been looking}} at how we might create drama through using <b>cyberspaces,</b> working with teachers and students in secondary school contexts. In trying to understand issues that have arisen and ways of working with the data I have found a number of frameworks helpful for analysing the online interactions. These frameworks draw from O'Toole's work on contexts negotiated in the creation of drama and other frameworks drawn from Wertsch, Bakhtin and Vygotsky's work on speech utterances, dialogic processes and internalisation of learning. The contexts and factors which must be negotiated in online communications within learning contexts are quite complex and educators may need to provide parameters and protocols to ensure appropriate languages, genres and utterances are utilised. The paper explores some of the types of languages, genres and utterances that emerged from a co-curricula drama project and issues that arose, including the importance of establishing processes for giving and receiving critical feedback This paper is of relevance to those whose research strategies may involve the use of computer-mediated communications as well as those utilising <b>cyberspaces</b> in educational contexts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A cyber world (CW) is a {{digitized}} world {{created on}} <b>cyberspaces</b> inside computers interconnected by networks including the Internet. Following ubiquitous computers, sensors, e-tags, networks, information, services, etc., is a road towards a smart world (SW) created on both <b>cyberspaces</b> and real spaces. It is mainly characterized by ubiquitous intelligence or computational intelligence pervasion {{in the physical}} world filled with smart things. In recent years, many novel and imaginative researcheshave been conducted to try and experiment a variety of smart things including characteristic smart objects and specific smart spaces or environments as well as smart systems. The next research phase to emerge, we believe, is to coordinate these diverse smart objects and integrate these isolated smart spaces together into a higher level of spaces known as smart hyperspace or hyper-environments, and eventually create the smart world. In this paper, we discuss the potential trends and related challenges toward the smart world and ubiquitous intelligence from smart things to smart spaces and then to smart hyperspaces. Likewise, we show our efforts in developing a smart hyperspace of ubiquitous care for kids, called UbicKids.

40|$|Against the {{background}} of growing <b>cyberspaces,</b> I am exploring here some consequences for understanding digital technologies along three paths. The first path begins by noting how the increasing efficiency of computation has {{given birth to a}} new kind of artifact, the interface. Its characteristics require us to abandon naturalistic conceptions of technology and call, instead, for an effort to understand their users 2 ̆ 7 diverse understandings, to a second order understanding of technology. My second path starts from the curious fact that 17 th Century Enlightenment ideas still permeate our celebrations of what the new technologies do while blinding us to the coordination of human activities they cause on an unprecedented scale. This leads us to a new image of human beings as dialogical constituents of networks. My last path begins with interfaces, with what is left in <b>cyberspaces</b> after data, algorithms, and networks have taken up their places, and leads us to languaging as a window to a second-order understanding of others, as a community’s way of co-ordinating co-ordination (of technology), and as our opportunity to redirect our creative attention towards keeping technology human-centered...|$|R
