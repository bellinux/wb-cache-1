50|$|Several weeks later, Alexander {{viewed the}} tape and {{discovered}} {{that one of the}} <b>clamshell</b> <b>charges</b> had blown a big hole {{in the top of the}} riser. The explosion had also rocked one of the 16-inch flow lines out of its clamps, displacing it 30 feet below its original position. BNOC would later contract the massive semi-submersible workshop, Narwhal, on a “no cure, no pay” basis to remove the riser and take it to shore.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the right}} ring has a {{negative}} charge, it similarly attracts positive charge into the right-hand stream. When drops break {{off the end of}} that stream, they carry positive charge to the positively <b>charged</b> <b>bucket,</b> making that bucket even more positively charged.|$|R
50|$|Alexander flew to Aberdeen, and by {{the next}} day he was taken out to the diving support vessel Tender Carrier in the Thistle Field. On board the Carrier, Alexander {{ultimately}} decided to have the jumper hoses blown off with explosives. Explosives experts were brought out to the ship with their gear and divers placed <b>clamshell</b> <b>charges</b> around the jumper hoses. On January 23, 1979, the signal was given and Alexander heard a bang and saw bubbles come to the surface. A diver was sent down to have a look and discovered that, although both charges had gone off, only one of the hoses had been cut.|$|R
30|$|The COWSO is {{very active}} {{and close to}} the {{groundwater}} users. It has established a system of paying water <b>charges</b> per <b>bucket,</b> fetching water {{in the presence of the}} water agent at every water point who collects water charges. Generally, the COWSO oversees all groundwater governance activities properly.|$|R
40|$|The EAF steel {{production}} process currently provides very stringent limits on emissions but {{the environmental impact}} appears to be minor, if compared to blast furnace cycle. The electric arc furnace operates as a batch process. The scrap yard operators classify and prepare buckets of scrap according to the chemical and production needs of the Electric Arc Furnace. The study about {{the preparation of the}} <b>charge</b> <b>bucket</b> is becoming an important operation, in order to ensure proper melt chemistry and good melting conditions. Actually, most of charging operations are based on buckets, where different kind of scrap is charged inside. The addition of high quantity of shredded scrap can increase the concentration of unwanted alloy elements inside the metal bath. The use of HBI can be considered a good operational practice both for increasing the melt yield and for decreasing the high quality scrap fraction used in the EAF cycle. This implies a decrease of the environmental impact, without affecting the production and it avoids the high concentration of undesired elements (e. g. Sulphur, Copper, Tin), due to the charge of low quality scrap...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of experimental two phase, charge-coupled shift registers constructed using polysilicon gates overlapped by aluminum gates was studied. Shift registers with 64, 128, and 500 stages were built and operated. Devices were operated at the {{maximum clock frequency}} of 20 MHz. Loss per transfer of less than. 0001 was demonstrated for fat zero operation. The effect upon transfer efficiency of various structural and materials parameters was investigated including substrate orientation, resistivity, and conductivity type; channel width and channel length; and method of channel confinement. Operation of the devices with and without fat zero was studied as well as operation in the complete charge transfer mode and the bias <b>charge,</b> or <b>bucket</b> brigade mode...|$|R
5000|$|So {{positive}} {{charges are}} attracted to the right-hand stream by the ring, and positive charge drips into the positively <b>charged</b> right <b>bucket.</b> Negative <b>charges</b> {{are attracted to}} the left-hand stream and negative charge drips into the negatively <b>charged</b> left <b>bucket.</b> This process of charge separation that occurs in the water is called electrostatic induction. The higher the charge that accumulates in each bucket, the higher the electrical potential on the rings and the more effective this process of electrostatic induction is. [...] During the induction process, there is an electric current that flows {{in the form of}} positive or negative ions in the water of the supply lines. This is separate from the bulk flow of water that falls through the rings and breaks into droplets {{on the way to the}} containers. For example, as water approaches the negatively charged ring on the right, any free electrons in the water can easily flee toward the left, against the flow of water. Eventually, when both buckets have become highly charged, several different effects may be seen. An electric spark may briefly arc between the two buckets or rings, decreasing the <b>charge</b> on each <b>bucket.</b> If there is a steady stream of water through the rings, and if the streams are not perfectly centered in the rings, one can observe the deflection of the streams prior to each spark due to the electrostatic attraction via Coulomb's law of opposite charges.As charging increases, a smooth and steady stream may fan out due to self-repulsion of the net charges in the stream. If the water flow is set such that it breaks into droplets in the vicinity of the rings, the drops may be attracted to the rings enough to touch the rings and deposit their charge on the oppositely charged rings, which decreases the charge on that side of the system. In that case also, the buckets will start to electrostatically repel the droplets falling towards them, and may fling the droplets away from the buckets. Each of these effects will limit the voltage that can be reached by the device. The voltages reached by this device can be in the range of kilovolts, but the amounts of charge are small, so there is no more danger to persons than that of static electrical discharges produced by shuffling feet on a carpet, for example.|$|R
5000|$|In South Africa, bucket toilets - {{frequently}} {{referred to}} as the [...] "bucket system" [...] - are still used in 2016 in some low-income communities as a relic of the Apartheid era. During that era, the poor, predominantly black townships generally did not get proper sanitation. The term [...] "bucket toilet" [...] or [...] "bucket system" [...] is nowadays very much stigmatized in South Africa and politically <b>charged.</b> Protests against <b>bucket</b> toilets are still occurring. , 5.3 percent of households in South Africa either had no toilets, or used bucket toilets.|$|R
50|$|The Mesoamerican bath; {{known as}} temazcal in Spanish, from the Nahuatl word temazcalli, a {{compound}} of temaz ("steam") and calli ("house"), consists of a room, often {{in the form of}} a small dome, with an exterior firebox known as texictle (teʃict͜ɬe) that heats a small portion of the room's wall made of volcanic rocks; after this wall has been heated, water is poured on it to produce steam, an action known as tlasas. As the steam accumulates in the upper part of the room a person in charge uses a bough to direct the steam to the bathers who are lying on the ground, with which he later gives them a massage, then the bathers scrub themselves with a small flat river stone and finally the person in <b>charge</b> introduces <b>buckets</b> with water with soap and grass used to rinse. This bath had also ritual importance, and was vinculated to the goddess Toci; it is also therapeutic when medicinal herbs are used in the water for the tlasas. It is still used in Mexico.|$|R
40|$|A bunch-by-bunch {{longitudinal}} {{feedback system}} based on a programmable DSP architecture is used to study coupled-bunch motion and its sources. Experimental results are presented from PEP-II, DA NE, ALS and SPEAR to highlight the operational experience from 4 installations, plus show novel accelerator diagnostics possible with the digital processing system. Modal growth and damping rates are measured via short (20 ms) transient recordings for unstable and stable coupled-bunch modes. Data from steady-state measurements are used to identify unstable modes and noise-driven beam motion. Anovel impedance measurement technique is presented which reveals the longitudinal impedance {{as a function of}} frequency. This technique uses the measured synchronous phase and <b>charge</b> of every <b>bucket</b> to calculate the impedance seen by the beam at revolution harmonics...|$|R
25|$|Prior to Napoleon, the {{drinking}} water of Paris came either from the Seine, from wells in the basements of buildings, or from fountains in public squares. Water bearers, mostly from the Auvergne, carrying two buckets on a pole over their shoulder, carried water from the fountains or, since there was a charge for water from fountains, or, if the fountains were too crowded, from the Seine, to homes, for a charge of a sou (five centimes) for a bucket of about fifteen liters. The fountains were supplied with water by two large pumps next to the river, the Samaritaine and Notre-Dame, dating from the 17h century. and by two large steam pumps installed in 1781 at Chaillot and Gros Caillou. In 1800 there were fifty-five fountains for drinking water in Paris, one per each ten thousand Parisians. The fountains only ran at certain hours, were turned off at night, {{and there was a}} small <b>charge</b> for each <b>bucket</b> taken.|$|R
40|$|PEP-II is a 2. 2 -km-circumference {{collider}} with a 2. 1 -A, 3. 1 -GeV positron ring (the Low-Energy Ring) 1 m above a 1 -A, 9 -GeV electron ring (the High-Energy Ring); both {{rings are}} designed to allow an upgrade to 3 A. Since June 1997, we have had three runs totaling 14 weeks to commission the full HER, reaching a current of 0. 75 A. Positrons were transported through the first 90 m of the LER in January 1998, with full-ring tests planned for the summer. This workshop provides a timely opportunity to review {{the design of the}} beam diagnostics and their performance, with an emphasis on what works, what doesn t, and what we re doing to improve it. This paper discusses: the synchrotron-light monitor, including both transverse imaging onto a CCD camera and longitudinal measurements with a streak camera; beam-position monitors, with processors capable of 1024 -turn records, FFTs, and phase-advance measurements; tune measurements with a spectrum analyzer, including software for peak tracking; measurements of both the total ring current and the <b>charge</b> in each <b>bucket,</b> for real-time control of the fill; and beam-loss monitors using small Cherenkov detectors for measuring losses from both stored and injected beam...|$|R
5000|$|The Ottinger {{investigation}} {{began in}} late May. On May 17, 1923, McGee and Fuller were indefinitely {{committed to the}} Ludlow Street Jail for contempt of the Federal court, when they failed to return certain papers connected to the investigation. [...] On May 21, 1923, W. S. Silkworth told Federal Receiver Harold P. Coffin at {{a hearing on the}} bankruptcy case, that confidential reports about the firm received by the exchange had recently disappeared. William Silkworth testified on June 6 in the Criminal Courts Building to be questioned regarding the recent bankruptcy. Although Assistant Attorney General William F. McKenna failed to implicate Silkworth in the Fuller bankruptcy, he did uncover irregularities in Silkworth's personal finances. The irregularities showed he had made large deposits in March 1922, some related to the Fuller account. On June 6, 1923, Fuller and McGee were sentenced to fifteen months to fours years, to begin serving in June 1927. That day, Judge Henry W. Goddard signed an unusual order for Fuller to be brought from the Ludlow Street Jail each day under armed guard to the General Sessions of the Fuller trial, concerning the indictment <b>charging</b> him with <b>bucketing</b> a stock order. They were on trial for twelve grand larceny and bucketing indictments.|$|R
