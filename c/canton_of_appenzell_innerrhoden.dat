5|$|By the mid 20th century, in some European countries, {{women still}} lacked some {{significant}} rights. Feminists {{in these countries}} continued to fight for voting rights. In Switzerland, women gained {{the right to vote}} in federal elections in 1971; but in the <b>canton</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appenzell</b> <b>Innerrhoden</b> women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. In Liechtenstein, women were given the right to vote by the women's suffrage referendum of 1984. Three prior referendums held in 1968, 1971 and 1973 had failed to secure women's right to vote.|$|E
25|$|Although {{conservative}} in many ways, Germany nevertheless differs from other German-speaking regions in Europe, being much more progressive on women's {{right to be}} politically involved, compared to neighbouring Switzerland (where women obtained {{the right to vote}} in 1971 at federal level, and at local canton level in 1990 in the <b>canton</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appenzell</b> <b>Innerrhoden)</b> and Liechtenstein in 1984. In Germany, there are also strong regional differences; for instance Southern Germany (particularly Bavaria) is more conservative than other parts of Germany; while former East Germany is more supporting of women's professional life than former West Germany.|$|E

2500|$|From the mid 20th {{century the}} status of women {{improved}} greatly. Although Japan is often considered a very conservative country, it was in fact earlier than many European countries on giving women legal rights in the 20th century, as the 1947 Constitution of Japan [...] provided a legal framework favorable to the advancement of women’s equality in Japan. Japan for instance enacted women's suffrage in 1946, earlier than several European countries such as Switzerland (1971 at federal level; 1990 on local issues in the <b>canton</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appenzell</b> <b>Innerrhoden),</b> Portugal (1976 on equal terms with men, with restrictions since 1931), San Marino in 1959, Monaco in 1962, Andorra in 1970, and Liechtenstein in 1984.|$|E
2500|$|Blatter {{was born}} in the <b>canton</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appenzell</b> <b>Innerrhoden</b> in northeastern Switzerland in a region near Mount Säntis.

50|$|The 135 {{members of}} the National Council were elected in 48 single- and multi-member {{constituencies}} using a three-round system. Candidates had to receive {{a majority in the}} first or second round to be elected; if it went to a third round, only a plurality was required. Voters could cast as many votes as there were seats in their constituency. For the first time the National Council was directly-elected in its entirity; in previous elections the <b>cantons</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appenzell</b> <b>Innerrhoden,</b> <b>Appenzell</b> Ausserrhoden, Glarus, Nidwalden, Obwalden and Uri had their National Council members elected by the Landsgemeinde. However, an electoral law passed in 1872 required secret voting for federal elections and a polling station to be opened in every municipality in order to avoid manipulation in the open Landsgemeinde. The electoral law also changed the calculation of a candidate's majority from including valid and invalid votes to only valid votes.|$|R

5000|$|The Demoex {{system is}} a {{political}} hybrid which uses e-democracy to inject direct democracy into a system of representative democracy. This creates a semi-representative democracy, similar to {{one that has been}} used in Switzerland since the late 19th century. [...] In pure direct democracy, there are no representatives, or there are only proxy representatives with limited power. By contrast, in a representative democracy, the elected representatives have all the power to make political decisions. The Swiss Landsgemeinde {{is one of the oldest}} and purest forms of direct democracy. [...] It was originally introduced in the Swiss <b>Canton</b> <b>of</b> Uri in 1231, and was structured as an open-air gathering, usually in springtime, where votes were expressed by a show of raised hands. This system is still used in the <b>Canton</b> <b>of</b> Glarus and <b>Appenzell</b> <b>Innerrhoden.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Alpstein (<b>cantons</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appenzell</b> Ausserrhoden, <b>Appenzell</b> <b>Innerrhoden</b> and St. Gallen, northeastern Switzerland) {{has been}} of great {{interest}} for geologists over the last decades because of its excellent outcrops. However, there was no comprehensive overview over its Cretaceous fossil content. Here, we describe the cephalopod associations, which are moderately to highly diverse in some strata of the Alpstein. Furthermore, we document the regional palaeoecological changes {{that occurred during the}} radiation of heteromorph ammonites (ancyloceratids, scaphitids, turrilitids). To examine the palaeoecological changes, we quantitatively determined the macrofossil content of 11 associations of Barremian to early Cenomanian age. Here, we document 6 species (3 genera) of nautilids and 77 species (45 genera) of ammonoids (29 of the species are recorded from Switzerland for the first time). Our palaeoecological analyses revealed the disappearance of nektoplanktonic forms after the late Barremian to the middle early Aptian {{in the course of the}} development of a shallow carbonate platform. The upper lower Aptian to middle Albian strata were eroded due to successive emersion phases and condensation processes. In the late Albian, the number of nektoplanktonic species surged again with some benthos, followed by the Cenomanian fauna, which is dominated by nektoplanktonic elements including ammonites, belemnites and nautilids with only very little benthos. These results correlate well with the regional sea level fluctuations...|$|R
