25|$|Credit <b>card</b> <b>debt</b> has {{increased}} steadily. Since the late 1990s, lawmakers, consumer advocacy groups, college officials and other higher education affiliates {{have become increasingly}} concerned about the rising use of credit cards among college students. The major credit card companies {{have been accused of}} targeting a younger audience, especially college students, many of whom are already in debt with college tuition fees and college loans and who typically are less experienced at managing their own finances. Credit <b>card</b> <b>debt</b> may also negatively affect their grades as they are likely to work more both part and full-time positions.|$|E
25|$|Florida has 4 {{cities in}} the top 25 {{cities in the}} U.S. with the most credit <b>card</b> <b>debt.</b> The state also had the second-highest credit card {{delinquency}} rate, with 1.45% of cardholders in the state more than 90 days delinquent on one or more credit cards.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} the {{successful}} passing of the motion, Layton started the NDP election campaign, first with a speech in Ottawa followed {{later in the day}} by an event in Edmonton, Alberta. Questions about Layton's health due to a recent hip surgery were often directed to him during the campaign, with Layton insisting that he was healthy enough to lead. On March 29, 2011, the New Democrats presented their first real campaign promise, a proposal to cap credit card rates in order to reduce credit <b>card</b> <b>debt.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} empirically {{antecedents of}} the credit <b>card</b> <b>debts</b> in young consumers in Malaysia. We examine whether easy access to credit card, credit card related knowledge, aggressive promotion by credit card industry, low minimum payment requirement and attitude towards credit cards influence credit <b>card</b> <b>debts</b> in the younger generation. Regression model was used to meet the objectives. These findings based on a sample of 240 young credit card holders, show that the factors that affect credit <b>card</b> <b>debts</b> are credit <b>card</b> related knowledge, aggressive promotion by credit card industry and low minimum payment requirements. These findings also provide insights for both bank management and policy-makers to improve the bank performance in terms of credit <b>card</b> <b>debts...</b>|$|R

25|$|Governments issue {{government}} bonds {{in their own}} currency and sovereign bonds in foreign currencies. State and local governments issue municipal bonds to finance projects or other major spending initiatives. Debt issued by government-backed agencies is called an agency bond. Companies can issue a corporate bond or obtain money from a bank through a corporate loan. Preferred stocks {{share some of the}} characteristics of fixed interest bonds. Securitized bank lending (e.g. credit <b>card</b> <b>debt,</b> car loans or mortgages) can be structured into other types of fixed income products such as ABS â€“ asset-backed securities which can be traded on exchanges just like corporate and {{government bonds}}.|$|E
25|$|Securitization is the {{financial}} practice of pooling {{various types of}} contractual debt such as residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans or credit <b>card</b> <b>debt</b> obligations (or other non-debt assets which generate receivables) and selling their related cash flows to third party investors as securities, which may be described as bonds, pass-through securities, or collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Investors are repaid from the principal and interest cash flows collected from the underlying debt and redistributed through the capital structure of the new financing. Securities backed by mortgage receivables are called mortgage-backed securities (MBS), while those backed by other types of receivables are asset-backed securities (ABS).|$|E
25|$|Discount brands {{are often}} smaller, {{regional}} chains or independent stations, offering lower prices on gasoline. Most purchase wholesale commodity gasoline from independent suppliers {{or from the}} major petroleum companies. Lower-priced gas stations are also found at some supermarkets (Albertsons, Kroger, Ingles, Lowes Foods, Giant, Weis Markets, Safeway, Vons, Meijer, Loblaws/Real Canadian Superstore, and Giant Eagle), convenience stores (7-Eleven, Circle K, Cumberland Farms, Quick Chek, Road Ranger, Sheetz and Wawa), discount stores (Walmart, Canadian Tire) and warehouse clubs (Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's Wholesale Club). At some stations (such as Vons, Costco, BJ's Wholesale Club, or Sam's Club), consumers are required to hold a special membership card {{in order to be}} eligible for the discounted price, or pay only with the chain's cash <b>card,</b> <b>debt</b> card or a credit card issuer exclusive to that chain. In some areas, such as Oregon and New Jersey, this practice is illegal, and stations are required to sell to all at the same price. Some convenience stores, such as 7-Eleven and Circle K, have co-branded their stations with one of the premium brands. After the Gulf Oil company was sold to Chevron, northeastern retail units were sold off as a chain, with Cumberland Farms controlling the remaining Gulf Oil outlets in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|However, many {{financial}} analysts estimate {{such concerns}} {{are based upon}} mirror-imaging of the Western model and do {{not take into account}} the already proven Asian Tiger model. Yet, recently, credit <b>card</b> <b>debt</b> has become a major problem, as the ROC does not have an individual bankruptcy law. [...] Taiwan also remains undeveloped in some sectors, such as the lack of a bond market, a role that has been filled by small entrepreneur-oriented investment or direct investment by foreign persons.|$|E

2500|$|Securities {{backed by}} credit card {{receivables}} have been benchmark for the ABS market since they were first introduced in 1987. [...] Credit card holders may borrow funds on a revolving basis up to an assigned credit limit. [...] The borrowers then pay principal and interest as desired, along with the required minimum monthly payments. [...] Because principal repayment is not scheduled, credit <b>card</b> <b>debt</b> {{does not have an}} actual maturity date and is considered a nonamortizing loan.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, {{the median}} generic FICO score was 723 in 2006 and 711 in 2011. [...] The {{performance}} {{definition of the}} FICO risk score (its stated design objective) is to predict {{the likelihood that a}} consumer will go 90 days past due or worse in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated. [...] The higher the consumer's score, the less likely he or she will go 90 days past due in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated. [...] Because different lending uses (mortgage, automobile, credit card) have different parameters, FICO algorithms are adjusted according to the predictability of that use. [...] For this reason, a person might have a higher credit score for a revolving credit <b>card</b> <b>debt</b> when compared to a mortgage credit score taken at the same point in time.|$|E

30|$|I combine {{three main}} data sets {{for the purpose}} of the study. The first data set is {{regional}} financial series on the use of consumer credits and outstanding credit <b>card</b> <b>debts.</b> These statistics were collected and disseminated by the Finturk portal of the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency of Turkey (BRSA) for the years 2009 to 2012. Total consumer credits include credits for vehicle purchases, mortgages, bank credit accounts, outstanding credit <b>card</b> <b>debts,</b> and other consumer credits. Regrettably, the BRSA does not provide regional data before 2008 on the grounds that banks reported most of the financial indicators (such as regional credits) as if they pertained to the Istanbul region {{due to the fact that}} credits were approved by the headquarters in Istanbul (Turkeyâ€™s financial capital), even when the real recipient of the credit actually resided elsewhere. Starting from 2008, reporting procedures were improved to reflect the correct regional financial outlook.|$|R

2500|$|Startups {{have several}} options for funding. Venture capital firms and angel investors may help startup {{companies}} begin operations, exchanging seed money for an equity {{stake in the}} firm. Venture capitalists and angel investors provide financing {{to a range of}} startups (a portfolio), with the expectation that {{a very small number of}} the startups will become viable and make money. In practice though, many startups are initially funded by the founders themselves using [...] "bootstrapping", in which loans or monetary gifts from friends and family are combined with savings and credit <b>card</b> <b>debt</b> to finance the venture. Factoring is another option, though it is not unique to startups. Other funding opportunities include various forms of crowdfunding, for example equity crowdfunding, in which the startup seeks funding from a large number of individuals, typically by pitching their idea on the Internet.|$|E
2500|$|A {{suitably}} large {{portfolio of}} assets is [...] "pooled" [...] {{and transferred to}} a [...] "special purpose vehicle" [...] or [...] "SPV" [...] (the issuer), a tax-exempt company or trust formed for the specific purpose of funding the assets. [...] Once the assets are transferred to the issuer, there is normally no recourse to the originator. The issuer is [...] "bankruptcy remote", meaning that if the originator goes into bankruptcy, {{the assets of the}} issuer will not be distributed to the creditors of the originator. In order to achieve this, the governing documents of the issuer restrict its activities to only those necessary to complete the issuance of securities. Many issuers are typically [...] "orphaned". In the case of certain assets, such as credit <b>card</b> <b>debt,</b> where the portfolio is made up of a constantly changing pool of receivables, a trust in favor of the SPV may be declared in place of traditional transfer by assignment (see the outline of the master trust structure below).|$|E

50|$|In April 1997, {{a lawsuit}} against General Electric Capital Corp was filed {{on behalf of the}} company's {{customers}} who filed for bankruptcy. The GE Capital Corp. was accused of unfair debt collection practices. The class action lawsuit resulted in $100 million settlement with over 100,000 class members from 50 states.Plaintiffs claimed that the company solicited agreements from bankrupt debtors to repay their credit <b>card</b> <b>debts</b> but failed to notify bankruptcy court of the agreement. Those reaffirmation agreements legally required the debtors to continue paying off their debt in exchange for keeping the credit card, even though bankruptcy erases credit <b>card</b> <b>debts.</b> The lawsuit claimed that GE Capital was required by law to file the agreements with bankruptcy courts and did not do so.As part of the settlement, the company agreed to refund, with interest, all credit card payments made after debtors entered into the reaffirmation agreements between January 1, 1993, and June 30, 1997. GE Capital Corp. also promised to advise credit bureaus to correct any negative credit reports related to class membersâ€™ failure to repay reaffirmed debt.|$|R
