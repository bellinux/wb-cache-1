Following external fistula maturation, a change from external to internal drainage was performed using Roux-en-Y fistulojejunostomy. A 3 -year postoperative period was uneventful. Conclusion. Pancreas divisum cases are unique requiring clinical experience, rational approach, and complex multimodal management. MRCP is a valuable diagnostic method. Amongst therapeutic options, outer and internal drainage can be seen as reliable methods. Further investigations are absolutely required to determine practical and appropriate conclusions...|$|E

Both the urobilinogen solution in which stercobilinogen is mainly included and the mesobilinogen solution coloured with the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent, display the absorption maxima at 560 mμ and 490 mμ at the pH 4. 2. 2. When the hydrogen ion density of the above <b>coloured</b> <b>solution</b> becomes below 4. 0, the absorption maxima display at 558 mμ and 490 mμ or 492 mμ. Both of these absorption maxima are not moved by the change of pH. 3. In proportion as the pH of the <b>coloured</b> <b>solution</b> becomes high more than 42, the absorption maximum at 560 mμ shifts slightly to the short wave length and displays at 556 mμ or 554 mμ, but the absorption maximum at 490 mμ shifts to the long wave length in a relatively prominent degree and displays at 506 mμ or 510 mμ. As the pH of the <b>coloured</b> <b>solution</b> becomes showing a alkaline reaction, the absorption maximum at 560 mμ disappears and the absorption maximum at 490 mμ shows shifting to the opposite direction, the short wave length. 4. On the use of methanol, as a solvent, instead of water, both of them display the absorption maxima at 550 mμ and 490 mμ at the pH 5. 4. And no differences are observed, on the change of the pH, between the coloured substances of stercobilinogen and mesobilinogen with the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent. 5. As for the absorption maximum of mesobilinogen is observed shifting to the long wave length for 1 or 3 mμ more than that of stercobilinogen under the acid-and weak acid condition of pH. 6. The coloured substances of the sodium-, potassium- and ammonium salts of urobilinogen with the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent display the same absorption maxima by the change of the pH value, but the absorption maximum shifts to the short wave length for 2 mμ on the occasion of preparing the salts by adding several times of the computation dosis of caustic soda, caustic potash and ammonia more than on the occasion of preparing the salts by adding the computation dosis of them or the absorption maximum of the coloured substance of stercobilinogen itself with the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent at the pH 1. 4 - 1. 0, and it displays at 556 mμ. 7. When the Ehrlich's aldehyde reaction is obtained immediately after the process being moved into caustic soda from the petroleum ether stratum on the preparation of stercobilinogen from stool, the absorption maximum displays only at 556 mμ at the pH 1. 6 without showing the absorption maximum around 490 mμ. Therefore, it is thought that the absorption maximum at 420 mμ is not coexisted with the absorption maximum around 560 mμ when the oxidation is prevented on the preparation of urobilinogen or during it's process, and that the absorption maximum of the coloured substance with the Ehrlich's aldehyde reaction displays only one around 560 mμ and the absorption maximum around 490 mμ belongs to that of the urobilin oxygenated from urobilinogen. 8. The coloured substance of mesobilinogen dimethylester with the Ehrlich's aldehyde reagent displays the absorption maxima at 550 mμ and 488 mμ at the pH 3. 8. 9.

The per­cent dye removal increased with increasing sorbent dose and temperature of the aqueous solution, and decreased with increasing dye concentration; the re­quired contact time was five hours.

The molar absorptivity and Sandell's sensitivity for the <b>coloured</b> <b>solution</b> were found to be 4. 37 x 10 4 L mol- 1 cm- 1 and 0. 0013 -µg. cm- 2 for Co (II) -HDMBHBH, 6. 5 x 10 4 L mol- 1 cm- 1, and 0. 0009 -µg. cm- 2 for Co (II) -CMHBH respectively. The interference effects of various diverse ions have been studied. Co (II) forms 1 : 1 complex with HDMBHBH and 1 : 2 with CMHBH stoichiometry with stability constant 11. 47 x 10 6 for Co (II) ...|$|E
40|$|Two simple, sensitive, {{rapid and}} {{selective}} spectrophotometric {{methods have been}} developed for the determination of Palladium (II) using newly synthesized reagents 4 -Hdroxy 3, 5 dimethoxy benzaldehyde- 4 -hydroxybenzoylhydrazone (HDMBHBH) and Cinnamaldehyde 4 -hydroxy benzoylhydrazone (CMHBH) in presence of neutral surfactant TritonX- 100 - 5 % (micellar medium). Palladium (II) forms a brown coluored water-soluble complex with HDMBHBH and CMHBH-in the pH range 1. 0 - 6. 0. The Pd (II) -HDMBHBH complex shows maximum absorbance at max 373 nm in the pH range 3. 0 - 4. 0 and Pd (II) -CMHBH shows at max 375 nm in thepH range 4. 0 - 5. 0. At these wavelengths (max), the complex shows maximum absorbance while the reagent blanks shows negligible absorbance. Hence, analytical studies were carried out at max 373 nm at pH 3. 0 for HDMBHBH and 375 nm at pH 4. 0 for CMHBH against reagent blanks. Beer's law is obeyed in the range 0. 106 - 1. 064 μg ml- 1 and the optimum concentration range from ringbom plot is 0. 212 - 0. 957 g/ml of Palladium (II) for both reagents. The molar absorptivity and Sandell's sensitivity for the <b>coloured</b> <b>solution</b> were found to be 7. 5 x 104 L mol- 1 cm- 1 and 0. 0015 -μg. cm- 2 for HDMBHBH, 6. 0 x 104 L mol- 1 cm- 1, and 0. 0017 -μg. cm- 2 for CMHBH respectively. The interference effects of various diverse ions have been studied. Palladium (II) forms 1 : 1 complex with HDMBHBH and CMHBH stoichiometry with stability constant 7. 29 x 106 for HDMBHBH and 3. 55 x 106 for CMHBH. The standard deviation in the determination of 0. 638 -μg ml- 1 of Palladium (II) is 0. 003 for HDMBHBH and 0. 008 for CMHBH. The Relative standard deviation is 0. 71 % for HDMBHBH and 2. 5 % for CMHBH. First and second order derivative spectroscopic methods were developed at max 422 nm and 444 nm for HDMBHBH and at 402 nm and 438 nm for CMHBH respectively, for the determination of Palladium (II), which is more sensitive than the zero order method. The developed method has been employed for the determination of Palladium (II) in hydrogenation catalyst samples, synthetic alloy samples and in water samples. The results are in good agreement with the certifiedvalues...|$|E
50|$|An unknown {{sample is}} {{treated with a}} small amount of {{elemental}} bromine in an organic solvent, being as dichloromethane or carbon tetrachloride. Presence of unsaturation and/or phenol in the sample is shown by disappearance of the deep brown coloration of bromine when it has reacted with the unknown sample. The formation of a brominated phenol in form of a white precipitate indicates that the unknown was a phenol. The more unsaturated an unknown is, the more bromine it reacts with, and the less <b>coloured</b> the <b>solution</b> will appear.|$|R
40|$|A {{sample of}} pyrrhotite, {{mechanically}} separated from it's host rock, is dissolved in excess concentrated hydrochloric acid. Iron and any traces of copper present are oxidised by potassium chlorate. The {{strength of the}} hydrochloric acid solution is adjusted to 8. 0 Molar and {{the bulk of the}} iron is extracted with iso-propyl ether. Traces of cobalt, copper, zinc, cadmium and residual iron are separated from lead and nickel by passing the extracted solution through a column containing Dowex 1 -X 10 - a strongly basic quaternary amine anion exchange resin. The traces are adsorbed as anionic chloro-complexes. The adsorbed metal traces and residual iron are then separated one by one by elution of the resin with hydrochloric acid of diminishing concentrations. The trace metals thus separated are determined quantitatively by simplified colourimetric techniques. The absorption of the <b>coloured</b> <b>solutions</b> is determined with a Beckman Model D. U. Quartz Spectrophotometer, corrected for reagent absorption and compared with the results obtained by using known quantities of the particular metal. A sensitivity of 1 to 2 ppm., may be expected, with results accurate to Â± 10 per cent at all but the lowest concentrations. By making suitable chemical or ion exchange separations of the macro elements, the method may be extended to a variety of other sulphides and acid extracts from crushed rocks, soil samples and others. Carefully purified reagents must be used throughout. Note:Page 64 is missing in the original thesis...|$|R
50|$|In 1852, Beer {{published}} {{a paper on}} the absorption of red light in <b>coloured</b> aqueous <b>solutions</b> of various salts. Beer makes use of the fact, derived from Bouguer’s and Lambert’s absorption laws, that the intensity of light transmitted through a solution at a given wavelength decreases exponentially with the path length d and the concentration c of the solute (the solvent is considered non-absorbing). Actually, the “Absorption Coëfficient” defined by Beer in his paper is the transmittance (or transmission ratio), T = I / I0. Thus, as pointed out by Beer, the transmittance of a concentrated solution {{can be derived from}} a measurement of the transmittance of a dilute solution (Beer, 1852).|$|R
