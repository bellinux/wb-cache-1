5|$|September 4, 2003– Rip {{currents}} from Hurricane Fabian cause one drowning death near <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gale {{warnings}} and small craft advisories were issued {{along the coast}} of North Carolina stretching from Wilmington to <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{cold front}} moved off the East Coast of the United States on July 16 and stalled {{off the coast}} of North Carolina. It {{gradually}} decayed into a surface low pressure trough, and developed into two disturbances; one was centered 290miles (490km) south-southeast of Cape Cod and another was located 200miles (320km) south of <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras,</b> North Carolina. The first low quickly organized into an unnamed tropical storm, and the other area initially remained broad and ill-defined. However, by July 18, the system became much better organized with improved banding features, and the area developed into Tropical Depression Two while located 220miles (355km) south-southeast of <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} of the tropical depression, officials in Puerto Rico closed public schools and sent federal workers home early. At 1000UTC on August28, a tropical storm watch was issued for Edisto Beach, South Carolina, to <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras,</b> North Carolina. Two hours later, areas from Savannah, Georgia, to <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras</b> North Carolina, were placed under a tropical storm warning. They were later discontinued at an unknown time. Residents of Charleston, South Carolina, complained of little warning {{in advance of the}} storm. However, as Chris moved ashore only nine hours after becoming a tropical storm, there was minimal time for preparations.|$|E
5|$|June 14, 1566– Two {{vessels in}} the Spanish fleet of Ángel de Villafañe sink off <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras,</b> which is {{believed}} to have been caused by a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for {{the coast of}} the United States from Savannah, Georgia to Wilmington, North Carolina at 1600 UTC on September 28, which were quickly updated to hurricane warnings by 1900 UTC the same day. By 1900 UTC, gale warnings were in effect from Daytona Beach, Florida to Savannah, Georgia as well as from Wilmington to Morehead City, North Carolina. At 1200 UTC on September 29, gale warnings were dropped south of Brunswick, Georgia. At 2200 UTC, gale warnings were extended northward to Cape May, New Jersey, including Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay. At 0400 UTC on September 30, all warnings south of <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras</b> were dropped, leaving gale warnings in effect from <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras</b> northward. At 1000 UTC, small craft were advised to remain in port from Cape May northward to Block Island, Rhode Island. By 1600 UTC, due to Gracie's continued weakening, all remaining gale warnings were downgraded to small craft warnings.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the center}} of Gustav passed just {{to the east of}} <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras,</b> areas of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia {{experienced}} heavy rain and tropical storm force winds. Parts of the Outer Banks received 2–5inches (50–125mm) of rain and winds of up to 50mph (80km/h), and the Coast Guard station at <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras</b> reported a wind gust of 78mph (125km/h). The storm produced storm surges of 3– along the Outer Banks, and 1– along the southeastern coast of Virginia. These surges, combined with strong winds and high sea swells, resulted in minor flooding, mainly in Ocracoke and Hatteras Village, North Carolina. A weak waterspout also touched down on Silver Lake near Ocracoke and moved onshore, but only minor roof damage was reported. Sporadic power outages were also reported. One person died after suffering injuries in the high surf, and 40 other people had to be rescued from riptides and storm surges. Damage in the region amounted to $100,000 (2002USD).|$|E
5|$|During mid-May, {{a frontal}} {{boundary}} stalled near The Bahamas and slowly degenerated. On May25, a shortwave trough caused the northern {{portion of the}} system to move north of the Bahamas. The following day, an {{area of low pressure}} developed along the boundary about 290miles (465km) south-southwest of Wilmington, North Carolina. Tracking towards the north, the system became increasingly organized. On May27, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began issuing Tropical Weather Outlooks for the low while it was located about 120miles (195km) south of <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras,</b> North Carolina. An upper-level ridge situated to the southeast of the system was steering it towards the northeast. The NHC issued their final outlook on the low around 0000UTC on May28 while the system was located about 90mi (150km) east of <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras,</b> North Carolina, as development of the low was not expected.|$|E
5|$|The {{broad and}} disorganized remnant low {{remained}} nearly stationary {{due to a}} ridge of high pressure to its north. Residual convection within the remnants of Henri remained disorganized, but forecasters kept watch for the potential for redevelopment. However, it moved inland near <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras</b> on September 12 without reorganizing. The remnants continued {{to the north and}} dissipated on September 17 over New England.|$|E
5|$|The first {{documented}} hurricane of 1842 severely affected coastal North Carolina from Wilmington to Currituck on July 12. Its center likely remained {{just east}} of <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras</b> as it washed away houses, drowned livestock, and wreaked havoc on shipping interests. Nearly 30 ships ran aground near Ocracoke Inlet, and two unidentified vessels were wrecked on the shoals near <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras</b> with all hands lost; seven more men drowned while trying to salvage goods from the shipwrecks. In late October, a message in a bottle was recovered at Bermuda with {{an account of the}} storm from the captain and first mate of the imperiled schooner Lexington, presumed lost at sea. In total, around 40 ships were lost. Although sparse records preclude an accurate death toll, the National Hurricane Center lists the cyclone among those that may have caused 25 or more fatalities.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the storm, gale warnings were issued on August 19 from Jacksonville, Florida to Virginia Beach, Virginia. A hurricane watch was also posted between Savannah, Georgia and <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras,</b> North Carolina. The hurricane watch was later extended to Jacksonville when conditions appeared more favorable for the storm's intensification, but was soon discontinued. Flooding rains were anticipated in the Carolinas, though, in contrast, Dottie was compared to a mere thunderstorm by some local officials.|$|E
5|$|The 21st, about 960 strong, {{boarded the}} steamer Northerner on January 6, 1862. The fleet {{transporting}} Burnside's North Carolina Expedition encountered harsh weather {{off the coast}} of <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras.</b> Prolonged poor weather and the shallowness of Hatteras Inlet resulted in weeks of delay as the fleet struggled to enter Pamlico Sound. Finally, just as most of the vessels began to run low on potable water, the fleet entered the sound and made for Roanoke Island on February 5, 1862.|$|E
5|$|While {{the design}} of Monitor was well-suited for river combat, her low {{freeboard}} and heavy turret made her highly unseaworthy in rough waters. Under the command of John P. Bankhead, Monitor put to sea on 31 December, under tow from , as a heavy storm developed off <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras,</b> North Carolina. Using chalk and a blackboard, Bankhead wrote messages alerting Rhode Island that if Monitor needed help she would signal with a red lantern.|$|E
5|$|A surface trough of low {{pressure}} with {{an area of}} convection persisted off the southeast coast of the United States on September 18. On the same day, a weak tropical wave which moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on September 8 approached the area. A cold front merged with the stationary area of disturbed weather on September 20, and on September 22 a circulation developed 200miles (325km) southeast of <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras,</b> North Carolina. Organization continued as outflow became better defined, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Six later that day.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{developed into}} Tropical Storm Barbara over the Bahamas on August11. It intensified {{as it moved}} north-northwestward, becoming a hurricane by the next day, and reaching peak winds of 90mph (150km/h) just south of <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras</b> on August13. Barbara moved over the Outer Banks, passing between Morehead City and Ocracoke, and it turned and accelerated to the northeast. Steadily weakening and losing tropical characteristics, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on August15. It turned northward, crossing eastern Nova Scotia and dissipating over Labrador on August16.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Ophelia {{moved past}} <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras</b> it {{turned to the}} east. Wind shear {{increased}} on September 16 and weakened Ophelia into a tropical storm for the last time. Ophelia turned to the northeast and brushed past Nantucket Island, Massachusetts on the next day. As it approached Nova Scotia on September 17, the storm became extratropical, but maintained its strength as it made landfall in the extreme eastern portion of the province. The extratropical storm passed over southern Newfoundland later that day, before finally dissipating on September 23 in the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{hurricane}} began affecting land, the U.S. Weather Bureau issued northeast storm warnings from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras,</b> North Carolina. The agency also advised small {{boats in the}} region to remain at port during the storm. Evacuations were ordered for a few islands in the Outer Banks, and several thousand tourists voluntarily left the coastline for safer areas. Overall, about 50,000people evacuated due to {{the hurricane}}. Further north, the Coast Guard advised people to avoid swimming along the coast of Long Island.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 27, {{the storm}} {{weakened}} below tropical storm status and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while moving over cooler waters. The system dissipated shortly after over open waters. Although the storm remained over {{water for the}} duration of its existence, the outer reaches of the system brought rain and light winds to Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas. In Jacksonville, Florida, the storm produced 0.47 in (11.9 mm) of rain on August 25. Between August 26 and 27, <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras</b> received 2.06 in (52.3 mm) of rain from the storm.|$|E
5|$|Further north, the {{hurricane}} threatened to strike or move {{very close to}} the Outer Banks. Hurricane warnings were posted from <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras</b> to Manteo, and ships were advised to remain at port. Hurricane How produced 50mph (80km/h) winds and high tides along the Outer Banks and southeastern Virginia. Some minor damage was reported, and two ships were washed ashore. In New England, the Weather Bureau issued storm warnings from Block Island, Rhode Island to Portland, Maine, with rains, fog, and heavy surf reported. Several roads were closed in Massachusetts due to the tides.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, a {{schooner}} carrying {{four people}} capsized in rough seas roughly 250mi (400km) east of <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras,</b> North Carolina on June30. The four crew were {{a father and}} his three kids. A diabetic, the 30-year-old father searched for his insulin pen in the capsized ship; however, for the fifteen days they were stranded, {{he was unable to}} find it. During the event, he slipped into a coma and later died on July4, leaving his kids on the boat. On July14, the three kids were rescued by the Ellinora, a Greek merchant ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} gradient between Tropical Storm Danielle and a ridge of high pressure to its north produced moderately strong winds across eastern North Carolina, peaking at 58mph (93km/h) at Alligator River Bridge. Several other locations reported over tropical storm force winds. The {{pressure gradient}} also produced {{higher than normal}} waves along the coastline, with a maximum of 20feet (6m) at Duck. Despite passing close to the coastline, Danielle dropped only light rainfall, totaling to 0.2inches (5mm) at <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras.</b> However, locations in the central portion of the state experienced over 1inch (25mm) of rainfall.|$|E
5|$|While {{bypassing}} the Outer Banks, Emily produced strong winds that coincided with high tides during a full moon, causing severe flooding along the Pamlico Sound. In Buxton, the floods left behind water marks {{as high as}} , and the entire villages of Avon and Hatteras were inundated. The storm downed thousands of trees and wrecked 553homes—168 of which completely destroyed—leaving {{a quarter of the}} <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras</b> population homeless. Structural damage in North Carolina was estimated at $35million. Along the coasts of North Carolina and Virginia, three swimmers drowned as a result of Emily.|$|E
5|$|A {{cold front}} moved eastward through the United States {{in the middle}} part of July, and reached the East Coast of the United States on July23. By the {{following}} day, a low pressure area developed just southeast of <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras,</b> North Carolina ahead of the frontal zone, and quickly formed into a subtropical depression. In association with a nearby upper-level low, the depression tracked quickly southeastward before turning to the southwest. The subtropical depression gradually organized, and satellite classifications began subsequent to merging with a tropical wave on July25. Convection developed closer {{to the center of}} circulation as it gradually decelerated while continuing southwestward and on July27, the system organized into Tropical Depression Three while located about 335miles (539.1km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} {{was located}} in the central Gulf of Mexico on September 9, potentially the same hurricane as the previous storm. It tracked generally eastward toward the coast of Florida, with its hurricane intensity estimation based on two ship reports. At about 0000UTC on September 12, it moved ashore near Clearwater, Florida as a minimal hurricane, with an estimated minimum barometric central pressure of 985mbar. Accelerating east-northeastward while crossing the state, the cyclone emerged into the Atlantic Ocean as a weakened tropical storm before regaining hurricane status on September 13. Later that day, it was last observed about 250mi (400km) east-southeast of <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{making its}} final Florida landfall, Allison rapidly weakened. Tropical storm force winds {{continued}} over the eastern Florida Panhandle until late that afternoon, {{as the storm}} moved northward into Georgia. It weakened to a tropical depression {{on the evening of}} June 5 over southern Georgia. Early on June 6, Allison began to transition into an extratropical storm as it interacted with a warm front to the northeast while tracking across the Carolinas. The remnant low emerged into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras</b> that evening. It then raced across the western Atlantic, crossing the easternmost part of Nova Scotia on June 8 and Newfoundland on June 9. It continued northward across the Labrador Sea, dissipating on June 11.|$|E
5|$|After the Confederates {{were forced}} to destroy Virginia as they withdrew in early May, Monitor sailed up the James River to support the Union Army during the Peninsula Campaign. The ship participated in the Battle of Drewry's Bluff later that month and {{remained}} in the area giving support to General McClellan's forces on land until she was ordered to join the blockaders off North Carolina in December. On her way there she foundered while under tow, during a storm off <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras</b> {{on the last day}} of the year. Monitors wreck was discovered in 1973 and has been partially salvaged. Her guns, gun turret, engine and other relics are on display at the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} approached the United States East Coast on August 31, the United States Weather Bureau advised extreme caution to ships between <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras</b> and southern areas of New England. Storm warnings were issued for coastal regions between Wilmington, North Carolina and the Virginia Capes. These warnings were later extended northward to the Delaware Breakwater. Strong winds exceeding gale-force were expected {{for much of}} the East Coast, particularly for <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras.</b> On September1, hurricane warnings were ordered for areas from Hatteras, North Carolina to Pamlico Sound, while previously issued storm warnings remained in place. On September2, gale warnings extended further north into Nantucket, Massachusetts. In Norfolk, Virginia, city department heads were ordered to stand by for potential emergency duties. United States Coast Guard personnel were also dispatched along the North Carolina coast. United States Navy personnel were detained in New London, Connecticut until the storm passed. In Westhampton, New York, a mass evacuation occurred, involving 10,000residences. Air traffic to and from Mitchel Air Force Base was cancelled, and 100airplanes stationed at the base were fastened to the ground. Police and firemen evacuated a 50mi (80km) stretch of the Rhode Island coastline. This included Roy Carpenter's Beach, where 1,000families were forced to evacuate. In Narragansett Bay, boats were sent back to harbors or towed to shore. The extensive precautionary measures undertaken occurred in part due to fears that the storm would cause similar effects to a destructive hurricane which swept through areas of New England two years prior.|$|E
5|$|Cindy {{prompted}} a hurricane watch and gale warnings for areas extending from <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras,</b> North Carolina, to Charleston, South Carolina, and a hurricane warning for areas between Beaufort and Georgetown, South Carolina, on July 8. A preliminary alert was issued for naval and marine {{areas in the}} Carolinas from Norfolk, Virginia. Special forecasts from the Weather Bureau office in Columbia, South Carolina were activated on the radio at 16:50 UTC on July 8. Several thousand people evacuated in areas of South Carolina, including Folly Beach, Sullivan's Island, Isle of Palms, and Pawleys Island. The issuance of an emergency flood forecast for Columbia, South Carolina occurred {{as a result of}} Cindy.|$|E
5|$|Flooding was {{reported}} throughout the Outer Banks {{in relation to}} the heavy rains and storm surge of the storm. The storm required the shutdown of North Carolina Highway 12, the only highway connecting the area to the mainland, isolating those who decided to stay behind. Many residents lost power as numerous power lines fell from strong winds. Six brief tornadoes, ranging between F0 and F1 on the Fujita scale, struck the state within squall lines in the outer rainbands of Hurricane Bob. Four tornadoes in Dare County, North Carolina, caused $256,000 in damage. Near <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras,</b> wind severely damaged one structure, which lost its roof and some siding.|$|E
5|$|Gustav moved erratically to the west-northwest {{toward the}} North Carolina-South Carolina border {{over the next}} two days, it slowly strengthened, {{acquiring}} more tropical characteristics. On September 10, a poorly organized band of stronger winds developed around the center, and Gustav was designated a fully tropical storm shortly before turning toward the north and brushing <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras,</b> then accelerating toward the northeast and away from the coast. On September 11, while under the influence of a non-tropical system over New England, Gustav quickly strengthened into a hurricane, in a process similar to the intensification of Hurricane Michael in 2000. Gustav reached its peak intensity of 100mph (160km/h) later that day.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Able {{was a rare}} {{hurricane}} {{that formed}} outside the typical North Atlantic hurricane season. The first tropical cyclone in 1951, Able developed from a trough of low pressure on May 15 about 300miles (480km) south of Bermuda. Initially subtropical in nature, Able acquired tropical characteristics as it moved over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream and attained hurricane status on May 17 {{off the coast of}} Florida. This made Able one of only four May Atlantic hurricanes on record. On May 22 Able reached peak winds of 90mph (150km/h) about 70miles (115km) off <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras,</b> North Carolina. The hurricane weakened as it turned eastward, and became an extratropical cyclone on May 23.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gladys was {{the first}} Atlantic {{hurricane}} to be observed each by the Hurricane Hunters, radar imagery, and photographs from space. The seventh named storm and fifth hurricane (including one unnamed hurricane) of the 1968 season, Gladys formed on October13 in the western Caribbean from a broad disturbance related to a tropical wave. The storm moved north-northwestward, becoming a hurricane before striking Cuba on October16. Gladys later reached peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) just before making landfall near Homosassa on the western coast of Florida on October19. The hurricane crossed the state and continued northeastward, passing just east of <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras</b> on October20. The next day, Gladys became extratropical and was absorbed by a cold front over Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{efforts in}} 1995 by Navy and NOAA divers {{to raise the}} warship's {{propeller}} were foiled by an abnormally stormy season off <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras.</b> Realizing that raising the whole wreck was impractical for financial reasons {{as well as the}} inability to bring up the wreck intact, NOAA developed a comprehensive plan to recover the most significant parts of the ship, namely her engine, propeller, guns, and turret. It estimated that the plan would cost over 20 million dollars to implement over four years. The Department of Defense Legacy Resource Management Program contributed $14.5 million. The Navy divers, mainly from its two Mobile Diving and Salvage Units, would perform the bulk of the work necessary in order to train in deep sea conditions and evaluate new equipment.|$|E
5|$|It {{originated}} {{in an area}} of low pressure that developed over the western Gulf of Mexico on December10, downstream from an upper-level cyclone. The surface low tracked northward to Oklahoma before turning eastward as it gradually intensified. Simultaneously, a shortwave trough swung southeastward around the periphery of a large vortex over central and eastern Canada. As the upper low opened up into a negatively tilted trough and began to interact with the northern wave, a secondary surface cyclone developed along a frontal boundary over South Carolina late on December11. Almost immediately thereafter, the original low dissipated over West Virginia. Heading toward the northeast, the incipient storm emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near <b>Cape</b> <b>Hatteras,</b> North Carolina, at 00:00UTC on December12.|$|E
