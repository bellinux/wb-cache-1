40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the relationship between}} ethylene evolution from the grains and the appearance quality of rice, ten different rice genotypes {{were used to determine}} the ethylene evolution rate, 1 -aminocylopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) concentration in grains during grain filling and the appearance quality of rice, and the effects of chemical regulators on concentrations of ethylene and ACC in the grains during grain filling were also investigated to verify the roles of ethylene in the rice quality formation. The ethylene evolution rates and ACC concentrations in grains during the mid and late grain filling stages were very significantly and positively correlated with <b>chalky</b> <b>kernel</b> percentage and chalkiness. The cultivars with a low ACC concentration in grains exhibited a close amyloplast arrangement and small space between starch granules, whereas those with a high ACC concentration in grains showed a loose arrangement and wide space between the granules. Application of 1 μmol/L ACC to panicles at mid and late grain filling stages significantly loosened amyloplast arrangement and increased <b>chalky</b> <b>kernel</b> percentage, chalky area and chalkiness, and the results were reversed when 1 μmol/L amino-ethoxyvinylglycine, an inhibitor of ACC synthesis enzyme, was applied to panicles. A practice of moderate dry-wet alternate irrigation reduced ethylene evolution and ACC concentration in grains and thereby reduced chalkiness. The results suggested that ethylene and ACC in grains {{play an important role in}} the endosperm structure and appearance quality of rice, and the appearance quality would be improved by reducing ethylene evolution and ACC in grains through either variety breeding and selection, or chemical regulations or cultivation techniques...|$|E
40|$|The Opaque- 2 (O 2) gene encodes a {{transcriptional}} activator specifically expressed for grain {{development of}} maize. o 2 mutants have an opaque and <b>chalky</b> <b>kernel,</b> with {{a decrease in}} zein storage protein content, {{and an increase in}} the proportions of lysine and tryptophan. In this review, we present recent results investigating genetic properties of the O 2 network, using transcriptome and proteome approaches, associated with measurements of activities of enzymes of the aspartate pathway and lysine degradation. The structural polymorphism at the O 2 locus was investigated by RFLP in a collection of 51 maize inbred lines. Most polymorphic sites were found outside the coding regions. We then searched for relationships between RFLP polymorphism and (i) mRNA abundance of O 2 and of known or suspected target genes, (ii) activity of SDH and (iii) amount of zein isoforms. Polymorphic restriction sites in the 5 ' upstream regions of the O 2 gene were found associated with O 2 mRNA abundance (three sites) and the amount of two 19 kDa alpha-zein isoforms (two sites). One restriction site on the 3 ' side of the O 2 gene was found associated with Lor/Sdh mRNA abundance. Our results indicate relationships between polymorphism at the O 2 locus and the expression of some of its target genes. Evidence of these associations has to be confirmed on larger samples, and the analysis of the O 2 gene sequence should allow more precise testing of the actual involvement of O 2 polymorphism in its own transcriptional expression, and in the expression of its target genes...|$|E

A kernel intake and spread device is designed on the systemto spread rice kernel into rice shape hole drilled on a carrying belt. The beltconvey kernels to under a CCD camera for image taking. A Pentium- 133 MHzpersonal computer apply to image processing and grading each kernel intocategories. The grabed kernel information transfer through RS- 232 interface intothe system''s control PLC. On outlet device, the PL C can precisely open highspeed electro-magnetic valves to blow high speed air to associate kernel in themoving belt into proper containers. The system utilizes machine vision to grab "Tainung 67 " brown rice. From animage of maximum 24 isolated brown rice kernels, 14 quality related parametersare calculated from each kernel. The parameters include projection area, ratioof area to perimeter, compactness, ratio of {{long and short}} axles from Hotellingtransformation, sum of length differences of short axles to their mean, sum ofabsolute value of length difference of short axles to their mean, average graylevels of red, green and blue component, standard deviations of gray leveldistribution of red, green and blue, and chalky area ratio. From theseparameters, brown rice kernel can be classified into sound kernel, discoloredkernel, <b>chalky</b> <b>kernel,</b> off-type kernel, rusty kernel, green immature kernel, abnormal kernel and rice screening eight categories. From the procedures of system performance adjusting and evaluation, it isobserved that the spread device can have higher efficiency when there is morekernels, over 2000 kernels, put into the intake device. The average rate ofkernels properly spread into belt holes is 81 %. When the belt speed controlmotor is on 33 rpm and air pressure is 4. 5 Kgw/cm 2, the outlet device havehigher performance to deliver kernel into the container it belongs to. In thesesetting conditions, the kernel cracking by machine is scarce. The outlet devicehave 36 nozzles categorized into six groups. When the system is under proper setting, in this study, the average correctclassification rate is over 80 %. The correct classification rate of sound kernel(fissured kernel is not excluded) is also over 80 %. The sound kernel containershave highest correct rate 95 %. The method of second run classification ofkernels in those containers with lower correct rate can improve the overallcorrect rate and highly increase the correct rate of sound kernelclassification...|$|E
30|$|The japonica {{cultivar}} “Koshihikari” {{showed significant}} deterioration in appearance quality of kernels caused by abnormal starch accumulation due to exposure to ozone. The alteration patterns of amylose and amylopectin in ozone-exposed rice kernels {{are similar to}} those in rice kernels harvested from SSIIIa-deficient mutants. These findings suggest that the increase of <b>chalky</b> <b>kernels</b> in ozone-treated “Koshihikari” is partly attributable to the repressed expression of SSIIIa involved in amylopectin side-chain elongation with ozone exposure. Elevated ozone reduced appearance quality in “Koshihikari” although it did not impair starch properties contributing to the eating quality of cooked rice.|$|R
30|$|Elevated ozone {{significantly}} increased {{the proportion of}} immature (mainly <b>chalky)</b> <b>kernels</b> in “Koshihikari” but not in “Kasalath”. Scanning electron microscopy of transverse sections of kernels showed that endosperm starch granules of “Koshihikari” ripened under elevated ozone were loosely packed with large spaces and contained irregular rounded granules. Amylose content was increased in “Koshihikari” kernels with ozone exposure, but was unchanged in “Kasalath” kernels. Distribution analysis of amylopectin chain length showed that ozone induces a decrease of long-side chains and alterations of short side-chains in “Koshihikari” kernels. Furthermore, Starch Synthase (SS) IIIa transcript levels in “Koshihikari” caryopses were decreased by elevated ozone.|$|R
30|$|The japonica {{cultivar}} “Koshihikari” showed deteriorations {{in appearance}} quality under ozone stress, which {{occurred at a}} level of ozone insufficient to cause grain yield reduction. The deterioration in grain quality was induced by abnormal starch accumulation under elevated ozone levels as well as by high-temperature stress. However, the alteration patterns of amylose and amylopectin in ozone-exposed “Koshihikari” were similar to those in SSIIIa-deficient rice mutants rather than those in kernels ripened under high-temperature. Furthermore, the SSIIIa transcript in “Koshihikari” caryopses was suppressed by elevated ozone levels. Thus, the increase in <b>chalky</b> <b>kernels</b> in “Koshihikari” may result from the decreased expression, under elevated ozone, of SSIIIa involved in amylopectin side-chain elongation.|$|R
40|$|A rice {{sorting system}} with machine vision for normal kernel, {{discolored}} kernel, <b>chalky</b> <b>kernel</b> and broken kernel {{had been developed}} in this study. The decision tree, linear discriminant analysis, and K Nearest Neighbor classification methods were investigated. This system consists of rice feeding, inspection with machine vision, and sorting with air spray. For rice feeding, the system applied the oscillator to separate the piles of grains and the grains were delivered along the five rice chutes. For inspection with machine vision, a CCD camera was used to grab image of rice, and the image processing was conducted. For sorting with air spray, discolored kernels were removed by air jet from nozzle. The scanner was used to establish R, G, and B characteristic information of rice when in static. On the other hand, a color CCD camera was used to do the dynamic inspection. The rice image were processed in some techniques, such as separation of background, Laplacian operation, threshold operation, computation of the center position of grain, and evaluation of the gray scale values in R-, G-, and B-layer of region. For sorting by grain’s color, the LDA one-dimensional projection classification and LDA two-dimensional projects with KNN were used to conduct the rice classification. The image recognition accuracies were 82. 8 % and 84. 8 % and sorting accuracies were 76. 6 % and 75. 3 % respectively. For sorting by grain’s geometry, accuracy of image recognition between normal kernel and broken kernel in using projected areas classification was 93. 2 %. 本研究應用機器視覺，針對白米之正常粒、異色粒、白堊質粒、碎粒等，發展一套白米選別系統，並探討決策樹、線性識別分析、最近鄰居法等三種分類法之性能。系統包括進料輸送、機器視覺辨識、與噴氣選別等組成。系統進料輸送的部分，應用震盪器將成堆的米粒分散，搭配五個米粒滑道輸送；機器視覺辨識部分，運用CCD攝影機拍攝米粒，並進行影像辨識；噴氣選別部分，利用噴嘴噴除異色米粒。先透過掃描器建立米粒靜態R、G、B特徵資訊，再應用CCD攝影機進行動態檢測，其中白米影像資訊處理流程，包含背景分離、Laplacian運算、二值化、計算米粒中心位置與區域灰階值等，能有效地得到各米粒R、G、B灰階值。在米粒顏色部份，結合使用LDA一維投影與LDA二維投影+KNN分類進行白米選別，影像辨識正確率分別為 82. 8 %及 84. 8 %，篩選正確率為 76. 6 %及 75. 3 %。在米粒幾何部份，利用投影面積分類法，正常粒與碎粒之影像辨識正確率為 93. 2 %。目錄 第一章 前言 [...] . 1 1. 1 研究動機 [...] 1 1. 2 	研究目的 [...] 2 第二章 文獻探討 [...] . 3 2. 1 	白米定義與名詞解釋 [...] 3 2. 2 	米質檢測相關研究 [...] 5 2. 3 	機器視覺應用於農產品相關研究 [...] 7 2. 4 	分類器相關研究 [...] . 12 第三章 基本理論分析 [...] 15 3. 1 	影像基礎 [...] . 15 3. 1. 1 影像 [...] . 15 3. 1. 2 影像傳輸速率 [...] . 15 3. 1. 3 影像存取 [...] . 16 3. 2 	攝影機基本理論 [...] . 16 3. 2. 1 快門速度 [...] . 16 3. 2. 2 打光方式 [...] . 16 3. 3 	灰階校正 [...] . 17 3. 4 	影像處理 [...] . 18 3. 4. 1 二值化運算 [...] . 18 3. 4. 2 旋轉運算 [...] . 19 3. 4. 3 空間濾波運算 [...] . 19 3. 4. 4 形態學處理 [...] . 21 3. 5 	微粒分析 [...] . 25 3. 6 	分類器 [...] . 25 3. 6. 1 決策樹分類 [...] . 25 3. 6. 2 線性識別分析 [...] . 26 3. 6. 3 K值最近鄰居法 [...] 30 第四章 實驗設備與實驗方法 [...] 32 4. 1 	實驗設備 [...] . 32 4. 1. 1 穀粒判別器 [...] . 32 4. 1. 2 取像設備 [...] . 33 4. 1. 3 米粒滑道設計 [...] . 38 4. 1. 4 打光箱設計 [...] . 40 4. 1. 5 穀粒整列器 [...] . 44 4. 1. 6 噴器裝置 [...] . 44 4. 1. 7 系統整合程式 [...] . 48 4. 2 	實驗方法 [...] . 48 4. 2. 1 灰階校正 [...] . 50 4. 2. 2 米粒飛行速度測試 [...] . 54 4. 2. 3 米粒影像資訊處理 [...] . 55 4. 2. 4 顏色分類參數建立 [...] . 58 4. 2. 5 幾何分類參數建立 [...] . 60 4. 2. 6 白米分類測試 [...] . 61 第五章 實驗結果與討論 [...] 62 5. 1 	灰階校正 [...] . 62 5. 2 	米粒飛行速度分析 [...] . 63 5. 2. 1 未使用滑道 [...] . 63 5. 2. 2 使用滑道 [...] . 65 5. 2. 3 結果與討論 [...] . 66 5. 3 	顏色分類分析參數設定 [...] . 67 5. 3. 1 決策樹分類器使用 [...] . 67 5. 3. 2 LDA與KNN分類器使用 [...] . 70 5. 4 	幾何分類分析參數設定 [...] . 77 5. 5 	系統程式 [...] . 77 5. 6 	米粒分類試驗 [...] . 83 5. 6. 1 米粒顏色特徵分類 [...] . 83 5. 6. 2 米粒幾何特徵分類 [...] . 84 5. 7 	結果與討論 [...] . 85 第六章 結論與建議 [...] 87 6. 1 	結論 [...] . 87 6. 2 	建議 [...] . 88 參考文獻 [...] . 89 附錄 [...] . 9...|$|E
30|$|Previous {{study showed}} that grain {{chalkiness}} is occurred {{as a consequence of}} alterations in amylopectin structure (Yamakawa et al. 2007). We found that abnormal starch accumulation was induced by elevated ozone in “Koshihikari” and “Kasalath”. In the japonica cultivar “Koshihikari”, amylose content increased significantly with elevated ozone, although starch content was not affected by ozone (Fig.  3). Distribution analysis of amylopectin chain-length showed a decrease in long side chains of DP[*]>[*] 30 as well as alterations of short side chains of DP[*]<[*] 20 in the kernels of ozone-treated “Koshihikari”. In contrast, amylose content was not changed by ozone and amylopectin chain length tended to increase in both short and long side-chains in kernels of the indica cultivar “Kasalath”. In previous reports, elevated ozone decreased or did not change the amylose content in hybrid indica rice grain (Wang et al. 2012, 2014; Zheng et al. 2013), but there are no reports of the distribution pattern of amylopectin chain length in kernels ripened under elevated ozone. The effect of ozone elevation on starch composition appears to differ between japonica and indica rice cultivars. Interestingly, high-temperature treatment reduced the amylose content of japonica rice, a response differing from that to the ozone-induced change in the kernel amylose content. Moreover, rising temperature during the grain-ripening period resulted in a decrease in short side chains of DP 10 – 19 and an increase of longer side chains of DP 21 – 32 and >  41 (Yamakawa et al. 2007), suggesting that the pattern of alteration in distribution of amylopectin chain length under high temperature differs from that under elevated ozone. Taken together, our results suggest that <b>chalky</b> <b>kernels</b> found in ozone-exposed “Koshihikari” are generated by a novel mechanism that differs from that of the induction of <b>chalky</b> <b>kernels</b> under high temperature.|$|R
40|$|Percentage of grains with {{chalkiness}} (PGWC), one of rice appearance quality, {{varies in}} different rice varieties. A high PGWC results in lowering {{the density of}} starch granules and the grains {{are more prone to}} breakage during milling (Del Rosario et al. 1968). Also, since both longitudinal and transverse cracks occur easily in <b>chalky</b> <b>kernels</b> when the grain is steamed or boiled, chalkiness reduces the palatability of cooked rice (Nagato and Ebata 1959, Hiromoto et al. 2007). Because the Japanese and North Chinese market prefer sticky rice, the rice grains with a chalky appearance are easily recognized and result in low sale prices. On the other hand, rice cultivars with chalkiness are useful for the production of special food, an example of which is sake, a Japanese liquor. So far, the differences in grain chalkiness in different rice varieties are poorly understood at the molecular level. Thus, it is imperative to determine the underlying biochemical mechanism for grain chalkiness, by fine mapping and identification of the major QTLs of PGWC. Previously, a set of chromosome segment substitution lines carrying overlapping chromosome segments of Pai 64 S in a genetic background of elite cultivar 9311 had been constructed by our laboratory (Xiao et al. 2005).

Most of the analyzed 108 genotypes had tryptophan content under the threshold of 0. 075 set for QPM (83. 5 %). However, 50 % had elevated tryptophan content in the range from 0. 065 to 0. 074. High tryptophan content was found in 16. 5 % of the analyzed genotypes, the highest being 0. 088. Only one genotype had quality index over 0. 80 (threshold for QPM).

During the period, milling quality (brown rice percentage, milled rice percentage, and head rice percentage), appearance quality (<b>chalky</b> <b>kernels</b> percentage, <b>chalky</b> size, and chalkiness), and eating and cooking quality (amylose content, gel consistency, peak viscosity, breakdown, and setback) were significantly improved, but the nutritive value of the grain has declined due to a reduction in protein content.

These changes in grain quality imply that simultaneous improvements in grain yield and grain quality are possible through selection.

To {{examine the effect of}} various planting depths in coarse and fine aromatic rice under direct seeding, pot and field studies were executed at University of Agriculture, Faisalabad during kharif 2012. Experiment was comprised of two rice cultivars viz., super basmati (fine aromatic rice) and KSK- 133 (coarse rice) which were sown at various seeding depths viz., 2, 3, 4 and 5 cm using randomized complete block design (RCBD) under factorial arrangement of treatments replicated three times. Results indicated that stand establishment attributes were statistically affected by seeding depth. Increasing seeding depth resulted in low performance of all the yield related parameters. At seeding depth of 3 cm, leaf area indices, leaf area duration, crop growth rate, total dry matter accumulation and net assimilation rate of coarse and fine rice were improved. Likewise, significantly higher yield and its related components were recorded, when crop was sown at seeding depth of 3 cm. This treatment furnished kernel yields of 5. 08 and 4. 23 t ha- 1 in coarse and fine aromatic rice, respectively, which were significantly higher than rest of treatments. Furthermore, at same depth kernel quality was also improved in terms of lower number of sterile, opaque and <b>chalky</b> <b>kernels.</b> Nonetheless, Water absorption ratio was also higher in these kernels.

30|$|Proteomic {{information}} of rice grains in the anthesis, ripening, and maturing stages under heat stress has been gradually accumulated. The anthesis and early ripening stages {{are known to}} be highly sensitive to heat stress. Gel-based proteomic analyzes of different genotype anthers prepared from rice plants treated with high (38  °C) and control (29  °C) temperature at anthesis were carried out (Jagadish et al. 2008). Both cold (19  kDa) and heat (24  kDa) shock proteins were significantly up-regulated in a heat-tolerant genotype N 22, these possibly contributing to the greater heat tolerance of N 22. Heat stress (35 / 30  °C day/night) during an early stage of caryopsis development reduced the expression of starch granule-bound starch synthase (Wx) and prolamin, but enhanced the expression of dnaK-type hsp 70 and glutelins in comparison with those in control temperature (30 / 25  °C) (Lin et al. 2005). In addition, heat stress response of several different cultivars including high-chalky types were analyzed, the results showing that sHSP was positively correlated with the appearance of <b>chalky</b> <b>kernels</b> (Lin et al. 2005). In recent studies, accumulation of all classes of storage proteins was increased at early filling stage under heat stress (35 / 30  °C), whereas the prolamin accumulation was decreased at maturation and desiccation stages (Lin et al. 2010). On the other hand, Lin et al. (2014) showed that up-regulation of proteins involved in starch accumulation and down-regulation of ER proteins, PDIL 2 – 3 and BiP, were observed in the chalky tissue of notched-belly mutant appeared regardless of the environmental stress, employing a comparative proteomic analysis by iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification). Understanding protein expression patterns and its respective posttranslational modifications in chalky grain is of fundamental importance for targeting rice quality under temperatures variability.|$|R
30|$|Rice grain quality, {{influencing}} {{consumer demand}} and international trade, {{is a combination}} of physical and chemical characteristics. The growing demand for high yielding rice coupled with superior grain quality has become more and more urgent in rice breeding (Fitzgerald et al. 2009; Sreenivasulu et al. 2015). Generally speaking, grain quality has four major aspects, appearance, cooking, milling and nutrition quality. Preferences for some of the quality characteristics vary across countries and regions (Calingacion et al. 2014), but consumers prefer rice with uniform shape and translucent endosperm, therefore appearance quality (head rice, grain shape and chalkiness) directly affects consumer acceptance (Zhao and Fitzgerald 2013). Amylose content (AC) is the most important chemical characteristic determining eating quality and affecting some physical traits. AC was also reported to associate with chalkiness in large size of breeding lines or varieties in some studies (Zhou et al. 2015 a, b). Starch granules in the chalky, opaque areas are loosely packed, and <b>chalky</b> <b>kernels</b> of the same genotype has less AC compared with the translucent rice kernels (Lisle et al. 2000; Patindol and Wang, 2003). Amylopectin might be involved as well (Ong and Blanshard, 1995). Amylose and amylopectin are the two major components of rice grain, which are biosynthesized by four major classes of starch synthesis enzymes, i.e., ADP-Glucose pyrophosphorylase, starch synthase, starch branching enzymes and starch de-branching enzymes (Hirose and Terao, 2004; Ohdan et al. 2005). Grain width (GW) had positive and high correlation with chalkiness (Adu-Kwarteng et al. 2003; Raju and Srinivas, 1991; Zhou et al. 2015 a). GW also had the negative effects on AC but positive effects on gel consistency (GC), while grain length (GL) and length width ratio (LWR) were positively correlated with AC but negatively with GC (Xu et al. 2004).|$|R

The results {{presented in this paper}} {{are a part of the}} Maize Research Insitute project on conversion of normal maize lines to QPM lines adapted for growing in temperate regions trough marker assisted backcross (MAB). Genetic and biochemical variability was analyzed between normal (ZPL 5) and QPM (CML 144) parental inbred lines and the efficiency of the three opaque 2 specific SSR markers was examined. Markers phi 057 and umc 1066 can discriminate homozygous and heterozygous backcross progeny, thus can be used as foreground selection markers for the opaque 2 gene. The genetic similarity between analyzed lines was 0. 05, which confirmed good selection of parental lines for the creation of hybrids. Tryptophan content was 0. 093 and QI was 0. 85 in CML 144, approximately twice as high compared to 0. 054 and 0. 48 in ZPL 5. Both tryptophan and QI values for CML 144 were above the QPM treshold, i. e. tryptophan for 24 % and QI for 0. 625 %, making it a suitable donor line of o 2.

30|$|As to the {{possible}} mechanisms explaining the high content of chalky grains in 2010, {{it is worth}} {{to note that the}} levels of some glutathione redox isoforms in oCG 2010 were, all of them, higher than oCG 2009 (Fig.  3 c). Glutathione, implicated in the antioxidant defense through the ascorbate/GSH cycle, {{plays a key role in}} maintaining the homeostasis of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are ubiquitous enzymes encoded by a large family of genes, which play an important role in cellular detoxification to a wide variety of endobiotic and xenobiotic substrates by conjugating the tripeptide glutathione. GSTs have been found to be differentially regulated by dehydration (Bianchi et al. 2002). However, antioxidant systems cannot completely prevent the deleterious effects of ROS. In this study, nine of the identified proteins are implicated in redox homeostasis-related functions in chalky grains, including glutathione transferase (GT), GSTs and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Therefore, this would indicate that the ROS scavenging system may be activated in rice <b>chalky</b> <b>kernels</b> to alleviate such oxidative damage and to enhance high-temperature tolerance, mostly in 2010. Two proteins, GPX and GST, which are involved in the glutathione-ascorbate cycle for removing H 2 O 2, showed the same expression patterns (Figs.  3 c). GST and GPX can reduce H 2 O 2 to its corresponding hydroxyl compounds to remediate oxidative membrane damage, and their expression showed the increases in abundance in chalky tissues. Some of these proteins were consistent with those observed in the rice (Lin et al. 2014) and maize (Luo et al. 2010) in response to stress in developing kernel tissues. Thus, our results, in conjunction with those previously reported (Liu et al. 2010; 2011; Lin et al. 2014), show that the up-regulation of these proteins, more pronounced in high-temperature conditions, suggest a close relation between redox homeostasis and the enhancement of chalky grains frequency. Recent investigation revealed that a heat-tolerant cultivar of rice exhibits a characteristic high expression of superoxide dismutase MSD 1. In addition, the grain quality of transgenic overexpressor plants with the maize Ubiquitin- 1 promoter fused to MSD 1 was significantly improved in comparison with the wild type under heat stress after heading (Shiraya et al. 2015). We infer that the timely enhancement of H 2 O 2 level by MSD 1 under high-temperature stress is probably important, which acts as a signal that rapidly can promote the expression of stress-response proteins (Shiraya et al. 2015; Mitsui et al. 2016).|$|R
30|$|HSPs {{can be used}} to {{stabilize}} protein conformation, prevent aggregation, and, therefore, maintain non-native proteins in a competent state for subsequent refolding in plants under heat stress (Morimoto 2002; Wang et al. 2004; Zi et al. 2013). The significant up-regulation of the HSPs is {{a key part of the}} heat shock response and is induced primarily by heat shock factors (HSFs) such as temperatures variability, drought, salinity, cold and chemicals (Scarpeci et al. 2008; Al-Whaibi 2011; Liao et al. 2013). Among the HSPs illustrated in this study, the amount of the HSP 81 – 1, HSP 81 – 3, and 70  kDa HSP involved strong up-regulated in oCG 2010 -hot season-, while they were down-regulated in oCG 2009 -moderate temperature season-. The HSP 70 family, group of molecular chaperones, such as BiP 1 and BiP 2 maintains polypeptides in an unfolded state (Lin et al. 2014). There is evidence that changes in BiP protein levels induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, and BiP overexpression affects the accumulation of seed storage proteins and, then, results in an opaque phenotype in the whole endosperm of rice (Yasuda et al. 2009). In addition, small heat-shock protein (sHSPs) encoding genes (HSP 16.9 A, HSP 17.9 A, HSP 18.1) were up-regulated in oCG 2010, although the oCG 2009 moderately accumulated these sHSP (Fig.  3 b). Among the various plant Hsps (i.e. HSP 100, HSP 90, HSP 70, and HSP 20), sHSPs have been identified to expressed in maximal amounts under high-temperature stress. They are also up-regulated in rice caryopses during the grain milky stage (Lin et al. 2005; Liao et al. 2013). Our data were supported by a number of previous studies. HSP 70 was reported to potentially be involved in a repair function after desiccation rather than biochemical stabilization in the dry state for Richtersius coronifer (Zi et al. 2013), whereas sHSPs associate with nuclei, cytoskeleton, and membranes, and as molecular chaperones they bind partially denatured proteins, thereby preventing irreversible protein aggregation during stress. sHSPs were positively correlated with the appearance of <b>chalky</b> <b>kernels</b> (Lin et al. 2005). In corroboration with another report (Das et al. 2015), the present results support the view that the induction of sHSPs suggests their function in re-establishing normal protein confirmation and thus cellular homeostasis. Besides, this study revealed that the high temperature in 2010 (+[*]~[*] 4  °C) increased the abundance of high molecular weight HSPs. The HSP 81.3 and 81.1, of the HSP 90 gene family, are associated with different polypeptides serving a general mode of cellular activities. Moreover, the expression of the HSP 90 genes and mRNA accumulation in plants and calli were strongly induced by high temperature (Milioni and Hatzopoulos 1997). HSP data indicate that the HSP 90 (HSP 81 - 1, HSP 81 - 3) and 70  kDa HSP may play an important role at the chalky tissue formation. It is believed that this diversification of HSP reflects an adaptation to tolerate the heat stress in chalky rice grains. Moreover, the physiological role of chaperones like HSP 90 in plants remains poorly understood. Needless to say, further research will be necessary to study the possible positive correlation between the encoding proteins of high molecular HSPs and chalky endosperm.|$|R

Two field studies were conducted during 2008 - 09 to monitor N-Zn dynamics under alternate wetting and drying (AWD) and direct seeded aerobic rice (DSR) {{in comparison to}} conventional transplanting (TPR). It comprised of application of recommended N (143 kg ha- 1) {{in two or three}} splits and soil or foliar Zn (25 kg ha- 1; ZnSO 4, 21 %) at basal or transplanting, tillering and panicle initiation in experiment No. 1 & 2 for each of the rice system respectively. Crop response in terms of soil N and Zn, plant uptake, improved growth, chlorophyll contents, yield and quality was better in 2008 than 2009. Soil NH 4 +-N or NO 3 [...] N contents, total plant N and its translocation into leaf, stem and panicles was high with application of three (1 / 2 basal+ 1 / 4 tillering+ 1 / 4 anthesis) or 1 / 3 (at basal+tillering+ anthesis) and two N splits (1 / 2 basal+ 1 / 2 anthesis) than other splits in TPR, AWD and DSR during both seasons respectively. Total dry matter accumulation, LAI, pre and post-anthesis LAD, CGR and NAR were also higher in DSR with two equal (1 / 2) splits (basal+anthesis) and were followed by TPR and AWD for three splits (1 / 2 basal+ 1 / 4 tillering+ 1 / 4 anthesis) during 2008. During 2009, total dry matter accumulation was high in DSR and was followed by TPR and AWD while Chl contents, LAI, LAD, CGR and NAR were higher in TPR followed by AWD and DSR with three or two equal (1 / 3) splits at (basal+tillering+ anthesis) or transplanting+tillering and Â½ (basal+ anthesis) in TPR, AWD and DSR respectively. Improved N nutrition with three or two splits resulted in increased leaf water potential with greater osmotic potential and high turgor maintenance in 2008 than 2009 with lower values of plant water relations. Similar response was found for improved yield and yield components Nonetheless, effect on 1000 -kernel weight in 2008 and sterile spikelets were non-significant in 2009 respectively. Kernel and straw yields while harvest index were also higher with application of three or two equal N splits in DSR, TPR and AWD in 2008 while response was opposite in 2009 with order of increase in straw and kernel yield and harvest index in TPR>AWD>DSR respectively. Regarding kernel quality, effect for abortive and <b>chalky</b> <b>kernels</b> was non-significant among the production systems in 2008. However, percentage of opaque, <b>chalky</b> and abortive <b>kernels</b> was high in DSR decreasing normal kernel percentage in both seasons than AWD and TPR with improved kernel quality. Kernel length in both seasons while kernel width was nonsignificant during 2008 and 09 respectively with significant interaction and kernel water absorption ratio, kernel proteins were high with low amylose contents with three or two N split applications in all three cultivation systems. High water productivity was observed in AWD and DSR than TPR during 2008 and for AWD in 2009 with two or three splits. Due to increased kernel yield, farmerâ€™s profitability in terms of benefit: cost benefit ratio was also high with three or two splits in TPR, AWD and DSR during both seasons. In case of experiment No. 2, soil Zn application at tillering or panicle initiation increased the plant or soil Zn contents in TPR, AWD and DSR respectively during 2009 and increased Zn distribution from leaves or stem towards panicle in comparison to high soil and plant Zn contents with soil application at transplanting and tillering in AWD and DSR while for foliar applied Zn in TPR respectively. Soil applied Zn at seeding in DSR also increased crop field emergence while high dry matter accumulation, Chl contents, LAI, pre- and post-anthesis LAD, CGR and NAR was the result of soil applied Zn at tillering and transplanting in AWD and DSR while for foliar applied Zn in TPR during 2008. However, soil Zn application at tillering or panicle initiation resulted in better crop growth in all three rice systems in 2009. Similar trend was observed for yield and yield components and spikelet sterility was also reduced with soil Zn application at transplanting and tillering or foliar applied Zn at panicle initiation in AWD, DSR and TPR during 2008 than 2009. Straw and kernel yield and harvest index were also high during 2008 than 2009 with similar response among the rice systems. Zn application at these stages also improved the plant water status with maintenance of high turgor. Soil Zn application improved the filled kernels percentage with reducing spikelet sterility and improved kernel, length width and kernel water absorption ration and protein contents while reduced amylose contents. However, response was more pronounced in DSR with soil Zn application. Crop water productivity was also for soil applied Zn at tillering or panicle initiation with benefit:cost ratio when soil Zn was applied at these stages due to increased crop yield. It is concluded that for better crop growth, yield response and profitability application of N in three splits (1 / 2 at basal/transplanting+ 1 / 4 or 1 / 3 (tillering+anthesis) in TPR and AWD while Â½ at basal + Â½ anthesis in DSR can be recommended. Similarly soil Zn application at tillering or panicle initiation in all three rice systems for increased tillering, reduced panicle sterility and improved yield and grain Zn contents...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{object of}} this project was to study the effect of drying {{temperature}} on physical quality and sensory evaluation of germinated brown rice soaking with tumeric and roselle. The drying was run under the conditions of drying temperatures of 80 - 100 °C and air velocity of 7. 3 m/s. Initial moisture content of brown rice samples was of 54 - 55 % dry-basis and was dried until the final moisture content reached to 20 - 25 % dry-basis. After drying, the rice was tempered and then was ventilated by ambient air until its moisture content reached to 14 - 15 % dry-basis. The experiment showed that highest drying rate is incident at 100 °C. For physical qualities analysis, {{the results showed that}} the drying air temperature does not affect to head rice yield, fissured <b>kernels,</b> <b>chalky</b> grain and color (L*, a*, b * CIE-lab unit) of herbal germinated brown rice. In addition, herbal germinated brown rice drying can maintain low percentage of chalky grain compared to commercial brown rice. The soaking solution was not affect to drying rate.

40|$|Future {{increases}} in global surface temperature threaten those worldwide {{who depend on}} rice production for their livelihoods and food security. Past analyses of high-temperature stress on rice production have focused on paddy yield and have failed {{to account for the}} detrimental impact of high temperatures on milling quality outcomes, which ultimately determine edible (marketable) rice yield and market value. Using genotype specific rice yield and milling quality data on six common rice varieties from Arkansas, USA, combined with on-site, half-hourly and daily temperature observations, we show a nonlinear effect of high-temperature stress exposure on yield and milling quality. A 1 °C increase in average growing season temperature reduces paddy yield by 6. 2 %, total milled rice yield by 7. 1 % to 8. 0 %, head rice yield by 9. 0 % to 13. 8 %, and total milling revenue by 8. 1 % to 11. 0 %, across genotypes. Our results indicate that failure to account for changes in milling quality leads to understatement of the impacts of high temperatures on rice production outcomes. These dramatic losses result from reduced paddy yield and increased percentages of <b>chalky</b> and broken <b>kernels,</b> which together decrease the quantity and market value of milled rice. Recently published estimates show paddy yield reductions of up to 10 % across the major rice-producing regions of South and Southeast Asia due to rising temperatures. The results of our study suggest that the often-cited 10 % figure underestimates the economic implications of climate change for rice producers, thus potentially threatening future food security for global rice producers and consumers...|$|R
