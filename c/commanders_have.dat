5|$|The {{actions of}} both <b>commanders</b> <b>have</b> been {{extensively}} analyzed in this action. While Montcalm performed well during the battle, some tactical options escaped his notice, {{and some of}} his actions in preparing the defenses at Carillon are open to question. In contrast, almost everything Abercrombie did has been questioned. It is widely held among historians that he was an incompetent commander.|$|E
5|$|Since 1 June 1998, station <b>commanders</b> <b>have</b> {{served as}} aides-de-camp to Her Majesty the Queen.

This allowed military personnel to march through the borough in full uniform, an honour {{granted by the}} council in light of 2000 being the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Britain and the 85th anniversary of the opening of RAF Northolt. The neighbouring RAF Uxbridge station had received the same honour in 1960.|$|E
25|$|Just as with hitpoints, {{different}} types of units have different amounts of morale. <b>Commanders</b> <b>have</b> the most morale, and basic infantry usually have the least. Attaching (when possible) a commander unit to basic squads significantly increases their morale. Some weapon types, such as flamethrowers, sniper rifles and artillery bombardment, are especially effective at demoralizing the enemy. Favorable terrain such as craters, ruins or thick jungle give units a defensive cover bonus against both hitpoint and morale damage, while water and swamps will decrease their defensive ability.|$|E

25|$|When {{performing}} {{public order}} maintenance operations (e.g. demonstrations and riots), police personnel wear a helmet in situations with {{increased risk of}} violence. The helmets are white because that colour is easier to spot by cameras and police helicopters. The helmet is plain white for inspectors (rank equivalent to police officer/constable) who function as section members during public order operations. Chief-inspectors (who function as section chiefs) wear white helmets with one blue stripe running from back to front. Commissioners and chief-commissioners (who function as platoon commanders or even squadron commanders and group <b>commanders)</b> <b>have</b> two blue stripes.|$|E
25|$|The {{flight of}} Space Shuttle mission STS-120, {{commanded}} by astronaut Pam Melroy, {{was the first}} time that two female mission <b>commanders</b> <b>have</b> been in orbit at the same time. After completion of her eighth EVA in March 2017, Whitson now holds the records for the oldest woman spacewalker, and the record for total spacewalks by a woman, which was broken by herself again after a ninth and tenth EVA in May 2017, surpassing Sunita Williams, who has completed 7. Whitson's cumulative EVA time is 60 hours, 21 minutes, which places her in 3rd place for total EVA time. She is also the oldest female astronaut ever in space, at age 57.|$|E
25|$|As head of Naval Reactors, Rickover's {{focus and}} {{responsibilities}} were dedicated to reactor safety rather than tactical or strategic submarine warfare training. However, this extreme focus {{was well known}} during Rickover's era as a potential hindrance to balancing operational priorities. One way by which this was addressed after the admiral retired was that only the very strongest, former at-sea submarine <b>commanders</b> <b>have</b> held Rickover's now unique eight-year position as NAVSEA-08, the longest chartered tenure in the U.S. military. From Rickover's first replacement, Kinnaird R. McKee, to today's head of Naval Reactors, James F. Caldwell, Jr., all have held command of nuclear submarines, their squadrons and ocean fleets, but not one has been a long-term Engineering Duty Officer such as Rickover.|$|E

50|$|The {{extended}} battlefield {{noted that}} different <b>commanders</b> <b>had</b> {{different views of}} the battlefield in geographical terms. The brigade <b>commander</b> <b>had</b> to consider actions beyond the immediate front lines, up to 15 km into the enemy's rear where his artillery was operating. The division commander considered the battlefield as far as 70 km out, while the corps <b>commander</b> <b>had</b> a field of view out to 150 km. Starry introduced {{the idea that there}} was not only a geographical dimension to the battlefield organization, but a time dimension as well; the brigade had perhaps 12 hours to respond to actions, while the division had 24 and the corps 72. It was this coordination both in space and time that defined the extended battlefield.|$|R

25|$|The {{soldiers}} of the Sikkim Scouts are trained in the tactics of mountain warfare. As {{the members of the}} regiment are mostly locals, they are expected to be fairly familiar with the skills needed to operate and survive in the mountainous terrain of Sikkim, prior to their enlistment. Their training serves to instruct them in modern methods of warfare and instill military discipline. In an additional advantage to the Indian Army, they are able to obtain information from locals more easily, as they belong to the same culture and speak the same language. Indian Army <b>commanders</b> <b>have</b> expressed the sentiment that in the event of war, members of the Sikkim Scouts and other local regiments from the border would be ready to fight to the end for their home state.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Simpson {{wrote that}} the {{inability}} of the British artillery adequately to respond to the changes of German tactics may have been caused by the supply difficulties in October, when the gunners lacked the ammunition to extend creeping barrages {{all the way to the}} far side of German defences. Guns were worn out, ammunition had three types of propellant with inconsistent characteristics, all the ammunition was damp and corrections for atmospheric conditions were insufficient to regain accuracy, without observation of targets or information on the fall of shot from artillery-observation aircraft. In 2001, Simpson described the process of forming plans by the Fourth Army headquarters to be one of consultation and negotiation with corps commanders, provided that decisions were compatible with the corps artillery plan, which was derived from the army plan. Corps then set boundaries and let divisional <b>commanders</b> <b>have</b> discretion within them. By October corps headquarters were aware of the importance of passing information from contact-patrol aircraft and other sources forward to divisions, the corps headquarters developing into information clearing-houses by the end of the battle.|$|E

500|$|Between the {{aforementioned}} {{carrier air group}} losses, which deprived Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa's ships of their pilots, and losses of experienced land-based attack units like the TAir Attack Force, there remained no real prospect of providing air cover over the Japanese fleet for the coming Battle of Leyte Gulf. Both historians of the battle and IJN <b>commanders</b> <b>have</b> acknowledged this factor as {{the primary reason for}} the Sho plan's failure. H.P. Willmott writes: [...] "In large measure, the Japanese defeat in the Philippines had assumed substance...prior to the landing operations of 17 and 20October. This was the case because of {{the nature and extent of}} the victory won by American carrier air groups in the course of their operations after 10October." [...] Toyoda, when posed the question [...] "What would you say was the primary cause for the lack of success in that operation?" [...] responded, [...] "Our weakness in air, and...the fact that our pilots under Admiral Ozawa were not sufficiently trained." ...|$|E
500|$|For the Australians, the Battle of Isurava has {{sometimes}} been described as [...] "Australia's Thermopylae". The battle has come to form {{a key part of}} the Anzac legend with Kingsbury's actions, as well as numerous other acts of bravery from both Japanese and Australian troops, being highlighted in various accounts of the fighting which have been characterised as part of an epic battle of national survival. In the early post-war years, the efforts of the Australian force in holding up the Japanese for a period of four days were seen as representing a significant feat of arms, fought against a greatly superior force on which the Australians inflicted heavy casualties in a tactically successfully action which delayed the Japanese and allowed the Australians time with which to bring up further reinforcements. While elements of this narrative continue to resonate, recently the magnitude of Japanese losses has been re-evaluated and this analysis has been called into question. As wider strategic goals of the Japanese have been re-cast, and the number of Japanese engaged in the battle has been found to be significantly less than the Australians had thought at the time, the performance of the Australian defenders, and the decisions of their <b>commanders,</b> <b>have</b> also been re-evaluated. Indeed, author Peter Williams, as part of his thesis about the myths of the Kokoda Track campaign, has described the battle as a [...] "defeat with few redeeming features", going on to state that [...] "Horii defeated Maroubra Force but failed to destroy it".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the basic}} {{training}} for newly recruited guerrillas, the guerrilla <b>commanders</b> <b>have</b> to coordinate with the guerrillas assigned as military instructors about their evaluation and performance records.

After this training and parades, the FARC gives its members the title of [...] "Revolutionary of Colombia", establishing the obligation to vow to fight for the goals and ideals of the group and for Colombia, until his or her death.|$|E

2500|$|In a Bangladeshi {{assessment}} of the war, a top Awami League leader, MR Chowdhury, lambasted {{the performance of the}} Indian army. Chowdhury argued that “Never was such a heroic force neglected so much as the Mukti Fouz. The rebels got only ten rounds of ammunition a day, and this was far from adequate. Officers waited for days to get ammunition for a raid. Senior officers lacked weapons, and most of the rebels were short on rations, uniforms, Pakistani cash (necessary for missions inside East Pakistan), tents, soaps, and shoes." [...] Mr Chowdhury further said: “I have seen our (Mukti Bahini) sector <b>commanders</b> <b>have</b> to roam like beggars to procure medicine from various sources for their ailing men. We were assured that the ‘Friends’ (the Indian army) promised to look after the basic necessities of our (Bengali) men, but the bare truth is that our men never get what they require.” ...|$|E

Phillips of Columbia University's Institute for the Study of Human Rights, who compiled a list of allegations and claims accusing Turkey of assisting ISIL, wrote that these allegations [...] "range from military cooperation and weapons transfers to logistical support, financial assistance, and the provision of medical services". Several ISIL fighters and <b>commanders</b> <b>have</b> claimed that Turkey supports ISIL. Within Turkey itself, ISIL is believed to have caused increasing political polarisation between secularists and Islamists.|$|E

He occupied a very singular position {{at the time of this}} battle, such as very few great <b>commanders</b> <b>have</b> ever been placed in; for, as he himself was attached to a Roman army in Spain, having been sent merely as a military messenger to Numidia, he was a neutral in this contest, and could not, properly, take part on either side. He had, accordingly, only to take his place upon the hill, and look down upon the awful scene as upon a spectacle arranged for his special gratification. He speaks of it as if he were highly gratified with the opportunity he enjoyed, saying that only two such cases had ever occurred before, where a general could look down, in such a way, upon a great battle-field, and witness the whole progress of the fight, himself a cool and disinterested spectator. He was greatly excited by the scene and he speaks particularly of the appearance of the veteran Masinissa, then eighty-four years old, who rode all day from rank to rank, on a wild and impetuous charger, without a saddle, to give his orders to his men, and to encourage and animate them by his voice and his example.|$|E
