40|$|Abstract—In today’s quickly {{changing}} and increasingly competitive market place, {{it is imperative}} that manufacturers keep abreast of the technological advances and design innovations incorporated into competing product lines. The term <b>competitive</b> <b>assessment</b> (or benchmarking) has been coined by manufacturers to describe the process of ethically acquiring, inspecting, analyzing, instrumenting, and testing the product lines of other manufacturers. The <b>Competitive</b> <b>Assessment</b> Laboratory at Rowan University is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). In the laboratory, multidisciplinary teams of freshman engineering students from each of the four engineering departments perform each of the above tasks on a consumer product. The laboratory contains a series of consumer appliance test stations featuring PC-based data acquisition systems capable of measuring thermocouple and voltage/current signals. Each station is also equipped with mechanical measurement equipment and portable materials testing equipment. In addition to introducing students to the science and art of design, the <b>Competitive</b> <b>Assessment</b> Laboratory enables the faculty to assess the constantly evolving initial conditions under which the typical engineering student enters his or her course of study.

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{determine}} changes in sport and motor performance of competitors in the category of children’s fitness as a result of conditioning training intervention. We conducted a two-group simultaneous experiment. Experimental group (EG) and control group (CG) consisted of 18 girls competing in the 12 to 15 years old age categories. EG performed supervised conditioning program over a period of 25 weeks with training frequency 3 times per week. Based on the results of physical tests, <b>competitive</b> and expert <b>assessments</b> of sport performance in the children’s fitness category we found significant effect of our conditioning program to increase sport and motor performance in the experimental group. Subsequently, these improvements could lead to success in domestic and international competitions where they occupied the leading positions. Significant relationships (EG = 19; CG = 10) were found between <b>competitive</b> and expert <b>assessments</b> as well as physical tests results, between expert and <b>competitive</b> <b>assessments</b> of physiques and routines. These changes manifested positively not only in the <b>competitive</b> <b>assessment</b> of the physique but also in the expert “blind“ <b>assessment</b> in the <b>competitive</b> discipline of the physique presentation in quarter turns where we observed significant improvements in the EG.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to {{introduce}} the issues of evaluating public tenders generally and in a specific organization, to orientate in methods of multicriteria <b>assessment</b> <b>analysis</b> and by their means, to suggest suitable method of evaluating public tenders for the chosen organization. The theoretical part of this thesis deals with {{the description of the}} process of evaluating public tenders in the Czech Republic, as well as the explanation of multicriteria decision making concept and the description of methods of multicriteria <b>assessment</b> <b>analysis</b> according to the types of information required. The practical part provides the characteristic of the chosen organization, more precisely its divisions. It also provides the regulation that is followed by the organization when realizing competitive tendering. The analysis itself involves the overview of the tenders realized in the scope of activity of the chosen division in the period of five years, as well as the information on the used evaluating criteria. Out of this overview, the sample of the typical tenders is defined, on which the chosen methods of multicriteria <b>assessment</b> <b>analysis</b> are applied. The aim of this process is to assess the order of the variations after the application of the methods of multicriteria <b>assessment</b> <b>analysis</b> and the newly determined evaluating criterion, as well as compare the results with the originally given basic evaluating criterion. Point method, WSA method and TOPSIS method are used for the assessment. In the final part of this thesis, the recommendation on more frequent utilization of multicriteria assessment is suggested to the contract owner, more precisely using such criteria that would be more effective when using public funds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Dredging in a {{contaminated}} river {{has been}} widely accepted {{to have an impact}} on the environment; however environmental risk <b>assessment</b> <b>analysis</b> could be costly, time-consuming and difficult to perform. Therefore, a screening method acting as a preliminary risk <b>assessment</b> <b>analysis</b> to screen potential contaminated areas is necessary. The aim of this study is to demonstrate a new screening method for risk <b>assessment</b> <b>analysis</b> in a scenario where economy, time and simplicity factors had been a concern. The development of this method is based on a variation of standard Ecological Risk <b>Assessment.</b> An <b>analysis</b> will be performed on two elements. Firstly, the level of contaminants in the water, groundwater and air (known as the media) and, secondly the behavior of environmental indicators during monitoring of historical dredging. This analysis is performed in order to establish the degree of contamination in an area that is about to be dredged, in where the publicly accessible contamination level in the media and the historical dredging monitoring data will be utilized. Eight dredged sites in Peninsular Malaysia are selected as the case studies of this research. This research showed that Sungai Perlis has a very high total risk value, which could have a fatal impact on its biodiversity if dredging is performed with negligence at this location. This research could provide an opportunity for Malaysia to increase its efforts to avoid dredging impacts without being constrained on time, cost and simplicity factors...|$|R

40|$|The FCC 2 ̆ 7 s 14 th and 15 th Annual Wireless Competition reports {{review a}} wide variety of evidence, both direct (how firms and {{customers}} behave) and indirect (industry concentration measures) in making its <b>competitive</b> <b>assessment.</b> The reports are silent on how to interpret this evidence. In contrast, modem antitrust analysis relies far more on direct evidence. In failing to put more weight on the relevant direct market evidence to reach an informed <b>competitive</b> <b>assessment,</b> the 14 th and 15 th reports invite erroneous conclusions about the state of competition in wireless markets. The authors are concerned that these erroneous conclusions eventually could adversely influence regulatory policy in wireless markets. Before economists came to rely on direct measures of market power, they relied on indirect measures, such as market share in the relevant markets, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (2 ̆ 2 HHI 2 ̆ 2), and market definitions. The 14 th and 15 th reports downplayed direct evidence of competition-namely, aggressive pricing behavior, robust entry, and continued long-term reductions in price, all of which strongly support a conclusion of 2 ̆ 2 effective competition. 2 ̆ 2 Instead, the FCC focuses on inferences of market power based on market shares. To test the FCC 2 ̆ 7 s presumed relationship between market structure and prices in the wireless industry, the authors analyzed the TNS Telecoms database of cellular telephone bills. The authors found no statistically significant relationship between a household 2 ̆ 7 s monthly wireless bill and the HHI of the economic area in which the household resides. Thus, market concentration {{does not appear to have}} an impact on what the customer actually pays. This finding, along with the fact that wireless prices have declined over time as industry concentration has increased, undermines the structure-conduct hypothesis that undergirds the FCC 2 ̆ 7 s market-share analysis...|$|R
