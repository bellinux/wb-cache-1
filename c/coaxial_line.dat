50|$|However it does {{correspond}} to {{one type of}} measurement of SWR using what was formerly a standard measuring instrument at microwave frequencies.

The electric field strength is commonly measured using a crystal detector or Schottky barrier diode. These detectors have a square law output for low levels of input.

50|$|<b>Coaxial</b> <b>lines</b> are {{the norm}} for {{connections}} between radio transmitters and their antennae, for interconnection of electronic equipment where high frequency or above is involved, and were formerly widely used for forming local area networks before twisted pair became popular for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|Twin-lead {{transmission}} lines have the property that the electromagnetic wave propagating {{down the line}} extends into the space surrounding the parallel wires. These lines have low loss, but also have undesirable characteristics. They cannot be bent, tightly twisted, or otherwise shaped without changing their characteristic impedance, causing reflection of the signal back toward the source. They also cannot be buried or run along or attached to anything conductive, as the extended fields will induce currents in the nearby conductors causing unwanted radiation and detuning of the <b>line.</b> <b>Coaxial</b> <b>lines</b> largely solve this problem by confining {{virtually all of the}} electromagnetic wave to the area inside the cable. <b>Coaxial</b> <b>lines</b> can therefore be bent and moderately twisted without negative effects, and they can be strapped to conductive supports without inducing unwanted currents in them.|$|R
50|$|A <b>coaxial</b> <b>line</b> (coax) has {{a central}} signal {{conductor}} {{surrounded by a}} cylindrical shielding conductor. The shield conductor is normally grounded. The coaxial format was developed during World War II for use in radar. It was originally constructed from rigid copper pipes, but the usual form today is a flexible cable with a braided screen. The advantages of coax are a theoretically perfect electrostatic screen and highly predictable transmission parameters. The latter {{is a result of}} the fixed geometry of the format which leads to a precision not found with loose wires. Open wire systems are also affected by nearby objects altering the field pattern around the conductor. Coax does not suffer from this since the field is entirely contained within the cable due to the surrounding screen.|$|E
50|$|The antenna {{includes}} two conductive spirals or arms, {{extending from the}} center outwards. The antenna may be a flat disc, with conductors resembling a pair of loosely nested clock springs, or the spirals may extend in a three-dimensional shape like a screw thread. The direction of rotation of the spiral defines the direction of antenna polarization. Additional spirals may be included as well, to form a multi-spiral structure. Usually the spiral is cavity-backed, that {{is there is a}} cavity of air or non-conductive material or vacuum, surrounded by conductive walls; the cavity changes the antenna pattern to a unidirectional shape. The output of the antenna is a balanced line. If one input or output line is desired, for example a <b>coaxial</b> <b>line,</b> then a balun or other device is added to so transform the signals.|$|E
50|$|In a {{laboratory}} setting, Lecher lines {{can be used}} to directly measure the wavelength on a transmission line made of parallel wires, the frequency can then be calculated. A similar technique is to use a slotted waveguide or slotted <b>coaxial</b> <b>line</b> to directly measure the wavelength. These devices consist of a probe introduced into the line through a longitudinal slot, so that the probe is free to travel up and down the line. Slotted lines are primarily intended for measurement of the voltage standing wave ratio on the line. However, provided a standing wave is present, they may also be used to measure the distance between the nodes, which is equal to half the wavelength. Precision of this method is limited by the determination of the nodal locations.|$|E

50|$|<b>Coaxial</b> <b>lines</b> confine {{virtually}} all of the electromagnetic wave to the area inside the cable. <b>Coaxial</b> <b>lines</b> can therefore be bent and twisted (subject to limits) without negative effects, and they can be strapped to conductive supports without inducing unwanted currents in them.In radio-frequency applications up to a few gigahertz, the wave propagates in the transverse electric and magnetic mode (TEM) only, which means that the electric and magnetic fields are both perpendicular to the direction of propagation (the electric field is radial, and the magnetic field is circumferential). However, at frequencies for which the wavelength (in the dielectric) is significantly shorter than the circumference of the cable, transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) waveguide modes can also propagate. When more than one mode can exist, bends and other irregularities in the cable geometry can cause power to be transferred from one mode to another.|$|R

50|$|Along {{with the}} {{repeater}} units, most stations utilize duplexers. These are notch filters usually in {{an array of}} six, eight, and sometimes four units. They separate the transmitter and receiver signals from each other so one antenna and <b>coaxial</b> <b>line</b> can be utilized. While this solution is very efficient and easy to install, factors such as humidity and temperature can affect the performance of duplexers, so in most configurations a dryer is installed to keep humidity out of the duplexers and coaxial cable, along with heated buildings in which they are installed in. Excellent quality coaxial cable, connectors, and antennas must also be used, as a single-antenna is not as forgiving as a dual antenna system since any RF leakage or poor connection can greatly decay the reliability and performance of the repeater. In some applications, cables going from the repeater and duplexers must be tuned to mitigate these issues.|$|E
50|$|Solid-state power {{amplifiers}} operating from 1 - 30 MHz typically use {{one or more}} wideband transformers wound on ferrite cores. MOSFETs and bipolar junction transistors are designed to operate into a low impedance, so the transformer primary typically has a single turn, while the 50 Ohm secondary will have 2 to 4 turns. This feedline system design {{has the advantage of}} reducing the retuning required when the operating frequency is changed. A similar design can match an antenna to a transmission line; For example, many TV antennas have a 300 Ohm impedance and feed the signal to the TV via a 75 Ohm <b>coaxial</b> <b>line.</b> A small ferrite core transformer makes the broad band impedance transformation. This transformer does not need, nor is it capable of adjustment. For receive-only use in a TV the small SWR variation with frequency is not a major problem.|$|E

5000|$|Rigid {{line is a}} <b>coaxial</b> <b>line</b> {{formed by}} two copper tubes {{maintained}} concentric every other meter using PTFE-supports. Rigid lines can not be bent, so they often need elbows. Interconnection with rigid line is done with an inner bullet/inner support and a flange or connection kit. Typically rigid lines are connected using standardised EIA RF Connectors whose bullet and flange sizes match the standard line diameters, for each outer diameter either 75 or 50ohm inner tubes can be obtained. Rigid line is commonly used indoors for interconnection between high power transmitters and other RF-components, but more rugged rigid line with weatherproof flanges is used outdoors on antenna masts, etc. In the interests of saving weight and costs, on masts and similar structures the outer line is often aluminium, and special {{care must be taken}} to prevent corrosion.With a flange connector it is also possible to go from rigid line to hard line.

5000|$|The {{behavior}} {{of such a}} system is independent of the operating frequency, but is dependent upon details of the power conductor and its environment. [...] "A nearby conductor other than the line itself may provide a termination point and thereby reduce energy coupled into the TM wave". (This has relevance to Tesla's 1891-1893 table-top demonstrations.) As for any transmission line, at very high frequencies, the increased losses of the metal conductor, despite the advantage obtained using the surface wave mode, are increased, however because conductor losses are inversely proportional to the square of line impedance, this mode can achieve much lower losses, {{no more than a}} few percent of a 50 ohm <b>coaxial</b> <b>line</b> having the same center conductor. The effects of line taps, bends, insulators and other impairments normally found on power distribution systems have been described as [...] "predictable and manageable". Depending on these factors, the resulting insertion loss, along with the transmitted power and receiver sensitivity, will determine the maximum distance attained by such a system. Like CATV systems, an increased end-to-end communications path can be obtained through the use of repeaters.|$|E
5000|$|Stubs may be {{lengthened}} {{in order}} to change from an open circuit to a short circuit stub and vice versa. [...] Low-pass filters usually consist of series inductors and shunt capacitors. Applying Kuroda's identities will convert these to all shunt capacitors, which are open circuit stubs. Open circuit stubs are preferred in printed technologies because they are easier to implement, {{and this is the}} technology likely to be found in consumer products. However, {{this is not the case}} in other technologies such as <b>coaxial</b> <b>line,</b> or twin-lead where the short circuit may actually be helpful for mechanical support of the structure. Short circuits also have a small advantage in that they are generally have a more precise position than open circuits. If the circuit is to be further transformed into the waveguide medium then open circuits are out of the question because there would be radiation out of the aperture so formed. For a high-pass filter the inverse applies, applying Kuroda will naturally result in short circuit stubs and it may be desirable for a printed design to convert to open circuits. As an example, a λ/8 open circuit stub can be replaced with a 3λ/8 short circuit stub of the same characteristic impedance without changing the circuit functionally.|$|E
