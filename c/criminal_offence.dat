5|$|A {{person is}} disqualified from voting in certain circumstances, which include {{engaging}} in acts incompatible {{with being a}} Singapore citizen, being of unsound mind, or being in prison for committing a <b>criminal</b> <b>offence.</b> The constitutionality of the statutory provisions denying prisoners {{the right to vote}} has not yet become an issue in Singapore, though it has been controversial in some foreign jurisdictions.|$|E

5|$|Damage to a {{scheduled}} monument is a <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> and any work {{taking place at}} one of these sites requires Scheduled Monument Consent from the Secretary of State.

5|$|On 1 June 2007 the {{building}} and its curtilage were designated as a protected site {{for the purposes of}} Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The effect of the act was to make it a specific <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> for a person to trespass onto the site.|$|E
5|$|The Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 {{provides}} for Ofcom to issue licences to radio broadcasters {{for the use}} of stations and wireless telegraphy apparatus. The Act sets out a number of criminal offences relating to wireless telegraphy, including the establishment or use of a wireless telegraphy station or apparatus for the purpose of making an unlicensed broadcast. The financing or participating in the day-to-day running of unlicensed broadcasting is also a <b>criminal</b> <b>offence,</b> as is the supplying of a sound recording for an unlicensed station and advertising through unlicensed stations. The Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 allows Ofcom to take a number of actions against individuals committing these offences, including power of entry and search and seizure of equipment. It is a <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> to obstruct a person exercising enforcement powers on Ofcom's behalf. Furthermore, the Broadcasting Act 1990 provides that anyone convicted of an unlawful broadcasting offence is disqualified from holding a broadcasting licence for five years.|$|E

5|$|On February 27, 2008, {{allegations}} surfaced {{that two}} Conservative Party officials offered terminally ill, Independent MP Chuck Cadman a million-dollar {{life insurance policy}} {{in exchange for his}} vote to bring down the Liberal government in a May 2005, budget vote. If the story had been proved true, the actions may have been grounds for charges as a <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> since, under the Criminal Code of Canada, it is illegal to bribe an MP.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the award Braham was out celebrating at a pub. He attempted {{to drive home}} whilst intoxicated and crashed into a traffic island. Although drinking and driving was not a <b>criminal</b> <b>offence,</b> the police charged him with damaging public property and fined him £5, {{the equivalent of a}} weeks wages. It was his third car crash. His success did not abate. A Ju 88 and Do 217 were claimed off the English coast on the nights of the 26 and 31 October 1942.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, H.non-scripta is a {{protected}} species under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Landowners {{are prohibited from}} removing common bluebells on their land for sale {{and it is a}} <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> to remove the bulbs of wild common bluebells. This legislation was strengthened in 1998 under Schedule 8 of the Act making any trade in wild common bluebell bulbs or seeds an offence, punishable by fines of up to £5,000 per bulb. The species is not protected in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} was {{confused by the}} legal position. Disturbing a grave was a <b>criminal</b> <b>offence,</b> as was the taking of property from the deceased. Stealing the body was not an offence, as it did not legally belong to anyone. The price per corpse changed depending on the season. It was £8 during the summer, when the warmer temperatures brought on quicker decomposition, and £10 in the winter months, when the demand by anatomists was greater, because the colder temperatures meant they could store corpses longer so they undertook more dissections.|$|E
5|$|Driberg made {{no secret}} of his homosexuality, which he practised {{throughout}} his life despite its being a <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> in Britain until 1967; his ability to avoid any consequences for his risky and often brazen behaviour baffled his friends and colleagues. Always in search of bizarre experiences, Driberg befriended at various times the occultist Aleister Crowley and the Kray twins, along with honoured and respected figures in the worlds of literature and politics. He combined this lifestyle with an unwavering devotion to Anglo-Catholicism. After his death, allegations were published about his role over many years as an MI5 informant, a KGB agent, or both. The extent and nature of Driberg's involvement with these agencies remain uncertain.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January 2006, the Regional Public Prosecutor in Viborg {{discontinued}} {{the investigation}} as {{he found no}} basis for concluding that the cartoons constituted a <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> because the publication concerned a subject of public interest and Danish case law extends editorial freedom to journalists regarding subjects of public interest. He stated that in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech {{must be taken into}} consideration, and said that freedom of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other human rights, including the right to protection against discrimination, insult and degradation. In a new hearing resulting from a complaint about the original decision, the Director of Public Prosecutors in Denmark agreed with the previous ruling.|$|E
40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis {{deals with the}} states of facts of the <b>criminal</b> <b>offences</b> against road traffic code with focus on the breach of an important obligation. Proving, penalization and use of diversions in <b>criminal</b> <b>offences</b> in the road traffic with respect to its specific features and problems of application are {{also included in the}} thesis...|$|R
40|$|Ecological <b>criminal</b> <b>offences,</b> {{the most}} serious forms of harming and {{threatening}} of environment or its integral parts, represents a global phenomenon of great social hazard. They are often connected with organized transnational criminality, <b>criminal</b> <b>offences</b> against life and bodily integrity, corruption, tax evasion and discrimination. Disputable nature of the subject these incriminations protect imposes a question: “Who {{are the victims of}} ecological <b>criminal</b> <b>offences</b> - individuals, social groups, entire society or environment as value per se?” Perceiving ecological <b>criminal</b> <b>offences</b> as victimless crimes diminishes their importance and the circle of subjects interested to unveil, prove, prevent, suppress and impose punishments for these offences. Therefore, the author discusses the sustainability of the traditional, anthropocentrically defined term of victim in the context of biocentrism and its growing influence on criminal law, criminology and victimology. Attempting to determine whether ecological <b>criminal</b> <b>offences</b> represent victimless crimes, the author analyzes their term, characteristics and significance. Starting from the traditional definition of victim, she analyzes the term of “victimless crimes“ and its (un) sustainability in the context of environmental crime, focusing on its most frequent victims and the necessity of their protection...|$|R

5|$|The boy Jones was an {{intruder}} who gained {{entry to the}} palace on three occasions between 1838 and 1841. At least 12 people have managed to gain unauthorised entry into the palace or its grounds since 1914, including Michael Fagan, who broke into the palace twice in 1982 and entered the Queen's bedroom on the second occasion. At the time, news media {{reported that he had}} a long conversation with the Queen while she waited for security officers to arrive, but in a 2012 interview with The Independent, Fagan said the Queen ran {{out of the room and}} no conversation took place. It was only in 2007 that trespassing on the palace grounds became a specific <b>criminal</b> <b>offence.</b>|$|E
5|$|Under the Internal Security Act, the Minister for Communications and Information is {{empowered}} to prohibit the printing, publication, sale, issue, circulation or possession of any document or publication on the ground, among others, {{that it is}} prejudicial to the national interest, public order or security of Singapore. Doing {{any of the above}} acts in relation to a banned publication is a <b>criminal</b> <b>offence.</b> Among the publications that have been interdicted under this Act are works by Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong, and the Russian political newspaper Pravda. A similar power to prohibit the importation, sale or circulation of publications that are considered to be contrary to the public interest exists under the Undesirable Publications Act.|$|E
5|$|Before announcing UDI to the nation, Smith, Lardner-Burke and the Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont visited Gibbs at Government House {{to inform}} him {{personally}} {{and ask him}} to resign. Gibbs made clear that he would not do so, but indicated that he would vacate Government House and return to his farm. When Beadle arrived later in the day, he not only persuaded Gibbs to stay at the official residence, but moved in himself to provide advice and moral support. On Beadle's counsel, Gibbs instructed those responsible for law and order in Rhodesia to stay at their posts and carry on as normal. When the Governor showed no sign of stepping down, Smith's government effectively replaced him with Dupont, appointing the latter to the post of Officer Administering the Government created by the 1965 constitution attached to UDI. Lardner-Burke asked Beadle to administer the oath of allegiance to Dupont, but was rebuffed; Beadle said he would be committing a <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> if he did so.|$|E

5|$|Elections {{were held}} in May 1963, pitting Kenyatta's KANU against KADU, the Akamba People's Party, and various {{independent}} candidates; the former were victorious with 83 seats out of 124. On 1 June 1963, Kenyatta {{was sworn in as}} prime minister of the autonomous Kenyan government. He was the country's first Prime Minister to come from its indigenous population. Kenya remained a monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. In November 1963, Kenyatta's government introduced a law making it a <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> to disrespect the Prime Minister, with exile as a punishment. Kenyatta's personality became a central aspect of the creation of the new state. In December, Nairobi's Delaware Avenue was renamed Kenyatta Avenue, and a bronze statue of him was erected beside the country's National Assembly. Photographs of Kenyatta were widely displayed in shop windows, and a likeness of his face was also printed on the new currency. In 1964, Oxford University Press published a collection of Kenyatta's speeches under the title of Harambee!.|$|E
5|$|In early 1612, {{the year}} of the trials, every justice of the peace (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to compile a list of recusants in their area, i.e. those who refused to attend the English Church and to take communion, a <b>criminal</b> <b>offence</b> at that time. Roger Nowell of Read Hall, on the edge of Pendle Forest, was the JP for Pendle. It was against this {{background}} of seeking out religious nonconformists that, in March 1612, Nowell investigated a complaint made to him by the family of John Law, a pedlar, who claimed to have been injured by witchcraft. Many of those who subsequently became implicated as the investigation progressed did indeed consider themselves to be witches, in the sense of being village healers who practised magic, probably in return for payment, but such men and women were common in 16th-century rural England, an accepted part of village life.|$|E
5|$|Statutory {{conspiracy}} {{consists of}} an agreement between two or more people to commit a <b>criminal</b> <b>offence,</b> under section 5(1) and (2) of the 1977 Act. For statutory conspiracies, there must be three elements: an agreement, to pursue a course of conduct which involves the commission of a crime, where {{the parties to the}} agreement intended to commit the crime. Even if the parties later decide not to go through with the plan, since the actus reus is to reach an agreement, they can still be charged. There are certain categories of agreement which cannot amount to a criminal conspiracy, however; an agreement between a husband and wife is not a conspiracy, under section 2(2)(a) of the 1977 Act, and neither is an agreement with a person under the age of criminal responsibility, or with the intended victim of the crime.|$|E
