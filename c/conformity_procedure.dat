40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} use of technical regulations as instruments of commercial policy {{in the context of}} multilateral, regional, and global trade. These nontariff barriers are of special concern to developing countries, which may bear additional costs in meeting mandatory standards. Many industrial and developing countries express frustration with regulations that vary across their export markets, require duplicative <b>conformity</b> <b>procedures,</b> and are continually revised to exclude imports. The authors provide a comprehensive overview of the policy debate and methodological issues surrounding product standards and technical barriers to trade. They begin with a review of the policy context driving demand for empirical analysis of standards in trade, then provide an analytical overview of the role of standards and their relationship to trade. They then review methodological approaches that have been used to analyze standards and theirimpact on trade. Their main interest lies in advancing techniques that are practical and may be fruitfully extended to the empirical analysis of regulations and trade. They discuss concrete steps that could be taken to move forward a practical, policy-relevant program of empirical research. Such steps would include: a) administering firm-level surveys in developing countries; b) devising methods for assessing how much standards restrict trade; and c) establishing econometric approaches that could be applied to survey and microeconomic data, to improve understanding of the role of standards in exports.

This paper reviews the negotiating history of China's accession with special emphasis on the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which deals with standards and technical regulations as well as <b>conformity</b> assessment <b>procedures.</b> Because of the unique domestic system in China, the negotiations regarding the TBT Agreement posed special difficulties both for China and the existing Members of the WTO.

40|$|The WTO {{stipulates}} in the TBT Agreement {{that countries}} shall not create unnecessary obstacles to trade. Since differences in technical regulations, standards, {{as well as}} <b>conformity</b> assessment <b>procedures</b> create possibilities of preventing the free movement of goods, members have agreed to use international standards {{as a basis for}} these measures. Conclusions of FTAs are increasing as a strategy to facilitate international trade. Accordingly, measures to alleviate technical barriers to trade by means of FTAs are being increasingly implemented. There is a necessity to evaluate standardization policies that include aspects of technical regulations, standards and <b>conformity</b> assessment <b>procedures</b> considering that agreements finalized in the FTAs are based on the domestic policies of contracting parties. For instance, EU’s standardization policy is significant in regards to the effectuation of the Korea-EU FTA. The standardization policy of the EU evolved from the old approach through the new approach that harmonized standards within the region to the global approach that promotes the international standardization of European standards. EU’s policy which concentrates on harmonization based on international standards following the global approach was reflected in the articles of Korea-EU FTA. In the area of electronics and motor vehicles, Korea was required to harmonize its standards to the relevant international standards and in regards to conformity assessment, it was ultimately agreed that Korea implement the EU-type SDoC. Implications for countries that are expected to finalize an FTA with the EU are centered in the international standardization of national or regional standards to tackle EU standardization policy...|$|R
