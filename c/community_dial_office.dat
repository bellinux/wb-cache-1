50|$|When announced, the DTMF {{technology}} {{was not immediately}} available on all switching systems. The circuits of subscribers requesting the feature often had to be moved from older switches that supported only pulse dialing to a newer crossbar, or later an electronic switching system, requiring the assignment of a new telephone number which was billed at a higher monthly rate. <b>Community</b> <b>dial</b> <b>office</b> subscribers would often find the service initially unavailable as these villages were served by a single unattended exchange, often step by step, with service from a foreign exchange impractically expensive. Rural party line service was typically based on mechanical switching equipment {{which could not be}} upgraded.|$|E
25|$|In {{rural areas}} some smaller {{switching}} facilities, such as <b>community</b> <b>dial</b> <b>offices</b> (CDOs), were housed in prefabricated metal buildings. These facilities almost always had concrete floors. The hard surfaces reflected sounds.|$|R
5000|$|On June 29, 1922, Syracuse's first <b>dial</b> {{telephone}} <b>office</b> {{was opened}} with the designation [...] "Syracuse 2" [...] {{and more than}} 4,700 telephones. The city became the first multi-office point to have dial service. By February 1926, the second <b>dial</b> <b>office,</b> [...] "Syracuse 3," [...] was implemented. At that same time, the James Exchange was retired.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the 1918 merger, Home had 60,000 {{customers}} served from 16 <b>dial</b> <b>offices.</b> Sunset had 68,000 subscribers served from nine manual offices. Home's operations were sizable and the public felt Home provided better service than Sunset, so Pacific Telephone didn't convert the <b>dial</b> <b>offices</b> to manual as it had in the past. Instead, they took the highly unusual step of adding a dial and trunk lines to every manual switchboard position. In this way, former Sunset customers could reach the former Home subscribers via their central office operator.|$|R
50|$|In most areas, one carrier held a {{monopoly}} on local service. The landline telephone system was originally constructed in an era before transistorisation, remote concentrators or cabinetisation. Individual lines from subscribers ran not to a remote concentrator but directly to the nearest village <b>community</b> <b>dial</b> <b>office,</b> to be terminated at an automated mechanical switch or manual exchange. To keep subscriber loop wiring requirements manageable, local exchanges were built in each tiny hamlet. Rural subscribers often made do with party line service. Each village was a separate rate center for long-distance calls and each had its own block of ten thousand numbers (the largest that reasonably could fit on a small-town manual cord switchboard with a jack and indicator for each line). In most small villages, many of these numbers would remain unused. In large cities, multiple exchanges were created to cover individual districts or neighbourhoods; each had its own series of distinctive prefixes, and multiple blocks of ten thousand numbers each. The first few digits of a number uniquely identified a village, a town or a neighbourhood of a big city.|$|E
5000|$|The Very Compact Digital Exchange (VCDX) was {{developed}} with the 5ESS-2000, and marketed to mostly non-Bell telephone companies as an inexpensive, {{effective way to}} offer ISDN and other digital services in an analog switching center. This avoided the capital expense of retrofitting the entire analog switch into a digital one to serve all of the switch's lines when many wouldn't require it and would remain POTS lines. An example would be the (former) GTE/Verizon Class-5 telephone switch, the GTD-5 EAX. Like the Western Electric 1ESS/1AESS, it served mostly medium to large wire centers. The standalone VCDX was also capable of serving as a switch for very small wire centers (a CDX- <b>Community</b> <b>dial</b> <b>office)</b> of fewer than ~400 lines. However, for small wire centers, 400-4000 lines, that function was usually served by RSM's, a 5ESS [...] "Remote SM". The RSM is controlled over redundant and diverse fiber optic [...] "umbilicals". An RSM can {{have more than one}} SM, and also many other peripheral units that are part of a full 5ESS switch. An RSM can serve parts of a larger metro area, but is more often used as a Class-5 wire center for small to medium towns hosted from a 5ESS located in a larger city.The VCDX was also used as a large private branch exchange (PBX). The standalone VCDX has a single Switching Module, and no Communications Module. Its Sun Microsystems SPARC workstation runs the UNIX-based Solaris (operating system) that executes a 3B20/21D processor MERT OS emulation system, acting as the VCDX's Administrative Module. The VCDX uses the CO's normal telephone power sources (which are very large uninterruptible power supply's), and has connections to the CO Digital cross connect system for T1 access, etc.|$|E

25|$|The {{panel system}} was {{designed}} to interconnect the offices of a city or a local calling area. Each office was assigned a two- (later three) digit <b>office</b> code. Callers <b>dialed</b> the <b>office</b> code followed by the station number. In most situations this led to six-digit (later seven) numbers. But from the beginning the panel system handled seven-digit numbers (later eight), for two reasons. Party line numbers were listed {{with one of the}} letters J, M, R, and W following the line number. The caller <b>dialed</b> the <b>office</b> code, the line number, and the digit corresponding to the letter. The panel system {{was designed to}} work with manual offices of up to 10,500 lines. To call a line in a manual <b>office,</b> callers <b>dialed</b> the <b>office</b> code followed by the line number, just as they would when calling a number in a fully automatic office. For lines 10,000 and up, callers therefore <b>dialed</b> the <b>office</b> code and a five-digit line number.|$|R
50|$|The {{company had}} 1,500 {{employees}} by 1928 and served 43,000 telephones in the 90 sq mi Syracuse area. The building at State and Fayette Streets was opened, with equipment for 100,000 dial telephones. In succeeding months, additional central offices went into service, making {{the city the}} largest city to have 100 percent dial service. Buildings to house the additional <b>dial</b> <b>offices</b> were constructed at 4725 South Salina Street and in Draper Avenue.|$|R
5000|$|San Francisco {{continued}} to install manual offices throughout the 1920s. When PT&T {{took over the}} operations of its San Francisco and Oakland competitor, Home Telephone Co., in the early 1920s, their customers were switched from Home's dial service to Pacific Telephone manual exchanges. [...] A 1927 Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. publication proudly describes the company's newest manual offices, without a word of plans to introduce dial service. [...] San Francisco's first <b>dial</b> <b>office,</b> ORdway, opened on 23 March 1929. The first suburban step-by-step (electromechanical stepping switch) office opened in Palo Alto in 1929.|$|R
50|$|The usual seven-digit US {{telephone}} number {{consists of a}} three-digit office code and a four-digit line number within the given office. After a caller in a panel <b>office</b> <b>dialed</b> the <b>office</b> code, the sender looked up the type of the called office (panel, manual, etc.), and whether PCI was to be used.

50|$|In several cases, overlay {{plans were}} {{implemented}} {{on a special}} case basis to implement specialised dialing plans. In some areas, a party in one area code could <b>dial</b> an <b>office</b> prefix which was local, but in a different area code, with only 7 digits. If they were calling a distant office prefix {{in the same area}} code, they would either have to dial 1 and the number or 1+area code+number.|$|R
50|$|Also, {{when the}} panel office was designed, many people used party lines. Party line numbers were listed with a J, M, R, or W {{following}} the line number. The caller <b>dialed</b> the <b>office</b> code, the line number, and the digit {{corresponding to the}} letter. Party letters replace the ten-thousands digit described above. That is, PCI sends the letter followed by the four-digit line number. So party letters and line numbers above 10,000 can't be used together.|$|R

50|$|The {{corresponding}} {{service to}} DID for outgoing calls from a PBX {{to the central}} office exchange is called direct outward dialing (DOD) or Direct <b>Dial</b> Central <b>Office</b> (DDCO). This service is often combined with DID service and allows direct dialing of global telephone numbers by every extension covered by the service without the assistance of an operator. The caller line identification (CLI) or caller-id of extensions for outgoing calls is often set to the extension DID number, but may be the organization's central switch board number.|$|R
5000|$|If {{a manual}} {{exchange}} {{did not have}} call indicator equipment but did have a published numeric exchange prefix, incoming calls from automatic exchanges would be prompted manually with [...] "Number, please?" [...] {{after the first few}} digits (or, in fixed-length store-and-forward systems like the UK director exchanges, the entire number) had already been <b>dialed.</b> In adjacent <b>communities,</b> a <b>dial</b> subscriber would often need to call the neighboring community. The directory would often instruct him to dial a single digit, such as seven, which would connect to the incoming manual operator for the neighboring community.|$|R
50|$|Trunk {{lines are}} used for {{connecting}} a private branch exchange (PBX) to a telephone service provider. When needed {{they can be used}} by any telephone connected to the PBX, while the station lines to the extensions serve only one station telephones. Trunking saves cost, because there are usually fewer trunk lines than extension lines, since it is unusual in most offices to have all extension lines in use for external calls at once. Trunk lines transmit voice and data in formats such as analog, T1, E1, ISDN or PRI. The dial tone lines for outgoing calls are called DDCO (Direct <b>Dial</b> Central <b>Office)</b> trunks.|$|R

50|$|In {{business}} telephony, {{a telephone}} extension may {{refer to a}} phone on an internal telephone line attached to a private branch exchange (PBX) or Centrex system. The PBX operates much as a community switchboard does for a geographic telephone numbering plan and allows multiple lines inside the office to connect without each phone requiring a separate outside line. In these systems, one usually has to dial a number (typically 9 in North America, 0 in Europe) to tell the PBX to connect with an outside landline (also called DDCO, or Direct <b>Dial</b> Central <b>Office)</b> to <b>dial</b> an external number. Within the PBX, the user merely dials the extension number to reach any other user directly. For inbound calls, a switchboard operator or automated attendant may request {{the number of the}} desired extension or the call may be completed with direct inbound dialing if outside numbers are assigned to individual extensions.|$|R

5000|$|Before modern {{electronic}} telephone switching systems came into use, dial tones were usually generated by electromechanical means. In the United States, the standard [...] "city" [...] dial tone was a 600 Hz tone that was amplitude-modulated at 120 Hz. Some dial tones were simply adapted from 60 Hz AC line current. In the UK, the standard Post <b>Office</b> <b>dialling</b> tone was 33 Hz; it was {{generated by a}} motor-driven ringing machine in most exchanges, and by a vibrating-reed generator in the smaller ones. Some later ringing machines also generated a 50 Hz dial tone.|$|R
50|$|When built, the {{building}} had its business office on the first floor, with space for customers to transact business with the phone company, public telephone booths, and rooms for long distance calls. The next 12 floors contained telephone equipment, such as long distance switchboards, other special switchboards, and <b>dial</b> central <b>office</b> equipment for the MAin, ATlantic, and BRidgeport central offices. There were also breakroom facilities and a lunch room for telephone operators who were off duty. The 14th, 25th, and 26th floors were mechanical floors. Finally, a tower on the 15th through 24th floors housed administrative offices of the telephone company. There were also three basement floors with power and heating equipment, along with cable vaults. The building measured 346 ft above street level, 42 ft in the basements, and had 26 stories. Many of these stories were somewhat taller than those in office buildings due {{to the size of}} central office equipment. The building had 24000 sq ft of floor space, and housed about 1,000 employees.|$|R

50|$|States {{that were}} divided into {{multiple}} areas were assigned area codes with a 1 in the middle, the second position, while areas that covered an entire state or province, were numbered with the digit 0 as the middle digit. In order to distinguish seven-digit dialing from ten-digit <b>dialing,</b> central <b>office</b> codes were restricted to not having a 0 or 1 in the middle position. This was already common practice, because the system of using the initial letters of central office names did not assign letters to digits 1 and 0. Furthermore, area codes and central office codes could not start with 0 or 1, because 0 was used for operator assistance, and a leading single pulse, i.e. the digit 1, was automatically ignored by most switching equipment of the time. Additionally, the last two digits of an area code could not be the same, so that the assignments N00 and N11 (N = 2-9) were reserved for special purposes, as some central offices had been using them already for special services. The area codes N10 were reserved similarly and most {{were used for the}} Teletypewriter Exchange Service (TWX).|$|R

5000|$|A {{relic of}} these {{differences}} is found in emergency telephone numbers used in various countries; the United Kingdom selected 999 due to the ease of converting call <b>office</b> <b>dials</b> to make free calls.

50|$|The 300 {{series was}} much more than just the Tele. 332. There was a whole range of {{similarly}} designed products. Fieldsets (Tappers), Headsets, Pendant Telephones, Wall Phones and the House Exchange System. Many Private Telephone Companies had sprung up in the UK. As these were banned by law from connecting to external lines, they contented themselves with producing systems for automatically <b>dialling</b> between company <b>offices,</b> within the same building or, via private wires, rented from the GPO, virtually anywhere. The GPO could only do this via PMBXs (manual switchboards), ranging from the 2 to 5 line cordless boards, via the 25 and 50 line plug and cord boards to the mighty PMBX 1A, which, with its modular construction, could be any size a large company might require. The GPO regarded the Private Telephone Companies as a thorn in their flesh and a great loss of potential income. They decided to tap into this lucrative market. Initially they produced a system virtually identical to the competition and called it the House Telephone System. This appeared, from the rear, like a Tele. 332 but the front sloped down and was covered in two rows of buttons, by which a few other, similar, extensions could be called. Like the competition this system was entirely internal and could not connect to the PSTN (Public Service Telephone Network). Unlike the competition, however, the number of extensions which could be incorporated was strictly limited. The GPO tried again.|$|R
6000|$|In 1837 Emerson {{gave the}} Phi Beta Kappa oration in Cambridge, The American Scholar, which {{increased}} his growing reputation, but {{the following year}} his Address to the Senior Class at the Divinity School brought out, even from the friendly Unitarians, severe strictures and warnings against its dangerous doctrines. Of this heresy Emerson said: [...] "I deny personality to God because it is too little, not too much." [...] He really strove to elevate the idea of God. Yet those who were pained or shocked by his teachings respected Emerson. His lectures were still in demand; he was often asked to speak by literary societies at orthodox colleges. He preached regularly at East Lexington until 1838, but thereafter withdrew from the ministerial office. At this time the progressive and spiritually minded young people used to meet for discussion and help in Boston, among them George Ripley, Cyrus Bartol, James Freeman Clarke, Alcott, Dr. Hedge, Margaret Fuller, and Elizabeth Peabody. Perhaps from this gathering of friends, which Emerson attended, came {{what is called the}} Transcendental Movement, two results of which were the Brook Farm <b>Community</b> and the <b>Dial</b> magazine, in which last Emerson took great interest, and was for the time an editor. Many of these friends were frequent visitors in Concord. Alcott moved thither after the breaking up of his school. Hawthorne also came to dwell there. Henry Thoreau, a Concord youth, greatly interested Emerson; indeed, became {{for a year or two}} a valued inmate of his home, and helped and instructed him in the labors of the garden and little farm, which gradually grew to ten acres, the chief interest of which for the owner was his trees, which he loved and tended. Emerson helped introduce his countrymen to the teachings of Carlyle, and edited his works here, where they found more readers than at home.|$|R
