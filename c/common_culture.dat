5|$|Mayapan was {{abandoned}} around 1448, {{after a period}} of political, social and environmental turbulence that in many ways echoed the Classic period collapse in the southern Maya region. The abandonment of the city was followed by a period of prolonged warfare, disease and natural disasters in the Yucatán Peninsula, which ended only shortly before Spanish contact in 1511. Even without a dominant regional capital, the early Spanish explorers reported wealthy coastal cities and thriving marketplaces. During the Late Postclassic, the Yucatán Peninsula was divided into a number of independent provinces that shared a <b>common</b> <b>culture</b> but varied in internal sociopolitical organization. On the eve of the Spanish conquest, the highlands of Guatemala were dominated by several powerful Maya states. The K'iche' had carved out a small empire covering {{a large part of the}} western Guatemalan Highlands and the neighbouring Pacific coastal plain. However, in the decades before the Spanish invasion the Kaqchikel kingdom had been steadily eroding the kingdom of the K'iche'.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century, when the Spanish {{discovered}} the Yucatán Peninsula, {{the region was}} still dominated by the Maya civilization. It was divided {{into a number of}} independent provinces referred to as kuchkabal (plural kuchkabaloob) in the Yucatec Maya language. The various provinces shared a <b>common</b> <b>culture</b> but the internal sociopolitical organisation varied from one province to the next, as did access to important resources. These differences in political and economic makeup often led to hostilities between the provinces. The politically fragmented state of the Yucatán Peninsula at the time of conquest hindered the Spanish invasion, since there was no central political authority to be overthrown. However, the Spanish were also able to exploit this fragmentation by taking advantage of pre-existing rivalries between polities. Estimates of the number of kuchkabal in the northern Yucatán vary from sixteen to twenty-four. The boundaries between polities were not stable, being subject to the effects of alliances and wars; those kuchkabaloob with more centralised forms of government were likely to have had more stable boundaries than those of loose confederations of provinces. When the Spanish discovered Yucatán, the provinces of Mani and Sotuta were two of the most important polities in the region. They were mutually hostile; the Xiu Maya of Mani allied themselves with the Spanish, while the Cocom Maya of Sotuta became the implacable enemies of the European colonisers.|$|E

25|$|While Christians in India do {{not share}} one <b>common</b> <b>culture,</b> their {{cultures}} {{for the most part}} tend to be a blend of Indian, Syrian and European cultures. It differs from one region to another depending on several factors such as the prevailing rite and tradition and the extent of time for which Christianity has existed in those regions. The ancient Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala have a distinctively different culture when compared to Christians {{in other parts of the}} country. Historical ties with the Assyrian Church and assimilation of Indian traditions have contributed to the development of a unique culture among these traditional Syrian Christians or Nasranis of Kerala. The use of ornamental umbrellas for Christian religious festivities illustrates an example of the indigenous character of Kerala's Syriac Christianity.|$|E

25|$|During the Late Postclassic, the Yucatán Peninsula {{was divided}} {{into a number of}} {{independent}} provinces that shared a <b>common</b> <b>culture</b> but varied in their internal sociopolitical organisation. Two of the most important provinces were Mani and Sotuta, which were mutually hostile. At the time of Spanish contact, polities in the northern Yucatán peninsula included Mani, Cehpech, Chakan, Ah Kin Chel, Cupul, Chikinchel. Ecab, Uaymil, Chetumal, Cochuah, Tases, Hocaba, Sotuta, Chanputun (modern Champotón), and Acalan. A number of polities and groups inhabited the southern portion of the peninsula incorporating the Petén Basin, Belize, and surrounding areas, including the Kejache, the Itza, the Kowoj, the Yalain, the Chinamita, and the Icaiche, the Manche Ch'ol, and the Mopan. The Cholan Maya-speaking Lakandon (not {{to be confused with the}} modern inhabitants of Chiapas by that name) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning eastern Chiapas and southwestern Petén.|$|E
25|$|Relative dating {{techniques}} (based on {{a presumption}} that technology progresses over time) suggest that Acheulean tools followed on from earlier, cruder tool-making methods, {{but there is}} considerable chronological overlap in early prehistoric stone-working industries, with evidence in some regions that Acheulean tool-using groups were contemporary with other, less sophisticated industries such as the Clactonian and then later with the more sophisticated Mousterian, as well. It is therefore important not to see the Acheulean as a neatly defined period or one that happened {{as part of a}} clear sequence but as one tool-making technique that flourished especially well in early prehistory. The enormous geographic spread of Acheulean techniques also makes the name unwieldy as it represents numerous regional variations on a similar theme. The term Acheulean does not represent a <b>common</b> <b>culture</b> in the modern sense, rather it is a basic method for making stone tools that was shared across much of the Old World.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{interpretations of}} the {{symbolism}} of grave goods revolved around religion (equipment for the hereafter), legal concepts (inalienable possessions) and social structure (status display, ostentatious destruction of wealth). There was multiplicity of messages and variability of meanings characterised the deposition of objects in Anglo-Saxon graves. In Early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, 47% of male adults and 9% of all juveniles were buried with weapons, {{some of which were}} very young. The proportion of adult weapon burials is much too high to suggest that they all represent a social élite. The usual assumption is that these are 'warrior burials', and this term is used throughout the archaeological and historical literature. However, a systematic comparison of burials with and without weapons, using archaeological and skeletal data, suggests that this assumption is much too simplistic and even misleading. Anglo-Saxon weapon burial rite involved a complex ritual symbolism: it was multi-dimensional, displaying ethnic affiliation, descent, wealth, élite status, and age groups. This symbol continued until c.700 when it ceased to have the symbolic power that it had before. Heinrich Härke suggests this change was due to the changing structure of society and especially in ethnicity and assimilation implying the lowering of ethnic boundaries in the Anglo-Saxon settlement areas of England, towards a <b>common</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E

After Mandela and Fischer were sentenced in the mid-1960s, Gordimer {{considered}} going into exile, but she changed her mind and later recalled [...] "I wouldn't be accepted as I was here, even in the worst times and even though I'm white". Just as Rosa struggles to find her place as a white in the anti-apartheid liberation movement, so did Gordimer. In an interview in 1980, she said that [...] "when we have got beyond the apartheid situation—there's a tremendous problem for whites, unless whites are allowed in by blacks, and unless we can make out a case for our being accepted and we can forge a <b>common</b> <b>culture</b> together, whites are going to be marginal".|$|E
500|$|Though {{at times}} Hazlitt delighted in actors' interpretations of Shakespearean characters, {{and he thought}} some of Shakespeare's plays eminently suited for the stage, he opens the chapter on Hamlet by proclaiming, [...] "We {{do not like to}} see our author's plays acted, and least of all, Hamlet". Here, more than {{anywhere}} else, he sides with Charles Lamb in believing Shakespeare's plays to suffer in stage presentation. Neither John Kemble nor his favourite actor Edmund Kean played the role of Hamlet to his satisfaction. [...] "Mr. Kean's Hamlet is as much too splenetic and rash as Mr. Kemble's is too deliberate and formal." [...] This, he felt, is a play to be read, and he noted that by his time it had already been so often read as to have become part of the <b>common</b> <b>culture.</b> [...] "This is that Hamlet the Dane, whom we read of in our youth". One might say, he observes, that Hamlet is just a character in a play: [...] "Hamlet is a name; his speeches and sayings but the idle coinage of the poet's brain." [...] Yet Shakespeare gives those sayings a reality {{in the mind of the}} reader, making them [...] "as real as our own thoughts." ...|$|E

While salvation was {{the gift of}} Christianity, being saved was not a focus. The Bible was the Holy Book, but {{was not to be}} taken literally, and the Apostles' Creed rather than the Bible was their source of Christianity. Grundtvigians were also nationalists who wanted to [...] "rewaken the Danes in appreciation of their identity", and its founder, Nikolaj Frederik Severin Grundtvig, is quoted for his writing: [...] "first a Dane and then a Christian" [...] in 1848. The Grundtvigians stressed four elects of a [...] "true people": a common land, a common language, a common history and forefathers, and <b>common</b> <b>culture</b> through songs, folk dancing, language, cuisine, etc. Grundtvigians established Danebod to [...] "save the Danes from total Americanization", and the colony's only written and spoken language remained Danish for several decades after its establishment. On Sunday, June28, 1885, the pioneers arranged a festival to celebrate the new colony. The population grew rapidly in the early 1890s, and by the year 1895, 222 people lived in the Danish Colony of Danebod.|$|E
