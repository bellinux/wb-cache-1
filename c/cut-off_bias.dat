40|$|The {{operation}} of avalanche transistors {{in a strong}} RF 1 environment, has been made very reliable by subjecting them to a large bias. The scheme presented here still permits the connection of the individual transistors into a Marx generator circuit. (Submitted to Electronics Letters) Work supported by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission. In the design of spark gap pulse generators, there is a riced for high voltage trigger amplifiers, in order to fire the gap from a low voltage logic pulse. Some power triodes (ML 8533) have been found satisfactory for this purpose; their in-put impedance is {{of the order of}} 100 ohms, and their <b>cut-off</b> <b>bias</b> is approximately 150 volts. Then the problem consists in generating a 15 ~volt pulse into 100 ohms, with a very short delay, and series avalanche transistors have been favored because of their fast rise time, quick response, and power capabilities...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{exclusion}} of participants with invalid accelerometry data (IAD) {{may lead to}} biased results and/or lack of generalizability in large population studies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether demographic, behavioral, and biological differences occur between those with IAD and valid accelerometry data (VAD) among adults using a representative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized U. S. population. Methods: Ambulatory participants from NHANES (2003 - 2004) who were 20 - 85 years of age were included in the current study and wore an ActiGraph 7164 accelerometer for 7 days. A 2 ̆ 2 valid person 2 ̆ 2 was defined as those with 4 or more days of at least 10 + hrs of monitoring per day. Among adults (20 - 85 yrs), 3088 participants provided VAD and 987 provided IAD. Demographic, behavioral, and biological information were obtained from the household interview or from data obtained in a mobile examination center. Results: Differences were observed in age, BMI, ethnicity, education, smoking status, marital status, use of street drugs, current health status, HDL-cholesterol, C-reactive protein, self-reported vigorous physical activity, and plasma glucose levels between those with VAD and IAD. Conclusions: Investigators should take into consideration the potential <b>cut-off</b> <b>bias</b> in interpreting results based on data that excludes IAD participants...|$|E

40|$|Combining an information-theoretic {{approach}} to finger-printing {{with a more}} constructive, statistical approach, we derive new results on the fingerprinting capacities for various informed settings, {{as well as new}} log-likelihood decoders with provable code lengths that asymptotically match these capacities. The simple decoder built against the interleaving attack is further shown to achieve the sim-ple capacity for unknown attacks, and is argued to be an improved version of the recently proposed decoder of Oost-erwijk et al. With this new universal decoder, <b>cut-offs</b> on the <b>bias</b> distribution function can finally be dismissed. Besides the application of these results to fingerprinting, a direct consequence of our results to group testing is that (i) a simple decoder asymptotically requires a factor 1. 44 more tests to find defectives than a joint decoder, and (ii) the simple decoder presented in this paper provably achieves this bound. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a further {{investigation}} of space-exposed samples recovered from the LDEF satellite and the Franco-Russian 'Aragatz' dust collection experiment on the Mir Space Station. Impact craters with diameters ranging from 1 to 900 micron {{were found on the}} retrieved samples. Elemental analysis of residues found in the impact craters was carried out using Energy Dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX). The analyses show evidence of micrometeoroid and orbital debris origins for the impacts. The proportions of these two components vary according to particle size and experimental position with respect to {{the leading edge of the}} spacecraft. On the LDEF leading edge 17 percent of the impacts were apparently caused by micrometeoroids and 11 percent by debris; on the LDEF trailing edge 23 percent of the impacts are apparently caused by micrometeoroids and 4 percent consist of debris particles - mostly larger than 3 micron in diameter - in elliptical orbits around the Earth. For Mir, the analyses indicate that micrometeoroids form 23 percent of impacts and debris 9 percent. However, we note that 60 - 70 percent of the craters are unidentifiable, so the definitive proportions of natural v. man-made particles are yet to be determined. Experiments carried out using a light gas gun to accelerate glass spheres and fragments demonstrate the influence of particle shape on crater morphology. The experiments also show that it is more difficult to analyze the residues produced by an irregular fragment than those produced by a spherical projectile. If the particle is travelling above a certain velocity, it vaporizes upon impact and no residues are left. Simulation experiments carried out with an electrostatic accelerator indicate that this limit is about 14 km/s for Fe particles impacting Al targets. This chemical analysis <b>cut-off</b> may <b>bias</b> interpretations of the relative populations of meteoroid and orbital debris. Oblique impacts and multiple foil detectors provide a higher likelihood of detection of residues as the velocities involved are lower...|$|R
