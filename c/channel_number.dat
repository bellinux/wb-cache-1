25|$|If a gamma {{spectrometer}} is {{used for}} identifying samples of unknown composition, its energy scale must be calibrated first. Calibration is performed by using the peaks of a known source, such as caesium-137 or cobalt-60. Because the <b>channel</b> <b>number</b> is proportional to energy, the channel scale can then be converted to an energy scale. If {{the size of the}} detector crystal is known, one can also perform an intensity calibration, so that not only the energies but also the intensities of an unknown source—or the amount of a certain isotope in the source—can be determined.|$|E

25|$|Parts of a network's {{operations}} {{may also}} be co-located {{with one or more}} of its O For example, production of Global's national newscast Global National is controlled from its Vancouver O CHAN-DT, while CTV's network headquarters are co-located with CFTO at 9 Channel Nine Court in Scarborough, Ontario (the address refers to CFTO's over-the-air <b>channel</b> <b>number).</b> NBC's national network operations in both New York City and Los Angeles are housed in the same facilities as their local stations in the respective cities, WNBC and KNBC, and both of these O are considered flagship stations of the network (conversely, NBC's affiliate news service NBC News Channel is based out of the studios of WCNC-TV in Charlotte, North Carolina, which the network maintains an affiliation with but has never owned).|$|E
25|$|A {{lighting}} designer (LD) {{is familiar}} with the various types of lighting instruments and their uses. In consultation with the director, the DSM (deputy stage manager) and the scenic designer, and after observing rehearsals, the LD creates an instrument schedule and a light plot as well as informing the DSM where each LX (lighting) cue is designed to be triggered in the script, which the DSM notes down in his plot book. The schedule is a list of all required lighting equipment, including color gel, gobos, color wheels, barndoors and other accessories. The light plot is typically a plan view of the theatre where the performance will take place, with every luminaire marked. This typically specifies the approximate lighting focus and direction, a reference number, accessories, and the <b>channel</b> <b>number</b> of the dimmer system or lighting control console.|$|E
25|$|CTV lost {{significant}} {{coverage in}} British Columbia and Newfoundland and Labrador {{at the beginning}} of the 21st century, starting with a major television realignment in Vancouver. In 2000, Canwest Global bought the television stations of Western International Communications, which owned longstanding CTV affiliates CHAN in Vancouver and CHEK-TV in Victoria. A year later, after its CTV contract ran out, Canwest made CHAN the Global owned-and-operated station for British Columbia, taking advantage of CHAN's massive network of repeaters that cover 97% of the province. CTV shifted its programming to CIVT-TV, an independent station it already owned. Unlike CHAN, CIVT has only one transmitter covering the metropolitan areas of Vancouver and Victoria, and has to rely on cable and satellite to reach the rest of the province. CIVT is either carried on a higher <b>channel</b> <b>number</b> or unavailable altogether in the Mountain Time Zone portion of British Columbia, where CTV relies on CFCN or CFRN as its main carriers.|$|E

25|$|Networks in Canada took {{corporate}} branding to its logical conclusion; references to local call signs and <b>channel</b> <b>numbers</b> have almost completely been {{eliminated from the}} O except during station sign-on and sign-off sequences (although some O may occasionally refer to their <b>channel</b> <b>numbers</b> in passing).|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} user habit, Brazilians have defined a code to keep, in the digital format, the same <b>channel</b> <b>numbers</b> used in analogue broadcasting, thus {{making it possible to}} have an analogue to digital transition with maximum transparency.

25|$|At 1:00a.m. on September 10, 1995, WCIX and WTVJ swapped channel positions. The entire WCIX {{intellectual}} unit (CBS affiliation, {{programming and}} staff) moved from channel 6 to channel 4, effectively returning CBS programming to channel 4 after a six-year hiatus. WTVJ had been Miami's CBS affiliate from its sign-on in March 1949 until the 1989 switch to NBC. Along with the frequency change came {{a new set}} of call letters, WFOR-TV, changing the reference to the station's <b>channel</b> <b>number</b> from its original allocation to its new one. Due to the way the asset exchange deal was structured, the two stations were required to swap licenses in addition to the transmitting facilities. As a result, WFOR-TV legally operated under WTVJ's old license on channel 4 {{through the end of the}} analog broadcasting era; however, the studios of both WFOR-TV and WTVJ remained the same at the time of the swap (WTVJ has since moved to a new facility).|$|E

2500|$|To {{read from}} VCSDRAM, after the Active command, a [...] "Prefetch" [...] command is {{required}} to copy data from the sense amplifier array to the channel SDRAM. [...] This command specifies a bank, 2 bits of column address (to select the segment of the row), and 4 bits of <b>channel</b> <b>number.</b> [...] Once this is performed, the DRAM array may be precharged while read commands to the channel buffer continue. [...] To write, first the data is written to a channel buffer (typically previous initialized using a Prefetch command), then a Restore command, with the same parameters as the Prefetch command, copies a segment of data from the channel to the sense amplifier array.|$|E
2500|$|VCM inserts an SRAM {{cache of}} 16 [...] "channel" [...] buffers, each 1/4 row [...] "segment" [...] in size, between DRAM banks' sense {{amplifier}} rows {{and the data}} I/O pins. [...] "Prefetch" [...] and [...] "Restore" [...] command, unique to VCSDRAM, copy data between the DRAM's sense amplifier row and the channel buffers, while the equivalent of SDRAM's Read and Write commands specify a <b>channel</b> <b>number</b> to access. [...] Reads and writes may thus be performed independent of the currently active state of the DRAM array, with the equivalent of 4 full DRAM rows being [...] "open" [...] for access at a time. [...] This is an improvement over the 2 open rows possible in a standard 2-bank SDRAM. [...] (There is actually a 17th [...] "dummy channel" [...] used for some operations.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The signals use similar DSSS {{encoding}} and binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation as in GPS signals. All GLONASS satellites {{transmit the}} same code as their standard-precision signal; however each transmits {{on a different}} frequency using a 15-channel frequency division multiple access (FDMA) technique spanning either side from 1602.0 MHz, known as the L1 band. The center frequency is 1602MHz + n × 0.5625MHz, where n is a satellite's frequency <b>channel</b> <b>number</b> (n=−7,−6,−5,...0,...,6, previously n=0,...,13). Signals are transmitted in a 38° cone, using right-hand circular polarization, at an EIRP between 25 and 27 dBW (316 to 500 watts). [...] Note that the 24-satellite constellation is accommodated with only 15 channels by using identical frequency channels to support antipodal (opposite side of planet in orbit) satellite pairs, as these satellites are never both in view of an earth-based user at the same time.|$|E

2500|$|A network's O often {{share similar}} {{branding}} elements among themselves, reinforcing their common identity as stations {{owned by the}} same network; for example, a common shared element among O stations involves identifying themselves by combining {{the name of their}} parent network with the station's <b>channel</b> <b>number</b> (such as [...] "CBS 2," [...] which is uniformally used by CBS O KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, WCBS-TV in New York City and WBBM-TV in Chicago), which started to become a normal mode of branding in the mid-1990s (beforehand, O of certain networks – such as CBS and NBC – incorporated the network's logo into their own while verbally being referred under a more genericized channel branding). This kind of sharing may also present some savings to the parent network (i.e., the owner), as its O can use the same graphics and music rather than to have each station commission their own individual branding package. Examples include the circle 7 logo (originally designed in 1962 for ABC's aforementioned O, all of which at the time had broadcast on VHF channel 7), the [...] "I Love Chicago (Chicago My Home)" [...] musical signature for local newscasts (originally used by WBBM-TV, and later spread to other CBS O), and the [...] "CBS Mandate" [...] (a set of branding guidelines currently used at several CBS O). Fox also has a set of branding guidelines for both its O and affiliates. Supposedly, NBC and ABC also have branding guidelines for its affiliates, but not as extreme as CBS or Fox; since the 2013–14 season, however, when ABC unveiled an updated version of its logo, all of the network's affiliates are now required to use the ABC circle logo {{as a part of the}} station's own logo, which must additionally be approved by the network for use.|$|E
