5|$|Also, Norway was {{the first}} {{country in the world}} to have all-electric cars topping the new car sales monthly ranking. The Tesla Model S has been the top selling new car four times, and the Nissan Leaf has topped the monthly new car sales ranking twice. In March 2014 the Tesla Model S also broke the 28-year-old record for monthly sales of a single model {{regardless}} of its power source, surpassing the previous record set in May 1986. In July 2016, when new car registrations are break down by type of powertrain, {{for the first time a}} plug-in hybrid, the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV, listed as the top selling new car. In September 2016, the Tesla Model X ranked as the top selling new <b>car</b> <b>model</b> in Norway when registrations are broken down by type of powetrain. The BMW i3 was the top selling new <b>car</b> <b>model</b> in the country in November 2016.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Ford {{tried to}} revive the Continental brand as a {{standalone}} line of ultra luxury automobiles, but abandoned the attempt after the 1957 model year, by which time around 3000 Mark II cars had been built. The failure was {{due in part to}} the price tag of $9695, an extraordinary amount of money for the time. The Continental thereafter became a successful <b>car</b> <b>model</b> under Ford's Lincoln brand.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenery and}} {{background}} of the story was meticulously copied from existing sources; <b>car</b> <b>model</b> types like the Opel Olympia 38 in which Calculus' abductors escaped the police were drawn from real examples, while Hergé closely adhered {{to the reality of}} the port and docks at Saint-Nazaire. Professor Tarragon's house was drawn from a real house in Avenue Delleur, Boitsfort, which Jacobs had identified for Hergé's purposes. Hergé and Jacobs stationed themselves outside the house and completed a sketch of the building. Immediately after, two grey cars containing German soldiers pulled up; the house had been requisitioned by the Schutzstaffel (SS). Hergé realised that, had he and Jacobs been discovered sketching, they would have been interrogated.|$|E

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{consumers}} shifting between different <b>car</b> <b>models</b> on gasoline consumption revealed that in 2005 – 2006 and 2006 – 2007, booms in both compact and hybrid car sectors caused shifts from old ordinary passenger <b>car</b> <b>models</b> to new kei and hybrid <b>car</b> <b>models,</b> respectively. We {{found that in}} 2005 – 2006 and 2006 – 2007 {{the effect of the}} car replacement boom on annual gasoline consumption has significantly increased from − 0.005 % to − 1 % and that the car replacements {{played a crucial role in}} reducing annual gasoline consumption.|$|R

25|$|Deming's {{teachings and}} {{philosophy}} are clearly illustrated {{by examining the}} results they produced after they were adopted by Japanese industry, as the following example shows. Ford Motor Company was simultaneously manufacturing a <b>car</b> <b>model</b> with transmissions made in Japan and the United States. Soon after the <b>car</b> <b>model</b> was on the market, Ford customers were requesting the model with Japanese transmission over the US-made transmission, and {{they were willing to}} wait for the Japanese model. As both transmissions were made to the same specifications, Ford engineers could not understand the customer preference for the model with Japanese transmission. Finally, Ford engineers decided to take apart the two different transmissions. The American-made car parts were all within specified tolerance levels. On the other hand, the Japanese car parts were virtually identical to each other, and much closer to the nominal values for the parts—e.g., if a part was supposed to be one foot long, plus or minus 1/8 of an inch—then the Japanese parts were all within 1/16 of an inch, less variation. This made the Japanese cars run more smoothly and customers experienced fewer problems.|$|E

Healey purchased an Alfa Romeo 8C 2300 and developed a new <b>car</b> <b>model</b> with an Alfa inspired straight-8 engine type named the Triumph Dolomite. Three of these cars were made in 1934, {{one of which was}} used in competition and destroyed in an accident. The Dolomites manufactured from 1937 to 1940 were unrelated to these prototypes.|$|E

25|$|De Freville's first engine {{design was}} a four-cylinder engine with {{aluminium}} pistons and pressure lubrication, which was unusual for that time. The first <b>car</b> <b>model</b> using de Freville's engine was the Alvis 10/30. It {{was an instant}} success and established the reputation for quality workmanship and superior performance for which the company was to become famous. The original 10/30 side-valve engine was improved, becoming by 1923 the overhead valve Alvis 12/50, a highly successful sports car that was produced until 1932. Around 700 of the 12/50 models and 120 of the later Alvis 12/60 models survive today.|$|E

This rolling stock, originally produced by General Electric in two batches (144 in 1972–73 and 100 in 1975–77), was initially branded as the M2 Cosmopolitan, with later versions being made on license by Tokyu <b>Car</b> (<b>model</b> M4, 1988) and Morrison-Knudsen (model M6, 1994). Cosmopolitans can be easily spotted by their red stripe along the side, the presence of pantographs on the lead cars in each set, and a dynamic braking grid on the roof.|$|E
25|$|In January 2014 the Police Service of Northern Ireland {{released}} a statement that a re-examination of the evidence {{from the scene of}} the 1999 murder had revealed new DNA material of a potential perpetrator's presence, and made a public appeal for information, detailing the involvement of a specific <b>car</b> <b>model</b> (a white coloured Hyundai Pony), and a compass pommel that had broken off of a hunting knife during the attack and had been left behind at the scene. In February 2014 detectives from the Serious Crime Branch arrested a 59-year-old man at an address in Newry in relation to the murder, he was subsequently released without charge. In September 2014 the police arrested three men, aged 56, 55 and 42 in County Armagh in relation to inquiries into the murder, all of whom were subsequently released without charges after questioning.|$|E

25|$|Mazda began racing RX-7s in the IMSA GTU {{series in}} 1979. In its first year, RX-7s placed {{first and second}} at the 24 Hours of Daytona, and claimed the GTU series championship. The car {{continued}} winning, claiming the GTU championship seven {{years in a row}}. The RX-7 took the GTO championship ten years in a row from 1982. In addition to this, a GTX version was developed, named the Mazda RX-7 GTP; this was unsuccessful, and the GTP version of the car was also unsuccessful. The RX-7 has won more IMSA races than any other <b>car</b> <b>model.</b> In the USA SCCA competition RX-7s were raced with great success by Don Kearney in the NE Division and John Finger in the SE Division. Pettit Racing won the GT2 Road Racing Championship in 1998. The car was a 93 Mazda RX-7 street car with only bolt-on accessories. At season end Pettit had 140 points—63 points more than the 2nd place team. This same car finished the Daytona Rolex 24-hour race 4 times.|$|E
500|$|Holden re-introduced its defunct Statesman {{title in}} 1990—this time under the Holden marque, as the Statesman and Caprice. For 1991, Holden updated the Statesman and Caprice {{with a range}} of improvements, {{including}} the introduction of four-wheel anti-lock brakes (ABS); although, a rear-wheel system had been standard on the Statesman Caprice from March 1976. ABS was added to the short-wheelbase Commodore range in 1992. Another returning variant was the full-size utility, and on this occasion it was based on the Commodore. The VN Commodore received a major facelift in 1993 with the VR—compared to the VN, approximately 80percent of the <b>car</b> <b>model</b> was new. Exterior changes resulted in a smoother overall body and a [...] "twin-kidney" [...] grille—a Commodore styling trait that remained until the 2002 VY model and, as of 2013, remains a permanent staple on HSV variants.|$|E
