The implemented module consists of a microcontroller as {{the heart of the}} system, two sensors (position sensor, temperature sensor), electronic circuits, and a mechanical system for the longitudinal and vertical motion. An 8051 microcontroller provides signals to control the system and achieves the position of the Bench which is detected by the inductive proximity sensor (M 30, 8 mm, Metal), other function of the microcontroller is to process the data which is handled the temperature sensor (Precision Centigrade LM 35). The <b>calibration</b> <b>Bench</b> module utilizes closed loop feedback system via a proximity sensor which is located on one of the Bench wheels, for a precise movement and accurate bench position. By utilization of digital logic in the form of microcontroller feedback signal, DC motors are used for powering the mechanical system. They are controlled via two H-bridge power FET transistors arrays, which provide the driving power and direction control. While the microcontroller controls the H-bridge through the optisolator. The <b>calibration</b> <b>bench</b> system is designed, implemented, and then tested and the results show small difference in a desired position as compared to the manual adjustment. The accuracy of results is affected by the sensor resolution. The goal of the design is to increase the quality of the calibration process, decrease of exposure time for the personnel (occupational Dose Reduction). Thus good radiation protection introduced as the result of well calibrated instruments, so the implemented module maintains the main objectives of the proposed system and could be applicable for further application...|$|E

40|$|Measurements of <b>calibration</b> and <b>bench</b> {{standards}} {{as well as}} samples of ARG- 1 that were performed by the DWPF Lab during the processing of batches 94 through 263 were provided to SCS for review. Three datasets, one associated with each of three preparation methods (Cold Chem, Mixed Acid, and Fusion) {{were included in the}} review. The review conducted covered several areas of investigation. Biases in these measurements relative to the reference values for the standards including ARG- 1 were estimated and found to be of no practical concern. Percent relative standard deviations for these data also were determined. Sources of variation in the measurements (i. e., batch-to-batch and within process batch) were estimated and compared. An investigation into evidence of instrument drift during a group of measurements representing a prototypical block was conducted for each preparation method using pairs of <b>calibration</b> and <b>bench</b> standards. No evidence of instrument drift at levels of practical concern was seen in these data. Also, the replicates of calibration standards {{at the beginning of each}} analytical block were found to be unnecessary. The uncertainties of the measurements, which incorporated biases and precision errors, were computed for the <b>calibration</b> standards, <b>bench</b> standards, and ARG- 1. The limits for these uncertainties were compared to the current, LIMS operating limits for the errors in the measurements of these standards. These comparisons may provide opportunities for revising the LIMS limits. Comparisons between MFT and SME results were made for both the Mixed Acid and the Fusion prep methods.

40|$|The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) {{located in}} Grenoble, France {{is a joint}} {{facility}} supported and shared by 19 European countries. It operates the most powerful synchrotron radiation source in Europe. Synchrotron radiation sources address many important questions in modern science and technology. They {{can be compared to}} “super microscopes”, revealing invaluable information in numerous fields of diverse research such as physics, medicine, biology, geophysics and archaeology. For the ESRF accelerators and beam lines to work correctly, alignment is of critical importance. Alignment tolerances are typically much less than one millimetre and often in the order of several micrometers over the 844 m ESRF storage ring circumference. To help maintain these tolerances, the ESRF has, and continues to develop calibration techniques for high precision spherical measurement system (SMS) instruments. SMSs are a family of instruments comprising automated total stations (theodolites equipped with distance meters), referred to here as robotic total stations (RTSs); and laser trackers (LTs). The ESRF has a modern distance meter <b>calibration</b> <b>bench</b> (DCB) used for the calibration of SMS electronic distance meters. At the limit of distance meter precision, the only way to improve positional uncertainty in the ESRF alignment is to improve the angle measuring capacity of these instruments. To this end, the horizontal circle comparator (HCC) and the vertical circle comparator (VCC) have been developed. Specifically, the HCC and VCC are used to calibrate the horizontal and vertical circle readings of SMS instruments under their natural working conditions. Combined with the DCB, the HCC and VCC provide a full calibration suite for SMS instruments. This thesis presents their development, functionality and in depth uncertainty evaluation. Several unique challenges are addressed in this work. The first is the development and characterization of the linked encoders configuration (LEC). This system, based on two continuously rotating angle encoders, is designed improve performance by eliminating residual encoder errors. The LEC can measure angle displacements with an estimated uncertainty of at least 0. 044 arc seconds. Its uncertainty is presently limited by the instrumentation used to evaluate it. Secondly, in depth investigation has lead to the discovery of previously undocumented error-motion effects in ultra-precision angle calibration. Finally, methods for rigorous characterisation and extraction of rotary table error motions and their uncertainty evaluation using techniques not previously discussed in the literature have been developed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} acquiring spatial data concerning points {{on the surface of}} structures such as underground tunnels and sewers. These data can usefully provide knowledge of deformation, shape, area, volume, and position of structures. Such data can be further analysed to give insight into clearances, deterioration, flow rates and in-fill volumes or can be used to give knowledge of the present state of structures and their position. Few systems address the problem of reliably acquiring this data {{in a manner that is}} fast and accurate while remaining flexible, adaptable and robust. This thesis considers a solution to the problem of fast and accurate spatial data acquisition concerning commonly found structures using the technique of optical triangulation with a linear array camera and diode laser light source. Optical triangulation is a technique that has not fully matured for medium range measurement with few systems having been developed and little research material produced. However, the research carried out for this thesis shows that providing all the factors that contribute errors of measurement are understood, then a fast, robust and high accuracy system can be developed. The development of the optical triangulation technique for use in surveying was addressed through a programme of prototype development, testing, and refinement. Three prototypes were built that demonstrated the reliability, accuracy, speed and robustness of this technique. The errors associated with the a triangulation measuring system when applied to surveying application is considered from the intrinsic errors which are the same for any triangulation system and the extrinsic errors which are particular to the use of this system in surveying situations. A <b>calibration</b> <b>bench</b> was constructed for consideration of the triangulation system which was automatic and used an interferometer to provide high accuracy measurement of the performance of the triangulation system. Calibration and interpolation trials were conducted and the results analysed. An analysis of the subpixel accuracy achieved with the discrete pixel CCD imagers has been performed and an analysis made. One of the main disadvantages of optical triangulation when applied to the range 0 - 5 metres is that of non-linearity. A method of correction has been developed and analysed which is believed to be novel and makes a significant improvement to the measuring system. The conclusion of this research is that an improved system of measurement has been produced which has a number of novel features. Trials show that the measuring system could be developed commercially to provide a solution to measurements of structures within the range of the device and with greater accuracy than comparable equipment designed for the same purpose...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} laser induced {{fluorescence}} calibration for engine and simulating rigs was studied using both a static calibration rig and a dynamic method involving a modified piston-ring specimen. The technique {{used to measure}} oil film thickness was laser induced fluorescence through optical fibres. Previous experimental {{studies have been conducted}} in test rigs and engines to obtain in-situ results showing the uncertainties lying within every applied method. In this study a comparison of two proposed methods is performed – <b>bench</b> <b>calibration</b> (micrometer based) and dynamic for a single piston-ring test rig application. Engine in-situ calibration was not an option so that uncertainties that follow the direct measurements in the piston cylinder engine assembly and the difficulty in determining the exact properties of the lubricant at the ring-pack, which simultaneously affect fluorescence (e. g. local temperature at point of measurement, lubricant degradation) could be avoided. A temperature parametric study of the dynamic calibration coefficient is also presented and a comparison between results from capacitance transducer minimum oil film thickness measurements and the LIF measurements. The discussion that follows the results, tries to enlighten the reasons behind inconsistencies found between the proposed methods...|$|R

[4] {{studied the}} load spectra of {{high-speed}} train bogies by conducting a long-term on-track test on the Wuhan–Guangzhou passenger line.The research showed that wheel profiling improves the loading {{condition of the}} bogie frame. However, the transfer relation between load and stress was not discussed in the study because of the different working conditions. Zhu et al. [5] conducted a theoretical study on and an experimental validation of elastic dynamic load spectra on the bogie frame of a high-speed train. The computed result proved that the simplified load series is reasonable. The contribution of modal stress to the overall damage is small. However, the overall damage in the line test was calculated with a laboratory <b>bench</b> <b>calibration</b> coefficient. Ren et al. [6] presented methods to measure the axle spring load, trailing arm seat lateral force and dynamic stresses of powered and non-powered bogies of a 350  km/h EMU. The characteristics of the forces and the stresses for the EMU were investigated by Hilbert transform of the sample data. The characteristics of the measured loads are useful to establish load conditions for laboratory tests of bogie’s fatigue assessment. But the relationship of loan-stress has not been given out in the research.|$|R
40|$|Tire {{characteristics}} and behavior are {{of great importance}} in vehicle dynamics since the forces transmitted in the tire-road contact are the main contributors to global vehicle performance. Several research groups {{have focused on the}} study and modeling of tires. Some of the most important factors that need to be known are tread {{characteristics and}} pressure distribution in the tire-ground contact patch. In this work, a test bench has been used to adequately determine the aforementioned factors. The measurement principle of the test bench is the frustration of total internal reflection (FTIR) of light. It makes use of a laterally illuminated glass on which the tire leans. An interposed plastic interface between them causes the reflection of light. Finally, a video camera captures the bright image formed through the glass. The brightness level in each pixel of the image is related to existing normal pressure. A study of the parameters that affect the test <b>bench</b> <b>calibration</b> such as type of interface material used, diffuse light, hysteresis, creep and transverse light absorption is performed. Experimental tests are conducted to relate tire inflation pressure and camber angle to the pressure distribution. Furthermore, the test bench is used to detect and evaluate the influence of defects in the tire on the contact pressures...|$|R
