On other hand customers have stringent demand of fuel economy, high performance at low cost. In {{order to have}} high fuel economy the automotive manufacturers are induced to reduce weight. In this project <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>panel</b> is selected as a target weight reduction component. This can be achieved either using high strength low weight material or by using low weight composite sandwich panel. Aluminum composite (Aluminum skin, polyethylene core and epoxy resin) material being light and strong, it is thought as an alternative material. By using this doubly curve sandwich panel, required stiffness can be achieved with reduced thickness and weight. More over this panel prevents the heat flux infiltration and hence improve air conditioner efficiency. Stiffness and thermal analysis of the panel was carried out using Finite Element Solution. Weight reduction 30. 55 % has been achieved for the same stiffness and 47. 73 % lesser heat infiltration has been observed than that with Aluminum panel...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of car body panels are defective in succession of process fluctuations. Thus the produced <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>panel</b> can be precise or damaged. To reduce the error rate, an intelligent {{deep drawing tool}} was developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU in cooperation with Audi and Volkswagen. Mechatronic components in a closed-loop control is the main differentiating factor between an intelligent and a conventional deep drawing tool. In correlation with sensors for process monitoring, the intelligent tool consists of piezoelectric actuators to actuate the deep drawing process. By enabling the usage of sensors and actuators at the die, the forming tool transform to a smart structure. The interface between sensors and actuators will be realized with a closed-loop control. The content of this research will present the experimental results with the piezoelectric actuator. For the analysis a production-oriented forming tool with all automotive requirements were used. The disposed actuators are monolithic multilayer actuators of the piezo injector system. In order to achieve required force, the actuators are combined in a cluster. The cluster is redundant and economical. In addition to the detailed assembly structures, this research will highlight intensive analysis with the intelligent deep drawing tool...|$|E

40|$|Currently, in the {{automotive}} industry, {{the control of}} noise and vibration {{is the subject of}} much research, oriented towards the creation of innovative solutions to improve the comfort of the vehicle and to reduce its cost and weight. This thesis fits into this particular framework, as it aims to investigate the possibility of integrating the functions of sound absorptioninsulation and vibration damping in a unique component. At present the bituminous viscoelastic treatments, which are bonded to the <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>panels,</b> take charge of the vibration damping, while the sound absorption and insulation is obtained by means of the poroacoustic treatments. The solution proposed here consists of employing porous materials to perform both these functions, thus allowing the partial or complete removal of the viscoelastic damping treatments from the <b>car</b> <b>body.</b> This should decrease the weight of the vehicle, reducing fuel consumption and emissions, and it might also benefit production costs...|$|R

Triangular patches do not have these problems. Since triangular shapes arise rather frequently in the design of complicated surfaces (e. g., interior <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>panels),</b> it seems that for such surfaces triangular patches are a promising addition to the usually employed rectangular patches.

50|$|Electrostatic {{painting}} was first patented in the U.S. by Harold Ransburg {{in the late}} 1940s. Harold Ransburg founded Ransburg Electrostatic Equipment and discovered that electrostatic spray {{painting was}} an immediate success as manufacturers quickly perceived the substantial materials savings that could be achieved. In electrostatic spray painting or powder coating, the atomized particles are made to be electrically charged, thereby repelling each other and spreading themselves evenly as they exit the spray nozzle. The object being painted is charged oppositely or grounded. The paint is then attracted to the object giving a more even coat than wet spray painting, and also greatly increasing the percentage of paint that sticks to the object. This method also means that paint covers hard to reach areas. The whole may then be baked to properly attach the paint: the powder turns into a type of plastic. <b>Car</b> <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> and bike frames are two examples where electrostatic spray painting is often used.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{the number}} of low-volume cars, such as fun cars increased. The batch size for these cars is {{in the range of}} 5, 000 up to 100, 000. Common deep drawing tools for the mass {{production}} of <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> are made of steel or cast iron. They can be used for more than 1 million parts but their manufacturing is time-consuming and costly. The reason for this project was the lack of low-cost and less time-consuming manufacturing concepts for small batch production deep drawing tools. The method of resolution was based on one category of rapid tooling technology which involves the application of advanced polymers to fabricate metal forming dies. Despite their advantages in production and cost reductions, polymer dies for sheet metal forming application have several drawbacks. Due to their lack of strength compared to steel or cast iron, the use of polymer dies was limited to a production rate below 1, 000 parts. The intention of this project was a significant durability improvement of polyurethane made deep drawing tools. PVD coating and thermal coating (flame spraying and plasma spraying) have been investigated as well as the modification of polyurethane by tribological favourable additives. In fact of extensive efforts on the area of PVD coating and thermal coating was the result dissatisfying. The adhesive strength of the coatings was basically and essentially unsound, therefore the activities with this coatings have been quit. In terms of durability improvement the modified polyurethane performed very well. On this base tooling concepts have been developed and tested. These toolings are capable for a small batch size production of <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>panels.</b> Dependent on the sheet thickness, work piece material and geometry the tool life will be in a range from 3, 000 to 20, 000 parts. Compared to the common dies, made of steel or cast iron, the polyurethane dies have considerable advantages in manufacturing time and price as well as in repairing and modifying. The tool cost reduction is the outcome of less time for manufacturing and a significant smaller effort for the smooth finishing operation. (orig.)

40|$|Deflectometry is a full-field {{gradient}} {{technique that}} lends itself {{very well to}} testing specular surfaces. It uses the geometry of specular reflection to determine the gradient of the surface under inspection. In consequence, a necessary precondition to apply deflectometry {{is the presence of}} at least partially specular reflection. Surfaces with larger roughness have increasingly diffuse reflection characteristics, making them inaccessible to usual deflectometry. However, many industrially relevant surfaces exist that change their reflection characteristic during production and processing. An example is metal sheets that are used as <b>car</b> <b>body</b> parts. Whereas the molded but otherwise raw metal sheets show a mostly diffuse reflection without sufficient specular reflection, the final <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> have a high specular reflectance due to the lacquering. In consequence, it would be advantageous to apply the same inspection approach both for the raw material and for the final product. To solve this challenge, specular reflection from rough surfaces can be achieved using light with a larger wavelength, as the specular reflectivity of a surface depends on the ratio of the surface roughness and the wavelength of the light applied. Wavelengths in the thermal infrared range create enough specular reflection to apply deflectometry on many visually rough metal surfaces. This contribution presents the principles of thermal deflectometry, its special challenges, and illustrates its use with examples from the inspection of industrially produced surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Steel sheet is the {{prevalent}} material for <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>panels.</b> In the manufacturing of steel sheets a certain surface roughness is achieved {{from the ground}} or textured rolls used in the three final reduction steps. When manufacturing <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> the sheets first are formed and then painted. For these two processes, the roughness obtained from the reduction rolls will influence both friction and paint results. Furthermore, the processes have environmental effects through the choice of lubricant, amount of lubricant, paint, and amount of paint. From knowledge of pollution and cost, {{it is easy to}} understand that it is of great interest to decrease the amounts of both lubricant and paint. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} how the surface topography influences frictional behaviour and paint results. The work presented in this thesis is focused on finding and describing features in the sheet surface topography that influence friction. In order to investigate frictional behaviour and the change in surface roughness of different sheet topographies during forming, a test method that simulates the die radius in the forming tool was used. The method is called Bending-Under-Tension, BUT. In the test, steel strips were bent and drawn over a cylindrical tool, under prescribed pressure, sliding velocity, and lubrication. Thereafter, the surface topography was measured in the contacthe tool was in contact when the test was stopped. By ball-filtering the surface roughness measurements, thereby simulating realistic contact conditions, and then estimating the area fraction of contact, a so-called WihlborgCrafoord index (WC index) can be calculated. This WC index indicates whether the surface has a good lubricant supply or not. It is well correlated to the friction coefficient achieved from BUT friction tests in mixed lubrication. The WC index is designed with respect to both the Micro Plasto HydroDynamic Lubrication (MPHDL) and Micro Plasto HydroStatic Lubrication (MPHSL) mechanisms. From this WC index and previous work on prediction of paint appearance, it can be stated that in regard to the surface topography, there is no conflict between the requirements for good paint results and low friction. The paint results depend on amplitudes of waviness between 0. 83 mm, while the frictional behaviour is dependent on features in an interval of much shorter wavelengths. For low friction, the surface should have many contact areas with many small pockets on them, and the ratio of the perimeter to the area of the pockets should be maximised. The peaks of these contact areas should be located at the same height, and the angle to the edge of a lubricant pocket should be small...|$|R

40|$|Tribological {{behaviour}} (friction and wear) {{during the}} forming of sheet metals is {{strongly influenced by}} the presence of very small scale (nano-metric) surface structures, or textures, on the sheet or tool surface. Although of very small size, surface textures are able to carry pockets of lubricant into the heavily loaded tool-workpiece contact, leading to reductions in friction and tool wear. Such surface textures are also found to be critical in determining the surface finish after painting for products such as <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>panels</b> which are produced by forming operations. Indirect Structuring, or Self-Forming [1] produces a tool surface structure in a two stage process, and this structure is maintained during further wear of the surface. The process depends on implanting the tool surface with an array of metal carbide implants, giving repeating local gradients of material properties across the surface. This paper describes an experimental and accompanying theoretical model for prediction of the height difference between such implants and the surrounding substrate following wear. To reveal the key mechanisms which determine the surface texture the problem has been reduced to the study of a single thermal implant idealised as a cylinder of implant material surrounded by a concentric cylinder of the substrate...|$|R

A series of CFRP laminates were prepared by the RTM technique varying the fibre volume content (30 to 60 %), reinforcement material (woven fabrics vs. unidirectional fibre reinforcements), curing temperatures (40 °C to 120 °C), additives (SiO 2 nanoparticles as matrix fillers) and using a surface finish applied as an in-mould coating. Laminate surfaces were characterized by roughness analysis (white-light interferometry) and wave-scan measurement to quantify {{the influence of the}} different manufacturing parameters on the surface quality. Especially the used resins were intensively characterized concerning thermal properties (CTE) and total resin shrinkage. These results correlate very well with the performed analysis of surface roughness. It is found that the fibre print through effect is significantly reduced by realising low total resin shrinkage and an even distribution of resin and fibres at the surface. Thus, using of unidirectional fibre reinforcement (no weft or sewing threads; very fine filaments), low curing temperatures (slow curing processes) and an in-mould coating are most successful for reduction of fibre print through effect and getting surface similar to Class A properties. In addition, the surface quality is quite positively affected by the application of nanoparticles and also strongly controlled by roughness of tooling...|$|R
