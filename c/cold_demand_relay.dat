The energy demand and the electrical price in a competitive electricity market are uncertain with stochastic values which are usually performed by a probability distribution function. Therefore, a stochastic mathematical model representing an optimal operation of energy hub {{is based on the}} objective function of minimization of energy costs (including electricity and gas). Several constraints such as energy balance, limited capacity of the transformer, air conditioners, gas boilers, absorption chillers, combined heat, and power and battery energy storage system are also incorporated into the model to guarantee the required specifications. The high-level algebraic modeling software, general algebraic modeling system has been employed to undertake calculations. Finally, numerical results have illustrated the efficiency and capability of the proposed models.|$|R

We {{test for the}} first time the interactive impacts of <b>cold</b> <b>demands,</b> heat demands, precipitation, and income on the autocracy of central government. Eight regression analyses across 173 nations, with R 2 ranging from 0. 29 to 0. 55, show that political cultures vary from maximally autocratic in poor countries threatened by demandingly cold and dry climates, to maximally democratic in rich countries challenged by demandingly cold and dry climates. Moreover, demandingly hot and dry climates appear to promote autocracy everywhere, irrespective of the country’s level of income. The best documented rival explanations, including human-to-human transmitted diseases, ethnic diversity, and low average intelligence of the population, could not account for the findings.

President Takarada focuses on the way she has begun to suppress the emotion of 'the desire to be loved' as her main problem, though as that feeling was the lynchpin of a severely unhealthy coping mechanism, suppressing it was probably a necessary phase in her development, especially as 'the desire to have friends who care about her' was not severely harmed.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} methods proposed for reduction of consumed energy in facility and ventilation systems in a building is application of ground source heat pumps (GSHPs). With regard to the enhanced use of such pumps in providing heat and <b>cold</b> <b>demands</b> in homes, commercial centers, institutions and industrial buildings analysis of their performance as well as their benefits and deficiencies compared to common ventilation systems have gained interest of many researchers.

They have no combustion and they only transfer heat. In the present article first, performance conditions of ground source heat pumps (in two modes of heating and cooling) are analyzed. Then in order to assess the performance of proposed model economically, its application in Iran will be studied.

These environmental data were than correlated with Landolt indicator values for temperature preferences of different vegetation units.

40|$|The {{synchronous}} {{occurrence of}} solar irradiation and <b>cold</b> <b>demand</b> and its causality {{led to the}} development of solar cooling facilities. Previously, a number of prototypes and demonstration plants have been erected world wide. Several techniques and concepts are discussed currently and there is still a high necessity for research and development. But there are also first operational experiences gathered by the existing plants. For the further development of solar cooling and the implementation of these systems into the market, it is important to evaluate and to interpret the available experiences. Since 2002 Fraunhofer UMSICHT has operated a solar cooling plant on its premises in Oberhausen, Germany. The plant target cold capacity is 58 kWth for space cooling. Most of the motive heat energy is provided by a solar tube collectors field while the backup heat source is the heating system of the institute. The plant also provides solar surplus heat to the institute heating system in spring and in autumn. Furthermore, the plant concept allows the operating mode "free cooling", which means that the cold capacity is exclusively provided by the recooling unit when the ambient air temperature is low enough. The proposed paper describes the solar cooling plant and its integration in an existing energy supply network. In addition, it summarises and analyses the operating experiences of the years 2002 to 2007. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{worldwide}} increasing {{heat and}} <b>cold</b> <b>demand</b> leads to rising energy consumption and emission of CO 2. In contrast, {{a decrease of}} CO 2 emissions is necessary to limit climate change. Thermally driven adsorption heat pumps and chillers can reduce CO 2 emissions by use of waste heat or solar radiation. Thus, adsorption heat pumps can provide heat and cold almost emission free at high primary energy efficiencies. A drawback of the adsorption technology is the size and cost of the devices. Compared to mechanical compression heat pumps and chillers adsorption devices are significantly larger. Furthermore, the heat exchangers of adsorption chillers are bigger and low number of units leads to higher costs. Current research activities focus on the efficiency and the specific heating and cooling capacity of adsorption units to make them economically competitive. System design, new adsorbent materials and heat exchanger design are the main research topics. Much less attention is given to evaporator and condenser design although these components are equally essential for operation of the adsorption device. For targeted development dynamic computer models are usually employed. In general, the models are neither experimentally calibrated nor validated at different operating points of real adsorption systems. Thus, high uncertainty in model-based development of adsorption units remains. The present dissertation refines model-based development of adsorption heat pumps and chillers on two levels: On the system level a dynamic model of an adsorption unit is developed, experimentally calibrated and validated at different operating points of a real adsorption system. The model provides qualified prediction of system behavior since accurate and coherent models are used. Furthermore, the model allows for reliable evaluation of new adsorbent materials as it is validated against the change of material parameters. This renders the possibility of integral optimization of process and material. On the component level the development potential of adsorption units is exemplary demonstrated for the evaporator. The evaporator usually possesses low heat transfers characteristics and limits {{the capacity of the}} whole adsorption unit. Heat exchangers employing capillary action lead to significantly higher evaporation performances. In this work porous coatings are investigated to promote capillary-assisted evaporation. The coating is applicable to many heat exchanger designs and may lead to powerful and cost-efficient evaporators in future. In addition, this work studies the general influence of the evaporator on the performance of adsorption units. The developed system model is used to quantify the evaporator influence and to determine the optimal test conditions for experimental evaluations. The results allow sound design of the evaporator and identification of optimal process conditions to exploit the full potential of the adsorption unit. Thus, validated simulation models allow targeted optimization of adsorption heat pumps and chillers. This work provides a tool to increase the efficiency and capacity of adsorption units that is essential for the consumer acceptance and distribution. In future, the adsorption technology may therefore contribute to a larger extent to cover the worldwide heat and <b>cold</b> <b>demand</b> with the economically friendly use of waste heat and solar energy...|$|R

The intention {{of this study is to}} fulfill the ambitions of the Energi 21 strategy. The study is based on the building project in the Risvollan district of Trondheim, Norway. The building project includes a kindergarten, apartment building, assisted accommodation, care home and the existing Risvollan Center with shopping and healthcare floor. An energy analysis based on the software program SIMIEN provides information about the expected heat and <b>cold</b> <b>demand</b> of the Risvollan buildings. Based on this energy analysis and the applicable technologies for covering the thermal energy demand of the buildings, three energy concepts are designed.

The energy efficiency ratios are decisive for the calculations of the expected annual costs. The Levelized Energy Costs (LEC) are made in order to compare the energy concepts from an economically point of view. The conclusion of this study shows that all three energy concepts are able to meet the target of covering the Risvollan project buildings with sufficient thermal energy.
