5|$|According to filmmaker Matthew Clayfield, Kiarostami's {{work with}} digital video {{may be more}} {{valuable}} to cinema {{than it is to}} post-cinema, but it also proves that virtually anyone with a camera can <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> art form in ways that were previously impossible.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> self-stability of {{traditional}} bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism {{is in front of}} the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass also <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E

5|$|Ground {{temperature}} measurements, {{like most}} weather observations, are logged by location.

Doing so, the presence of heat islands is visible, but overall trends change in magnitude, not direction.|$|E

5|$|Mogadishu is a {{multi-ethnic}} city. Its original core population {{consisted of}} Bushmen aboriginals, and later Cushitic, Arab and Persian migrants.

In the colonial period, European expatriates, primarily Italians, would also <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city's cosmopolitan populace.|$|E
