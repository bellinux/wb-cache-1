40|$|Introduction: Dark {{chocolate}} contains {{at least}} 60 % - 70 % of coca is plant-derived, has flavonoids {{that act as}} anti-inflammatory and antioxidants and protect the body from free radicals. Epicatechin is a particularly active member {{of a group of}} compounds called plant flavonoids. The elevated blood levels of epicatechin triggers the release of active substances that keeps away cholesterol from gathering in blood vessels, reduce the risk of blood clots, relax blood vessels and lower blood pressure which may reduce the risk of certain illnesses such as heart attacks, hypertension and atherosclerosis. Method: A comprehensive literature search was conducted through electronic medium to explore the relevant literature. Various databases i. e. Pub med, Google search engines, Science Direct, JPMA and SAGA were used. Manual search was also done by accessing articles from 2000 till 2012 in AKU periodic library. Result: It has been reported that eating a small, 1. 6 -ounce bar of dark chocolate every day induces coronary vasodilation, improves coronary vascular function and decreases platelet adhesion 2 hours after consumption. Evidence to date suggests that the chocolates should be dark, flavonoid rich and of at least 60 - 70 % cocoa, or formulated to be enriched with polyphenols. Conclusion: The blood pressure and cholesterol lowering effects of dark chocolate consumption are beneficial in the prevention of cardiovascular events with metabolic syndrome. But on the other hand chocolate can carry substantial amounts of calories, fat and sugar, a little dark <b>chocolate</b> is <b>good,</b> a lot is not better, so moderation is the key.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to compare several physical, {{chemical}} and organoleptic properties of three types of dark chocolate with different contents of vegetable fat to identify if partial or total replacement of cocoa butter influences chosen parameters. Aroma compounds were determined by the solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography, fatty acids as methyl esters using gas chromatography, flavour and colour were evaluated sensorially, and texture by both instrumental and sensory analyses. Partial replacement of cocoa butter (up to 5 % allowed by the European legislation) had only negligible effect on the monitored properties, differences between the samples were statistically insignificant (P < 0. 05). However, total replacement of cocoa butter (as in various chocolate imitations) significantly (P < 0. 05) influenced the properties.

50|$|In cocoa butter, {{there are}} six {{essential}} polymorphic forms. The polymorphic transformation theory {{is based on the}} fact that bloomed chocolates are always found to contain the most stable VI polymorph of cocoa butter. According to this theory, bloom occurs through the uncontrolled polymorphic transformation of cocoa butter from a less stable form (form IV or V) to the most stable form (form VI). The technology of <b>good</b> <b>chocolate</b> production depends on ensuring that only the stable form of the cocoa butter ingredient exists in the final product. In poorly tempered chocolate, form IV will transform to V and eventually form VI, resulting in bloom, while in well-tempered chocolate, form V will transform to form VI and bloom may also occur. Elevated and/or fluctuating temperatures promote the transformation rate and thus also promote the rate of bloom formation. However, it is found that the production of form VI from form V does not always lead to bloom; a direct relationship cannot be established between fat bloom and the evolution of the crystalline forms. The onset of transformation from form V to form VI crystals is not the cause of visual bloom; rather, this transition should be considered as an aspect of cocoa butter recrystallization that may result in bloom.|$|R

Physical parameters, microbial community dynamics, yeast and bacterial species diversity [mainly {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB) and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) ], and metabolite kinetics were monitored, and chocolates were produced from the respective fermented dry cocoa beans. Similar microbial growth and metabolite profiles were obtained for the two fermentations. Low concentrations of citric acid {{were found in the}} fresh pulp, revealing low acidity of the raw material. The main end-products of the catabolism of the pulp substrates glucose, fructose, and citric acid by yeasts, LAB, and AAB were ethanol, lactic acid, acetic acid, and/or mannitol. Hanseniaspora opuntiae, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Acetobacter pasteurianus were the prevalent species of the two fermentations. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pentosus, and Acetobacter ghanensis were also found during the mid-phase of the fermentation processes. Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides and Acetobacter senegalensis were among the prevailing species during the initial phase of the fermentations.
