The two types of fuzzy <b>controllers</b> treat IF-THEN rules differently. In Mamdani fuzzy <b>controllers,</b> rules are treated disjunctively. In fuzzy logic <b>controllers,</b> rules are treated conjunctively. Finally, we provide a unified proof of the property of universal approximation for both types of fuzzy <b>controllers...</b>|$|R

Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per <b>controller).</b> Having the <b>controller</b> installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the <b>controller,</b> each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E
