While these calls reflect the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of biology research, crossing disciplinary boundaries in the classroom carries epistemological challenges for both instructors and students. In this paper we expand on the construct of authenticity to better describe and understand disciplinary practices, in particular, to examine those used in undergraduate physics and biology <b>courses.</b> <b>We</b> then apply these ideas to examine an introductory biology course that incorporates physics and mathematics. We characterize how instructors asked students to use interdisciplinary tools in this biology course and contrast them with the typical uses of these tools in physics <b>courses.</b> Finally, <b>we</b> examine student responses {{to the use of}} mathematics and physics in this course, to better understand the challenges and consequences of using interdisciplinary tools in introductory <b>courses.</b> <b>We</b> link these results to the reform initiatives of introductory physics courses for life-science students...|$|R

40|$|Students begin {{each new}} course {{with a set}} of {{expectations}}. These expectations are formed from their experiences in their major, class level, culture, skills, etc. However, faculty and the students are often not on the same page with respect to expectations even though faculty provide students with course syllabi. It is crucial for faculty to understand students 2 ̆ 7 expectations to maximize students 2 ̆ 7 learning, satisfaction, and success. Furthermore, it would promote classroom transparency. There would be no hidden unstated expectations; disappointments during the course can potentially be minimized. We present the results of a survey focused on understanding student expectations. Specifically, we focus on examining the differences in expectations of the students of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) courses and non-computing STEM <b>courses.</b> <b>We</b> present our analysis and observations of the results using aggregate data for all students at all class levels. We observe various differences and similarities among the STEM fields. Identifying differences is crucial since many non-computing STEM majors are enrolled in computing courses, especially in the lower level <b>courses.</b> <b>We</b> provide a detailed comparison among sophomore and senior level courses in computing, biology and chemistry <b>courses.</b> <b>We</b> also compare sophomore and senior CSE <b>courses.</b> Finally, <b>we</b> discuss the importance of paying attention to all students 2 ̆ 7 needs and expectations. Armed with this knowledge, faculty members can increase transparency in the classroom, student satisfaction, and possibly student retention...|$|R
