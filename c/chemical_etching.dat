5|$|ZnO has wide direct {{band gap}} (3.37 eV or 375nm at room temperature). Therefore, its most common {{potential}} applications are in laser diodes and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Some optoelectronic applications of ZnO overlap with that of GaN, which has a similar bandgap (~3.4 eV at room temperature). Compared to GaN, ZnO has a larger exciton binding energy (~60 meV, 2.4 times of the room-temperature thermal energy), which results in bright room-temperature emission from ZnO. ZnO can be combined with GaN for LED-applications. For instance as transparent conducting oxide layer and ZnO nanostructures provide better light outcoupling. Other properties of ZnO favorable for electronic applications include its stability to high-energy radiation and its possibility to be patterned by wet <b>chemical</b> <b>etching.</b> Radiation resistance makes ZnO a suitable candidate for space applications. ZnO is the most promising candidate {{in the field of}} random lasers to produce an electronically pumped UV laser source.|$|E

25|$|Already in his patent {{application}} of 1886 Pollak {{wrote that the}} capacitance of the capacitor increased if {{the surface of the}} anode foil was roughened. A number of methods have since been developed for roughening the anode surface, mechanical methods like sand blasting or scratching, and <b>chemical</b> <b>etching</b> with acids and acid salts forced by high currents. Some of these methods were developed in the CD factory between 1931 and 1938. Today (2014), electro-chemically etching of low voltage foils can achieve up to a 200 fold increase in surface area compared to a smooth surface. Progress relating to the etching process is the reason for the ongoing reduction in the dimensions of aluminum electrolytic capacitors over the past decades.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Surface {{texturing}} {{of silicon}} {{can reduce the}} reflectance of incident light and hence increase the conversion efficiency of solar cells. Many approaches have been present in texturing silicon solar cell. As a practical method, <b>chemical</b> wet <b>etching</b> has been widely used in monocrystalline silicon and multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si), but the cost and high reflectance hamper its widely used. In this paper, a new approach is present by using ionized bubble to texture multicrystalline solar cell.

25|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>etching</b> {{involves}} {{soaking the}} material surface in an etchant such as hydrofluoric acid (HF) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) until {{the surface is}} etched away to a desired roughness as created by pits and protrusions on the nanometer scale. Longer etch times lead to rougher surfaces (i.e., smaller surface pits and protrusions). Structures with specific geometry or organization cannot be created by this rudimentary method because at best it {{can be considered a}} surface treatment for changing the surface roughness. The significant advantages of this method are ease of use and low cost for creating a surface with nanotopographies.
