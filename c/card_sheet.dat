5000|$|The weekly {{magazine}} was {{also known for}} its annual free gift of [...] "Shoot League Ladders". This consisted of a thin <b>card</b> <b>sheet</b> on which were printed blank league tables for each division of the Football League and Scottish League in the appropriate team colours) which could be fitted into the slits to indicate where each team currently stood in the league table. As the season progressed and teams moved {{up and down the}} table, their tabs could be moved to new slits accordingly. Old league ladders are still regularly sold on eBay.|$|E
5000|$|Most postal {{stationery}} pieces are collected as entires, that is, the whole <b>card,</b> <b>sheet</b> or envelope. In the 19th century {{the practice was}} to collect [...] "cut squares" [...] (or cut-outs in the UK) which involved clipping the embossed indicia from a postal envelope. This destroyed the envelope. As a result, one cannot tell from a cut square what specific envelope it came from and, many times, the cancellation information. The {{manner in which the}} stamped envelope is cut out (defined by the term [...] "knife") vanishes on a cut square. Thus most collectors prefer entires to cut squares.|$|E

5000|$|Photographer Paul Wakefield did {{his first}} album work by photographing {{the cover of}} Crime of the Century. A&M Records art {{director}} Fabio Nicoli invited Wakefield to the studio where Supertramp were recording and had him read the lyrics. With the album title already chosen, Wakefield started asking himself [...] "what an appropriate sentence could be for 'the crime of the century'" [...] and combined it with a line of [...] "Asylum", “when they haunt me and taunt me in my cage”. One of his ideas, a prison cell window floating in space with a person silently screaming through the bars, {{was approved by the}} band, and when Wakefield started working a bit more on it, he reduced the prisoner to just his hands clutching the bars, [...] "a resignation to fate that the other didn’t have. It felt like there would be no reprieve." [...] A friend made the set of polished aluminum bars and welded it to a stand, and underneath it Wakefield's twin brother grabbed the bars, with his hands whitened with stage make-up. Through multiple exposure, Wakefield shot 12 pictures on transparency film, which he then combined with a backlit starscape, that was actually a black <b>card</b> <b>sheet</b> filled with holes in a darkened studio. Half of the resulting pictures had the expected result. The back cover photograph, featuring Supertramp in their underwear holding dress suits and top-hats, was originally made when the LP {{was meant to be a}} gatefold.|$|E
5000|$|A {{limited edition}} VHS set with all 22 episodes was {{released}} {{at the end}} of 2001, after the show had been cancelled, a cult following had grown. A small survey had been done with fans of the show by the show's producers, Fireworks Entertainment, where fans had voted for a VHS release at the then official Queen of Swords website (Fireworks noted they would not be making DVD collections of the series during the survey). The set was manufactured in Canada by Fireworks themselves and was sold by CanWest Global. It was made available only through online ordering to customers in the United States and Canada (NTSC region 1 format) through the official Queen of Swords website linked through Fireworks' official website at the time. It was an 8 volume VHS set (limited to under 1,000 sets made). The first tape contained episode 1 while the remaining 7 tapes contained 3 episodes each. The set cost $99.99 US/$149.99 Canada, plus shipping costs. A certificate of authenticity <b>card</b> <b>sheet</b> was also released with the set, inside the box of the first tape volume. The VHS set sold out within months. A promised special addition to the first episode's tape was not included with initial earlier pressed tapes delivered to customers, a ninth tape (which was a re-issue of the first episode volume, this time with the bonus content added at the end; the bonus material included was a lengthy set of clips and promo scenes from the series with the theme song [...] "Behind the Mask" [...] being played) was later sent to all who purchased the sets from CanWest. Subsequent orders that were made afterward were with the corrected volume 1 video.|$|E

Between 1904 and 1916, at least 54 publishing houses created Leap Year postcards illustrated by more than 17 {{of the most talented}} artists of the day.

5000|$|Starter decks in {{this set}} {{included}} an additional rare, {{bringing the total}} to three. However, the starter decks contained fewer uncommons, going down to nine from the previous thirteen. Booster Packs included one rare, three uncommons, and eleven commons. Fourth Edition was the first set to offload its land printings to a dedicated land sheet. This freed up room on the other <b>card</b> <b>sheets</b> to include more spells. As a result, booster packs could now be produced without any lands, which Wizards decided to do. Fourth Edition lands were only available in starter decks. The change was mostly seen as a positive, since by this time lands were ubiquitous and players were unhappy to find a land {{in place of a}} [...] "real" [...] card.|$|R

5000|$|This set {{featured}} 179 base cards {{plus the}} checklist. It {{also had a}} 9 card red foil chase set featuring characters from the Marvel 2099 comics. It also had one very rare hologram featuring a Spider-Man vs Venom battle (with either red, green, or the highly sought-after blue tint). This card was inserted into 1 of every 180 packs, or 1 in every 5 boxes. This set was noteworthy because 135 of the 180 base set cards were portions of larger 9 card pictures. Thus, when the cards were put into standard 9 <b>card</b> <b>sheets,</b> the <b>cards</b> formed a large, contiguous, image. There were also 9 cards of [...] "Unsolved Mysteries" [...] such as Wolverine's origin or {{the identity of the}} 6th member of the Infinity Watch.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{effectiveness}} of instructional methods based on phonics instruction in reading classes to improve students participation therefore they can develop to their maximum potential. Using qualitative tools of observation, documentation and interview, this research was focusing the inquiry on investigating students’ reception to the phonics instruction model, observing their participation in the classroom activities, also investigating instructional methods which attract students to more actively contribute in learning activities. The finding shows that the reception of students to the model was good and they showed much eagerness in following the program. Further investigation revealed that students keen to participate more in the classroom activities especially in certain activities with the use of sound sheets, sound book, flash <b>card</b> <b>sheets,</b> word box sheets, songs, games and storybooks. However, there were two challenges identified during 16 weeks running the study; the lack of teachers’ skill in delivering this method efficiently also the limited collection of English story books in school. Hence, to improve the effectiveness of the use of phonics instruction in reading classroom, firstly, training for teachers would be needed to deliver the method effectively, secondly, considering the fact that school still have limited collection of English story books or any English books, the collaboration with government agencies or other promising bodies could be done to help in providing more collection of storybooks in school...|$|R
