50|$|FiveIfootway are {{continuous}} colonnade covered walkways {{running the}} length of the fronts or sides of shophouse blocks and integral to the shophouse structure. Five footways exist for a limited length of 11.17 metres on the side of Gedung Kuning facing Kandahar Street under the house’s verandah only. The areas after those are exposed to the elements. The walkways only exist in front of the house. It ended with the party walls blocking the walkway. The walls and columns are plastered and painted. The fiveIfootways are now paved with modern tiles. However, previously, it was probably paved with terracotta tiles, waxed <b>cement</b> <b>screed,</b> granite slabs or a combination of materials.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{points out}} the {{problems}} of damage that can occur during the preparation and exploitation of a <b>cement</b> <b>screed.</b> There were described the types and properties and presented test results obtained on the samples of cement composites prepared {{with the addition of}} fibre reinforcement and shrinkage-reducing admixture. Testing procedure included the following properties: density, compressive strength, ultrasound, coefficient of construction advantages and shrinking, and above all the impact of compaction procedure on the quality of <b>cement</b> <b>screed.</b> The testing results of experimental research show that the use of polypropylene fibres and shrinkage-reducing admixture contributes to the improvement of mechanical and deformation properties of cement screeds and that installation which includes some method of vibration is crucial for screed quality. The above statements are also recommendations in the execution of <b>cement</b> <b>screed</b> in practice...|$|E
40|$|Secondary raw {{materials}} are nowadays increasingly used as materials in many {{sectors of the}} construction industry. This thesis evaluates current state of industrial floor systems and their final adjustments to increase its mechanical and chemical resistance. At the same timethis thesis focuses on the possibilities of using secondary {{raw materials}} {{in the development of}} new industrial floors. The goal is to partly replace the silicate binder in the raw material mix of <b>cement</b> <b>screed</b> with a secondary raw material to achieve the same or better physical and mechanical characteristics. This part is also verified experimentally, and its conclusion is to design an optimal recipe of screed by using secondary raw materials...|$|E

The mullock road formation includes a shallow pit on the eastern side, which was probably the casing for a weighbridge. The concentrate drying shed, which has a wedge shaped plan, consists of a slab with post holes showing its original structure. Construction of the slab is by a <b>cement</b> sand <b>screed</b> over a rubble base.|$|R
50|$|From a {{geological}} perspective, Derbyshire's solid geology can {{be split}} into two very different halves. The oldest rocks occur in the northern, more upland half of the county, and are mostly of Carboniferous age, comprising limestones, gritstones, sandstones and shales. In its north-east corner {{to the east of}} Bolsover there are also Magnesian Limestone rocks of Permian age. In contrast, the southern and more lowland half of Derbyshire contains much softer rocks, mainly mudstones and sandstones of Permo-Triassic age, which create gentler, more rolling landscapes with few rock outcrops. Across both regions can be found drift deposits of Quaternary age - mainly terrace and river gravel deposits and boulder clays. Landslip features are found on unstable layers of sandstones and shales, with Mam Tor and Alport Castles being the most well-known. <b>Cemented</b> <b>screes</b> and tufa deposits occur very rarely in the limestone dales and rivers, whilst underground cave systems have been created naturally in the limestone since Pleistocene times. The recent discovery of a system near Castleton, named Titan, is now known to have the deepest shaft and biggest chamber of any cave in Britain.|$|R
50|$|Cement screed: The {{concrete}} floor may be {{topped with a}} 25 mm thick <b>cement</b> and sand <b>screed</b> trowelled to a smooth finish. The usual mix is 1:3 and a colouring agent may {{be added to the}} mix to obtain a more attractive finish. The mix should be as dry as possible and the sand should be coarsely graded and clean to avoid shrinkage and cracking which might occur with a wet mix. The floor finish is carefully cured after laying.|$|R
40|$|The drying {{behavior}} of a freshly prepared anhydrite screed and a <b>cement</b> <b>screed</b> sample was investigated using ultrawideband microwave signals in the frequency range between about 1 GHz and 10 GHz in the reflection mode in nondestructive and contact-free way. For this purpose, the method of frequency-stepped continuous wave radar was used. At first, the back wall signal of the specimen was not recognizable due to the high attenuation of microwaves by water in the still moist sample. After {{a few weeks of}} drying, a signal was detected and increased with continued dessication, until a constant level was reached. At the same time, the position of the back wall signal shifted to smaller times due to the increase of the propagation velocity of the microwaves until here again a constant value was reached...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of self-leveling <b>cement</b> <b>screed</b> with compensated shrinkage. It is a ternary binder system with the majority of portland cement, that in the beginning of setting and hardening form an expandable folder ettringite. At first there was a background research of volume changes of hydrating cement composites and methods for measuring these changes. Various sort of expansion additives were also introduced, the main emphasis was on concepts of calculated formation of ettringite, which are typical for self-leveling underlayment. Background research included the issues of formation of ettringite, influences on it’s nucleation and it’s stability. The practical development of the screed began by measuring volume changes of different pastes on a ternary composition. Selected formulations suitable for use are verified together with additives to semi-application tests. After the final configuration of the screed mixture, there was a test in real application of an representative area. Individual formulations were tested in terms of long-term stability of ettringite in dry and moist environments...|$|E
40|$|The drying {{behaviour}} {{of freshly}} prepared anhydrite screed and <b>cement</b> <b>screed</b> samples was investigated non-destructively and in contact-free way using ultra-wideband microwave signals {{in the frequency}} range between about 1 GHz and 10 GHz. The measurements have been performed using a vector network analyser and air-coupled wideband horn antennas in reflection mode. Both entry echo and back wall echo at the interfaces of the samples were analysed. The amplitudes of the entry signals decreased within few weeks as the real part of the relative permittivity decreased with drying. Finally a plateau level was reached. At {{the beginning of the}} tests the back wall signal of the specimen was not recognizable since the attenuation of the microwaves resp. the imaginary part of the permittivity in the moist sample was too high. After a few weeks of drying, a back wall signal was detected. It increased with continued desiccation and thus lowered attenuation, until here again a constant level was reached. At the same time, the temporal position of the back wall signal moved to smaller times since the propagation velocity of the microwaves increased until a constant value was reached as well...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} a combined experimental and analytical approach to investigating modal properties of beam and block (B&B) building floors. A rarely performed dynamic testing of {{a representative sample}} of four nominally identical B&B open plan suspended ground floors in a real-life building has been carried out using state-of-the-art modal testing featuring a pair of simultaneously operating electrodynamic shakers and multi-channel data acquisition. The testing demonstrated that the floors have considerable transverse stiffness able to engage sizeable parts of the floor area {{in a manner similar to}} orthotropic plates. Although nominally identical, the four floors have somewhat different modal properties. In general, although open plan, the B&B floors tested developed considerable levels of non-proportional damping. This is possibly a consequence of friction between non-monolithic floor elements (in the beam-to-block and/or block-to-block contacts). By back analysis, using experimentally measured static stiffness and modal properties, a simple mathematical model of a rectangular simply supported orthotropic plate was verified as an applicable method for the calculation of modal properties of B&B floors tested. However, somewhat surprisingly, for this method to work, it was necessary to assume approximately 2. 5 times higher bending stiffness than that of just the beams in the B&B floors, which are the only structural elements in this type of construction. Transverse stiffness was estimated to be 8 % of this enhanced main stiffness. This is probably due to composite action of the in situ cast non-structural sand and <b>cement</b> <b>screed</b> and/or engaged friction stiffness between non-monolithically connected beams and blocks...|$|E
40|$|Addis Ababa is {{undergoing}} rapid and radical changes due to {{population growth and}} urbanisation. This forces the government {{to respond to the}} cities needs, for now mainly on infrastructure and housing. Also Addis Ketema, an inner city neighbourhood known for its commerce and market, is under pressure of development. These changes have proven to be a thread for local communities and micro-economies that exist in these informal settlements, where people inventively produce goods in self built and extended dwellings. On the other hand these changes bring opportunities to improve living conditions. But current solutions for housing, mainly in the form of condominiums, have proven not to be sufficient in terms of preservation of social networks and the adaptability and appropriation of the apartments. The design proposal intervenes on a small scale according to historical plot division to provide an urban backbone. This secures the current urban pattern without disrupting it. Next to that it gives freedom for other developments to take place within the set boundaries by the design proposal. This creates a diverse and vibrant part of the city. The building blocks consist of a support structure with brick cores, in which the piping, bathrooms and kitchens are located, and a concrete skeleton providing structural safety. In this support structure public space and street connections are secured. This support on its turn provides freedom for the dwellings that are in it. Different combinations can be made, varying from a relatively big dwelling with a shop downstairs to two small studio spaces sharing the support facilities of bathroom and kitchen. This concept of providing a more permanent support giving freedom for adaptability for the dwelling infill is present in the materialisation as well; the support is made of brick and concrete while the floors and walls of the infill is mainly made of bamboo and <b>cement</b> <b>screed.</b> Architecture and DwellingArchitectureArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|E
