5|$|The {{seeds of}} apples contain {{small amounts of}} amygdalin, a sugar and cyanide {{compound}} known as a cyanogenic glycoside. Ingesting small amounts of apple seeds will cause no ill effects, but consumption of extremely large doses can cause adverse reactions. It may take several hours before the poison takes effect, as cyanogenic glycosides must be hydrolyzed before the <b>cyanide</b> <b>ion</b> is released. The United States National Library of Medicine's Hazardous Substances Data Bank records no cases of amygdalin poisoning from consuming apple seeds.|$|E

25|$|For cyanide poisoning, a {{large amount}} of {{hydroxocobalamin}} may be given intravenously and sometimes in combination with sodium thiosulfate. The mechanism of action is straightforward: the hydroxycobalamin hydroxide ligand is displaced by the toxic <b>cyanide</b> <b>ion,</b> and the resulting harmless B12 complex is excreted in urine. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration approved (in 2006) the use of hydroxocobalamin for acute treatment of cyanide poisoning.|$|E
25|$|An older cyanide {{antidote}} kit included {{administration of}} three substances: amyl nitrite pearls (administered by inhalation), sodium nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate. The {{goal of the}} antidote was to generate a large pool of ferric iron (Fe3+) to compete for cyanide with cytochrome a3 (so that cyanide will bind to the antidote rather than the enzyme). The nitrites oxidize hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which competes with cytochrome oxidase for the <b>cyanide</b> <b>ion.</b> Cyanmethemoglobin is formed and the cytochrome oxidase enzyme is restored. The major mechanism to remove the cyanide from the body is by enzymatic conversion to thiocyanate by the mitochondrial enzyme rhodanese. Thiocyanate is a relatively non-toxic molecule and is excreted by the kidneys. To accelerate this detoxification, sodium thiosulfate is administered to provide a sulfur donor for rhodanese, {{needed in order to}} produce thiocyanate.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen cyanide {{was tested}} as a {{chemical}} weapon in WWI {{but was not}} found to be very effective. United States and Italy used hydrogen cyanide against the Central Powers in 1918. France had used it in combat already in 1916, but this proved to be ineffective due to weather conditions. The gas is lighter than air and rapidly disperses up into the atmosphere; this is in contrast to denser agents such as phosgene or chlorine which tend to remain at ground level. Compared to such agents it must also be present in higher concentrations in order to be fatal. These properties combine to make its use in the field impractical. A hydrogen cyanide concentration in the range of 100–200 ppm in air will kill a human within 10 to 60 minutes. A hydrogen cyanide concentration of 2000 ppm (about 2380mg/m3) will kill a human in about 1 minute. The toxicity is caused by the <b>cyanide</b> <b>ion,</b> which halts cellular respiration by acting as a non-competitive inhibitor for an enzyme in mitochondria called cytochrome c oxidase. As such hydrogen cyanide is commonly listed among chemical warfare as a blood agent. It is listed under Schedule 3 of the Chemical Weapons Convention as a potential weapon which has large-scale industrial uses, manufacturing plants in signatory countries which produce more than 30 metric tons per year must be declared to, and can be inspected by, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.|$|E

500|$|Assessing {{the hazard}} {{associated}} with an acid or base may require a knowledge of pKa values. For example, hydrogen cyanide is a very toxic gas, because the <b>cyanide</b> <b>ion</b> inhibits the iron-containing enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. Hydrogen cyanide is a weak acid in aqueous solution with a pKa of about 9. In strongly alkaline solutions, above pH11, say, it follows that sodium cyanide is [...] "fully dissociated" [...] so the hazard due to the hydrogen cyanide gas is much reduced. An acidic solution, on the other hand, is very hazardous because all the cyanide is in its acid form. Ingestion of cyanide by mouth is potentially fatal, independently of pH, because of the reaction with cytochrome c oxidase.|$|E
50|$|The {{canonical}} umpolung reagent is the <b>cyanide</b> <b>ion.</b> The <b>cyanide</b> <b>ion</b> {{is unusual}} in that a carbon triply bonded to a nitrogen {{would be expected to}} have a (+) polarity due to the higher electronegativity of the nitrogen atom.
