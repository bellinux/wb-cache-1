We compute the error probability and study its dependence on receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), number of transmit and receive antennas and coherence length. We show that error probability decays inversely with coherence length and exponentially with {{the product of the}} number of transmit and receive antennas. Moreover, channel outage dominates error probability in the wideband regime. We also show that the critical as well as <b>cut-off</b> <b>rates</b> are much smaller than channel capacity in this regime. I...|$|E
40|$|Speech to {{personal}} assistants (e. g., reminders, calendar entries, messaging, voice search) is often uttered under cognitive load, causing nonfinal pausing {{that can result}} in premature recognition cut-offs. Prior research suggests that prepausal features can discriminate final from nonfinal pauses, {{but it does not}} reveal how speakers would behave if given longer to pause. To this end, we collected and compared two elicitation corpora differing in naturalness and task complexity. The Template Corpus (4409 nonfinal pauses) uses keyword-based prompts; the Freeform Corpus (8061 nonfinal pauses) elicits open-ended speech. While nonfinal pauses are longer and twice as frequent in the Freeform data, prepausal feature modelling is roughly equally effective in both corpora. At a response latency of 100 ms, prepausal features modelled by an SVM reduced <b>cut-off</b> <b>rates</b> from 100 % to 20 % for both corpora.

40|$|CONTEXT: Overexpression of HER- 2 /neu {{oncogene}} {{in breast}} cancer patients is correlated with disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The most commonly used methods {{for the detection of}} HER- 2 /neu status are immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). However, therse is a lot of controversy with regard to the best method. Most of the FISH studies chose arbitrary cut-off levels for positive results (10 %) and had no validation. AIM: In order to address these issues, we designed a pilot study of 38 samples with known IHC status representing all 4 categories. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: FISH was performed using Vysis Pathvysion™ probe. For validation, 5 cases of reduction mammoplasty were analyzed using same protocols. RESULTS: Our results showed significant discordance between FISH and IHC. The rate of discordance was much higher in the 0, 1 +, and 2 + categories compared to published literature. This could be due to the lower <b>cut-off</b> <b>rates</b> for positive amplification established by validation in our study (5. 7 % vs 10 %). Our analysis showed that FISH positive and IHC negative patients have a poor prognosis in terms of DFS and OS compared to FISH negative and IHC negative patients. Further, our results also showed that IHC in comparison to FISH has a comparable specificity (98 %), but has a very low sensitivity (46 %). CONCLUSION: Based on these results, we consider FISH to be the gold standard for detecting HER- 2 /neu status {{in breast cancer}}...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of the}} <b>cut-off</b> <b>rate</b> {{criterion}} for modulation system design is investigated for channels with non-white Gaussian noise. A signal space representation of the waveform channel is developed, and the <b>cut-off</b> <b>rate</b> for vector channels with additive non-white Gaussian noise and unquantized demodulation is derived.

40|$|Adult Separation Anxiety (ASA) is an under-researched {{phenomenon}} {{and is currently}} {{not included in the}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) despite {{a growing body of research}} literature showing its presentation in adults. There are a significant number of studies of adults using illicit substances and studies linking the use of substances and anxiety, yet none found so far to link substance use with Adult Separation Anxiety. The first aim of the current study was to investigate if Adult Separation Anxiety was present in a group of substance using clients in a drug treatment service. The second aim was to then explore the meaning and construction of the anxiety in those substance users presenting with this anxiety. Thirty-two substance using clients within a drug treatment service were given the Adult Separation Anxiety Self-Report Questionnaire (ASA- 27), see Appendix 11. From this, 12 were interviewed using the Adult Separation Anxiety Semi-Structured Interview (SASI-II). The questionnaire data was analysed using the <b>cut-off</b> <b>rates</b> given by the questionnaire creators as indicators for the presence of Adult Separation Anxiety Disorder. The interview data was analysed using a Grounded Theory methodology to generate a theory. From the questionnaire scores 16 of the 32 participants who completed the ASA- 27 questionnaire scored above 22, the cut-off for Adult Separation Anxiety Disorder, and 21 of the 32 participants scored above 16, the cut-off rate indicating the presence of Adult Separation Anxiety.

40|$|The present paper compares {{estimates}} of the social rate of return to education for Indigenous Australians with those for non-Indigenous Australians. The social rate of return measures the net benefits to society of educating its citizens. If education is treated as an investment by society in its people, then Australian society will be made better off {{by an increase in}} educational investment as long as the social rate of return is higher than that for other public investments. This paper provides a discussion of the concept of the social rate of return to education and some estimates for Indigenous Australians. Higher levels of education, in general, lead to an increased probability of finding employment and higher levels of income in employment. Hence, an increased level of education for an Indigenous person would be of advantage in economic terms; the private rate of return to education is likely to be quite high. In addition, we argue that increasing education has important social benefits (so-called 'externalities') for Indigenous people, and society in general: improved education would lead to better nutrition, to better living conditions, to better access to health services, and hence to a longer and healthier life. This means that productivity would be higher for Indigenous people and they would have higher incomes {{over a longer period of}} time. In addition, we argue that improved levels of education have the capacity to contribute to a decrease in the numbers of Indigenous people who are imprisoned, and thus lead to a direct reduction in the costs of imprisonment. Thus, increased education increases the earnings span, decreases prison costs and hence increases the social rate of return. We find that the social rate of return for education is generally higher for Indigenous Australians than for non-Indigenous Australians. This suggests, from a public policy perspective, that government should allocate increased funding for the education of Indigenous people since this social rate of return is greater than the Department of Finance recommended <b>cut-off</b> <b>rates</b> for government investment projects. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) wideband Rayleigh block fading channel where the channel state is unknown at the {{transmitter and receiver}} and there is only an average input power constraint. We compute the capacity and analyze its dependence on coherence length, number of antennas and receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per degree of freedom. We establish conditions on the coherence length and number of antennas for the non-coherent channel to have a "near coherent" performance in the wideband regime. We also propose a signaling scheme that is near-capacity achieving in this regime. We compute the decoding error probability and study its dependence on SNR, number of antennas and coherence length. We show that error probability decays inversely with coherence length and exponentially with {{the product of the}} number of transmit and receive antennas. Moreover, in the wideband regime, channel outage dominates error probability and the critical and <b>cut-off</b> <b>rates</b> are much smaller than channel capacity. In the second part of this thesis, we introduce the concept of a fiber aided wireless network architecture (FAWNA), which allows high-speed mobile connectivity by leveraging the speed of optical networks. (cont.) Specifically, we {{consider a}} single-input, multiple-output (SIMO) FAWNA, which consists of a SIMO wireless channel interfaced with an optical fiber channel through wireless-optical interfaces. We propose a design where the received wireless signal at each interface is sampled and quantized before being sent over the fiber. The capacity of our scheme approaches the capacity of the architecture, exponentially with fiber capacity. We also show that for a given fiber capacity, there is an optimal operating wireless bandwidth and number of interfaces. We show that the optimal way to divide the fiber capacity among the interfaces is to ensure that each interface gets enough rate so that its noise is dominated by front end noise rather than by quantizer distortion. We also show that rather than dynamically change rate allocation based on channel state, a less complex, fixed rate allocation scheme can be adopted with very small loss in performance. by Siddharth Ray.

40|$|We {{consider}} the computational <b>cut-off</b> <b>rate</b> {{and its implications}} on signal design for the complex quasistatic Rayleigh at fading spatio-temporal channel under a peak power constraint where neither transmitter nor receiver know the channel matrix. The <b>cut-off</b> <b>rate</b> has an integral representation which is an increasing function of the distance between pairs of complex signal matrices. When the analysis is restricted to finite dimensional sets of signals interesting characterizations of the optimal rate-achieving signal constellation can be obtained. For arbitrary finite dimension, the rate-optimal constellation must admit an equalizer distribution, i. e., a positive set of signal probabilities which equalizes the average distance between signal matrices in the constellation. When the number N of receive antennas is large the distance-optimal constellation is nearly rate-optimal. When the number of matrices in the constellation {{is less than the}} ratio of the number of time samples to the number of transmit antennas, the rate-optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>rate</b> attaining constellation is a set of equiprobable mutually-orthogonal unitary matrices.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{classical}} problem of characterizing the channel capacity and its achieving distribution in a generic fashion. We derive a simple relation between three parameters: the input-output function, the input cost function {{and the noise}} probability density function, one which dictates the type of the optimal input. In Layman terms we prove that {{the support of the}} optimal input is bounded whenever the cost grows faster than a <b>cut-off</b> <b>rate</b> equal to the logarithm of the noise PDF evaluated at the input-output function. Furthermore, we prove a converse statement that says whenever the cost grows slower than the <b>cut-off</b> <b>rate,</b> the optimal input has necessarily an unbounded support. In addition, we show how the discreteness of the optimal input is guaranteed whenever the triplet satisfy some analyticity properties. We argue that a suitable cost function to be imposed on the channel input is one that grows similarly to the <b>cut-off</b> <b>rate.</b> Our results are valid for any cost function that is super-logarithmic. They summarize a large number of previous channel capacity results and give new ones {{for a wide range of}} communication channel models, such as Gaussian mixtures, generalized-Gaussians and heavy-tailed noise models, that we state along with numerical computations.

40|$|Abstract — The outage {{behaviour}} of {{the single}} cell DS-CDMA uplink is investigated for flat Rayleigh fading channels. Goal {{of the work is}} to find an analytical way for the optimisation of the system spectral efficiency under some outage probability constraint by adjusting parameters such as modulation, spreading factor, code rate and number of codes per user. Therefore, the results of the asymptotic analysis for large CDMA systems with random spreading codes are used to obtain the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio after the linear minimum mean-squared-error detector. This information is then deployed to characterize the system performance using bounds of the information theory. First, the ergodic behaviour is investigated with respect to the spectral efficiency for both coding at capacity and discrete modulation and coding at <b>cut-off</b> <b>rate.</b> Then, the outage probability is defined and studied for coding at capacity. The influence of the system load on the outage is determined analytically and compared to simulation results.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{research}} aims at constructing {{an optimal}} portfolio that maximizes the overall return and minimizes the {{risk associated with}} the individual stocks using the Sharpe Single Index Model. The study includes 25 stocks from five different sectors. Only the secondary data {{for the past five}} years (2007 - 08 to 2011 - 2012) are used in the study. The final portfolio thus constructed includes stocks from more than one sector. Thus even if some of the sectors do not perform well as expected, it will be compensated by the excess returns from the other sectors that exceed the expectation. This is how risk is diversified. This method of construction of optimal portfolio is very effective and convenient as revision of the optimal portfolio can be an ongoing exercise. The existence of a <b>cut-off</b> <b>rate</b> (Ci) is also extremely useful because most new stocks that have an excess return-to beta ratio above the <b>cut-off</b> <b>rate</b> (Ci) can be included in the optimal portfolio.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} linear {{transmitter}} design that aims at minimizing the packet error rate (PER) using partial channel state {{information at the}} transmitter (CSIT). The design {{is based on the}} maximization of the channel <b>cut-off</b> <b>rate,</b> which provides an upper bound on the codeword error probability over the ensemble of random codes. The advantage of this optimization criterion is that it allows to get a low PER while keeping the design independent of the specific channel code used in the system. The algorithm is derived for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, and adopts a Bayesian approach to design an algorithm robust to CSI errors. The proposed algorithm converges to the open-loop transmission scheme for the case of no channel knowl-edge and it converges to the closed-loop design with perfect CSI for the case of no uncertainty. Simulation results evidence the performance gain in terms of PER and throughput of the proposed algorithm when compared to more commonly used optimization criteria.

40|$|The common {{approach}} of designing a communication device is to maximize a well-defined objective function, e. g., the channel capacity and the <b>cut-off</b> <b>rate.</b> We propose easy-to-implement solutions for Gaussian channels that approximate the optimal results for these maximization problems. Three topics are addressed. First, {{we consider the}} case where the channel output is quantized, and we find the quantization thresholds that maximize the mutual information. The approximation derived from the asymptotic solution has a negligible loss on {{the entire range of}} SNR when 2 -PAM modulation is used, and its quantization thresholds linearly depend on the standard deviation of noise. We also derive a simple estimator of the relative capacity loss due to quantization, based on the high-rate limit. Then we consider the integer constraint on the decoding metric, and maximize the mismatched channel capacity. We study the asymptotic solution of the optimal metric assignment and show that the same approximation we derived in the matched decoding case still holds for the mismatched decoder. Finally, we consider the demodulation problem for 8 PSK bit-interleaved coded modulation(BICM). We derive the approximated optimal demodulation metrics that maximize the general <b>cut-off</b> <b>rate</b> or the mismatched capacity using max-log approximation. The error rate performances of the two metrics' assignments are compared, based on Reed-Solomon-Viterbi(RSV) code, and the mismatched capacity metric turns out to be better. The proposed approximation can be computed using an efficient firmware algorithm, and improves the system performance of commercial chips. by Qian Yu. Thesis: M.

It is shown that with a MF receiver higher order modulation in combination with coding has no advantage. In contrast, beyond a particular signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold the spectral efficiency of a CDMA system can be improved with larger constellations when deploying an LMMSE receiver. Depending on the SNR an optimum modulation scheme exists, which was shown {{for a number of}} QAM constellations...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedExpressions for a generalized Modified Transitional Butterworth-Chebyshev (MTBC) filter are derived. The characteristics of this filter {{as applied to}} digital filter design are investigated. It is shown that by adjusting location and order of the inserted zeros, the <b>cut-off</b> slope <b>rate</b> of the filter can be traded for maximum attenuation in the stop-band. The performance of this MTBC filter is {{compared to that of}} Butterworth, Chebyshev, transitional Butterworth-Chebyshev filters together with those suggested by other investigators [1]-[3]. It is shown that the stop-band attenuation can be significantly increased without great sacrifice of <b>cut-off</b> slope <b>rate.</b> Step response of this MTBC filter is also obtained and compared with other filters. Various tabulations as well as graphs of this filter are given for design purposes. A computer program is developed for the design of this filter. [URL] Turkish Nav...|$|R
