40|$|An {{overview}} {{is given}} <b>of</b> diseases in <b>mites,</b> caused by infectious microorganisms. Many pathogens {{play an important}} role in the regulation of natural populations <b>of</b> <b>mite</b> populations and are for this reason subject of research on the feasibility to develop such pathogens to biological control agents. Several examples are given of successful application of pathogens for the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>mite</b> pests, but also failures are discussed. Most studies concern fungal pathogens of tetranychids and eriophyids; some of these fungi are possible candidates for biological <b>control</b> agent <b>of</b> species <b>of</b> noxious <b>mites.</b> An interesting group of pathogens form the intracellular symbionts: bacteria that may cause unusual effects in their hosts, such as parthenogenesis, feminization, male killing and incompatibilities. This group of bacteria is present in many invertebrates species and are presently widely studied as new molecular techniques have become available that make detection of such symbionts possible. Attention is also given to quality <b>control</b> <b>of</b> beneficial <b>mites</b> that are being used in integrated control programs. Beneficial mites, as e. g. predatory mites, may also be infected by microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, microsporidia), resulting in poor performance of the predator.

40|$|Dermanyssus gallinae is a {{haematophagous}} ectoparasite {{responsible for}} anemia, weight loss, dermatitis and {{a decrease in}} egg production. Dermanyssus gallinae {{may play a role in}} the modulation of the host immune system, maybe predisposing the host to some bacterial infections such as chlamydiosis. This is an important zoonosis. Humans are exposed to Chlamydia psittaci through inhalation of the agent dispersed from the infected birds. In this study, a syndrome observed in an aviary of canaries was investigated. A heavy infestation by D. gallinae was reported. Simultaneously, a C. psittaci infection was molecularly confirmed in the canaries. Combined therapy was applied successfully. The association of C. psittaci with the examined mites has been confirmed. Therefore, we think that D. gallinae have played a role in the spreading of C. psittaci infection among the canaries. Moreover, D. gallinae could have played an important role predisposing the canaries to the development of chlamydiosis, by inducing anemia and debilitation.

40|$|Background: The flower bug Orius sauteri is an {{important}} polyphagous predator that is widely used for the biological <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>mites</b> and aphids. However, the optimal conditions for mass rearing of this insect are still unclear, thus limiting its application. Methodology: In this study, we investigated the optimal ingredients of an artificial diet for raising O. sauteri using a microencapsulation technique. The ingredients included egg yolk (vitellus), whole-pupa homogenate of the Tussah silk moth (Antheraea paphia), honey, sucrose, rapeseed (Brassica napus) pollen and sinkaline. We tested 25 combinations of the above ingredients using an orthogonal experimental design. Using statistical analysis, we confirmed the main effect factors amongst the components, and selected five optimal combinations based on different biological and physiological characters. Principal Findings: The results showed that, although different artificial diet formats significantly influenced the development and reproductive ability of O. sauteri, the complete development of O. sauteri to sexual maturity could only be achieved by optimizing the artificial diet according to specific biological characters. In general, pupae of A. paphia had more influence on O sauteri development than did artificial components.

40|$|Description of the subject. Synthetic acaricides {{have been}} widely used to manage Tetranychus urticae. Due to the {{excessive}} use of biocide and the associated problems of pesticide resistance and environmental pollution, there is an increasing demand for sustainable, environmentally-friendly control methods. Among the current alternative strategies aimed at decreasing the pest populations, the pesticides based on plant extracts are currently {{one of the most promising}} methods. Essential oils with acaricidal properties have been categorized as green pesticides because they are biodegradable and predominantly non-toxic to vertebrates. Objectives. With an aim to reduce the use of synthetic pesticides, they represent a promising approach for eco-chemical <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>mites.</b> Method. The aim of the present work was to analyze the risk of resistance emergence of T. urticae to repeated treatments with four plant extracts: Deverra scoparia Coss. & Durieu (Araliales: Apiaceae), Hertia cheirifolia (L.) Kuntze (Asterales: Ateraceae), Santolina africana Jord. & Fourr. (Asterales: Asteraceae) essential oils and garlic distillate Allium sativum L. (Asparagales: Alliaceae) after 20 generations. Results. Repeated treatments with S. africana essential oil during 20 generations did not provoke an emergence of resistance while a low development of resistance was observed with H. cheirifolia, A. sativum and D. scoparia extracts. Conclusions. The efficacy of these extracts against the two spotted spider mite and their low development of resistance make them a promising use for pest management. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pyridaben, a pyridazinone derivative, {{is a new}} {{acaricide}} and insecticide for <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>mites</b> {{and some}} insects such as white flies, aphids and thrips. Objective: This {{study was designed to}} elucidate how pyridaben can affect the sperms' morphological parameters, its DNA integrity, and to estimate the effect of various quantities of pyridaben on in vitro fertilization rate. Materials and Methods: In this study, 80 adult male Balb/C strain mice were used. Animals were divided into control and two test groups. Control group received distilled water. The test group was divided into two subgroups, viz, high dose (212 mg/kg/day) and low dose (53 mg/kg/day) and they received the pyridaben, orally for duration of 45 days. The spermatozoa were obtained from caudae epididymides on day 45 in all groups. Sperm viability, protamin compression (nuclear maturity), DNA double-strand breaks, and in vitro fertilizing (IVF) ability were examined. Results: The pyridaben treatment provoked a significant decrease in sperm population and viability in epididymides. The data obtained from this experiment revealed that, the pyridaben brings about negative impact on the sperm maturation and DNA integrity in a time-dependent manner, which consequently caused a significant (p< 0. 05) reduction in IVF capability. Embryo developing arrest was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in treated than the control group. Conclusion: Theses results confirmed that, the pyridaben is able to induce DNA damage and chromatin abnormalities in spermatozoa which were evident by low IVF rate...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMolecular markers are {{increasingly}} used for species identification and new taxa description. However, rules to determine frontiers between populations and species {{are not clear}} depending on taxa considered. For mites, few studies deal with molecular diagnoses, making rules for associated decision difficult. The present study focuses on a species of the predatory mite family Phytoseiidae (Phytoseius finitimus), considered for biological <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>mites</b> and small insect pests in fruit orchards and vineyards in the Mediterranean basin. This paper aims to elucidate the causes of great molecular variations and questions the occurrence of cryptic species. Molecular (12 S rRNA, CytB mtDNA, ITSS) and morphological analyses were performed on four populations collected in Corsica and Italy in crops (vine and kiwi) and in an uncultivated environment (Viburnum lantana). Different methods for identifying species have been used (tree approaches, distances and ABGD algorithms). A reference database of distances within and between Phytoseiidae species has been elaborated to inform the present question and to assist with further diagnosis within Acari. Mitochondrial DNA analyses show that specimens from V. lantana were well separated from the three other populations with high genetic distances, suggesting {{the existence of a}} cryptic species. Molecular ITSS analyses coupled with morphological features show however that the four populations seem to belong to the same species. The great mitochondrial polymorphism is discussed in regards to: (i) genetic distances reported for Phytoseiidae species and (ii) potential biological differences between populations (cultivated versus uncultivated areas). This study clearly emphasizes the necessity of integrative taxonomy approaches for diagnosis decisions. Furthermore, based on the polymorphism herein detected, maximal intraspecific distances are proposed (9, 23 and 2. 8 % for 12 S rRNA, CytB mtDNA and ITSS) for diagnosis decisions within Phytoseiidae. Further statistical analyses are however clearly required to determine statistical error for general and reliable decision making...|$|E

40|$|Successful {{biological}} <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>mites</b> {{is possible}} under various conditions, and identifying {{what are the}} requirements for robust control poses a challenge because interacting factors are involved. Process-based modeling can help to explore these interactions and identify under which conditions biological control is likely, and when not. Here, we present a process-based model for population interactions between the phytophagous mite, Tetranychus urticae, and its predator, Typhlodromus pyri, on apple trees. Temperature and leaf nitrogen concentration influence T. urticae rates of development and reproduction, while temperature and rate of ingestion of prey and pollen influence T. pyri rates of survival and reproduction. Predator and prey population dynamics are linked through a stage structured functional response model that accounts for spatial heterogeneity in population density throughout the trees. T. urticae biomass-days (BMD’s), which account for sizes of larvae, nymphs and adults, indicate level of mite-induced leaf damage. When BMD’s exceed 290 per leaf, there are economic losses. When BMD’s exceed 350 per leaf, T. urticae population growth is curbed and eventually the population decreases. Simulations were run to determine which conditions would lead to current year economic loss and increased risk of loss in the following year, i. e. where more T. urticae than T. pyri are present {{at the end of}} September. Risk was high with {{one or more of the}} following initial conditions: a high prey: predator ratio (10 : 1 or more); a low to intermediate (0. 04 – 0. 2 T. urticae per leaf) initial density; T. urticae with a higher initial proportion of adult females than T. pyri; and a delayed first detection of mites, whether in late July, or sometimes in late June, but not in early June. Warm summer weather, higher leaf nitrogen and T. urticae immigration into trees were also risk factors. Causes for these patterns based on biological characteristics of T. urticae and T. pyri are discussed, as are counter measures which can be taken to reduce risk...|$|E

Este trabalho foi realizado para verificar o efeito de acaricidas e inseticidas-acaricidas empregados em plantações de seringueira, e outros que teriam potencial para serem empregados contra insetos e ácaros considerados pragas dessa cultura, sobre E. concordis e N. anonymus. Utilizou-se o método {{residual}} de pulverização em superfície, recomendado como padrão pelo Grupo de Trabalho "Pesticidas e Artrópodes Benéficos", da Organização Internacional de Controle Biológico e Integrado de Plantas e Animais Nocivos/Seção Regional do Paleártico Oeste. Duas concentrações de cada um dos seguintes ingredientes ativos foram utilizadas: acefato, dicofol, endosulfan, formetanate, metomil, monocrotofós, óxido de fenbutatin e propargite. Uma das concentrações utilizadas foi uma média daquelas sugeridas pelos fabricantes para o controle de ácaros e insetos fitófagos presentes em outras culturas, uma vez que nenhum dos produtos testados tem registro para o uso em seringueira e a outra correspondeu à cerca de um terço da primeira. Endosulfan a 320 ppm, dicofol a 100 ppm e óxido de fenbutatin a 100 e 320 ppm foram inócuos a E. concordis, enquanto que endosulfan a 320 ppm e dicofol a 100 ppm foram inócuos a N. anonymus.

This work was conducted to verify the effect of acaricides and insecticides-acaricides occasionally used in rubber tree plantations, and other products {{that could be used}} against different pests (insects and mites) in this crop, on E. concordis and N. anonymus. The residual contact spray method in glass surface was used, which is recommended by the Working Group on "Pesticides and Benefic Arthropods" of the International Organization of Biologic and Integrated Control of Noxious Plants and Animals/Regional Section of the West Paleartic (IOBC/WPRS). Two concentrations of the following active ingredients were used: acephato, dicofofol, endosulfan, formetanate, metomil, monocrotophos, oxid of fenbutanin and propargit.

The herd consisted of 320 dairy cattle, 72 dams, 338 heifers in 4 herds and of 156 female young cattle, 37 feeder bulls and 10 calves. No <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>mites</b> close to the stables of animals was undertaken. A further aim of the investigation was to evaluate whether such mid-summer treatment would also result in metaphylactic effets against gastrointestinal nematodes and lungworms as well as in a reduction of the fly infestation. In June 1998, herd prevalence of chorioptes mange was established at 11 percent, following clinical symptoms. Chorioptes bovis mites were detected in 69 % of skin scrapings of clinically sick animals. After treatment with EPRINEX Pour-On clinical symptoms of mange disappeared completely within two months and did not re-occur during the subsequent stabulation period. No chorioptes mites could be detected during the entire investigation period. In December, some first-calving cows, however, showed light signs of itching and alopecia at the shoulder and the tail basis. Lice infestations with Linognathus vituli were identified in 4 animals by parasitological investigation but no mites were detected. In April 1999, shortly before animals were put on pasture (8 months after treatment with EPRINEX Pour-On), the final clinical and parasitological investigations showed that chorioptes mange was eradicated from the herd. Faecal examinations in June 1998 identified low egg numbers of gastrointestinal nematodes in 24 percent of dairy cows and 40 percent of second-season highly pregnant heifers. No lungworm larvae were detected at this date. 17 days after treatment, eggs of gastrointestinal nematodes no longer were detected and no clinical symptoms of nematode infectation were observed during the subsequent grazing season. At date of stabulation early November, low numbers of eggs of gastrointestinal nematodes were detected in 6 percent of dairy cows, in 10 and 32 percent of two first-season heifer groups and in 30 and 65 percent, respectively, two second-season heifer groups. Lungworm larvae were detected in a single animal of the second-season heifer groups and in 22 percent of the first-season heifers. In regards to fly infestation, no further use of an insecticide was necessary as fly infestation {{for the remainder of the}} pasture season was insignificant. The average milk yield on herd level increased by 1 liter per animal and day after treatment with EPRINEX Pour-On. This increase in milk yield is seen as a result of the reduction of the total parasite burden in lactating animals, being a combined effect of the eradication of chorioptes mange, reduction of fly infestation and, in particular, control of gastrointestinal nematodes...|$|E

The reduced and selective use of pesticides, accompanied by scouting services, has allowed the successful <b>control</b> <b>of</b> phytophagous <b>mites</b> by native species in several Australian tree crops, especially grapevine and citrus. In soils, Mesostigmata are extremely abundant, species-rich and play significant ecological roles. They feed on a broad range of invertebrates, including phytophagous pests that spend part or most of their lives on or in the soil or root systems. However, the majority <b>of</b> mesostigmatic <b>mite</b> species are unknown in Australia. Nevertheless, recent research indicates that many species are habitat-specific, and that they may be sensitive to agricultural practices and other land management systems. Mesostigmata have great potential for biological <b>control</b> <b>of</b> pests, and as indicators of soil quality and sustainable agricultural practices. However, the current paucity of research and information on the taxonomy, life-history and ecology of native species in natural and managed landscapes will continue to hinder their use in biological control and as bioindicators...|$|R
40|$|Conservation and augmentative {{biological}} control strategies {{have been developed}} {{to take full advantage of}} the natural enemies that occur in Spanish citrus orchards. Among them, the predatory mites Euseius stipulatus, Neoseiulus californicus and Phytoseiulus persimilis play an important role in the biological <b>control</b> <b>of</b> tetranychid <b>mites.</b> However, these predatory mites are often affected by pesticides and information about the side-effects of these products against these beneficial arthropods is essential to guarantee their efficacy. The side-effects of some pesticides remain unknown and the primary aim of this study was to fill this gap. We have further used this information and that collected from other sources to compare the response <b>of</b> these three <b>mite</b> species to pesticides. Based on this information, E. stipulatus has the most tolerant species, followed by N. californicus and P. persimilis. Therefore, using E. stipulatus as an indicator species in citrus may have led to the paradox of selecting presumed selective pesticides resulting in excessive impact on N. californicus and, especially on P. persimilis. Because these two latter species are considered key for the biological <b>control</b> <b>of</b> T. urticae in citrus, especially clementines, in Spain, we propose to use P. persimilis as the relevant indicator of such effects on predacious mites occurring in citrus instead of E. stipulatus. This change could have a dramatic impact on the satisfactory <b>control</b> <b>of</b> tetranychid <b>mites</b> in citrus in the near future...|$|R

40|$|The {{broad mite}} {{is a serious}} pest {{of a variety of}} crops worldwide. Several phytoseiid mites have been {{described}} to control these mites. However, broad mites are still one of the major pest problems on greenhouse pepper in South-eastern Spain. The generalist predatory mite A. swirskii is widely used against other pests of pepper plants such as thrips and whiteflies, the latter being a vector <b>of</b> broad <b>mites.</b> We assessed the potential of A. swirskii to control broad mites. The oviposition rate of A. swirskii on a diet <b>of</b> broad <b>mites</b> was lower than on a diet of pollen, but higher than oviposition in the absence of food. Population-dynamical experiments with A. swirskii on single sweet pepper plants in a greenhouse compartment showed successful <b>control</b> <b>of</b> broad <b>mites...</b>|$|R
