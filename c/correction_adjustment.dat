Sources of instability in money demand stem from the occurrence of a high and rapidly accelerating inflation.

40|$|Impact of {{exchange}} rate volatility has received a great attention from the last century, its importance is certain in all {{sectors of the economy}} and it affects welfare as well as social life of the economy. Exchange rate between two currencies tells the value of one currency in terms of others one. Depreciation/Appreciation {{of exchange}} rate affects economic growth in terms of trade and shifts income to/from exporting countries from/to importing countries. The factors affecting exchange rate are inflation, interest rate, foreign direct investment, government consumption expenditure and balance of trade. This research study examines the impact of oil prices and {{exchange rate volatility}} on economic growth in Germany based on 40 -year annual data. Cointegration technique is applied to check the impact of macroeconomic variables on exchange rate in the long run and short run. It is estimated that imports, exports, inflation, interest rate, government consumption expenditure and foreign direct investment had significant impacts on real effective exchange rate in the long run and short run. Sin addition, Engle Granger results indicate that relationship was significant for the long run and its error <b>correction</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism (ECM) in short a run is significant and correctly signed for Germany...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{describe}} the systematic language translation and cross-cultural evaluation process that assessed {{the relevance of}} the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey in five European countries prior to national data collection efforts. Design An approach involving a systematic translation process, expert review by experienced researchers and a review by ‘patient' experts involving the use of content validity indexing techniques with chance correction. Setting Five European countries where Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian and Polish are spoken. Participants ‘Patient' experts who had recently experienced a hospitalization in the participating country. Main OutcomeMeasure(s) Content validity indexing with chance <b>correction</b> <b>adjustment</b> providing a quantifiable measure that evaluates the conceptual, contextual, content, semantic and technical equivalence of the instrument in relationship to the patient care experience. Results All translations except two received ‘excellent' ratings and no significant differences existed between scores for languages spoken in more than one country. Patient raters across all countries expressed different concerns about some of the demographic questions and their relevance for evaluating patient satisfaction. Removing demographic questions from the evaluation produced a significant improvement in the scale-level scores (P=. 018). The cross-cultural evaluation process suggested that translations and content of the patient satisfaction survey were relevant across countries and languages.

40|$|The {{mass balance}} of Greenland has been {{assessed}} {{with data from}} the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission. Monthly data has been used through the time span of the study; January 2003 - December 2012. Level 2 data from three providers has been used. These are the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) and the Center for Space Research (CSR). The linear trend in this study points to - 181 &# 177; 11 Gt/yr, - 172 &# 177; 10 Gt/yr and - 183 &# 177; 11 Gt/yr for the three data providers respectively. Notable corrections applied to improve the accuracy {{of this study are}} gravity leakage <b>correction,</b> <b>adjustment</b> for post-glacial rebound and non-isotropic smoothing filtering. This master thesis also gives an insight some of the mathematical background of physical geodesy and how this can be applied to use GRACE data to track changes in the gravity field. The methodology of applying this theory is explained in-depth with explanations of some natural assumptions along the way. Results are presented from correction calculations, important secular trend graphs and different time series plots of data from the three data providers. These results are compared to the works of other mentionable authors in the field of polar mass redistribution. Lastly, the thesis enlists some noteworthy strengths and weaknesses of the conducted study. To the author's knowledge, this is the first ice mass loss estimation of Greenland using GRACE level 2 Release 05 data decorrelated by non-isotropic filtering. </p...|$|E

This quantitative, non-experimental, comparative survey study investigated differences in the self-reported leadership behaviors of principals who identified themselves as using either supported or unsupported professional development. Brain based learning, constructivist learning, and adult learning theories, together with professional development standards, created the conceptual framework for this study. Participants were obtained through a purposive national sampling of 7, 000 of 230, 600 U. S. principals, delimited to leaders in their school for 2 years or more. The voluntary, anonymous online survey yielded 186 usable surveys. The Principals Instructional Management Rating Scale was used to measure leadership behaviors. The t-test of means was used to compare the means of responses from supported and unsupported principals for each leadership domain. Supported principals 2 ̆ 7 means of responses were higher for Domain 1 (defining the school 2 ̆ 7 s mission).

40|$|Boeing-Canoga Park (BCP) and NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center (NASA-MSFC) are {{developing}} an Advanced Health Management System (AHMS) {{for use on}} the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) that will improve Shuttle safety by reducing the probability of catastrophic engine failures during the powered ascent phase of a Shuttle mission. This is a phased approach that consists of an upgrade to the current Space Shuttle Main Engine Controller (SSMEC) to add turbomachinery synchronous vibration protection and addition of a separate Health Management Computer (HMC) that will utilize advanced algorithms to detect and mitigate predefined engine anomalies. The purpose of the Shuttle AHMS is twofold; one {{is to increase the}} probability of successfully placing the Orbiter into the intended orbit, and the other is to increase the probability of being able to safely execute an abort of a Space Transportation System (STS) launch. Both objectives are achieved by increasing the useful work envelope of a Space Shuttle Main Engine after it has developed anomalous performance during launch and the ascent phase of the mission. This increase in work envelope will be the result of two new anomaly mitigation options, in addition to existing engine shutdown, that were previously unavailable. The added anomaly mitigation options include engine throttle-down and performance <b>correction</b> (<b>adjustment</b> of engine oxidizer to fuel ratio), as well as enhanced sensor disqualification capability. The HMC is intended to provide the computing power necessary to diagnose selected anomalous engine behaviors and for making recommendations to the engine controller for anomaly mitigation.

It was also argued that dimension reduction techniques are useful to avoid the curse-of-dimensionality, due to a potentially lower-dimensional underlying structure of summary statistics. Motivated by minimizing the quadratic loss of ABC estimators, Fearnhead and Prangle have proposed a scheme to project (possibly high-dimensional) data into estimates of the parameter posterior means; these means, now having the same dimension as the parameters, are then used as summary statistics for ABC.|$|R

Overall, 1, 334 selected athletes at U 15 years (cadet) and U 17 years (juvenile) were compared against 27, 711 licensed but unselected athletes for the same age groups. The results highlighted the influential role of the RAE on selection to national level track and field training camp opportunities.

These results support the “maturation-selection” hypothesis as a mechanism for RAE.
