30|$|Modification of {{the implant}} surface {{has been studied}} and applied to improve {{biological}} surface properties favoring osseointegration [4]. The surface roughness of implants has been increased by various methods such as machining, plasma spray <b>coating,</b> <b>grit</b> blasting, acid etching, sandblasted and acid etching (SLA), anodizing, and biomimetic coating [3 – 6]. The key factor in implant osseointegration is surface roughness, which shows increased osteoblast activity at 1 to 100  μm of the surface roughness compared to a smooth surface [6]. It is believed that rough surfaces have better osseointegration than smooth surfaces, but {{the results of the}} research have been diverse and {{it is not clear that}} multiple treatments provide better predictive results [7].|$|R

5000|$|A {{diamond plate}} is a steel plate, {{sometimes}} {{mounted on a}} plastic or resin base, <b>coated</b> with diamond <b>grit,</b> an abrasive that will grind metal. When they are mounted they are sometimes known as diamond stones. [...] The plate may {{have a series of}} holes cut in it that capture the swarf cast off as grinding takes place, and cuts costs by reducing the amount of abrasive surface area on each plate. Diamond plates can serve many purposes including sharpening steel tools, and for maintaining the flatness of man-made waterstones, which can become grooved or hollowed in use. Truing (flattening a stone whose shape has been changed as it wears away) is widely considered essential to the sharpening process but some hand sharpening techniques utilise the high points of a non-true stone. As the only part of a diamond plate to wear away is a very thin <b>coating</b> of <b>grit</b> and adhesive, and in a good diamond plate this wear is minimal due to diamond's hardness, a diamond plate retains its flatness. Rubbing the diamond plate on a whetstone to true (flatten) the whetstone is a modern alternative to more traditional truing methods.|$|R

WC- 12 %Co powders were sprayed by high {{velocity}} oxygen fuel (HVOF) to prepare coatings on carbon steel substrate, which was pretreated by electrospark and grit blast before spraying. The surface coating of WC-Co and the intermediate layer structure were studied by {{scanning electron microscopy}} and X-ray diffraction. The adhesion strength of the coating was measured by a scratching tester. Results show that the roughness value of the grit blasting and electrospark strengthened surface were 60 ~ 70 µm and 40 ~ 50 µm, respectively. The <b>coating</b> pretreated by <b>grit</b> blast and electrospark was dense and was bonded well with the substrate. The heat affected zone of the grit blasted specimen was larger than that of the electrospark pretreated one. The average adhesion strength of the <b>coating</b> pretreated with <b>grit</b> blasting and that with eletrospark were 35. 00 N and 12. 48 N, respectively.

Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersive Spectrometers were employed to analyze the bonding of diamonds to an iron-based matrix at two situations where un-coated and Ti-Cr coated diamonds were used respectively.

40|$|Abstract. To {{improve the}} bond between diamond and metal matrix in cutting or {{grinding}} tools, one effective way is to <b>coat</b> diamond <b>grits</b> with carbide forming element, titanium. In this paper, a new assessing method for the properties of Ti-coated diamonds is established by measuring the resistance. The relationships between the resistance and diamond grade, coating temperature, oxidizing temperature are discussed respectively. The {{results show that the}} resistance of Ti-coated diamond grits is mainly determined by the coating thickness and crystal shape. The resistance reduces with the increasing of the coating thickness. The more irregular the crystal, that is, the lower the grade, the smaller the resistance. For Ti-coated diamond in the order of SMD, MBD and RVD, the corresponding resistance values are 21. 2 W, 15. 8 W, 12. 3 W, respectively. The increasing of coating thickness with the rising of coating temperature results in the low resistance. The start oxidizing temperature can be indicated by the sudden change of the resistance of Ti-coated diamond grits...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} performed to examine the application of displacement controlled Ultrasonic Plastic Welding (UPW) {{in the creation of}} joints between aluminium or steel and carbon fiber reinforced polyamide 6 (CFR-PA 6). This is known as a fast welding technique in which in the order of seconds a joint can be created by means of fusion bonding of thermoplastics. This study has been focused on an assessment of the power and displacement feedback obtained during welding, the electro-insulating behavior of the created joints and their single lap shear strength & fracture. Both non-hybrid and hybrid joints have been welded. For hybrid welds, both steel and aluminium were used as metallic substrate. For aluminium substrates, the effect of not applying a coating has been evaluated as well. The absence of a coating was found to result in no bond between the applied thermoplastic and pretreated metallic surface. With the applied welding settings, hybrid welds with coated metallic substrates showed to dissipate the same amount of energy as non-hybrid welds, in the order of 700 Joules on average, at a welding time in the order of 0. 5 seconds. The obtained power and displacement feedback during welding showed to be affected by both material choice and the type of adherend in contact with the sonotrode during welding. Welding resulted in an electro-insulating thermoplastic adhesive layer between both adherends for hybrid welds. Welding <b>grit</b> blasted and <b>coated</b> aluminium samples resulted in an average single lap shear strength (SLSS) of 11 MPa. This was 16. 5 MPa with a coefficient of variation of 2. 2 % for welding with a grit blasted, nitric acid etched and coated aluminium surface. This strength is up to 80 % of a tested adhesive reference. Hybrid welds with <b>coated</b> <b>grit</b> blasted steel and the used welding settings proved to result in an average SLSS of 8 MPa. For hybrid welded samples generally adhesive peel fracture on the metallic surface occurred. The findings support the application of displacement controlled ultrasonic plastic welding in the creation of hybrid joints between CFR-PA 6 and thermoplastic coated metals like aluminium or steel.

It was used with a pestle to purée or pulverise ingredients in order to prepare elaborate and carefully seasoned Roman dishes; the Roman culinary tradition made extensive use of herbs and spices. The mortarium was the Roman equivalent of the food-processor, and is a real indicator of 'romanisation'; In Britain, the first mortaria were being imported from Gaulish sources more than a generation before Britain became a Roman province in AD 43, indicating the growing influence of Roman culture in late Iron Age southern Britain, and perhaps the actual presence of immigrants from Gaul. Later, locally-made mortaria produced at specialised potteries in different areas of the province were available throughout Britain, in addition to imported products: Paul Tyers discusses mortaria from no fewer than 16 different manufacturing sources, Romano-British and Continental, that have been found in Britain. Like so many other specialised Roman ceramic products, many mortaria also bore workshop or makers' stamps on their rims, and noting their chronology and distribution can help archaeologists understand trading patterns and the Roman economy.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fe-based metal bond {{has been}} widely used in {{fabricating}} diamond tools recently since the production cost could be greatly reduced for the low price of iron. However, graphitizing elements such as Fe, Co and Ni in the matrix catalyze the transformation of diamond to graphite during high temperature sintering process, which significantly decreases the tool’s efficiency and lifetime. In this paper, Si and Ti coating were <b>coated</b> on diamond <b>grits</b> by quasi atomic layer deposition (QALD) and vacuum slow vapor deposition (VSVD) separately not only to protect diamond from erosion but also to promote the adhesion between diamond grits and the bond. Three-point bending experiment was taken to measure the bending strength of Fe-Cu-Sn-Ni based metal bond diamond blade. In comparison with uncoated diamond blade, the bending strength of coated diamond blade improves dramatically. The theoretic calculation shows that the interface bonding strength between diamond and the metal bond increases by 181. 68 MPa owing to the Si coating. The effect of Si and Ti coating on interface bonding between diamond and the bond under different sintering temperatures was also illuminated...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe present {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out in order to study the fatigue behavior of a SAE 1045 steel substrate coated with a WC– 10 Co– 4 Cr cermet, of approximately 200 μm thick, deposited by HVOF thermal spraying. Particular emphasis {{has been paid to the}} influence of the substrate roughness prior to HVOF deposition, as a mean of improving the mechanical bonding of the coating, on the fatigue life of the coated system. Fatigue tests were conducted under rotating bending conditions (R = − 1), employing samples with different surface roughness, including as-polished, fine-grinding with abrasive paper <b>grit</b> 400 and <b>coated</b> and <b>grit</b> blasted with alumina particles of two different sizes (< 1 and < 3 mm, respectively) and coated. For comparative purposes, tests were also carried out on as-grit blasted specimens employing alumina particles of 3 mm in size. Fatigue tests were carried out at maximum alternating stresses in the range of 358 – 588 MPa, depending on the condition of the material, in order that the number of cycles to fracture varied in the range of 105 to 106. Selected samples tested at different applied stresses were analyzed after fracture by SEM techniques, which allowed the determination of the crack nucleation and propagation sequence. The results indicate that the presence of the cermet coating gives rise to a delay in the initiation of fatigue cracks at deep notches and alumina particles embedded at the steel substrate after grit blasting, leading to an insignificant fatigue strength debit of the coated specimens, in comparison with the as-polished ones. Fine-grinding, on the other hand, impairs the mechanical bonding of the coating, giving rise to its delamination from the substrate at elevated maximum alternating stresses...|$|R

To establish the basis to this hypothesis, contents of 23 trays from a grouse moor were examined for Cryptosporidium oocysts.

40|$|Statement {{of problem}} Clinical and {{laboratory}} processing techniques induce {{damage to the}} surface of zirconia frameworks, which significantly lessens their strength. Purpose The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the influence of 3 surface restoration methods on the flexural strength of zirconia bars. Material and methods Bar-shaped specimens were polished and received 1 of 2 surface treatments (n= 20) : airborne-particle abrasion with 110 -μm aluminum oxide particles at a pressure of 0. 2 MPa, or grinding with a diamond point under water cooling and a load of 2 N using an air turbine. Polished specimens served as the control (n= 20). The induced surface damage was restored using one of the following restoration methods: polishing of the specimens using an aluminum oxide polishing point (2 -μm <b>grit)</b> <b>coated</b> with 0. 5 -μm diamond polishing paste, application of a thin coat of glazing porcelain according to the manufacturer's instructions, or application of a phosphate ester monomer (MDP) containing an adhesive resin. The specimens were subjected to a 4 -point flexural strength test and then examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Two-way ANOVA and the Bonferroni post hoc test were used to analyze the data (α=. 05). Results There was a significant interaction between the type of surface damage and the restoration method (P<. 001). For the ground specimens, all restoration methods resulted in a statistically significant regain in strength, with the polishing procedure being the most effective (1027 MPa). For airborne-particle-abraded specimens, application of the bonding agent was the only effective restoration method. SEM analysis of the fractured surfaces of specimens indicated that application of the bonding agent resulted in sealing of the surface damage produced by airborne-particle abrasion, while polishing was successful in removing the grinding lines produced by the diamond point. Conclusions Within the limitations of this in vitro study, restoration of surface damage improved the flexural strength of zirconia specimens...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Cementless joint {{prosthesis}} {{has been a}} major module in joint replacement since 1980 s. However, bone-implant aseptic loosening is still an important complication. This study was performed to assess the effects of implant surface fabrications and coatings on new bone growth on and in implant surface and on mechanical stability. The study also examines the effects of gap on bone healing in bone-implant interface and exogenous mechanical stimuli on bone growth and mechanical stability. And, lastly, the development of a sheep model for implant research was also undertaken. Materials & Methods: Four types of implants were tested: plasma sprayed porous surface titanium implant with electrochemically deposited 20 &# 956;m dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) and without <b>coating</b> (TiPL); and <b>grit</b> blasted titanium implants with hydroxyapatite (HA) and without coating (TiGB). Implants were inserted into cancellous and cortical bones with gaps and fits in sheep hind limbs. One group of sheep was treated by dynamic motion therapy (DMT) postoperatively. Specimens were retrieved at five timepoints. Bone-implant mechanical stability was assessed by push-out testing. Bone ongrowth, ingrowth and remodelling were investigated by histology, SEM and BSEM images. Results: Thin electrochemical deposited DCPD coating can improve bone ingrowth in porous surface but cannot improve bone-implant interface mechanical strength. Cortical bone has better ingrowth ability than cancellous bone. Plasma sprayed porous surface has higher bone ongrowth rate and mechanical stability than grit blasted surface. Failure mode in TiPL based implants (including TiPL and DCPD) is through newly formed surrounding bone, while that in TiGB based implants (including TiGB and HA) is through bone-implant interface, HA coating or coating-implant interface. HA coating improves bone-implant gap healing better than grit blasted surface. Tighter bone-implant interface leads to earlier healing and remodelling, while a bigger gap results in less bone growth on implant. The current DMT does not enhance bone-implant interface shear strength, but improves toughness and reduces stiffness. Conclusions: The thin DCPD coating can promote osteogenesis in a porous titanium substrate, but did not improve mechanical stability. Plasma sprayed porous surface also demonstrated its superior in mechanical stability, while HA surface had higher osteoconductivity...|$|R
