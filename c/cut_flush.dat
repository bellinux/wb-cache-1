Roman numerals and runes are inscribed in the timber to identify the position of each structural member. Joints, including cross-halved, checked and mortise and tenon, interlock the timber members giving the frame greater structural rigidity. Each member must be placed into position in the correct sequence during erection due to the complexity of the jointing system.

50|$|The {{best way}} to lower {{infection}} is to control the probability of infection in the trees.

If a tree has cankered branches, the infected branches need to be cut off close to the trunk without damaging the trunk. <b>Cutting</b> the branches <b>flush</b> to the trunk gets rid of the infected branches and also reduces the risk of infection since the tree can heal from this wound more easily.

40|$|The proper {{method for}} branch removal is a long-standing {{question}} in forestry. If the branch is <b>cut</b> <b>flush</b> with the stem, a larger wound results, {{but if the}} branch is cut further from the stem, the resultant clearwood production will be less. Both alternatives have implications for tree health and wood quality. A long, international history of forest pruning research generally indicates that a cut parallel {{and close to the}} stem will maximize clearwood production without excessive stem decay. Some exceptions exist for species where potential for stem decay is high. The method recommended in most guidelines for all types of pruning is an outside branch collar approach based primarily on a small number of observational studies. However, maintaining tree health and maximizing clearwood production are not mutually exclusive and a cut close to the stem can meet both objectives. Alternative approaches to branch removal may be useful for other objectives...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{risk factors}} and {{predictors}} of failure of the Hem-o-lok(TM) vascular clip (Weck Closure Systems, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) using vessels harvested from a porcine model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vessels of various diameters were harvested from a porcine model, clipped at 90 degrees or 45 degrees using the Hem-o-lok clip and then cut either flush or with a 1 -mm cuff. The vessels were then connected to a burst-pressure device and pressures required to burst the clip or to cause it to leak were measured. RESULTS: The Hem-o-lok clip leaked or burst when the vessel to which it was applied was <b>cut</b> <b>flush.</b> The clip became even more likely to fail if the angle of application of the clip was not at 90 degrees to the vessel surface. CONCLUSION: The Hem-o-lok vascular clip is safe if it is applied at 90 degrees to the vessel surface and, more importantly, if a 1 -mm cuff is left between the clip and {{the point at which}} the vessel is divided. We would therefore discourage the practice of not leaving this cuff of tissue, in an attempt to maximize vessel length during laparoscopic donor nephrectomy...|$|E

50|$|A {{variation}} of the dowel method for reinforcement {{is the use of}} a Miller dowel in place of the usual straight cylindrical dowel. The Miller dowel is a stepped dowel and is drilled with a special stepped drill bit. It is drilled from the outside face of the frame piece to be joined and therefore generally leaves an exposed dowel protruding after glue dries, and the excess dowell head is thus usually <b>flush</b> <b>cut.</b> The advantages of the special dowel are documented in various media promoting the method, but one advantage that should not be overlooked is speed of assembly. The butt joint can often be joined temporarily and sometimes more accurately with simply glue, allowing faster set up than the usual tedious alignment procedures mentioned above. After the glue dries one or more Miller dowels are then used to reinforce the joint. Dowel trimming and sanding of the surface, followed by normal finishing then proceed in the usual manner. The blind alignment problems of floating dowels are virtually eliminated by the use of the Miller dowel. Not all projects are appropriate for the stepped dowel method if an exposed dowel end is not visually acceptable, however.|$|R
40|$|The adult CNS is an {{inhibitory}} {{environment for}} axon outgrowth, severely limiting recovery from traumatic injury. This limitation is due, in part, to endogenous axon regeneration inhibitors (ARIs) that accumulate at CNS injury sites. ARIs include myelin-associated glycoprotein, Nogo, oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). Some ARIs bind to specific receptors on the axon growth cone to halt outgrowth. Reversing or blocking {{the actions of}} ARIs may promote recovery after CNS injury. We report that treatment with sialidase, an enzyme that cleaves one class of axonal receptors for myelin-associated glycoprotein, enhances spinal axon outgrowth into implanted peripheral nerve grafts in a rat model of brachial plexus avulsion, a traumatic injury in which nerve roots are torn from the spinal cord. Repair using peripheral nerve grafts is a promising restorative surgical treatment in humans, although functional improvement remains limited. To model brachial plexus avulsion in the rat, C 8 nerve roots were <b>cut</b> <b>flush</b> to the spinal cord and a peroneal nerve graft was inserted into the lateral spinal cord at the lesion site. Infusion of Clostridium perfringens sialidase to the injury site markedly {{increased the number of}} spinal axons that grew into the graft (2. 6 -fold). Chondroitinase ABC, an enzyme that cleaves a different ARI (CSPGs), also enhanced axon outgrowth in this model. In contrast, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, which cleaves oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein and Nogo receptors, was without benefit. Molecular therapies targeting sialoglycoconjugates and CSPGs may aid functional recovery after brachial plexus avulsion or other nervous system injuries and diseases...|$|E
40|$|Understanding of flow {{resistance}} of forested floodplains {{is essential for}} floodplain flow routing and floodplain reforestation projects. Although the {{flow resistance}} of grass-lined channels is well-known, flow retention due to flow-blocking by trees is poorly understood. Flow behaviour through tree-filled channels or over forested floodplain surfaces has largely been addressed using laboratory studies of artificial surfaces and vegetation. Herein we {{take advantage of a}} broad, shallow earthen experimental outdoor channel with headwater and tailwater controls. The channel was disused and left undisturbed for more than 20 years. During this time period, small deciduous trees and a soil cover of grass, herbs and leaf-litter established naturally. We measured flow resistance and fluid retention in fifteen controlled water discharge experiments for the following conditions: (a) natural cover of herbs and trees; (b) trees only and; (c) earthen channel only. In the b-experiments the herbaceous groundcover was first removed carefully and in the c-experiments the trees were first <b>cut</b> <b>flush</b> with the earthen channel floor. Rhodamine-B dye was used to tag the flow and the resultant fluorescence of water samples were systematically assayed through time at two stations {{along the length of the}} channel. Dilution-curve data were analysed within the Aggregated Dead Zone (ADZ) framework to yield bulk flow parameters including dispersion, fluid retention and flow resistance parameters after the procedure of Richardson & Carling (2006). The primary response of the bulk flow to vegetation removal was an increase in bulk velocity, with depth and wetted width decreasing imperceptibly at the resolution of measurement. An overall reduction in flow resistance and retention occurred as discharge increased in all experiments and flow retention. Retentiveness was more prominent during low flow and for all three experimental conditions tended to converge on a constant low value for high discharges. Reach mean travel times and the advective time delays decreased very slightly from experiments (a) to (b) which is not surprising given the sparse nature of the herbaceous soil cover. Thus in these two initial experiments, the trees provided the majority of the resistance in contrast to the aggregate effect of grass, herbs and litter. Removing the trees leaving an earthen channel further decreased travel times such that the ADZ residence time was more than halved moving from (a) to (c). The overall bulk flow effect of tree cover on retention is here expressed by the dispersive fraction parameter, indicating retention volume and time, which reduced from typically 0. 4 to closer to 0. 2 when vegetation was removed. The Darcy-Weisbach friction factor during low discharges was higher for experiments (a) compared with (b) but the friction factors converged on the low earthen channel value as discharge increased. In conclusion the effect of vegetation on hydraulic retention compared with an unvegetated channel is prominent during low discharges but becomes negligible during high discharges as momentum increasingly dominates the flow...|$|E

40|$|The ends of {{prestressed}} concrete beams under expansion joints are often exposed to moisture and chlorides. Left unprotected, the moisture and chlorides {{come in contact}} with the ends of the prestressing strands and/or the mild reinforcing, resulting in corrosion. Once deterioration begins, it progresses unless some process is employed to address it. Deterioration can lead to loss of bearing area and therefore a reduction in bridge capacity. Previous research has looked into the use of concrete coatings (silanes, epoxies, fiber-reinforced polymers, etc.) for protecting {{prestressed concrete}} beam ends but found that little to no laboratory research has been done related to the performance of these coatings in this specific type of application. The Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) currently specifies coating the ends of exposed prestressed concrete beams with Sikagard 62 (a high-build, protective, solvent-free, epoxy coating) at the precast plant prior to installation on the bridge. However, no physical testing of Sikagard 62 in this application has been completed. In addition, the Iowa DOT continues to see deterioration in the prestressed concrete beam ends, even those treated with Sikagard 62. The goals of this project were to evaluate the performance of the Iowa DOT-specified beam-end coating as well as other concrete coating alternatives based on the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) T 259 - 80 chloride ion penetration test and to test their performance on in-service bridges throughout the duration of the project. In addition, alternative beam-end forming details were developed and evaluated for their potential to mitigate and/or eliminate the deterioration caused by corrosion of the prestressing strands on prestressed concrete beam ends used in bridges with expansion joints. The alternative beam-end details consisted of individual strand blockouts, an individual blockout for a cluster of strands, dual blockouts for two clusters of strands, and drilling out the strands after they are <b>flush</b> <b>cut.</b> The goal of all of the forming alternatives was to offset the ends of the prestressing strands from the end face of the beam and then cover them with a grout/concrete layer, thereby limiting or eliminating their exposure to moisture and chlorides...|$|R
40|$|Activities: Pruning {{techniques}} and bactericides (copper, COCS or Cuprofix Ultra at 4 lb/ 100 gal, phosphorous acid, Agri-Fos at 2. 5 qt/ 100 gal, applied in March and April, or no treatment) were evaluated in bacterial canker field experiments in replicate sweet cherry orchard blocks at the NYSAES, Geneva, NY and the Hudson Valley Lab, Highland, NY (2009 only; no bactericides). In 2008, trees were pruned and inoculated in April. In 2009 and 2010, another experiment {{was conducted with}} pruning and inoculation in March, April, May and post-harvest. Pruned branches averaged 3. 5 cm diameter and cuts left a stub, average 20 -cm-long. In 2008, <b>flush</b> <b>cuts</b> were compared to stub cuts in a separate experiment. Cut surfaces were inoculated with copper-sensitive Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Pss) (10 to the 8 th cfu/ml). In 2010, the impact of natural and induced freeze events on canker progression was examined. Canker progression was assessed during the growing season. In 2008, bacteria were re-isolated from inoculated cuts and Pss identified with biochemical and PCR assays. In 2008, the efficacy of phosphite or copper against leaf scar infections generated by inoculating branches at 80 percent leaf drop was tested and bud blast assessed. In the 2008 - 2009 dormant season, six sweet cherry orchard planting systems and five cultivars were assessed visually for incidence of cankers to rate relative susceptibility. Laboratory experiments with detached shoots and green cherry fruit were conducted to determine pre-infection and post-infection activity of labeled or specified rates of copper hydroxide (standard), phosphite, Pentra Bark, kasugamycin, biological MOI- 106, biological yeast in proprietary buffer, oxytetracycline, urea, Bacillus subtilis, and hydrogen dioxide against Pss, compared to untreated. The isolate of Pss used for inoculum in the field experiments (Ps 34 collected by Burr from sweet cherry, Wayne County, NY) was submitted for genome sequencing. Three naturally-occurring, streptomycin resistant isolates of Pss were recovered from apple buds in Geneva, NY. Events: A 2009 Sweet Cherry Field Meeting and a 2010 Summer Fruit Tour held at NYSAES, Geneva, NY featured our research, reaching over 240 sweet cherry growers, nurserymen, industry personnel, consultants, educators and faculty. Services: We ruled out bacterial canker outbreaks at three orchards and verified bacterial canker at three orchards. Products: Copper and phosphite are essentially ineffective against bacterial infections of pruning cuts, pruning stubs may effectively contain canker infections, and cankers progress least when pruning is done after harvest. Flamout and Kasumin show activity against Pss infection in sweet cherry. We have a collection of contigs for the Ps 34 genome and a physical collection of 420 Pss isolates. Dissemination: Carroll provided research results to Cornell Cooperative Extension for summer and winter fruit schools for farmers and presented project results to scientists at the American Phytopathological Society, the Great Lakes Fruit Workers, and the Cumberland-Shenandoah Fruit Workers meetings...|$|R
