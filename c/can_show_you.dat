[...] As to showing you the varieties of those species, or of any of those phenomena that would aid one in getting at that mystery of mysteries, the origin of species, our space does not permit; but surely {{there ought to be a}} space somewhere, and, if not in the British Museum, where is it to be obtained?" ...|$|E
