2500|$|Making Bakelite was a {{multi-stage}} process. It {{began with}} the heating of phenol and formaldehyde {{in the presence of}} a catalyst such as hydrochloric acid, zinc chloride, or the base ammonia. This created a liquid <b>condensation</b> <b>product,</b> referred to as Bakelite A, which was soluble in alcohol, acetone, or additional phenol. [...] Heated further, the product became partially soluble and could still be softened by heat. Sustained heating resulted in an [...] "insoluble hard gum". [...] However, the high temperatures required to create this tended to cause violent foaming of the mixture, which resulted in the cooled material being porous and breakable. Baekeland's innovative step was to put his [...] "last condensation product" [...] into an egg-shaped [...] "Bakelizer". [...] By heating it under pressure, at about , Baekeland was able to suppress the foaming that would otherwise occur. The resulting substance was extremely hard and both infusible and insoluble.|$|E
