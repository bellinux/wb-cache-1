5|$|In {{its first}} year, the Referendum Party had little {{established}} organisation and largely remained a concept with limited concrete presence. Goldsmith's finances had allowed its appearance {{to be accompanied}} with mass publicity but it lacked the standard machinery of a political party, such as a mass membership or politically experienced personnel. To counter this problem, Goldsmith sought to create a sophisticated administrative centre and to secure the expertise {{to carry out a}} political campaign, establishing his headquarters in London. By October 1995, the party had established a hierarchical structure consisting of three tiers: the <b>centre,</b> <b>region</b> and constituency. Operating the centre was Goldsmith and a cabinet whose membership included Lord McAlpine, who was a former treasurer of the Conservative Party, and two former members of the Conservative Central Office staff. The centre had around 50 staff, who relayed Goldsmith's instructions through to the ten regional co-ordinators, who in turn transmitted them to the prospective candidates in the constituencies. This top-down and undemocratic structure concentrated decision making with Goldsmith and the centre and provided little autonomy for the regions and constituencies, although this was deemed necessary to ensure efficiency in its campaign.|$|E

40|$|Among all {{the visual}} {{features}} used for content-based image retrieval, colour {{is perhaps the}} most dominant and distinguishing one in many applications. Therefore in this research project, the concentration was focused on the colour property of images. In this work, a new histogram refinement technique, Large <b>Centre</b> <b>Regions</b> (LCR) Refinement, and a new region representation technique, LCR Sets, based on colour regions are presented. These methods extract a selected number of largest <b>regions</b> around the <b>centre</b> of the image and match other images emphasizing this property. Two assumptions are made. First is, that it can be assumed that the significant objects oritems of an image are often located at the centre. These objects can often be characterized by their colour. Hence an image retrieval technique which extracts the colours of large <b>centre</b> <b>regions</b> of an image would improve the retrieval performance for images with significant objects at the centre. The second is, that the techniques were tested on an image data base predominantly consisting of red images, but they perform similarly for other colours as well. The presented histogram refinement descriptor, Large-Centre-Regions Vector, effectively represents large <b>centre</b> <b>regions</b> of an image. In addition to this, LCR Sets represent basic information about the shape of a region. In the prototype, firstly, all the regions in an image were extracted depending on the similarity of the colour of the pixels. A centre zone was defined on the image and a selected number of largest regions which overlap with this centre zone at least by 50 % of the region area were selected as the Large-Centre-Regions for histogram refinement basis. In addition to large <b>centre</b> <b>regions,</b> LCR Sets represent the areas of a selected umber of largest regions lying outside the centre zone and the width to height ratio of the minimum bounding rectangle of each region. Since the largest <b>regions</b> at the <b>centre</b> are given the emphasis for matching, effect of the background can be minimized as well because most part of the background often lies outside the centre zone. Extra distinguishing capability among different images can be achieved with LCR Sets. Experimental results of LCR Refinement show much improved retrieval performance, especially for images with significant <b>regions</b> at the <b>centre.</b> Results show 20 % average improvement in ranks with LCR Refinement compared to Histogram. By combining LCR Sets with either Histogram or LCR Refinement, this can be further improved upto 26 % or 22 %, respectively...|$|R
