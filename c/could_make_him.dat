5|$|At the 2009 TGS event, it was {{revealed}} that Hope's silver hair was meant for Lightning, but when her hair color was decided as pink, Hope received the silver hair coloring instead. Hope's Academy uniform for XIII-2 was designed by Hideo Minaba. While he was portrayed as sensitive and vulnerable in XIII, for XIII-2, the game's director wished to portray Hope as a more mature, authoritative person. According to Toriyama, how Hope matured, as seen through Lightning's eyes, formed one of the main story themes for Lightning Returns. He was originally going to have a third unique design for the game, but the team eventually decided to settle on his original teenage appearance. In a later interview, he said that while the character was much liked by the team, he felt that Hope lacked the heroic image that <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> a leading character. Watanabe later said that he felt Hope helped complete Lightning's character and enable her to grow as a person. Hope is voiced by Vincent Martella in English and Yūki Kaji in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Fei {{sets out}} to destroy Deus and free the Wave Existence and Elly. In Merkaba, the party defeats Deus, but they realize that the energy {{released}} from the Wave Existence's shift will destroy the planet. Elly, inside Deus, tries to move {{it away from the}} planet and Fei, in his Xenogears, follows to save her, but both disappear in the rift. Krelian confronts them, telling Fei he only sought to end the pain and suffering that comes with human existence by reverting everything back to when it all began, when all was one, to ascend to the realm of God. Fei rejects Krelian's ideology with his love for Elly, but Krelian challenges Fei, telling him to prove this love that <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> independent of God, and calls forth Urobolus, a gigantic serpent-like incarnation of Miang. Xenogears appears and Fei uses it to defeat Urobolus. Krelian releases Elly and reveals to Fei that he had planned to become one with God along with Elly. During her time with Krelian, Elly had seen inside his heart and realized it was full of sadness and despair for all the atrocities he had committed. Despite everything, Elly says that Krelian truly loved people more than anyone else. Because no one will forgive his sins, he declines Fei's offer to return and ascends to a higher plain of existence along with the Wave Existence, telling Fei and Elly that he envies them. Fei and Elly then return to their planet along with Xenogears and reunite {{with the rest of the}} party.|$|E
25|$|In August 2017, {{the capital}} club {{activated}} the €222m release clause of Barcelona player Neymar, {{making him the}} most expensive transfer in football history. Later that month, PSG signed Kylian Mbappé from AS Monaco on loan with an option to buy for €180m that <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> the second-most expensive player in the world. As a result, UEFA opened a new FFP investigation into PSG.|$|E

25|$|In July 1808 Senyavin's ships, still {{blockaded}} in Lisbon by the British, were repeatedly {{visited by}} Duc d'Abrantès and General Kellermann, who exhorted him {{to assist in}} their military operations against the Portuguese and the Spaniards. To that Senyavin responded {{that he had not}} been authorized by the tsar to fight the peoples his country was not at war with and neither promises nor threats <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> change his mind.|$|E
25|$|Peter later {{introduces}} Neal to his team: Diana Lancing (later renamed Diana Berrigan), a young trainee {{agent who}} Peter trusts implicitly and Clinton Jones, a Harvard graduate and loyal junior agent. The FBI quickly seizes antique books that were {{intended for the}} Dutchman. The unlikely duo realize that the Dutchman is using the paper from the books to counterfeit 1944 Spanish Victory bonds, which <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> millions of dollars. Neal notices a nearly-microscopic signature on the fake bonds: the initials C.H.|$|E
25|$|Red Alert {{was one of}} the Autobots who {{originally}} came to Earth with Optimus Prime. His character was serious and extremely quiet. Almost nothing and nobody <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> to lose patience excepting Hot Shot who Red Alert often vainly asked to help him in his never-ending 'housekeeping' job on the Autobots' base. He was a brave and experienced warrior during the Cybertronian war, so that Optimus Prime himself gave him his due. But when on Earth, Red Alert hadn't many chances to show his fighting skill because his principal duty turned out to stay on the A-Base and {{to keep an eye on}} the kids (Rad, Carlos and Alexis) while the other 'Bots sought the Mini-Cons or fought the Decepticons. He acted mainly as the Autobots' chief supply manager, engineer and doctor, and was primarily responsible for rebuilding Smokescreen into Hoist, when the latter's body was nearly melted away after Megatron had fired the Requiem Blaster at him.|$|E

If he could only harden his heart sufficiently he could escape in that way. But he was not hard, and he did feel that so escaping, {{he would have a}} load on his breast which would make his life unendurable. Already he was beginning to hate the coast of Ireland, and to think that the gloom of Scroope Manor was preferable to it.|$|R

500|$|Of {{note for}} the Flames was their 12th round pick, Sergei Pryakhin. [...] The Soviet Ice Hockey Federation was {{expected}} to provide a list of players it {{would be willing to}} release to play in North America ahead of the draft, but that expectation failed to materialize. [...] Several Soviet players were drafted regardless, including Pryakhin. [...] General Manager Cliff Fletcher noted that Pryakhin had been dropped from the Soviet national team, and figured that decision <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> eligible to join the Flames. [...] Fletcher was able to complete negotiations with Soviet officials for the player, and Pryakhin became the first Soviet player permitted to play in the NHL, making his debut in Calgary on March 31, 1989.|$|E
500|$|Part of {{the story}} {{involves}} the character Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini), a Florentine policeman who learns [...] "Dr. Fell"'s true identity and realizes that this knowledge <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> rich. His escalating abandonment of morality allows him to countenance and facilitate {{the death of a}} gypsy pickpocket, egged on by the desire to have the best for his much younger wife. There is a moment in the film when Pazzi becomes corrupted, despite being what Scott describes as [...] "very thoughtful". Paul Krendler also succumbs to greed and corruption. Starling does not, however, and perseveres to the end, even refusing to release Lecter when she believes he is about to cut off her hand in order to free himself.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} Zero {{starring}} {{in his own}} series was proposed by Inafune. Inafune proposed that Zero star in his own series, and planned {{to go forward with}} the idea at the end of Mega Man X5. However, he was unable to after Capcom announced another Mega Man title without his involvement. Designed by Toru Nakayama of Inti Creates, Zero was meant to have a more [...] "human feel" [...] rather than the complete [...] "mechanical feel" [...] of the X series. Nakayama wanted the public to recognize that this series was different from the X series. Since Capcom wanted Zero's general structure to be the same, Inti-Creates concentrated on how different they <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>him,</b> rather than how similar. Zero's depiction in the series was intended to be morally ambiguous and depend on the perspective, appearing as a hero from one point of view and a terrorist from another.|$|E

500|$|Grant began {{experimenting with}} the drug LSD in the late 1950s, before it became popular. His wife, Betsy Drake, {{displayed}} {{a keen interest in}} psychotherapy, and through her Grant developed a considerable knowledge of the field of psychoanalysis. Radiologist Mortimer Hartman began treating him with LSD in the late 1950s, with Grant optimistic that the treatment <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> feel better about himself and rid of all of his inner turmoil stemming from his childhood and his failed relationships. He had an estimated 100 sessions over several years. For a long time, Grant viewed the drug positively, and stated that it was the solution after many years of [...] "searching for his peace of mind", and that for {{first time in his life}} he was [...] "truly, deeply and honestly happy". Cannon claimed during a court hearing, in which she claimed he was an [...] "apostle of LSD", that he was still taking the drug in 1967 as part of a remedy to save their relationship. Grant later admitted that [...] "taking LSD was an utterly foolish thing to do but I was a self-opinionated boor, hiding all kinds of layers and defences, hypocrisy and vanity. I had to get rid of them and wipe the slate clean".|$|E
500|$|In his speeches, Aeschines uses pederastic {{relations}} of Demosthenes {{as a means}} to attack him. In the case of Aristion, a youth from Plataea who lived {{for a long time in}} Demosthenes' house, Aeschines mocks the [...] "scandalous" [...] and [...] "improper" [...] relation. In another speech, Aeschines brings up the pederastic relation of his opponent with a boy called Cnosion. The slander that Demosthenes' wife also slept with the boy suggests that the relationship was contemporary with his marriage.* C. A. Cox, Household Interests, 202. Aeschines claims that Demosthenes made money out of young rich men, such as Aristarchus, the son of Moschus, whom he allegedly deceived with the pretence that he <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> a great orator. Apparently, while still under Demosthenes' tutelage, Aristarchus killed and mutilated a certain Nicodemus of Aphidna. Aeschines accused Demosthenes of complicity in the murder, pointing out that Nicodemus had once pressed a lawsuit accusing Demosthenes of desertion. He also accused Demosthenes of having been such a bad erastes to Aristarchus so as not even to deserve the name. His crime, according to Aeschines, was to have betrayed his eromenos by pillaging his estate, allegedly pretending to be in love with the youth so as to get his hands on the boy's inheritance. Nevertheless, the story of Demosthenes' relations with Aristarchus is still regarded as more than doubtful, and no other pupil of Demosthenes is known by name.* A.W. Pickard, Demosthenes and the Last Days of Greek Freedom, 15.|$|E

Gretsch agreed, and the result is the blonde twelve-string electric that Nesmith used during the entire Monkees series, in the recording studio, and in concert. Meanwhile, Fred Gretsch liked the finished instrument so much that he put the model into production. One of the first was given to George Harrison and was later known as the [...] "George Harrison Model". Harrison, preferring his Rickenbacker twelve-string, gave the guitar to a friend.|$|E

Sell was ordered to be hospitalized to determine whether {{he would be able}} to become competent so as to allow his trial to proceed. While in the hospital, Sell refused to take the antipsychotic medication prescribed by the Medical Center staff. The Medical Center sought to involuntarily medicate Sell. On June 9, 1999, an administrative hearing was held before a medical hearing officer who concluded that antipsychotic medication was the treatment of choice based on the fact that Dr. Sell's [...] "delusional thinking <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> dangerous." [...] Sell filed a court challenge to stop the hospital's decision to give him the drug involuntarily.|$|E

Kovačić revealed that precisely Prosinečki is the player he admired the most while growing up. His compatriot, Zvonimir Boban, who played for Milan for over a decade, in an interview with Sky Italia (in 2013) said, [...] "He has talents that <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> even better than me, he is an incredibly serious professional for someone his age. Kovačić is a complete player. He is not a born regista but he is playing there now. He is a complete talent that can still grow— he has incredible potential." [...] Trapattoni described him as [...] "a mixture of Kaká and Clarence Seedorf", because of his style of play and technical characteristics. Long-time Inter captain Javier Zanetti stated that, with the exception of Ronaldo, who had arrived to Inter when he was 21, Kovačić was the most promising youngster he had seen in his 19 years at the club.|$|E

2500|$|The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences praised Portal for its [...] "hint of comedy", citing GLaDOS' [...] "humorous and homicidal" [...] personality. Writer Lou Kesten, in {{discussing}} humor in video games, cited GLaDOS as possibly {{being the first}} time he discovered that video games <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> laugh out loud. The New York Times editor Charles Herold praised GLaDOS, calling her comments [...] "wildly funny". In an article titled [...] "The GLaDOS Effect - Can Antagonists Rule the World?", Gamasutra publisher Simon Carless describes her as the one true memorable character from Portal. He states that she is the reason he keeps returning to play Portal, describing her as funny, unexpected, and beguiling. The Daily Telegraphs Tom Hoggins wrote that GLaDOS [...] "became one of gaming’s most compelling villains" [...] and that [...] "it managed to get people attached to an inanimate cube. It had the best end credits song of all time. It was funny, smart, fresh and managed to feel like the plucky, accidental hero". GameSpy's Nathan Meunier wrote that [...] "without inhuman antagonist GLaDOS spewing a laugh-inducing tirade of thinly veiled threats in her deadpan robotic drone as you progress deeper into the bowels of Aperture Science, Portal would have been a very different game".|$|E
