40|$|Polyvinylpyrrolidone/ 1 -triacontene (PVP/TA) <b>copolymer</b> <b>fibre</b> webs {{produced}} by centrifugal melt spinning were studied {{to determine the}} influence of jet rotation speed on morphology and internal structure as well as their potential utility as adsorbent capture media for disperse dye effluents. Fibres were produced at 72 C with jet head rotation speeds from 7000 to 15, 000 r min- 1. The fibres were characterised by means of SEM, XRD and DSC. Adsorption behaviour was investigated by means of an isothermal bottle point adsorption study using a commercial disperse dye, Dianix AC-E. Through centrifugal spinning nanofibers and microfibers could be produced with individual fibres as fine as 200 – 300 nm and mean fibre diameters of ca. 1 – 2 lm. The PVP/TA fibres were mechanically brittle with characteristic brittle tensile fracture regions observed at the fibre ends. DSC and XRD analyses suggested that this brittleness was linked to the graft chain crystallisation where the PVP/TA was {{in the form of a}} radial brush copolymer. In this structure, the triacontene branches interlock and form small lateral crystals around an amorphous backbone. As an adsorbent, the PVP/TA fibres were found to adsorb 35. 4 mg g- 1 compared to a benchmark figure of 30. 0 mg g- 1 for a granular-activated carbon adsorbent under the same application conditions. PVP/TA is highly hydrophobic and adsorbs disperse dyes through the strong ‘‘hydrophobic bonding’’ interaction. Such fibrous assemblies may have applications in the targeted adsorption and separation of non-polar species from aqueous or polar environments...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundWound {{dehiscence}} and incisional hernia {{are potentially}} serious complications following abdominal surgery, especially if performed through a midline incision. Although prophylactic reinforcement with on-lay mesh {{has been shown}} to reduce this risk, a permanent mesh carries the risk of seroma formation, infection and persistent pain. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the safety of a resorbable on-lay mesh to reinforce the midline suturein patients with high risk for wound dehiscence or incisional hernia. MethodSixteen patients with three or more risk factors for wound dehiscence or incisional hernia were included. A TIGR® Matrix mesh, composed of a mixture of 40 % <b>copolymer</b> <b>fibres</b> of polyglycolide, polylactide, and polytrimethylene carbonate and 60 % <b>copolymer</b> <b>fibres</b> of polylactide, and polytrimethylene carbonate, was placed on the aponeurosis with an overlap of 5 on either side, and fixated with continuous monofilament polydioxanone suture. All postoperative complications were registered at clinical follow-up. ResultsMean follow-up was nine months. One patient developed a seroma that needed drainage and antibiotic treatment. One patient had a wound infection that needed antibiotic treatment. There was no complication requiring a reoperation. No wound dehiscence or incisional hernia was seen. ConclusionOn-lay placement of TIGR® Matrix is safe, and may provide a feasible way of reinforcing the suture line in patients with high risk for postoperative wound dehiscence or incisional hernia. Larger samples are required, however, if one is to draw any conclusion regarding the safety and effectiveness of this technique,...|$|R
40|$|The {{photosensitivity}} of <b>copolymer</b> optical <b>fibre</b> preform is analysed {{in comparison}} with the doped one. The effects of write conditions such as pump power and pump time have been studied. Then, the preform is drawn into single mode polymer optical fibre with core refractive index of 1. 499, and core-cladding refractive-index difference of 0. 008. Long-period birefringence gratings with period of 120 um are fabricated in the fibre. The duty cycle is 50 %, and the refractive index change in the exposed area is about 1 × 10 - 3.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop {{biodegradable}} devices loaded with chemotherapy drug. The system is targeted for advanced ovarian cancer treatment through the intraperitoneal (IP) route of administration. Polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) {{was selected as the}} model biodegradable polymer to produce drug-loaded microsphere, hollow and solid <b>fibres.</b> <b>Copolymer</b> PLGA with three different lactic:glycolic acids ratios; 50 : 50, 65 : 35 and 75 : 25 were used in order to compare their drug loading capacities and in vitro drug release profiles. Cisplatin, a cytotoxic drug with proven activity against ovarian cancer was selected as the model chemotherapy drug. Intraperitoneal administration is often associated with abdominal pain therefore a local anaesthetic, lidocaine, was selected for the purpose of pain relief.

40|$|Strength and {{engineering}} properties of three generic repair materials which {{are likely to}} influence long-term performance of repaired concrete structures were studied. Measured properties include strength, stiffness, shrinkage and creep deformations, together with the complete compressive stress-strain characteristics including post-cracking behaviour. The repair materials considered in this investigation are commercially available and widely used. These included a high performance non-shrinkable concrete, a mineral based cementitious material with no additives or coarse aggregate size particles, and a cementitious mortar containing styrene acrylic <b>copolymer</b> with <b>fibre</b> additives. Performance comparisons are also made between these materials and plain concrete mixes of similar strength and stiffness, suitable for repair applications. The results show that shrinkage of the repair materials was significantly greater than the shrinkage of normal concrete. Moreover, the shrinkage of those modified with a polymer admixture {{was found to be}} very sensitive to the relative humidity of the exposure compared to normal concrete. The post-peak strain capacity of the material modified with a polymer admixture was markedly improved leading to a more pronounced falling branch of stress-strain curve. The ultimate stress level (at a maximum load) of specially formulated repair materials varies significantly, the lowest ultimate stress being recorded for the porous mineral-based material. The inclusion of aggregates improves the mechanical properties and dimensional stability of repair materials. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Tissue {{engineering}} {{has recently}} {{been identified as a}} suitable tool to develop replacements for the tympanic membrane. This study aimed at investigating PEOT/PBT copolymer scaffolds obtained via electrospinning as potential eardrum substitutes using an in vitro approach. Study design: PEOT/PBT <b>copolymer</b> ultrafine <b>fibre</b> meshes were manufactured and characterized for morphology and pore features. The scaffolds were cultured with human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) under a dynamic flow regimen to improve cell infiltration and viability. The expression of basic extracellular matrix molecules was evaluated and compared to that of the human eardrum. Finally, the interaction between human tympanic membrane keratinocytes and the scaffolds was investigated. Results: The electrospun scaffolds had a fibre diameter of 1. 9 ± 0. 9 mm, thickness of 220 ± 56 mm, and porosity of 80 %± 0. 8 %. The macroporous meshes were suitable for cell infiltration, since 83. 3 % of relative void volume was from pores of 3 - 300 -mm size. Over a four week culture, the bioreactor always increased the viability of human MSCs in the scaffolds with respect to traditional multi-well plate cultures. Viability was best at two weeks in culture, so this time-point was selected for further morphological and histochemical analyses. In static cultures, the human MSCs interacted with the top surface of the fibrous scaffold, while in dynamic cultures they infiltrated the mesh up to 240 -mm depth. Adherent human MSCs maintained a non-differentiated phenotype, as shown by a very low production of glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins, which are conversely highly expressed in the eardrum connective tissue layer. Human tympanic membrane keratinocytes adhered to the scaffold surface and were viable after 48 h. Conclusion: Using electrospinning combined with bioreactor culture appeared an efficient approach to develop biohybrid eardrum replacements in vitro, suitable for re-epithelialization in vivo. © 2015 International Association of Physicians in Audiology...|$|R
