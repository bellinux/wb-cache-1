40|$|ABSTRACT: The hole {{drilling}} method {{has been used for}} measurement of the residual stresses in various materials. The released strains measured by the {{hole drilling}} method are converted to residual stresses using <b>calibration</b> <b>factors.</b> There is a standard for the {{hole drilling method}} for isotropic materials. Also for orthotropic materials, there are various methods for converting the released strains to residual stresses. In these methods the numbers of <b>calibration</b> <b>factors</b> vary from two to nine (a three by three matrix). In this article, <b>calibration</b> <b>factors</b> of the orthotropic plates are determined based on an exact solution method. For this purpose, assuming a plane stress condition, stresses and strains around the area under a rosette strain gage mounted to an orthotropic plate are calculated. A hole {{in the center of the}} rosette strain gage changes the distribution of the stresses and strains. Using the closed form solution proposed in this research the released strains and the <b>calibration</b> <b>factors</b> are calculated, and the residual stresses are found. Also, <b>calibration</b> <b>factors</b> for any orthotropic material with any level of orthotropy are calculated. These factors are independent of the loading and depend on the material properties of orthotropic materials and the ratio of the rosette diameter to the hole diameter. The material properties and the ratio of the rosette diameter to the hole diameter are considered in the equations, therefore there is no need for presenting the results in tabular form or any interpolations. The results for an orthotropic unidirectional ply made of carbon/epoxy are presented. Also, the <b>calibration</b> <b>factors</b> for three different unidirectional composites are calculated. The results obtained from the proposed closed form solution are compared with the simulated hole drilling method. A good agreement between the results shows the reliability of the closed form solution presented in this study...|$|R

5000|$|Due to the {{constant}} perfusion of the microdialysis probe with fresh perfusate, a total equilibrium cannot be established. This results in dialysate concentrations that are lower than those measured at the distant sampling site. In order to correlate concentrations measured in the dialysate with those present at the distant sampling site, a <b>calibration</b> <b>factor</b> (recovery) is needed. The recovery can be determined at steady-state using {{the constant}} rate of analyte exchange across the microdialysis membrane. The rate at which an analyte is exchanged across the semipermeable membrane is generally expressed as the analyte’s extraction efficiency. The extraction efficiency {{is defined as the}} ratio between the loss/gain of analyte during its passage through the probe (Cin−Cout) and the difference in concentration between perfusate and distant sampling site (Cin−Csample).In theory, the extraction efficiency of a microdialysis probe can be determined by: 1) changing the drug concentrations while keeping the flow rate constant or 2) changing the flow rate while keeping the respective drug concentrations constant. At steady-state, the same extraction efficiency value is obtained, no matter if the analyte is enriched or depleted in the perfusate. [...] Microdialysis probes can consequently be calibrated by either measuring the loss of analyte using drug-containing perfusate or the gain of analyte using drug-containing sample solutions. To date, the most frequently used calibration methods are the low-flow-rate method, the no-net-flux method, the dynamic (extended) no-net-flux method, and the retrodialysis method. [...] The proper selection of an appropriate calibration method is critically important for the success of a microdialysis experiment. Supportive in vitro experiments prior to the use in animals or humans are therefore recommended. [...] In addition, the recovery determined in vitro may differ from the recovery in humans. Its actual value therefore needs to be determined in every in vivo experiment.|$|E

40|$|The <b>calibration</b> <b>factor</b> for a {{continuous}} monitor that uses gross alpha-particle counting for measuring radon progeny concentration theoretically should vary {{as a function}} of the relative concentrations of the radon progeny; therefore, an inherent error is introduced by using a constant <b>calibration</b> <b>factor,</b> regardless of the equilibrium condition, as is the practice for most models of radon progeny monitor. An equation was derived describing the <b>calibration</b> <b>factor</b> {{as a function of}} the concentrations of the radon progeny and was used to calculate values of the <b>calibration</b> <b>factor</b> over the entire theoretical range of relative concentrations of radon progeny that comprise a constant collective radon progeny concentration. The results of these calculations showed that the <b>calibration</b> <b>factor</b> varies by approximately 10 % over the entire theoretical range of relative concentrations of radon progeny. The range of relative concentrations that typically exist in indoor air is a small subset of the entire range that is theoretically possible; therefore, the <b>calibration</b> <b>factor</b> varies, in practice, due to this effect by less than 10 % and the inherent error introduced by the detection and analysis method is not serious. Loss of radon progeny, particularly 218 ~ 0, due to plateout on surfaces of the monitor before the progeny are collected on the filter has the effect of lowering the value of the <b>calibration</b> <b>factor.</b> This effect can be significant at conditions of low equilibrium when the fraction of radon progeny that are unattached to aerosols in the air is increased and plateout is more likely to occur...|$|E
30|$|In {{the context}} of absorbed dose {{calculation}} for targeted radionuclide therapy or {{for the evaluation of}} the tumor response to therapy, {{it is important that the}} measurement be repeatable and the factor stable over time in order to provide accurate absolute activity quantification. However, the repeatability of the <b>calibration</b> <b>factor</b> measurement and its stability over time have not been carefully investigated, and little information can be found in the literature about factors impacting its variability. Thus, we studied the variability of the <b>calibration</b> <b>factor</b> measurement using data from a series of patient 131 I-tositumomab[*]+[*]unlabeled tositumomab (Bexxar®, GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, England) radionuclide therapy procedures and quality control measurements obtained over a period of 4  years. The <b>calibration</b> <b>factor</b> was measured by a dual-camera whole-body anterior-posterior scan of an in-air calibration source and was performed for each patient acquisition. This served as the raw data on <b>calibration</b> <b>factor</b> stability and repeatability. This work focused on the assessment of the repeatability of this in-air <b>calibration</b> <b>factor</b> measurement over a long time period and on the factors affecting its repeatability by analyzing sources of variability. One factor evaluated was the quantitative stability of the SPECT camera over time, which has a direct effect on the stability of the <b>calibration</b> <b>factor.</b> As a proxy for this, we used the count rate measured in daily extrinsic 57 Co flood acquisitions performed as part of a routine quality control program. Since this was measured using a different radionuclide and collimator, it assesses only the radionuclide and collimator independent component of camera sensitivity variations. Since the activities in the calibration sources used for calibration were measured using a radionuclide activity meter, radionuclide activity meter variability may also impact the <b>calibration</b> <b>factor</b> calculation. To assess this, we used results of daily radionuclide activity meter constancy measurements. Finally, the variable radiation environment in the SPECT camera room may also be a factor affecting the variability of the <b>calibration</b> <b>factor</b> measurement. To quantify this effect, we used background measurements routinely acquired as part of the radionuclide therapy protocol. Using these data, we performed a number of statistical analyses to evaluate the importance of the various potential sources of variation and the overall stability of the <b>calibration</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E
