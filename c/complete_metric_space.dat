As such they are topological vector spaces, in which topological notions like the openness and closedness of subsets are well-defined. Of special importance {{is the notion}} of a closed linear subspace of a Hilbert space that, with the inner product induced by restriction, is also complete (being a closed set in a <b>complete</b> <b>metric</b> <b>space)</b> and therefore a Hilbert space in its own right.|$|E
