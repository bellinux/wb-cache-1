50|$|In digital photography, {{the crop}} factor, format factor or focal length {{multiplier}} {{of an image}} sensor format is {{the ratio of the}} dimensions of a <b>camera's</b> <b>imaging</b> area compared to a reference format; most often, this term is applied to digital cameras, relative to 35 mm film format as a reference. In the case of digital <b>cameras,</b> the <b>imaging</b> device would be a digital sensor. The most commonly used definition of crop factor is the ratio of a 35 mm frame's diagonal (43.3 mm) to the diagonal of the image sensor in question; that is, CF=diag35mm / diagsensor. Given the same 3:2 aspect ratio as 35mm's 36 mm × 24 mm area, this is equivalent to the ratio of heights or ratio of widths; the ratio of sensor areas is the square of the crop factor.|$|R

50|$|There are a {{total of}} four known types of {{optronics}} FCS that have been publicized, and all of them share similar components for most parts. The common components of all three types include color daytime TV camera, night vision <b>camera,</b> <b>imaging</b> infrared camera. The earliest sample is the cheapest, with a laser range finder for HJ-8 and similar wire-guided missiles. A more advanced version appeared shortly after, with a laser range finding and targeting system for laser beam riding missiles such as HJ-9. The latest version currently in service has a laser ranger / designator for semi-active laser guided missiles such as HJ-9A and HJ-10. The most recent system that is currently under development incorporates a laser ranging / targeting system that can perform all of the functions previously handled by separate system, and this latest developmental type is also the most expensive and bulkiest one of all. During the 10th 5-yr plan, the 602nd Research Institute was tasked to develop a mast-mounting system for the optronics FCS, which was successfully completed in 2003 (test flew on Harbin Z-9). The optronics FCS is fully compatible and can be slaved to the pilots’ HMS/HMD, and the seekers of the missiles can also be slaved to the FCS.|$|E

In gait analysis, planar X-ray studies are done in the sagittal plane to allow for highly accurate tracking of large movements. Methods have been developed to allow for estimating all six degrees of freedom of movement from a planar X-ray and a model of the tracked object.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Standard {{optical flow}} methods for motion or {{disparity}} estimation use a brightness constancy constraint equation (BCCE). This BCCE either handles a moving <b>camera</b> <b>imaging</b> a non-moving scene or a fixed <b>camera</b> <b>imaging</b> a moving scene. In this paper a BCCE is developed {{that can handle}} instantaneous motion of the camera on a 2 D plane normal to the viewing direction and motion of the imaged scene. From the thus acquired up to 5 dimensional data set 3 D object motion, 3 D surface element position, and-normals can be estimated simultaneously. Experiments using 1 d or 2 d camera grids and a weighted total least squares (TLS) estimation scheme demonstrate performance in terms of systematic error and noise stability, and show technical implications. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} {{several types of}} imaging: radio tomography, single scattering optical tomography, photoacoustic tomography, and Compton <b>camera</b> <b>imaging.</b> Each of these tomographic techniques leads to a Radon-type transform: radio tomography brings about an elliptical Radon transform, single scattering optical tomography reduces to the V-line Radon transform, and photoacoustic tomography with line detectors boils down to a cylindrical Radon transform. We also introduce a different Radon-type transform arising in photo acoustic tomography with circular detectors, and study mathematically similar object, a toroidal Radon transform. We also consider the cone transform arising in Compton <b>camera</b> <b>imaging</b> {{as well as the}} windowed ray transform. We provide inversion formulas for all these transforms. When given some Radon- type transform, we are interested not only in inversion formulas, but also in range conditions, and stability. We thus address range conditions, a stability estimate for some of the Radon-type transforms above...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} whereby {{large numbers of}} human lymphocytes are separated from peripheral blood and labelled in vitro with indium- 111 oxine. Following autologous reinjection, the distribution within the body is followed by means of serial blood samples, surface-probe counting and gamma <b>camera</b> <b>imaging.</b> The distribution of radioactivity following reinjection of heat-damaged labelled lymphocytes and free indium- 111 oxine {{is different from that}} of 'normal' lymphocytes. The results suggest that the separation and labelling procedure does not cause significant physical damage to the lymphocytes The importance of restricting the specific lymphocyte activity to 20 - 40 microCi per 10 (8) cells in order to minimize radiation damage to the lymphocytes is emphasized. Good resolution of lymphoid structures is obtained using gamma <b>camera</b> <b>imaging</b> and the changes recorded in organ distribution correlate well with data from animal models of lymphocyte migration.
