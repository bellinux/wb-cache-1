A paleoresource {{is one that has}} little or no demand for the material extracted from it; an obsolescent material, humans no longer need it. The classic paleoresource is an arrowhead-grade flint resource; no one makes flint arrowheads or spearheads anymore—making a sharpened piece of scrap steel and using it is much simpler. Obsolescent products include tin cans, tin foil, the schoolhouse slate blackboard, and radium in medical technology.

However, because of the surcharge {{that would have to}} be passed to subscribers by carrying SportsChannel as a part-time premium/basic service, the plan did not sit well with some providers such as Cencom Cable Associates (which served parts of the western San Gabriel Valley, including Pasadena) and Paragon <b>Cable</b> (<b>covering</b> the suburbs of Torrance and Garden Grove), which decided to drop the network altogether.|$|E
5000|$|Although Romania started DVB-T Broadcasting in 2005 {{with the}} MPEG-2 {{standard}} for SD broadcast and MPEG 4 for HD, {{it was only}} experimental. In June 2011 Romania shifted to MPEG4 both for SD and HD. In 2012, the Romanian authorities decided that DVB-T2 will be the standard used for terrestrial broadcasts, as it allows {{a larger number of}} programs to be broadcast on the same multiplex. Romania's switchover plans were initially delayed due to economical and feasibility-related reasons. One of the reasons was that most Romanian consumers already extensively used either cable or satellite services, which developed very quickly and became very popular after 1990. In fact, a technological boom started around 2003, driven by a solid economical development in the field of telecommunications, made several private operators create large networks of fiber optics and <b>cable</b> <b>covering</b> all of Romania, which are now used for providing both TV, telephony, and high quality broadband internet. As the prices for complete packages (TV, internet, telephony) are low and the quality quite good (e.g. about 20 EUR for 500Mbit/s internet, ~120 SD and HD digital cable TV channels and telephony, with an added 2-4 EUR for mobile telephony), the interest for over-the-air TV quickly became very low. There are rumors that commercial broadcasters that traditionally transmitted over-the-air using analogue channels (like MediaPro, Antena GROUP, Prima TV) will give up terrestrial broadcasting and will be available only on pay-TV services, like cable, satellite and IPTV [...] It is also rumored that the DVB-T standard (with MPEG-4 encoding [...] ) will continue until 2018 [...]|$|E

25|$|LLDPE {{is defined}} by a density range of 0.915–0.925nbsp&g/cm3. LLDPE is a {{substantially}} linear polymer with significant numbers of short branches, commonly made by copolymerization of ethylene with short-chain alpha-olefins (for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene, and 1-octene). LLDPE has higher tensile strength than LDPE, and it exhibits higher impact and puncture resistance than LDPE. Lower thickness (gauge) films can be blown, compared with LDPE, with better environmental stress-cracking resistance, but is not as easy to process. LLDPE is used in packaging, particularly film for bags and sheets. Lower thickness may be used compared to LDPE. It is used for <b>cable</b> <b>coverings,</b> toys, lids, buckets, containers, and pipe. While other applications are available, LLDPE is used predominantly in film applications due to its toughness, flexibility, and relative transparency. Product examples range from agricultural films, Saran wrap, and bubble wrap, to multilayer and composite films. In 2013, the world LLDPE market reached a volume of US$40 billion.|$|R

40|$|Wire and <b>cable</b> <b>coverings</b> are {{potentially}} {{a major cause}} of fire in buildings and other installations. As they need to breach fire walls and are frequently located in vertical ducting, they have significant potential to increase the fire hazard. It is therefore important to understand the ignition and burning characteristics of cables by developing a model capable of predicting their burning behaviour for a range of scenarios. The fire performance of electrical cables is usually dominated by the fire performance of the sheathing materials. The complexity of the problem increases when cable sheathing incorporates fire retardants. One-dimensional pyrolysis models have been constructed for cable sheathing materials, based on milligram-scale and bench-scale test data by comparing the performance of three different software tools (ThermaKin, Comsol Multiphysics and FDS, version 6. 0. 1). Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were conducted on powdered cable coatings to determine the thermal degradation mechanism, the enthalpy of decomposition reactions, and the heat capacities of all apparent species. The emissivity and the in-depth absorption coefficient were determined using reflectance and transmittance measurements, with dispersive and non-dispersive spectrometers and integrating spheres. Bench-scale tests were conducted with a mass loss calorimeter flushed with nitrogen on samples in a horizontal orientation, for comparison with the pyrolysis model of non-flaming decomposition at an external heat flux of 50 kW m- 2. The parameters determined through analysis of the milligram-scale data were used to construct a pyrolysis model that predicted the total mass loss from calorimeter tests in anaerobic conditions. A condensed phase pyrolysis model that accurately predicts in-depth temperature profiles of a solid fuel, and the mass flux of volatiles evolved during degradation of the fuel, is an essential component of a comprehensive fire model, which when coupled to a computational fluid dynamics code can be used to predict the burning processes in a fire scenario. Pyrolysis models vary considerably in complexity based on the assumptions incorporated into the development of the model...|$|R
