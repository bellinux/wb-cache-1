500|$|Murray's speech, [...] "Jim Crow and Jane Crow", {{was given}} during Lyndon B. Johnson's presidency. It {{primarily}} addresses {{an audience of}} African-American women. [...] Pauli Murray acknowledges the fact that African-American women always {{have contributed to the}} progress of the Civil Rights Movement. She asserted that African-American women have worked just as hard as, if not harder than, African-American men to achieve equal rights among black people and white people. According to Murray, [...] "Not only have they stood...with Negro men in every phase of the battle, but they have also continued to stand when their men were destroyed by it." [...] The black women decided to [...] "...continue......" [...] for their freedom and liberty even when [...] "...their men..." [...] began to experience exhaustion from a long struggle for civil rights. These women were unafraid to stand up for what they believed in and refused to back down from the long and tedious [...] "battle". [...] Murray continued her praise for black women when she stated that [...] "...one cannot help asking: would the Negro struggle have <b>come</b> <b>this</b> <b>far</b> without the indomitable determination of its women?" [...] The [...] "Negro struggle" [...] was able to progress partly because of [...] "...the indomitable determination of its women." [...] African-American women were vital to the Civil Rights Movement and pushed it forward with their own might. They were just as important to the black struggle for racial justice as their male counterparts. Their work ethic and persistence defined African-American women as important to a long fight against racism in America.|$|E

At one point, Larsen wondered [...] "if we had <b>come</b> <b>this</b> <b>far</b> only to be crushed like a nut on a shoal and then buried by the ice." [...] The ship and all but one of her crew survived the winter on Boothia Peninsula.

2500|$|Ellison was {{recalled}} to the squad, but {{omitted from}} the XI for the fourth Test at Old Trafford, [...] "fortunately", in his opinion: [...] "I say [...] fortunately because I never liked bowling at Old Trafford; {{it was more of}} a [...] spinner's wicket." [...] Only 24 wickets fell in the match, and both Jonathan Agnew and Paul Allott, rivals for a fast-bowling place, went wicketless. In the event, both Agnew and Allot were {{omitted from the}} next XI and Ellison was recalled for the fifth test. He remembers: [...] "When we got to Edgbaston I was advised not to play by Bernard Thomas (England physio) as I had a heavy cold. He thought I would not get through five days.

2500|$|Different Test playing {{nations had}} {{different}} point of view about this structural change in the way Test Cricket has been played.

[...] "We believe that more we play against competitive sides, the better we will get. If we didn't play against better standard sides in ODIs, we wouldn't have <b>come</b> <b>this</b> <b>far.</b> We were the king of the jungle from where we achieved the Test status. We were given a reality check when we were promoted to the highest level. I feel that if we go backwards, our cricket will regress." [...] Should this happen, Bangladesh, who are ranked ninth, are likely to slip into Division Two and settle for lesser Tests against top cricketing nations.|$|E

60|$|Suddenly Tara, {{who stood}} close beside him, {{clutched}} {{his arm and}} pointed toward a {{far corner of the}} room. Gahan looked and looking felt the hairs upon his neck rising.

Not gently had they moved as a draught might have moved them had there been a draught, but suddenly they had bulged out as though pushed against from behind. To the opposite corner backed Gahan until they stood with their backs against the hangings there, and then hearing the approach of their pursuers across the chamber beyond Gahan pushed Tara through the hangings and, following her, kept open with his left hand, which he had disengaged from the girl's grasp, a tiny opening through which he could view the apartment and the doorway upon the opposite side through which the pursuers would enter, if they <b>came</b> <b>this</b> <b>far.</b>|$|R
