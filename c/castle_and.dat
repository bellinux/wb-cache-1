5|$|Alexander died in 1944, and {{the death}} duties proved {{crippling}} to Geoffrey. In 1949 he sold the <b>castle</b> <b>and</b> 3,480 hectares (8,600acres) of the lands to the Ashdale Property Company, retaining a tenancy of the castle for himself. The Crown Estate bought the estate from Ashdale and sold the castle back to Geoffrey in 1954. His son Colonel Walter Luttrell lived away from Dunster, and {{following the death of}} his mother– the last Luttrell to live in the property– gave the <b>castle</b> <b>and</b> most of its contents to the National Trust in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Arrowslits, also {{commonly}} called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts {{to be fired}} on attackers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but {{the size of the}} opening could also impede the defender if it was too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming. Sometimes a sally port was included; this could allow the garrison to leave the <b>castle</b> <b>and</b> engage besieging forces. It was usual for the latrines to empty down the external walls of a <b>castle</b> <b>and</b> into the surrounding ditch.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} scheme, in 1283 Edward {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of new castles and walled towns across the occupied territories, in part to encourage substantial migration to the region from England. Amongst these were the future World Heritage sites of Caernarfon <b>Castle</b> <b>and</b> its walled town, overlooking the River Seiont; Conwy <b>Castle</b> <b>and</b> its walled town, controlling a crossing point over the River Conwy; and Harlech Castle, protecting a sea port and newly established English town. Plans were probably made to establish a <b>castle</b> <b>and</b> walled settlement near the strategically important town of Llanfaes on Anglesey – the future Beaumaris – but were postponed due to the costs of the other projects.|$|E

5|$|During the 15th and 16th centuries Framlingham was at {{the heart}} of the estates of the {{powerful}} Mowbray and Howard families. Two artificial meres were built around the castle, which was expanded in fashionable brick. With a large, wealthy household to maintain, the castle purchased supplies from across England and brought in luxury goods from international markets. Extensive pleasure gardens were built within the <b>castle</b> <b>and</b> older parts redesigned to allow visitors to enjoy the resulting views. By the end of the 16th century, however, the castle fell into disrepair and after the final Howard owner, Theophilus, entered into financial difficulties the <b>castle</b> <b>and</b> the surrounding estates were sold off.|$|E

Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 and initially granted Dartmouth <b>Castle,</b> <b>and</b> the former annual subsidy, to the town once again. By 1662, however, the fortifications in Dartmouth were garrisoned by a royal force of 23 men and Sir John, who continued in his post as captain and governor until 1677. Fears of a Dutch and French attack resulted in the castle being maintained until the 1690s.|$|E
