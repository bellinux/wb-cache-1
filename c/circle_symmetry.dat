40|$|A {{computer}} model of flagella in which oscillation results from regulation of active sliding force by sliding velocity can simulate {{the movements of}} very short flagella and cilia. Of particular interest are {{the movements of the}} short (2 – 3 µm) nodal cilia of the mammalian embryo, which determine the development of the asymmetry of the internal organs. These cilia must generate a counterclockwise (viewed from base to tip) circling motion. A three-dimensional {{computer model}}, with active force generated by a simple mathematical formulation and regulated by sliding velocity, can generate this circling motion if a time delay process is included in the control specification. Without the introduction of a symmetrybreaking mechanism, the computer models start randomly in either direction, and maintain either clockwise or counterclockwise <b>circling.</b> <b>Symmetry</b> can be broken by at least two mechanisms: (1) control of dynein activity on one outer doublet by sliding velocity can be influenced by the sliding velocity experienced on an adjacent outer doublet, or (2) a constant twist of the axoneme caused by an off-axis component of dynein force. This second mechanism appears more reasonable, but its effectiveness is highly dependent upon specifications for the elastic resistances of the model. These symmetry-breaking mechanisms need to be present only at the beginning of circling. With these models, once a circling direction is established, it remains stable even if the symmetry-breaking mechanism is removed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fast algorithm for computing local symmetry descriptions of region shape. Like previous algorithms, it extracts groups of edge points tangent {{to a common}} circle. However, by examining the number of distinct points of tangency, the new algorithm separates groups belonging to round regions from those belonging to elongated regions. Thus, when these relations are connected to form extended regions, round and elongated regions can be processed differently. The new implementation uses an edge-tracking algorithm to build extended regions. This handles the effects of limited precision and shape irregularities better than axistracking methods. In particular, Blum's idea of locating SAT branch points can be converted into a practical method of detecting locations at which three or more regions join. By combining a new density constraint with constraints used previously, the output {{and much of the}} processing is made linear in the image area. One method of representing region shapes is to extract symmetry sets, 1 i. e. sets of edge points tangent to a common <b>circle</b> (the <b>symmetry</b> <b>circle),</b> and then group these sets into extended regions (Figure 1). These local symmetry relationships form a intermediate representation between raw edge points and descriptions of whole regions.

40|$|Single photon {{emission}} computed tomography (SPECT) {{is a well}} established clinical tool for functional imaging. A limitation of current SPECT systems {{is the use of}} mechanical collimation, where {{only a small fraction of}} the emitted photons is actually used for image reconstruction. This results in large noise level and finally in a limited spatial resolution. In order to decrease the noise level and to increase the imaging resolution, Compton cameras have been proposed as an alternative to mechanical collimators. Image reconstruction in SPECT with Compton cameras yields to the problem of recovering a marker distribution from integrals over conical surfaces. Due to this and other applications, such conical Radon transforms recently got significant attention. In the current paper we consider the case where the cones of integration have vertices on a circular cylinder and axis pointing to the symmetry axis of the cylinder. As main results we derive analytic reconstruction methods for the considered transform. We also investigate the V-line transform with vertices on a <b>circle</b> and <b>symmetry</b> axis orthogonal to the circle, which arises in the special case where the absorber distribution is located in a horizontal plane.

Interestingly, the model contains a new heavy neutral lepton which may be a dark matter candidate. Two Higgs doublets are present in our construction, so that two CP even scalars are present in the model particle spectrum. One of them is similar to the Standard Model Higgs boson, while the other one couples mainly with the new exotic fermions. We performed a discovery analysis showing that the 5 TeV LHC can find the Y quark from single and pair production with masses from 300 GeV up to similar to 750 GeV. We also show that the new spectrum does not contribute significantly to the oblique EW parameters, and that dangerous flavor changing neutral currents are suppressed.
