50|$|Despite the {{multiplicity}} of definitions for crowdsourcing, one constant has been the broadcasting of problems to the public, and an open <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>contributions</b> to help solve the problem. Members of the public submit solutions that are then owned by the entity, which originally broadcast the problem. In some cases, the contributor of the solution is compensated monetarily with prizes or with recognition. In other cases, the only rewards may be a kudos or intellectual satisfaction. Crowdsourcing may produce solutions from amateurs or volunteers working in their spare time or from experts or small businesses, which were previously unknown to the initiating organization.|$|E

[...] The Seattle Times review predicted that Half the Sky may [...] "ignite a grass-roots revolution like the one that eliminated slavery." [...] In CounterPunch, Charles R. Larson declared: [...] "Half the Sky is the most important book that I have read since Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, published in 1962.

50|$|Financing of this {{proposal}} <b>called</b> <b>for</b> <b>contributions</b> from local governments—a first in France {{for construction of}} a high-speed line—and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. This was a favorable financial arrangement for SNCF due to low ridership projections and because {{the population of the}} towns served were below a threshold for building a high-speed line. The complexity of financing resulted in the long delay of the project. Under the government of Pierre Beregovoy (French Prime Minister from 1992-1993), the government refused to contribute more than 25 billion francs to the project, and limited the route to Baudrecourt, to which the Alsace region threatened to withdraw its financial contribution to the project. After long delays under the successive governments, all wanting to limit the cost of the project, a two-phase project was finally accepted by all parties, provided that commitments were made for the quick completion of the second phase.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the need and}} the {{opportunity}} for establishing a discipline for engineering secure Future Internet Services, typically based on research {{in the areas of}} software engineering, of service engineering and security engineering. Generic solutions that ignore the characteristics of Future Internet services will fail, yet it seems obvious to build on best practices and results that have emerged from various research communities. The paper sketches various lines of research and strands within each line to illustrate the needs and to sketch a community wide research plan. It will be essential to integrate various activities {{that need to be addressed}} in the scope of secure service engineering into comprehensive software and service life cycle support. Such a life cycle support must deliver assurance to the stakeholders and enable risk and cost management for the business stakeholders in particular.
