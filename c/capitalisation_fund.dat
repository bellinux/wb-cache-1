40|$|This paper {{looks at}} some of the {{fundamental}} ideas in contemporary economics such as the basic economic problem, opportunity cost and allocation a person is expected to encounter when they are first introduced to economic theory. It attempts to explain how the manner in which these concepts are interpreted and disseminated in mainstream economics may be counter productive to the capacity of economics to develop new ways of countering scarcity. It aligns these concepts with recent unrest in Europe caused by austerity measures. The paper looks at the capacity for contemporary economics to emerge from a cocoon spun from cobwebs of antiquated thought and inhibitions in order for it find extraordinary solutions for the extraordinary economic challenges the world faces today. Accelerated economic growth in an EOS model is applied to the economy of a developed country to illustrate the faster pace at which the model can transform stock markets and economic conditions as well as an illustration of how the current model may not exploit the full potential for market capitalisation businesses could have. In addition to this the paper addresses the ability of workers to take control of their finances through a concept concerning the capitalisation of their labour. A labour <b>capitalisation</b> <b>fund</b> allows employees to have their projected lifetime earnings paid up front and invested for the duration of their working life. It improves the relationship between capital and labour, frees up financial resources for governments and creates a new lucrative financial product for banks and other institutions in the financial services industry. ...|$|E
40|$|CeRM {{recommendation}} {{for creating a}} new tool, the Open Welfare Funds: open funds based on real capitalisation of contributions, dedicated to both pension and health care provisions, and linked to collective insurance coverage against major health risks (first of all lack of self-sufficiency) Within welfare systems, health care is the expenditure that poses the most urgent problems for long term sustainability. Without policy interventions and structural reforms, its physiological tendency towards increases over Gdp will inevitably require access restrictions and cutting off of demand for services. This paper highlights the need to renew the current health care financing scheme. In the presence of ageing populations and rising incidences of health care expenditures over Gdp, this scheme cannot remain fully {{in charge of the}} working income of active people (pay-as-you-go), if we want to avoid depressive effects on employment, investments and productivity. Such effects, besides hampering economic growth, would {{have a negative impact on}} health care itself, with resources becoming more and more scarce with respect to needs. The financing scheme must become multipillar, with pay-as-you-go complemented by a private channel based on the real capitalisation of contributions. This channel would be capable of allocating savings, supporting productive investments and generating resources to be dedicated to health care. The best structuring and concrete functioning of the private pillar is less clear and under discussion. This position paper puts forward an operational proposal: the open <b>capitalisation</b> <b>fund</b> for welfare should offer both pension and health care provisions through real accumulation of contributions on individual accounts, and should be linked to collective insurance coverage against major risks and lack of self-sufficiency. This tool presents numerous positive characteristics, compared to the public pay-as-you-go monopillar as well as to a multipillar system in which the private component consists exclusively or mainly of insurance contracts. In fact, it is necessary to restrict the recourse to pure insurance coverage only to a limited group of treatments, because this kind of coverage is not equipped to deal with the dynamics of future expenses. As the difficulties American insurance companies are experiencing demonstrate, the pure insurance coverage ends up with the recurrence, in the private area, of the same defects as the pay-as-you-go in the public health care systems. Insurance pooling is not but a pay-as-you-go scheme applied over the group of insured members. ...|$|E

50|$|Building on {{the success}} of its 2013 “Public Status” Mutual Fund, Castlestone {{unveiled}} its Equity High Yield & Premium Income Fund in March 2014. Designed to generate sustained growth in the long term, the Fund offers investor benefits such as transparency, liquidity, and no leverage. The Fund invests in stocks with dividend yields ranging from 4% to 6%, particularly consumer staples with noteworthy defensive attributes. The Fund generates premium income by writing covered calls, which limits potential downside in the event of equity market decline. At the time of the announcement, the Castlestone Equity High Yield & Premium Income Fund included semi-monopolistic assets with relatively inelastic demand. Early portfolio stocks include HSBC, AstraZeneca, and Sydney Airport. The Fund connects investors with a variety of high dividend yield and premium income strategies, many of which were offered by stable, large <b>capitalisation</b> companies. The <b>Fund</b> also represented a substitute for long-only developed market equity funds.|$|R
