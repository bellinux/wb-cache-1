The Office of the Auditor General of Norway criticized the Western Norway Public Roads Administration in 2001 for a total cost overrun of NOK900 million in three projects, the Triangle Link, the Lærdal Tunnel and parts of National Road 555. The majority of the cost overruns were tied to the Triangle Link. As a consequence, Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm stated that future large road investments would have an external quality assurance before being presented to Parliament.|$|E

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} model {{considering}} fairness {{in the problem}} of crew scheduling for bus drivers (CSP-BD) using a hybrid ant-colony optimization (HACO) algorithm to solve it. The main contributions of this work are the following: (a) a valid approach for cases with a special cost structure and constraints considering the fairness of working time and idle time; (b) an improved algorithm incorporating Gamma heuristic function and selecting rules. The relationships of each cost are examined with ten bus lines collected from the Beijing Public Transport Holdings (Group) Co., Ltd., {{one of the largest}} bus transit companies in the world. It shows that unfair cost is indirectly related to <b>common</b> <b>cost,</b> fixed cost and extra cost and also the unfair <b>cost</b> approaches to <b>common</b> and fixed <b>cost</b> when its coefficient is twice of <b>common</b> <b>cost</b> coefficient. Furthermore, the longest time for the tested bus line with 1108 pieces, 74 blocks is less than 30 minutes. The results indicate that the HACO-based algorithm can be a feasible and efficient optimization technique for CSP-BD, especially with large scale problems...|$|R

50|$|However, as the {{percentages}} of indirect or overhead costs rose, this technique became increasingly inaccurate, because indirect costs were not caused equally by all products. For example, one product might take more time in one expensive machine than another product - but since the amount of direct labor and materials might be the same, additional cost {{for use of the}} machine is not being recognized when the same broad 'on-cost' percentage is added to all products. Consequently, when multiple products share <b>common</b> <b>costs,</b> there is a danger of one product subsidizing another.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, {{some economists}} {{have argued that}} because public {{enterprises}} may pursue objectives different than profit maximization, they might have more of an incentive than profit-maximizing firms to behave anticompetitively through policies such as predatory pricing, misstating costs, and creating barriers to entry.

50|$|Despite the {{benefits}} to being of a high rank in a hierarchal group, there are also costs which offset these benefits. The most <b>common</b> <b>costs</b> to high-ranking individuals are higher metabolic rates {{and higher levels of}} stress hormones. In great tits and pied flycatchers, high-ranking individuals experience higher resting metabolic rates and therefore need to consume more food in order to maintain fitness and activity levels compared to subordinates in their groups. The energetic costs of defending territory, mates, and other resources can be very consuming and cause high-ranking individuals, who spend more time in these activities, to lose body mass over long periods of dominance. Therefore, their physical condition decreases the longer they spend partaking in these high-energy activities, and they lose rank as a function of age.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{papers in the}} {{theoretical}} auction literature show that the release of information regarding the seller’s valuation of an item can cause bidders to bid more aggressively. This widely accepted result in auction theory remains largely untested in the empirical literature. Recent theoretical work has also shown that this effect can be more pronounced in auctions with larger <b>common</b> <b>cost</b> uncertainty. We {{examine the impact of}} a policy change by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation that led to the release of the state’s internal estimate of the costs to complete highway construction projects. We perform a differences-in-differences analysis comparing bidding in Texas, a state that had a uniform policy of revealing the same information all throughout the period of analysis, to bidding in Oklahoma. Our results show that, in comparison to Texas auctions, the average bid in Oklahoma fell after the change in engineers’ cost estimate (ECE) policy. This decline in bids was even larger for projects where the <b>common</b> uncertainty in <b>costs</b> is greater. Moreover, the within-auction standard deviation of bids fell after the change in ECE policy with the most significant decline observed again in projects with greater <b>common</b> <b>cost</b> uncertainty.
