25|$|Formaldehyde is {{a common}} {{precursor}} to more complex compounds and materials. In approximate order of decreasing consumption, products generated from formaldehyde include urea formaldehyde resin, melamine resin, phenol formaldehyde resin, polyoxymethylene plastics, 1,4-butanediol, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate. The textile industry uses formaldehyde-based resins as finishers to make fabrics <b>crease-resistant.</b> Formaldehyde-based materials are key to the manufacture of automobiles, and used to make components for the transmission, electrical system, engine block, door panels, axles and brake shoes. The value of sales of formaldehyde and derivative products was over $145 billion in 2003, about 1.2% {{of the gross domestic}} product (GDP) of the United States and Canada. Including indirect employment, over 4 million people work in the formaldehyde industry across approximately 11,900 plants in the U.S. and Canada.|$|E
50|$|Tootal is a {{brand name}} {{for a range of}} British ties, scarves and other garments. The brand is now owned by Coats Viyella. It {{originates}} from a textile spinning and manufacturing company established in Manchester in 1799, which later became Tootal Broadhurst Lee, and subsequently Tootal Ltd. The company held patents in <b>crease-resistant</b> fabric.|$|E
5000|$|THPC has {{industrial}} {{importance in}} the production of <b>crease-resistant</b> and flame-retardant finishes on cotton textiles and other cellulosic fabrics. [...] A flame-retardant finish can be prepared from THPC by the Proban Process, in which THPC is treated with urea. The urea condenses with the hydroxymethyl groups on THPC. The phosphonium structure is converted to phosphine oxide as the result of this reaction.|$|E
50|$|The {{materials}} used for both clothing and accessories changed during this era. Increasingly used were easy-care synthetic fabrics such as Crimplene, Dacron and Terylene. The benefits of such synthetic fabrics were {{that they were}} <b>crease-resistant,</b> easy to wash, and required little to no ironing. Designers such as Cristóbal Balenciaga embraced these new types of materials, using them in oversized dolman-sleeve jackets. The pattern for this piece was cut in a rectangular shape forming a boxy blousy look.|$|E
5000|$|Tootal, Broadhurst, Lee {{continued}} {{to develop in}} the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and in 1907 Edward Tootal Broadhurst, the son of Henry Tootal Broadhurst, succeeded Harold Lee (the son of Henry Lee) as chairman. The company was an innovator in its promotion of brand names, and in selling its goods direct to retailers. [...] Though early in its history it specialised in cotton fabrics, it later diversified into other yarns including silk and rayon. It developed a range of fabrics in a wide variety of patterns, including a velvet marketed as [...] "Tootal cloth", and [...] "Tarantulle", used for lingerie and baby wear, as well as focussing on products such as handkerchiefs, scarves and ties. The company provided neckerchiefs and other items for soldiers in the Boer War. A research department was established, and it was active in developing new innovations, such as <b>crease-resistant</b> fabrics. [...] In the early 1920s, it took out patents on urea-formaldehyde resins to produce <b>crease-resistant</b> fabrics, and commercialised its patents by developing an international licensing programme, with successful agencies being granted the use of the Tebilized registered trade mark.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} preparing a mugwort leaf oil microcapsule antibacterial <b>crease-resistant</b> fabric. The method comprises the following steps of: 1) emulsifying mugwort leaf oil in an emulsifying agent made of wall material; 2) performing complex coagulation reaction on the emulsified mugwort leaf oil; 3) cross-linking and curing the emulsion after the complex coagulation reaction to obtain mugwort leaf oil microcapsule emulsion; 4) adding <b>crease-resistant</b> cross linker, catalyst and penetrating agent into the obtained mugwort leaf oil microcapsule emulsion to prepare a mugwort leaf oil microcapsule antibacterial <b>crease-resistant</b> fabric finishing agent; and 5) treating the fabric by using the prepared mugwort leaf oil microcapsule antibacterial <b>crease-resistant</b> fabric finishing agent to obtain the mugwort leaf oil microcapsule antibacterial <b>crease-resistant</b> fabric. The invention also relates to the mugwort leaf oil microcapsule antibacterial <b>crease-resistant</b> fabric prepared by using the method. The mugwort leaf oil microcapsule antibacterial fabric has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory functions, meanwhile has <b>crease-resistant</b> and ironing-free functions, and hasgood washing fastness. 本发明涉及一种艾叶油微胶囊抗菌防皱织物的制备的方法，其包括： 1) 在以壁材形成的乳化剂中乳化艾叶油； 2) 使乳化的艾叶油发生复凝聚反应； 3) 交联并固化复凝聚反应后的乳液，以得到艾叶油微胶囊乳液； 4) 在得到的艾叶油微胶囊乳液中加入防皱交联剂、催化剂和渗透剂，以制成艾叶油微胶囊抗菌防皱织物整理剂； 5) 将织物用制成的艾叶油微胶囊抗菌防皱织物整理剂进行处理以得到艾叶油微胶囊抗菌防皱织物。本发明还涉及利用本发明的方法制成的艾叶油微胶囊抗菌防皱织物。本发明的艾叶油微胶囊抗菌织物具有抗菌消炎的功能，同时还具有防皱免烫功能，并有较好的耐洗性效果。Institute of Textiles and ClothingSchool of NursingInventor name used in this publication: 李鹂Inventor name used in this publication: 区伟文Inventor name used in this publication: 汪国成Inventor name used in this publication: 钟慧仪Inventor name used in this publication: 李毅Title in Traditional Chinese: 一種艾葉油微膠囊抗菌防皺織物及其製備方法Chin...|$|E
40|$|The <b>crease-resistant</b> {{processing}} of dress materials has greatly developed of late years {{and as a}} result of it, much publicity is given these days to what are called <b>crease-resistant</b> summer-wear materials. In order to ascertain to what extent the crease-resistance of such materials on sale has been increased, as compared with that of the unprocessed materials of the same kinds, the author made an experiment by employing as samples several of those materials now on the market. The experimental method was as follows. A fixed size of each material was obtained, kept in a state of constant humidity, folded into two and placed under a fixed load for a fixed length of time. The load was then lifted and after a fixed lapse of time, measurement as well as microscopy was performed from end to end of each sample. Some of the materials thus examined showed hoghly satisfactory results, while others did not. These materials were further washed and subsequent to it, the same experimental method as above was taken for any possible alteration of reasults that might occur...|$|E
40|$|N-Methylol {{reagents}} are conventional crosslinking {{agents that}} are still widely used in textile industry to produce <b>crease-resistant</b> cotton fabrics. In this work serine proteases were used to recover the strength of fabrics, crosslinked with N-hydroxymethylacrylamide. Nearly {{one half of the}} strength loss of rosslinked cotton fabrics could be restored after protease treatment, while the wrinkle recovery angle (WRA) decreased only slightly. The enzymatic hydrolysis of the amide cross-links in the durable pressed cellulose was confirmed by FT-IR analysis and dyeability with an acid dye. Effect of protease concentration on the tensile strength recovery, WRAand acid dye dyeability at 30 min reaction time...|$|E
40|$|Improved {{hygiene and}} health care {{standards}} have {{a great impact on}} the development of hygiene {{and health care}} products. For this purpose, viscose is a very popular substrate. One of the most promising anti-microbial compounds of modern times is chitosan. The anti-microbial action of this polysaccharide depends on the amino group amount, which is crucial for ensuring the effectiveness of anti-microbial treated material. In textile finishing, 1, 2, 3, 4 -buthanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) is usually used as a non-formaldehyde <b>crease-resistant</b> reagent. But, on the other hand, the negatively charged carboxyl groups of BTCA can be explored as additional binding sites for positively-charged protonated amino groups of chitosan. When using microwaves, polar materials (e. g. chitosan) orient and reorient themselves according to the direction of the electro-magnetic field, which means that chitosan chain-bending may have taken place during the drying with microwaves. This could result in a higher specific surface of the chitosan and, consequently, in a higher proportion of available amino groups. It is concluded that the combination chitosan/BTCA supported by microwaves drying represents an ideal combination to increase the proportion of available amino groups...|$|E
