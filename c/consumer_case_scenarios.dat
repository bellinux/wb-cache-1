40|$|Use <b>case</b> <b>scenario</b> {{has been}} {{commonly}} used for single products. However, when used for software product lines, it raises new issues to consider. In software product lines, products share common features and additionally {{have their own}} unique sets of features where the latter can be represented by so called variability model. When various combinations of variants are selected, they should be selected such that they obey the constraints imposed by variability model. Therefore, the use cases developed for a product line cannot be used straightforwardly for products. In this paper, we provide a systematic way to mapping the constraints in a variability model called OVM to use <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> using the notion of tagged use <b>case</b> <b>scenario.</b> We also present an algorithm for automatically generating product use <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> based on OVM model and tagged use <b>case</b> <b>scenarios...</b>|$|R

Motivated by mission critical applications, we present an approach to systematically analyze and test the performance of wireless ad-hoc routing protocols under worst <b>case</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Because of some important energy-stringent applications, we targeted the network partition problem that results from some nodes being depleted of power. The corresponding worst <b>case</b> <b>scenario</b> {{is the one that}} causes network partition with the least host trac. We obtained the worst <b>case</b> <b>scenario</b> using heuristic search techniques combined with an extended nite state machine (FSM) model to represent the wireless routing protocol. Simulation showed that much less trac is required to bisect the network for our " <b>case</b> <b>scenario</b> than for any one {{of a large number of}} random scenarios. Furthermore, the simulation result under the " <b>case</b> <b>scenario</b> was similar [...] ...|$|R
40|$|As it is {{possible}} for students of education universities who can enter into actual teaching practice from an early stage in their training, it may seem that {{there is no need to}} use the <b>case</b> <b>scenario.</b> In recent years, however, many serious problems have arisen with newly appointed teachers, as the actual school experience is too difficult for them to handle. They must therefore be trained through virtual experiences, using interactive cenarios. There in lies the necessity for increased virtual training. When creating an interactive <b>case</b> <b>scenario</b> of a problem that may occur in the educational field, it becomes especially difficult to assume a clear objective and to imagine the processes leading to the problem's resolution. It is required that we should follow up a clue to solve the problem viewing from various angles. In response to this problem, we propose an interactive <b>case</b> <b>scenario,</b> in lieu of a conventional <b>case</b> <b>scenario.</b> When using the interactive <b>case</b> <b>scenario,</b> learners can approach the essence of the event (where the problem is) through dialog with others. In such case, it is very important to display guiding questions, so as to clarify the functions and structures. We therefore elaborated an interactive <b>case</b> <b>scenario</b> and tried it many times. We here report the analytical results of those endeavors...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} {{potential}} impact of demand management strategies on patient decision-making in medically non-urgent and urgent scenarios during out-of-hours for {{children between the ages of}} 0 and 4 years. DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with paper-based <b>case</b> <b>scenarios.</b> A survey was sent to all 797 parents of children aged between 0 and 4 years from four Dutch general practitioner (GP) practices. Four demand management strategies (copayment, online advice, overview medical cost and GP appointment next morning) were incorporated in two medically non-urgent and two urgent <b>case</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Combining the <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> with the demand management strategies resulted in 16 <b>cases</b> (four <b>scenarios</b> each with four demand management strategies). Each parent randomly received a questionnaire with three different <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> with three different demand strategies and a baseline <b>case</b> <b>scenario</b> without a demand management strategy. RESULTS: The response rate was 47. 4 %. The strategy online advice led to more medically appropriate decision-making for both non-urgent <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> (OR 0. 26; CI 0. 11 to 0. 58) and urgent <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> (OR 0. 16; CI 0. 08 to 0. 32). Overview of medical cost (OR 0. 59; CI 0. 38 to 0. 92) and a GP appointment planned the next morning (OR 0. 57; CI 0. 34 to 0. 97) had some influence on patient decisions for urgent cases, but not for non-urgent cases. Copayment had no influence on patient decisions. CONCLUSION: Online advice has the highest potential to reduce medically unnecessary use. Furthermore it enhanced safety of parents' decisions on seeking help for their young children during out-of-hours primary care. Valid online information on health symptoms for patients should be promoted...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A 'case scenario' {{study on}} {{clinical}} decisions in progressing Parkinson's disease (PD) {{was developed to}} complement scientific evidence with the collective judgment of a panel of experts. METHODS: The opinions of 9 experts in movement disorders on the appropriateness of 9 common pharmacological treatments for 33 hypothetical patient profiles were compared to those of 14 general neurologists. Before rating the <b>case</b> <b>scenarios,</b> all participants received a document integrating European and US guidelines {{for the treatment of}} patients with advanced PD. <b>Case</b> <b>scenarios</b> showing disagreement or with inconsistencies in appropriateness ratings were discussed at a feedback meeting. A tool for interactive discussion on the clinical <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> included was developed based on the outcome of the study. RESULTS: Current guidelines are often insufficient to adequately guide the management of patients with progressing PD. The <b>case</b> <b>scenario</b> study did not reveal major differences in opinions between experts in movement disorders and general neurologists about the appropriateness of certain drug choices for specific <b>case</b> <b>scenarios.</b> However in about 1 out of 5 treatment decisions where experts stated appropriateness or inappropriateness, the general neurologists panel had no or dispersed opinions. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals more uncertainty about treatment of advanced PD in general neurologists compared with experts in movement disorders and underlines the need for additional support for guiding treatment decisions in clinical practice.

40|$|Expert {{decision}} makers in bushfire settings regularly perform well under complex and hazardous conditions, particularly when situations develop in predictable patterns (Klein, 1998). However, {{decision makers}} in such settings must also contend with extreme events: worst <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> that become reality. Worst cases are low-probability, high-consequence events, {{which must be}} examined to ensure safe decision making. Although disaster prevention and mitigation are critical aspects of decision making in bushfire fighting, little systematic research {{has been carried out}} concerning the impact of worst <b>case</b> <b>scenarios,</b> both in intuitive and deliberative decision making. The consideration of worst <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> may be particularly difficult for decision makers dealing with the challenges encountered in naturalistic settings. The Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM) tradition rests on the contention that expertise, developed through considerable experience, is essential to effective decision making (Zsambok & Klein, 1997). This poses a problem for anticipating rare extreme events in real-world environments; more experience may bring with it a lower capacity to identify major unexpected catastrophes. The research reported here investigated worst <b>case</b> <b>scenario</b> reporting by bushfire fighters. Post...|$|R
40|$|The ICT for Development (ICTD) {{research}} field still lacks {{a generic}} architecture approach unifying software development tasks in ICTD research.
