Homoerotic elements in literature were pervasive, specifically the masquerade of one gender for another to fool an unsuspecting woman into being seduced. Such plot devices were used in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (1601), The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser in 1590, and James Shirley's The Bird in a Cage (1633). Extraordinary cases during the Renaissance of women taking on male personae and going undetected for years or decades have been recorded.|$|E

By 1985 this was <b>common</b> <b>knowledge</b> among church members as the 93-year-old preacher had not been seen in public for several months. According to The Worldwide News, the official church newsletter, Armstrong told his advisory council on January 7, 1986, of his decision to appoint Tkach to succeed him {{in the event of}} his death.

Bajrangi and Suresh Richard said that Narendra Modi visited Naroda Patiya a day after the massacre to thank them, but the official record shows that Modi did not visit Naroda Patiya.

40|$|A long-standing {{dream of}} {{artificial}} intelligence {{has been to}} put <b>common</b> sense <b>knowledge</b> into computers—enabling machines to reason about everyday life.

5|$|The Marian {{government}} {{produced a}} pamphlet with all six recantations plus {{the text of}} the speech Cranmer was to have made in the University Church. His subsequent withdrawal of his recantations was not mentioned, though what actually happened soon became <b>common</b> <b>knowledge,</b> undermining the effectiveness of Marian propaganda. Similarly, the Protestant party had difficulty in making use of the event, given Cranmer's recantations. The exiles' propaganda concentrated on publishing various specimens of his writings. Eventually John Foxe put Cranmer's story to effective use in 1559, and it features prominently in his Acts and Monuments when it was first printed in 1563.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, {{a section}} funded by MI6 {{was created for}} propaganda, headed by Sir Campbell Stuart. It was {{allocated}} premises at Electra House and was dubbed Department EH. On 25 September 1939 the unit was mobilised to Woburn Abbey where it joined a subversion team from MI6, known as Section D, and by July these teams {{became a part of}} the newly created Special Operations Executive (SOE). These SOE elements went on to form the core of the Political Warfare Executive in 1941. Their task was to spread false rumours and conduct psychological warfare. Inspired by a demonstration of petroleum warfare, one false rumour stated that the British had a new bomb: dropped from an aircraft, it caused a thin film of volatile liquid to spread over {{the surface of the water}} which it then ignited. Such rumours were credible and rapidly spread. American broadcaster William Shirer recorded large numbers of burns victims in Berlin; though it is not clear what he personally saw, it seems likely his reports were influenced by rumours. The interrogation of a Luftwaffe pilot revealed the existence of such weapons was <b>common</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and documents found after the war showed the German high command were deceived. The rumour seemed to take on a life of its own on both sides leading to persistent stories of a thwarted German invasion, in spite of official British denials. On 15 December 1940, The New York Times ran a story claiming that tens of thousands of German troops had been 'consumed by fire' in two failed invasion attempts.|$|E

40|$|Compared {{to human}} intelligence, {{computers}} are {{far short of}} <b>common</b> sense <b>knowledge</b> which people normally acquire during the formative years of their lives. This paper investigates the effects of employing <b>common</b> sense <b>knowledge</b> as a new linguistic context in handwritten Chinese text recognition. Three methods are introduced to supplement the standard n-gram language model: embedding model, direct model, and an ensemble of these two. The embedding model uses semantic similarities from <b>common</b> sense <b>knowledge</b> to make the n-gram probabilities estimation more reliable, especially for the unseen n-grams in the training text corpus. The direct model, in turn, considers the linguistic context of the whole document {{to make up for}} the short context limit of the n-gram model. The three models are evaluated on a large unconstrained handwriting database, CASIA-HWDB, and the results show that the adoption of <b>common</b> sense <b>knowledge</b> yields improvements in recognition performance, despite the reduced concept list hereby employed...|$|R

It is the subject of enormous recent interest and enthusiasm with respect to policymaking about innovation, creative production, and intellectual property. Taking that enthusiasm as its starting point, Governing <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Commons</b> argues that policymaking should be based on evidence and a deeper understanding of what makes commons institutions work. It offers a systematic way to study <b>knowledge</b> <b>commons,</b> borrowing and building on Elinor Ostrom 2 ̆ 7 s Nobel Prize-winning research on natural resource commons. It proposes a framework for studying <b>knowledge</b> <b>commons</b> that is adapted to the unique attributes of knowledge and information, describing the framework in detail and explaining how to put it into context both with respect to commons research and with respect to innovation and information policy.
