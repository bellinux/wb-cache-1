40|$|Carex lepidocarpa {{grows in}} {{isolated}} and scattered areas throughout the country, wherever suitable localities occur. It shows considerable variation {{in form and}} size over its range, but this can usually be correlated with its different habitats, and its regional adaptation to climate and topography. In fact this species seems to form a discontinuous topocline in the British Isles (Huxley, 1939) and the <b>character</b> <b>gradient</b> {{in this case is}} clearly associated with latitude and altitude. Thus the southern lowland and Scottish mountain plants represent the extreme forms. The former, confined to the fens and calcareous marshes in southern England, {{is very different from the}} latter, a plant of base-rich flushes on high mountains, and these forms remain distinct even in cultiva-tion. However, as some populations in the Midlands and northern England (the carboni-ferous limestone of the Pennines, in Derbyshire, Yorkshire, Durham and Westmorland) show intermediate characters and are difficult to classify, it seems best to regard these extreme forms as subspecies. A short description of the species and the two subspecies found in the British Isles now follows...|$|E
40|$|A {{morphological}} {{study was}} made of a population of Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) rondoni (Neiva and Pinto) from northern Mato Grosso, Brazil. This population usually lacked the primary key character of a dark basal band on hindtarsomere 3, i. e., hindtarsomere 3 was all white as in most {{other members of the}} subgenus. It was determined that this species can be recognized instead by the presence of a dark spot on the thorax made up of a large dark prescutellar space that is contiguous with a concolorous central area on the scutellum. A secondary character of a dark area on the costa created by the fusion of the humeral dark, presector dark and sector dark proximal spots is also usually reliable. Regression analyses comparing the lengths and ratios of the dark bands on hindtarsomeres 2 to those on 3 describe a straight line relationship. This suggests that the "atypical" population is at one end of a <b>character</b> <b>gradient.</b> We propose that in the subgenus Nyssorhynchus individuals that have a long basal band on hindtarsomere 2 are more likely to also have a basal band on hindtarsomere 3. The pupal stage of this species has not been previously described. Reared-associated specimens from this study show that the pupa can be easily differentiated from all other Nyssorhynchus by the relatively stout, usually 2 or 3 branched (1 - 5), setae 1 and 5 on segments IV-VII...|$|E
40|$|The {{subspecies}} of Erebia euryale (Esper, 1805) {{have been}} split into three groups based on morphology, differing in male genital characters. Two of them, the euryale group and the adyte group, {{are known to be}} strongly, but not completely, reproductively isolated. There is genetic evidence that their separation preceded the differentiation of subspecies within the euryale group. No such data exist on the third group, the recently recognized kunzi group. In this study, the degree of reproductive isolation between the kunzi group and the other two groups is assessed. In three secondary contact zones, a series of E. euryale populations were sampled in a transect perpendicular to the dividing line. Morphological characteristics showed a clinal gradient along each transect. The steepest gradient was found between the euryale and kunzi groups. Morphologically detectable introgression did not exceed two kilometres. This is comparable to the situation described earlier in contact zones of the euryale and adyte groups. In the contact area of the kunzi and adyte groups, the <b>character</b> <b>gradient</b> slope is more gradual and the morphologically detectable introgression zone is at least five times wider. In contrast to this, contact between subspecies belonging to the same group leads to virtually unrestricted morphological intermingling. It is concluded that the euryale group is reproductively more strongly isolated from the other two groups than the kunzi group is from the adyte group, and that subspecies belonging to the same group are interfertile to a high degree. It is argued that loss of genetic compatibility by long term separation is the main cause of the reproductive isolation between groups, and that, consequently, the actual intraspecific structure of E. euryale results from at least two, probably three, temporally separated differentiation events...|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since it}} became {{apparent}} that terrestrial animals ranging over large continental areas generally showed a certain degree of gradual geographic variation, attention has been focused on the colour variation of the Jay, Garrulus glandarius, in Europe. Surely the Jays belong to those species of palearctic land birds in which the formation of geographical differences must be considered to be exceptionally favoured: HARTERT (1903 — 1922; including HARTERT & STEINBACHER 1932) recognized as many as 10 European races of the Jay by name, whereas Kleiner (1935 — 38) in his monographic treatment of the species numbered as many as 9 races in the same region. In several instances of the geographic variation of the Jay the differences are exceedingly striking, e. g. between the reddish brown Jays from Ireland and the dark grey ones from northern and central Europe. Still, the intergradations are so gradual and the individual variation is so unexpectedly large, that the application of subspecific names as a method of expressing geographical variation has proved to meet with serious difficulties. The resulting confusion of names for years has stressed geographical differences being of only minor importance and has obscured others meriting a closer attention. However, it was not at all for nomenclatorial purposes that this study was started, nor in order to propose a new arrangement of the geographic races of the Jay in Europa. That, in spite of this, these topics have been dealt with in one of the following chapters of this paper must be explained {{from the fact that the}} author failed to see a possibility to avoid them. The main purpose of this study was to investigate instances of “clinal variation”, meaning the presence and the origin of geographical <b>character</b> <b>gradients.</b> “Character gradients in the frequencies or in the expression of variable characters” (DOBZHANSKY 1947, p. 67) occurring in continuous geographical areas have seriously attracted the attention of students of population genetics and of micro-evolution. Hence it seemed worth while to select a suitable subject for a comparison of local individual variation with geographical variation and to study the origin of the clines. This is what the author has tried to do in the course of the present study on Garrulus glandarius...|$|R

The Ti(C,N) gradient coating was investigated by XPS method with multifunctional PHI 5700 / 660 spectrometer. The characteristic of surface region coating were determined from XPS depth profile. X-ray qualitative phase analysis and the grazing incidence X-ray diffraction method (GIXRD) was employed to collect the detailed information about phase composition of investigated material’s surface layer.

Coatings are characterized by dense, compact structure, there have been identified no pores, fractures and discontinuities. The coatings were deposited uniformly onto the investigated substrate materials and show a characteristic columnar, fine-graded structure. The results of roughness, microhardness and cutting tests confirm {{the advantages of the}} PVD coatings.

Inmould technique was used to produce TWDI. It has been estimated castability and metallographic investigations were made using different moulding materials. From castability measurements result that it is possible to obtain thin wall ductile iron castings with wall thickness down to 1 mm with castability of 200 mm. Using mould with small ability to absorb heat castability increases twice. At wall thickness equal 3 mm castability reaches 1000 mm and using LDASC sand its value increases to over 1500 mm.

In the logographic Chinese language system, similar functional and spatial hierarchical presentations of brain responses to sublexical orthographic structure are beginning to be explored. In this study, we used whole-brain fMRI {{to show that a}} hierarchical coding of increasingly language-like character type is present in multiple Chinese language processing areas. Fluent Chinese readers were presented with Chinese synonyms/non-synonym pairs, identical/non-identical non-pronounceable pseudo-character pairs constructed with Chinese radicals, and identical/non-identical Korean character pairs. We observed the presence of a spatial gradient for increasing language-like character types in the ventral and dorsal visual streams of the cortex. At the left occipitotemporal cortex of the ventral visual stream, we observed a posterior-to-anterior <b>gradient</b> of <b>character</b> type selectivity with the anterior fusiform region being more selective for real Chinese characters and the posterior fusiform region being more selective for Korean characters. At the left and right intraparietal sulci of the dorsal visual stream, a medial-to-lateral <b>gradient</b> of <b>character</b> type selectivity was observed, with the lateral edge being more selective for real Chinese characters, the medial edge being more selective for pseudo-characters, and with less activation attributable to Korean <b>characters.</b> Spatial <b>gradients</b> of selecting <b>character</b> type were also identified in prefrontal cortex, dorsal striatum and lateral temporal cortex.

The <b>gradient</b> <b>character</b> of changing of structure-phase states and dislocation substructure along the cross section of rail head is revealed. The oil bulk hardening of superior quality rails is accompanied by the formation of morphologically different structure, being produced according to the shear and diffusion of γ-α transformation.

The interfacial zone is treated as a nonhomogeneous interlayer having spatially varying thermoelastic moduli between dissimilar, homogeneous half-planes. The crack is assumed to exist {{in one of the}} half-planes at an arbitrary angle to the graded interfacial zone, disturbing uniform steady-state heat flows. The Fourier integral transform method is employed in conjunction with the coordinate transformations of field variables in the basic thermoelasticity equations. Formulation of the current nonisothermal crack problem lends itself to the derivation of two sets of Cauchy-type singular integral equations for heat conduction and thermal stress analyses. The heat-flux intensity factors and the thermal-stress intensity factors are defined and evaluated in order to quantify the singular <b>characters</b> of temperature <b>gradients</b> and thermal stresses, respectively, in the near-tip region. Numerical results include the variations of such crack-tip field intensity factors versus the crack orientation angle for various combinations of material and geometric parameters of the dissimilar media bonded through the thermoelastically graded interfacial zone.

40|$|ABSTRACT m Gradient {{corrections}} to {{the local}} spin density (LSD) approximation for the exchange-correlation energy are making density functional theory as useful in quantum chemistry {{as it is in}} solid-state physics. But which of the many gradient-corrected density functionals should be preferred a priori? We make a graphical comparison of the gradient dependencies of some popular approximations, discussing the exact formal conditions which each obeys and identifying which conditions seem most important. For the exchange energy, there is little formal or practical reason to choose among the Perdew-Wang 86, Becke 88, or Perdew-Wang 91 functionals. But, for the correlation energy, the best formal properties are displayed by the nonempirical rw 91 correlation functional. Furthermore, the real-space foundation of rw 91 yields an insight into the <b>character</b> of the <b>gradient</b> expansion which suggests that rw 91 should work especially well for solids. Indeed, while improving dissociation energies over LSD, rw 91 remains the most "local " of the gradient-corrected exchange-correlation functionals and, thus, the least likely to overcorrect the subtle errors of LSD for solids. To show that our analysis of spin-unpolarized functionals is sufficient, we also compute spin-polarization energies for atoms, finding ~ w 9 1 values only slightly more negative than SD values...|$|R
40|$|Auxin efflux carrier PIN {{proteins}} {{have been}} intensively investigated {{as they are}} the first polar cargos to be identified in plants with a direct relevance for plant patterning. Based on their polar localization; PIN proteins direct the intercellular flow of signaling molecule auxin and thus bear a rate limiting effect on the formation of auxin activity gradients. With this influence on directionality and extent of auxin transport PINs play crucial roles in plant body organization. Many factors such as vesicle trafficking regulator ARF-GEF GNOM, a kinase PINOID, a retromer complex and membrane sterol composition influence polar PIN localization. Recent work uncovers the mechanism that generates default PIN polarity. Real time PIN tracking reveals that PIN polarity is generated from initially non-polar secretion via endocytosis and subsequent polar recycling. In addition, the Rab 5 endocytic pathway emerges to be important for polar PIN localization as Rab 5 interference causes non-polar distribution of PINs. This non-polar distribution of PINs during embryogenesis transiently alters auxin activity gradients and changes organ identity by transforming embryonic leaf cells to root fates. These findings for the first time link PIN polarity-based auxin activity gradient to cell fate decisions and thus demonstrate morphogen (a substance influencing cell fates on its concentration <b>gradient)</b> <b>characters</b> of auxin. They also suggest an auxin activity distribution-dependent sensing module that executes differential apical and basal developmental program during plant embryogenesis...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{recently}} developed Higher Order Microplane (HOM) model for softening and localization, is implemented within a isogeometric finite element framework. The HOM model was derived {{directly from a}} three dimensional discrete particle model and it was shown {{to be associated with}} a high order continuum characterized by independent rotation and displacement fields. Furthermore, the HOM model possesses two characteristic lengths: the first associated with the spacing of flaws in the material internal structure and related to the <b>gradient</b> <b>character</b> of the continuum; and the second associated with the size of these flaws and related to the micro-polar character of the continuum. The displacement-based finite element implementation of this type of continua requires $C^ 1 $ continuity both within the elements and at the element boundaries. This motivated the implementation of the concept of isogeometric analysis which ensures a higher degree of smoothness and continuity. NURBS based isogeometric elements were implemented in a 3 D setting, with both displacement and rotational degrees of freedom at each control point. The performed numerical analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HOM model implementation to ensure optimal convergence in both elastic and softening regime. Furthermore, the proposed approach allows the natural formulation of a localization limiter able to prevent strain localization and spurious mesh sensitivity known to be pathological issues for typical local strain-softening constitutive equations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Formal syntax has {{hitherto}} worked {{mostly with}} theoretical frameworks that take grammars to be generative, in Emil Post’s sense: they provide recursive enumerations of sets. This work has {{its origins in}} Post’s formalization of proof theory. There is an alternative, with roots in the semantic side of logic: model-theoretic syntax (MTS). MTS takes grammars to be sets of statements of which (algebraically idealized) well-formed expressions are models. We clarify {{the difference between the}} two kinds of framework and review their separate histories, and then argue that the generative perspective has misled linguists concerning the properties of natural languages. We select two elementary facts about natural language phenomena for discussion: the <b>gradient</b> <b>character</b> of the property of being ungrammatical and the open nature of natural language lexicons. We claim that the MTS perspective on syntactic structure does much better on representing the facts in these two domains. We also examine the arguments linguists give for the infinitude of the class of all expressions in a natural language. These arguments turn out on examination to be either unsound or lacking in empirical content. We claim that infinitude is an unsupportable claim that is also unimportant. What is actually needed is a way of representing the structure of expressions in a natural language without assigning any importance to the notion of a unique set with definite cardinality that contains all and only the expressions in the language.

The films present a porous and inhomogeneous microstructure in which the porosity and thus the refractive index vary inside the film. The film effective refractive index is found to decrease from 1. 33 near the substrate to 1. 16 at the film surface.

The definition of species boundaries in this genus {{has been the subject}} of few studies, in spite of the presence of ambiguous taxonomic distinction, and a revision of the genus has never been undertaken. The multivariate analyses of both descriptive and morphometric characters confirmed the distinction of P. digitata and P. contigua, conversely P. haimeana, P. profundacella and their intermediate morph differentiated on the basis of descriptive morphologic characters only. Morphometric characters alone allowed a less defined distinction between morphs, and morphological boundaries essentially intergraded in a gradient driven by enclosed corallite series characters. The phylogenetic analysis of a portion of the rDNA confirmed the morphological inferences, as P. digitata appears to be a distinct evolutionary lineage. Conversely, the other four morphs, P. contigua, P. haimeana, P. profundacella and their intermediate constitute a polytomic gene pool significantly distinct from P. digitata. Yet, P. contigua is significantly distinct from the other three morphs. Both morphological and molecular approaches suggested that P. haimeana, P. profundacella and their intermediate cannot be considered clearly distinct entities. Hybridization with other species of this genus not included in this study, or recent origin may have contributed to the polyphyly and lack of phylogenetic resolution of P. haimeana, P. profundacella and their intermediate morph.

40|$|Insight into plasma microturbulence and {{transport}} is being sought using linear simulations of drift waves on the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX), following {{a study of}} drift wave modes on the Alcator C-Mod Tokamak. Microturbulence is likely generated by instabilities of drift waves, which cause transport of heat and particles. Understanding this transport is important because the containment of heat and particles {{is required for the}} achievement of practical nuclear fusion. Microtearing modes may cause high heat transport through high electron thermal conductivity. It is hoped that microtearing will be stable along with good electron transport in the proposed low collisionality International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). Stability of the microtearing mode is investigated for conditions at mid-radius in a high density NSTX high performance (H-mode) plasma, which is compared to the proposed ITER plasmas. The microtearing mode is driven by the electron temperature gradient, and believed to be mediated by ion collisions and magnetic shear. Calculations are based on input files produced by TRXPL following TRANSP (a time-dependent transport analysis code) analysis. The variability of unstable mode growth rates is examined as a function of ion and electron collisionalities using the parallel gyrokinetic computational code GS 2. Results show the microtearing mode stability dependence for a range of plasma collisionalities. Computation verifies analytic predictions that higher collisionalities than in the NSTX experiment increase microtearing instability growth rates, but that the modes are stabilized at the highest values. There is a transition of the dominant mode in the collisionality scan to ion temperature <b>gradient</b> <b>character</b> at both high and low collisionalities.

The presence of remnant old trees apparently increased the occurrence of old-growth associates in young stands. The calicioids, a group of microlichens investigated only in the Cascades, had a strong association with old growth forest and remnant trees. Diversity of calicioids may also be increased by legacy structures such as old snags and wolf trees. These structures increase continuity between current and previous stands. Macrolichen communities varied between the Coast and Cascade Mountain Ranges, following climatic gradients, particularly annual precipitation. Successional patterns in macrolichen communities appeared to differ between the mountain ranges. The modeling method proposed for using habitat associations to predict occurrence has several advantages over common modeling methods, such as regression. The method is simple, avoids parametric assumptions, provides easy updating of models as additional sites are sampled, and automatically accounts for interactions among predictor variables. It can be linked with GIS data and software to map estimated probability of occurrence across landscapes. The data on calicioids from the Cascades, supplemented with additional stand inventories, were used to test and demonstrate the modeling method...|$|R
40|$|The Baltic Sea is {{an ideal}} natural {{laboratory}} to study the methane cycle {{in the framework of}} diagenetic processes. With its brackish <b>character</b> and a <b>gradient</b> from nearly marine to almost limnic conditions, a strong permanent haline stratification leading to large vertical redox gradients in the water column, and a sedimentation history which resulted in the deposition of organic-rich young post-glacial sediments over older glacial and post-glacial strata with very low organic content, the Baltic allows to study the role of a variety of key parameters for early diagenetic processes including the methane cycle. Within the BONUS + Project “Baltic Gas”, a 3. 5 week scientific expedition of RV Maria S. Merian in August 2010 was dedicated to study the methane cycle in the various basins of the Baltic Sea, with strong emphasis on the metabolic reactions of early diagenesis and the occurrence of shallow gas deposits. Various subbottom profiling systems were used to map the thickness and structure of organic-rich deposits and build the base for a detailed coring program for biogeochemical analysis, including methane, sulfur compounds, iron, and other compounds. Methane gradients in connection with the information of the areal extend of organic-rich deposits are used to estimate the diffusive flux from the sediments into the water column and the rate of methane oxidation, with changing importance of sulfate as oxidant along the salinity gradient. On selected key stations, rate measurements of methanogenic and methanotrophic reactions were executed. The methane distribution in the water column was comprehensively assessed, revealing amongst other findings a drastic increase in bottom water methane concentration between the post bloom summer situation and the situation in the winter of 2009, in connection to the occurrence of a benthic nepheloid layer.

40|$|Purpose: Investigate the {{structure}} and properties of sintered tool materials, including cemented carbides, cermets and oxide ceramics deposited with single-layer and gradient coatings (Ti,Al) N and Ti(C,N), and to determine the dependence between the substrate type, coating material or linear variation of chemical composition and {{the structure}} and properties of the obtained tool material. Design/methodology/approach: Analysis of the structure (SEM, TEM), analysis of the mechanical and functional properties: surface roughness, microhardness tests, scratch tests, cutting tests. The Ti(C,N) and (Ti,Al) N gradient coating was investigated by XPS and AES method. X-ray qualitative phase analysis and the grazing incidence X-ray diffraction method (GIXRD) was employed to collect the detailed information about phase composition of investigated material’s surface layer. Computer simulation of stresses {{was carried out in}} ANSYS environment, using the FEM method and the experimental values of stresses were determined basing on the X-ray diffraction patterns. Findings: Results of the investigation the influence of PVD coatings structure (single-layer or gradient) and kind on properties of coated tool materials. Coatings are characterized by dense, compact structure. The coatings were deposited uniformly onto the investigated substrate materials and show a characteristic columnar, fine-graded structure. The coatings deposited onto the investigated substrates are characterised by good adhesion and causes increasing of wear resistance. Gradient coatings are characterized by a linear change of chemical composition in the direction from the substrate to the coating surface. A more advantageous distribution of stresses in gradient coatings than in respective single-layer coatings yields better mechanical properties, and, in particular, the distribution of stresses on the coating surface has the influence on microhardness, and the distribution of stresses in the contact area between the coating and substrate has the influence on the adhesion of coatings. Practical implications: Deposition of hard, thin, gradient coatings on materials surface by PVD method features one of the most intensely developed directions of improvement of the working properties of materials. Originality/value: The grazing incidence X-ray diffraction method (GIXRD) and using the XPS and AES method in the investigated coatings were used to describe the <b>gradient</b> <b>character</b> of the coatings. The computer simulation is based on the finite element method, which allows to better understand the interdependence between parameters of process and choosing optimal solution...|$|R
