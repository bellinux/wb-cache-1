40|$|The {{narrative}} learning cycle {{outlined in}} this article was developed to address three perceived weaknesses in experiential learning cycles and involved three shifts: a shift from one concrete experience to multiple stories; a shift from individual action to social performance; and a shift from an emphasis on cognitive learning to a development of practice. This article recounts {{the use of such}} a narrative learning cycle in the development of new practices in the design and practice of an undergraduate management course. Its concluding comments appraise the potential of a narrative learning cycle to enable a professional practitioner to take heed of voices other than their own, appreciate the unavoidably social nature of action and plan <b>their</b> <b>contribution</b> to <b>jointly</b> negotiated practice...|$|R
40|$|Learning for the Fourth Age (L 4 A) is {{a social}} {{enterprise}} which recruits, trains, places and matches volunteers (‘learning mentors’) to older people living in care settings or domiciliary settings. Older people and volunteers form partnerships which develop around a focus for learning and areas of interest identified by the older person. L 4 A promotes the value of education {{as a tool for}} increasing wellbeing in later life and its vision is to improve quality of life through mental, social and emotional stimulation tailored towards vulnerable older people. We report on the findings of an independent evaluation, drawing on funding from the Big Lottery Silver Dreams programme. Over 12 months, using an agreed protocol, qualitative interviews with 69 people focused on five key areas determined by the organisation. Interviews included older people; learning mentors (the volunteers); L 4 A staff and directors; staff from care homes; and other stakeholders. Key records and documents relevant to the evaluation were examined. Our presentation focuses on key findings from the generative aspects of L 4 A’s work by highlighting the rich experiences of learning mentors who were unexpected mutual beneficiaries of L 4 A’s work. Learning mentors offer a unique contribution distinct from traditional befriending and through their relationships with older people demonstrated the importance of learning interventions in achieving more transformational outcomes. The extent of reciprocity and generativity identified further challenged stereotypes of older people’s contribution to social relationships. Further, for those learning mentors still studying, the experience had unexpected benefits – encouraging some to change their future career intentions, life choices and courses as well as employability. We encountered changes in career intentions, course intentions, changed family behaviours, changed work behaviours, and reflective comments on end of life experiences that were clearly life changing. Increased opportunities for networking became a demand from mentors, who recognised their own learning and the links between altruism and reciprocity. This paper aims to stimulate further debate about the complexity of the landscape in which members of the community interact with opportunities to volunteer and the challenge to <b>capitalise</b> on <b>their</b> <b>contributions</b> to transgress more traditional notions about volunteering embedded in policy. The audience will be encouraged to consider the implications for both training and supporting volunteers to <b>capitalise</b> on <b>their</b> <b>contributions</b> and to reconside...|$|R
