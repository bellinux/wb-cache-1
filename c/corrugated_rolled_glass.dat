40|$|The article {{explains}} {{the influence of}} number of passes on {{the parameters of the}} microstructure of D 16 aluminium alloy during rolling in the <b>corrugated</b> <b>rolls,</b> and the impact of the drafts while rolling of the strips on the longitudinal wedge mill. A comparative evaluation of the grain size of the ultrafine grained structure was conducted after rolling strips in the <b>corrugated</b> <b>rolls</b> by various passes, and after rolling on the longitudinal wedge mill at deformation temperature of 320 °C. It is shown that the sheet material of D 16 aluminium alloy ensures uniform formation of an ultrafine grain structure with the size of about 220 - 240 nm, which leads to increased strength properties of the alloy and preserve good ductility...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{nanostructure}} and nonlinear {{optical properties}} of high-niobium glasses in the (1 − x) KNbO 3 -xSiO 2 system with an SiO 2 content x = 0. 05 - 0. 35 {{have been studied}} by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), electron microscopy (EM), and second-optical-harmonic generation (SHG). Vitreous samples are manufactured by the methods of fast melt cooling (pressing with metal plates and quenching between rotating <b>rolls).</b> <b>Glasses</b> with x 0. 2 are homogeneous, but form a silica-enriched nanostructure after thermal treatments. At temperatures below ∼T g + 50 °C, silica-enriched regions manifest a very slight tendency to grow, whereas, according to SANS and X-ray diffraction data, their chemical composition is observed to shift appreciably towards SiO 2 with thermal treatment. The obtained data on an inhomogeneous structure allows us to clarify the complicated character of the previously revealed dependence T g (x). Nano-inhomogeneous transparent samples produce a weak SHG signal, which indicates the quasi-periodic modulation of the chemical composition and, correspondingly, polarizability, in the volume of glass. The nonlinear optical phase KNbO 3 precipitates at later stages of crystallization, when a glass loses its transparency. In this case, the SHG signal is amplified by several orders of magnitude...|$|R

40|$|The {{strength}} of float glass {{is a necessary}} engineering parameter. Determining this strength is a complex problem. Earlier results have shown that statistically bending test results are not a homogeneous group. To explain this, a theoiy of "hidden damage" is proposed. The essence of this {{theory is that the}} different sides of float glass are unequal, {{not only because of the}} differences between the Tin and nitrogen sides, but because of the difference between the side scored under the sheet glass cutting and the side which has the crack propagation ftom the scored side in breaking. Extensive tests on <b>rolled</b> <b>glass</b> suggest that the rolling process damages the glass in a special way, causing "invisible" damage - statistically not a homogeneous distribution of micro-cracks on the edge surface of glass element. These micro-cracks are different on the scored and broken sides of glass. They are the fracture source under the loading and influence negatively on glass element strength and statistics of strength data. This "invisible" damage explains most if not all of the non-homogenous distribution of the test results. It is shown that removal of this damage on the edges of glass elements increases the engineering {{strength of}} float glass significantly. Building TechnologyArchitectur...|$|R
