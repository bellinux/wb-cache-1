500|$|Although Milian was a {{songwriter}} since her teenagers years, she only felt real growth during the production sessions when Dre told her, [...] "there are no rules". Previously, Milian would write songs that followed rules, {{where she would}} have a hook, a verse, and another verse with similar sound and melody. For So Amazin, she wrote with a [...] "no rules theory", which was her biggest obstacle while recording the album. She said, [...] "It was just, you know what? I can change up the melody I can do different things. Sometimes I might get stuck but wait half an hour and it'll <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> end up being hot. So that's probably my biggest obstacle, just stepping away from doing the usual that I know and stepping into something new. Once I got past all that, it was just easy. With flying colors, I started writing all the records." ...|$|E
