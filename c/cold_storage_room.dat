Dr. Silva locks Lincoln in a <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>room,</b> while Fauxlivia falls through a weakened floor and passes out. She is woken by Dr. Silva, but finds herself secured to a chair.

Fauxlivia feels pains in her body when Dr. Silva implies the last cycle has begun, believing herself to be the host.|$|E
5|$|Enrollment {{continued}} to rise, {{and by the}} end of his tenure, Ross requested that parents first communicate with his office before sending their sons to the school. The increase in students necessitated an improvement in facilities, and from late 1891 until September 1898, the college spent over $97,000 on improvements and new buildings. This included construction of a mess hall, which could seat 500 diners at once, an infirmary, which included the first indoor toilets on campus, an artesian well, a natatorium, four faculty residences, an electric light plant, an ice works, a laundry, a <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>room,</b> a slaughterhouse, a gymnasium, a warehouse, and an artillery shed. Despite the expenditures on facilities, the school treasury held a surplus in 1893 and 1894. The 1894 financial report credited the surplus to Ross's leadership, and Ross ensured the money was returned to the students in the form of lower fees.|$|E

50|$|In 1892, Dairy Farm built a {{low-rise}} {{brick and}} stucco building on Lower Albert Road in Central {{for use as}} a cold storage warehouse.

When every meat locker art director Doug McLean scouted in Vancouver, where Battlestar Galactica was filmed, proved too small or too cold to film in, production designer Richard Hudolin built the <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> on a set with a window that would suggest a meat locker in the next room.|$|E
5000|$|The {{story of}} the Refrigerator Cats became more {{elaborate}} as it was reprinted elsewhere.

[...] This, according to the stories, necessitated the introduction of cats into the warehouses.

The immense <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> depot which had just been completed at Manila was in need of cats. According to the Pittsburgh Chronicle Telegraph, the facility was to be supplied with cats developed about five or six years earlier at the Union Storage company. The Union Storage company was said to have experimented with various cat breeds to find cats suitable for living in the cold rooms. It had, according to the news story, tried a pair of high-bred cats, but they had sickened and died. Finally a pair of white felines without a pedigree were obtained and were first placed In the general <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> for a time; and then into a room where the temperature was gradually lowered until it was below the freezing point.
