25|$|A {{term with}} no indeterminates and a {{polynomial}} with no indeterminates are called, respectively, a <b>constant</b> <b>term</b> and a constant polynomial. The degree of a <b>constant</b> <b>term</b> {{and of a}} nonzero constant polynomial is 0. The degree of the zero polynomial, 0, (which has no terms at all) is generally treated as not defined (but see below).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Most of the {{potential}} function expressions subjected to function finding contain <b>constant</b> <b>terms.</b> Gene Expression Programming (GEP) ’s effectiveness of function finding has been severely limited {{due to a lack}} of constant creating ability. Though this issue has been realized and discussed by many GEP researchers, an efficient method has never been established. This paper presents a new method to find functions with <b>constant</b> <b>terms</b> in the context of GEP. Experiments show its performance is outstanding: for simple integer <b>constant</b> <b>terms,</b> it surpasses original GEP up to 1 - 2 orders of magnitude in terms of efficiency, and for fractional <b>constant</b> <b>terms,</b> it provides an exclusive solution which no existing methods could ever achieve. ...|$|R
5000|$|Put in the {{simplest}} terms the [...] "philosophy of cusp forms" [...] says that for each Γ-conjugacy classes of Q-rational parabolic subgroups one should construct automorphic functions (from objects from spaces of lower dimensions) whose <b>constant</b> <b>terms</b> are zero for other conjugacy classes and the <b>constant</b> <b>terms</b> for {{an element of the}} given class give all <b>constant</b> <b>terms</b> for this parabolic subgroup. This is almost possible and leads to a description of all automorphic forms in terms of these constructs and cusp forms. The construction that does this is the Eisenstein series.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we compute <b>constant</b> <b>terms</b> of Eisenstein series defined over {{a totally}} real field, at various cusps. In his paper {{published}} in 2003, M. Ohta computed the <b>constant</b> <b>terms</b> of Eisenstein series of weight two {{over the field}} of rational numbers, at all equivalence classes of cusps. As for Eisenstein series defined over a totally real field, S. Dasgupta, H. Darmon and R. Pollack calculated the <b>constant</b> <b>terms</b> at particular (not all) equivalence classes of cusps in 2011. We compute <b>constant</b> <b>terms</b> of Eisenstein series defined over a general totally real field at all equivalence classes of cusps, and describe them explicitly in terms of Hecke $L$-functions. This investigation is motivated by M. Ohta's work on congruence modules related to Eisenstein series defined over the field of rational numbers. Comment: 22 page...|$|R

25|$|The {{movement}} of the supply curve {{in response to a}} change in a non-price determinant of supply is caused by a change in the y-intercept, the <b>constant</b> <b>term</b> of the supply equation. The supply curve shifts up and down the y axis as non-price determinants of demand change.|$|E
25|$|The theorem {{can be used}} to {{establish}} a number of theoretical results.

25|$|However, this {{identification}} is inexact: a polynomial-time solution with large exponent or large <b>constant</b> <b>term</b> grows quickly, {{and may be}} impractical for practical size problems; conversely, an exponential-time solution that grows slowly may be practical on realistic input, or a solution that {{takes a long time}} in the worst case may take a short time in most cases or the average case, and thus still be practical. Saying that a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example, the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem.|$|E
