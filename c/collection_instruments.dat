In 2013, two data collectors independently evaluated 21 stores in two census tracts, through a data <b>collection</b> <b>instrument</b> that assessed the presence of price promotions, whether single cigarettes were sold, the number of visible advertisements, the pre- sence of signage prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to minors, and characteristics of cigarette pack displays. We evaluated the inter-rater reliability of the collected data, through the calculation of metrics such as intraclass correlation coefficient, percent agreement, Cohen’s kappa and Krippendorff’s alpha.

5000|$|Language {{also plays}} an {{important}} part in the evaluation process, as language is tied closely to culture. [...] Language can be a major barrier to communicating concepts which the evaluator is trying to access, and translation is often required. [...] There are a multitude of problems with translation, including the loss of meaning as well as the exaggeration or enhancement of meaning by translators. [...] For example, terms which are contextually specific may not translate into another language with the same weight or meaning. In particular, data <b>collection</b> <b>instruments</b> need to take meaning into account as the subject matter may not be considered sensitive in a particular context might prove to be sensitive in {{the context in which the}} evaluation is taking place. [...] Thus, evaluators need to take into account two important concepts when administering data collection tools: lexical equivalence and conceptual equivalence. [...] Lexical equivalence asks the question: how does one phrase a question in two languages using the same words? This is a difficult task to accomplish, and uses of techniques such as back-translation may aid the evaluator but may not result in perfect transference of meaning. [...] This leads to the next point, conceptual equivalence. It is not a common occurrence for concepts to transfer unambiguously from one culture to another. [...] Data <b>collection</b> <b>instruments</b> which have not undergone adequate testing and piloting may therefore render results which are not useful as the concepts which are measured by the instrument may have taken on a different meaning and thus rendered the instrument unreliable and invalid.|$|E
50|$|Survey {{methodology}} as {{a scientific}} field seeks to identify principles about the sample design, data <b>collection</b> <b>instruments,</b> statistical adjustment of data, and data processing, and final data analysis that can create systematic and random survey errors. Survey errors are sometimes analyzed in connection with survey cost. Cost constraints are sometimes framed as improving quality within cost constraints, or alternatively, reducing costs for a fixed level of quality. Survey methodology is both a scientific field and a profession, meaning that some {{professionals in the field}} focus on survey errors empirically and others design surveys to reduce them. For survey designers, the task involves making a large set of decisions about thousands of individual features of a survey in order to improve it.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the context}} of MASINT, [...] "measurement" [...] relates to the finite metric {{parameters}} of targets. [...] "Signature" [...] covers the distinctive features of phenomena, equipment, or objects as they are sensed by the <b>collection</b> <b>instrument(s).</b> The signature is used to recognize the phenomenon (the equipment or object) once its distinctive features are detected. MASINT measurement searches for differences from known norms, and characterizes the signatures of new phenomena. For example, {{the first time a}} new rocket fuel exhaust is measured, it would be a deviation from a norm. When the properties of that exhaust are measured, such as its thermal energy, spectral analysis of its light (i.e., spectrometry), etc., those properties become a new signature in the MASINT database.|$|E

NCHS's State and Local Area Integrated Telephone Survey (SLAITS) produces state-level data on such topics as the health of children with special needs, to meet the data needs of our colleagues in HHS’ Maternal and Child Health Bureau and elsewhere. NCHS's National Immunization Survey is done collaboration with other CDC offices in Atlanta. NCHS's National Death Index creates a longitudinal component to other routine data systems.

The guideline recommends that the translation of data <b>collection</b> <b>instruments</b> from a source language into a target language be conducted using a translation team. The guideline relies on the cross-cultural and survey methodology research literature and specifies and describes five steps that comprise the translation process. These steps are: Prepare, Translate, Pretest, Revise, and Document.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the design of}} data <b>collection</b> <b>instruments</b> that include the opinions of blind students, {{in accordance with the}} principles of Universal Design (UD). The aim {{of this study is to}} understand the importance of adapting data <b>collection</b> <b>instruments</b> for the inclusion of disabled persons in field research in Architecture and Design, among other fields. The data <b>collection</b> <b>instruments</b> developed were a play interview with a tactile map and a 3 D survey with the use of tactile models. These instruments sought to assess the school environment experienced by blind students. The study involved students from the early years of a school for the blind who had not yet mastered the Braille system. The participation of these students was evaluated. A multidisciplinary team consisting of architects, designers, educators, and psychologists lent support to the study. The results showed that the data <b>collection</b> <b>instruments</b> adapted to blind students were successful in making the group of authors examine questions regarding UD. An analysis of the participatory phase showed that the limitations resulting from blindness determine the specificities in the adaptation and implementation process of the instruments in schools. Practical recommendations for future studies related to instruments in the UD thematic are presented. This approach is in line with the global trend of including disabled persons in society based on these users’ opinions concerning what was designed by architects and designers. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|AbstractREDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is {{a web-based}} {{software}} solution and tool set that allows biomedical researchers to create secure online forms for data capture, management and analysis with minimal effort and training. The Shared Data Instrument Library (SDIL) {{is a relatively}} new component of REDCap that allows sharing of commonly used data <b>collection</b> <b>instruments</b> for immediate study use by research teams. Objectives of the SDIL project include: (1) facilitating reuse of data dictionaries and reducing duplication of effort; (2) promoting the use of validated data <b>collection</b> <b>instruments,</b> data standards and best practices; and (3) promoting research collaboration and data sharing. Instruments submitted to the library are reviewed by a library oversight committee, with rotating membership from multiple institutions, which ensures quality, relevance and legality of shared instruments. The design allows researchers to download the instruments in a consumable electronic format in the REDCap environment. At the time of this writing, the SDIL contains over 128 data <b>collection</b> <b>instruments.</b> Over 2500 instances of instruments have been downloaded by researchers at multiple institutions. In this paper we describe the library platform, provide detail about experience gained during the first 25 months of sharing public domain instruments and provide evidence of impact for the SDIL across the REDCap consortium research community.
