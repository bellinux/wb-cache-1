50|$|The {{number of}} persons {{crossing}} the border illegally into Canada in the Emerson-Pembina area has spiked in recent years, especially following President Donald Trump's Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States executive order in January 2017. The majority of recent border jumpers are immigrants from Somalia, Ghana, and other African nations seeking asylum in Canada to avoid potential deportation from the U.S. Although persons claiming refugee status {{are not permitted to}} migrate to Canada from the U.S. (or vice-versa) under the two countries' Safe Third <b>Country</b> <b>Agreement,</b> a well known loophole allows asylum seekers who cross the border illegally and then report to the local police to stay in Canada while their application to live in Canada is processed. This practice is not without danger, especially during the cold prairie winter. On December 24, 2016, two Ghanaian men successfully made it across the border by walking several miles along the Red River in sub-zero temperatures; however both suffered severe frostbite that required amputation of their fingers. This garnered international media attention and led many groups to ask the Canadian government to suspend the Safe <b>Country</b> <b>Agreement</b> in light of the current political climate in the U.S.|$|E

CIFOR’s Establishment Agreement was signed by Australia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States; the Agreement was lodged with the United Nations and CIFOR's legal identity as an international organisation was consolidated with a Host <b>Country</b> <b>Agreement</b> between the new Board and the Government of Indonesia in May 1993.|$|E

50|$|The Safe Third <b>Country</b> <b>Agreement</b> {{applies to}} refugee claimants {{who are seeking}} entry to Canada or the United States at Canada-United States land border {{crossings}} (including by train). It also applies at airports if a person seeking refugee protection in one country {{was determined not to}} be a refugee in the other, and is in transit through the other country as part of their deportation. For example, a refugee claimant in Canada who has been determined not to be a refugee in the United States, has been ordered deported from the United States, and is in transit through a Canadian airport as part of their removal from the United States.|$|E

Since AFTRA adhered to a bargaining principle that no general agreement exists until all Codes and Contracts are acceptable, the 13-day strike involved all 18,000 members {{in more than}} 100 locations across the <b>country.</b> <b>Agreement</b> was reached on the outstanding issues at 8:05 pm, EST, on Monday, April 10, 1967—just in time to allow broadcast of the annual Academy Awards program live from the Santa Monica Auditorium.|$|E
50|$|Safe {{third country}} {{agreements}} are not explicitly {{mentioned in the}} 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. Instead, their legality is derived from Article 31 of the convention, which states that a refugee should not be punished for illegally entering a country if they are arriving directly from a country where they were under threat. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) itself has cautioned against interpreting safe third country agreements too broadly, though it acknowledges {{that they may be}} acceptable in some circumstances. Such ambiguities have led some legal professionals in Canada to question the legality of the Canada-United States Safe Third <b>Country</b> <b>Agreement.</b>|$|E
