2500|$|The area of {{arable land}} farmed {{by a family}} was notionally {{suitable}} for two or three plough teams, allocated in runrigs. Runrigs, were a ridge and furrow pattern, similar to that used in parts of England, with alternating [...] "runs" [...] (furrows) and [...] "rigs" [...] (ridges). They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset some of the problems of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective on heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. They were usually pulled by a team of eight oxen, which would have taken four men to operate and only covered half an acre a day. In the late sixteenth century population growth in the west Highlands prompted an abandonment of ploughing in favour of more intensive <b>cultivation</b> <b>methods</b> using spades and foot ploughs (cas chrom) with lazy beds, which produced larger furrows with narrower channels between and allowed arable cultivation in locations where ploughing would have been impossible. Pasture was often accessed by shieling-grounds, with shelters made of stone or turf, used for the grazing of cattle in summer. These would often be distant from the main settlements in the Lowlands, but might be relatively close in the more remote Highlands. All farms combined livestock with arable farming, with cattle and sheep and goats in parts of the Highlands and all farms growing some grain. However, there was some specialisation, with arable most important in the East and there was a tradition of sheep farming in the eastern Borders dating back to the arrival of new monastic orders in the twelfth century, which continued after the secularisation of the monasteries.|$|E

For this study grassland biodiversity recordings of 12 organic and 12 conventional farms were analysed in a pairwise comparison. These results were then applied to the economic factors of the farms. Significant differences in biodiversity were found within <b>cultivations</b> <b>methods</b> and type of farms.

40|$|Momordica charantia L. {{has been}} used in Asian {{traditional}} medicines for a long time (Kumar et al., 2010), but in our country is less know. Some products of fruit extracts are present in the pharmaceutical industry in Romania. Encapsulated products are valued for regulating triglyceride or cholesterol. In Asia (China, Japan and India), the fruits are used for diet of diabetic people and for curing people in natural medicine (Kumar et al., 2010; Fohs et al., 2014). The aim of this paper was to find the best way of cultivation to obtain high yield and quality fruits. This study can help to promote this crop in our country, especially for pharmaceutical industry. Biological material is represented by ‘Enaja’ new cultivar of Momordica charantia L. This was used to establish the early production of bitter gourd. The experiments were carried out in 2015 in a greenhouse belonging to UASMV Cluj – Napoca. As an experimental factor different cultivation way was used (one branch, two branches and main stem). The harvest of early production was in 24. 08. 2015. Obtained results was statistically interpeted using Duncan test. The higher early production (0, 72 kg/plant, respectiv 0, 93 kg/sm) was registred if the cultivation way was on two branches. The lowest crop production (0, 53 kg/plant, respectiv 0, 69 kg/mp) was in case of cultivation on the main stem.
