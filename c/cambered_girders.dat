40|$|The camber at {{the time}} of bridge {{erection}} of prestressed concrete bridge girders predicted by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) was observed to often overestimate the measured <b>cambers</b> of <b>girders</b> erected at bridge sites in Minnesota, which, in some cases, was causing significant problems related to the formation of the bridge deck profile, the composite behavior of the girders and bridge deck, delays in construction and increased costs. Extensive historical data was collected from two precasting plants and MN counties and it was found that, on average, the measured cambers at release and erection were only 74 % and 83. 5 %, respectively, of the design values. Through data collection, analysis, and material testing, {{it was found that the}} primary causes of the low camber at release were concrete release strengths that exceeded the design values, the use of an equation for concrete elastic modulus that greatly under-predicted the measured values, and thermal prestress losses not accounted for in design. Fourteen girders were instrumented and their camber measured and the program PBEAM was used to evaluate the influence of various time-dependent effects (i. e., solar radiation, relative humidity, concrete creep and shrinkage, length of cure and bunking/storage conditions) on long-term camber. Once investigated, these effects were included in long-term camber predictions that were used to create sets of both time-dependent and singlevalue camber multipliers. The use of these multipliers, along with modifications made to the elastic release camber calculations, greatly reduced the observed discrepancy between measured and design release and erection cambers.

40|$|Inaccurate {{prediction}} of long-term camber in precast prestressed concrete beams (PPCB) creates discrepancies in bridge construction {{which results in}} increased costs and construction challenges. Although {{emphasis is placed on}} erection and long-term camber, these challenges have been found to originate from the difference between the estimated design and measured camber at the transfer of prestress and will continue to increase with time. The estimate of the instantaneous camber is influenced by factors such as the method used for determining the camber as well as the assumed modulus of elasticity and initial prestress, while the measured camber can be affected by the measurement technique, quality of formwork and construction, and uniformity of concrete. To systematically study and eliminate the construction challenges associated with <b>camber</b> of precast <b>girders,</b> a research project was undertaken to examine the differences between the measured and designed <b>camber</b> of Iowa <b>girders</b> from fabrication through erection. This thesis focuses on the causes of error found with instantaneous camber by examining the designer 2 ̆ 7 s prediction method and variables used for design, the construction practices used for producing a PPCB, and the precasters camber measurement method adopted by the precast industry. While the discrepancy between the measured and designed camber was found to be dependent on the girder type, the designed camber was underestimated due to inaccurate variables used for material properties and the design prestress force. In depth analysis was conducted to investigate different methods of camber prediction and to determine the effects that material properties have on camber. Evaluation of the historical camber measurements that were previously recorded using the current measurement technique revealed that camber is over predicted the majority of the time. Further examination of historical data exposed insufficient data that did not accurately capture the instantaneous camber. For this reason, precasters fabrication procedures were observed and instantaneous camber was measured by the project team from over 100 girders. Observations and independent camber measurements taken by the research team led to the identification of discrepancies between predicted and measured instantaneous camber. Results found that friction, bed deflections, inconsistent top flange surfaces due to the finish that is applied, and inconsistent top flange surfaces due to the beam depth not being uniform {{along the length of the}} beam currently produce an average error of 17. 6...|$|R

The pre-release cracks were observed to begin at the top flange and extend into {{the depth of the}} section, sometimes penetrating through the entire depth. The cracks close due to the effects of prestressing and girder self-weight when the prestressing strands are released. The objective of this report was to determine the effects these pre-release cracks have on <b>girder</b> <b>camber,</b> flexural cracking capacity, and steel stress ranges. The research included a parametric study investigating stress ranges in the prestressing strands in uncracked, cracked, and partially cracked girder sections to determine if steel fatigue was a concern. An analytical study was also performed which modeled several pre-release cracks, including models of two experimental girders that developed pre-release cracks, to determine the effect of various cracks on <b>girder</b> stress and <b>camber.</b> It was found that steel fatigue in the prestressing strand is a concern in girders that become cracked in service. Fatigue of the steel strands has typically not been a concern in prestressed girders because the girders are designed so the section remains uncracked under service load.

Taking 50 / 10 [*]t bridge crane as a research object, the probability loads are determined by analysis of load distribution density functions.

Although metal formwork in the building industry is routinely relied on for stability bracing, the forms are not permitted for bracing in the bridge industry, despite the large in-plane stiffness. The forms in bridge applications are typically supported on cold-formed angles, which allow the contractor to adjust the form elevation to account for changes in flange thickness and differential <b>camber</b> between adjacent <b>girders.</b> Although the support angles are beneficial toward the constructability of the bridge, they lead to eccentric connections that substantially reduce the in-plane stiffness of the PMDF systems, {{which is one of}} the reasons the forms are not relied on for bracing in bridge applications.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. December 2011. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor: Dr. Catherine French. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 225 pages, appendices A-H. The camber, or total net upward deflection, of prestressed concrete bridge girders {{is the result}} of the eccentric axial compression force provided by prestressing strands which counteract the deflections due to gravity loads. At the time of strand release, the deflection behavior of prestressed concrete girders is considered to be elastic, and it is common for bridge designers to use elastic camber calculations to predict the camber at release. To estimate the <b>girder</b> <b>camber</b> at bridge erection, a multiplier method is typically used which amplifies the camber at release to roughly account for the time-dependent effects (e. g., creep and shrinkage) that occur between release and erection. Additionally, there are numerous factors which affect the camber at erection and are not known at the time of design, including the girder storage condition in the precasting yard (i. e., bunking) and the age of the girder at erection, that further lead to potential errors in the estimates of the <b>girder</b> <b>camber</b> at erection. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) uses the release camber calculations, based on gross section properties and elastic shortening losses, and a multiplier method to predict the camber at release and erection, respectively. An accurate estimate of camber at erection is important, because if the girders that arrive at a bridge site have cambers that are much lower or much higher than the expected design erection camber, it causes significant problems related to the formation of the bridge deck profile, the composite behavior of the girders and bridge deck, negative or very high stool height requirements, delays in construction and increased costs. It was recently observed that girders were being erected at bridge sites in Minnesota with cambers that were often much lower than predicted. The main side effect of this problem is required stool heights that are too high, especially at midspan. If the required stool heights approach the height of the protruding top flange shear reinforcement, the composite action needed between the girders and the bridge deck cannot be achieved, thus requiring the use of additional reinforcement or changing the entire bridge deck profile, which adds cost and creates delays. To account for this issue, MnDOT switched in late 2007 from the multiplier method recommended by Leslie A. Martin (1977) and PCI (2010), to a universal multiplier of 1. 5. However, the problem persisted and added costs and delays continued to occur. The primary objective of this study was to investigate and determine the cause of low <b>girder</b> <b>camber</b> at both release and bridge erection, which was observed by MnDOT, and to create an improved method for camber prediction, through modified calculations (if necessary) and a new set of multipliers. This objective was achieved through examination of extensive camber records from precasting plants and from in-situ measurements during erection of Minnesota I-girders, instrumentation and camber monitoring of fourteen girders from release to erection, concrete material testing, an analysis of prestress losses due to thermal effects, and PBEAM time-dependent camber modeling to investigate various effects including creep and shrinkage, girder support conditions during storage and age at erection. Extensive historical fabrication data was collected from two precasting plants (referred to as Plant A and B) for 1067 girders produced between 2006 and 2010. Camber at erection data was collected from the counties for 768 of those girders. On average, it was found that the measured camber at release for those 1067 girders was only 74 % of the design value. Furthermore, it was found that the measured camber at erection for the 768 girders was only 83. 5 %, on average, of the design value; and that girders erected at early ages almost always had cambers that were significantly lower than the design value. Because the predicted camber at erection is obtained by amplifying the elastic camber at release, inaccurate estimates of the camber at release can compound the problems of estimating the camber at erection. Various factors that affect the release camber were investigated, including concrete strength and modulus of elasticity, and variation in the strand prestress force. It was found that the increased concrete strengths achieved at the precasting plants (15. 5 % over the specified design value, on average) decrease camber due to the increased elastic modulus. Multiple concrete cylinder samples from both precasting plants were tested to investigate the concrete strength and elastic modulus over time. It was found that the ACI 363 R- 10 expression used by MnDOT to estimate the concrete modulus of elasticity from the specified concrete compressive strength greatly underestimates the elastic modulus of concrete produced at both precasting plants. The Pauw (ACI 318 - 08, AASHTO LRFD 2010) equation was determined to be the best predictor of the concrete elastic modulus, and when used to recalculate the release camber predictions for the 1067 historical girders, yielded significantly more accurate results. A thermal effects analysis was conducted to determine the effect of concrete and ambient temperatures on the strand stress at release. It was found that the combined thermal effects (and strand relaxation) cause a reduction in strand stress at release of approximately 3 %, on average. The position of each girder in the bed was also found to cause variations in prestress force through the redistribution of draped strand stress due to the harping sequence (at Plant A) and friction losses (at Plant B). Finally, it was found that high strand density, though often found in long MN-shape girders which had slightly lower release cambers, was not a major cause of reduced release camber. Thus, it was determined that the major causes for the discrepancy in release camber predictions and observed cambers were the increased concrete release strengths, the fact that the ACI 363 equation for concrete elastic modulus underestimated the measured elastic moduli, and strand prestress losses due to thermal effects. The effects of these primary factors were considered in re-predicting the cambers of a select data set for which detailed fabrication data, including curing and temperature records, were known. The girders included in this data set were those from which the concrete material samples were obtained, the instrumented girders, and selected girders from the historical data set. It was found that the accuracy of the re-predicted cambers was much greater than the original design cambers, and that the amount of variability in the results was reduced. Recommendations for modified camber calculations were made based on average effects (i. e., 15. 5 % release concrete strength increase, the Pauw equation for estimating concrete elastic modulus, and thermal prestress losses of 3 %). These recommendations were then tested against the entire historical girder database, and it was found that the discrepancy between measured and design camber values improved from approximately 74 % to 99 %, on average. This result confirmed that the revised release camber calculations provided much more accurate camber predictions than the original design equations. It should be noted that the overall scatter was not reduced because the recommendations were implemented in an average sense to all 1067 girders in the historical database. Once the discrepancy between measured and design release camber values was determined, various factors that affect long-term and erection camber were investigated, including solar radiation, relative humidity, concrete creep and shrinkage, length of cure and bunking/storage conditions. The program PBEAM was also validated for use in release and long-term camber modeling. It was found that solar radiation affects the measurement of camber by as much as 15 % during the course of a day, emphasizing that camber is a constantly fluctuating value. Relative humidity was found to cause changes in concrete creep and shrinkage and induce camber variability. High relative humidity during the winter months was also observed to cause slight increases in camber. Through PBEAM validation, it was found that the ACI 209 R- 92 concrete creep and shrinkage models provided the best results for long-term camber predictions and that the Mokhtarzadeh ACI 209 variation models provided a consistent lower bound. As such, the ACI 209 R- 92 creep and shrinkage models were used in the time-dependent camber modeling predictions. Weekend curing was found to cause lower erection <b>cambers</b> than weekday-cured <b>girders,</b> even though the camber discrepancy at release was less evident, due to additional stress recovery from cooler curing conditions. Finally, it was found that bunking/storage conditions led to increased cambers, additional camber variability, and possible exceedance of codified stress limits. Bunking limitations were recommended in order to limit these undesirable effects. These observations and results were used to create PBEAM inputs and ensuing long-term <b>camber</b> predictions for <b>girders</b> of varying depth and length. From these results, four “sets” of multipliers were created by comparing the long-term camber predictions to the current MnDOT and improved release camber predictions. Two of the sets of multipliers were developed to be applied to the MnDOT approach to predict release camber, and the other two were developed to be applied to the improved release camber predictions. For each approach, one set was based on a single multiplier to best predict erection camber and the other set recommended four different multipliers that reflected approximate age ranges for the girders at erection. These four different sets of multipliers were then applied to the historical girder data set and compared to the measured erection camber data. It was found that all four sets of multipliers greatly improved the erection camber predictions, with average measured vs. adjusted design erection camber percent values of 95. 6 %- 97. 1 %. However, only the “time-dependent” multipliers, which accounted for four potential ranges in girder age at erection, reduced the amount of scatter in the results. In particular, these multipliers alleviated the problem of over-predicted erection <b>cambers</b> for <b>girders</b> erected at early ages. Both the improved release camber predictions and the “Improved Time-Dependent” multipliers are recommended to be used by MnDOT for future camber predictions. In addition to the recommendations for the modified camber calculations at release and the new set of multipliers, recommendations for girder fabrication were also created to reduce camber variability and improve girder production at the precasting plants. Included in these recommendations are limitations for bunking/storage conditions and a spreadsheet created to produce more accurate temperature corrections (for Plants A and B). It was found that the amount of camber variability that can be expected using the recommended calculations and multipliers is approximately ± 15 %, or even lower if the girder fabrication recommendations are put into practice...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Most of {{the modern}} medium-span bridges in the United States are {{constructed}} with precast, prestressed concrete girders. An accurate estimate of <b>girder</b> <b>camber</b> is important for all parties involved in the precast concrete industry for several reasons. The most important reason is that achieving vertical alignment, and casting the deck, becomes much more difficult if the cambers of two adjacent girders in the bridge are not the same, since the girders are generally too large to make the correction by brute force. In addition, any uncertainty of the estimated camber in the precast, prestressed concrete girders can lead to construction delays and can increase material and labor costs. However, the prediction and control of camber over time is difficult, because camber varies with many parameters, such as the concrete properties, curing methods, and temperature variations. The goal {{of this research is}} to improve the methods to predict camber in precast, prestressed concrete girders, with an emphasis on determining the effect of temperature on camber both during curing and in service. The research focused on monitoring and collecting fabrication camber to calibrate the current models for predicting camber. Temperature histories at release and service were also recorded to examine the effect of fabrication temperatures on initial camber and the effect of daily temperature variations on service camber. Two models were developed to predict daily camber changes under solar radiation based on ambient temperature data.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 Concrete fabricators, {{contractors}} and designers need accurate predictions of time-dependent deformations of concrete, such as creep and shrinkage. This {{is especially true}} for fabricators of precast, prestressed bridge girders, for which large differences in <b>camber</b> between adjacent <b>girders</b> can lead to significant contractual difficulties, increased cost, and legal consequences. In order to improve predictions of these deformations, good quality data and computationally convenient and well-calibrated models are needed. Fabricators often use accelerated curing regimes to make the concrete gain strength faster and thus increase girder production rates. Little data currently exist on the creep and shrinkage characteristics of concrete for such a curing regime, and current models have not been calibrated using concrete of this type. In this research, an experiment was conducted to obtain data on the creep and shrinkage of high-strength concrete with an accelerated curing regime. Current prediction models of creep and shrinkage all assume a constant stress history and deal with changes in stress by applying the principle of superposition, originally proposed in 1943. The validity of the application of the principle of superposition to creep strains has been greatly debated, and the experimental program was partly designed to test this assumption. Dealing with variable stresses through the use of superposition is not computationally convenient. A new one-dimensional rate-type model based on visco-elastic behavior was designed and calibrated using data from the experiments. This new model can deal with variable stresses without the need for superposition. Several configurations of the model were calibrated, and a good fit was achieved to creep data from concrete with a diverse set of loading and unloading histories...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the demand}} for slim constructions and {{improvement}} of erection methods on building site composite slim-floor systems become more important. In the present european and national codes do not include complete design rules for slim-floor constructions. Therefore {{the objective of this}} thesis is concentrated on the development of design rules for slim-floor girders. During the erection stage the elastic design resistance of the steel girder is decisive. Because of the slight plate thickness and sometimes considerable torsional stressing the influence of the shape deformation becomes more important and has to be considered. In this approach the steel sections are filled with concrete in the final state. Thereby the concrete in the openings, arranged in the web or upper flange, work concurrently as concrete dowels. The determination of moment resistance follows the rules for composite structures, respectively whereas in many cases the strain limited design is relevant and additionally the influences from transverse bending in the bottom flange have to be considered. Because of the sheathing of the concrete encasement by the steel section a hybrid truss model with a compression strut in the concrete section is developed, increasing the shear of the section. In case of fire, the directly flamed bottom flange can be substituted by longitudinal reinforcement bars and a high fire resistance period can be realized without any additional activities. For the analysis in case of fire, a design-method is extracted according to EN 1994 - 1 - 2. Based on a transient analysis, thermal analytic functions are developed to describe the temperature distribution in the cross section. The crack behaviour of the concrete slab has already {{a significant impact on the}} girder deformation in the serviceability limit state. The concrete flange adopts a remarkable part of the bending-moment. Compared to general treatment of common composite girders, the neglecting of these bending influences can lead to unrealistic <b>camber</b> of the <b>girder.</b> Therefore, an approximation procedure is derived that considers the bearing of the resilience of composite connector and the crack behaviour on the structure deformation...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Fabricators and {{contractors}} need accurate prediction of the camber in precast, prestressed, concrete girders. Large {{differences in the}} <b>camber</b> between adjacent <b>girders</b> lead to significant construction difficulties that often have financial and/or legal ramifications. Many factors affect the time-dependent deflections of these girders including; creep and shrinkage of concrete, prestressing relaxation, temperature variations and numerous fabrication conditions. The current models used to predict the deflection history are largely empirical and, although they account approximately {{for some of the}} important effects, they do not explicitly consider the interactions among these factors. The goal of this research was to generate a camber prediction algorithm that links the time-dependent constitutive models and explicitly considers the fabrication conditions. This was done by using classical structural analysis techniques and combining them with explicit, time-dependent material models. The analysis was divided into four time phases that encompass a girder's life-span, from fabrication through it service life. These phases are: *	Strand jacking: The phase during which the prestressing strands are brought up to their specified jacking stress, *	Pre-bonding: The phase during which the prestressing strands are anchored to the abutments in the casting bed, but the strands have not yet bonded to the surrounding concrete, *	Post-bonding: The phase during which the concrete has bonded to the strands, but the girder is still resting in the casting bed, and the strands are still restrained by the abutments. *	Post-release: The phase during which the prestressing strands have been released from the abutments and the girder is removed from the casting bed. This phase includes the entire service life. In each of these four phases, the boundary conditions are different and the system is analyzed to determine the stresses, deformations and deflected shape. The calculations are necessarily iterative because the constitutive laws for the strand and concrete are time-dependent. The foundation of this analysis method is the proper time-dependent constitutive models. A time-dependent constitutive model was developed for concrete creep using basic Kelvin-Voigt rheological models, modified to include time-dependent parameters. This new model was then calibrated against currently accepted creep models in order to optimize model parameters for a specific girder concrete. For the time-dependent strand relaxation model, the model proposed by Bazant and Yu (2012) was used. Unlike the commonly used Magura model (1964) this model is capable of addressing variable stress loading. It also accounts for the key factors that affect relaxation, including temperature and variations in strain. This model was calibrated against relaxation data. Using these calibrated material constitutive models, the camber prediction algorithm was used to predict the pre-release material stresses as well as the camber history for a girder. The resulting predictions were compared with measured cambers at release and up to ten hours after release. The resulting predictions were reasonable and resulted in expected trends. The predictions also compared favorably with the AASHTO (2012) model for long-term predictions...|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Dr William Brown (16 September 1928 - 16 March 2005). Brown was a structural engineer and bridge designer who specialised in suspension bridges. He {{was one of the}} principal designers at Freeman Fox & Partners (now Hyder Consulting) from 1956-85. Supervising engineer on the project was Dr Oleg Kerensky and the architect on site was R.E. Slater. There were several firms who constructed the bridge between 1967-71. The structural engineering was done by Freeman Fox & Partners and the steel fabrication was completed by Fairfields-Mabey. W.A.Fairhurst and Partners (now Fairhurst) designed and oversaw construction of the concrete piers and foundations. Christiani & Nielsen, Lehane Mackenzie and Shand Ltd were the contractors for the foundations and piers. The steel cable supplier was Bridon International. Force Technology were responsible for wind tunnel testing of the bridge. Steel was used to construct the deck and pylons and the piers are made from concrete. The road surface is mastic asphalt and consists of a two-lane dual carriageway and cycle/footpaths on each side. It has a 305 m main span and two 110 m approach spans. The width of the road deck is 31.25 m. Pylon height is 38 m high. The total length of the bridge including approaches is 1321.87 m. The clearance of the bridge is 45 m. The weight of the steel is 11,700 tonnes. 1250 miles of galvanised wire with a breaking load of 500 tonnes were used during construction. The bridge has 15 spans in total and rests on 14 diamond shaped piers which have been designed to allow air to circulate freely around them. The deck and piers have been designed to flex with temperature changes. In the event of the bridge traffic numbers increasing the cycle tracks can be configured to include a third lane. There are 4 water mains pipes and 2 gas pipes running the full length of the underside of the bridge. It is the only bridge in Scotland with single cables over central main supports and was in this respect a precursor of the Millau Viaduct in France. At the time of building it was the longest bridge of its type in the world. The bridge cost including approaches was £10.5million. HRH Princess Anne opened the bridge on 2 July 1971. The ceremonial plaque of the opening can be seen on the railings of the western footpath, at the centre of the main span. Whilst the bridge was being constructed, the West Gate Bridge in Australia also designed by Freeman Fox & Partners, collapsed. An investigation published on 14 July 1971 found faults in the design. The reason for collapse was a difference in <b>camber</b> between 2 <b>girders</b> on the west span. The Erskine Bridge had already opened but needed further stiffening to meet new standards established due to the collapse of the West Gate Bridge.|$|R
