40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that Insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> {{is involved in the}} development, growth and maintenance of the central nervous system possibly interacting with other trophic factors. High levels of insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> have been detected in the cerebellum during development and adulthood suggesting a specific role for insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> in this brain area. While there is ever increasing data regarding the cell types containing endogenous insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> in the rat brain, no information on the human brain is yet available. In the present study we sought to analyse the precise location of insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> peptide in the adult human cerebellum using a specific antiserum against recombinant human insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I.</b> After immunocytochemistry, numerous Purkinje cells exhibited intense positive staining occupying the cell soma, dendrites and dendritic spines as well as axons. Occasionally, immunoreactive Purkinje cell axons were arciform and exhibited bulbous dilatations along their proximal length. Putative recurrent collaterals of Purkinje cell axons were also insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> reactive. Double- staining immunocytochemistry in the same sections consistently showed, as expected, co-expression of insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> and calbindin, although a few calbindin containing Purkinje cells lacked insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> immunostaining suggesting there are insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> positive Purkinje cell subsets in the human cerebellum. In addition, co- expression of insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> and low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor-immunoreactive protein was found in a subpopulation of insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> positive Purkinje cells. The results of this study prove the presence of insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> immunoreactivity in a Purkinje cell subpopulation of the adult human cerebellum suggesting that insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> may participate in paracrine or autocrine regulatory systems in the adult human brain.

In adult brain, both estrogen and insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> have co-ordinated effects in the regulation of neuroendocrine events, synaptic plasticity and neural response to injury. In this study we have qualitatively assessed whether estrogen receptors and insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> receptor are colocalized in the same cells in the preoptic area, hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebral cortex and cerebellum of female rat brain using confocal microscopy. Immunoreactivity for estrogen receptors α and β was colocalized with immunoreactivity for insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> receptor in many neurons from the preoptic area, hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Furthermore, estrogen receptor β and insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> receptor immunoreactivities were colocalized in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Colocalization of estrogen receptor β and insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> receptor was also detected in cells with the morphology of astrocytes in all regions assessed. The co-expression of estrogen receptors and insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> receptor in the same neurons may allow a cross-coupling of their signaling pathways. Furthermore, the colocalization of immunoreactivity for estrogen receptor β and insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> receptor in glial cells suggests that glia may also {{play a role in the}} interactions of insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> and estrogen in the rat brain.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to find, purify and {{identify}} an urotensin-II converting enzyme (UCE) in human plasma. The MES-system (mass spectrometry assisted enzyme-screening system) was used for the detection of the UCE activity. In a homogeneous fraction, which was obtained after four chromatographic purification steps, the protease complement <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> was identified. The identity was verified by detecting urotensin-II generating activity in a commercial complement <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> fraction. Furthermore it was shown that the purified active fraction hydrolyzed a typical complement <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> substrate. Both, the purified fraction and the complement <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> fraction, showed identical substrate specificity. The purified fraction and the complement <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> fraction both were inhibited by aprotinin and pefabloc SC, two serine protease inhibitors. Both the UCE and the complement <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> fraction have N-linked oligosaccharide type polysaccharide chains. The molecular weight of UCE is identical with the complement <b>factor</b> <b>I.</b> Urotensin-II (UII) seems to be an important factor in inflammation.

40|$|SUMMARY: A {{serological}} comparison on gel-diffusion {{plates of}} purified preparations of <b>factors</b> <b>I</b> and I 1 of the anthrax toxin obtained in vitro and in Wive indicated {{that all but}} one (<b>factor</b> <b>I</b> from in Witro sources) of these preparations contained at least two major serological components. At least three serological components {{were involved in the}} total system: A (associated with <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> activity); B (associated with <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> 1 activity); C (not associated with toxic activity). These results indi-cated that no preparation of <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> 1 of the anthrax toxin so far examined was immunologically homogeneous and that the serological connexion between <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> of the anthrax toxin (produced in wivo) and the protective factor produced in Witro (Smith, 1958) was due to a common component not associated with <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> activity. There was some evidence that the method of measuring immunogenicity in certain culture filtrates of BacilZus u n t h r d by serological precipitation (Thorne & Belton, 1957) is not generally applicable to all products of this organism. In the previous paper (Stanley, Sargeant & Smith, 1960) the purification of <b>factors</b> <b>I</b> and I 1 of the anthrax toxin from the plasma of guinea-pigs dying of anthrax was described. The <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> preparation contained a small amount of guinea-pig plasma constituents and the <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> 1 preparation was largely guinea-pig a-globulin. An immunogenic preparation from Badlu 8 anthmcw was first produced in vitro in a defined medium by Wright, Hedberg & Slein (1954) and later in a partially-defined medium by Belton & Strange (1954). Smith, Keppie & Stanley (1955) showed that this non-toxic preparation was serologically related to anthrax toxin; later Smith et aZ. (1956) showed that partially purified material (Strange & Belton, 1954) had <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> 1 activity.

Both factor H and <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> interacted with both chains of C 3 (NH 3) in ligand blotting. Binding reactions between all three pairs of components were highly dependent on ionic strength, and showed similar pH optima. Binding assays with all three components present led to the following conclusions. (a) Binding sites for C 3 (NH 3) and <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> on <b>factor</b> H do not overlap, and binding of <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> and C 3 (NH 3) to soluble factor H promotes the weak factor I-C 3 (NH 3) interaction.

Although {{it has been suggested}} that insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> is involved in a variety of cellular responses leading to homeostasis, mechanisms involved in its possible trophic effects are largely unknown. Since activation of c-Fos in postmitotic neurons takes place both in response to insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> and after brain injury, we have investigated whether this early response gene may be involved in the actions of insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> after brain insult. Partial deafferentation of the cerebellar cortex by 3 -acetylpyridine injection elicited c-Fos protein expression on both Purkinje and granule cells of the cerebellar cortex. This neurotoxic insult also triggered gliosis, as determined by an increased number of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells (reactive astrocytes) in the cerebellar cortex. When 3 -acetylpyridine-injected animals received a continuous intracerebellar infusion of either a peptidic insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> receptor antagonist or an insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> antisense oligonucleotide for two weeks through an osmotic minipump, c-Fos expression was obliterated while reactive gliosis was greatly increased.

Recently we found that insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> from the inferior olive is necessary for motor learning processes probably involving Purkinje cell synaptic plasticity. We now studied whether inferior olive insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> influences the synaptic structure of Purkinje cells, because changes in synaptic morphology are related to neuronal plasticity events. We injected an insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> antisense in the inferior olive of adult rats, a procedure which we previously found to elicit a significant and reversible decrease of insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> levels in the contralateral cerebellum. Ultrastructural analysis of the cerebellar cortex of these animals showed {{a significant reduction in}} the size of dendritic spines on Purkinje cells of antisense-treated rats compared to controls.

This reduction was not due to a change in the thickness of the molecular layer. Climbing or parallel fiber terminals were also unaffected.

Between groups {{there was no difference in}} age (low versus high: 65. 3 ± 12. 1 versus 61. 6 ± 9. 1 years, p = 0. 21), body mass index, aerobic capacity (peak oxygen consumption: low versus high: 15. 5 ± 5. 2 versus 17. 3 ± 6. 3 mL/kg/min, p = 0. 23), left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association classification. Results. During quadriceps strength testing, patients with low insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> had reduced absolute strength (− 24 %), and strength per unit area muscle (− 14 %) than patients with normal/high insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I.</b> Leg muscle cross-sectional area was lower in the low insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> group (− 12 % and − 13 % for right and left legs, respectively). These alterations were accompanied by increased levels of growth hormone (+ 145 %), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (+ 46 %), cortisol/dehydroepiandrosterone ratio (+ 60 %), noradrenaline (+ 49 %) and adrenaline (+ 136 %) (all at least p < 0. 05). Conclusions. Patients with low insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> levels show signs of altered body composition, cytokine and neuroendocrine activation, to a greater extent than patients with normal/high levels...|$|R
40|$|<b>Factor</b> <b>I</b> is {{a typical}} multidomain protein of the {{complement}} system. It regulates complement activation by proteolytic degradation of C 3 b or C 4 b {{in the presence of}} factor H, complement receptor type 1, membrane cofactor protein or C 4 b-binding protein as cofactor. It is constructed from five presumed independently folded domains, namely a <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> module, a CD 5 -like domain, two low-density-lipoprotein receptor type A domains and a serine-proteinase domain. X-ray and neutron solution scattering was used to study the arrangement of these domains in <b>factor</b> <b>I.</b> <b>Factor</b> <b>I</b> was determined to be monomeric in solution, with an A 280 (1 %, 1 cm) of 12. 3 - 14. 1. Its radius of gyration (RG) was 3. 96 nm by X-rays in a high positive solute-solvent contrast, and 3. 84 nm by neutrons at infinite solute-solvent contrast. The cross-sectional radius of gyration (RXS) was likewise found to be 1. 64 nm by X-rays and 1. 55 nm by neutrons. The RG data were not noticeably dependent on the solute-solvent contrast, whereas the RXS data showed a small dependence. The maximum dimension of <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> was determined to be 12. 8 nm from the RG and RXS data, and 14 - 15 nm from the X-ray and neutron distance distribution functions. This length is too short to account for a linear arrangement of the domains in <b>factor</b> <b>I.</b> Small sphere models were developed for <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> in which the largest domain was modelled from the crystal structure for beta-trypsin. The attachment of either an elliptical cylinder or a two-armed V-shaped structure to this domain to represent the remaining four small domains gave good scattering curve-fits for <b>factor</b> <b>I,</b> and were compatible with experimental sedimentation coefficients. The non-extended domain models for <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> imply that the steric accessibility of each domain will be reduced, and this may be important for its functional activity...|$|R
40|$|Background: The insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> {{possesses}} biologic {{actions that}} {{resemble those of}} insulin. Tissue access of the factor depends {{on the distribution of}} the circulating bound factor between its binding protein 3 that remains within the intravascular space and its binding protein I that is able to cross the endothelium. Preliminary results have shown that tissue availability of insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> is a determinant of glucose regulation in essential hypertension 	 Objective: To investigate whether the tissue availability of circulating insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> in patients with essential hypertension is related to insulin resistance and whether chronic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition influences tissue availability of the factor and insulin resistance in these patients. 	 Design and methods: We studied 29 patients with essential hypertension and 20 age-matched and sex-matched normotensive subjects. The measurements were repeated for 25 patients after 12 months of treatment with lisinopril. Tissue availability of circulating insulin-like growth <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> was assessed by analyzing its distribution between its binding proteins 3 and 1. An insulin resistance index was estimated using the homeostasis model analysis of fasting insulin–glucose interactions.

40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{quantitative}} nitrocellulose filter-binding assay is described {{for the detection}} of nuclear <b>factor</b> <b>I,</b> a HeLa cell sequence-specific DNA-binding protein required for the initiation of adenovirus DNA replication. In this assay, the abundant nonspecific DNA-binding activity present in unfractionated HeLa nuclear extracts was greatly reduced by preincubation of these extracts with a homopolymeric competitor DNA. Subsequently, specific DNA-binding activity was detected as the preferential retention of a labeled 48 -base-pair DNA fragment containing a functional nuclear <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> binding site compared with a control DNA fragment to which nuclear <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> did not bind specifically. This specific DNA-binding activity was shown to be both quantitative and time dependent. Furthermore, the conditions of this assay allowed footprinting of nuclear <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> in unfractionated HeLa nuclear extracts and quantitative detection of the protein during purification. Using unfrozen HeLa cells and reagents known to limit endogenous proteolysis, nuclear <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> was purified to near homogeneity from HeLa nuclear extracts by a combination of standard chromatography and specific DNA affinity chromatography. Over a 400 -fold purification of nuclear <b>factor</b> <b>I,</b> {{on the basis of the}} specific activity of both sequence-specific DNA binding and complementation of adenovirus DNA replication in vitro, was affected by this purification. The most highly purified fraction was greatly enriched for a polypeptide of 160 kilodaltons on silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Furthermore, this protein cosedimented with specific DNA-binding activity on glycerol gradients. That this fraction indeed contained nuclear <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> was demonstrated by both DNase I footprinting and its function in the initiation of adenovirus DNA replication. Finally, the stoichiometry of specific DNA binding by nuclear <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> is shown to be most consistent with 2 mol of the 160 -kilodalton polypeptide binding per mol of nuclear factor I-binding site...|$|R
40|$|The {{inflammatory}} {{kidney disease}} membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II (MPGN 2) {{is associated with}} dysregulation of the alternative pathway of complement activation. MPGN 2 {{is characterized by the}} presence of complement C 3 along the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Spontaneous activation of C 3 through the alternative pathway is regulated by 2 plasma proteins, factor H and <b>factor</b> <b>I.</b> Deficiency of either of these regulators results in uncontrolled C 3 activation, although the breakdown of activated C 3 is dependent on <b>factor</b> <b>I.</b> Deficiency of <b>factor</b> H, but not <b>factor</b> <b>I,</b> is associated with MPGN 2 in humans, pigs, and mice. To explain this discordance, mice with single or combined deficiencies of these factors were studied. MPGN 2 did not develop in mice with combined <b>factor</b> H and <b>I</b> deficiency or in mice deficient in <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> alone. However, administration of a source of <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> to mice with combined factor H and <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> deficiency triggered both activated C 3 fragments in plasma and GBM C 3 deposition. Mouse renal transplant studies demonstrated that C 3 deposited along the GBM was derived from plasma. Together, these findings provide what we believe to be the first evidence that factor I–mediated generation of activated C 3 fragments in the circulation is a critical determinant for the development of MPGN 2 associated with factor H deficiency...|$|R

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental and behavioural syndromes affecting social orientation, behaviour, and communication that can be classified as developmental disorders. ASD is also associated with immune system abnormality. Im-mune system abnormalities may be caused partly by complement system <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> deficiency.

In this paper, we show that the mean level of <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> activity in the ASD group is significantly higher than in the control group of typically de-veloped and healthy children, suggesting that high activity of complement <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> might {{have an impact on the}} development of ASD. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{template}} {{requirements for}} efficient adenovirus DNA replication were studied in vitro in a reconstituted system with cloned DNA fragments, containing the Ad 2 origin region, as templates. Replication {{is enhanced by}} nuclear <b>factor</b> <b>I,</b> a cellular protein that binds specifically to the Ad 2 origin. This stimulation is shown to be strongly dependent on the concentration of the adenovirus DNA binding protein. Using synthetic oligonucleotides we have constructed plasmids with base substitutions in the nuclear <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> binding region.

In vitro initiation and DNA chain elongation experiments with the mutants demonstrate that binding of nuclear <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> to the Ad 2 origin is necessary for stimulation.

40|$|Nuclear <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> is a 47 -kd protein, {{isolated}} from nuclei of HeLa cells, that binds {{specifically to the}} inverted terminal repeat of the adenovirus (Ad) DNA and enhances Ad DNA replication in vitro. We have studied the DNA sequence specificity of nuclear <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> binding using cloned terminal fragments of the Ad 2 genome {{and a set of}} deletion mutants. Binding of nuclear <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> protects nucleotides 19 - 42 of Ad 2 DNA against DNase I digestion. Filter binding assays show that deletion of the first 23 nucleotides does not impair binding while a deletion of 24 nucleotides reduces binding severely. However, binding studies on Ad 12 DNA indicate that nucleotide 24 can be mutated. Fragments containing the first 40 bp are bound normally while the first 38 bp are insufficient to sustain binding. Taken together, these results indicate that the minimal recognition site of nuclear <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> contains 15 or 16 nucleotides, located from nucleotide 25 to nucleotide 39 or 40 of the Ad 2 DNA. This site contains two of the four conserved nucleotide sequences in this region. Sequences flanking the minimal recognition site may reduce the binding affinity of nuclear <b>factor</b> <b>I.</b> In accordance with these binding studies, DNA replication of a fragment that carries the sequence of the terminal 40 nucleotides of Ad 2 at one molecular end is enhanced by nuclear <b>factor</b> <b>I</b> in an in vitro replication system...|$|R
