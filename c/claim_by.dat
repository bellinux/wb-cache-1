5|$|According to James, Anne {{wrote to}} him in 1696 {{requesting}} his permission to succeed William, and thereafter promising to restore the Crown to James's line at a convenient opportunity; he declined to give his consent.

5|$|The {{issue of}} control over the {{northern}} branch of the Silk Road by the Caliphate has been suggested as a further motive for the conflict, but G. Mako disputes this <b>claim</b> <b>by</b> pointing out that warfare declined at precisely the period of the greatest expansion of traffic along the Silk Road, i.e. after the middle of the 8th century.|$|E
5|$|An {{argument}} has been advanced that Gediminas had two wives, one pagan and another Orthodox. This case is supported {{only by the}} Jüngere Hochmeisterchronik, a late 15th-century chronicle, mentioning Narimantas as half-brother to Algirdas. Other historians support this <b>claim</b> <b>by</b> arguing this would explain Gediminas' otherwise mysterious designation of a middle son, Jaunutis, as his succession would be understandable if Jaunutis were the first-born son of Gediminas and a second wife.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle {{camouflage}}, {{also known}} as razzle dazzle (in the U.S.) or dazzle painting, was a family of ship camouflage used extensively in World War I, {{and to a lesser}} extent in World War II and afterwards. Credited to the British marine artist Norman Wilkinson, though with a rejected prior <b>claim</b> <b>by</b> the zoologist John Graham Kerr, it consisted of complex patterns of geometric shapes in contrasting colours, interrupting and intersecting each other.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of war against Mexico in May 1845 and especially after the <b>claim</b> <b>by</b> the US of southwest lands under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, US military incursions into Yavapai territory greatly increased. After gold was discovered in California in 1849, more White emigrants passed through Yavapai territory than ever had before. Despite the thousands of emigrants passing through their territory, the Yavapai avoided contact with Whites.|$|E
5|$|Footage of the Fairchild {{crash was}} used in the making of the 2015 film Project Almanac, {{depicting}} an airline accident, which sparked public anger among relatives of Wolff and McGeehan. After an initial <b>claim</b> <b>by</b> Paramount Pictures that the video in question was of a 2009 Tokyo crash, producer Michael Bay issued an apology to the families, and the footage was removed from the film's theatrical release and associated trailers at Bay's request.|$|E
5|$|In late August 2014, {{a series}} of {{allegedly}} leaked photos and videos of the 3DS version were uploaded to the Internet, revealing at the time several unannounced fighters.

5|$|Most {{members of}} the Eskaya {{community}} inhabit a mountainous area that intersects the municipalities of Duero, Guindulman, Pilar, and Sierra Bullones in the once-forested region of Bohol's southeast interior. The original Eskaya settlement in Biabas (Guindulman), was established in 1902. In 1951, the second township of Taytay (municipality of Duero) was founded by Fabian Baja in accordance with Datahan's directions. Significant Eskaya populations are now {{also found in the}} nearby townships of Canta-ub, Lundag, Tambongan, Cadapdapan, and Fatimah. In 1996, the Eskaya community was awarded a certificate of Ancestral Domain <b>Claim</b> <b>by</b> President Fidel Ramos.|$|E
5|$|On 25 December 1826, the New South Wales colonial {{government}} brig Amity, {{under the command}} of Major Edmund Lockyer, arrived at King George Sound to establish a military garrison. On 21 January 1827, as instructed by the Colonial Secretary, the Union Jack was raised and a feu de joie fired by the troops, formally annexing the territory, in assertion of the first official <b>claim</b> <b>by</b> the Imperial Government to British possession over the whole continent of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Another {{story of}} the poem's origin claimed that Helmer's funeral was held {{on the morning of}} May 2, after which McCrae wrote the poem in 20 minutes. A third <b>claim,</b> <b>by</b> Morrison, was that McCrae worked on the poem as time allowed between arrivals of wounded {{soldiers}} in need of medical attention. Regardless of its true origin, McCrae worked on the poem for months before considering it ready for publication. He submitted it to The Spectator in London but it was rejected. It was then sent to Punch, where it was published on December 8, 1915. It was published anonymously, but Punch attributed the poem to McCrae in its year-end index.|$|E

5|$|Báthory's {{position}} {{was at first}} extremely difficult, as there was still some opposition to his election. Emperor Maximilian, insisting on his earlier election, fostered internal opposition and prepared to enforce his <b>claim</b> <b>by</b> military action. At first {{the representatives of the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania refused to recognize Báthory as Grand Duke, and demanded concessions - that he return the estates of his wife Anne to the Lithuanian treasury, hold Sejm conventions in both Lithuania and Poland, and reserve the highest governmental official offices in Lithuania for Lithuanians. He accepted the conditions. In June Báthory was recognized as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Duke of Ruthenia and Samogitia.|$|E
5|$|From March to September 1937, Lützow, now an Oberleutnant (first lieutenant), claimed five victories, {{including}} the first ever recorded <b>claim</b> <b>by</b> a Messerschmitt Bf 109 pilot. Flying a Bf109B, he shot down an Polikarpov I-15, a Soviet built biplane fighter aircraft, on 6 April 1937. On 26 April 1937, air elements of the Condor Legion targeted and bombed Guernica, an attack which has been characterised as a war crime by Wette and Ueberschär, but Lützow {{did not participate in}} the attack as he was on home leave from 8–29 April 1937. After he returned, Lützow claimed three more I-15s shot down, one on 22 May, another on 28 May, and his last on 18 August 1937. His final aerial victory in Spain was over a Polikarpov I-16, a monoplane fighter aircraft, which he shot down on 22 August 1937.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2012, {{legal issues}} arose when {{attempts}} were made to digitally re-release the film. G. Vijaya of Vijaya Pictures had filed a lawsuit against Gemini Colour Laboratory and Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures for attempting to re-release the film without her production company's permission. The reason for the suit was that in December 1975, Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures had transferred the entire rights of the film to Movie Film Circuit, which in turn had transferred them to Vijaya Pictures on 18 May 1976. Vijaya Pictures approached the Gemini Colour Laboratory to digitise the film for re-release, however Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures asked laboratory officials not to release the film without their prior consent. Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures also disputed Vijaya's <b>claim</b> <b>by</b> running an advertisement in a Tamil newspaper on 18 May 2012, stating that it was the owner of the film's rights and anybody who wished to exhibit it in digital format should only do so with their permission. R. Subbiah, the judge who presided over the case, ordered the status quo to be maintained by both parties.|$|E

5|$|The {{attribution}} {{of the panel}} reflects the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century scholarship on Early Netherlandish art. It is now {{thought to have been}} completed c. 1438–40, but there are still arguments for dates as early as 1424–29. As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in the Turin-Milan Hours manuscript, the panel was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck in the 1875 Gemäldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 <b>claim</b> <b>by</b> art historian Georges Hulin de Loo. This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works. By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.|$|E
5|$|A late 15th century legenda nova {{claimed that}} Henry {{had come to}} Sweden in the retinue of papal legate Nicholas Breakspear, the later Pope Adrian IV, and {{appointed}} as the Bishop of Uppsala by him. Even though legenda nova states 1150 as {{the year of the}} crusade, it is certain from other sources that Nicholas really was in Sweden in 1153. It is not known whether this was just an inference by the writer, {{based on the fact that}} also Nicholas was an Englishman. However, there is no information about anyone called as Henry accompanying the legate in any source describing the visit, nor him appointing a new bishop in Uppsala. Another <b>claim</b> <b>by</b> legenda nova was that Henry was translated to Turku cathedral already in 1154, which certainly was false since the cathedral was built only in the 1290s. In the late 16th century, Bishop Paulus Juusten claimed that Henry had been the Bishop of Uppsala for two years before the crusade. Based on these postulates, early 20th-century historians assembled 1155 as the year of the crusade and 1156 as the year of Henry's death. Historians from different centuries have also suggested various other years from 1150 to 1158.|$|E
