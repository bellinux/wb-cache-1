5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{break with the}} Senate, Caligula faced a number of {{additional}} conspiracies against him. A <b>conspiracy</b> involving his brother-in-law was foiled in late 39.

5|$|The Indo-German {{alliance}} and the <b>conspiracy</b> were {{the target of}} a worldwide British intelligence effort, which was successful in preventing further attempts. American intelligence agencies arrested key figures {{in the aftermath of the}} Annie Larsen affair in 1917. The <b>conspiracy</b> resulted in the Lahore <b>conspiracy</b> case trials in India as well as the Hindu–German <b>Conspiracy</b> Trial—at the time the longest and most expensive trial ever held in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The <b>conspiracy</b> {{is known}} under several {{different}} names, including the 'Hindu Conspiracy', the 'Indo-German Conspiracy', the 'Ghadar conspiracy' (or 'Ghadr conspiracy'), or the 'German plot'. The term Hindu–German <b>Conspiracy</b> is {{closely associated with}} the uncovering of the Annie Larsen plot in the United States, and the ensuing trial of Indian nationalists and the staff of the German Consulate of San Francisco for violating American neutrality. The trial itself was called the Hindu–German <b>Conspiracy</b> Trial, and the <b>conspiracy</b> was reported in the media (and later studied by several historians) as Hindu–German <b>Conspiracy.</b> However, the <b>conspiracy</b> involved not only Hindus and Germans, but also substantial numbers of Muslims and Punjabi Sikhs, and strong Irish support that pre-dated German and Turkish involvement. The term Hindu was used commonly in opprobrium in America to identify Indians regardless of religion. Likewise, <b>conspiracy</b> was also a term with negative connotations. The term Hindu <b>Conspiracy</b> was used by the government to actively discredit the Indian revolutionaries at a time the United States was about to join the war against Germany.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper takes {{advantage}} and develops the fundamental Best’s ideas about fairness hierarchy and <b>conspiracies</b> in concurrent systems. Near {{to the start}} we characterize liveness {{with the notion of}} ∞-fairness. Next we show that the conspiracy-freeness problem is decidable for elementary nets and undecidable for place/transition nets. The main aim of the paper was to put places into work against <b>conspiracies.</b> We show, how marking fairness effectively fights with <b>conspiracies</b> in elementary nets. Next, we introduce the notion of covering fairness, as a tool against <b>conspiracies</b> in place/transition systems. Results of the paper say that one can ensure global fairness on a local level of executions of the systems. ...|$|R

Again, the honour suggested Nerva {{had played a}} part in uncovering the <b>conspiracy,</b> perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the Pisonian <b>conspiracy</b> under Nero. Alternatively, Domitian may have selected Nerva as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status-quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed, and the Empire could return to order.|$|E

5|$|Moshe Malul {{pleaded guilty}} to a charge of {{racketeering}} <b>conspiracy,</b> admitting to <b>conspiracy</b> to commit murder and <b>conspiracy</b> to import the drug Ecstasy to the U.S. In his plea agreement, he acknowledged {{that as part of}} the Abergil crime family, he hired members of the Vineland Boyz street gang based in North Hollywood, to kill Sami Atias in retaliation for stealing Ecstasy that belonged to the Abergil organization. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison on June 21, 2012 with credit for time served. He was also ordered to serve three years under supervised release after his release from federal prison.|$|E

At the same time, another 17 al-Qaeda members were sentenced to penalties of between six and eleven years. On February 16, 2006, the Spanish Supreme Court reduced the Abu Dahdah penalty to 12 years because it considered that his participation in the <b>conspiracy</b> was not proven.|$|E

Because Louisiana law {{considers}} seventeen-year-olds to be adults for purposes of criminal culpability, the charges for these four were unaffected by the appellate ruling overturning Bell's conviction.|$|E
