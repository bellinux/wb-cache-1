5|$|The song uses two-measure phrases that, {{aside from}} the choruses, use a i–III–IV–VI <b>chord</b> progression. The B minor <b>chord</b> is held for 1⅓ of a beat, and a {{relative}} transformation is then used to produce a second-inversion D major <b>chord,</b> which is held for 1⅔ of a beat. In the second measure, a first-inversion E major <b>chord</b> with an added ninth precedes a G major major seventh chord; the chords are held for the same durations as the previous two.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the final}} orchestral crescendo, the song ends {{with one of}} the most famous final chords in music history. Overdubbed in place of the vocal {{experiment}} from 10 February, this <b>chord</b> was added during a session at EMI's Studio Two on 22 February. Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on a harmonium, and all played an E-major <b>chord</b> simultaneously. The <b>chord</b> was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the <b>chord</b> the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.|$|E
5|$|It all {{happened}} that night. She {{told us the}} title of the song, the concept and sang us the melody. We usually have Big Jim Wright sit in on those kind of sessions to work out the chords. he wasn't there so I had to work on the <b>chord</b> myself. So I was playing and there was a part where I said 'Man, what <b>chord</b> am I supposed to do here?' and Mariah has such a good ear that she sang me the <b>chord.</b>|$|E
25|$|In blues, when <b>chords</b> {{are written}} without {{additional}} notation requesting sevenths, the <b>chords</b> are often played as dominant seventh <b>chords.</b> For example, in the progression C/F/C/C/F/F/C/C/G/F/C/G, a simple {{version of the}} 12 bar blues, chord-playing musicians will often play all of these <b>chords</b> as dominant seventh <b>chords</b> (e.g., using the <b>chords</b> C7, F7 and G7).|$|R
25|$|Two-note combinations, whether {{referred}} to as <b>chords</b> or intervals, are called dyads. <b>Chords</b> constructed of three notes of some underlying scale are described as triads. <b>Chords</b> of four notes are known as tetrads, those containing five are called pentads and those using six are hexads. Sometimes the terms trichord, tetrachord, pentachord, and hexachord are used—though these more usually refer to the pitch classes of any scale, not generally played simultaneously. <b>Chords</b> that may contain more than three notes include pedal point <b>chords,</b> dominant seventh <b>chords,</b> extended <b>chords,</b> added tone <b>chords,</b> clusters, and polychords.|$|R
50|$|The {{implementation}} of musical <b>chords</b> on guitars {{depends on the}} tuning. Since standard tuning is most commonly used, expositions of guitar <b>chords</b> emphasize the {{implementation of}} musical <b>chords</b> on guitars with standard tuning. The implementation of <b>chords</b> using particular tunings is a defining part {{of the literature on}} guitar <b>chords,</b> which is omitted in the abstract musical-theory of <b>chords</b> for all instruments.|$|R
5|$|The {{concepts}} of angle and radius were already used by ancient {{peoples of the}} first millennium BC. The Greek astronomer and astrologer Hipparchus (190–120 BC) created a table of <b>chord</b> functions giving {{the length of the}} <b>chord</b> for each angle, and there are references to his using polar coordinates in establishing stellar positions.|$|E
5|$|By late 1958, Davis {{employed}} one of {{the most}} acclaimed and profitable working bands pursuing the hard bop style. His personnel had become stable: alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, tenor saxophonist John Coltrane, pianist Bill Evans, long-serving bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Jimmy Cobb. His band played a mixture of pop standards and bebop originals by Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, and Tadd Dameron. As with all bebop-based jazz, Davis's groups improvised on the <b>chord</b> changes of a given song. Davis was one of many jazz musicians growing dissatisfied with bebop, and saw its increasingly complex <b>chord</b> changes as hindering creativity.|$|E
5|$|In {{his use of}} {{conventional}} diatonic chords, Messiaen often transcended their historically banal connotations (for example, his frequent use of the added sixth <b>chord</b> as a resolution).|$|E
25|$|Other {{extended}} <b>chords</b> follow similar rules, so {{that for}} example maj9, maj11, and maj13 contain major seventh <b>chords</b> rather than dominant seventh <b>chords,</b> while m9, m11, and m13 contain minor seventh <b>chords.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Equal-interval <b>chords</b> {{are often}} of {{indeterminate}} root and mixed-interval <b>chords</b> are also often best characterized by their interval content. [...] "Equal-interval <b>chords</b> are often altered {{to make them}} 'impure' {{as in the case}} of quartal and quintal <b>chords</b> with tritones, <b>chords</b> based on seconds with varying intervals between the seconds." ...|$|R
50|$|As their {{categorical}} name suggests, extended <b>chords</b> indeed extend seventh <b>chords</b> by stacking {{one or more}} additional third-intervals, successively constructing ninth, eleventh, {{and finally}} thirteenth chords; thirteenth <b>chords</b> contain all seven notes of the diatonic scale.In closed position, extended <b>chords</b> contain dissonant intervals or may sound supersaturated, particularly thirteenth <b>chords</b> with their seven notes. Consequently, extended <b>chords</b> are often played with the omission {{of one or more}} tones, especially the fifth and often the third, as already noted for seventh chords; similarly, eleventh <b>chords</b> often omit the ninth, and thirteenth <b>chords</b> the ninth or eleventh. Often, the third is raised an octave, mimicking its position in the root's sequence of harmonics.|$|R
5|$|Jazz {{and other}} forms of modern popular music {{generally}} feature homophonic influences, following <b>chord</b> progressions over which musicians play a melody or improvise (see melody-dominated homophony).|$|E
5|$|Kind of Blue {{is based}} entirely on modality, in {{contrast}} to Davis's earlier work with the hard bop style of jazz and its complex <b>chord</b> progression and improvisation. The entire album was composed {{as a series of}} modal sketches, in which each performer was given a set of scales that defined the parameters of their improvisation and style. This style was {{in contrast to}} more typical means of composing, such as providing musicians with a complete score or, as was more common for improvisational jazz, providing the musicians with a <b>chord</b> progression or series of harmonies.|$|E

5|$|Over the bridges, the new key is set {{fully in}} the minor mode, {{avoiding}} the Dorian inflections present in previous Harrison songs. These sections begin on an E minor <b>chord,</b> which, in Roman numeral analysis, represents a v minor in the tonic of A and an iv minor in the new key. At {{the end of each}} bridge, the return to the home key is effected via an E major <b>chord,</b> marking the only use of the expected G note in the A major scale.|$|E
5|$|The song {{is in the}} key of A major, with a main <b>chord</b> {{progression}} of E - Bm - Fm.|$|E
5|$|This is {{repeated}} until (2:32), when the drumbeat gradually fades out, {{leaving only the}} ride cymbal keeping the beat, and the guitars, which repeat a melody based around the <b>chord</b> of A major, using harmonics. At (3:11), the bass guitar joins in, followed by the drum kit, building to a gradual crescendo, eventually climaxing at (3:42) into a distortion-laden <b>chord</b> progression, using the chords F♯ minor, D major, and A major. At (3:46), a guitar solo is played over these chords. This continues until (5:09), after all instruments have faded out except for the tremolo-laden feedback of the guitar.|$|E
50|$|Turnarounds {{typically}} {{begin with}} the tonic (I) (or a tonic substitute such as iii) and end on the dominant (V7), the next section starting on the tonic (I). They may also end on II7 (which is a dominant substitute). Thus when used in a twelve bar blues pattern, the twelfth bar may end on the dominant. All of the <b>chords</b> in a turnaround may be seventh <b>chords,</b> typically dominant seventh <b>chords</b> for major <b>chords</b> and minor seventh <b>chords</b> for minor <b>chords</b> (e.g., ii7).|$|R

5|$|In Garden Rain (1974, for brass ensemble), {{the limited}} and pitch-specific {{harmonic}} vocabulary of the Japanese mouth organ, the shō (see ex. 3), and its specific timbres, are clearly emulated in Takemitsu's writing for brass instruments; even similarities of performance practice can be seen, (the players are often required to hold notes {{to the limit}} of their breath capacity). In A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden, the characteristic timbres of the shō and its chords (several of which are simultaneous soundings of traditional Japanese pentatonic scales) are emulated in the opening held chords of the wind instruments (the first <b>chord</b> is in fact an exact transposition of the shō's <b>chord,</b> Jū (i); see ex. 3); meanwhile a solo oboe is assigned a melodic line that is similarly reminiscent of the lines played by the hichiriki in gagaku ensembles.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{psychological}} {{studies have shown}} that musical <b>chords</b> primed by Western musical scale in a tonal and modal schema are perceived in a hierarchy of stability. We investigated such priming effects on auditory magnetic responses to tonic-major and submediant-minor <b>chords</b> preceded by major scales and tonic-minor and submediant-major <b>chords</b> preceded by minor scales. Musically trained subjects participated in the experiment. During MEG recordings, subjects judged perceptual stability of the <b>chords.</b> The tonic <b>chords</b> were judged to be stable, whereas the submediant <b>chords</b> were judged to be unstable. Dipole moments of N 1 m response originating in the auditory cortex were larger in the left hemisphere for the submediant <b>chords</b> than for the tonic <b>chords</b> preceded by the major but not minor scales. No difference in the N 1 m or P 2 m moment was found for the <b>chords</b> presented without preceding scales. These results suggest priming effects of the tonal schema, interacting with contextual modality, on neural activity of the auditory cortex as well as perceptual stability of the <b>chords.</b> It is inferred that modulation of the auditory cortical activity is associated with attention induced by tonal instability and modality shift, which characterize the submediant <b>chords...</b>|$|R

5|$|Pianist McCoy Tyner, {{who grew}} up close to the Powell {{brothers}} in Philadelphia, was influenced by their relatively heavy keyboard touch and their liking of percussive piano sounds.
