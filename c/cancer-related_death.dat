5|$|In 2008, {{cervical}} cancer was the third-most common cancer in women worldwide, with rates varying geographically {{from less than}} one to more than 50 cases per 100,000 women. It is {{a leading cause of}} <b>cancer-related</b> <b>death</b> in poor countries, where delayed diagnosis leading to poor outcomes is common. The introduction of routine screening has resulted in fewer cases of (and deaths from) {{cervical cancer}}, however this has mainly taken place in developed countries. Most developing countries have limited or no screening, and 85% of the global burden occurring there.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide in 2012, {{lung cancer}} {{occurred}} in 1.8 {{million people and}} resulted in 1.6 million deaths. This makes it {{the most common cause}} of <b>cancer-related</b> <b>death</b> in men and second most common in women after breast cancer. The most common age at diagnosis is 70 years. Overall, 17.4% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis, while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world.|$|E
25|$|Esophageal {{cancer is}} the eighth most {{frequently}} diagnosed cancer worldwide, and because of its poor prognosis it is the sixth {{most common cause of}} <b>cancer-related</b> <b>death.</b> It caused about 400,000 deaths in 2012, accounting for about 5% of all cancer deaths (about 456,000 new cases were diagnosed, representing about 3% of all cancers).|$|E
40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} the second leading cause of <b>cancer-related</b> <b>deaths,</b> {{claiming}} close to 50, 000 lives annually in the United States alone. Colonoscopy is an important screening tool that has contributed to a significant decline in colorectal <b>cancer-related</b> <b>deaths.</b> During colonoscopy, a tiny video camera {{at the tip of}} the endoscope generates a video signal of the internal mucosa of the human colon. The video data is displayed on a monitor for real-time diagnosis by the endoscopist.

30|$|Leukemia is a {{hematological}} malignancy {{characterized by}} malignant cells that exist {{mainly in the}} bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood. An estimated 48, 610 new cases of leukemia are diagnosed in the US every year, resulting in 23, 720 deaths. Leukemia {{is the leading cause}} of <b>cancer-related</b> <b>deaths</b> in males aged < 40  years, and the second leading cause of <b>cancer-related</b> <b>deaths</b> in females aged < 20  years (Siegel et al. 2013).|$|R
30|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is {{the second}} leading cause of <b>cancer-related</b> <b>deaths</b> in the United States and the third most common cancer both in men and in women (Siegel et al., 2013). In China, it is the fifth most common cancer and also the fifth leading cause of <b>cancer-related</b> <b>deaths.</b> In the year 2012, there were 310, 000 new CRC cases {{diagnosed}} and 150, 000 deaths caused by CRC in China, and the number is still increasing (Chen et al., 2015). Although therapeutic advances {{had been made in}} the last decades, the prognosis of advanced CRC patients remains poor (Ciombor et al., 2015).|$|R
25|$|A {{study of}} 388,000 adults ages 50 to 71 {{for nine years}} found that the highest {{consumers}} of fiber were 22% less likely to die over this period. In addition to lower risk of death from heart disease, adequate consumption of fiber-containing foods, especially grains, was also associated with reduced incidence of infectious and respiratory illnesses, and, particularly among males, reduced risk of <b>cancer-related</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2010, globally, {{approximately}} 281,500 {{people died}} of leukemia. In 2000, approximately 256,000 {{children and adults}} around the world developed a form of leukemia, and 209,000 died from it. This represents about 3% of the almost seven million deaths due to cancer that year, and about 0.35% of all deaths from any cause. Of the sixteen separate sites the body compared, leukemia was the 12th most common class of neoplastic disease, and the 11th {{most common cause of}} <b>cancer-related</b> <b>death.</b> Leukemia occurs more commonly in the developed world.|$|E
25|$|The breast implant has no {{clinical}} bearing upon lumpectomy breast-conservation {{surgery for}} women who developed breast cancer after the implantation procedure, nor does the breast implant interfere with external beam radiation treatments (XRT); moreover, the post-treatment incidence of breast-tissue fibrosis is common, and thus a consequent increased rate of capsular contracture. The study Breast Cancer Detection and Survival among Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies, reported a significant delay in the diagnoses of women who developed breast cancer after undergoing breast augmentation, when compared to breast cancer patients who had not undergone breast augmentation. The metadata study Breast Implants following Mastectomy in Women with Early-stage Breast Cancer: Prevalence and Impact on Survival (2005) reported that breast augmentation patients were statistically likelier to die from breast cancer. Although the use of implants for breast reconstruction after breast cancer mastectomy appears to have no negative effect upon the incidence of <b>cancer-related</b> <b>death,</b> women who underwent a mastectomy procedure tend to die earlier than women who underwent a lumpectomy procedure, with like diagnoses.|$|E

25|$|Many {{cases can}} be safely {{followed}} with active surveillance or watchful waiting. Other treatments may include a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy or chemotherapy. When it only occurs inside the prostate it may be curable. In those in whom the disease has spread to the bones, pain medications, bisphosphonates and targeted therapy, among others, may be useful. Outcomes depend on a person's age and other health problems {{as well as how}} aggressive and extensive the cancer is. Most people with prostate cancer do not end up dying from the disease. The 5-year survival rate in the United States is 99%. Globally it is the second most common type of cancer and the fifth leading cause of <b>cancer-related</b> <b>death</b> in men. In 2012 it occurred in 1.1 million men and caused 307,000 deaths. It was the most common cancer in males in 84 countries, occurring more commonly in the developed world. Rates have been increasing in the developing world. Detection increased significantly in the 1980s and 1990s in many areas due to increased PSA testing. Studies of males who died from unrelated causes have found prostate cancer in 30% to 70% of those over age 60.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{breast cancer}} caused 458,503 deaths {{worldwide}} (13.7% of cancer deaths in women and 6.0% of all cancer deaths {{for men and}} women together).

2500|$|The {{breast cancer}} studies [...] Cancer in the Augmented Breast: Diagnosis and Prognosis (1993) and Breast Cancer after Augmentation Mammoplasty (2001) {{of women with}} breast implant {{prostheses}} reported {{no significant differences in}} disease-stage {{at the time of the}} diagnosis of cancer; prognoses are similar in both groups of women, with augmented patients at a lower risk for subsequent cancer recurrence or death. Conversely, the use of implants for breast reconstruction after breast cancer mastectomy appears to have no negative effect upon the incidence of <b>cancer-related</b> <b>death.</b> That patients with breast implants are more often diagnosed with palpable—but not larger—tumors indicates that equal-sized tumors might be more readily palpated in augmented patients, which might compensate for the impaired mammogram images. The ready palpability of the breast-cancer tumor(s) is consequent to breast tissue thinning by compression, innately in smaller breasts a priori (because they have lesser tissue volumes), and that the implant serves as a radio-opaque base against which a cancerous tumor can be differentiated.|$|E

30|$|The {{treatment}} of primary tumors is often successful, while metastatic disease still poses a considerable challenge. The {{vast majority of}} <b>cancer-related</b> <b>deaths</b> are the direct or indirect effect of distant metastases [1].
