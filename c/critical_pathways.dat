Studies have shown that significant variation exists among institutions with respect to antibacterial costs and length of stay (LOS) for CAP. These variations {{do not appear to}} be associated with significant differences in patient outcomes. This information has stimulated the development of practice guidelines and <b>critical</b> <b>pathways</b> to optimise the care of patients with CAP. The central focus of guidelines is recommendations for antibacterial therapy; <b>critical</b> <b>pathways</b> include recommendations for therapy, but focus on the process of care for patients with CAP. Guidelines and <b>critical</b> <b>pathways</b> are time consuming to develop and their implementation requires significant institutional resources. Therefore, it is essential that they are shown to be effective, and there has been significant interest in determining if guidelines and pathways can improve the cost effectiveness of care. In the past several years, a number of studies have evaluated the impact of treatment consistent with guidelines on outcomes for patients with CAP. These studies have shown that antibacterial therapy that is consistent with guidelines can reduce LOS, decrease costs, and several have shown a favourable impact on mortality.

40|$|Abstract Background Studies on {{critical}} pathway use have demonstrated decreased {{length of stay}} and cost without compromise in quality of care. However, pathway effectiveness {{is difficult to determine}} given methodological flaws, such as small or single center cohorts. We studied the effect of <b>critical</b> <b>pathways</b> on total knee replacement outcomes in a large population-based study. Methods We identified hospitals in four US states that performed total knee replacements. We sent a questionnaire to surgical administrators in these hospitals including items about critical pathway use and hospital characteristics potentially related to outcomes. Patient data were obtained from Medicare claims, including demographics, comorbidities, 90 -day postoperative complications and length of hospital stay. The principal outcome measure was the risk of having one or more postoperative complications. Results Two hundred ninety five hospitals (73 %) responded to the questionnaire, with 201 reporting the use of <b>critical</b> <b>pathways.</b> 9, 157 Medicare beneficiaries underwent TKR in these hospitals {{with a mean age of}} 74 years (± 5. 8). After adjusting for both patient and hospital related variables, patients in hospitals with pathways were 32 % less likely to have a postoperative complication compared to patients in hospitals without pathways (OR 0. 68, 95 % CI 0. 50 - 0. 92). Patients managed on a critical pathway had an average length of stay 0. 5 days (95 % CI 0. 3 - 0. 6) shorter than patients not managed on a pathway. Conclusion Medicare patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery in hospitals that used <b>critical</b> <b>pathways</b> had fewer postoperative complications than patients in hospitals without pathways, even after adjusting for patient and hospital related factors. This study has helped to establish that critical pathway use is associated with lower rates of postoperative mortality and complications following total knee replacement after adjusting for measured variables. </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurpose: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} a <b>critical</b> <b>pathway</b> on postoperative length of stay and outcomes after infrainguinal bypass. Methods: A <b>critical</b> <b>pathway</b> for care of patients after infrainguinal bypass was introduced in December 1995 to coordinate postoperative care at our institution. We compared care of 67 consecutively treated patients before institution of the pathway with care of 69 consecutively treated patients with the <b>critical</b> <b>pathway</b> in place. Data collection was done by means of chart review. Univariate analyses were used to identify differences between prepathway and postpathway patients and to identify factors influencing postoperative length of stay. Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors that influenced length of stay and to examine the effect of use of the pathway after adjusting for other factors. Results: Patients on the pathway were similar to prepathway controls with respect to comorbid illnesses, vascular risk factors, indications for surgical treatment, type of conduit, and type of operation. Factors associated with longer postoperative stays included distal anastomoses to tibial rather than popliteal vessels (p = 0. 02), preexisting cardiac disease (p = 0. 005), postoperative complications (p = 0. 0003), lower preoperative hematocrit (p = 0. 01), and elevated preoperative creatinine level (p = 0. 006). Overall, pathway patients had somewhat shorter postoperative lengths of stay (median value 7 days; range 2 to 29 days) than prepathway patients (median value 6 days; range 2 to 35; p = 0. 01), and the two groups had similar frequencies of postoperative complications, readmission, and 6 -month mortality. However, patients on the pathway {{were more likely to be}} discharged to an intermediate-care facility rather than directly home. After 12 patients with extraordinarily prolonged postoperative stays were excluded, multivariate analysis indicated that pathway patients had significantly shorter postoperative stays (p = 0. 001). However, the difference was not significant if patients with extraordinarily long postoperative stays were included in the analysis (p = 0. 28). Conclusion: Use of a <b>critical</b> <b>pathway</b> was associated with a modest decrease in postoperative length of stay for most patients. This was accomplished without an adverse effect on readmission, complication, or mortality rates. However, the decrease in stay may have been achieved primarily by discharging more patients to intermediate-care facilities. The pathway did not appear to have any effect when the subset of patients with extraordinarily long stays because of complex medical problems was included. (J Vasc Surg 1998; 27 : 1056 - 65. ...|$|R
