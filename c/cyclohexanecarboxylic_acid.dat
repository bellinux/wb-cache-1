The cloned gene, with a proposed designation of chcA, encodes an 843 -bp open reading frame which predicts a primary translation product of 280 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 29. 7 kDa. Highly significant sequence similiarity extending along almost the entire length of the protein was observed with members of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase superfamily. The S. collinus chcA gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli by using a bacteriophage T 7 transient expression system, and a protein with a specific ChcA activity was detected. The E. coli-produced ChcA protein was purified and shown to have similar steady-state kinetics and electrophoretic mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels as the enoyl-coenzyme A reductase protein prepared from S. collinus.

Thesis supervisor: Dr. Todd Schachtman. [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors are known to mediate learning and memory. Although evidence indicates a role for mGlu receptors (e. g., mGlu 5) in conditioned taste aversion (CTA), a complete understanding of the subtype-specific involvement of mGlu receptors in this associative learning task remains to be determined. The current study {{examined the effects of}} (1 R, 4 R, 5 S, 6 R) - 4 -Amino- 2 - oxabicyclo[3. 1. 0]hexane- 4, 6 -dicarboxylic acid (LY 379268), a selective group II mGlu receptor agonist, and cis- 2 -(3, 5 -Dichlorophenylcarbamoyl) <b>cyclohexanecarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> (VU 0155041), a mGlu 4 receptor selective positive allosteric modulator, on the acquisition of CTA using male Sprague-Dawley rats. It was found that systemic injections of LY 379268 prior to the conditioning trial decreased the acquisition of CTA on later test trials, while injections of VU 0155041 prior to the conditioning trial had no effect on the acquisition of CTA.

40|$|Anaerobic {{naphthalene}} degradation by a sulfate-reducing {{enrichment culture}} was studied by substrate utilization tests and identification of metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In substrate utilization tests, the culture {{was able to}} oxidize naphthalene, 2 -methylnaphthalene, 1 - and 2 -naphthoic acids, phenylacetic acid, benzoic acid, <b>cyclohexanecarboxylic</b> <b>acid,</b> and cyclohex- 1 -ene-carboxylic acid with sulfate as the electron acceptor. Neither hydroxylated 1 - or 2 -naphthoic acid derivatives and 1 - or 2 -naphthol nor the monoaromatic compounds ortho-phthalic acid, 2 -carboxy- 1 -phenylacetic acid, and salicylic acid were utilized by the culture within 100 days. 2 -Naphthoic acid accumulated in all naphthalene-grown cultures. Reduced 2 -naphthoic acid derivatives could be identified by comparison of mass spectra and coelution with commercial reference compounds such as 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro- 2 -naphthoic acid and chemically synthesized decahydro- 2 -naphthoic acid. 5, 6, 7, 8 -Tetrahydro- 2 -naphthoic acid and octahydro- 2 -naphthoic acid were tentatively identified by their mass spectra. The metabolites identified suggest a stepwise reduction of the aromatic ring system before ring cleavage. In degradation experiments with [1 - 13 C]naphthalene or deuterated D 8 -naphthalene, all metabolites mentioned derived from the introduced labeled naphthalene. When a [13 C]bicarbonate-buffered growth medium was {{used in conjunction with}} unlabeled naphthalene, 13 C incorporation into the carboxylic group of 2 -naphthoic acid was shown, indicating that activation of naphthalene by carboxylation was the initial degradation step. No ring fission products were identified...|$|E
40|$|The vicinal proton−proton {{couplings}} of the dipolar form of β-alanine in water, alcohol−water, and dimethyl sulfoxide−water solutions indicate little conformational {{preference and}} {{are consistent with}} an essentially statistical equilibrium of the gauche or trans conformations. The position of the equilibrium is only slightly affected, over a temperature range of about 130 °, by changes in dielectric constants ranging from 30 to 80 or by massive changes in ionic strength. Quantum-mechanical calculations at the HF/ 6 - 31 G^(**) and LMP 2 /cc-pVTZ levels were found to give rather good parallels with experiment, although suggesting the gauche conformation to be 2 − 3 kcal/mol more stable in water or methanol than actually observed. A number of related compounds, such as N,N,N-trimethyl-β-alanine and N,N-diethyl-β-alanine, {{as well as the}} conjugate acid and conjugate base of β-alanine, also show no significant conformational preference in water solution. In conformity with these results, the zwitterionic form of piperidine- 3 -carboxylic acid (nipecotic acid) has about the same preference for equatorial carboxylate as <b>cyclohexanecarboxylic</b> <b>acid</b> itself. Taurine shows no significant conformational preference except in basic solution, where the couplings indicate about 53 % of the gauche conformation. In contrast, N,N,N-trimethyltaurine is predominantly trans in acidic or neutral solution. The conformational equilibria of the N,N,N-trimethyltaurine species are most likely governed by steric hindrance, because there are rather large tetrahedral groups {{at each end of the}} ethano chains. Yet, even here the energy difference between gauche and trans is only about 1. 2 kcal...|$|E
