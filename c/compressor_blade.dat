At low flow rates the incidence angle or angle of attack increases and due to this there occurs the flow separation on the suction side of the blades which is known as positive stalling.

But generally positive stalling is taken into consideration.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the potential of}} aeroelastic tailoring to improve flutter stability of carbon fiber turbomachinery <b>compressor</b> <b>blades</b> the structural dynamic and aeroelastic behavior of ten different laminate layups were compared. At first an operating point at off-design conditions was identified as flutter critical. Afterwards the dependency between Laminate properties and eigenbehavior and between eigenbehavior and aerodynamic stability under these off-design conditions were described. The results show that for every {{of the first three}} natural oscillations certain conditions for the eigenmode and eigenfrequency have to be satisfied to evoke aerodynamically stable be- havior. Considering these constraints just one of the investigated laminates is suitable to ensure flutter stability for these certain flow conditions. This very small variety of applicable laminate layups shows the complexity to design aerodynamically stable <b>compressor</b> <b>blades</b> but also the great potential of aeroelastic tailoring to improve the flutter stability of carbon fiber turbomachinery <b>compressor</b> <b>blades...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{some cases}} in jet engines the {{conditions}} in the engine due to airflow entering the engine or other variations can cause the <b>compressor</b> <b>blades</b> to stall. When this occurs the pressure in the engine blows out past the blades, and the stall is maintained until the pressure has decreased, and the engine has lost all thrust. The <b>compressor</b> <b>blades</b> will then usually come out of stall, and re-pressurize the engine. If conditions are not corrected, the cycle will usually repeat. This is called surge. Depending on the engine this can be highly damaging to the engine and creates worrying vibrations for the crew.|$|R

5000|$|Increasing {{pressure}} ratio, as Figure 1 above shows, {{increasing the}} pressure ratio increases {{the efficiency of}} the Brayton cycle. This is analogous to the increase of efficiency seen in the Otto cycle when the compression ratio is increased. However, practical limits occur when it comes to increasing the pressure ratio. First of all, increasing the pressure ratio increases the compressor discharge temperature. This can cause the temperature of the gasses leaving the combustor to exceed the metallurgical limits of the turbine. Also, the diameter of the compressor blades becomes progressively smaller in higher pressure stages of the compressor. Because the gap between the blades and the engine casing increases in size {{as a percentage of the}} <b>compressor</b> <b>blade</b> height as the blades get smaller in diameter, a greater percentage of the compressed air can leak back past the blades in higher pressure stages. This causes a drop in compressor efficiency, and is most likely to occur in smaller gas turbines (since blades are inherently smaller to begin with). Finally, as can be seen in Figure 1, the efficiency levels off as pressure ratio increases. Hence, little gain is expected by increasing the pressure ratio further if it is already at a high level.|$|E

40|$|Surface {{degradation}} in an {{axial compressor}} during its lifetime {{can have a}} considerable adverse effect on its performance.

It is shown that including surface roughness in the optimization process is of relatively little importance, however, matching of compressor stages is shown to require consideration as the rotational speed must be increased to reach the design point as surface quality decrease. An increased surface roughness in itself is shown to have a large effect on performance. Two optimization approaches are compared. The first approach considers the <b>compressor</b> <b>blades</b> to be hydraulically smooth.
