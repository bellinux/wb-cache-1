5|$|Although the Calendar Round {{is still}} in use today, the Maya started using an {{abbreviated}} Short <b>Count</b> during the Late Classic period. The Short <b>Count</b> is a <b>count</b> of 13 k'atuns. For this reason, {{there is no direct}} correlation between the Long <b>Count</b> and the European calendar. The most generally accepted correlation is the Goodman-Martínez-Thompson, or GMT, correlation. This equates the Long <b>Count</b> date 11.16.0.0.0 13 Ajaw 8 Xul with the Gregorian date of 12 November 1539. Epigraphers Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube argue for a two-day shift from the standard GMT correlation. The Spinden Correlation would shift the Long <b>Count</b> dates back by 260 years; it also accords with the documentary evidence, and is better suited to the archaeology of the Yucatán Peninsula, but presents problems {{with the rest of the}} Maya region. The George Vaillant Correlation would shift all Maya dates 260 years later, and would greatly shorten the Postclassic period. Radiocarbon dating of dated wooden lintels at Tikal supports the GMT correlation.|$|E

Judge Powers handed down a dissenting opinion, stating that he was of the view that Berger was not responsible for the murder of Mesny.|$|E
