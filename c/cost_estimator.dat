40|$|Prediction of {{probable}} final construction cost is {{the predominant}} task of <b>cost</b> <b>estimators.</b> While majority of construction projects are procured under a fixed price nature, any errors in cost prediction could undermine the project success and ultimately reduce the profit margin. Cost estimation not only {{relies on a}} precise analysis of available data but also {{involves the use of}} subjective judgement especially in the absence of perfect data. Producing accurate cost estimation within an unrealistically short tendering period has exerted a great deal of stress on estimators. In fact, {{it is well known that}} cost estimation is a very stressful business. This paper identifies the main causes of the stress endured by <b>cost</b> <b>estimators</b> by a survey of construction <b>cost</b> <b>estimators</b> in Hong Kong. Using correlation analysis, regression analysis and structural equation modelling, the relationships amongst the stressors (stress factors) and stress are examined and a causal structural model is developed.

40|$|Predicting {{the cost}} of a new {{military}} Air System, 20 years before it is due for production, is a complex, knowledge intensive activity. The margin of error can be as much as minus 50 to over plus 100 %. A concurrent engineering (CE) environment helps to reduce this potential error by providing <b>cost</b> <b>estimators</b> with meaningful information during the early project phases. Nonetheless, it is difficult for non-cost experts to understand how a final estimate is derived, since the knowledge and experience of <b>cost</b> <b>estimators</b> is not made explicit within their cost models. As a result, cost estimating is sometimes considered a `black art', yet in reality it is not, or rather, it need not be. To address this issue, the following paper presents the use of a novel knowledge capture methodology called Knowledge = Expert [...] Novice. This methodology aids the capture of cost modelling process knowledge during the conceptual stages of new product design, and makes the tacit knowledge of <b>cost</b> <b>estimators</b> more explicit. Furthermore, through this exercise a new cost modelling process has been identified, which it is argued, will enhance the quality and validity of future estimates...|$|R
50|$|A cost {{estimate}} is the approximation {{of the cost}} of a program, project, or operation. The {{cost estimate}} is the product of the cost estimating process. The cost estimate has a single total value and may have identifiable component values. A problem with a cost overrun can be avoided with a credible, reliable, and accurate cost estimate. A <b>cost</b> <b>estimator</b> is the professional who prepares cost estimates. There are different types of cost estimators, whose title may be preceded by a modifier, such as building estimator, or electrical estimator, or chief estimator. Other professional titles may also prepare cost estimates or contribute to cost estimates, such as quantity surveyors, cost engineers, etc. In the US, there were 185,400 cost estimators in 2010. There are around 75,000 professional quantity surveyors working in the UK.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{an ad hoc}} Floyd-A∗ algorithm to determine the a priori least-time itinerary from an origin to a destination given an initial time in an urban scheduled public transport (USPT) network. The network is bimodal (i. e., USPT lines and walking) and time dependent. The modified USPT network model results in more reasonable itinerary results. An itinerary is connected through a sequence of time-label arcs. The proposed Floyd-A∗ algorithm is composed of two procedures designated as Itinerary Finder and <b>Cost</b> <b>Estimator.</b> The A∗-based Itinerary Finder determines the time-dependent, least-time itinerary in real time, aided by the heuristic information precomputed by the Floyd-based <b>Cost</b> <b>Estimator,</b> where a strategy is formed to preestimate the time-dependent arc travel time as an associated static lower bound. The Floyd-A∗ algorithm is proven to guarantee optimality in theory and, demonstrated through a real-world example in Shenyang City USPT network to be more efficient than previous procedures. The computational experiments also reveal the time-dependent nature of the least-time itinerary.

40|$|The cost of {{products}} and services evolve during a project life cycle. During this time different cost estimates must be made {{that can be used}} as fundamental criteria for making design and manufacturing decisions. The competent completion of an estimate requires both knowledge and skills that can be obtained by providing mentoring to the <b>cost</b> <b>estimator.</b> This study has been undertaken within the Virtual Cost Engineering Studio (V-CES) European project. This project aims to provide two main resources, training for professionals in the area of Cost Engineering {{in the form of an}} ‘E-mentor’ tool and a platform where ‘e-training’ material can be deployed. The E-mentor is a ‘step by step’ tool that guides the trainee through the Cost Estimating process based on the three Cost Estimating Methodologies: Analogy, Detailed and Parametric. In such context, this thesis describes the development of an intelligent e-mentoring tool that provides both support and guidance to the trainee when using the V-CES services. The tool suggests the suitable cost estimating methodology/ies with comprehensive and useful feedback. This thesis also describes the assessment of competences required for the cost estimating process that enables the suggestion of an e-training path and the classification of a <b>cost</b> <b>estimator</b> as a novice or expert. This assessment is based on the knowledge and skills required for each identified competence. The classification of a <b>cost</b> <b>estimator</b> as a novice or expert allows the E-mentor tool to be tailored to the cost estimators needs with feedback given throughout the cost estimating process. The validation of the developed prototype has been done with cost estimating professionals using both interviews and case studies.

40|$|Cost {{estimating}} is {{a knowledge}} intensive task, involving {{a high degree}} of subjectivity. Consequently, many of the current cost estimating (CE) processes lack formalisation, often resulting in the branding of cost estimating as a “part art, part science” discipline. This thesis is concerned with understanding the factors that influence the quality of the cost estimating process. The aim is to develop a framework that will improve the perceived quality of cost estimates, by minimising the subjectivity involved the current CE process. A literature review examines the shortcomings of the current CE processes. It was identified that {{there is a lack of}} methodologies for eliciting CE knowledge, as well as mixed views across authors regarding the CE knowledge requirements. In addition, the review identifies that the current methods for assessing the quality of cost estimates are unstructured and highly subjective. By adopting a case study approach, the current CE processes across a number of organisations were captured, resulting in the identification of their weaknesses. A detailed study was carried out regarding the knowledge associated with the cost estimation of complex mechanical hardware products. This led to the development of a Knowledge Elicitation (KEL) methodology, tailored to the needs of <b>cost</b> <b>estimators.</b> Through the use of a survey study, it was identified that the quality of a cost estimate is dependent on the fulfilment of a number of inherent characteristics. It was demonstrated that there was some variation in the relative contribution of each characteristic influencing the overall quality of the estimating process. These findings were implemented in a prototype software tool, which <b>cost</b> <b>estimators</b> could use to assess and quantify the quality of their estimates. A framework was developed based on the merge of the prototype tool and the KEL methodology. The framework’s purpose is to aid <b>cost</b> <b>estimators</b> in acquiring all the necessary knowledge for developing cost estimates of good quality. Novice <b>cost</b> <b>estimators</b> will find the application of the framework particularly beneficial, since they lack the experience and knowledge in a particular domain. In conclusion, it was demonstrated through the case studies that the use of the proposed framework provides novice <b>cost</b> <b>estimators</b> with a formalised process for developing cost estimates of quality similar to the one of experts. The framework was applied on case studies within the aerospace and automotive industry, and their results were validated by experts within the collaborating organisations. As a result of this study’s findings, key areas for future research were identified. The adoption of this approach by cost practitioners could provide increased credibility to their work and a higher level of confidence in their cost estimates.
