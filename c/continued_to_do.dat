5|$|In October 1993, River Phoenix came to {{stay with}} Frusciante and the duo went on a long drug binge {{together}}, {{doing a lot of}} drugs and barely sleeping. According to Bob Forrest, the two arrived at The Viper Room together on October 31, 1993 and <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> drugs.

5|$|Watford fans {{maintain}} a rivalry {{with those of}} Luton Town. The two sides met regularly in the Southern League between 1900 and 1920, and <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in The Football League until 1937, when Luton gained promotion from Division Three South. Luton remained in a higher division than Watford until 1963.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{initiative}} {{came from}} Norman Pierre Gentieu (1914–2009), an American writer who discovered Sorabji by reading his book Around Music {{just after the}} Second World War. Because of the post-war shortages in England, Gentieu sent Sorabji some provisions, {{and the depth of}} their friendship appears to have been such that he <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so for the next four decades. In the early 1950s Gentieu made an offer to Sorabji to pay for the microfilming of his major piano works and to give some copies to selected libraries. All of his unpublished musical manuscripts were eventually microfilmed. Gentieu also sent Sorabji a tape recorder to record some of his music, but Sorabji did not do so.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing the}} tag team title, Morrison and The Miz entered a feud with ECW {{newcomers}} Evan Bourne and Ricky Ortiz, who {{they had previously}} mocked (and <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so) on the Dirt Sheet. They also had an Internet-centered feud with Raws Cryme Tyme (Shad Gaspard and JTG) based on which WWE.com online show was better: the Dirt Sheet or Cryme Tyme's Word Up. Morrison and The Miz won a match between the two teams at Cyber Sunday, which was voted for by fans over a World Tag Team Championship match.|$|E

5|$|After the incident, {{the event}} was halted for 15 minutes, until Vince McMahon and other WWF Corporate {{officials}} {{made the decision to}} continue the event. Hart's coworkers, professional wrestlers, and other miscellaneous workers, appeared somber after Hart's fall as they <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> their jobs. An hour after the event restarted, Ross informed pay-per-view viewers that Hart had {{died at the age of}} 34 at a nearby hospital. The fans in attendance were not told any information about what had happened to Hart, and they did not hear the announcement of his death.|$|E
5|$|Although the Coris were {{discouraged}} from working together at Roswell, they <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, specializing in investigating carbohydrate metabolism. They were {{particularly interested in}} how glucose is metabolized {{in the human body}} and the hormones that regulate this process. They published fifty papers while at Roswell, with first author status going to the one who had done most of the research for a given paper. Gerty Cori published eleven articles as the sole author. In 1929, they proposed the theoretical cycle that later won them the Nobel Prize, the Cori cycle.|$|E
5|$|Bethe <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{research}} on supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, {{and other problems}} in theoretical astrophysics into his late nineties. In doing this, he collaborated with Gerald E. Brown of Stony Brook University. In 1978, Brown proposed that they collaborate on supernovae. These were reasonably well understood by this time, but the calculations were still a problem. Using techniques honed from decades of working with nuclear physics, and some experience with calculations involving nuclear explosions, Bethe tackled the problems involved in stellar gravitational collapse, {{and the way in}} which various factors affected a supernova explosion. Once again, he was able to reduce the problem to a set of differential equations, and solve them.|$|E

Doug had asked the Bruins' Blair for more money for Bobby and was turned down. Doug Orr met Toronto lawyer Alan Eagleson at a juvenile fastball tournament dinner in Parry Sound and asked Eagleson to help out with the situation. Eagleson agreed {{to work with the}} family for free and <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so for the next two years. Bobby and Eagleson developed a relationship Orr would later describe as being like brothers. The two soon became a team, discussing Bobby's future plans without his father Doug.|$|E
5|$|Cena {{lost the}} {{championship}} back to Edge in a Last Man Standing match at Backlash after interference from Big Show, who chokeslammed Cena through a big spotlight. This resulted in Cena beginning a feud with Big Show in which Cena defeated Big Show at Judgment Day and at Extreme Rules in a submission match {{by applying the}} STFU. During Cena's feud with Big Show, The Miz challenged him to a match on the April 27 episode of Raw, but as Cena was out due to injury, Miz claimed an unofficial win via forfeit and <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this over the following weeks, until Cena defeated him in a singles match at The Bash.|$|E
5|$|Early games {{involved}} varying {{numbers of}} players. Games {{could also be}} played with uneven numbers on each side either because some failed to show or one side offered a handicap. The first match between Sheffield and Hallam involved 16 players versus 20. Games predominantly involved larger numbers than used in the modern games. In October 1863, Sheffield declared that it would only play 11 a side matches. Despite this it <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so on occasions. By 1867 {{the vast majority of}} matches in Sheffield involved teams of between 11 and 14.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and {{continuing}} throughout the 1980s, {{the intensity of}} Bahrain's political situation sharply increased. Al-Jamri, who was then participating in several petitions, was questioned multiple times and put under strict surveillance by the Security and Intelligence Service. In 1984, the Islamic Enlightenment institution, with which al-Jamri was associated, was closed by the government. The government also closed other places of meeting and prohibited public seminars. Al-Jamry however opened his house for daily meetings, also offering a weekly space for public debates; he <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so despite several government attempts to stop him.|$|E
5|$|The {{early stages}} of the {{organization}} were characterized by a focus on Marxist–Leninist ideology. The CPC viewed the women’s movement {{as a part of the}} larger Chinese revolution against the feudal past, but some leaders in the CPC argued that because most of the women <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> domestic work, and did not actively participate in the revolution, this contradicted the Marxist–Leninist ideology. The ACWF contested this assertion, stating that the economic conditions were not at the point where jobs could be provided to all women. Therefore, housekeepers, wives and mothers who were dedicated to their work could indeed be seen as contributing to socialism.|$|E

The film continued its successful run in the United States through early June 2014 and collected 82 million.

5|$|The {{first three}} ships to be commissioned, Tigre, Chacal, and Panthère, were {{assigned}} to the Mediterranean Squadron at Toulon, and the last three {{were assigned to}} the Second Squadron (2ème Escadre) at Brest. The ships made many port visits and participated in several naval reviews during the 1920s and early 1930s. Several even made visits to French West Africa and the French West Indies in the early 1930s. Jaguar served as the flagship of several different destroyer (torpilleur d'escadre) flotillas from 1928 to 1937. The Chacal-class ships started to become dedicated training ships beginning in 1932 and <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so until the beginning of World War II.|$|E

After another lengthy refit, the ship began escorting ships between Denmark and Norway in mid-1944 and <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so until May 1945 when she made several trips to rescue refugees from East Prussia before the end of the war on 8 May.|$|E
5|$|When on leave, Roger often {{stayed with}} his Uncle Edward at Tichborne Park and became {{attracted}} to his cousin Katherine Doughty, four years his junior.
