50|$|All of {{this can}} be {{controlled}} by one operator sitting in the cab of the vehicle. A control computer can simplify mechanical movements and can keep records of the length and diameter of trees <b>cut.</b> <b>Length</b> is computed by either counting the rotations of the gripping wheels or, more commonly, using the measuring wheel. Diameter is computed from the pivot angle of the gripping wheels or delimbing knives when hugging the tree. Length measurement also can be used for automated cutting of the tree into predefined lengths. Computer software can predict the volume of each stem based on analysing stems harvested previously. This information when used in conjunction with price lists for each specific log specification enables the optimisation of log recovery from the stem.|$|E

50|$|A second form of {{kickback}} {{may occur}} if the saw's fence is mis-adjusted, {{so as to}} be slightly closer {{to the rear of the}} blade than the front, rather than being accurately parallel. In this case the fence pushes the wood into the saw blade, leading to a similar result. This is especially likely when cross-cutting sheet materials that are wider than the <b>cut</b> <b>length.</b> These may pivot on the table and jam against the blade. If a proper cross-cutting jig is not being used, the fence should at least be adjusted (either slid forwards or a false fence added) so that the end of the fence stops alongside the blade. Beyond the cut there is thus a free space for the cut-off to pivot into, without binding.|$|E
50|$|Thicker {{hair that}} wants to readily stand upright is ideal for a crew cut; with an {{appropriate}} head shape, a crew cut may be possible with fairly thin hair. When designing a crew cut, a barber follows the general sequence of other medium to short haircuts; edging, siding and topping. When designing a new crew cut and the current style is not relatively short, the hair on top or all over the head may initially be shortened with shears or clippers. Edging and siding together form a taper which usually is short, semi-short or medium. For a crew cut, some barbers perform edging and siding as one integrated process, regardless, the upper sides are initially boxed in and then cut to final form when designing the top. The hair {{on the top of}} the head can be styled clipper or shears over comb or free hand with a clipper.With the clipper or shears over comb method, the comb is inserted in the upright hair at the desired length and the hair is reduced to this length by means of clippers or shears severing the hair above the teeth of the comb. Free hand means the clipper blade or guard does not determine the cut hair length but rather the distance the cutting blade is held above the scalp sets the <b>cut</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E
40|$|The authors {{tested the}} same chipper under two {{alternative}} <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> settings (7 mm and 20 mm), {{with and without}} a piece breaker. The study included 10 repetitions per treatment, over 2 different feedstock types: chestnut logs and locust logs. The total number of repetitions was 80, each consisting of about 30 kg of logs. <b>Cut</b> <b>length</b> setting and piece breaker option are the main drivers of chip size, and they are manipulated with {{the main purpose of}} managing particle size distribution. Our study showed that the proportion of small chips increased dramatically with the shortest <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> setting (7 mm). Installing a piece breaker allowed maximizing the incidence of small chips, which reached 70 % of the total mass when the piece breaker was used in combination with the shortest <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> setting. All else being equal, reducing <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> determined a substantial decrease of productivity (ca. 30 %), and an even higher increase of specific fuel consumption (ca. 50 %). All strategies to reduce chip size also resulted in increasing the incidence of fines. These results were obtained with new sharp blades.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In recent years, the {{propagation}} saw test (PST) gained popularity for both avalanche professionals and backcountry recreationalists. A limiting factor of the PST is the additional {{time required to}} isolate a column on the sidewall of the snowpit. Since I often have limited time to dig multiple pits during a work day, this past season I examined the effectiveness of conducting cross-slope PSTs (CPST). The CPST is simply a PST done across, rather than up, the slope. It is more efficient than the PST, particularly after conducting an extended column test (ECT). I collected a total of 28 data sets, including standard PSTs, CPSTs and ECTs during the 2013 / 14 winter season. My data indicate that CPSTs share similar critical <b>cut</b> <b>lengths</b> as standard PSTs, with 75 % of critical <b>cut</b> <b>lengths</b> falling within 10 cm of each other. Though {{it is necessary to}} collect more data to make solid conclusions, there may be a slope angle effect where CPSTs begin to have shorter <b>cut</b> <b>lengths</b> than standard PSTs as slope angles increase above 28 or 30 degrees. A drawback of the CPST is that some weak layers may be more difficult to follow than in a standard PST. Currently, the CPST cannot be qualified as a standardized stability test, but I hope to continue to collect additional data to better understand how CPSTs are related to PSTs and snowpack stability...|$|R

40|$|Fibre {{cuts were}} {{introduced}} into carbon fibre/self-reinforced polypropylene (SRPP) to achieve {{more control over}} the energy release upon fracture of the carbon fibre ply. The goal was to provide a gradual transition from the carbon fibre failure to the SRPP failure. The cuts were applied either manually or by a laser. Increasing the number of cuts for a given total <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> reduced the ultimate failure strain of the hybrid composite without a more gradual failure behaviour. Increasing the <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> increased the ultimate failure strain and yielded a more gradual transition. Nevertheless, it was found to be difficult to achieve fragmentation, or multiple fracturing of the carbon fibre plies. The extent of delaminations was strongly affected by the presence of the cuts. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|If a weak snow layer below a {{cohesive}} slab {{is present in}} the snow cover, unstable snow conditions can prevail for days or even weeks. We monitored the temporal evolution of a weak layer of faceted crystals as well as the overlaying slab layers at the location of an automatic weather station in the Steintälli field site above Davos (Eastern Swiss Alps). We focussed on the crack propagation propensity and performed propagation saw tests (PSTs) on 7 sampling days during a 2 -month period from early January to early March  2015. Based on video images taken during the tests we determined the mechanical properties of the slab and the weak layer and compared them to the results derived from concurrently performed measurements of penetration resistance using the snow micro-penetrometer (SMP). The critical <b>cut</b> <b>length,</b> observed in PSTs, increased overall during the measurement period. The increase was not steady and the lowest values of critical <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> were observed around the middle of the measurement period. The relevant mechanical properties, the slab effective elastic modulus and the weak layer specific fracture, overall increased as well. However, the changes with time differed, suggesting that the critical <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> cannot be assessed by simply monitoring a single mechanical property such as slab load, slab modulus or weak layer specific fracture energy. Instead, crack propagation propensity {{is the result of a}} complex interplay between the mechanical properties of the slab and the weak layer. We then compared our field observations to newly developed metrics of snow instability related to either failure initiation or crack propagation propensity. The metrics were either derived from the SMP signal or calculated from simulated snow stratigraphy (SNOWPACK). They partially reproduced the observed temporal evolution of critical <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> and instability test scores. Whereas our unique dataset of quantitative measures of snow instability provides new insights into the complex slab-weak layer interaction, it also showed some deficiencies of the modelled metrics of instability – calling for an improved representation of the mechanical properties...|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of the bark of rubber tree {{over a long period}} is a major concern for rubber planters in order to cope with problems of early replanting due to limited financial means. One of the efficient solutions to this concern is tapping with less longer tapping cuts. The reduction of the tapping <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> in reverse tapping permits to manage better the tapping panel, to improve the productivity of the tapper and to increase the economical life span of rubber trees. On that respect, a study was conducted during six years in south-eastern Côte d'Ivoire {{in order to determine the}} length(s) of tapping cut, in downward tapping, which would provide a suitable solution to the problem of rubber farmers. The influence of the reduction of the tapping <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> on the parameters of yield, radial vegetative growth and physiological profile is evaluated in clones GT 1 and PB 235 of Hevea brasiliensis. Half, third, quarter and eighth spiral tapping cuts were compared to each other and to a full spiral cut (control). The reduction of the tapping cuts length induces losses in rubber yield compared with the control which yet are not proportional to the reduction of the tapping cuts length. The yield per centimetre of tapping cut is more important with the short cuts than the long cuts. Very strong correlations were determinate between tapping intensity and rubber yield, tapping intensity and annual mean girth increment and between tapping intensity and physiological parameters (DRC and Pi). The curve tendency equations were also determinate. In terms of rubber yield, the PB 235 fits the reduction of the tapping <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> better than the GT 1. The reduction of tapping cuts length favours a better vegetative radial growth. It does not impair the physiological profile of the trees which show signs of under-exploitation.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the effect of specific factors on chipper performance by using a mobile industrial chipper in a real-life commercial setting. The comprehensive experimental design consisted of five replications per each combination of two types of raw material, two chip discharge systems, and two cut lengths (i. e., 5 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 40 replications). Each replication consisted of a full 18 -m 3 trailer load. <b>Cut</b> <b>length</b> was manipulated by using different drum types. When all else was equal, the doubling of <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> resulted in a 50 percent increase of average chip length, a 15 percent increase of net productivity, and a 15 percent decrease in fuel consumption. The handling characteristics of the raw material had a strong impact on chipper productivity’, causing variations {{on the order of}} 20 percent. The discharge system had no significant effect on fuel consumption or productivity, but it did impact product quality and bulk density. Using a blower allowed increasing bulk density between 4 and 7 percent, whereas the installation of a belt conveyor reduced the incidence of small chips and fine particles by up to 30 percent. ©Forest Products Society 2012...|$|E

40|$|Clothing damage {{analysis}} is a forensic discipline which provides mainly qualitative evidential value to criminal cases. This two-part investigation strengthens {{the value of}} clothing damage analysis through both quantitative and qualitative assessment. The aim of the first {{study was to determine}} whether the direction of a weapon (n= 6) has any influence on the force required to penetrate a 50 : 50 polyester/cotton blend fabric. This was carried out at 2 speeds - 100 mm/min and 2000 mm/min - in a controlled manner using a universal strength tester. Only 2 weapons displayed any distinct differences in forces between some, but not all directions. The variability and overlap of results dictates that caution must be exercised when reporting on the force required to stab fabric. The <b>cut</b> <b>lengths</b> were examined to determine whether stab <b>cuts</b> <b>lengths</b> reflected the weapon width. The cuts were always smaller than the blade width and the bias cuts were always smaller than those in the warp and weft; this was due to the natural stretch which is more pronounced in the bias. The aim of the second study was to discover the evidential value of clothing damage after weathering. Stab cuts were created by different knives (n= 2) into the same fabric draped over polystyrene, in the warp and bias directions. The samples were mounted and placed outside for periods of 1, 4 and 8 weeks. The damage was analysed through measurements of the cuts (quantitative), and the identity of the weapon was determined through the cut morphology (qualitative). The stab <b>cuts</b> <b>lengths</b> changed progressively through time, more so in the bias than the warp, but the weapon types remained identifiable.
