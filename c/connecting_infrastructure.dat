50|$|On 28 October 1940, Italy {{started the}} Greco-Italian War by {{launching}} {{an invasion of}} the Kingdom of Greece from Albania. In part, the Italians attacked Greece because of the growing influence of Germany in the Balkans. Both Yugoslavia and Greece had governments friendly to Germany. Mussolini launched the invasion of Greece in haste after the Kingdom of Romania, a state which he perceived as lying within the Italian sphere of influence, allied itself with Germany. The order to invade Greece was given by Mussolini to Badoglio and Army Chief of Staff Mario Roatta on 15 October, {{with the expectation that}} the attack would commence within 12 days. Badoglio and Roatta were appalled given that, acting on his orders, they had demobilised 600,000 men three weeks prior. Given the expected requirement of at least 20 divisions to facilitate success, the fact that only eight divisions were currently in Albania, and the inadequacies of Albanian ports and <b>connecting</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> adequate preparation would require at least three months.

40|$|Project (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Developing {{countries}} have {{an abundance of}} renewable energy sources but the implementation of cost effective projects, to harness this energy and provide a support system to the ever-increasing demand from the conventional sources, are rare. Rapid depletion of fossil fuel resources and the environmental concerns associated with them make electricity generation from certain alternate sources increasingly important for the future. This project presents a system running solely on renewable energy sources. It utilizes solar energy and biomass as fuels in a {{combined cycle power plant}} to provide clean energy to the rapidly developing city of Maninagar in India. The solar and biomass parts of the plant will share turbines and <b>connecting</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> reducing the project cost and allowing continuous power generation. The plant can provide peaking power using a combination of the two, regardless of the time or weather. Operating strategy is designed to maximize solar energy use. The biomass is used to provide fuel during cloudy periods. The turbine-generator efficiency is optimal at full load, therefore the use of biomass supplement to allow full load operation maximizes plant output. The cost assessment of the project remains the most crucial part in planning of a non-conventional energy based power generation system. Different approaches to energy conversion from solar and biomass sources, the financial risks involved and the future aspects are presented with the anticipated costs for the planned project.

40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} {{dissemination}} of data in a vehicular network in which the density of equipped vehicles, or all vehicles, is very low, and {{in which there is}} no centrally <b>connected</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> such as a network of gateways. In this environment, a vehicle is rarely in communication range of another vehicle, so that protocols based on forwarding messages along a chain of vehicles in communication range are not effective. Similarly, the lack of centrally <b>connected</b> network <b>infrastructure</b> precludes protocols that use a fixed network of gateways to transfer messages. Our solution is based on using a collection of stationary, stand-alone dead drops that exchange data with vehicles that pass by them. Although the dead drops do not communicate among themselves or with a central network, their limited ability to store and forward data can improve the connectivity of a vehicular network. We use simulation-based experiments to demonstrate that the use of dead drops results in significant improvements in both the rate of data dissemination and the robustness to frequent changes in the set of participating vehicles.

40|$|In {{last few}} decades, Asian {{production}} networks have contributed significantly toward the rapid trade expansion {{and economic growth}} in East Asia. Developed Asia produces technology-intensive intermediate goods and capital goods and ships them to the People Republic of China (PRC) and ASEAN for assembly by lower-skilled workers. The finished products are then exported to the US, Japan, Europe, and other countries. In view of ongoing global financial crisis and European debt crisis, {{the ability of the}} rest of the world to absorb Asia's exports has decreased. Export production in some Asian countries has also been subsidized by artificially low prices for labor, land, and energy, and by lax enforcement of environmental regulations. Asian economies should thus rebalance away from relying too much on exporting subsidized goods to developed economies. On the supply side, the best way to rebalance growth is to increase productivity in order to raise wage rates and living standards. This can be done by leveraging production networks to graduate to higher value-added, knowledge-intensive activities. On the demand side, producers in the region should turn to Asian consumers as an engine of growth. This can be facilitated by improving connectivity through increased investment in <b>connecting</b> <b>infrastructure</b> such as transport and telecommunications; and by implementing a region-wide FTA. This paper addresses these issues by providing an analytic description of production networks in Asia. It then discusses how developing Asian countries could leverage production networks to facilitate technology transfer to domestic firms and how a regional FTA could bring Asian producers and consumers together. Finally, it considers how infrastructure investment in large and connecting projects could help to rebalance and sustain growth in the region through increased connectivity and reducing trade costs...|$|E

40|$|Because of its {{polycentric}} organization {{the system}} of the urban network of Randstad Holland is very much dependant on the <b>connecting</b> <b>infrastructure</b> lines between the sub agglomerations and urban centres. The use and efficiency of the infrastructure network has been the subject for debate for the last years, resulting in programs that consider strategies related to the American theory of Transit-Oriented Development, which refers to a regional network of higher density, mixed-use, living environments centred around public transport stops, {{to be one of the}} possible answers to the rising mobility and urbanisation problems, which are considered a major threat to the international competitive position of the Randstad. The Stedenbaan project in the southern part of Randstad Holland (Zuidvleugel) that deals with this issue, is about the improvement of the regional public transport system by 'regionalizing' existing national railway corridors with spatial developments along the network, which would have to add to the realisation of a single cohesive metropolitan area with a heightened level of interaction between functions. (Atelier Zuidvleugel 2006) Because of the fact that in many cases these lines run through existing built environments, the main focus of the developments will be in the framework of restructuring and transformation, which can be seen as the motive for this study. In this context, local neighbourhoods in the vicinity of railway infrastructure are going to be confronted with the regional scale if a new station will be realised together with a Transit-Oriented Development related strategy. In addition, the perspective of the large infrastructure within the city, often considered as physical and psychological barriers between city districts and exceptional elements in the urban tissue, will change. The main research questions of this thesis are: Can a regional programme as Stedenbaan, based on the principles of Transit-Oriented Development, be deployed for local urban regeneration? - How should we treat infrastructure barriers within this context? The study consists of two main parts: A Body of Knowledge, which consists of a theoretical framework and a documentation of the location-specific context (Atlas) and an implementation of its outcomes in a design case. The theoretical framework consists of a reflection on the existing theories and on Transit-Oriented Development and Stedenbaan and their backgrounds. The design case is about the Oude Lijn (Old Line) railway through the Leiden region, which will be used to host the Stedenbaan system, and the potential new station area of Leiden De Mors, of which it is mentioned to be realised in the period after 2020. Its location on a crossing of roads, waterways and railroads already provide enough complexity for a single design case. The Stedenbaan conditions will only add more complexity to this.
