40|$|This paper {{discusses}} compost production yields as {{a percent}} of raw product mix using poultry litter, poultry processing plant dissolved air flotation skimmings, sawdust, wood chips and ground yard debris. Three different mixes were used and identified as Mixes 1, 2 and 3. Mixes 1 and 2 were produced using windrows and a windrow turner and Mix 3 was made using a covered in-channel <b>compost</b> <b>turner.</b> Mixes 1 and 2 were poultry litter compost with a screened mass yield of 80 and 77 percent, respectively. Mix 3 was a dissolved air flotation compost with a screened mass yield of 40 percent. Results from plant experiments show poultry litter compost can be used successfully in potting mixes for poinsettia and chrysanthemum production. A compost produced from dissolved air flotation skimmings, a poultry processing waste, can be used in field corn production but had little influence in the production of soybeans. Zntroduction Compost facility managers need to understand the amount of compost produced from a given amount of ingredients or yield they will have for sale. Bench-scale laborator...|$|E
40|$|This project {{tested at}} the field scale, five on-site, {{non-proprietary}} bioremediation processes on weathered petroleum hydrocarbons from a fire fighter training area. Two bioremediation processes based on fungi (commercially produced white rot fungus, Pleurotus ostreatus, and aged, coarse wood chips, 'compost', with naturally occurring fungi) were applied with variations and compared to one control: a typical static biopile. An elevated-face <b>compost</b> <b>turner</b> was used to turn the soil in selected windrows for aeration. Statistically-based sampling was employed and quality control measures were enforced for sampling and analysis. The treatment options examined for the contaminated soil were: (1) white rot fungus and compost, (2) compost, poultry manure and turning, (3) compost, synthetic nitrogen-phosphorous-potassium fertilizer, and turning, (4) compost, the above synthetic fertilizer, and no turning, and (5) the above synthetic fertilizer, and no turning (static biopile). The compost and poultry manure process performed the best, remediating 35 tonnes of soil contaminated with 6000 mg/kg of mineral oil and grease (MOG) to the remediation criteria of 1000 mg/kg in 19 days and to less than 300 mg/kg in less than 56 days. The net rate of bioremediation was 100 mg/kg/day of MOG. The estimated cost of this process for commercial applications, excluding labour, excavation and site preparation, was $ 18 to $ 29 per tonne, depending {{on the cost of}} the poultry manure...|$|E
50|$|To {{properly}} use a <b>compost</b> windrow <b>turner,</b> it {{is ideal}} to compost {{on a hard}} surfaced pad. Heavy-duty <b>compost</b> windrow <b>turners</b> allow the user to obtain optimum results with the aerobic hot composting process. By using four wheel drive or tracks the windrow turner is capable of turning compost in windrows located in remote locations. With a self-trailering option this allows the <b>compost</b> windrow <b>turner</b> to convert itself into a trailer to be pulled by a semi-truck tractor. These two options combined allow the <b>compost</b> windrow <b>turner</b> to be easily hauled anywhere and to work compost windrows in muddy and wet locations.|$|R

30|$|This {{diagnosis}} {{concludes that}} there is a potential of organic wastes estimated up to 1 Million of dry matter year− 1, and 13 million euro worth of N, P, and K can be generated by composting all horticultural wastes. Compost has not only beneficial effects on soil fertility, but also on plant nutrition. However, the lack of regulation relating to the composting activity in Morocco engenders problems of process monitoring and low quality of produced compost. This maturity not being achieved can present serious phytotoxic risks for the crops. The functioning of the composting plants raises problems of water pollution, whilst the effects on the soil need to be studied further. The management policies of wastes should favor its valorization, either in terms of recycling, or in terms of energy valuation. Composting activity should be organized through a professional association, and employs a skilled labor force to ensure impermeable composting plants. The use of computer software for the optimization of mixtures should also be encouraged. Furthermore, the optimal composting approach is the open dynamic windrow, using necessarily a <b>compost</b> <b>turner</b> to homogenize the organic material. There is no need to remind that the monitoring of temperature and oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide release are important to achieve an adequate maturity level. For this purpose, also there are many multi-parametric devices available for large composting plant. The acceptance by local farmers of the benefits of compost to the soil and crops would be a significant incentive to reduce the expensive mineral fertilizers and optimize their use. The development of the composting activities is actually limited and has to be supported by scientific research to afford a better knowledge concerning the real impact of compost on agriculture, environment, and public health.|$|E
40|$|The {{diversion}} of biodegradable waste from landfill is of key importance {{in developing a}} sustainable waste strategy {{for the next decade}} and beyond. The proliferation of waste treatment technologies such as mechanical biological treatment, anaerobic digestion and composting will be paramount in achieving this strategic goal. Composting plant is one of the end technology, which is widely used in waste processing of the biodegradable waste. These wastes originate from the maintenance of green areas in the cities and the municipalities and from the separatelly collected biodegradable waste from the citizens. There is also possible to process other biodegradable materials whose origin may be in other technologies of waste management at the composting plant. The most commonly used technology of composting is windrow system. Technological operations, which are necessary for the proper conduct of the composting process, may have negative influence on the environment in the immediate vicinity of composting plant. As pollutants we can mark particular odor and microorganisms. The largest group of microorganisms in the monitored air were psychrophilic and mesophilic bacteria and microscopic thermotolerant fungi. The amount of thermophillic actinomycetes ranged from 10 to 84. 000 CFU∙m− 3 (colony forming units per m 3). Furthermore, it was confirmed that the maximum air contamination has been found during aeration of windrow by <b>compost</b> <b>turner</b> and during the sieving of the mature compost. For each indicator, the increase in concentrations due to the turning of compost windrow as compared to the background concentration obtained in natural environments and upwind of composting plants was determined. At a distance of 150 [*]m from the composting plant, only low numbers of indicator organisms at a regular occurrence in the air has been found...|$|E

Nowadays, in PG Takalar, the management of sugarcane litter is done conventionally by burning the litter in the field. It is also found from the study that to manage the sugarcane litter in 4186 ha area, the number of machinery needed to support the mechanization of sugarcane litter management were 48 units of tractor, 13 units of trash rake, 31 units of trailer, 4 units of applicator, 18 units of chopper, 3 units of truck, 3 units of <b>composting</b> <b>turner,</b> and 3 units of loader...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Compost</b> windrow <b>turners</b> were {{developed}} to produce compost {{on a large scale}} by Fletcher Sims Jr. of Canyon, Texas [...] They are traditionally a large machine that straddles a windrow of 4 feet (1.25 meters) or more high, by as much as 12 feet (3.5 meters) across. Although smaller machines exist for small windrows, most operations use large machines for volume production. Turners drive through the windrow at a slow rate of forward movement. They have a steel drum with paddles that are rapidly turning. As the turner moves through the windrow, fresh air (oxygen) is injected into the compost by the drum/paddle assembly, and waste gases produced by bacterial decomposition are vented. The oxygen feeds the aerobic bacteria and thus speeds the composting process.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Sugar cane {{plantation}} {{have the}} potential to produce organic fertilizers such as compost from organic waste litter cane. Based on research conducted by Toharisman (1991), litter weight of harvested sugar cane reach 20 - 25 tons/ha. Litter is made up of the wood on the leaves, shoots, and sugarcane are not transported to the factory. Untapped potential by sugar cane plantations in an effort to increase sugar production. It is seen by still doing the burning litter after several days of logging process, because litter can interfere with the operation of equipment and machinery at the time of land preparation. To manage the litter on dry land sugarcane plantations needed mechanization for the activities to be carried out is a strenuous activity both on land and in composting house. The mechanization is technology that serves to manage litter cane into compost whom give benefit to the soil and sugar cane. Tools and equipment for composting such as; tractor, trash rake, trailer, <b>composting</b> <b>turner,</b> loaders, trucks, chopper, and composting house.
