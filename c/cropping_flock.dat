5000|$|Canaanite {{religion}} was {{strongly influenced by}} their more powerful and populous neighbors, and shows clear influence of Mesopotamian and Egyptian religious practices. Like other people of the Ancient Near East Canaanite religious beliefs were polytheistic, with families typically focusing on veneration of the dead {{in the form of}} household gods and goddesses, the Elohim, while acknowledging the existence of other deities such as Baal and El, Asherah and Astarte. Kings also played an important religious role and in certain ceremonies, such as the hieros gamos of the New Year, may have been revered as gods. [...] "At the center of Canaanite {{religion was}} royal concern for religious and political legitimacy and the imposition of a divinely ordained legal structure, as well as peasant emphasis on fertility of the <b>crops,</b> <b>flocks,</b> and humans." ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{agricultural}} intensification has caused severe population declines among bird species which use farmland for breeding and overwintering, while migrating bird species may benefit from intensive farming, but in turn damage crops. Knowledge of the habitat selection of migrating birds is important from both a conservation and agro-economic point of view. We investigated the habitat preferences of three common migrating goose species: White-fronted Goose Anser albifrons, Bean Goose A. fabalis and Greylag Goose A. anser during the autumn of 2009 in western Poland. A total of 24 flocks of these species were identified. Geese preferred large, elevated fields that were remote from forests and human settlements but in close proximity to a lake. Geese selected maize stubbles and avoided winter cereals. They selected sites in landscapes with a lower diversity of <b>crops.</b> <b>Flock</b> size was negatively correlated with the proportion of pastures in the landscape, but it increased with field size, distance to forest and distance to town. Our results are in contrast with the paradigm that less intensive farmland positively influences habitat use by birds during foraging. We advise the delayed ploughing of stubbles with the aim of creating appropriate foraging habitats for geese and minimizing damage to cereal crops...|$|R

So it’s an incredible symbol. Here land equals power. And this project shows that with {{the will of the}} people, it’s possible to confiscate and restore mafia land". It has not been easy reclaiming confiscated mafia land for the community. The first year after the cooperative had just sowed their <b>crops,</b> a <b>flock</b> of sheep came from nowhere to destroy them. The day before the project's first grain harvest, every combine harvester in the area mysteriously disappeared.|$|R

Among Bhutan's most pressing issues are traditional firewood collection, <b>crop</b> and <b>flock</b> protection, and wildlife conservation, as well as modern concerns such as industrial pollution, waste disposal, and climate change that threaten Bhutan's population and biodiversity. Land and water use have also become matters of environmental concern in both rural and urban settings. In addition to these general issues, others such as landfill availability and air and noise pollution are particularly prevalent in relatively urbanized and industrialized areas of Bhutan. In many cases, the least financially and politically empowered find themselves the most affected by environmental issues.|$|R
50|$|White-winged doves feed on {{a variety}} of seeds, grains, and fruits. Western white-winged doves (Zenaida asiatica mearnsii) migrate into the Sonoran Desert to breed during the hottest time of the year because they feed on pollen and nectar, and later on the fruits and seeds of the saguaro cactus. They also visit feeders, eating the food dropped on the ground. Cracked corn is a {{favorite}} of doves. This gregarious species can be an agricultural pest, descending on grain <b>crops</b> in large <b>flocks.</b> It is also a popular gamebird in areas of high population.|$|R
40|$|An {{appraisal}} of goat production in a small-holder rural farming area of Zimbabwe. A survey {{was carried out}} to evaluate goat production in a crop-livestock farming area {{in the north of}} Zimbabwe. The objectives of the study were to determine goat production systems and productivity. Qualitative information was obtained using participatory rural appraisal techniques (PRA) while quantitative data was obtained through administration of a structured questionnaire to 317 households. The major finding of the survey indicated that the predominant goat breed found was the “small” indigenous Mashona goat. The goats were reared exclusively through extensive foraging during the dry season but were herded, tethered or a combination was used during the <b>cropping</b> season. <b>Flock</b> sizes were small, averaging 12 goats/household resulting in few goats available for sale or slaughter. All goat sales were informal. Ninety one percent of farmers indicated interest in cross breeding Mashona does with Boer bucks to improve the size of the Mashona...|$|R

60|$|But these {{means of}} traffic and travel soon ceased to suffice. Then the Ohio people {{felt the need}} of getting out with their {{increasing}} <b>crops,</b> their multiplying <b>flocks</b> and herds, and they made their need known to the nation, {{to which they were}} everywhere akin, and the nation answered through Congress by beginning, in 1806, the National Road, which was finished by 1838, from Baltimore as far as Indiana. This road first opened the East to Ohio; then in 1811 a steamboat made its appearance on the Beautiful River, and after that steam commanded all the Southern and Southwestern waters for us, {{as well as those of}} the inland seas on the North. Then, that all these waters might be united, the state began in 1825 to build a system of canals, from Cleveland to Portsmouth and from Toledo to Cincinnati. When these canals were completed, with their branches, they gave the people some nine hundred miles of navigable waters within their own borders. The main lines were built, not by companies for private profit as the railroads have since been built, but by the people for the people, and it may be said that the great prosperity of Ohio began with them. Wherever they ran they drained the swamps and made the land not only habitable but beautiful. They were dug by Ohio people, and the sixteen millions of dollars that they cost came back into the hands of the men who gladly taxed themselves for the outlay. The towns along their course grew, and new towns rose out of the forests and prairies.|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Several alternative sampling methods have been recently evaluated for detection of Salmonella on broiler carcasses during commercial processing. The present study evaluated and compared four sampling techniques: carcass rinse, vent skin flap sampling, thoracic skin flap sampling, and the FSIS approved sponge method in a turkey processing plant. Carcass rinse was consistently and significantly superior to tested alternatives for the detection of Salmonella in this plant. Salmonella recovery using the carcass rinse technique on split flocks at the re-hang area from 2 different scald systems suggested that countercurrent water flow improved the microbiological quality when temperatures were similar. However, elevations of the concurrent scald tank temperature eliminated the apparent benefit of directional flow. In contrast to most previously-reported observations in broiler processing plants, overall Salmonella recovery did not increase during processing and a significantly (P < 0. 05) lower overall recovery incidence from 4 flocks was observed immediately pre-chill as compared to post-feather removal. Also in contrast to previously-reported data from broiler processing plants, overall Salmonella recovery incidence in the turkey ceca was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than in the <b>crop</b> in 9 <b>flocks</b> evaluated. These data suggest that microbiological investigations to determine plant-specific critical control points in turkey plants are warranted prior to implementation of intervention strategies. After evaluation of turkey processing, we evaluated broiler carcasses in a commercial broiler processing plant for Salmonella incidence on carcasses that had been passed or retained by the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) with regard to visible fecal or ingesta contamination. Contaminated and non-contaminated carcasses were removed from the processing line at the site of FSIS inspection (pre-immersion chilling) and subjected to the carcass rinse sampling procedure for Salmonella incidence recovery. Broiler flocks were evaluated over a 2 day period. Although a numerical association of increasing Salmonella recovery with visible contamination was observed, no significant (P < 0. 05) differences in Salmonella recovery incidence were identified in any single flock or combined data when evaluated. These data suggest that focus on organoleptic parameters of inspection may result in disappointing microbiologic improvements in broiler carcass quality...|$|R
