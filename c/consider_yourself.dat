25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us {{from our point of view}} the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you <b>consider</b> <b>yourself</b> as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.|$|E

There was much media interest in Martínez's [...] "return to Yankee Stadium" [...] for Game 2, as he told reporters at a pre-game press conference [...] "When you have 60,000 people chanting your name, waiting for you to throw the ball, you have to <b>consider</b> <b>yourself</b> someone special, someone that really has a purpose out there." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, she started an {{on-screen}} relationship with Benoit, {{who at the}} time was involved in a feud with her real-life husband, Kevin Sullivan. On December 7, on WCW Saturday Night, during a post-match interview with Sullivan, a home movie of the couple canoodling in a kitchen was played in front of him. Woman taunted Sullivan by saying, [...] "You can't find me" [...] and [...] "I'm my own woman," [...] while Benoit added: [...] "You <b>consider</b> <b>yourself</b> the master of human chess. Well, my bishop just took your queen". After the video, Sullivan stood there speechless, and his manager Jimmy Hart led him off stage. This feud between Benoit and Sullivan saw Woman clashing with Sullivan's then-valet Jacquelyn at ringside. In one match, the two ladies were strapped together, took shots at each other, and used the strap connecting them as a weapon against the men.|$|E
2500|$|Intense media {{interest}} preceded Martínez's [...] "return to Yankee Stadium" [...] in Game 2 of the World Series.

[...] Martínez pitched effectively in his second-ever World Series start, but left the game in the 7th inning trailing, 2–1, and wound up taking the loss. Before his second start of the Series, Martínez called himself and opposing pitcher Andy Pettitte [...] "old goats", and acknowledged that Red Sox fans were rooting for him: [...] "I know that they don't like the Yankees to win, not even in Nintendo games." [...] However, Martínez allowed 4 runs in 4 innings, falling to 0–2 as the Phillies lost the sixth game and the 2009 World Series to the New York Yankees.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, {{scholars}} {{focused on}} self-identification {{as a good}} measure of a person's political independence. The value of self-identification {{as a measure of}} a person's political independence or partisanship is that it is seen as a proxy for the behavior which should be exhibited by the independent voter. Additionally, self-identification could be easily captured either with a nominal question ("Do you self-identify with an existing political party?", a question which is answered with a [...] "yes" [...] or a [...] "no"), or by a structured ordinal question ("Generally speaking, do you <b>consider</b> <b>yourself</b> a Democrat, a Republican, an independent, or what?"). The first analyses of this measure of political independence found that there were significant differences between those individuals who self-identified as [...] "independent" [...] and those who listed [...] "no preference" [...] as to party identification. Individuals who expressed [...] "no preference" [...] usually exhibited low levels of interest in politics, low levels of knowledge about the candidates and issues, low frequency of voting, and less {{confidence in their ability to}} influence politics.|$|E

2500|$|Like many colleges, Brown {{mandates}} forced medical {{leaves for}} students expressing feelings of self-harm, depression, schizophrenia, {{or other forms}} of mental illness. Controversy arises within the college as to whether Brown follows the US Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, with Brown's own newspaper, The Brown Daily Herald, criticizing the University's policy behind readmission from psychological medical leave. According to a 2010 article in The Brown Daily Herald, even Dean of Student Life & Chair of the Medical Leave Readmission Committee, Maria Suarez, admits that “I wish we had more resources to connect with students,” Suarez said. “The support is there, but it is student-initiated.” However, Suarez has been widely criticized within and outside the University as being non-compliant with American ADA laws, often denying students readmission for little to no reason. Moreover, the University leaves students with few guidelines on how to become readmitted; students report that very little communication is made with the University during a leave of absence, and that the University does not aid disabled students in their progress. One mentally disabled student alleges, after 5 semesters of mandatory leave, that: [...] "One of the administrators , he claims, told him: [...] "You should <b>consider</b> <b>yourself</b> lucky because Brown's better than other schools. At least you're not getting kicked out of Brown."' The psychological leave readmission process takes place once every 6 months, and requires only a student's statement and a psychiatrist's or psychologist's statement of well-being, with no interview. Many students report that the process is not thorough enough to judge one's own progress in mental health, thereby violating ADA rights; the denial letters are often short and generic, with one sentence changed at most for multiple denials.|$|E
