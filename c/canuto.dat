25|$|Roberto Fernandez <b>Canuto</b> (born April 13, 1973 in Gijon) is a Spanish film {{director}} and screenwriter. He {{belongs to a}} new generation of filmmakers from Spain with learning or working experiences internationally and with multicultural influences. Roberto F. <b>Canuto</b> {{is one of the first}} European directors to establish stable collaborations within the Chinese industry. Since 2010 he co-directs all his films with the Chinese director Xu Xiaoxi and together open a film production company in China, Almost Red Productions.|$|E
25|$|Even {{still at}} an early stage of his career, Roberto obtains {{international}} recognition as all his films have been selected and awarded in many international film festivals. Due to the themes treated and the distinct style of his films, Roberto F. <b>Canuto</b> is considered in some circles as a promise and a director to follow.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{a group of}} {{students}} noticed the day of Saint Canute in the month of January of the Catholic Calendar, whose translation in Spanish (<b>canuto)</b> {{is also one of the}} various names used for a spliff. Thus, they decided to celebrate an anti-prohibitionist festival. Throughout the years, the festival consisted of anti-prohibitionist lectures, film projections, and a central activity consisting of a procession of Saint Canute mocking Spanish Holy Week imagery that was held the third Thursday of June. Over the last years, due to the proximity of the autumn-winter semester exams, most of the activities were abandoned, leaving over a massive gathering. At the same time more people, especially from outside the university, were attending. This led to university authorities having to find a way to halt the festival.|$|E

The kissing scene between the characters {{is a key element}} of the film. According to the Canuto: [...] "I wanted to create a montage for the kissing scene. In order to do so, we decided to break standard time and space {{in order to create a}} special tempo that surprises the viewer and suspends the reality of the experience. The kissing scene was difficult to film due to the position of movement in such a tight space. This was key to delivering the right feel and emotion. Kylan and Kjord deliver a moving and touching scene that is also the zenith of the whole story." ...|$|R

This study {{starts with}} {{balances}} deduced by Baumert and Peters (2004, 2005) from results of stratified-shear experiments made in channels and wind tunnels by Itsweire (1984) and Rohr and Van Atta (1987), and of free-decay experiments in a resting stratified tank by Dickey and Mellor (1980). Using {{a modification of}} <b>Canuto’s</b> (2002) ideas on turbulence and waves, these balances are merged with an (internal) gravity-wave energy balance presented for the open ocean by Gregg (1989), without mean-flow shear. The latter was augmented by a linear (viscous) friction term. Gregg’s wave-energy source is interpreted on its long-wave spectral end as internal tides, topography, large-scale wind, and atmospheric low-pressure actions. In addition, internal eigen waves, generated by mean-flow shear, and {{the aging of the}} wave field from a virginal (linear) into a saturated state are taken into account. Wave packets and turbulence are treated as particles (vortices, packets) by ensemble kinetics so that the loss terms in all three balances have quadratic form. Following a proposal by Peters (2008), the mixing efficiency of purely wave-generated turbulence is treated as a universal constant, as well as the turbulent Prandtl number under neutral conditions. It is shown that: (i) in the wind tunnel, eigen waves are switched off, (ii) due to remotely generated long waves or other non-local energy sources, coexistence equilibria of turbulence and waves are stable even at Richardson numbers as high as 103; (iii) the three-equation system is compatible with geophysically shielded settings like certain stratified laboratory flows. The agreement with a huge body of observations surprises. Gregg’s (1989) wave-model component and the a. m. universal constants taken apart, the equations contain only one additional dimensionless parameter for the eigen-wave closure, estimated as Y ≈ 1. 35...|$|R
