50|$|The {{initiative}} for the <b>congress</b> <b>was</b> superficially taken by an Ottoman Albanian Constitutional Committee (Osmanli arnaut meşrutiyet komisioni) in Diber. However the entire organization {{was formed by}} the Young Turks. The first impression <b>was</b> that the <b>congress</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> purely Albanian because the first invitations were addressed only to Albanians. Gradually all other nationalities of the Albanian and Macedonian vilayets, excluding the Greeks, were welcomed to send delegates.

He settled in Leavenworth in 1857, residing in a house at 515 North Esplanade Street. Around this same time Anthony was involved with the Underground Railroad in Leavenworth, helping William Dominick Matthews, a freedman, provide refuge to escaped slaves.|$|R
25|$|Except for {{the four}} states west of the Mississippi River (Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas) all Confederate states' {{apportionment}} in the U.S. <b>Congress</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> decline into the 1860s. In the Confederate Congress, all would have larger delegations than they had from the census of 1850, except South Carolina, which was equal, and Missouri, which declined by one. The Confederate States Congress maintained representation in Virginia, Tennessee and Louisiana throughout its existence. Unlike the United States <b>Congress,</b> there <b>was</b> no requirement {{for a majority of}} the voters in 1860 to vote for representatives for them to be seated. from 1861 to 1863, Virginia (east, north and west), Tennessee and Louisiana had U.S. representation. Then, for 1863–1865, only the newly made West Virginia had U.S. representation. West Virginians living in counties not under Federal control, however, continued to participate in Confederate elections.|$|R
40|$|China {{has gone}} through a quarter century of reform. To date, the market system is already firmly established, and China has {{formally}} {{become a member of the}} World Trade Organization (WTO). It can be said that the major issues of reform in the realm of the economy in China have already all been solved, and what remain as tasks to be completed are simply tasks of amending, repairing, and perfecting the system. Therefore, it is quite natural that people would start to focus their attention on issues of political reform. The Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) Sixteenth <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be convened this fall, and there it will complete a generational transition at the highest level of power and authority. The clamor for political reform has become increasingly loud and vocal in such a sensitive period, and there has been, and probably will continue to be, a resurfacing and resurgence of all kinds of arguments and views about these matters at this time. ...|$|E

40|$|There is {{only one}} sure way to make {{something}} happen in public policy and in politics, {{and that is to}} organize. Sometimes external events-the Great Depression, World War II, Vietnam, Watergate, September 11 th, Enron, and MCI WorldCom-will make things happen of their own accord. But we can 2 ̆ 7 t wait for events to create opportunity, and many such stimuli are in fact things we don 2 ̆ 7 t want to happen. So it is up to us. And the time for organizing is not just when an issue is at the forefront. Organizing is needed to build interest and support on issues {{over a longer period of}} time. Citizens need a reason to participate in the political process, a reason to register to vote, and a reason to participate in electing better candidates to office. The challenge not only includes getting better people to run, but also getting those already in office to behave better (even if they are not better people). Thus an issue like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) reauthorization is one part of a larger strategic agenda. We can not just show up on the day <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> vote and expect that the response we want will magically occur...|$|E
5|$|In Radovich v. National Football League, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Radovich's favor and {{declared}} the NFL {{was subject to}} antitrust laws, and the implication was that {{the legality of the}} draft and reserve clause were dubious. Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business. He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court's ruling. The House Judiciary committee, chaired by Emanuel Celler—who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision. Red Grange and Bell testified at the committee's solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the sport's success. Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements and said the draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor, and it seemed as if <b>Congress</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> accept their position. Faced with Congressional opposition, Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate with its representatives.|$|R
500|$|Following Allen's {{failed attempt}} on St. John, {{many of his}} men drifted away, presumably drawn by the needs of home and farm. Arnold then began asserting his {{authority}} over Allen for control of Ticonderoga and Crown Point. Allen publicly {{announced that he was}} stepping down as commander, but remained hopeful that the Second Continental <b>Congress</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> name [...] "a commander for this department ... Undoubtedly, we shall be rewarded according to our merit". Congress, for its part, at first not really wanting any part of the affair, effectively voted to strip and then abandon the forts. Both Allen and Arnold protested these measures, pointing out that doing so would leave the northern border wide open. They both also made proposals to Congress and other provincial bodies for carrying out an invasion of Quebec. Allen, in one instance, wrote that [...] "I will lay my life on it, that with fifteen hundred men, and a proper artillery, I will take Montreal". Allen also attempted correspondence with the people of Quebec and with the Indians living there in an attempt to sway their opinion toward the revolutionary cause.|$|R
5000|$|The case {{concerned}} the legality and constitutionality of Department of Health and Human Services regulations {{on the use}} of funds spent by the U.S. federal government to promote family planning (Title X). With Title X of the Public Health Service Act, Congress prohibited the funds from being [...] "used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning." [...] In 1988, the Republican-appointed Secretary of Health and Human Services issued new regulations that prohibited projects receiving these funds from not only providing abortions, but also counseling, advising, or promoting the idea that a woman seek an abortion. These regulations were challenged {{on the grounds that they}} were not permissibly within the scope of the statute and that they violated the First and Fifth Amendments. Rust v. Sullivan (1991) was a challenge to Title X regulations of Health and Human Services that indicated how a certain program adopted by Congress, passed by <b>Congress,</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> implemented. Planned Parenthood and the state and city of New York sued on the grounds that not receiving government funding meant that abortions in turn would not be funded.|$|R

We’re kind of at a crossroads right now of how we go forward in the future with a new issue that appeared on our radar scope only {{four or five years}} ago. Climate change is getting much, much discussion in our industry, across the entire country, and we’re watching very closely what Congress is doing in that regard. Our understanding is that <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> debate the Lieberman-Warner climate change bill in the next few weeks, and you can be assured that the electric industry is very, very interested in where that debate goes.

First of all, Nebraska is an all-public-power state. There are no investor-owned utilities in this state, at least on the electric side of the business. All of the customers we serve are our owners, so that’s who we answer to. We don’t have shareholders or stockholders, if you will, like the investor-owned utilities.

40|$|Fee {{shifting}} in patent litigation {{has been}} a hot topic in recent years. In Octane Fitness v. ICON and Highmark v. Allcare, the Supreme Court {{made it easier to}} shift fees under 35 U. S. C. § 285, which allows courts to award reasonable attorney’s fees to prevailing parties in patent cases. Moreover, several bills have been introduced in Congress since 2013 that would expand courts’ power beyond the parameters of § 285. Various aspects of these proposals have been heavily debated, including whether fee shifting should be mandatory or discretionary, how to recover fees from the “real party in interest,” and whether to adopt a one-way or two-way fee shifting scheme. These sort of design choices regarding a fee shifting regime are not simply about who should pay for patent litigation. Fee shifting schemes also provide a roadmap from lawmakers about whether and how litigation ought to proceed. Fee shifting regimes, in other words, are used to influence litigation conduct. Thus, if <b>Congress</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> alter the fee shifting landscape for patent litigation, it must make careful choices in order to incentivize certain types of patent disputes, while simultaneously discouraging others. This Article does not advocate for a new fee shifting regime for patent litigation, nor does it endeavor to design one. Instead, it focuses on one narrow but important question about fee shifting in patent cases that has received surprisingly little attention: whether prevailing parties should be able to recover attorney’s fees incurred for litigation before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) — the administrative tribunal of the U. S. Patent 2 ̆ 6 Trademark Office that was created by the America Invents Act (AIA). With the steep rise in both PTAB proceedings (post-AIA) and fee motions (post-Octane/Highmark), district courts are bound to face this question more frequently. While the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has allowed for the recovery of such fees in the past, the Federal Circuit’s analysis was flawed in light of Supreme Court precedent. Thus, this Article proposes that Congress enact legislation allowing parties who prevail at the PTAB to recover their attorney’s fees...|$|E

5000|$|In 1980, Wilson read an Associated Press {{dispatch}} on {{the congressional}} wires describing the refugees fleeing Soviet-occupied Afghanistan. The communist Democratic Republic of Afghanistan {{had taken over}} power during the Saur revolution and asked the Soviet Union to help suppress resistance from the mujahideen. According to biographer George Crile III, Wilson called {{the staff of the}} House Appropriations Committee dealing with [...] "black appropriations" [...] and requested a two-fold appropriation increase for Afghanistan. Because Wilson had just been named to the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense (which is responsible for funding CIA operations), his request went through. That was not the last time he increased the CIA budget for its Afghan operation. In 1983, he won an additional $40 million, $17 million of which was allocated for anti-aircraft weapons to shoot down Mil Mi-24 Hind helicopters. The next year, CIA officer Gust Avrakotos directly approached Wilson—breaking the CIA's policy against lobbying Congress for money—asking Wilson for $50 million more. Wilson agreed and convinced Congress, saying, [...] "The U.S. had nothing whatsoever to do with these people's decision to fight ... but we'll be damned by history if we let them fight with stones." [...] Later, Wilson succeeded in giving the Afghans $300 million of unused Pentagon money {{before the end of the}} fiscal year. Thus, Wilson directly influenced the level of United States government support for the Afghan Mujahideen. Wilson has said that the covert operation succeeded because [...] "there was no partisanship or damaging leaks." [...] Michael Pillsbury, a senior Pentagon official, used Wilson's funding to provide Stinger missiles to the Afghan resistance in a controversial decision.Joanne Herring, along with others, played a role in helping the Afghan resistance fighters get support and military equipment from the United States government. She persuaded Wilson to visit the Pakistani leadership, and after meeting with them he was taken to a major Pakistan-based Afghan refugee camp so he could see for himself the atrocities committed by the Soviets against the Afghan people. About that visit, Wilson later said that it [...] "was the experience that will always be seared in my memory, <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through those hospitals and seeing, especially those children with their hands blown off from the mines that the Soviets were dropping from their helicopters. That was perhaps the deciding thing... and it made a huge difference for the next 10 or 12 years of my life because I left those hospitals determined, as long as I had a breath in my body and was a member in <b>Congress,</b> that I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do what I could to make the Soviets pay for what they were doing!"
