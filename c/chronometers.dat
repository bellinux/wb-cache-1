5|$|Beagle carried {{only three}} <b>chronometers</b> on this expedition; the {{majority}} of the expedition's <b>chronometers</b> were on board Adventure (see next section).|$|E
5|$|Beagle {{required}} {{large numbers}} of <b>chronometers</b> because some would inevitably break down on long voyages and the <b>chronometers</b> were essential for {{the mission of the}} ship. Further, the rates of all <b>chronometers</b> vary with time. Although this can be allowed for by interpolating between the regular rate checks, {{there is no guarantee that}} the changes are linear, and often they are not. Averaging the readings from a large number of <b>chronometers,</b> especially if they are of a variety of types, will tend to cancel out such errors.|$|E
5|$|An Admiralty {{memorandum}} set out {{the detailed}} instructions. The first requirement was to resolve disagreements in the earlier surveys about the longitude of Rio de Janeiro, which was essential as the base point for meridian distances. The accurate marine <b>chronometers</b> needed to determine longitude had only become affordable since 1800; the Beagle carried 22 <b>chronometers</b> to allow corrections. The ship was to stop at specified points for four-day rating of the <b>chronometers</b> and to check them by astronomical observations: it was essential to take observations at Porto Praya and Fernando de Noronha to calibrate against the previous surveys of Owen and Foster. It was important to survey {{the extent of the}} Abrolhos Archipelago reefs, shown incorrectly in Roussin's survey, then proceed to Rio de Janeiro to decide the exact longitude of Villegagnon Island.|$|E
50|$|Captain Folger {{was given}} the Bountys azimuth compass and Larcum Kendall K2 marine <b>chronometer</b> by Adams. The K2 was the third {{precision}} marine <b>chronometer</b> made after the H4, designed by John Harrison. The <b>chronometer</b> {{was taken by the}} Spanish governor at Juan Fernandez Island. The <b>chronometer</b> was later purchased by a Spaniard named Castillo. When he died, his family conveyed it to Captain Herbert of HMS Calliope, who had it conveyed to the British Museum around 1840. The <b>chronometer</b> is now in Greenwich, London.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{chronograph}} {{is often}} {{confused with the}} term <b>chronometer.</b> Where [...] "Chronograph" [...] refers to the function of a watch, <b>chronometer</b> {{is a measure of}} how well a given timepiece performs: in order to be labeled a <b>chronometer</b> the timepiece must be certified by the COSC, the official Swiss <b>Chronometer</b> testing institute, after undergoing a series of rigorous tests for robustness, accuracy and precision under adverse conditions. A simple watch, without the stopwatch functionality, can be certified a <b>chronometer,</b> as can a clock, for example a ship's clock be used for navigation. The terms are not mutually exclusive either, for instance the Omega Seamaster 300M Chronograph GMT Co-Axial is also a COSC certified <b>chronometer</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1974: Omega Marine <b>Chronometer</b> {{certified}} {{as the world}} first Marine <b>Chronometer</b> wristwatch, accurate to 12 seconds per year ...|$|R
5|$|As {{the lead}} ship, the Adventure carried the {{majority}} of the expedition's <b>chronometers</b> during the Beagles first expedition. They are included here for completeness.|$|E
5|$|Marine <b>chronometers</b> are clocks used at sea as time standards, to {{determine}} longitude by celestial navigation.|$|E
5|$|To reach {{all points}} {{designated}} by the Admiralty for longitude measurements, it was sometimes necessary to take <b>chronometers</b> ashore, across inlets and up rivers too shallow for the ship. This put the <b>chronometers</b> at risk and the disturbance of moving them affected their accuracy. This was another reason for survey ships to carry a large number – most {{of them could be}} kept permanently in a safe, well-cushioned place on the main vessel.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>chronometer</b> is {{designed}} to operate {{for a minimum of}} 1 year on a single set of batteries. Observations may be timed and ship's clocks set with a comparing watch, which is set to <b>chronometer</b> time and taken to the bridge wing for recording sight times. [...] In practice, a wrist watch coordinated to the nearest second with the <b>chronometer</b> will be adequate.|$|R
50|$|As {{of early}} 2006, Wempe has {{established}} a <b>Chronometer</b> Observatory at Glashütte. Official <b>Chronometer</b> Certificates are now being issued {{under the auspices of}} the German standards (DIN) under government oversight and authority.|$|R
5000|$|A {{certified}} <b>chronometer</b> is a high-precision <b>chronometer</b> watch {{capable of}} displaying the seconds {{and which has}} been tested and certified by an official neutral body (Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres - COSC).|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} {{there were}} three other smaller transit telescopes, two clocks by Clemens Riefler of Munich, and other accessories including sextants, <b>chronometers,</b> and teaching tools.|$|E
5|$|During {{the passage}} from Ceylon, at one o'clock every day, the ships signalled each other their {{longitude}} that they calculated using their <b>chronometers.</b> In this way, the ships were able to compare their respective instruments, and {{the master of the}} Arniston was able to learn his longitude too, as long as he remained in the convoy.|$|E
5|$|After storms, the Beagle reached Montevideo on 26 July 1832, {{and took}} {{observations}} for the <b>chronometers.</b> An attempt {{to call at}} Buenos Aires for information was thwarted by officials, then FitzRoy agreed a request for ship's crew (and Darwin) to briefly occupy a Montevideo fort to dispel a revolution. On 22 August, after taking soundings in Samborombón Bay, the Beagle began survey work down the coast from Cape San Antonio.|$|E
50|$|A <b>chronometer</b> is a {{portable}} timekeeper that meets certain precision standards. Initially, {{the term was}} {{used to refer to}} the marine <b>chronometer,</b> a timepiece used to determine longitude by means of celestial navigation, a precision firstly achieved by John Harrison. More recently, the term has also been applied to the <b>chronometer</b> watch, a watch that meets precision standards set by the Swiss agency COSC.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Chronometer</b> {{an average}} rate of −4/+6 with a maximum daily {{variation}} of +/−5 seconds - standards prescribed by the COSC. The wider range for the <b>chronometer</b> grade is designed {{to take into account}} the differences in a watch's rate between static positions, as when the tests are performed, and the dynamic positions as when a watch is actually worn. <b>Chronometer</b> grade movements are serial numbered.|$|R
50|$|For navigational purposes, the hack {{watch is}} {{synchronized}} with the ship's marine <b>chronometer.</b> The {{use of a}} hack watch {{makes it easier to}} take sights, as the <b>chronometer</b> is normally in a fixed position in a ship - below decks and in gimbals to keep it level and protect it from the elements, while the hack watch is portable and can be carried on deck. Though not as accurate as the <b>chronometer,</b> the hack watch is accurate enough to be satisfactory over the relatively short time period between setting it from the <b>chronometer</b> and taking the sight.|$|R
5|$|At first Nansen and Johansen {{made good}} {{progress}} south, but on 13 April suffered a serious setback when {{both of their}} <b>chronometers</b> stopped. Without knowing the correct time, {{it was impossible for}} them to calculate their longitude and thus navigate their way accurately to Franz Josef Land. They restarted the watches on the basis of Nansen's guess that they were at longitude 86°E, but from then on were uncertain of their true position.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its officers and crew, the Beagle carried several , passengers without an official position. FitzRoy employed a mathematical instrument maker to maintain his 22 marine <b>chronometers</b> kept in his cabin, as well as engaging the artist/draughtsman Augustus Earle {{to go in a}} private capacity. The three Fuegians taken on the previous voyage were going to be returned to Tierra del Fuego on the Beagle together with the missionary Richard Matthews.|$|E
5|$|Beagle was {{not allowed}} to land at Tenerife through fears that those aboard would bring cholera, but the ship {{proceeded}} to Cape Verde, Fernando de Noronha and Rio de Janeiro. She then spent some time surveying the coast of South America south from Rio de Janeiro, around Tierra del Fuego, the coast of Chile and as far north as Peru. Fitz-Roy finally detached Beagle from South America in August 1835. The Admiralty had not precisely specified his itinerary across the Pacific since they could not be sure how far north {{he would be able to}} survey in the time available, and hence precisely where he would be leaving from. But they did specify that he should stop at Tahiti, a point of previously well-determined longitude. The Admiralty also required that, like the journey across the Atlantic, it should be done in small stages to frequently rate the <b>chronometers.</b> Fitz-Roy chose to go via the Galápagos Islands. Subsequently Beagle visited Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia and Mauritius.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a pity," [...] {{he would}} suggest to Captain Doane, [...] "that {{you have only}} one <b>chronometer.</b> The entire fault may be with the <b>chronometer.</b> Why did you sail with only one chronometer?" ...|$|R
50|$|In 1974 Omega {{introduced}} the Omega Marine <b>Chronometer,</b> the first watch {{ever to be}} certified as a marine <b>chronometer,</b> accurate to 12 seconds per year using a quartz circuit that produces 2,400,000 vibrations per second.|$|R
5000|$|Testing {{criteria}} {{are based on}} ISO 3159 which defines a wrist <b>chronometer</b> with spring-balance oscillator. Only movements which meet the precision criteria established under ISO 3159 are granted an official <b>chronometer</b> certificate. (Compare ISO 3158.) ...|$|R

25|$|Three of the {{lanthanide}} elements have radioactive isotopes {{with long}} half-lives (138La, 147Sm and 176Lu) {{that can be}} used to date minerals and rocks from Earth, the Moon and meteorites.Nd, 150Nd, 148Sm, 151Eu, 152Gd) but they are not used as <b>chronometers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Just some of such {{instruments}} included <b>chronometers,</b> telescopes, sextants, microscopes, magnetic compasses, thermometers, hygrometers, barometers, electrometers, and eudiometers. Furthermore, it {{was necessary}} to have multiple makes and models of each specific instrument to compare errors and constancy among each type.|$|E
50|$|The similar-sounding terms {{chronograph}} and <b>chronometer</b> {{are often}} confused, although they mean altogether different things. A chronograph is a watch with an added duration timer, often a stopwatch complication (as explained above), while a <b>chronometer</b> watch is a timepiece that has met an industry standard test for performance under pre-defined conditions: a <b>chronometer</b> {{is a high}} quality mechanical or a thermo-compensated movement that has been tested and certified to operate within a certain standard of accuracy by the COSC (Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres). The concepts are different but not mutually exclusive; so a watch can be a chronograph, a <b>chronometer,</b> both, or neither.|$|R
50|$|In 1976 Omega refined {{the design}} of the Marine <b>Chronometer</b> and the Constellation (previous known as Calibre 1510) with the {{introduction}} of the caliber 1516 Marine <b>Chronometer</b> and the documented introduction of the calibre 1515 in Constellation models.|$|R
50|$|Having {{found the}} (absolute) Greenwich time, the {{navigator}} either compares {{it with the}} observed local apparent time (a separate observation) to find his longitude, or compares it with the Greenwich time on a <b>chronometer</b> (if available) if one wants to check the <b>chronometer.</b>|$|R
25|$|Rolex is {{the largest}} {{manufacturer}} of Swiss made certified <b>chronometers.</b> In 2005, {{more than half the}} annual production of COSC certified watches were Rolexes. To date, Rolex still holds the record for the most certified chronometer movements in the category of wristwatches.|$|E
25|$|It {{seems likely}} that before 1775, Arnold's {{earliest}} pocket <b>chronometers,</b> such as those supplied to Phipps and Banks, were plain watches with centre seconds motion, largely resembling Maskelyne's cylinder watch by Ellicott. Certainly, those few surviving examples are of this caliper such as No. 3.|$|E
25|$|In 1780, {{while making}} these <b>chronometers</b> for Brockbank, Earnshaw {{modified}} the pivoted detent by mounting the locking piece on a spring, thus dispensing with the pivots. Arnold managed {{to see this}} new idea and promptly took out the 1782 patent for his own design of spring detent, {{but it is not}} known whether this preceded Earnshaw's own idea.|$|E
