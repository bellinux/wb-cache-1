25|$|Carotid IMT {{has been}} {{measured}} in numerous epidemiological and clinical studies. These have shown associations with numerous risk factors, including {{type 2 diabetes}} and impaired glucose tolerance, familial hypercholesterolemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some small and larger scale clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the regression and/or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However the appropriateness of carotid IMT {{in this context is}} uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including local hemodynamics, blood pressure, shear stress and circumferential tensile stress. Changes in shear stress may adversely affect endothelial function and particle residence time, affecting the delivery and transport of potentially atherogenic particles into the arterial wall and consequent plaque formation. Blood pressure may affect IMT through blood vessel remodelling or wall hypertrophy in response to altered circumferential stress. Variations in IMT between different locations, such as the inflow side of branches, the inner curvature at bends and opposite the flow divider at bifurcations may reflect differences in local hemodynamic forces. However, an IMT greater than 0.9-1mm is highly likely to be indicative of atherosclerosis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Often, the measurement of the IMT is measured in three locations: in the common carotid (typically at one <b>cm</b> <b>proximal</b> to the flow divider), at the bifurcation, and in the internal carotid artery. IMT measurements of the far (deeper) wall, by ultrasound, are generally considered more reliable than measurements performed on the near (more superficial) wall; although measurement of both near and far wall IMT has also been advocated.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE : To prospectively {{evaluate}} {{accuracy of}} sonography for diagnosis of {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} (CTS) in patients clinically suspected of having the disease in one or both hands. MATERIALS AND METHODS : A prospective cohort of 133 patients suspected of having CTS were referred to a teaching hospital between October 2001 and June 2002 for electrodiagnostic study. One hundred twenty patients (98 women, 22 men; mean age, 49 years; range, 19 – 83 years) underwent sonography within 1 week after electrodiagnostic study. Radiologist was blinded to electrodiagnostic study results. Seventy-five patients had bilateral symptoms; 23 patients, right-hand symptoms; and 22 patients, left-hand symptoms (total, 195 symptomatic hands). Cross-sectional area of median nerve was measured at three levels: immediately proximal to carpal tunnel inlet, at carpal tunnel inlet, and at carpal tunnel outlet. Flexor retinaculum {{was used as a}} landmark to margins of carpal tunnel. Optimal threshold levels (determined with classification and regression tree analysis) for areas proximal to and at tunnel inlet and at tunnel outlet were used to discriminate between patients with and patients without disease. Sensitivity, specificity, and false-positive and false-negative rates were derived on the basis of final diagnosis, which was determined with clinical history and electrodiagnostic study results as reference standard. RESULTS: For right hands, sonography had sensitivity of 94 % (66 of 70); specificity, 65 % (17 of 26); false-positive rate, 12 % (nine of 75); and false-negative rate, 19 % (four of 21) (cutoff, 0. 09 <b>cm</b> 2 <b>proximal</b> to tunnel inlet and 0. 12 cm 2 at tunnel outlet). For left hands, sensitivity was 83 % (53 of 64); specificity, 73 % (24 of 33); false-positive rate, 15 % (nine of 62); and false-negative rate, 31 % (11 of 35) (cutoff, 0. 10 <b>cm</b> 2 <b>proximal</b> to tunnel inlet).

In the coronary artery segments visualized by echocardiography and compared with the corresponding angiographic segments, transesophageal echocardiography correctly identified 23 (96 %) of 24 left main stenoses, 11 (78 %) of 14 stenoses involving the left anterior descending artery, 6 (75 %) of 8 left circumflex stenoses and all 7 stenoses (100 %) of the right coronary artery. In all seven patients with ostial stenosis (left main artery in five and right coronary artery in two), the condition was correctly diagnosed by this technique. The sensitivity and specificity of transesophageal echocardiography in the overall evaluation of proximal coronary artery stenosis as customarily defined by angiography were 96 % and 99 % for the left main artery, 48 % and 99 % for the left anterior descending artery, 67 % and 100 % for the left circumflex artery and 37 % and 100 % for the right coronary artery, respectively. The distance of the stenotic lesion from the origin of the vessel by transesophageal echocardiography also correlated well with that measured by angiography (r = 0. 63 to 0. 99).

40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} angle between the {{circular}} smooth muscle (CSM) and longitudinal smooth muscle (LSM) fibers in the distal esophagus. METHODS: In {{order to identify}} possible mechanisms for greater shortening in the distal compared to proximal esophagus during peristalsis, the angles between the LSM and CSM layers were measured in 9 cadavers. The outer longitudinal layer of the muscularis propria was exposed after stripping the outer serosa. The inner circular layer of the muscularis propria was then revealed after dissection of the esophageal mucosa and the underlying muscularis mucosa. Photographs of each specimen were taken {{with half of the}} open esophagus folded back showing both the outer longitudinal and inner circular muscle layers. Angles were measured every one cm for 10 <b>cm</b> <b>proximal</b> to the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) by two independent investigators. Two human esophagi were obtained from organ transplant donors and the angles between the circular and longitudinal smooth muscle layers were measured using micro-computed tomography (micro CT) and Image J software. RESULTS: All data are presented as mean 1; SE. The CSM to LSM angle at the SCJ and 1 <b>cm</b> <b>proximal</b> to SCJ on the autopsy specimens was 69. 3 1; 4. 62 degrees vs 74. 9 1; 3. 09 degrees, P = 0. 32. The CSM to LSM angle at SCJ were statistically significantly lower than at 2, 3, 4 and 5 <b>cm</b> <b>proximal</b> to the SCJ, 69. 3 1; 4. 62 degrees vs 82. 58 1; 1. 34 degrees, 84. 04 1; 1. 64 degrees, 84. 87 1; 1. 04 degrees and 83. 72 1; 1. 42 degrees, P = 0. 013, P = 0. 008, P = 0. 004, P = 0. 009 respectively. The CSM to LSM angle at SCJ was also statistically significantly lower than the angles at 6, 7 and 8 <b>cm</b> <b>proximal</b> to the SCJ, 69. 3 1; 4. 62 degrees vs 80. 18 1; 2. 09 degrees, 81. 81 1; 1. 75 degrees and 80. 96 1; 2. 04 degrees, P = 0. 05, P = 0. 02, P = 0. 03 respectively. The CSM to LSM angle at 1 <b>cm</b> <b>proximal</b> to SCJ was statistically significantly lower than at 3, 4 and 5 <b>cm</b> <b>proximal</b> to the SCJ, 74. 94 1; 3. 09 degrees vs 84. 04 1; 1. 64 degrees, 84. 87 1; 1. 04 degrees and 83. 72 1; 1. 42 degrees, P = 0. 019, P = 0. 008, P = 0. 02 respectively. At 10 cm above SCJ the angle was 80. 06 1; 2. 13 degrees which is close to being perpendicular but less than 90 degrees. The CSM to LSM angles measured on virtual dissection of the esophagus and the stomach on micro CT at the SCJ and 1 <b>cm</b> <b>proximal</b> to the SCJ were 48. 39 1; 0. 72 degrees and 50. 81 1; 1. 59 degrees. Rather than the angle of the CSM and LSM being perpendicular in the esophagus we found an acute angulation between these two muscle groups throughout the lower 10 cm of the esophagus. CONCLUSION: The oblique angulation of the CSM may contribute to the significantly greater shortening of distal esophagus when compared to the mid and proximal esophagus during peristalsis...|$|E

The plantar fascia thickness was measured at four different locations: 1 <b>cm</b> <b>proximal</b> to the insertion of the plantar fascia, at the insertion of the plantar fascia on the calcaneus and separate out 1 cm + 2 cm distal to the insertion. A 10 MHz linear-array transducer was used. There were statistically significant differences in plantar fascia thickness at the four different locations (p < 0. 001) although no differences in PF thickness were found between the two distal from insertion locations (1 and 2 cm). Multiple regression analysis showed sex as independent predictor of plantar fascia thickness at 1 <b>cm</b> <b>proximal</b> to the insertion. At origin and 1 cm distal to insertion weight was an independent predictor of plantar fascia thickness. In conclusion, there are differences of thickness at different locations of plantar fascia measured by ultrasonography. Thickness at 1 <b>cm</b> <b>proximal</b> to the insertion is influenced by sex and thickness at origin and at 1 cm distal to the insertion has a direct relationship with body weight. This could be attributed to the overloading effect that weight has on plantar fascia in healthy symptomatic subjects at these two locations.

Horseradish peroxidase entered tissue {{not only from the}} lumen and adventitia as occurs with its infusion into normal tissue with the perforated balloon, but also extended from new crevices and dissection planes created by the angioplasty. Platelet aggregation, coagulation and cell proliferation, the likely causes of restenosis after angioplasty, originate in the sites of greatest tissue disruption and blood stasis. These postmortem studies suggest that active drugs are delivered to the arterial wall in a manner likely to be effective in preventing these events...|$|R
40|$|A 5 -day-old {{girl was}} brought with {{complaints}} of vomiting and non-passage of urine and stools for one day. The child had absent anal orifice and was passing urine and stools {{from a single}} perineal opening. Examination showed clinical evidence of sepsis and a grossly distended, tense, tympanitic, and tender abdomen. The perineum was well developed and the sacrum was normal on palpation. X-ray abdomen showed a massive pneumoperitoneum. After optimization, exploratory laparotomy revealed a Type II congenital pouch colon (CPC), with 3 <b>cm</b> of normal <b>proximal</b> colon, a long appendix, and a large perforation of the colonic pouch near its center on anterior aspect. There were 2 broad...|$|R
