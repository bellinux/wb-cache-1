50|$|All these errors {{depend on}} various {{physical}} phenomena specific to each sensor technology. Depending on the targeted applications {{and to be}} able to make the proper sensor choice, it is then very important to consider the needs regarding stability, repeatability, and environment sensitivity (mainly thermal and mechanical environments), on both short and long terms.Targeted performance for applications is most of the time better than sensors absolute performance. However sensor performance is repeatable over the time, with more or less accuracy, and therefore can be assessed and compensated to enhance its performance. This real-time performance enhancement is based on both sensors and IMU models. Complexity for these models will then be chosen according to the needed performance, and the type of application considered. Ability to define this model is part of sensors and IMU manufacturers know-how.Sensors and IMU models are computed in factory through a dedicated calibration sequence using multi-axes turntable and <b>climatic</b> <b>chamber.</b> They can either be computed for each individual product or generic for the whole production. Calibration will typically improve sensors raw performance by at least two decades.|$|E
5000|$|Vehicle do not behave {{the same}} way on chassis {{dynamometer}} as on the road. For example, aerodynamic shape of the vehicle does not matter. Sum of all forces on the vehicle on a real road are simulated through tires on chassis dynamometer.Increasing air drag with the speed on the road manifests as increasing braking force of the vehicle wheels. The aim {{is to make the}} vehicle on the dynamometer accelerate and decelerate {{the same way}} as on a real road.First you need to know the parameters of the [...] "behavior" [...] of the vehicle on a real road.In order to get [...] "road parameters", vehicle must be driving on ideal flat road with no wind from any direction, gear set to neutral and time needed to slow down without braking is measured in certain intervals i.e. 100-90 km/h, 90-80 km/h, 80-70 km/h 70-60 km/h etc. Slowing down from higher speed takes shorter time mainly due to air resistance.Those parameters are later set in dynamometer workstation, together with vehicle inertia. Vehicle is restrained and so called vehicle adaptation has to be performed.During vehicle adaptation dynamometer automatically slowing down from set speed, changing its own [...] "dyno parameters" [...] and trying to get same deceleration in given intervals as on real road. Those parameters are then valid for this vehicle type. Changing of set simulated inertia it is possible to simulate vehicle ability to accelerate if fully loaded, with setting gradient it is possible to simulate force if vehicle going downhill etc. Chassis dynamometers for <b>climatic</b> <b>chamber</b> does exists, where it is possible to change temperature in give range i.e. -40 to +50 °C or altitude chamber where it is possible to check fuel consumption with different temperatures or pressure and to simulate driving on mountain roads.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{field of}} {{research}} is the appearance and propagation of tears in the fabric, this issue has been partially investigated [...] and represents a fundamental data in {{the determination of the}} safety factor which should be used for a specific structure. Because tear propagation generally occurs at 25% UTS, the safety factor is generally higher than four. The test is carried out on a sample taken from a dismounted structure or by using conditioned samples of fabric which aim to reproduce the in-situ conditions. The load profile should reproduce the expected overload by pulling the sample until breakage, which should start far from the sample edge and the clamping system. The repetition of the test and different temperatures (generally -20 °C and +70 °C) offers important information about the joint behaviour at extreme conditions, such as heavy snow fall with temperatures below zero or a blast of wind during a hot summer. This type of test is generally required by designers and manufacturers and those in charge of the evaluation of the structure behaviour and the final test of the structure. Finally, in order to prevent collapses due to ponding and fluttering, the creep behaviour should be carefully considered in the design, choosing anchorages which enable periodical re-tensioning according to the predicted fall in the level of pre-stress. It is based on a monoaxial test but an accurate investigation requires the use of virgin cruciform samples of fabric and the force is applied by means of counter weights. The creep is defined as the “increase in strain with time when a constant force is applied” [...] and aims to describe the material behaviour when a constant force is applied {{over a long period of}} time. This has a considerable effect on the design and realisation of the membrane structure because a progressive increase in the material strain leads to a considerable reduction in the level of pre-stress initially induced in the structure. The sample should be maintained at a constant temperature and for specific applications it may require a proper <b>climatic</b> <b>chamber</b> for investigations at high and low temperatures.There are no complete studies about the dynamic behaviour of coated fabric and foils for structural applications. A dynamic test on coated fabrics can evaluate the response under fast loading and unloading cycles due to blasts of wind or other sources of stress. It should consider a conditioned fabric which reproduces the in-situ conditions and the testing apparatus should be able to apply a high speed load profile which is generally not possible with a common testing rig equipped with electric servomotors. The results of this type of test, despite the absence of research which can support these expectations, can highlight anomalies in the fabric strength and in the tear propagation with consequent adjustments in the safety factor applied.|$|E
