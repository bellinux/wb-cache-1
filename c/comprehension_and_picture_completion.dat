With regard to the assumption of unidimensionality, examination of the data indicated low item-factor loadings on the Information, Arithmetic, <b>and</b> <b>Picture</b> <b>Completion</b> subtests. Examination of difficulty parameters revealed a nonlinear item difficulty order on all three subtests. These results support the conclusion of previous research that the WISC-R does not adequately assess the intelligence of Native children. Possible bases for the invalidity of the WISC-R for this population are discussed and recommendations for future research are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} bias in the areas of examiner disability, and examiner and examinee gender on test scores of selected subtests of the WAIS-R. The subjects of this study were 101 nondisabled University of Arizona Introductory Psychology students who were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The treatment group was administered the Arithmetic <b>and</b> <b>Picture</b> <b>Completion</b> subtests of the WAIS-R by a wheelchair bound examiner (a nondisabled examiner posing as a disabled examiner). The control group was administered the same subtests by a nonwheelchair bound examiner. The data were analyzed by two three-way ANOVAs. The three-way analysis of variance tested for significant relationships between main effects of the three independent variables [...] examiner disability, examiner gender and examinee gender, and the scores of the arthmetic <b>and</b> <b>Picture</b> <b>Completion</b> subtests, <b>and</b> also for two-way and three-way interactive effects of the three variables and the subtest scores. Results indicated that in terms of bias operating to influence the individually administered subtest scores, only examinee gender was found to have a significant effect, with subtest scores for male examinees significantly higher than those for female examinees, on both Arithmetic <b>and</b> <b>Picture</b> <b>Completion</b> subtests. Nonsignificant relationships were found between the other two independent variables of examiner disability and examiner gender, and subtest scores. The presence of a visible, physical disability on the part of the examiner, and the gender of the examiner were not seen to be operating as bias, and were not seen to be impacting on subtest scores. Due to limitations of the study that included instrumentation, interaction of testing and treatment, interaction of selection and treatment, reactive arrangements and history, and due to lack of supportive research in the area of examinee gender as bias influencing test scores, the findings of this study need to be interpreted with caution, and should be considered speculative at best...|$|R

Thirty essential hypertensive men and women were randomly placed in one of the three groups. Attentional dimensions were assessed before and after the 10 -week treatment program (or waiting period) and the relationship between blood pressure and attentional changes were assessed. The only group to evidence significant blood pressure reduction, the &quot;Biofeedback Group, &quot; became significantly more Field Independent as measured by the EFT (p< 0. 001) and the Block Design measure (p< 0. 01) and evidenced a strong trend in the same direction on the <b>Picture</b> <b>Completion</b> measure (p< 0. 052, NS).

Complete data on anthropometry, cognitive performance, and micronutrient status were available for 1, 760 schoolchildren, 6 - 16 years of age. STH infection was identified using Kato Katz, whereas cognitive performance was assessed using Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM), block design, <b>and</b> <b>picture</b> <b>completion.</b> STH infection was found in 18 % of the children; almost exclusively hookwork infection.

A full sample of 30 rugby players at Rhodes University was compared to 27 non-contact sport controls. A reduced sample of 20 rugby players and 9 control participants provided improved control for education and IQ and was compared. Measures included the WAIS-III Vocabulary <b>and</b> <b>Picture</b> <b>Completion</b> Sub-tests to estimate IQ level, the symptom checklist on a widely used computer-based program (ImPACT), and a paper and pencil self-report 31 -Item Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire.

The symptoms reported by the rugby group appeared to be more pronounced on both the ImPACT Symptom Scale and the 31 -Item Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire when compared to the control group at both the pre-and post-season stages. It was concluded that the rugby players demonstrated evidence to support the hypothesis of having sustained more previous concussions and reporting more symptoms at the pre-season stage when compared to comtrol participants.

Participants were 20 children with autism spectrum disorder (M age: 11. 2 years) and 20 typically developing children (M age: 4. 4 years) matched on age equivalents for receptive language (autism spectrum disorder, M: 4. 6 years; typically developing, M: 4. 5 years) and expressive language (autism spectrum disorder, M: 4. 4 years; typically developing, M: 4. 5 years). Picture comprehension was assessed by asking children to identify the three-dimensional referents of line drawings. Picture production was assessed by asking children to create representational drawings of unfamiliar objects and having raters identify their referents. The results of both picture tasks revealed statistically equivalent performance for typically developing children and children with autism spectrum disorder, and identical patterns of performance across trial types. These findings suggest that early deficits in pictorial understanding displayed by minimally verbal individuals may diminish as their expressive language skills develop.

Among non-pharmacological interventions, cognitive training appears as a promising option for delaying the effects of aging on cognition. Objective: The present study describes the procedures of a cognitive training program for healthy Brazilian elderly persons (without diagnosis of dementia). Method: Cognitive tasks for the training of attention, processing speed, episodic memory and working memory were carried out. The program training was performed over 12 individual sessions, and included an Instruction Book, a Stimulus Book and Protocol Record. To assess the effects of training, five subtests of the WAIS-III test were used: <b>Picture</b> <b>completion,</b> Coding, Arithmetic, Matrix Reasoning and Digit Span. The cognitive training program was tested with 15 individuals, divided into an experimental group (EG), which received training, and a control group (CG). The EG was formed of seven participants, aged between 70 and 82 years (M= 73. 57, SD= 4. 11) and with an average schooling of 5. 8 years (SD= 1. 02). The CG was formed by 8 participants, aged 69 - 77 years (M= 74. 00, SD= 4. 58), and who had an average schooling of 2. 88 years (SD= 2. 58). Results: Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a training effect for three subtests: Coding: [F(1) = 5. 40, p= 0. 03, &# 951; 2 G= 0. 09], Arithmetic [F(1) = 9. 03, p= 0. 01, &# 951; 2 G= 0. 004] <b>and</b> <b>Picture</b> <b>completion</b> [F(1) = 8. 01, p= 0. 01, &# 951; 2 G= 0. 19]. There were no gain effects for Matrix Reasoning [F(1) = 1. 43, p= 0. 25] and Digit Span [F(1) = 10. 04, p< 0. 001]. Conclusion: The results of this pilot study show the importance of testing the impact of cognitive training through a randomized clinical trial to verify its effects on the mental performance of older adults.

Currently, no data exists on the nutritional status of Cambodian school-aged children, or on how malnutrition potentially affects their cognitive development. Objective: To assess the anthropometric and micronutrient status (iron, vitamin A, zinc, iodine) of Cambodian schoolchildren and their associations with cognitive performance. Methods: School children aged 6 - 16 y (n = 2443) from 20 primary schools in Cambodia were recruited. Anthropometry, hemoglobin, serum ferritin, transferrin receptors, retinol-binding protein and zinc concentrations, inflammation status, urinary iodine concentration and parasite infection were measured. Socio-economic data were collected in a sub-group of children (n = 616). Cognitive performance was assessed using Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM) and block design <b>and</b> <b>picture</b> <b>completion,</b> two standardized tests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III). Results: The prevalence of anemia, iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A deficiency were 15. 7 %; 51. 2 %, 92. 8 %, 17. 3 % and 0. 7 % respectively. The prevalence of stunting was 40. 0 %, including 10. 9 % of severe stunting. Stunted children scored significantly lower than non-stunted children on all tests. In RCPM test, boys with iron-deficiency anemia had lower scores than boys with normal iron status (- 1. 46, p< 0. 05). In <b>picture</b> <b>completion</b> test, children with normal iron status tended to score higher than iron-deficient children with anemia (- 0. 81; p = 0. 067) or without anemia (- 0. 49; p = 0. 064). Parasite infection was associated with an increase in risk of scoring below the median value in block design test (OR = 1. 62; p< 0. 05), and with lower scores in other tests, for girls only (both p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Poor cognitive performance of Cambodian school-children was multifactorial and significantly associated with long-term (stunting) and current nutritional status indicators (iron status), as well as parasite infection.

40|$|Introduction: Patients with {{schizophrenia}} {{are widely}} reported to show impairments {{of attention and}} neuropsychological performance, but {{the extent to which}} this is attributable to medication and dopamine (DA) function remains largely unexplored. Methods: We describe here the putative influence of 1) the dose of antipsychotic medication (chlorpromazine equivalents, CPZ), 2) the antipsychotic serum concentration (neuroleptic units in terms of butyrophenone displacement from animal neostriatum) and 3) the approximated DA D 2 -receptor occupancy in the brain (based on regression curves from 11 studies published for 5 neuroleptics) - - on conditioned blocking (CB) measures of attention and performance on a neuropsycholog-ical battery. We studied 108 patients with schizophrenia with 62 healthy controls. Results: 1) Antipsychotic serum concentration and D 2 -occupancy were higher in patients with a paranoid vs. non-paranoid diagnosis, and in female vs. male patients (independent of symptom severity). 2) Controlling for D 2 -occupancy removed the difference between high CB in paranoid and impaired low CB measures of selective attention in nonparanoid patients. 3) Similar partial correlations for antipsychotic drug dose and serum levels of DA D 2 -blocking activity with performance on the trail-making <b>and</b> <b>picture</b> <b>completion</b> tests (negative) <b>and</b> the block-design test (positive) showed the functional importance of DA-related activity. 4) High estimates of D 2 -occupancy were related to impaired verbal fluency - but - were associated with improved recall of stories, especially in paranoid patients. 5) Non-dopaminergic aspects of medication (i. e. CPZ-dependent but not D 2 -occupancy-associated) impaired verbal recall in males (left-hemisphere function) and non-verbal performance in females (reflecting right hemisphere function). Conclusions: This first study of its kind tentatively imputes a role for DA D 2 -related activity in left frontal (e. g.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate differences in baseline neurocognitive performance between UHR participants with (UHR-P) and without transition to psychosis (UHR-NP) and a healthy control (HC) group and examine neurocognitive predictors of transition over the medium to long term. METHOD: A sample of 325 UHR participants recruited consecutively from the Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation (PACE) Clinic in Melbourne and 66 HCs completed a neurocognitive assessment at baseline. The UHR group was followed up between 2. 39 and 14. 86 (median = 6. 45) years later. Cox regression was used to investigate candidate neurocognitive predictors of psychosis onset. RESULTS: The UHR group performed more poorly than the HC group across a range of neurocognitive domains but only performance on digit symbol coding <b>and</b> <b>picture</b> <b>completion</b> differed between the groups. The risk of transition was only significantly associated with poorer performance on visual reproduction [hazard ratio (HR) 0. 919, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 876 - 0. 965, p = 0. 001] and matrix reasoning (HR 0. 938, 95 % CI 0. 883 - 0. 996, p = 0. 037). These remained significant even after controlling for psychopathology at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the longest follow-up of an UHR sample to date. UHR status was associated with poorer neurocognitive performance compared to HCs on some tasks. Cognition at identification as UHR was not a strong predictor of risk for transition to psychosis.

Although the commonly observed age differences {{on these two}} performance tests of intelligence were obtained, {{the size of the}} stimuli did not influence the test scores of either younger or older adults. It would appear that visual acuity does not contribute in a significant way to the classic pattern of age-related deficits in perceptual-integrative intelligence...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Agrammatism is a {{phenomenon}} of neuropsychological relevance which has been recently investigated from conceptual and empirical aspects. The present study focuses on grammatical deficit in agrammatic aphasia. We evaluated the impairment of correct use of tenses of Persian verbs in agrammatic Broca's aphasia. Methods: Eight patients (mean age 57 years) participated in this descriptive - analytic study. They were classified as agrammatic Broca's aphasia according to the Persian aphasia test, their CT Scan and MRI reports and other inclusion criteria. All patients but one were monolingual native speakers of Persian (Farsi). The other individual was bilingual whose dominant language was Persian. All subjects had a left unilateral brain lesion {{for at least one}} year after the onset of brain damage. The written sentence <b>completion</b> <b>and</b> <b>picture</b> sentence <b>completion</b> tests were designed and performed. Results: Results do not indicate significant difference between Past Tenses of verb; however, comparison of means showed best scores in Simple Past, Past Continuous, Present Perfect and Past Perfect, respectively. A main result of this study was significant difference between the mean of responses to Past Tense in comparison with Present Tense and Future (p= 0. 02). Conclusion: Use of tense is impaired in agrammatic Broca's aphasia in Persian. Our findings point out that use of Past Tense is impaired significantly more than the other tenses of verb...|$|R

First, we summarize research findings from three bodies of literature that informed {{the design of the}} software: reading <b>comprehension</b> <b>and</b> deaf children, the role of visual displays in reading <b>comprehension</b> <b>and</b> multimedia learning theories. In the following part, we describe the software "See and See" and explain how relevant theory and research regarding visual displays and multimedia learning has been applied to its design.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, {{there has been a}} growing {{interest}} {{in the study of the}} development of executive functions in preschool children due to their relationship with different cognitive, psychological, social and academic domains. Early detection of individual differences in executive functioning can have major implications for basic and applied research. Consequently, there is a key need for assessment tools adapted to preschool skills: Shape School has been shown to be a suitable task for this purpose. Our study uses Shape School as the main task to analyze development of inhibition, task-switching and working memory in a sample of 304 preschoolers (age range 3. 25 - 6. 50 years). Additionally, we include cognitive tasks for the evaluation of verbal variables (vocabulary, word reasoning and short-term memory) <b>and</b> performance variables (<b>picture</b> <b>completion</b> <b>and</b> symbol search), so as to analyze their relationship with executive functions. Our results show age-associated improvements in executive functions and the cognitive variables assessed. Furthermore, correlation analyses reveal positive relationships between executive functions and the other cognitive variables. More specifically, using structural equation modeling and including age direct and indirect effects, our results suggest that executive functions explain to a greater extent performance on verbal and performance tasks. These findings provide further information to support research that considers preschool age to be a crucial period for the development of executive functions and their relationship with other cognitive processe...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} potential gender and socio-economic status bias in theWechler Intelligence Scale for Children: Fourth Edition (WISC- 4) by using several differential item functioning detection techniques. In this study, WISC- 4 Turkish standardization test pilot data including 817 children were used. In accordance with the purpose of the study, 315 items were used both in polytomously scored subtests such as Block Design, Similarities, Digit Span, Vocabulary, Letter-Number Sequencing, <b>Comprehension,</b> <b>and</b> dichotomously scored subtests such as Picture Concepts, Matrix Reasoning, <b>Picture</b> <b>Completion,</b> Information, Arithmetic, <b>and</b> Word Reasoning. While Rasch Model, Mantel-Haenszel, and SIBTEST DIF detection techniques were used for dichotomously scored items, Partila Credit Model, Mantel, and Poly-SIBTEST techniques were used for polytomously scored items. In terms of DIF techniques, Mantel-Haenszel, SIBTEST and Mantel Test, Poly-SIBTEST analyses provided similar results when DIF based on gender was investigated. In addition Mantel-Haenszel, Rasch estimations and Partial Credit Model, Mantel Test results were similar while investigating DIF according to socioeconomic status...|$|R
40|$|Ninety-one normal Canadian children, {{screened}} for absence {{of emotional and}} educational disabilities, were tested on the wisc-R and examined for significant subtest variability. Arithmetic, Digit Recall, <b>Comprehension,</b> <b>and</b> Coding differed significantly from the grand mean of all subtests. In a second analysis, subtest variability was examined relative to examinee sex, age, and overall IQ. Sex differences occurred on Information, <b>Picture</b> <b>Completion,</b> Arithmetic, Coding, <b>and</b> Digit Recall. Age differences occurred on Information and (marginally) on Performance IQ. Sex and Age interacted on performance IQ, and Sex and IQ interacted on Coding. Based on these differences, {{it is suggested that}} the absence of sex-specific norms and separate norms for Canadian children may lessen the clinical interpretability of subtest differences on the WISC-R. Since its publication in 1974, the Revised Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-R) has received wide acclaim as an improved instrument for evaluating the intelligence of children. The WISC-R is also considered by some authors, on the basis of scatter and of recategorization of subtest scores, to be an untapped source in its potential for diagnosing reading and learning disabilities (Kaufman, 1975...|$|R
