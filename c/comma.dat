5|$|With {{the third}} edition of Erasmus's Greek text (1522) the <b>Comma</b> Johanneum was included. An often {{repeated}} {{story is that}} Erasmus included it, because he felt bound by a promise to include it if a manuscript was found that contained it. When a single 16th-century Greek manuscript subsequently had been found to contain it (Codex Montfortianus), Erasmus included it, though he expressed doubt as to {{the authenticity of the}} passage in his Annotations. Henk Jan de Jonge, a specialist in Erasmian studies, stated that there is no explicit evidence that supports this frequently made assertion concerning a specific promise made by Erasmus. The real reason to include the <b>Comma</b> by Erasmus, was his care for his good name and for the success of his Novum Testamentum.|$|E
5|$|A {{convenient}} {{means of}} determining {{the order of a}} given sigmatropic rearrangement is to number the atoms of the bond being broken as atom 1, and then count the atoms in each direction from the broken bond to the atoms that form the new σ-bond in the product, numbering consecutively. The numbers that correspond to the atoms forming the new bond are then separated by a <b>comma</b> and placed within brackets to create the sigmatropic reaction order descriptor.|$|E

5|$|Another {{attack was}} made in 1521 by Paulus Bombasius, the prefect of the Vatican Library, because in Greek text Erasmus {{departed}} from the common readings of the Vulgate. He informed Erasmus that in the Vatican Library is held an extremely ancient copy of the Scriptures (i.e. Codex Vaticanus). He sent two extracts from this manuscript containing 1 John 4:1-3 and 1 John 5:7-11 (it did not include <b>Comma).</b>|$|E

In mature extratropical cyclones, an area known as the <b>comma</b> head on the northwest periphery of the surface low can be a region of heavy precipitation, frequent thunderstorms, and thundersnows. Cyclones tend to move along a predictable path at a moderate rate of progress. During fall, winter, and spring, the atmosphere over continents can be cold enough through the depth of the troposphere to cause snowfall.|$|E

5|$|López de Zúñiga, {{known as}} Stunica, {{one of the}} editors of Ximenes Complutensian Polyglot, reproached Erasmus that his text lacked part of the 1 John 5:7-8 (<b>Comma</b> Johanneum).

In 1520 Edward Lee accused Erasmus of encouraging Arianism. Erasmus replied that he had not found any Greek manuscript that contained these words, he answered that this was a case not of omission, but simply of non-addition. He showed that even some Latin manuscripts did not contain these words.|$|E

5|$|Mathematics {{were also}} used in musical tuning and music theory. The 2nd-century-BCE Huainanzi, {{compiled}} by eight scholars under the patronage of King Liu An (179–122 BCE), outlined the use of twelve tones on a musical scale. Jing Fang (78–37 BCE), a mathematician and music theorist, expanded these to create a scale of 60 tones. While doing so, Jing Fang realized that 53 just fifths is approximate to 31 octaves. By calculating the difference at 177147⁄176776, Jing reached the same value of 53 equal temperament duly discovered by the German mathematician Nicholas Mercator (1620–1687) (i.e. 353/284, known as Mercator's <b>comma).</b> Later, the prince Zhu Zaiyu (1536–1611 CE) in Ming China and Simon Stevin (1548–1620 CE) of the Flemish Region in Europe would simultaneously (but separately) discover the mathematical formula for equal temperament.|$|E

5|$|In the 16th century Western {{scholars}} {{became aware}} of the manuscript {{as a consequence of the}} correspondence between Erasmus and the prefects of the Vatican Library, successively Paulus Bombasius, and Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda. In 1521, Bombasius was consulted by Erasmus as to whether the Codex Vaticanus contained the <b>Comma</b> Johanneum, and Bombasius supplied a transcript of 1 John 4:1–3 and 1 John 5:7–11 to show that it did not. Sepúlveda in 1533 cross-checked all places where Erasmus's New Testament (the Textus Receptus) differed from the Vulgate, and supplied Erasmus with 365 readings where the Codex Vaticanus supported the latter, although the list of these 365 readings has been lost. Consequently, the Codex Vaticanus acquired the reputation of being an old Greek manuscript that agreed with the Vulgate rather than with the Textus Receptus. Not until much later would scholars realise it conformed to a text that differed from both the Vulgate and the Textus Receptus – a text that could also be found in other known early Greek manuscripts, such as the Codex Regius (L), housed in the French Royal Library (now Bibliothèque nationale de France).|$|E
5|$|The storm {{maintained}} a well-organized structure and banding features over land, {{while continuing to}} produce winds of tropical storm force as it moved into Georgia. Early on June 14, the storm weakened to tropical depression status while located {{near the city of}} Millen, Georgia. Alberto began to lose tropical characteristics soon thereafter, and about six hours after weakening to a tropical depression it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Late on June 14 it accelerated northeastward to emerge into the Atlantic Ocean, and on June 15, it entered the area of responsibility of the Canadian Hurricane Centre. While over open waters, Alberto's remnants began to re-intensify; later that day, the extratropical remnant low attained winds of 65mph (105km/h) and a pressure of 969mbar while a short distance south of Nova Scotia. At this time, the low presented a well-defined <b>comma</b> structure. After passing near Sable Island, the remnants of Alberto crossed the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland on June 16. The extratropical storm turned to the east-northeast and later to the east as it continued its rapid forward motion, and on June 19 the remnants of Alberto merged with an approaching cold front near the British Isles.|$|E

25|$|Appositions are {{separated}} from the referred element with a <b>comma</b> (or a colon), {{if they are in}} the same grammatical position as the referred element. If the apposition gets further back in the sentence, the <b>comma</b> will precede it directly. If the apposition is followed by a pause in speech, a <b>comma</b> may be placed after it, too. If a descriptive phrase is added to a personal name but only the last part takes the suffixes (in which case it is not called an apposition), no <b>comma</b> is used after the personal name. For example: Nagy Elemérnek, városunk díszpolgárának ‘to Elemér Nagy, honorary citizen of our town’ – because of the possessive structure, both element take the suffixes, and the second part can only be an apposition, so a <b>comma</b> is needed. On the other hand: Nagy Elemér díszpolgárnak ‘to Elemér Nagy honorary citizen’ – the whole structure takes one suffix at the very end, thus it cannot be appositive, and no <b>comma</b> is used. If the apposition or the referred element is a derivative of the word maga (“himself” etc.), the <b>comma</b> is not used. However, adverbs used like appositions take the <b>comma.</b>|$|E
25|$|Subordinated clause {{elements}} take no <b>comma</b> (e.g. fekete szemüveges férfi ‘a {{man with}} black glasses’ – the word fekete ‘black’ doesn’t belong to férfi ‘man’ but to szemüveg ‘glasses’). If the word mint ‘as’ precedes a phrase expressing status or quality, no <b>comma</b> is used before it (e.g. Bátyámat mint tanút hallgatták ki. ‘My brother was heard as a witness.’) Structures formed with an adverbial participle {{are not usually}} separated from the clause with a <b>comma,</b> especially if the participle is directly connected to it. However, if this part is loosely attached to the clause (especially if the participle has its own complement), it is recommended to use a <b>comma.</b>|$|E

60|$|In all {{editorial}} {{notes the}} titles given by Wordsworth to his Poems are invariably printed in italics, not with inverted <b>commas</b> before and after, as Wordsworth himself so often printed them: {{and when he}} gave no title to a poem, its first line will be invariably placed within inverted <b>commas.</b> This plan of using Italics, and not Roman letters, applies also to the title of any book referred to by Wordsworth, or by his sister in her Journals. Whether they put the title in italics, or within <b>commas,</b> it is always italicised in this edition.|$|R
25|$|Similes {{introduced}} {{with the}} word mint ‘as, like’ are to be preceded by a <b>comma.</b> The exception {{is a kind of}} a ‘more than’ construction that has a mere intensifying function (as opposed to ‘practically’ or ‘almost’). In case of a double conjunction expressing ‘instead of (doing)’, ‘without (doing)’ etc., only the first element should be preceded by a <b>comma</b> – except if the first element closely belongs to the first clause, in which case the <b>comma</b> is placed between the two conjunctions.|$|E
