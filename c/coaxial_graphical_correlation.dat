During production, gas flow rate and reservoir pressure decrease sharply; and in the shut-in period, reservoir pressure builds up slowly.

Static data and dynamic performance show permeability capacity, kh is the most sensitive factor influencing well productivity, so criteria based on kh were proposed to classify vertical wells. All gas wells were classified into 4 groups.

The absorbance of DR 12 B was measured spectrophotometrically at λmax= 523 nm before and after adsorption of DR 12 B. The maximum removal was 99. 8 % for 30 mg L – 1 of DR 12 B concentration on 0. 3 gr HS adsorbent. Acidic pH was favourable for the adsorption of DR 12 B.

One major technique for improving the quality of steel is to reduce its sulphur content.

Desulphurization of steel at ladle furnace depends on temperature, amount of oxygen and sulphur in the steel, but mainly on chemical composition and physical properties of slag.

This study was conducted to evaluate, through meta-analysis, the individual and the combined effects of mycotoxins on pig performance. The meta-analysis followed three sequential analyses (<b>graphical,</b> <b>correlation,</b> and variance-covariance) based on a database composed of 85 published papers, 1, 012 treatments and 13, 196 animals. Contamination of diets with individual mycotoxins reduced (p < 0. 05) feed intake by 14 % and weight gain by 17 %, while combined mycotoxins reduced the same responses by 42 % and 45 %, respectively, in comparison with the non-challenged group. The correlation (p < 0. 05) between reduction in weight gain (&# 916;G) and reduction in feed intake (&# 916;FI) was 0. 67 in individual challenges and 0. 93 in combined challenges. The estimated &# 916;G was &# 8211; 6 % in individual challenges and &# 8211; 7 % in combined challenges when &# 916;FI was zero, suggesting an increase in the maintenance requirements of challenged animals.

40|$|To {{correlate}} {{the burgeoning}} volume of biostratigraphic information {{available from the}} Silurian rocks of Baltica, it is advantageous to use numerical algorithms. <b>Graphical</b> <b>correlation</b> and related numerical methods routinely incorporate taxon range-ends and bentonites. Bentonites must be matched exactly. Local taxon ranges match or under-represent true ranges and may be stretched to fit hypotheses of correlation. Carbon isotope excursions are better handled as conservative uncertainty intervals – a new data class with properties and freedoms that are the opposite of taxon ranges. Uncertainty intervals match or over-represent truly correlative segments and inflexion points in the local series of isotopic ratios; they may be shrunk to fit correlations between sections. By these means, three fundamentally different kinds of stratigraphic information may be combined in a mutually supportive fashion without over-stating the precision of any of them. When incorporated as uncertainty intervals, Silurian isotopic excursions improve automated construction of inter-regional, ordinal time-lines of taxon first- and last-appearances at both the coarsest and finest resolution. The known succession of a few named excursions helps to stack relatively brief stratigraphic sections into their correct order in longer time-lines. The limits and details of individual excursions support some of the highest-resolution segments of optimized time-lines of individual taxon originations and extinctions. At intermediate scales, local taxon ranges are the unrivalled information source. For the best results, detailed taxon ranges, bentonite analyses and stable isotope time series {{need to be developed}} from the same rocks as often as possible...|$|R

The present {{paper is}} {{the first of a series}} of three, focused on the results of the {{integrated}} magnetic susceptibility and lithological studies carried out in several lacustrine areas of the Danube Delta, the Razim (Razelm) - Sinoie lagoonal Complex and the Black Sea Littoral Zone. Enviromagnetic fingerprints are recovered from the bottom sediments sampled in dynamic and confined aquatic environments and their intensities are evaluated and compared. Distinguishing features identified between different lakes are clearly reflected by the investigated enviromagnetic parameter (MS). The connection between the MS regime recorded within the lake sediments and the ternary diagrams showing their lithological classification (i. e. mineral-siliciclastic fraction, carbonate fraction and organic matter) is discussed, as well. Besides, several composite models illustrate the correlations between the k values and the main lithological components (i. e. organic/TOC, carbonate/CAR and mineral- iliciclastic/SIL, respectively). On the basis of the magneto-lithological data base obtained for the lake sediments sampled in the 2006 cruises, several correlation coefficients (r) were calculated, e. g. related to k vs TOC, k vs CAR, k vs (TOC+CAR) and k vs SIL. The <b>graphical</b> <b>correlation</b> is also taken into consideration to show and interpret the connection between the enviromagnetic parameter and the lithological characters. Generally, positive (direct) correlations characterise the magnetic susceptibility (MS) vs mineral component (SIL), whereas negative (reverse) correlations define MS vs TOC, as well as MS vs (TOC+CAR). The modern sediments sampled in various deltaic environments stand for high fidelity enviromagnetic archives, which are deciphered within the presented case studies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background An {{increasing}} number of studies use GIS estimates of car travel times to health services, without presenting any evidence that the estimates are representative of real travel times. This investigation compared GIS estimates of travel times with the actual times reported by a sample of 475 cancer patients who had travelled by car to attend clinics at eight hospitals in the North of England. Methods Car travel times were estimated by GIS using the shortest road route between home address and hospital and average speed assumptions. These estimates were compared with reported journey times and straight line distances using <b>graphical,</b> <b>correlation</b> and regression techniques. Results There was a moderately strong association between reported times and estimated travel times (r = 0. 856). Reported travel times were similarly related to straight line distances. Altogether, 50 % of travel time estimates were within five minutes of the time reported by respondents, 77 % were within ten minutes and 90 % were within fifteen minutes. The distribution of over- and under-estimates was symmetrical, but estimated times tended to be longer than reported times with increasing distance from hospital. Almost all respondents rounded their travel time to the nearest five or ten minutes. The reason for many cases of reported journey times exceeding the estimated times was confirmed by respondents' comments as traffic congestion. Conclusion GIS estimates of car travel times were moderately close approximations to reported times. GIS travel time estimates may be superior to reported travel times for modelling purposes because reported times contain errors and can reflect unusual circumstances. Comparison with reported times did not suggest that estimated times were a more sensitive measure than straight line distance. </p...|$|R
