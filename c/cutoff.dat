5|$|A {{secondary}} <b>cutoff</b> {{named the}} Slate Creek or Kinney <b>Cutoff</b> breaks {{from the main}} trail near the Lombard Ferry on the Green River, and meets the Sublette <b>cutoff</b> on Slate Creek Ridge at Emigrant Springs.

5|$|After {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in the Salmon River area of Idaho, a group of immigrants persuaded an Illinois-born trapper and trader named Tim Goodale to lead them through the <b>cutoff.</b> A large wagon train left in July 1862 and met up with more wagons at Craters of the Moon Lava Field. Numbering 795 men and 300 women and children, the unusually large group was relatively unmolested during its journey and named the <b>cutoff</b> for their guide. Improvements to the <b>cutoff</b> such as adding a ferry to cross the Snake River made it into a popular alternative route of the Oregon Trail.|$|E

5|$|In 1853, a new route named Seminoe <b>cutoff</b> was {{established}} {{on the southern}} side of the river. It was named after trapper Basil LaJeunesse who {{was referred to as}} Seminoe by the Shoshone Indians. The Seminoe <b>cutoff</b> split from the main trail at the 6th crossing and rejoined it at Burnt Ranch, bypassing both Rocky Ridge and four of the river crossings, which was an advantage in the early spring and summer during high runoff. The route was used extensively in the 1850s, especially by the Mormon companies.|$|E
5|$|Pioneers {{traveling}} in wagon trains on the Oregon Trail in the 1850s and 1860s followed an alternative route {{in the area}} that used old Indian trails that skirted the lava flows. This alternative route was later named Goodale's <b>Cutoff</b> and part of it is {{in the northern part of}} the monument. The <b>cutoff</b> was created to reduce the possibility of ambush by Shoshone warriors along the Snake River such as the one that occurred at Massacre Rocks, which today is memorialized in Idaho's Massacre Rocks State Park.|$|E
5|$|Reed {{was very}} {{impressed}} with this information, and advocated for the Hastings <b>Cutoff.</b> None of the party received Bryant's letters warning them to avoid Hastings' route at all costs; in his diary account, Bryant states his conviction that Bridger deliberately concealed the letters, a view shared by Reed in his later testimony.|$|E
40|$|In this article, we {{consider}} products of ergodic Markov chains and discuss their <b>cutoffs</b> {{in the total}} variation. Through a new inequality relating the total variation and the Hellinger distance, we may identify the total variation <b>cutoffs</b> with <b>cutoffs</b> in the Hellinger distance. This provides a new scheme to study the total variation mixing of Markov chains, in particular, product chains. In the theoretical framework, a series of criteria are introduced to examine <b>cutoffs</b> and a comparison of mixing between the product chain and its coordinate chains is made in detail. For illustration, {{we consider}} products of two-state chains, cycles and other typical examples...|$|R

5|$|A new {{station was}} built in 1897, {{slightly}} to the southeast, behind the Lovell Block. In 1927, the Fitchburg <b>Cutoff</b> became freight-only between the Alewife area and Somerville Junction. Passenger trains from the Lexington Branch and the Central Massachusetts Railroad were diverted to the Fitchburg mainline and began to stop at Cambridge station. In 1937, the Boston and Maine Railroad built a two-story brick depot by the bridge, with the ticket office at street level and the waiting room and platforms below.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} {{starts with}} the canonical quantization procedures of quantum theory. Using the initial-value-formulation of general relativity (cf. evolution equations above), {{the result is the}} Wheeler–deWitt equation (an analogue of the Schrödinger equation) which, regrettably, turns out to be ill-defined without a proper ultraviolet (lattice) <b>cutoff.</b> However, with the introduction of what are now known as Ashtekar variables, this leads to a promising model known as loop quantum gravity. Space is represented by a web-like structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that for a square {{cylinder}} subjected to uniform flow, the drag force changes with the shape of corner <b>cutoffs.</b> To clarify the flow characteristics around a square cylinder with corner <b>cutoffs</b> we measured the drag coefficient and the Strouhal number for changing chamfer shape and dimensions. We analyzed the flow around a square cylinder with corner <b>cutoffs</b> by applying the RNG k–ε turbulent model, and investigated the surface flow pattern using visualization {{by means of the}} oil-film and mist flow method. From these results, we obtained the surface flow patterns by the oil-film method and numerical analysis. The drag coefficient of the square cylinder with corner <b>cutoffs</b> decreased suddenly at an angle of attack of about α = 0 ~ 10 ° when compared with the drag coefficient for a square cylinder. The minimum value of the drag coefficient for the square cylinder with corner <b>cutoffs</b> decreased by about 30 % compared with that for the square cylinder. The drag coefficient of the square cylinder with 10 % corner <b>cutoffs</b> was found to be smallest, since the wake area of this square cylinder was smaller compared with that of the other square cylinder...|$|R

5|$|Continuing toward Fort Bridger {{from the}} Green River, the main trail crosses Hams Fork near Granger and {{followed}} Blacks Fork to Fort Bridger. Established in 1842 by legendary frontiersman Jim Bridger {{and his partner}} Louis Vasquez, Fort Bridger was a vital refueling post and a welcome rest after the particularly difficult journey from South Pass. Even after the Sublette <b>cutoff</b> was established, settlers destined for Oregon who were low on livestock and supplies would bypass the cutoffs and make the longer trip to Fort Bridger to restock. Fort Bridger is {{the point at which}} the Mormon Trail splits from the Oregon Trail and California Trail for good. The Mormon Trail continues southwest, fording the Bear River and crossing into Utah south of the current town of Evanston. The other trails turn and proceed northwest, crossing the Bear River Divide and into the Bear River valley on the western side of the state. The trail meets the Sublette <b>cutoff</b> near Cokeville and the rejoined trails follow the Bear River upstream and into Idaho, heading for Fort Hall.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of phenomenological models of quantum gravity, it is claimed that the {{ultraviolet}} and infrared natural <b>cutoffs</b> can be realized from local deformations of the Hamiltonian systems. In this paper, we scrutinize this hypothesis and formulate a cutoff-regularized Hamiltonian system. The results show that while local deformations are necessary to have <b>cutoffs,</b> they are not sufficient. In fact, the <b>cutoffs</b> can be realized from globally-deformed Hamiltonian systems that are defined on compact symplectic manifolds. By taking the universality of quantum gravity effects into account, we then conclude that quantum gravity <b>cutoffs</b> are global (topological) properties of the symplectic manifolds. We justify our results by considering three well-known examples: The Moyal, Snyder and polymer deformed Hamiltonian systems. Comment: 17 pages, Revised Versio...|$|R

40|$|By {{numerical}} {{solution of the}} time-dependent Schrödinger equation, highly accurate electron spectra are calculated for strong-field ionization of a one-dimensional H 2 + molecular ion at large internuclear distances. Compared to the atomic spectra, we find additional <b>cutoffs</b> at high electron energies. The classical model for ionization (simple-man's model) adapted to the molecular geometry predicts <b>cutoffs</b> up to 50 Up, where Up is the ponderomotive potential. The <b>cutoffs</b> correspond to various scattering scenarios of the tunneled electron from the molecular sites. For certain internuclear distances the agreement between the classical predictions and the numerical spectra is unsatisfactory. We propose a modified simple-man's model based on complex electron trajectories, allowing for electrons appearing in the continuum with nonzero initial velocity from the tunneling ionization process. Agreement of the resulting <b>cutoffs</b> with the numerical results is recovered...|$|R

40|$|For {{percentage}} {{of body fat}} (%BF), there are no internationally accepted <b>cutoffs.</b> The primary function of body fat <b>cutoffs</b> should be to identify not only excessive body fatness, but also the increased risk of unhealthy outcomes, such as hypertension. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze the accuracy of different %BF and body mass index (BMI) <b>cutoffs</b> as screening measures for EBP in pediatric populations. It was a cross-sectional study with a sample of 358 male subjects from 8 to 18 years old. BP was measured by the oscilometric method, and body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The accuracy of three reference tables used for body fat <b>cutoffs</b> was assessed. The three body fat reference tables were highly specific, but insensitive, for elevated BP screening. For elevated BP screening, all body fat <b>cutoffs</b> presented similar sensitivity (range= 48. 3 - 53. 7 %) and specificity (range= 79. 2 - 84. 1 %). The body fat <b>cutoffs</b> performed no better than BMI in screening of children and adolescents at risk of elevated BP (EBP). BMI seems a more attractive tool for this function, as it performed similarly and can be applied in large surveys and with lower costs.
