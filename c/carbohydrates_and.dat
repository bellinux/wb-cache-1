40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of obesity, {{insulin resistance}} and {{type 2 diabetes}} {{can be traced to}} impaired <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>and</b> lipid metabolism. <b>Carbohydrate</b> <b>and</b> lipid metabolism heavily depend on the mitochondria, which itself is regulated by NRF- 1. These metabolic pathways are controlled through the metabolic alterations in concentrations of high energy compounds such as the AMP/ATP and the NAD+ /NADH ratios. Decreased concentrations of ATP are able to activate AMPK which in turn activate a versatile transcription factor, NRF- 1. The function of NRF- 1 is to regulate both <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>and</b> lipid metabolism. On the other hand, changes in the NAD+ /NADH ratios affect the activity of other metabolic regulators such as the protein deacetylases called sirtuins. It has been established that sirtuins can increase the activity of the transcriptional coactivator, PGC- 1, through deacetylation, the main coactivator of NRF- 1. It has however not yet been established whether sirtuins can directly regulate the activity of NRF- 1.

5|$|In {{the great}} {{majority}} of cells, smooth ER regions are scarce and are often partly smooth and partly rough. They are sometimes called transitional ER because they contain ER exit sites from which transport vesicles carrying newly synthesized proteins and lipids bud off for transport to the Golgi apparatus.

The smooth ER of these specialized cells functions in diverse metabolic processes, including synthesis of lipids, metabolism of <b>carbohydrates,</b> <b>and</b> detoxification of drugs and poisons.|$|E

40|$|Reproductive {{success in}} higher plants {{requires}} a lot of energy and substance provided by <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>and</b> protein metabolism, and potassium (K) {{plays an important role in}} <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>and</b> protein metabolism. However, it is unclear whether K deficiency limits reproductive success by disturbing <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>and</b> protein metabolism. The objectives of this study were to explore the effects of K deficiency on <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>and</b> protein metabolism in subtending leaves, phloem and pistils, and their relationship with reproductive success. A cotton cultivar DP 0912 was grown in K-deficient (0 mM K+) and K-sufficient (6 mM K+) nutrient solution in growth chambers. Results showed that Pn of the subtending leaves was decreased under K deficiency, but sucrose, starch and free amino acid contents were markedly increased in the K-deficient leaves, because K deficiency limited the translocation of sucrose and amino acid in phloem. As a result, sucrose and free amino acid contents were reduced by 47. 3 % and 51. 8 % in the K-deficient pistils than K-sufficient pistils, which led to further decreases in starch and protein accumulation in the K-deficient pistils. Glucose content was also reduced by 53. 1 % in the K-deficient pistils than K-sufficient pistils, due to the decreased acid and alkaline invertase activities, since sucrose synthase activity was not affected. Lastly, soluble <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>and</b> ATP contents were lower in the K-deficient pistils than K-sufficient pistils, similarly to the changes of pollen tube growth rate and seed set efficiency. It was concluded that the lower <b>carbohydrate</b> <b>and</b> ATP contents in the K-deficient pistils could not meet the energy requirements of pollen tube growth and seed set. Moreover, protein imbalance also limited pollen tube growth. Those changes resulted in lower seed set efficiency to limit reproductive successauthorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
