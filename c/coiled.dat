5|$|There {{are several}} {{arguments}} behind {{an association of}} the chitinozoans with annelids or gastropods, {{and it is not}} impossible that the chitinozoans are a convergent phenomenon laid by both groups. In fact, the spirally <b>coiled</b> nature of chitinozoan chains has been used to suggest that they were laid by a spirally <b>coiled</b> organism, such as the gastropods; were this inference true, uncoiled chains could be to be attributed to the (straight) annelid worms or other organisms.|$|E

Despite {{the evolution of}} <b>coil</b> coating technologies to encourage aneurysmal occlusion, the results were disappointing. Randomized controlled trials testing Cerecyte <b>coils</b> versus bare platinum <b>coils</b> and hydrogel-coated <b>coils</b> versus bare platinum showed no additional benefit over bare platinum <b>coils</b> regarding primary outcome (recurrence was lower in hydrogel <b>coil</b> group) [10, 11]. Piotin and his colleagues found that polyglycolic-lactic acid (PGLA)-coated <b>coils</b> (Matrix <b>coils)</b> did not show better recanalization rates than bare platinum <b>coils</b> during long-term follow-up [7, 12]. Angiographic outcome of cerebral aneurysms treated by endovascular <b>coiling</b> was not affected by approved <b>coil</b> type used [13].

In practical cases, receiving <b>coils</b> might be not only one, or not convenient to get a low-temperature environment, or not in the same sizes with the transmitting <b>coil.</b> Thus, we constructed a WPT system from one HTS <b>coil</b> to two copper <b>coils,</b> and one of the copper receiving <b>coils</b> had a different size from the HTS transmitting <b>coil.</b> In addition, we placed one HTS relaying <b>coil</b> between the transmitting <b>coil</b> and the receiving <b>coils</b> {{to increase the efficiency}} and the distance. Based on this system, we conducted several experiments and analyzed the results. We found that a denser <b>coil</b> could obtain more power in an HTS WPT system and that WPT from one HTS <b>coil</b> to two copper <b>coils</b> was more efficient than WPT from the same HTS <b>coil</b> to one of the two copper <b>coils.</b> We also demonstrated that an appropriate layout of the HTS relaying <b>coil</b> can increase the HTS WPT efficiency...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the physical characteristics {{and behavior of}} <b>coils</b> for endovascular therapy. METHODS: Mechanically detachable <b>coils</b> were constructed with simple helical (4 mm � 10 cm and 8 mm� 30 cm) and pretzel shapes (4 mm � 5 cm) made from three metals using 0. 003 - and 0. 004 -in wire. Stiffness or pliability, frictional resistance, shape memory, and <b>coil</b> stability were evaluated in vitro. RESULTS: The 0. 004 -in wire stock <b>coils</b> proved significantly stiffer {{when compared with the}} 0. 003 -in <b>coils.</b> Tungsten <b>coils</b> proved least pliable; platinum <b>coils</b> were intermediate in stiffness; and nitinol <b>coils</b> were softest. Frictional resistance in the catheter was greatest for stiffer <b>coils.</b> The 5 -cm pretzel <b>coil</b> consistently created more frictional force than the 10 - or 30 -cm simple helical <b>coils.</b> Despite a shorter length, the 4 -mm simple helical <b>coil</b> exerted more frictional force than the 8 -mm <b>coil.</b> Stiffer metal <b>coils</b> constructed of larger-diameter wire (0. 004 in) were more stable than softer <b>coils.</b> CONCLUSION: Stiffer <b>coils</b> exert greater frictional forces within the catheter and a greater resistive force during bending but are more stable after placement. Frictional forces also depended on the complex three-dimensional shape of the <b>coil</b> and the diameter of the turns in that shape rather than <b>coil</b> length. These data suggest that a family of <b>coils</b> of different metals is optimal for varied intravascular needs...|$|R

In the morning and on cool days, they can often be seen basking in the sunlight. They often emerge at sunset to warm themselves on warm ground (i.e., sidewalks, roads) and then become very active throughout the night, when they are usually found swimming or crawling. Contrary to popular belief, they are capable of biting while under water.|$|E

However, during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, African-Americans such as Malcolm X advocated hairstyles such as afros and dreadlocks, in order to embrace their race, and to return to West African roots.|$|E
5|$|Both {{groups have}} a shell {{consisting}} of two valves, but {{the organization of the}} shell is quite different in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are positioned on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, the valves are on the left and right sides of the body, and are, in most cases, mirror images of one other. Brachiopods have a lophophore, a <b>coiled,</b> rigid cartilaginous internal apparatus adapted for filter feeding, a feature shared with two other major groups of marine invertebrates, the bryozoans and the phoronids. Brachiopod shells are often made of calcium phosphate as well as calcium carbonate, whereas bivalve shells are composed entirely of calcium carbonate.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{three-phase}} field excitation switched flux (FESF) motor where both field excitation (FE) <b>coil</b> and armature <b>coil</b> {{placed on the}} stator is investigated. The rotor is design with separately segmental pole so that flux generated from FE <b>Coil</b> can be fundamentally placed in adjacent with flux of armature <b>coil.</b> Thus, the <b>coil</b> end length of both FE <b>Coil</b> and armature <b>coil</b> are reduced, hence increasing the motor efficiency when compared with FESF motor with single piece rotor, and overlapped FE <b>Coil</b> and armature <b>coil</b> windings. In this paper design investigation and analysis of 12 S- 8 P and 24 S- 10 P FESF motor with segmental rotor are investigated. Moreover, <b>coil</b> test analysis, FE <b>Coil</b> flux characteristics, flux interaction between FE <b>Coil</b> and armature <b>coil,</b> flux distribution, and torque characteristics are also compared.

40|$|Metallic {{contaminant}} detectors {{based on}} the balanced <b>coil</b> system are widely used in the food industry. In the balanced <b>coil</b> system, an excitation <b>coil</b> and two identical pickup <b>coils</b> are used {{in a way that}} the magnetic coupling of pickup <b>coils</b> to the excitation <b>coil</b> is cancelled with each other when no metallic contaminants present. In a conventional system, the excitation <b>coil</b> and the pickup <b>coil</b> are planar and are parallel, therefore the magnetic coupling is strong even if there is no metallic contaminant. Such strong magnetic coupling makes balancing procedure tedious. In this paper, we introduce a new <b>coil</b> system in which pickup <b>coils</b> are set orthogonal to the excitation <b>coil,</b> making the magnetic coupling much small compared to conventional counterpart. Pickup <b>coils</b> are equipped with thin magnetic cores and placed inside the excitation <b>coil</b> being parallel to the excitation <b>coil</b> plane. The balancing method consists of two steps; the one is geometrical and the other is digital processing including down conversion.

5|$|Four {{different}} types of male flowers exist. On {{the basis of these}} flower types, the genus has often been split into four genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea. The species sometimes referred to Orbignya have <b>coiled</b> anthers, while the other groups have straight ones. The petals of those placed in Maximiliana are much shorter than the stamens, while those placed in Scheelea and a more narrowly defined Attalea have petals that are longer than the stamens. Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{components}} of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a <b>coiled</b> coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a protofilament. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament. These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in {{the length of the}} filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.|$|E
