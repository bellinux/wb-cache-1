25|$|The Pascack Valley High School Student Government Association {{consists}} of five councils. Each grade has a <b>class</b> <b>council,</b> and the PVHS Executive Council governs the entire student body. Each council {{consists of}} a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and eight elected and appointed representatives. In 1996, two district students, Matt Kracinovich of Pascack Hills, and Ryan Shell of Pascack Valley, successfully lobbied the Board of Education to accept a special student representative from each school {{to sit on the}} board. In the following year, the 1997–1998 school year, Kracinovich and Shell became the first students to occupy the new positions officially known as the Non-Voting Student Members of the Board of Education.|$|E
25|$|At the {{undergraduate}} level, there are separate student governments {{on the two}} campuses. Although the two student governments are separate, they work closely in coordinating joint events. The men's schools are represented overall by the Yeshiva Student Union, and specifically by the Yeshiva College Student Association, the Syms Student Council, the Student Organization of Yeshiva (SOY, which represents both undergraduate MYP {{students as well as}} RIETS students), and student councils for SBMP, IBC, and JSS. The latter four run most Jewish-related activities on campus, including holiday celebrations and the famed SOY Seforim (Jewish book) Sale annually around February, which is open to the general public and attracts large crowds from near and far. There are also individual councils for each <b>class,</b> <b>council</b> committees, a Student Court, and clubs.|$|E
40|$|Democracy {{depends on}} the {{participation}} of citizens. Citizenship education {{is taking place in}} classroom communities to prepare pupils for their role as citizens. <b>Class</b> <b>councils</b> are participatory forms of citizenship education guaranteeing the children’s right to form and express their views freely as written down in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Theoretical deficiencies and empirical objections have been formulated against participation in the school setting. Despite widespread practices, empirical data about <b>class</b> <b>councils</b> in Switzerland barely exists. In our research project we video-recorded fourteen <b>class</b> <b>councils</b> in secondary schools, we interviewed the teacher and four pupils of each class, and all the pupils filled in a standardized questionnaire. <b>Class</b> <b>councils</b> are very popular forms of education with pupils although the actual power to influence decisions by deliberation is doubted to some extent. Quantitative analysis of the video-recordings shows the wide range of forms of <b>class</b> <b>councils</b> that exist in respect to the talking time of the pupils. To express one’s own viewpoint and to understand the standpoint of other discussants, construct arguments and counterarguments, participate, and lead discussions are difficult tasks. Based on the empirical research the project describes three forms of <b>class</b> <b>councils</b> that differ in the degree of favouring the development of communicative competences as a part of citizenship education...|$|R

50|$|Mr. Brown {{left the}} job in 1988 and was succeeded by Mrs. Joan Kendall. Some of the {{highlights}} of Mrs. Kendall's eight-year tenure were improved exam results, refurbishment of school facilities and the establishment of an Environmental Club and <b>Class</b> <b>Councils.</b> These councils were formed to foster better relationships among parents, teachers and students. Apart from ensuring that classrooms were always kept in a clean and tidy manner, <b>Class</b> <b>Councils</b> played a meaningful role in helping to promote the social, academic and moral development of the child. Mrs. Kendall is also credited with restoring the observance of St. Joseph day on March 19, at the school.|$|R
50|$|A {{lower level}} of ASB {{consists}} of the four class councils. Each <b>class</b> <b>council</b> has nine members, with the class president also being part of ASB. Much like ASB, students must run for election to class councils. A <b>class</b> <b>council</b> candidate speaks {{in front of the}} class. Most students who are on ASB started as a <b>class</b> <b>council</b> member. Class councils are in charge of class funds, class fundraisers, activities, and Fantastics and Homecoming execution. One must be motivated, spirited, and have a passion for school in order to be on ASB or <b>class</b> <b>council.</b> One notable exception, however, is Vincent Le ('16) who somehow made it onto council despite never attending any school events.|$|E

Each <b>class</b> <b>council</b> has their own budget, amounting to roughly $70,000 over 4 years (as of 2017). These budgets (as well as the graduate council budget) are the only budgets in the Rensselaer Student Union that the executive board does not control, due to the uncertainty for spending {{in the nature of}} class councils. The purpose of a <b>class</b> <b>council</b> is to continue the tradition of the class that they represent: the class tree, class quote, and the class gift are hallmark traditions as well as the senior week. The purpose of the core Undergraduate Council is for internal checks-and-balances on the all the councils with all decisions needing a 3/4th majority, as well as a knowledge source for past decisions.|$|E
