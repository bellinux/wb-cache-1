30|$|Sleeping {{difficulties}} {{are associated with}} child behavioral and emotional problems (Meltzer, 2010; Moore, 2010). Several studies (Blunden & <b>Chervin,</b> 2008; Blunden & <b>Chervin,</b> 2010; Byars, Yeomans-Maldonado, & Noll, 2011; Cortesi, Giannotti & Ottaviano, 1999; Hall, Zubrick, Silburn, Parsons, & Kurinczuk, 2007; Rafihi-Ferreira, Silvares, Pires, Assumpção-Jr, & Moura, 2016; Scher, Zukerman, & Epstein, 2005; Stein, Mendelsohn, Obermeyer, Amromin, & Benca, 2001), in which the association between sleep quality and behavioral problems was investigated, demonstrated a relationship between externalizing and internalizing problems and sleep problems in children. This association, as concerning as it is, becomes even more serious when considering that childhood sleep problems may persist and that they constitute a greater risk for other behavioral problems. These empirical relationships, already identified in certain longitudinal studies (Gregory, Ende, Willis, & Verhulst, 2008; Hall et al., 2007; Scher et al., 2005), indicate the importance of intervening {{as soon as possible}} in order to prevent the persistence of sleep problems over the years from becoming strongly associated with other behavioral problems such as anxiety, depression, and aggression.|$|E
30|$|The use of {{decision}} analytics {{would also help}} to produce screening instruments better targeted to sectors of the population such as woman. Currently there is no questionnaire that targets women for the prediction of obstructive sleep apnoea (Yukawa et al. 2009). There {{have been a number}} of studies (<b>Chervin</b> 2000; Shepertycky et al. 2005; Smith et al. 2002; Yukawa et al. 2009) showing that women present differently to a clinician with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea. Both the symptoms of depression and obstructive sleep apnoea can be described as sleepiness, fatigue, tiredness and lack of energy, so there is an overlap between these disorders however most clinicians expect extreme daytime sleepiness to be the overriding symptom of obstructive sleep apnoea (<b>Chervin</b> 2000). However the words that women use to describe their symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea are more likely to be fatigue, tiredness and lack of energy leading primary care physicians to look for a diagnosis such as depression (<b>Chervin</b> 2000). Shepertycky et al. (2005) state that approximately 90 % of women with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed leading to significant health impacts and costs to the health system. As obstructive sleep apnoea contributes to disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease and depression, medical costs in patients before a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea are higher than those in a control group as these comorbid conditions prove more resistant to treatment (Smith et al. 2002). Women who receive a diagnosis of depression before a subsequent diagnosis of obstructive sleep disorder are more likely to be treated by drugs for depression rather than psychoanalysis and may not suffer from depression at all. The managerial implications is that misdiagnosed woman with obstructive sleep apnoea will tend to have more time of work and have lower work performance than woman with a treated sleep disorder.|$|E

This was demonstrated in {{the results of the}} present study, corroborating with previous studies with a randomized design. Pinilla and Birch (1993) assessed the child’s temperament using the Bate’s Infant Characteristics Questionnaire, and, in comparison with the control group, the results for sleep problems showed that after the intervention, the parents reported that their children’s behavior was more predictable, to the extent that parents had greater control over their children. Seymour, Brock, During, and Poole (1989) found that 73 % of parents reported positive changes in their children’s daytime behavior after undergoing behavioral therapy for insomnia.|$|E
40|$|International audienceNew {{high-resolution}} Brillouin scattering {{experiments are}} performed under hydrostatic pressures ranging from 0 to 10 GPa in vitreous silica. The hypersound-attenuation coefficient exhibits a sharp maximum located at 2 GPa, {{which appears to}} coincide with the well-known minimum in sound velocity. Two main processes contribute to sound damping: the thermal relaxation of local defects and the anharmonic interactions with thermal vibrations. By analyzing the temperature dependence of the velocity and subtracting the changes produced by the above mechanisms, the unrelaxed velocity is found. It is constant at low temperatures and increases anomalously above a temperature onset. We show that the onset strongly depends on pressure, which is in agreement with a dynamical origin of the structural changes that produce the hardening. Reference: S. Ayrinhac, B. Rufflé, M.

This paper investigates the problem of model variability by analyzing the mean and the eddy kinetic energy from the model and comparing the values with the Geosat altimeter observations for the South Atlantic Ocean and for the Kuroshio system. It is found that, while the model shows transient eddy activity in the areas that overlap the Geosat observations, the energy level of the model transient motions is considerably smaller following an arch along the bottom topography. The same was found from the comparisons made with values obtained from FGGE and surface drifters. It is suggested that the model is poorly resolving instabilities in the confluence front, and is not resolving other transients appearing in regions of marked topography...|$|E

40|$|The current {{generation}} of ocean general circulation models (OGCMS) uses a convective adjustment scheme to remove static instabilities and to parameterize shallow and deep convection. In simulations used to examine climate-related scenarios, investigators found that in the Arctic regions, the OGCM simulations did not produce a realistic vertical density structure, did not create the correct quantity of deep water, and did not use a time-scale of adjustment that is in agreement with tracer ages or observations. A possible weakness of the models is that the convective adjustment scheme does not represent the process of deep convection adequately. Consequently, a penetrative plume mixing scheme has been developed to parameterize the process of deep open-ocean convection in OGCMS. This new deep convection parameterization was incorporated into the Semtner and <b>Chervin</b> (1988) OGCM. The modified model (with the new parameterization) was run in a simplified Nordic Seas test basin: under a cyclonic wind stress and cooling, stratification of the basin-scale gyre is eroded and deep mixing occurs {{in the center of}} the gyre. In contrast, in the OGCM experiment that uses the standard convective adjustment algorithm, mixing is delayed and is wide-spread over the gyre...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that low doses of ethanol stimulate the {{maturation}} of some fruits. The present work showed that spraying Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, with 5 % ethanol at veraison enhances the anthocyanin accumulation. Veraison is the time when the berries turn from green to purple. HPLC analysis showed a marked increase in the total concentrations of the derivatives of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin and malvidin from the fourth day after the ethanol treatment until harvest. This was not linked to a difference in berry weight in comparison to controls. Two distinct expression patterns were found for anthocyanin biosynthesis genes in the treated and untreated berries. For one group, consisting of chalcone synthase, flavanone- 3 -hydroxylase, dihydroxyflavonol- 4 -reductase and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, the expression was inhibited or unchanged by the ethanol treatment, whereas for UDP glucose-flavonoid 3 -O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) there was a marked increase in expression from 1 to 20 days after ethanol treatment. These results suggest that the UFGT gene is a key factor in the observed anthocyanin accumulation following ethanol treatment.
