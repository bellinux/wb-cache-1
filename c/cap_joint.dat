40|$|Due to its {{potential}} to significantly increase fuel efficiency, the current focus of NASA's Environmentally Responsible Aviation Program is the hybrid wing body (HWB) aircraft. Due to the complex load condition that exists in HWB structure, as compared to traditional aircraft configurations, light-weight, cost-effective and manufacturable structural concepts are required to enable the HWB. The Pultruded Rod Stitched Efficient Unitized Structure (PRSEUS) concept is one such structural concept. A building block approach for technology development of the PRSEUS concept is being conducted. As part of this approach, a PRSEUS pressure cube was developed as a risk reduction test article to examine a new integral <b>cap</b> <b>joint</b> concept. This paper describes the design, analysis and testing of the PRSEUS pressure cube test article. The pressure cube was required to withstand a 2 P, 18. 4 psi, overpressure load requirement. The pristine pressure cube was tested to 2. 2 P with no catastrophic failure. After the addition of barely visible impact damage, the cube was pressure loaded to 48 psi where catastrophic failure occurred, meeting the scale-up requirement. Comparison of pretest and posttest analyses with the cube test response agree well, and indicate that current analysis methods {{can be used to}} accurately analyze PRSEUS structure for initial failure response...|$|E

Material evaluation tests were conducted on two toughened resin composites: Celion/HX 1504 and Celion/ 5245. These consisted of impact, tension, compression, edge delamination, and double cantilever beam tests. Another test series was conducted on graphite/epoxy box beams simulating a wing cover to spar <b>cap</b> <b>joint</b> configuration of a pressurized fuel tank. These tests evaluated the effectiveness of sealing methods with various fastener types and spacings under fatigue loading and with pressurized fuel. Another test series evaluated {{the ability of the}} selected coatings, film, and materials to prevent fuel leakage through 32 -ply AS 4 / 2220 - 1 laminates at various impact energy levels. To verify the structural integrity of the technology demonstration article structural details, tests were conducted on blade stiffened panels and sections. Compression tests were performed on undamaged and impacted stiffened AS 4 / 2220 - 1 panels and smaller element tests to evaluate stiffener pull-off, side load and failsafe properties. Compression tests were also performed on panels subjected to Zone 2 lightning strikes. All of these data were integrated into a demonstration article representing a moderately loaded area of a transport wing.

40|$|As an {{approach}} to light-weight, cost-effective and manufacturable structures required to enable the hybrid wing body aircraft, The Boeing Company, Inc. and NASA have developed the Pultruded Rod Stitched Efficient Unitized Structure (PRSEUS) concept. A PRSEUS pressure cube was developed as a risk reduction test article to examine a new integral <b>cap</b> <b>joint</b> concept {{as part of a}} building block approach for technology development of the PRSEUS concept. The overall specimen strength exceeded the 18. 4 psi load requirement as testing resulted in the cube reaching a final pressure load of around 48 psi prior to catastrophic failure. The cube pressure test verified that the joints and structure were capable of sustaining the required loads, and represented the first testing of joined PRSEUS structure. This paper will address the damage arrestment performance of the stitched PRSEUS structure. Following catastrophic failure of the cube, ultrasonic pulse-echo inspection found that the localized damage, surrounding a barely-visible impact damage site, did not change noticeably between just after impact and catastrophic failure of the cube, and did not {{play a role in the}} catastrophic failure event. Ultrasonic inspection of the remaining intact cube panels presented three basic types of indications: delaminations between laminae parallel to the face sheets, lying between face sheet and tear strap layers, or between tear strap and flange layers; delaminations above the noodles of stringers, frames or integral caps, lying within face sheet or tear strap layers; and delaminations between the laminae in the inner fillets of the integral caps, where pulloff stresses were expected to be highest. Delaminations of all three types were predominantly contained by the first row of stitches encountered. For the small fraction of delaminations extending beyond the first row of stitches, all were contained by the second stitch row...|$|E

40|$|Project (M. S., Civil Engineering (Structural Engineering)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. This report, Development of Preliminary Strut-Tie Models for Precast Bent Cap Connections (Cast-in-place and Grouted Duct), {{develops}} strut-tie models (STM) for precast bent cap-column connections {{using the}} NCHRP 12 - 74 Grouted Duct (GD) and Cast-in-Place (CIP) specimens. In {{development of these}} STM???s, the bent cap bar strains from the specimens were compared against three theoretical models: beam theory, 2 D strut-tie models, and 3 D strut-tie models. 	The beam theory analysis used statics, moment-curvature analysis, and actual material properties of the specimens to determine the theoretical bent cap bar strains. The 2 D STM, based on the modified external strut force transfer model (EFTM) proposed in the literature, was established using the computer aided strut-and-tie (CAST) program. Through an iterative process, a refined 2 D STM was developed for both the push and pull test directions by comparing specimen strain data to CAST output. An important modification to the EFTM-based STM was {{the addition of a}} tension tie at the bottom cap face (as tested) for the pull direction. This corresponded to tension strain present in test data and made the CAST model stable. Based on the 2 D STM, the 3 D STM was created in the SAP 2000 structural analysis program. The 3 D STM incorporates out-of-plane effects related to actual column bar positions and allows a more accurate representation of the two primary mechanisms assumed in anchoring column tension forces: clamping mechanism and splice transfer mechanism. 	The beam theory results included limited comparisons of actual-to-theoretical flexural strains for two locations adjacent to the joint, top vs. bottom bars, and CIP vs. GD specimens. The average percent differences of the actual to the theoretical strains for the CIP was 49 and 146 for the compression bar, 12 inches away from the cap face and at the cap face, respectively. Over the entire range of loading stages, differences in actual-to-theoretical strains were generally larger for locations closer to the joint, indicating a more pronounced local disturbance compared to locations further away from the joint. Bars that were in compression for most of the loading sequences exhibited a much closer match to theoretical strains than bars that were primarily subjected to tension. Local cracking and other effects are believed to have influenced gage readings. CIP and GD strains for the same locations generally displayed similar trends and values, especially for bars in compression. 	Compared to beam theory, results of the 2 D STM analysis indicated a closer correlation between actual and theoretical strain. The difference between actual and theoretical strains for the CIP specimen were limited to 28 percent and averaged approximately 16 percent for both push and pull directions. For the GD specimen, the differences were as large as 44 percent except for one location, which reached a 98 percent difference. On average, the differences averaged 27 percent in the push direction and the 45 percent in the pull direction. This increased accuracy reflects the more realistic representation of the flow of forces within a joint and their effects. 	The 3 D STM showed the closest correlation between the test data and theoretical analysis. Actual to theoretical strains for the 3 D STM???s differed by no more than 42 percent and only 14 percent on average. These values were smaller than for any other analytical method. The reason is because the 3 D mechanisms associated with anchoring the column tension force were more accurately detailed and accounted for in the 3 D model. 	Conclusions from these analyses include: 1) beam theory does not accurately represent strains that develop in longitudinal reinforcement at the face of CIP and precast bent cap joints; 2) the limit of the disturbed (D) region appears to extend a distance of approximately half of the bent cap depth (hb/ 2) {{from the face of the}} joint; 3) the developed 2 D STM, including the additional tension tie, provides a reasonably simple and accurate model for the flow of forces through a bent <b>cap</b> <b>joint</b> using CIP or GD connections; 4) the modified EFTM requires an additional tension tie in the pull direction to accurately represent tension that develops in the exterior face of bent caps; 5) the developed 3 D STM is the most complicated yet accurate model for analyzing joint forces and associated reinforcement strain in a CIP or precast bent cap joint; 6) the presence of ducts in the GD specimen did not noticeably affect specimen strain values compared to the CIP specimen nor affect the development or results of the 2 D or 3 D STM???s; and 7) analytical results from this study do not indicate the need for any changes to existing NCHRP 12 - 74 recommendations for non-integral precast bent caps using CIP or GD connections. 	Based on results of this analysis, the following are recommended for future study: 1) perform finite element analysis (FEA) of the CIP and GD specimens in the pull direction to confirm the need for the additional tension tie; 2) further develop the 2 D STM, with special focus on determination of strains in the joint hoops and joint stirrups (interior and exterior) and comparison to test data; 3) perform FEA for CIP and GD precast bent caps to validate the three splice transfer mechanisms and their impact on joint behavior; and 4) incorporate data from the CSUS Preliminary Grouted Duct specimen to supplement these analytical results.

The 70 -kDa rec 1 protein is most likely a proteolytic degradation product of REC 2, which has a predicted mass of 84 kDa but which runs anomalously during sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis with an apparent mass of 110 kDa. To facilitate purification of the protein product, the REC 2 gene was overexpressed from a vector that fused a hexahistidine leader sequence onto the amino terminus, enabling isolation of the REC 2 protein on an immobilized metal affinity column. The purified protein exhibits ATP-dependent DNA renaturation and DNA-dependent ATPase activities, which were reactions characteristic of the protein as purified from cell extracts of U. maydis.
