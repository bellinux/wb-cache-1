The Commerce Refuse-to-Energy Facility is a 350 ton per day, mass burn waterwall facility that began operation in 1987. Fouling occurs throughout the <b>convection</b> <b>sections</b> with the highest differential pressure occurring across the generating bank. Flue gas differential pressures and temperatures have been tracked and analyzed at the facility for approximately ten years during various operating conditions. It has been determined {{that the rate of}} increase of the differential pressure across the generating bank is correlated with flue gas temperature and the extent of fouling. Several different cleaning methods have been used to clear the convection zone of ash deposits, including off-line hydroblasting, on-line hydroblasting, on-line explosives cleaning, sootblowers and sonic horns [...] Better understanding of the fouling trends and evaluation of cleaning methods has led the facility to use a combination of on-line hydroblasting and explosives cleaning and off-line hydroblasting. The facility is now able to operate one year between planned outages, compared to ten weeks during the initial operation of the facility. Additional savings have also been achieved by reducing induced draft fan load, and possibly a reduction in tube wastage...|$|R

The conversion of naptha to high octane aromatics requires high energy to initiate and sustain the reaction at temperatures of 850 - 950 oF. Hydrogen - rich off - gases are fired in combinations of process furnaces. Heat is transferred to hydrocarbon fluids by radiation, principally.

This paper describes the performance testing and evaluation of a set of ten refinery furnaces used to thermally drive several reforming reactors and to regenerate catalysts. Firing rates provide an input of 216. 2 x 106 Btu/hr. to the furnaces, at $ 1. 90 per 106 Btu. The units are fitted with multiple natural draft burners. There is insufficient turbulence and swirl in the burners. Operators manually set up the burners with excessive airflows for normal, full-load firing. These furnaces represent production limits. Products of combustion exhaust at high thermal levels - the range is from 985 - 1700 oF. The mixed gases flow through a "waste heat" boiler, or they bypass the boiler and enter a single stack. Steam generation at 150 psig averages 38, 200 lb/hr. Heat is wasted via the bypass at a rate of 41. 1 x 106 Btu /hr. at 1240 oF. When airflows are reduced (to 15 % excess air) the loss will be 18. 7 x 106 Btu/hr. at 1180 oF. Installation of a second, parallel waste heat boiler will result in a saving of l 3. 4 x 106 Btu/hr.

40|$|Pulverized {{samples of}} Utah bituminous, Beulah (North Dakota) low Na lignite, Beulah high Na lignite and Texas (San Miguel) lignite coals were burned {{at a rate}} of 2. 5 kg/hr in a {{laboratory}} furnace under various (overall fuel lean) combustion conditions. Particle size distributions (PSD) and size segregated particle filter samples were taken at various positions within the <b>convection</b> <b>section.</b> Temperature and gas concentrations were measured throughout. The evolution of the submicron PSD within the <b>convection</b> <b>section</b> for the four coals was similar, although the location of the initial particle mode at the <b>convection</b> <b>section</b> inlet varied with coal type. While staged (. 8 / 1. 2) combustion of the Utah bituminous coal had a variable effect on the volume of submicron aerosol produced, staged combustion of two of the three lignites (Beulah low Na and Texas) caused a definite increase in the submicron aerosol volume. Vapor enhancement due to a localized reducing atmosphere, which would effect coals of higher ash volatility or higher inherent ash content, is thought to explain this behavior. Depressed combustion temperatures associated with the high moisture content of the Beulah high Na lignite are thought to offset the effects of staging. Increased combustion temperatures (through oxygen enrichment) caused staged volume increases for the Beulah high Na lignite. Combustion temperatures are a controlling factor even at more extreme staging conditions. Chemical analysis of the size segregated particle samples show the trace elements, As, Pb, Zn and the major elements, Na and K to be enriched in the submicron aerosol. Auger depth profiles show these small particles to be comprised of a core enriched in Fe, Si, Ca and Mg and surface layers enriched in Na and K. These results point to a mechanism of homogeneous nucleation of low vapor pressure species followed by successive layering of progressively more volatile species. Volatile species are enriched in the submicron aerosol due to the large surface areas provided. Modeling efforts show that while coagulation may be the dominant mechanism to describe the aerosol evolving within the <b>convection</b> <b>section,</b> it cannot be used solely to predict the PSD. Another mechanism, presumably surface area dependent growth (condensation) must be included...|$|E

40|$|Failure {{investigation}} {{was done on}} a 321 stainless steel charge heater tube which failed in a refinery unit processing heavy crude oil. Crude oil was the charge in the radiant and convection sections; while saturated stripping steam is present in <b>convection</b> <b>section.</b> After a leak was detected, visual inspection revealed that nine convection tubes had black oil/coke deposits on their external surfaces. The deposits were seen on the first three rows of tubes. When one of the tubes was lightly ground at the black colored area, a circumferential crack was visually observed. The investigation revealed that long-term aging, coupled with localized deposition of salts and coke from the heavy crude led to sensitization of the tube surface layers. This in turn resulted in sulphidation of the internal surface grain boundaries, formation of grooves, and cracking of the material. Thus, cracking was intergranular in nature in the initial stage, but became transgranular at later stages.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the problem of deep {{convection}} in the Mediterranean basin with special emphasis on phenomena where convection is linked with larger scale structures. It is commonly recognized that cyclonic structures trigger often convective systems in the Mediterranean, and the interaction between such cloud systems and cyclones has not yet been properly investigated. As a major finding of the EU Project MEFFE (Prodi, 2000), a short term climatology of flood events in Europe has shown that the most severe flood episodes occurring in Europe over recent years were caused by cyclonic systems. In particular, two kind of cyclones have been defined, different in their basic structures: Atlantic and Mediterranean (Porcú et. al., 1997 a). The first class includes events where the depression is at high latitude (above 50 N), presents well defined frontal structures, lasts for several days and produces mainly stratified precipitation. Conversely, Mediterranean cyclones are mainly generated in Southern Europe as a perturbation of a polar front, are usually short lived (about one day) and always develop deep convection. While the first class has been studied extensively and conceptual models describing the main features have been developed and are widely used in the operational forecasting environment (see Browning (1982) for a summary), the study of the Mediterranean class is still at an early stage. Isolated and organized convection has been intensively studied in Europe over the last decade, and it has been seen that Europen convective systems show new features with respect to the well known systems in the U. S. and tropics. Nevertheless, only recently has the close connection between cyclogenesis and deep convection been pointed out. Since such cloud systems develop mainly over the sea, it seems that the extensive use of ground radar must be excluded for such studies: a space-view approach is needed. A review of satellite techniques for studying convection is presented, and some new results of their application to Mediterranean systems are summarized.

40|$|A {{method that}} is based on the initial {{slagging}} routes and the sintered/slagging route has been developed and used for predicting the ash deposition propensities of coal combustion in utility boilers supported by the data collected from power stations. Two types of initial slagging routes are considered, namely (i) pyrite-induced initial slagging on the furnace wall, and (ii) fouling caused by the alkaline/alkali components condensation in the <b>convection</b> <b>section.</b> In addition, the sintered/slagging route is considered by the liquids temperature, which represents the melting potential of the main ash composition and is calculated using the chemical equilibrium methods. The partial least square regression (PLSR) technique, coupled with a cross validation method, is employed to obtain the correlation for the ash deposition indice. The method has been successfully applied to coals/blends combustion in boilers, ranging from low rank coals to bituminous coal. The results obtained show that the developed indice yields a higher success rate in classifying the overall slagging/fouling potential in boilers than some of the typical slagging indices. In addition, only using the SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio to predict the melting behaviors and slagging potential is inaccurate since the effect of the SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio is dictated by both the original ash composition {{and the way in which}} the SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio is changed. Finally, the influence of the acid components (SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3) on the ash deposition prediction is investigated for guiding the mineral additives.

The geochemistry of basalts and mantle xenoliths demonstrates that the mantle is heterogeneous. The geochemical reservoirs are related to mantle convection, with interpretation of a mantle layered or stratified or peppered with blobs. Seismic tomography is beginning to reveal the density distribution of the mantle in three dimensions, and together with fluid mechanical models and interpretation of the geoid, closer limits are being placed on mantle <b>convection.</b> Petrological cross <b>sections</b> constructed for various tectonic environments by transferring phase boundaries for source rocks onto assumed thermal structures provide physical frameworks for consideration of magmatic and metasomatic events, with examples being given for basalts, andesites, and granites at ocean-continent convergent plate boundaries, basalts and nephelinites from a thermal plume beneath Hawaii, kimberlites in cratons, nephelinites from continental rifts, and anorogenic granites. The fluid dynamics of rock-melt-vapor systems exerts strong control on igneous processes and chemical differentiation. Unravelling the processes during subduction {{remains one of the}} major problems for understanding mantle heterogeneities and the evolution of continents...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Ventilation Model is to {{simulate}} the heat transfer processes in and around waste emplacement drifts during periods of forced ventilation. The model evaluates the effects of emplacement drift ventilation on the thermal conditions in the emplacement drifts and surrounding rock mass, and calculates the heat removal by ventilation {{as a measure of}} the viability of ventilation to delay the onset of peak repository temperature and reduce its magnitude. The heat removal by ventilation is temporally and spatially dependent, and is expressed as the fraction of heat carried away by the ventilation air compared to the fraction of heat produced by radionuclide decay. One minus the heat removal is called the wall heat fraction, or the remaining amount of heat that is transferred via conduction to the surrounding rock mass. Downstream models, such as the ''Multiscale Thermohydrologic Model'' (BSC 2001), use the wall heat fractions as outputted from the Ventilation Model to initialize their post-closure analyses. The Ventilation Model report was initially developed to analyze the effects of preclosure continuous ventilation in the Engineered Barrier System (EBS) emplacement drifts, and to provide heat removal data to support EBS design. Revision 00 of the Ventilation Model included documentation of the modeling results from the ANSYS-based heat transfer model. Revision 01 ICN 01 included the results of the unqualified software code MULTIFLUX to assess the influence of moisture on the ventilation efficiency. The purposes of Revision 02 of the Ventilation Model are: (1) To validate the conceptual model for preclosure ventilation of emplacement drifts and verify its numerical application in accordance with new procedural requirements as outlined in AP-SIII- 10 Q, Models (Section 7. 0). (2) To satisfy technical issues posed in KTI agreement RDTME 3. 14 (Reamer and Williams 2001 a). Specifically to demonstrate, with respect to the ANSYS ventilation model, the adequacy of the discretization (Section 6. 2. 3. 1), and the downstream applicability of the model results (i. e. wall heat fractions) to initialize post-closure thermal models (Section 6. 6). (3) To satisfy the remainder of KTI agreement TEF 2. 07 (Reamer and Williams 2001 b). Specifically to provide the results of post-test ANSYS modeling of the Atlas Facility forced <b>convection</b> tests (<b>Section</b> 7. 1. 2). This portion of the model report also serves as a validation exercise per AP-SIII. 10 Q, Models, for the ANSYS ventilation model. (4) To asses the impacts of moisture on the ventilation efficiency...|$|R
40|$|We present novel {{constraints}} on cosmic-ray propagation in the Galaxy using the recent precise measurements of proton and helium spectra from AMS- 02, together with preliminary AMS- 02 {{data on the}} antiproton over proton ratio. To explore efficiently the large (up to eleven-dimensional) parameter space we employ the nested-sampling algorithm as implemented in the MultiNest package, interfaced with the Galprop code to compute the model-predicted spectra. We use VOYAGER proton and helium data, sampling the local inter-stellar spectra, to constrain the solar modulation potential. We find that the turbulence of the Galactic magnetic field is well constrained, i. e., δ= 0. 30 ^+ 0. 03 _- 0. 02 (stat) ^+ 0. 10 _- 0. 04 (sys), with uncertainties dominated by systematic effects. Systematic uncertainties are determined checking the robustness of the results to the minimum rigidity cut used to fit the data (from 1 GV to 5 GV), to the propagation scenario (convection vs no-convection), and to the uncertainties in {{the knowledge of the}} antiproton production cross <b>section.</b> <b>Convection</b> and reaccelaration are found to be degenerate and not well-constrained singularly when using data above 5 GV. Using data above 1 GV reacceleration is required, v_ A= 25 ± 2 km/s, although this value might be significantly affected by the low energy systematic uncertainty in the solar modulation. In a forthcoming companion paper, we investigate the constraints imposed by AMS- 02 measurements on lithium, boron, and carbon.
