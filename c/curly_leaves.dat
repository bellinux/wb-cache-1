40|$|The SUNY Biological Field Station {{has been}} {{involved}} in monitoring aquatic macrophyte communities in Lake Moraine, continuously since summer, 1997. This work has focused upon efforts to control the nuisance, non-native Eurasian water-milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum). After a long history of using mechanical harvesting and non-selective herbicides (i. e., copper sulfate; Simazine), the Lake Moraine Association opted to pursue more selective, environmentally friendly options. Sonar, a selective herbicide, was first applied during the spring of 1996. While research by others and by the BFS could not empirically demonstrate success because of methodological problems, anecdotal observations suggested that water-milfoil was reduced. In 1998 and again in 2000, after any affects of that treatment would have been exhausted, the north basin was stocked with Euhrychiopsis lecontei, a weevil known to feed upon the apical regions of water-milfoil, in hopes of establishing a long-term means of controlling that plant. Monitoring since then has not shown a sustained increase in that insect’s population, nor increased evidence of milfoil damage by it. Sonar was again applied in May 2001, this time throughout the entire littoral area of the south basin. Monitoring throughout that summer documented the near-eradication of water-milfoil there. Additionally, <b>curly</b> <b>leaved</b> pondweed (Potamogeton crispus), another nuisance exotic, suffered severe mortality. Some native plants also were impacted, but most rebounded over the course of that summer. Monitoring throughout the summer of 2002 demonstrated the continued trend of milfoil decimation in the south basin; however, Elodea canadensis, a native macrophyte damaged by th...|$|R
50|$|This {{perennial}} bunchgrass is {{variable in}} appearance. It has no rhizomes or stolons. It grows anywhere from 7 to 100 cm tall. The grass {{takes the form}} of a crowded tuft of leaves at ground level. The leaves often become curly and persist as they dry out. Plants in shady and moist areas may not have <b>curly</b> <b>leaves.</b> The inflorescence is a narrow panicle of up to 18 spikelets. The spikelets have twisted, hairy awns. There are also some unopening, cleistogamous florets next to the leaves, and in the panicles. There is a long-lasting soil seed bank, with the seeds persisting for decades before being stimulated to germinate.|$|E
50|$|Different {{styles of}} oolong tea can vary widely in flavor. They can be sweet and fruity with honey aromas, or woody and thick with roasted aromas, or green and fresh with bouquet aromas, all {{depending}} on the horticulture and style of production. Several types of oolong tea, including those produced in the Wuyi Mountains of northern Fujian, such as Da Hong Pao, {{are among the most}} famous Chinese teas. Different varieties of oolong are processed differently, but the leaves are usually formed into one of two distinct styles. Some are rolled into long <b>curly</b> <b>leaves,</b> while others are 'wrap-curled' into small beads, each with a tail. The former style is the more traditional.|$|E

Such designs were fashionable in ancient Rome, as fresco wall decoration, floor mosaics, etc., and were decried by Vitruvius (c. 30 BC), who in dismissing them as meaningless and illogical, offered the description: [...] "reeds are substituted for columns, fluted appendages with <b>curly</b> <b>leaves</b> and volutes {{take the place of}} pediments, candelabra support representations of shrines, and on top of their roofs grow slender stalks and volutes with human figures senselessly seated upon them." ...|$|E
40|$|Acetone {{extracts}} {{of selected}} plant species were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicity against a noncancerous African green monkey kidney (Vero) cell line and an adenocarcinoma cervical cancer (HeLa) cell line. The plants studied were Origanum vulgare L. (Oregano), Rosmarinus officinalis L. (Upright and ground cove rosemary), Lavandula spica L. (Lavender), Laurus nobilis L. (Bay leaf), Thymus vulgaris L. (Thyme), Lavandula x intermedia L. (Margaret Roberts Lavender), Petroselinum crispum Mill. (<b>Curly</b> <b>leaved</b> parsley), Foeniculum vulgare Mill. (Fennel), and Capsicum annuum L. (Paprika). Antioxidant activity was determined using a quantitative DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl hydrazyl) assay. The rosemary species exhibited effective radical scavenging capacity with 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 3. 48 ± 0. 218 [*]μg/mL and 10. 84 ± 0. 125 [*]μg/mL and vitamin C equivalents of 0. 351 [*]g and 1. 09 [*]g for McConnell’s Blue and Tuscan Blue, respectively. Cytotoxicity {{was measured using}} XTT (Sodium 3 ′-[1 -(phenyl amino-carbonyl) - 3, 4 -tetrazolium]-bis-[4 -methoxy- 6 -nitro] benzene sulfonic acid hydrate) colorimetric assay. Only L. nobilis and O. vulgare exhibited pronounced effects on the HeLa cell line.

50|$|It {{can be used}} as a wild leaf vegetable; {{the young}} leaves should be boiled in several changes of water to remove as much of the oxalic acid in the leaves as {{possible}} or can be added directly to salads in moderate amounts. Once the plant matures it becomes too bitter to consume. Dock leaves are an excellent source of both vitamin A and vitamin C, as well as a source of iron and potassium. <b>Curly</b> Dock <b>leaves</b> are somewhat tart due to the presence of high levels of oxalic acid, and although quite palatable, this plant should only be consumed in moderation as it can irritate the urinary tract and increase the risk of developing kidney stones.

5000|$|The {{picture is}} painted in tempera on a chalk base with an {{engraved}} drawing outlined in black. It is on a lime-wood panel and measures 89 x 59.5 cm. Compared with older Italian-Byzantine models, the drawing is suppressed and the painter models volume using {{the technique of}} thin, glazed paint layers of colour gradation in the incarnates. The Madonna has a gold-embroidered white cloak and a blue cloak with green lining decorated with gold stars. The Madonna’s cloak and white veil and the transparent shirt of the child are decorated along their hems with gold embroidery. The crown is decorated with <b>curly</b> <b>leaves.</b> The stones and pearls on the crown, halos, hems and clasp were mounted later on, while the background was also subsequently gilded over. The ring on the Madonna’s finger refers to the mystic betrothal of Christ and Mary that symbolises the Christian Church. This allegorical identification of Mary with the Church is characteristic of the Cistercian context and stems from the preaching of St Bernard of Clairvaux.In its composition, the picture has {{much in common with}} the [...] Madonna of Veveří type and the later Madonna of Rome. At the same time, however, it also repeats several motifs from earlier Marian pictures. Its colour palette recalls the painting of Tomasso da Modena. The motif of the Infant Jesus holding a goldfinch or waxwing (here) was widespread through Italy from the early 14th century and appears in the Rajhrad Breviary of Queen Elizabeth Richeza of Poland. In contrast to the older Italian-Byzantine type of Madonna, the Hodegetria in which the mother presents the child as an object of worship, in this composition there is a tangible shift to a more human and intimate relationship between the mother and child that corresponds more to the ideas of believers around the mid-14th century.|$|E
40|$|Abstract An AGAMOUS homolog (FpAG) was {{isolated}} from green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) using a reverse transcriptase {{polymerase chain reaction}} method. Southern blot analysis indicated that FpAG was present as a single-copy sequence in the genome of green ash. RNA accumulated in the reproductive tissues (female inflores-cence, male inflorescence, and fruit) and vegetative tissues (leaves and in vitro-germinated seedlings). Expression was higher in reproductive tissues than in vegetative tissues. Ectopic expression of FpAG in transgenic Arabidopsis plants resulted {{in a range of}} weak to strong APETALA 2 (AP 2) mutant-like phenotypes, including early flowering, <b>curly</b> <b>leaves,</b> and conversion of petals to stamens.

Custer, leading over 500 men, intended to crush at least 900 encamped Cheyenne, Sioux and Arapaho warriors by delivering a three-pronged assault but ultimately the Americans were repulsed, {{leading to the}} deaths of over 250 soldiers. Four of the scouts, Curly, Goes Ahead, Hairy Moccasin and White Man Runs Him rode with Custer's column while two others, Half Yellow Face and White Swan, rode with Major Marcus Reno. Custer's scouts were relieved just before the beginning of the main battle because they changed out of their blue uniforms and put on their tribal wear. The scouts angered Custer and said they wanted to die like warriors, not as soldiers. Seventeen-year-old <b>Curly</b> refused to <b>leave</b> though but through the insistence of Mitch Bouyer, a mixed-blood French and Lakota guide, the young man was convinced to depart with the other three scouts.
