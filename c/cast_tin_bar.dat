50|$|The pack mill {{process begins}} with a <b>tin</b> <b>bar,</b> which is a drawn flat bar that was usually {{purchased}} from an ironworks or steel works. The <b>tin</b> <b>bar</b> could be wrought iron or mild steel. The cross-section of the bar needed to be accurate in size as this dictates the length and thickness of the final plates. The bar was cut to the correct length to make the desired size plate; for instance, if a 14 x 20 in plate is desired the <b>tin</b> <b>bar</b> is cut to a length and width that is divisible by 14 and 20. The bar is then rolled and doubled over, {{with the number of}} times being doubled over dependent on how large the <b>tin</b> <b>bar</b> is and what the final thickness is. Continuing the example, if the starting <b>tin</b> <b>bar</b> is 20 x 56 in then it must be at least finished on the fours, or doubled over twice, and if a thin gauge is required then it may be finished on the eights, or doubled over three times. The <b>tin</b> <b>bar</b> is then heated to a dull red heat and passed five or six times through the roughing rolls. Between each pass the plate is passed over (or round) the rolls, and the gap between the rolls is narrowed by means of a screw. The plate is then reheated and run through the finishing rolls.|$|R

40|$|The {{tin metal}} could be {{retractable}} from wasted tin scrap, sludge, and wasted electroplated solution hydrometallurgical treatment, and purification process. In {{order to be}} used as resource of electronic devices, the retracted crude metal should be purified to the extent of higher than 99. 9 %. In this study, tin electro-refining process was performed to purify the <b>casted</b> <b>tin</b> crude metal at various experimental conditions: at the current density of 3, 5 A/dm 2, and in various electrolytes such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and methansulfonic acid. Additional experiment was conducted using Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) in order to investigate the rate determining step of tin electro-refining process. The current efficiency, 65. 6 %, was achievable at the condition of current density, 5 A/dm 2, and in the electrolyte of Hydrochloric acid. During tin electro-refining process, impurity dissolved from tin crude metal into the electrolyte was analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES), and the result showed the concentration of impurity metal gradually increased. Quantitative analysis on <b>casted</b> <b>tin</b> crude metal showed that it consists of tin with 93. 9 wt. % and several impurity metals of Ag, Bi, Pb, Cu, and etc. After tin electro-refining process, the purity of tin increased up to 99. 985 wt. %...|$|R

Twenty-four full copper oxhide ingots have stamps on their centersâ€”usually of a circle containing intersecting lines. These stamps were likely made when the metal was soft. In addition, the ship contained numerous complete and incomplete copper bun-shaped ingots, rectangular <b>tin</b> <b>bars,</b> and Cypriot agricultural tools made of scrap bronze.

40|$|The changes {{produced}} on metallic surfaces {{as a result}} of grinding and polishing are not as yet fully understood. Undoubtedly there is some more or less marked change in the crystal structure, at least, in the top layer. Hereby a diffusion of separated crystal particles may be involved, or, on plastic material, the formation of a layer in greatly deformed state, with possible recrystallization in certain conditions. Czochralski verified the existence of such a layer on tin micro-sections by successive observations of the texture after repeated etching; while Thomassen established, roentgenographically by means of the Debye-Scherrer method, the existence of diffused crystal fractions on the surface of ground and polished <b>tin</b> <b>bars,</b> which he had already observed after turning (on the lathe). (Thickness of this layer - 0. 07 mm). Whether this layer borders direct on the undamaged base material or whether deformed intermediate layers form the transition, nothing is known.

[...] He received his first starring role later that year in Little Tiger of Canton that had a limited release in Hong Kong in 1973.
