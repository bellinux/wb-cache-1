25|$|Before the Slovak {{independence}} {{two main}} issues appeared regarding language: {{the right to}} use non-Slovakized versions of women's names and the use of bilingual street signs. Non Slovaks were forced to Slovakize female personal names in official documents by attaching the Slovak feminine suffix '-ová'. Members of ethnic minorities were restricted in their <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>given</b> <b>names,</b> as registry offices accepted only names from a limited list only. After ten years wrangling, the second Dzurinda cabinet eased these restrictions.|$|R

25|$|First {{names are}} {{chosen by the}} child's parents. There are no legal a priori {{constraints}} on the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> names nowadays, but this {{has not always been}} the case. The <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>given</b> <b>names,</b> originally limited only by the tradition of naming children after a small number of popular saints, was restricted by law {{at the end of the}} 18th century, could be accepted. Much later, actually in 1966, a new law permitted a limited number of mythological, regional or foreign names, substantives (Olive, Violette), diminutives, and alternative spellings. Only in 1993 were French parents given the freedom to name their child without any constraint whatsoever. However, if the birth registrar thinks that the chosen names (alone or in association with the last name) may be detrimental to the child's interests, or to the right of other families to protect their own family name, the registrar may refer the matter to the local prosecutor, who may choose to refer the matter to the local court. The court may then refuse the chosen names. Such refusals are rare and mostly concern <b>given</b> <b>names</b> that may expose the child to mockery.|$|R

40|$|Based on {{research}} done in 2012, {{this paper presents}} how immigrant children educated in present- day Hungarian public schools are named, paying special attention to name assimilation and acculturation. Describing the characteristic features <b>of</b> <b>given</b> <b>names</b> and changes in name order is important, because it may offer a basis for {{a better understanding of}} Hungarian historical onomastic sources concerning the name use of immigrant groups. This research proves that the Hungarian name order (family <b>name</b> + <b>given</b> <b>name)</b> is extremely influential today and shows no sign of ethnic dependence in administrative or school communication. Inclination toward assimilation displayed in the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> the <b>given</b> <b>name,</b> in most cases, appears in informal names, and affects official names only to a lesser degree. Functionally, the informal names are names for the child, usually chosen by a parent or the child him- or herself. Mostly, these names are acknowledged Hungarian <b>given</b> <b>names,</b> coinciding with those used in contemporary Hungarian communities; a small proportion of the names under discussion, however, are morphologically modified forms, in which the function of the present-day Hungarian diminutive suffix is presumably misinterpreted by the name bearers...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2004. Naming {{is a very}} {{important}} tool used among various African cultures to convey certain messages, either to an individual, family members or a community. Naming of various objects is linked with the socio-political factors of countries where anthroponyms and toponyms are found. It {{is for this reason that}} onomastics (the study of names) can never be isolated from studying the dynamics of various societies, the behaviour and the psychology of different individuals. While names can unite communities, they can also serve as a dividing tool in various communities. It is from names that one can learn the various cultures that have been present in a particular place, and have an understanding and the appreciation of the history of a place. Onomastics is multidisciplinary in nature. It can be approached from different perspectives. These include linguistic, historical, sociological, philosophical, economical and other perspectives. Chapter two focuses on the linguistic and semantic aspects of names. It explores onomastic definitions and the comparison between the meaning of Euro-western and African names. In Chapter two an argument is presented on the morphological structure of Zulu and/or Xhosa names for boys and girls. In this Chapter the orthography of place names is also discussed. The importance of standardising names for purposes of having one name for one entity and asserting the country's history and heritage cannot be overemphasised. As indicated above that onomastics can also be approached from a historic approach, Chapter 3 looks at the changing political scenario in South Africa that has had an impact on the culture of indigenous people, their identity and the existence of Euro-western names among them. The arrival of white people in South Africa contaminated the indigenous culture and the African belief systems. The traditional belief system of the indigenous people is discussed in Chapter three together with the advent of Christianity. Chapter four looks at the sociological approach in onomastics. Names of any nature exist in a society. These names reflect the social dynamics of the societies where they are found. The society plays a major role in influencing the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>names</b> <b>given</b> to individuals and entities. These names have different functions in societies. The different functions that names have in various communities are also discussed. In Chapter four the significance of anthroponyms and toponyms is discussed. Various types of names are also looked at. Political changes witnessed in the country play a major role in transforming the country whether economically, culturally or socially. The impact of political changes and the attitudes of South Africans towards name changes are discussed in Chapter five. President Thabo Mbeki's call for an African renaissance came at the time when South Africa attained its independence. The adoption of African names was on the increase during this period. Chapter six looks at the link between changing naming patterns and the African renaissance. As an African renaissance calls for the rebirth of African culture and ways of living, xenophobic attitudes among Africans are examined. It is argued that Africa's rebirth is dependant on various issues including the respect and value that Africans give each other. Onomastics, as mentioned above can be studied using different approaches, however the limitedness of this study prevents discussion on all approaches. Onomastics is a relatively new field in South Africa, however its multidisciplinary nature and the abundance of data, invites more studies to be conducted. Chapter seven makes recommendations on some of the onomastic studies that may be conducted in future...|$|R

A recommender system can help a person in this task by recommending <b>given</b> <b>names</b> which are <b>of</b> interest to the user. In this paper, we exploit contextual information (e. g., time and location) in two state-of-the-art recommender systems for the task <b>of</b> recommending <b>given</b> <b>names.</b> The empirical results have shown that we can improve the recommendation <b>of</b> <b>given</b> <b>names</b> by using contextual information...|$|R
