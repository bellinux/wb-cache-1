Investors have required more information also about how sustainability issues and initiatives are expected to contribute to the long-term growth strategy of a business. This communication, which should be provided by top management, leads toward the convergence of sustainability and financial reporting into a single “narrative. ” Both financial reporting and non-financial reporting together provide all stakeholders with a comprehensive view of the position and performance of a company. This process has also been encouraged by some European regulations.

40|$|We examine {{data for}} the year ended December 31, 1997 for 80 {{publicly}} traded property-liability insurers that have Best financial strength ratings of their consolidated insurance-operating subsidiaries. These firms employ a holding company structure, in which a parent owns the stock of multiple insurance-operating subsidiaries. The operating subsidiaries prepare a <b>consolidated</b> <b>annual</b> <b>report</b> using the Statutory Accounting Principles (SAP), and an analogous set of financial statements based on the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is released by the parent. We find that the financial characteristics important in determining ratings at the individual firm level-capitalization, liquidity, profitability, and size-are also important at the group level. Further, financial ratios from holding company statements are incrementally useful in the ratings' process, after group-level ratios have been taken into account. Robustness tests based on a subsample of holding companies with minimal investment outside of the property-liability industry reinforce our conclusion that parent company statements influence consolidated group ratings. However, our data do {{not allow us to}} separate the relative contribution of the GAAP model and underlying transactions to the ratings decision. Copyright The Journal of Risk and Insurance. ...|$|E

The evidence {{does not support the}} practice of lIAs 2 ̆ 7 amortisation in order to reduce covenant limitations under existing debt contracts and future debt raisings, and to cause minimisation of political vulnerability. Support for the profit-based managerial compensation incentives to amortise liAs appears only in 1989, possibly due to the pending ED 49 2 ̆ 2 Accounting for Identifiable Intangible Assets 2 ̆ 2 issued by the Australian Accounting Research Foundation which required systematic amortisation of IIAs.

The strategy chosen by Enichem of leaving the productive vertical integration in favour of an outsourcing of numerous activities has not brought any benefit to the company in terms of profitability.

This <b>annual</b> <b>report</b> presents key statistics for the year past (2014 - 2015) as well as a series of snapshots of activity, expressed as short highlights and short reports. Key data centre metrics are also provided. This year was characterised by the major upgrade in JASMIN capability(JASMIN being the data intensive supercomputer which provides the fabric upon which CEDA and the CEDA services are delivered). As in the advent of JASMIN itself, in early 2012, this has had a major impact both on what CEDA can do, and the services that can be offered to the community — and the uptake in the community is clear to see in the statistics presented here. The consequences for CEDA itself are still being worked through, but it is clear that there is a significant expansion in the role of CEDA staff whose expertise must now embrace support for “big data” tools and algorithms by archive and other users on JASMIN. Notwithstanding this new role, as in previous years, CEDA staff are involved in nearly all the major atmospheric science programmes underway in the UK, in many earth observation programmes, and in a wide range of informatics activities.

The authors examine each stage of the life cycle, from birth and infancy to childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age. In developing countries the main direct causes of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) are nutritional. IUGR infants {{are more likely to}} become stunted children. Data on the nutritional status of school-age children are increasingly being collected, as evidence mounts linking malnutrition or hunger with poor school attendance, performance, and learning. The economic livelihood of populations depends on the health and nutritional well-being of adults. Recent multicountry studies have shown significant malnutrition among older adults. Vicious circles—such as the life cycle of malnutrition—based as they are on mutually reinforcing processes, can be transformed into virtuous circles by more consistently and effectively applying our growing knowledge of what works, and where, in combating malnutrition. While preventing fetal and early childhood malnutrition deserves particular attention, the life cycle dynamics of cause and consequence demand a holistic, inclusive approach to malnutrition. Adequate nutrition is a human right for all people, and intervening at each point in the life cycle will accelerate and <b>consolidate</b> positive change. <b>Annual</b> <b>report</b> essayNon-PRIFPRI...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the effect of governance on {{the degree to which}} clean audits have been achieved in South African municipalities. Its pertinence lies in the context of two endemic public management performance weaknesses, namely, the elusive target set by the COGTA and Auditor-General to achieve clean audits in all South African municipalities by 2014, and the ubiquitous service delivery failures in South African municipalities. These failures are now widespread and apparently negates the national goal of an inclusive socioeconomic development process for the country. Thus, the article makes a contribution, by identifying cost-effective measures for improved governance (and subsequent improved audit outcomes), by addressing the seeming scarcity of empirical investigation into the effect of governance on the achievement of clean audits. The methodological approach employs a panel data study of audit performance of all municipalities in South Africa hence, a quantitative approach – the panel data regression analysis, was used to analyse the data The data comprises the Auditor- General of South Africa’s (AGSA) <b>consolidated</b> <b>annual</b> municipal <b>reports</b> for the financial years 2009 / 10 to 2013 / 14 for the country’s nine provinces. The data was retrieved from the AGSA’s archives of consolidated municipal audit reports. A panel data analysis gave a total of 45 observations which were subjected to regression analysis. The statistical findings show that quality of governance significantly affects the achievement of a clean audit at a significance value of P < 0. 02. This finding suggests that a declining effectiveness in governance may well have played the key role in derailing the public sector’s intended journey to universal clean audits by 2014. In its conclusion this article recognises the need to evaluate the specific effectiveness of governance relative to the impact of the other variables that were understood to affect clean audit, namely financial management and leadership. Furthermore, this article identifies the major variables within governance that underlie and drive its key position, in the hope of guiding the AGSA in directing resources most effectively...|$|R
