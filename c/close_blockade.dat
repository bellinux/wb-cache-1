5|$|Another {{feature of}} the French Revolutionary Wars was the effect of British {{blockade}} on French movements. The Royal Navy maintained an active <b>close</b> <b>blockade</b> of all major French ports during the conflict, which resulted in every French ship that left port facing attack from squadrons and individual ships patrolling the French and allied coasts. The losses the French Navy suffered {{as a result of}} this strategy were high, and the blockade was so effective that even movement between ports along the French coasts was restricted. In the Indian Ocean however the huge distances between the French bases on Réunion and Isle de France and the British bases in India meant that <b>close</b> <b>blockade</b> was an ineffective strategy: the scale of the forces required to maintain an effective constant blockade of both islands, as well as the Dutch ports at the Cape of Good Hope and in the Dutch East Indies were too large to be worth their deployment to such a distant part of the world. As a result, the French raiders operating from the Indian Ocean bases were able to travel with more freedom and less risk of interception than those in the Atlantic or Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|In 1809 the Royal Navy was {{dominant}} in the Atlantic, the French Atlantic fleet trapped by <b>close</b> <b>blockade</b> in the French Biscay ports by the British Channel Fleet. The largest French base was at Brest in Brittany, where {{the main body of}} the French fleet lay at anchor under the command of Contre-amiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, with smaller French detachments stationed at Lorient and Rochefort. The squadron at Lorient comprised three ships of the line and five frigates under Commodore Amable Troude, watched by its own blockade squadron of four ships of the line under Captain John Poo Beresford.|$|E
5|$|By 1798 the British Royal Navy had {{successfully}} contained the French Navy {{within its own}} harbours, employing a strategy of <b>close</b> <b>blockade</b> to ensure dominance at sea during the French Revolutionary Wars. The strategy was particularly effective in the English Channel, where the proximity of British bases and the importance in limiting {{the movements of the}} French invasion forces stationed around Boulogne focused British attention on the Normandy coast. This was essential to prevent the concentration of a large force of invasion barges that had been constructed at various harbours under the guidance of a Captain Muskein. To improve the Royal Navy's ability to observe French movements on the Normandy coast, a force under the command of Captain Sir Sidney Smith seized, garrisoned, and fortified the uninhabited Îles Saint-Marcouf in 1795.|$|E
50|$|In {{her second}} Western Pacific (WestPac) {{deployment}} since recommissioning, Wiseman screened light carrier task forces off {{the west coast}} of Korea; carried out patrol assignments <b>close</b> inshore; <b>blockaded</b> and bombarded segments of the northeastern Korean coast, and provided antisubmarine screen and escort services for replenishment groups. Later in the deployment, she also participated in hunter-killer operations, trained in antisubmarine warfare (ASW) evolutions, and served as division flagship during a goodwill call at Manila.|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{the removal}} {{and a threat}} on Sondhi's program, freedom of press became the focus. Sutthichai Yoon, another major critic, was filed a case against. In early 2006, the {{supporters}} of Thaksin Shinawatra, claimed supported by the premier himself and his <b>close</b> figures, <b>blockaded</b> the entry of the Nation Group building, threatening to [...] "burn" [...] the building. Possibly the movement rallied by Sondhi, then {{became the focus of}} several anti-Thaksin groups.|$|R
60|$|So he {{converted}} the siege into a <b>blockade,</b> <b>closing</b> all roads {{that lead to}} Faenza, {{with a view to}} shutting out supplies from the town; and he distributed troops throughout the villages of the territory with orders constantly to harass the garrison and allow it no rest.|$|R
5|$|By November 1808, the Napoleonic Wars {{had lasted}} five years. Although the French had conquered large swathes of {{mainland}} Europe, {{they were unable}} to exert any significant influence at sea, where the British Royal Navy had been dominant since the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805. A vital part of Royal Navy strategy was the implementation of a <b>close</b> <b>blockade</b> of the major French seaports by squadrons of frigates and ships of the line, intended to intercept and capture any ships attempting to enter or leave French harbours. The greatest French Atlantic seaport, and consequently the most important target for the Royal Navy, was Brest, situated on the Northern Biscay coast. Watching Brest were a large number of warships, divided into the inshore squadron designed to watch the coast directly and formed principally of frigates and small fast vessels, and the offshore squadron formed from heavy ships of the line and tasked with intercepting French fleets and battle squadrons spotted by the inshore squadron.|$|E
5|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1810 the Napoleonic Wars had lasted for seven years and the French Navy, {{over the course of}} the conflict, had been {{successively}} driven from the Atlantic until every French port was watched by a Royal Navy <b>close</b> <b>blockade,</b> ready to attack any French ship which emerged from harbour. In 1809, the main French fleet at Brest had attempted to break out into open water, only to be driven back and defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads. Much of the French effort at sea subsequently fell on commerce raiders, including privateers and frigate squadrons, often operating from smaller harbours such as those on the Northern coast of France in the English Channel. The two principal raiding ports were Cherbourg and Le Havre in Normandy, each of which maintained squadrons. In 1810, Cherbourg's anchorage held two ships of the line and a large, newly built frigate Iphigénie, while the frigates Elisa and Amazone were stationed at Le Havre.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} French majority in numbers, {{the attack was}} a disaster: nearly 1,000 French soldiers were killed as the boats were caught in open water under the island's gun batteries: several were sunk with all hands. Heavy fire from batteries and Royal Marines prevented a single French soldier from landing and the retreating fleet was subject to heavy fire from the smaller island to the north, inflicting further losses. British casualties were negligible. Although this operation indicated the probable result of a full-scale invasion of Britain, the threat remained and British forces began a <b>close</b> <b>blockade</b> of the surviving landing craft that were anchored in the Cotentin ports. A month after the battle this strategy resulted in a secondary success when a French frigate and corvette passing along the coast were intercepted and defeated by the blockade squadron.|$|E
50|$|During {{the summer}} and autumn of 1941 the Finnish Army was on the offensive, retaking the territories lost in the Winter War. The Finnish army also {{advanced}} further, especially {{in the direction of}} Lake Onega, (east from Lake Ladoga), <b>closing</b> the <b>blockade</b> of the city of Leningrad from the north, and occupying Eastern Karelia, which had never been a part of Finland before. This caused Great Britain to declare war on Finland on 6 December. The German and Finnish troops in Northern Finland were less successful, failing to take the Russian port city of Murmansk during Operation Silver Fox.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2005, an {{agreement}} was signed {{to build a}} new railway connecting Turkey with Georgia and Azerbaijan, passing through Akhalkalaki. This would bypass an existing line through Gyumri in Armenia which has been <b>closed</b> by Turkey, <b>blockading</b> Armenia, for political reasons since the 1990s. [...] It is here where the break-of-gauge will be.|$|R
50|$|Again, Huron {{provided}} {{a part of}} the devastating naval bombardment; and, {{with the help of a}} landing party of 2,000 sailors and marines, the Union Army assault forces captured Fort Fisher on 15 January 1865, effectually <b>closing</b> Wilmington to <b>blockade</b> runners. Then, during the final months of the war, Huron took part in combined operations against the city itself, bombarding Forts Anderson, and St. Philip in February.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the French Revolutionary Wars, {{although}} the French Navy had sought to oppose the Royal Navy at sea from their main base at Brest in Brittany, the Royal Navy had achieved victories at the Glorious First of June and Battle of Groix. The losses inflicted on the French Atlantic fleet in these battles were compounded by large numbers of ships wrecked in storms during the disastrous Croisière du Grand Hiver and Expédition d'Irlande operations. By 1798 the Royal Navy was unopposed in its control of the Atlantic, enforcing its supremacy by a strategy of <b>close</b> <b>blockade,</b> maintaining a battle fleet at sea off Brittany and an inshore squadron of frigates watching the approaches to Brest. In June 1798 the inshore squadron included a detachment comprising the 38-gun HMS Jason under Captain Charles Stirling, the 36-gun HMS Pique under Captain David Milne and 32-gun HMS Mermaid under Captain James Newman-Newman.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 25 September 1806 was a naval battle fought {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars off the French Biscay port of Rochefort. A French {{squadron}} comprising five frigates and two corvettes, sailing to the French West Indies with supplies and reinforcements, was intercepted by a British squadron of six ships {{of the line}} that was keeping a <b>close</b> <b>blockade</b> of the port {{as part of the}} Atlantic campaign of 1806. The British ships, under the command of Commodore Sir Samuel Hood, spotted the French convoy early in the morning of 25 September, just a few hours after the French had left port, and immediately gave chase. Although the French ships tried to escape, they were heavily laden with troops and stores, and the strong winds favoured the larger ships of the line, which caught the French convoy after a five-hour pursuit, although they had become separated from one another during the chase.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 30 June 1798 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} fought {{along the}} Biscay coast of France during the French Revolutionary Wars. The French Navy had been largely driven from the Atlantic Ocean early in the war following heavy losses {{in a series of}} failed operations. This had allowed the Royal Navy's Channel Fleet to institute a <b>close</b> <b>blockade</b> on the French naval ports of the Biscay coast, particularly Brest in Brittany. The blockade strategy included a constantly patrolling inshore squadron composed of frigates, tasked with preventing the passage of French ships into or out of the port. In the spring of 1798, several French frigates stationed in the Indian Ocean were sent back to France as the base at Île de France could no longer supply them effectively. One of these ships was the 40-gun frigate Seine, which departed Port Louis laden with 280 soldiers from the garrison.|$|E
50|$|Subsequent {{wars and}} skirmishes passed {{control of the}} Canal to various powers {{including}} the United Kingdom, Egypt, Israel, and the United Nations. In 1956, the Suez Canal was nationalized by the Egyptian Government. On June 5, 1967, during the Six-Day War, it was <b>closed</b> and <b>blockaded</b> against Israel by Egypt. It was reopened on June 10, 1975. A multinational observer force including the United States, Israel, and Egypt currently oversees the Canal, which is owned and maintained by the Suez Canal Authority of the Arab Republic of Egypt. According to the international rules which govern navigation through Suez, Egypt cannot forbid any vessel from passing through the Suez Canal {{if there is no}} war between Egypt and that country.|$|R
2500|$|The Unadilla {{class was}} {{a class of}} gunboat built for the Union Navy at the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War. Ships of the class were also known as [...] "90-day gunboats" [...] due to their rapid construction. The class was designed to be fully oceangoing while having a light enough draft to be able to operate <b>close</b> inshore, for <b>blockade</b> duty or other operations in shallow waters.|$|R
5000|$|Following needed repairs, Genesee {{continued}} {{to patrol the}} Mississippi River until {{after the fall of}} Vicksburg 4 July 1863. Then, she was ordered to the Gulf for blockade duty on 11 September. She discovered blockade-running steamer Fanny bound for Mobile, Alabama, 11 September, and with Jackson and Calhoun gave chase. As they <b>closed,</b> the <b>blockade</b> runner's captain burned his ship to the waterline rather than allow her capture. Genesee {{continued to}} operate off Mobile with Admiral Farragut and assisted in several captures as the Navy prepared for the assault on Mobile Bay. When the fleet steamed boldly into the bay on 5 August to engage the forts and Confederate squadron, Genesee remained outside until the passage was effected, then steamed up to open fire on Fort Morgan.|$|R
5|$|The {{problem with}} {{enforcing}} a <b>close</b> <b>blockade</b> with ships was that warships loitering {{off the coast}} of Japan would be vulnerable to attack by aircraft and submarines. Blockading Japanese ports with small ships was a possibility, but this would first require the destruction or neutralisation of the Japanese fleet, and it was far from certain that the Japanese fleet would place itself in a position where it could be destroyed. A plan was adopted for a more distant blockade, whereby ships bound for Japan would be intercepted as they passed through the East Indies or the Panama Canal. This would not cut off Japan's trade with China or Korea, and probably not with the United States either. The effectiveness of such a blockade was therefore questionable.|$|E
5|$|By 1810 the French Navy fleet {{based in}} the Atlantic ports had been {{prevented}} from launching any major operations for four years, penned into harbour by the British strategy of <b>close</b> <b>blockade.</b> A failed attempt by a French fleet to sail had been defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads in 1809, and the main operations still {{carried out by the}} Navy were undertaken by privateers and frigate squadrons operating commerce raiders operating from smaller ports, such as those on the English Channel. In November 1810 squadrons were based at Cherbourg, with two ships of the line and the newly built frigate Iphigénie, and Le Havre, with the frigates Elisa and Amazone, commanded by Captains Louis-Henri Fraycinet-Saulce and Bernard-Louis Rosseau respectively. To blockade these squadrons, the Royal Navy's Channel Fleet had assigned the ships of the line HMS Donegal under Captain Pulteney Malcolm and HMS Revenge under Captain Charles Paget to patrol the entrance to Cherbourg, while frigates HMS Diana under Captain Charles Grant and HMS Niobe under Captain John Wentworth Loring kept watch on Le Havre. The blockade had achieved some minor successes; in October 1810 Revenge had captured the privateer Vengeur from Dieppe, and on 6 November Donegal ran down and seized the privateer Surcouf from Cherbourg.|$|E
5|$|During the French Revolutionary Wars the Royal Navy had exerted {{dominance}} at sea {{over its}} continental rivals, most immediately the French Navy with its principal fleet based at Brest on the Breton {{coast of the}} Bay of Biscay. To contain this fleet the British practiced a <b>close</b> <b>blockade</b> strategy; maintaining a fleet off Brest whenever weather conditions permitted to prevent the French fleet from breaking out into the Atlantic Ocean. This blockade force also limited French trade and maritime communications, attacking merchant ships and individual warships seeking to resupply or reinforce the main French fleet. This made French maritime journeys extremely hazardous even in inshore waters: in June 1795 the main French fleet had suffered a defeat {{at the hands of}} the blockade force at the Battle of Groix in the approaches to the port of Lorient, while at the Action of 13 January 1797 the independently sailing 74-gun ship of the line Droits de l'Homme was driven ashore and destroyed in the approaches to Brest by two frigates of the blockade squadron.|$|E
25|$|All major NATO {{supply lines}} were {{immediately}} <b>closed</b> leaving the <b>blockaded</b> supply trucks vulnerable to attacks. On 26 November 2011, Gillani's government ordered the US {{to shut down}} and vacate the PAF Base Shamsi in the southwestern Balochistan province within a deadline of 15 days. On 10 December, the troops from the Frontier Corps took full control {{of the air force}} base as scheduled, and by 11 December all remaining American staff were evacuated.|$|R
25|$|In July 2011, the UN investigative {{committee}} {{said that the}} Israeli naval blockade of Gaza was legal, but that Israel used excessive force and should have waited to enforce the <b>blockade</b> <b>closer</b> to the shoreline. It also concluded that Turkey should have taken action {{to try to prevent}} the flotilla from taking place. In September 2011, the UN stated that Israel used excessive force and boarded the flotilla when it was far away from the blockade zone.|$|R
50|$|On 3 December 1864, a {{blockade}} runner, whose name {{could not be}} determined, ran aground off the western bar at Wilmington, at Marshall Shoals. Although within range of Fort Fisher's guns, Tristram Shandy <b>closed</b> the disabled <b>blockade</b> runner to destroy her before she could be salvaged by Southern forces. Commencing fire with her Parrott rifle and her 3-pounders, the Union gunboat soon reduced the grounded runner to a blazing wreck, down by the bow and sinking from numerous hits.|$|R
5|$|In late 1796, {{with the}} French Revolutionary Wars three years old, {{a major shift}} {{occurred}} in the conflict when the Kingdom of Spain, until that point {{an enemy of the}} French Republic, abruptly changed sides following the signing of the Treaty of San Ildefonso. This reversal forced the British Royal Navy to retire from the Mediterranean Sea to preserve its lines of communication, falling back to the mouth of the Tagus River near Lisbon. From the Tagus, pressure was placed on the Spanish Navy by the erstwhile British Mediterranean Fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir John Jervis, who organised a blockade of the main Spanish fleet base at Cádiz on the country's Southern Atlantic coast. This resulted in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent on 14 February 1797, when Jervis inflicted a stinging defeat on the Spanish fleet. The surviving Spanish ships limped back to Cádiz after the battle, and to ensure that they could not sail again without risking a repeat action, Jervis arranged a <b>close</b> <b>blockade</b> of the port so that by April there were 21 British ships of the line and numerous frigates watching the Spanish fleet at anchor.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} year, the French continued to attack British trade convoys, achieving important victories at the Action of 18 November 1809 and the Action of 3 July 1810, where they captured another five East Indiamen {{as well as}} numerous smaller merchant ships and a large Portuguese frigate. Rowley too was active, commanding the successful Invasion of Île Bonaparte in July and renaming the island Île Bourbon, basing his squadron at Saint Paul on the island's eastern shore. From this base, Rowley's ships were ideally positioned to begin a <b>close</b> <b>blockade</b> of Isle de France, led initially by Captain Samuel Pym in HMS Sirius. Pym sought to reduce French movement by seizing a number of fortified offshore islands, starting with Île de la Passe off Grand Port. The island was captured, but when a French squadron broke through the British blockade and took shelter in Grand Port, Pym resolved to attack them. The ensuing Battle of Grand Port was a disaster for Rowley's squadron, as Pym led four of Rowley's five frigates into the bay without adequately assessing the channel through the coral reefs that sheltered the harbour. As a result, two frigates grounded {{out of range of}} the enemy and the remaining two were outnumbered in confined waters. In a complicated battle lasting several days, two of Pym's frigates were captured and two more had to be scuttled, with their entire crews made prisoner. Rowley's reinforcements arrived too late, and the British commodore was chased back to Saint Denis by Hamelin's flagship.|$|E
25|$|By 1804, {{still in}} the Mediterranean and having {{transferred}} to Sovereign, Bickerton was serving as Second-in-Command to Admiral Lord Nelson, maintaining a <b>close</b> <b>blockade</b> on the French port of Toulon and when Nelson received the thanks of the Corporation of London, he insisted that Bickerton received equal recognition. Bickerton was elevated to Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean when Nelson left to pursue the French Fleet across the Atlantic.|$|E
5000|$|When the Union's naval <b>blockade</b> <b>closed</b> {{access to}} the New Orleans port, Thornhill & Co. was a half-million dollars in debt and had {{customers}} who could not pay their credit obligations to the firm. [...] Although the Civil War years caused debt problems for Richardson, {{at the end of}} the war he still owned the five plantations and 500 bales of cotton. He marketed his assets, rebounded financially, and was out of debt within a year.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Close</b> to the <b>blockades,</b> {{groups of}} antifascists confronted little groups of Nazis {{trying to get}} to their {{gathering}} point. More than 1,000 Nazis marched from the highway through suburbs through Dresden’s alternative [...] "Hechtviertel" [...] neighborhood, attacking an alternative youth center on their way to their gathering point at the Neustadt train station.More than 500 Nazis had gathered there to march. Due to the blockades the police called off the march in the afternoon. The police said it could not guarantee a safe and undisturbed march.|$|R
2500|$|Villeneuve {{came out}} of Cadiz in late 1805, and was engaged by Nelson in the decisive Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October. During the battle Neptune fired on Nelson's flagship, , and duelled with several British ships {{including}} , [...] and [...] As the British began to overwhelm the combined fleet, the relatively undamaged Neptune joined several ships in a retreat to Cadiz. She sortied again two days later {{in an attempt to}} recover some of the prizes, but the fleet lost more ships than they regained, and Neptune had to be towed back to harbour. There she remained, under a <b>close</b> British <b>blockade,</b> until the Spanish declared war on the French. Trapped in the port, the French handed their ships over to the Spanish, who renamed Neptune Neptuno, replacing a Spanish ship lost at Trafalgar. Neptuno served with the Spanish for a further 12 years, being broken up in 1820.|$|R
25|$|The {{application}} of the jolly boat was developed further during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, particularly by the frigate commander Sir George Collier. Collier, who {{was active in the}} <b>close</b> <b>blockade</b> of the Spanish coast during the Peninsular War, combined the features of a jolly boat with those of a whaleboat and found the result extremely seaworthy and particularly effective in carrying out shore landings. The design was particularly buoyant and was often described as a type of lifeboat. Several captains ordered these boats for their own ships, while the Admiralty considered the possibility of ordering a general replacement of old-style jolly boats with the new 'lifeboat' design on several occasions, but were deterred by the cost. By 1815 however the Stores Committee had authorised the replacement of the old-style jolly boats with the improved versions as and when it proved practical for a ship's commander to carry this out.|$|E
25|$|Villettes' force {{comprised}} detachments {{from the}} Royal Artillery and the 11th, 25th, 30th, 50th, and 69th Regiments of Foot alongside units of Royal Marines {{detached from the}} fleet. It was joined by Nelson's force of 250 sailors with eight 24-pounder long guns from HMS Agamemnon and four mortars sent from Naples. While the army forces laid preparations for operations against the town, Hood stationed his fleet in a semi-circle just offshore, with HMS Fortitude under Captain William Young at the centre. Inshore, Captain Benjamin Caldwell commanded a squadron of gunboats to enact a <b>close</b> <b>blockade</b> of the harbour. The frigate HMS Imperieuse under Captain William Wolesley was detached to blockade the island of Capraia, also in French hands and the site of large storehouses of food and ammunition, to prevent the garrison interfering in the siege or sending supplies to the defenders. The French {{made no effort to}} disrupt the landings or the subsequent siting of the batteries around the town.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} October 1813 the War of the Sixth Coalition was in {{its final}} stages; Emperor Napoleon had been {{defeated}} at the Battle of Leipzig by the Allied European armies and was retreating to the borders of France, while the British army under the Lord Wellington had crossed the Pyrenees and was advancing on Toulouse. The French Navy had never recovered from defeat at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 and had made no serious effort to put to sea since the abortive attempt which ended in defeat at the Battle of Basque Roads in 1809. British control of the Atlantic Ocean trade routes was at this stage only contested by the small United States Navy and the handful of French raiders capable of evading the Royal Navy's constant <b>close</b> <b>blockade</b> of French ports, which had operated effectively and almost continuously since {{the outbreak of the}} French Revolutionary Wars in 1793.|$|E
50|$|Postwar Europe {{also served}} {{to play a}} major role in the {{development}} of the modern air cargo and air freight industry. It is during the Berlin Airlift at the height of the Cold War, when a massive mobilization of aircraft was undertaken by the West to supply West Berlin with food and supplies, in a virtual around the clock air bridge, after the Soviet Union <b>closed</b> and <b>blockaded</b> Berlin's land links to the west. To rapidly supply the needed numbers of aircraft, many older types, especially the Douglas C-47 Skytrain, were pressed into service. In operation it was found that it took as long or longer to unload these older designs as the much larger tricycle landing gear Douglas C-54 Skymaster which was easier to move about in when landed. The C-47s were quickly removed from service, and from then on flat-decks were a requirement of all new cargo designs.|$|R

5|$|Troude was wary on {{his arrival}} in the Leeward Islands on 29 March, refusing to {{approach}} Martinique and instead anchoring near the Îles des Saintes until {{the situation in the}} islands could be established. Before he could make contact with nearby Guadeloupe, he was discovered by patrolling British warships and a warning sent to Cochrane, who was on his flagship HMS Neptune off Martinique. Within hours Neptune was cruising off the Saintes, joined by the ships of the line HMS Pompee, HMS York, HMS Belleisle, HMS Captain, HMS Polyphemus and a number of smaller warships that could operate <b>closer</b> inshore. <b>Blockading</b> the Saintes was a difficult task: the French had three channels through which they could escape, too many to be effectively blocked by the forces at Cochrane's disposal. In addition, Troude's force could not be attacked directly, the width of the channels making it impossible for the British ships to attack in full strength.|$|R
