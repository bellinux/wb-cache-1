5|$|Counterfeits and {{spurious}} {{reproductions of}} the 1804 dollar {{have been created}} since numismatists {{became aware of the}} coins' high value. James A. Bolen, a medallist and <b>coin</b> <b>collector</b> who created copies of valuable coins between 1862 and 1869, fabricated an 1804 dollar by altering the last digit in the date of a genuine 1803 example. Although Bolen added his name {{to the edge of the}} coin, other forgers created altered date coins with the intent to deceive. Nineteenth-century stage actor John T. Raymond purchased a specimen of the coin, which was later revealed to be a forgery, for $300. All silver dollars dated between 1800 and 1803 were subject to alteration to 1804 dollars, but 1801 was the date most commonly used for that purpose.|$|E
5|$|Class III {{dollars are}} {{identical}} to the Class II dollar, except lettering similar to that on the Class I dollars {{was applied to the}} edge of the coins. Based on the slightly concave appearance of the Class III dollars, it is likely that all were given edge lettering at some point after striking; as the Castaing machine was meant to be used prior to striking, its improper use resulted in a deformation of the coin surface. Newman and Bressett assert that they were struck at approximately the same time as the Class II dollars, and that the edges were lettered and the coins concealed by Mint employees until 1869, when one was offered to a <b>coin</b> <b>collector,</b> who rejected it as a restrike. However, numismatist S. Hudson Chapman believed that some Class III dollars were struck as late as 1876. In 1875, several were sold by Philadelphia coin dealer John W. Haseltine. Six specimens of the Class III dollar are known today.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} numismatists {{became aware of}} 1804 dollars, they have {{commanded}} high prices, both {{in relation to their}} face value and the numismatic value of other silver dollars. Some early examples were maintained in the Mint's coin cabinet for use in trades, and in 1859, dealers began offering Class II dollars priced at $75, while Theodore Eckfeldt reportedly offered a Philadelphia coin dealer three coins for $70 each. In 1883, a Class III dollar was reportedly purchased in Vienna for $740, and a Class I specimen was auctioned for $1,000 in 1885 by Henry and Samuel H. Chapman. In 1903, an example sold for $1,800, and the same coin reportedly sold for $4,250 in 1941. In 1960, a Class III dollar fetched $28,000 at an auction conducted by Stack's, a coin firm, and the same coin reached $36,000 at another Stack's sale in 1963. A Class I specimen brought $77,500 at a 1970 Stack's, and during a 1980 rise in coin prices, a Class III example sold for $400,000 by Bowers and Ruddy Galleries. A Class I example reached $990,000 at a Superior Galleries auction in 1990, and an example once owned by <b>coin</b> <b>collector</b> Louis Eliasberg became the first 1804 dollar to surpass $1 million at auction, selling for $1,815,000 at a sale conducted by Bowers and Merena, Inc., in 1997.|$|E

25|$|Coins of {{interest}} to collectors often include those that circulated for only a brief time, coins with mint errors and especially beautiful or historically significant pieces. Coin collecting can be differentiated from numismatics, in that the latter is the systematic study of currency. Though closely related, the two disciplines {{are not necessarily the}} same.

25|$|However, the 1988–89 season {{would be}} a big turning point for the franchise. In 1987, <b>coin</b> <b>collector</b> Bruce McNall {{purchased}} the Kings from Buss and turned the team into a Stanley Cup contender almost overnight. On August 9, 1988, McNall acquired the league's best player, Wayne Gretzky, in a blockbuster trade with the Edmonton Oilers. The trade rocked the hockey world, especially north of the border where Canadians mourned the loss of a player they considered a national treasure. McNall changed the team colors to silver and black. Gretzky's arrival generated much excitement about hockey and the NHL in Southern California, and the ensuing popularity of the Kings is credited with the arrival of another team in the region, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (later renamed to Anaheim Ducks in 2006), and the NHL's expanding or moving into other Sun Belt cities such as Dallas, Phoenix, Tampa, Miami and Nashville.|$|E

500|$|Numismatist Farran Zerbe had {{advocated}} for {{the passage of}} the authorization. [...] Zerbe was not only a <b>coin</b> <b>collector</b> and dealer, but promoted the hobby through his traveling exhibition, [...] "Money of the World". [...] Zerbe, president of the American Numismatic Association from 1908 to 1910, was involved in the sale of commemorative coins for over 20 years, beginning in 1892. The Portland exposition's authorities placed him in charge of the sale of the gold dollar.|$|E
500|$|Numismatists Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, {{in their}} {{encyclopedia}} of early commemoratives, {{suggested that the}} [...] "flawed" [...] first specimen was not destroyed, but was given to Ellsworth, a noted <b>coin</b> <b>collector</b> who possessed rarities such as the Brasher doubloon and two specimens of the 1804 dollar. They deemed it unlikely that experienced Mint workers would have selected a flawed planchet {{to use in the}} first strike, and that Ellsworth obtained the piece with Bosbyshell's agreement.|$|E
500|$|Among those {{appointed}} was <b>coin</b> <b>collector</b> and Congressman William A. Ashbrook, 14 times an assay commissioner between 1908 and 1934.

[...] Assay commissioners were traditionally allowed to purchase coins from the pyx that were not assayed, and numismatic historian Roger Burdette speculates that Ashbrook, generally well-treated by the Treasury Department due to his onetime congressional position, might have exchanged other gold pieces for the 1933 coins.|$|E

[...] McAdoo concurred, and wrote to Representative William A. Ashbrook (Democrat-Ohio) on April 16, 1917. [...] Ashbrook was not only chairman of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, he was a noted <b>coin</b> <b>collector.</b> [...] McAdoo explained the need for the redesign, [...] "since the original dies were made the artist has found that they are not true to the original design and that a great improvement can be made in the artistic value and appearance of the coin by making the slight changes the act contemplates".|$|E
500|$|The 1979 meeting, {{attended}} by the government-employed commission members and Mint Director Stella Hackel Sims, was held eight days late on February 22 due to schedule conflicts. In June 1979, Carter's Presidential Reorganization Project recommended {{the abolition of}} the Assay Commission and two other small agencies. [...] The report estimated that having an Assay Commission cost the federal government about $20,000 and that the work was done better by vending machine manufacturers to avoid having their machines jam. In August, columnist Jack Anderson deemed the commission an example of wasteful spending in Washington, characterizing its activities, [...] "more than a decade ago, the government stopped putting either gold or silver in its coins—but the commission continues to hold its annual luncheon meeting. [...] Solemnly, the commissioners measure the amounts of nonprecious metals in U.S. coins, and strike a medal to commemorate their activities. This useless exercise costs the taxpayers about $20,000 a year." [...] As <b>coin</b> <b>collector</b> and columnist Gary Palmer put it in 1979, [...] "who really cares if the weight of a cupro-nickel quarter is off by a grain or two?" ...|$|E
500|$|Alabama half dollars {{were first}} placed on sale on October 26, 1921, {{the day of}} President Harding's visit to Birmingham, Alabama, where he as a Mason laid the {{cornerstone}} for the city's new Masonic temple, and as president addressed a segregated crowd, urging improvement of race relations. Coins were sold from specially-built booths constructed just off the city's sidewalks. It is uncertain whether these coins bore the 2X2 or not. Official records show that all the coins struck in October were of the 2X2 variety, and this was long accepted by numismatic historians. However, one <b>coin</b> <b>collector</b> recalled buying two of the half dollars that day, and over fifty later, all of the plain variety, and averred {{that none of the}} 2X2 could have been sold in Birmingham on the first day. As Owen wrote that the first 5,000 received bore the mark, Swiatek concluded that 1,000 of the October mintage was of the plain variety, all that was for sale in Birmingham. In December, 64,038 more were minted, with 38 set aside for assay. These were recorded to be of the plain variety. [...] Both 2X2 and plain coins were struck from the same die; the mark was ground off to allow coinage of plain pieces.|$|E

500|$|Thomas G. Melish was a {{prominent}} Cincinnati businessman, who had inherited the Bromwell Wire Company. [...] Melish was also a <b>coin</b> <b>collector,</b> {{who came up with}} an idea for a commemorative coin that he would control. At the time, commemoratives were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. The result was the 1936 Cincinnati Music Center half dollar, an issue controlled by Melish and issued to commemorate a fiftieth anniversary that did not exist. Melish sold only a few coins at the issue price, which was high, keeping back most for later sale once scarcity drove the price higher. By 1936, the market for U.S. commemorative coins had become, according to Q. David Bowers, [...] "as hot as a volcano", and [...] "Congress gave [...] permission to have his own commemorative coins minted and to charge the public whatever he liked for them!" [...] Melish, who had friends in Congress, had in early 1936 also tried to get lawmakers to authorize other commemorative issues that he would control. [...] The only one of these that came to fruition was the Cleveland Centennial half dollar.|$|E
500|$|In the 1880s, {{despite the}} return of gold to {{commerce}} nationwide with the resumption of specie payments {{at the end of}} 1878, few three-dollar pieces were coined. [...] There was a small speculative boom by the public in putting aside three-dollar pieces; nevertheless, thousands remained at the Philadelphia Mint. [...] Few were sent to banks; the coins sold for a small premium when banks had some or when they were purchased from exchange brokers. [...] The coins' main use was as gifts, or in jewelry. [...] The pieces were struck only at Philadelphia after the 1870-S rarity, and early numismatist S.H.Chapman noted of the 1879 through 1889 issues, [...] "of the later years of the$3, large numbers were remelted at the Philadelphia Mint." [...] The Mint apparently favored certain Philadelphia dealers in the distribution of the gold dollar, but the three-dollar piece could be obtained without a premium at the cashier's window of the Philadelphia Mint. Large numbers of the 1879 three-dollar piece (mintage 3,000for circulation), 1880 (1,000), and 1881 (500) were hoarded by early <b>coin</b> <b>collector</b> and dealer Thomas L.Elder, who asked bank tellers to look out for them. [...] Elder could not have obtained them directly from the Mint at the time of issue as he was still a child in 1880, and did not begin collecting coins until 1887.|$|E
500|$|Thomas G. Melish, a <b>coin</b> <b>collector</b> and {{entrepreneur}} from Cincinnati, {{came up with}} an {{idea for}} a commemorative coin that he would control and from which he could profit. Melish was a prominent businessman who had inherited the Bromwell Wire Company. He formed the Cincinnati Musical Center Commemorative Coin Association, and secured the introduction of H.R. 10264 on January 31, 1936. This bill would have provided for 10,000 coins from the Philadelphia Mint, 2,000 coins from Denver, and 3,000 from the San Francisco Mint. Such a low mintage would have made the Denver coin a significant rarity, increasing Melish's profit. On February 17, the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures recommended that it be amended to provide for a total of 15,000 coins without dictating at what mint or mints they should be struck. That committee, in its report accompanying the bill, noted that the piece was [...] "in commemoration of the fiftieth (golden) anniversary of Cincinnati, Ohio, as a center of music, and its contribution of the annual May festival to the art of music for the past 50 years." [...] Melish, through political influence, was able to retain the provision that they should be struck [...] "at the mints", allowing coinage at all three mints. This marked the last time that a coinage bill would pass Congress in the 1930s with that phrasing—later issues were limited to a single mint.|$|E
