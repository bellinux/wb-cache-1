25|$|PHEVs {{and fully}} {{electric}} cars may allow for more {{efficient use of}} existing electric production capacity, much of which sits idle as operating reserve most of the time. This assumes that vehicles are charged primarily during off peak periods (i.e., at night), or equipped with technology known as <b>charge</b> <b>control</b> to shut off charging during periods of peak demand. Another advantage of a plug-in vehicle is their potential ability to load balance or help the grid during peak loads. This is accomplished with vehicle-to-grid technology. By using excess battery capacity to send power back into the grid and then recharge during off peak times using cheaper power, such vehicles are actually advantageous to utilities {{as well as their}} owners. Even if such vehicles just led to an increase in the use of nighttime electricity they would even out electricity demand which is typically higher in the daytime, and provide a greater return on capital for electricity infrastructure.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in {{wireless power transfer}} (WPT) technology provide a cost-effective solution to charge wireless devices remotely without disruption to the use. In this paper, we propose an efficient wireless <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> method for exploiting the frequency diversity in multiuser broadband wireless networks, to reduce energy outage and keep the system operating in an efficient and sustainable state. In particular, we first analyze the impact of <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> method to the operating lifetime of a WPT-enabled broadband system. Based on the analysis, we then propose a multi-criteria <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> policy that optimizes the transmit power allocation over frequency by jointly considering the channel state information (CSI) and the battery state information (BSI) of wireless devices. For practical implementation, the proposed scheme is realized by a novel limited CSI estimation mechanism embedded with partial BSI, which significantly reduces the energy cost of CSI and BSI feedback. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed method could significantly increase the network lifetime under stringent transmit power constraint. Reciprocally, it also consumes lower transmit power to achieve near-perpetual network operation than other single-criterion based <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> methods.

3000|$|Rather, PEV owners {{giving the}} system a two-hour window of {{flexibility}} {{in which to}} recharge their vehicles provides much of the benefits that giving full <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> does.|$|R
30|$|Conversely, if PEV <b>charging</b> can be <b>controlled,</b> wind-integration {{costs can}} be {{decreased}} substantially. Importantly, PEV owners {{do not have}} to ‘hand over’ full <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> to the entity operating the power system. Two hours of <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> is sufficient to achieve much of the cost savings. This is because the benefit of <b>controlled</b> PEV <b>charging</b> is in accommodating errors in estimating wind availability. Wind-forecasting errors tend to smooth out {{over the course of several}} hours. Thus, some limited flexibility in shifting PEV-charging loads around within two hours provides almost as much wind-integration benefit as complete <b>control</b> of PEV <b>charging.</b> We expect that a shorter charging window would deliver less benefits than a two-hour charging window and that a longer charging window would deliver more benefits. Our analysis shows that demand response can be used as an effective means of mitigating wind-integration costs and that PEV charging is a natural source of demand-side flexibility. Moreover, the cost savings achieved by <b>controlling</b> PEV <b>charging</b> could be used to remunerate PEV owners for making <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> available to the power system.|$|R

5000|$|During {{times of}} peak demand, the {{electric}} utility prefers {{to reduce the}} demand, rather than turning on additional (dirtier and more expensive) power plants. In places that subscribe to smart power grid services, the electric utility shuts off appliances such as air conditioners until the peak demand is over. Similarly, <b>charge</b> <b>control</b> allows the electric utility to postpone charging until the peak demand is over. <b>Charge</b> <b>control</b> is not as far reaching as V2G (a technology that allows the power company to buy energy back from a plug-in car) but is very effective because it is less expensive to implement than V2G.|$|E

40|$|Wireless power {{transfer}} (WPT) technology provides a cost-effective solution to achieve sustainable energy supply in wireless networks, where WPT-enabled energy nodes (ENs) can charge wireless devices (WDs) remotely without interruption to the use. However, in a heterogeneous WPT network with distributed ENs and WDs, some WDs may quickly deplete their batteries {{due to the}} lack of timely wireless power supply by the ENs, thus resulting in short network operating lifetime. In this paper, we exploit frequency diversity in a broadband WPT network and study the distributed <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> by ENs to maximize network lifetime. In particular, we propose a practical voting-based distributed <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> framework where each WD simply estimates the broadband channel, casts its vote(s) for some strong sub-channel(s) and sends to the ENs along with its battery state information, based on which the ENs independently allocate their transmit power over the sub-channels without the need of centralized control. Under this framework, we aim to design lifetime-maximizing power allocation and efficient voting-based feedback methods. Towards this end, we first derive the general expression of the expected lifetime of a WPT network and draw the general design principles for lifetime-maximizing <b>charging</b> <b>control.</b> Based on the analysis, we then propose a distributed <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> protocol with voting-based feedback, where the power allocated to sub-channels at each EN is a function of the weighted sum vote received from all WDs. Besides, the number of votes cast by a WD and the weight of each vote are related to its current battery state. Simulation results show that the proposed distributed <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> protocol could significantly increase the network lifetime under stringent transmit power constraint in a broadband WPT network.

40|$|The {{lead-acid}} battery which {{is widely used}} in stand-alone solar system is easily damaged by a poor <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> which causes overcharging. The battery <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> is thus usually designed to stop charging after the overcharge point. This will reduce the storage energy capacity and reduce the service time in electricity supply. The design of <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> system however requires {{a good understanding of}} the system dynamic behaviour of the battery first. In the present study, a first-order system dynamics model of {{lead-acid battery}} at different operating points near the overcharge voltage was derived experimentally, from which a <b>charging</b> <b>control</b> system based on PI algorithm was developed using PWM charging technique. The feedback control system for battery charging after the overcharge point (14 V) was designed to compromise between the set-point response and the disturbance rejection. The experimental results show that the control system can suppress the battery voltage overshoot within 0. 1 V when the solar irradiation is suddenly changed from 337 to 843 W/m 2. A long-term outdoor test for a solar LED lighting system shows that the battery voltage never exceeded 14. 1 V for the set point 14 V and the control system can prevent the battery from overcharging. The test result also indicates that the control system is able to increase the charged energy by 78 %, as compared to the case that the charging stops after the overcharge point (14 V). © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
