The tunnel is dug into a sandy hill where a crane stands overhead. A sheet of lightly-colored material hangs from the <b>crane's</b> <b>pulley</b> with a lightly-colored structure standing among the trees behind it. Dirt hills speckled with rocks extend into the background...|$|R

50|$|The term {{comes from}} the days of sailing ships, when a rigger was a person who worked with rigging, that is, ropes for {{hoisting}} the sails. Sailors could put their rope skills to work in lifting and hauling. In an era before mechanical haulage and <b>cranes,</b> ropes, <b>pulleys</b> and muscle power were all that was available to move heavy objects. In time, rigging became a trade in itself, giving rise to modern usages, with its roots all but forgotten.|$|R
25|$|The work is {{important}} for its descriptions of the many different machines used for engineering structures such as hoists, <b>cranes</b> and <b>pulleys,</b> as well as war machines such as catapults, ballistae, and siege engines. As a practising engineer, Vitruvius must be speaking from personal experience rather than simply describing the works of others. He also describes the construction of sundials and water clocks, {{and the use of}} an aeolipile (the first steam engine) as an experiment to demonstrate the nature of atmospheric air movements (wind).|$|R
50|$|Greece is {{the birthplace}} of the theatre as well as democracy. In ancient {{theatrical}} plays every time the plot got too tangled for a rational resolution, catharsis (Greek for cleansing i.e. resolution as in cleaning up the mess) {{came in the form of}} a god (Deus ex machina (translated from Latin as God from the machine)), that descended from above with the aid of mechanical devices such as levers, <b>cranes</b> and <b>pulleys</b> i.e. from a machine, and dispensed resolution to even the most complex of predicaments.|$|R

50|$|BMs can {{be found}} in nearly every duty station {{available}} throughout the United States and various locations overseas. They serve on every Coast Guard Cutter, from harbor tugs to sea-going icebreakers. They are experts in navigation, small boat operations, deck operations, <b>crane</b> and <b>pulley</b> systems, search and rescue, deck maintenance, and small arms. Additionally, in many assignments BMs act as boarding team members (BTM) or boarding officers (BO.) BMs are Officers in Charge of patrol boats, tugs, small craft, and small shore units including search and rescue stations and aids to navigation teams. BMs utilize their leadership and expertise to perform the missions of the Coast Guard, at sea and on shore.|$|R
5000|$|As {{illustrated}} in the graphic to the right, it was the Schramm T-130, Plan B, that reached the miners on Oct. 9. The rescue operation was an international effort. The rescue of the miners involved not only technology, but the cooperation and resources of companies and individuals from around the world, including Latin America, South Africa, Australia, the United States and Canada. NASA specialists helped develop a sophisticated health agenda. Canada brought in their “Plan C” drill. An Austrian system of <b>cranes</b> and <b>pulleys</b> designed for the rescue capsule eventually pulled the miners to the surface. But overall, it was widely a Chilean-led team and effort. As one NASA specialist said while visiting {{early on in the}} rescue: “The Chileans are basically writing the book.” ...|$|R
60|$|It was now early spring--the time {{of going}} to grass with the sheep, when they have the first feed of the meadows, before these are laid up for mowing. The wind, which had been blowing east for several weeks, had veered to the southward, and the middle of spring had come abruptly--almost without a beginning. It was that period in the vernal quarter when we may suppose the Dryads to be waking for the season. The {{vegetable}} world begins to move and swell and the saps to rise, till in the completest silence of lone gardens and trackless plantations, where everything seems helpless and still after the bond and slavery of frost, there are bustlings, strainings, united thrusts, and pulls-all-together, in comparison with which the powerful tugs of <b>cranes</b> and <b>pulleys</b> in a noisy city are but pigmy efforts.|$|R

For this task are made necessary calculations concerning hoist, <b>crane</b> cable, cable <b>pulleys,</b> cable drum. Further, they are drawn strength calculations pin of pulleys, sidewalls, crossbeam and crane hook. Then is also set a drive part of hoisting mechanism consisting of calculation and choice motor, gearbox and brake. The {{result of this}} thesis is drawing documentation of pulley block and manufacturing drawings of individual parts...|$|R
50|$|In {{individual}} cases {{it is possible}} that the construction cranes for a tower or building were left in place and used after the structure was completed. A picture in the Weltchronik by Rudolf von Ems (1340) shows two such load-carrying cranes. One is being worked using a winch, the other using a pulley wheel. A medieval construction <b>crane</b> with a <b>pulley</b> was reconstructed at the Alsace castle of Fleckenstein and set on an eleveted opening in the rock face of the inner ward. The depiction in the Weltchronik also shows material being carried up a wooden ladder.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Pierston, senior, {{it must be}} admitted, {{had been}} {{something}} miserly in his home life, as Marcia had so rashly reminded his son. But he had never stinted Jocelyn. He had been rather a hard taskmaster, though as a paymaster trustworthy; a ready-money man, just and ungenerous. To every one's surprise, the capital he had accumulated in the stone trade was of large amount for a business so unostentatiously carried on--much larger than Jocelyn had ever regarded as possible. While the son had been modelling and chipping his ephemeral fancies into perennial shapes, the father had been persistently chiselling {{for half a century}} at the crude original matter of those shapes, the stern, isolated rock in the Channel; and by the aid of his <b>cranes</b> and <b>pulleys,</b> his trolleys and his boats, had sent off his spoil to all parts of Great Britain. When Jocelyn had wound up everything and disposed of the business, as recommended by his father's will, he found himself enabled to add about eighty thousand pounds to the twelve thousand which he already possessed from professional and other sources.|$|R
50|$|The Chipperfield's Circus Crane Truck (1121) was {{the first}} of the highly {{successful}} and much sought after range of Chipperfield's Circus vehicles produced by Corgi Toys during the 1960s, and was issued in October 1960. It was based on a large International truck fitted with a metal <b>crane,</b> hook and <b>pulley,</b> and painted in the traditional Chipperfield's Circus livery of red and blue, as were all the models in the range. It was followed by the Circus Animal Cage Trailer (1123) in January 1961 which featured two two-part opening doors revealing a large cage with metal bars. These two models were later packaged together as the Chipperfield's Circus Set (GS12). An updated version of the Karrier Bantam Mobile Butcher Shop was introduced in January 1962 as the Circus Booking Office (426). The window insert of the original depicting joints of meat was replaced with a new one with circus advertising posters. In April 1962 the existing Land Rover 109 model was issued along with a trailer carrying a large cage and a model elephant as Chipperfield's Circus Land Rover and Elephant Cage on Trailer (GS19).|$|R
2500|$|Mt. Moriah had {{a plateau}} at the {{northern}} end, and steeply declined on the southern slope. It was Herod's plan that the entire mountain {{be turned into a}} giant square platform. The Temple Mount was originally intended to be 1600 feet wide by 900 feet broad by 9 stories high, with walls up to 16 feet thick, but had never been finished. To complete it, a trench was dug around the mountain, and huge stone [...] "bricks" [...] were laid. [...] Some of these weighed well over 100 tons, the largest measuring 44.6 feet by 11 feet by 16.5 feet and weighing approximately 567 to 628 tons, while most were in the range of 2.5 by 3.5 by 15 feet (approximately 28 tons). King Herod had architects from Greece, Rome and Egypt plan the construction. The blocks were presumably quarried by using pickaxes to create channels. Then they hammered in wooden beams and flushed them with water to force them out. Once they were removed, they were carved into precise squares and numbered at the quarry to show where they would be installed. The final carving would have been done by using harder stones to grind or chisel them to create precise joints. They would have been transported using oxen and specialized carts. Since the quarry was uphill from the temple they had gravity on their side but care needed to be taken to control the descent. Final installation would have been done using <b>pulleys</b> or <b>cranes.</b> Roman <b>pulleys</b> and <b>cranes</b> weren't strong enough to lift the blocks alone so they may have used multiple cranes and levers to position them. As the mountainside began to rise, the western side was carved away to a vertical wall and bricks were carved to create a virtual continuation of the brick face, which was continued for a while until the northern slope reached ground level. Part of the Antonian hill to the north of Moriah was annexed to the complex and the area between was filled up with landfill.|$|R
