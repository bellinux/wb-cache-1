25|$|In Europe {{there exists}} a type of asset-backed bond called a covered bond, {{commonly}} known by the German term Pfandbriefe. <b>Covered</b> <b>bonds</b> were first created in 19th-century Germany when Frankfurter Hypo began issuing mortgage <b>covered</b> <b>bonds.</b> The market has been regulated since {{the creation of a}} law governing the securities in Germany in 1900. The key difference between <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> and mortgage-backed or asset-backed securities is that banks that make loans and package them into <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> keep those loans on their books. This means that when a company with mortgage assets on its books issues the covered bond, its balance sheet grows, which would not occur if it issued an MBS, although it may still guarantee the securities payments.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Covered</b> <b>bonds</b> are debt {{securities}} issued by a bank or mortgage institution and collateralised against a pool of assets that, in case of failure of the issuer, can cover claims at any point of time. They are subject to specific legislation to protect bond holders. Unlike asset-backed securities created in securitization, the <b>covered</b> <b>bonds</b> continue as obligations of the issuer; in essence, the investor has recourse against the issuer and the collateral, sometimes known as [...] "dual recourse." [...] Typically, covered bond assets remain on the issuer’s consolidated balance sheet (usually with an appropriate capital charge).|$|E
