Most work characterizing stress pathways in the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis has been performed on bulk cultures using ensemble assays. However, investigating the single cell response to stress is important since noise might generate significant phenotypic heterogeneity. Here, we study the stress response to <b>carbon</b> source <b>starvation</b> and compare both population and single cell data. Using a top-down approach, we investigate the transcriptional dynamics of various stress-related genes of B. ?subtilis in response to <b>carbon</b> source <b>starvation</b> and to increased cell density.

In contrast, transcription of PHO 87 and PHO 90, encoding the low-affinity H+/Pi transport system, {{is independent of}} the phosphate status. Here, we reveal that upon Pi-starvation, the low-affinity phosphate transporters, Pho 87 and Pho 90, are endocytosed and targeted to the vacuole. Intriguingly, for Pho 87, this process strictly depends on SPL 2, a Pho 4 -dependent gene, while vacuolar targeting of Pho 90 under the same conditions is independent of both Pho 4 and Spl 2. In addition, both Pho 87 and Pho 90 undergo vacuolar degradation upon <b>carbon</b> source <b>starvation</b> {{and the addition of}} rapamycin, independent of PHO pathway signalling. Finally, we demonstrate that the starvation-induced vacuolar targeting of both Pho 87 and Pho 90 is absolutely dependent on their N-terminal SPX domains.

40|$|Almost all {{bacterial}} genomes contain DNA of viral origin, including functional prophages or degenerated phage elements. A frequent {{but often}} unnoted phenomenon is the spontaneous induction of prophage elements (SPI) {{even in the}} absence of an external stimulus. In this study, we have analyzed SPI of the large, degenerated prophage CGP 3 (187 [*]kbp), which is integrated into the genome of the Gram-positive Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy of fluorescent reporter strains grown in microfluidic chips revealed the sporadic induction of the SOS response as a prominent trigger of CGP 3 SPI but also displayed a considerable fraction (∼ 30 %) of RecA-independent SPI. Whereas approx. 20 % of SOS-induced cells recovered from this stress and resumed growth, the spontaneous induction of CGP 3 always led to a stop of growth and likely cell death. A <b>carbon</b> source <b>starvation</b> experiment clearly emphasized that SPI only occurs in actively proliferating cells, whereas sporadic SOS induction was still observed in resting cells.

Dieback occurred despite tree N concentrations were compatible with plant survival: their N stores being blocked in {{the roots and}} woody axes. ContextTree dieback is generally linked to hydraulic failure or <b>carbon</b> (C) <b>starvation</b> but seldom to poor nitrogen (N) resources. AimWe provide here an experimental evidence linking autumn N shortage, C depletion and tree dieback in spring. MethodsYoung peach trees were either N deprived or fertilised in autumn, and then fed in excess in spring. Springsupplies were 15 N-labelled. The effects of the deprivation on tree development, N uptake and C status were then assessed by coupling in situ measurements of shoot development with organ biochemical and isotopic determinations. ResultsAll deprived trees died within 3 months after burst. Bud burst was severely disrupted, and vegetative growth limited {{to the expansion of}} a few leaves. The dead trees absorbed between 39 and 117 mg 15 N in spring, and their roots and axes contained 758 mg more nitrogen than the fertilised trees, suggesting that they did not mobilise their N reserves in spring. They also had lower non-structural carbohydrate concentrations (15. 4 % DW), which were below the threshold accepted for plant survival.

The initiation of transcription at glnAp1 is stimulated exclusively under <b>carbon</b> <b>starvation</b> conditions and stationary phase during which cAMP accumulates in high concentration in the cell. The binding of cAMP to the catabolite activator protein (CAP) causes CAP to bind to a specific DNA site in glnAp1, and glnAp1 is repressed by NRI. Initiation of transcription at glnAp2 requires the activated form of NRI, i.e. NRI-P(phosphorylated NRI), as well as the glnF gene product, σ60 , and it is regulated by NRII.

40|$|AbstractOn {{infection}} of its host, Escherichia coli, bacteriophage λ can follow {{one of two}} alternative developmental pathways: lytic or lysogenic. Here we demonstrate that the “lysis-versus-lysogenization” decision is influenced by guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), a nucleotide that is synthesized in E. coli cells in response to amino acid or <b>carbon</b> source <b>starvation.</b> We found that the efficiency of lysogenization is the highest at ppGpp concentrations somewhat higher than the basal level; too low and too high levels of ppGpp result in less efficient lysogenization. Maintenance of the already integrated λ prophage and phage lytic development were not significantly influenced in the host lacking ppGpp. We found {{that the level of}} HflB/FtsH protease, responsible for degradation of the CII protein, an activator of “lysogenic” promoters, depends on ppGpp concentration. The highest levels of HflB/FtsH was found in bacteria lacking ppGpp and in cells bearing increased concentrations of this nucleotide. Using lacZ fusions, we investigated the influence of ppGpp on activities of λ promoters important at the stage of the lysis-versus-lysogenization decision. We found that each promoter is regulated differentially in response to the abundance of ppGpp. Moreover, our results suggest that the cAMP level may influence ppGpp concentration in cells. The mechanism of the ppGpp-mediated control of λ development at the stage of the lysis-versus-lysogenization decision may be explained on the basis of differential influence of guanosine tetraphosphate on activities of pL, pR, pE, pI, and paQ promoters and by dependence of HflB/FtsH protease level on ppGpp concentration...|$|R

Although its central metabolic pathways are established relatively well, the mechanisms that control the adaptation of its metabolism are understood rather poorly. In this study, clustering of co-expressed genes has been performed {{on the basis of}} DNA microarray data sets from two experimental approaches. In one approach, low amounts of inducer caused a relatively mild perturbation, while in the other approach the imposed environmental conditions including <b>carbon</b> source <b>starvation</b> caused severe perturbed stress. A set of conserved genes was used to construct gene co-expression networks for both the individual and combined data sets.

Module-derived consensus expression profiles enabled the integration of all protein-coding A. niger genes to the co-expression analysis, including hypothetical and poorly conserved genes.
