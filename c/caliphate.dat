5|$|At {{its maximum}} extent, Tang {{expansion}} brought China into {{direct contact with}} the rising Umayyad <b>Caliphate.</b> China's western borders reached the eastern frontier of the <b>Caliphate.</b> Following the Arab defeat of Sassanid Persia in 651, the <b>Caliphate</b> began its expansion into Central Asia, competing with the Tang's sphere of influence in the region. Chinese and Islamic troops finally clashed at the Battle of Talas in 751. The Chinese lost against the Arabs, now under Abbasid rule, and the Arab army captured Chinese papermaking craftsmen. An Arabic record of the conflict claims that the battle led to the introduction of papermaking to the Islamic world.|$|E

These translations were undertaken by the library of the House of Wisdom in Bagdhad. Al-Kindi, Al-Battani, Ibn Sahl, and Ibn al-Haytham flourished under the liberal policies of these <b>caliphates.</b>|$|R

5|$|Abul Ala {{was born}} in Maʿarra, modern Maarrat al-Nuʿman, Syria, {{near the city of}} Aleppo, in December 973. At his time, the city was part of the Abbasid <b>Caliphate,</b> the third Islamic <b>caliphate,</b> and was during the Golden Age of Islam. He {{was a member of the}} Banu Sulayman, a notable family of Maʿarra, {{belonging}} to the larger Tanukh tribe. One of his ancestors was probably the first qadi of Maʿarra. The Tanukh tribe had formed part of the aristocracy in Syria for hundreds of years and some members of the Banu Sulayman had also been noted as good poets.|$|E

5|$|Caliph Abu Bakr died in Madinah, making Umar his successor. Umar removed Khalid from {{command of}} the Muslim army and {{appointed}} Abu Ubaidah as the new commander in chief. In later years, following the Battle of Yarmuk, the Rashidun <b>Caliphate</b> annexed the whole Levant, followed by the conquest of Antioch in 638. By 639, the Byzantines had lost Armenia and Mesopotamia. Emperor Heraclius concentrated on the defenses of Egypt and Anatolia, creating a buffer-zone in Anatolia west of Caesarea by abandoning all the Byzantine fortifications there. The Muslims never invaded Anatolia. However, by 642 the Byzantines lost Egypt and Tripolitania to the <b>Caliphate.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of the {{strategies}} Gandhi adopted was to work with Muslim leaders of pre-partition India, to oppose the British imperialism in and outside the Indian subcontinent. After the World War I, in 1919–22, he won Muslim leadership support of Ali Brothers by backing the Khilafat Movement in favour the Islamic Caliph and his historic Ottoman <b>Caliphate,</b> and opposing the secular Islam supporting Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. By 1924, Ataturk had ended the <b>Caliphate,</b> the Khilafat Movement was over, and Muslim support for Gandhi had largely evaporated.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Khazir (/ALA-LC: Yawm Khāzir) {{took place}} in August 686 near the Khazir River in Mosul's eastern environs, in modern-day Iraq.

It ended in a rout for the Umayyads and the expansion of al-Mukhtar's rule into the region of Mosul.|$|E

5|$|The Siege of Nicaea of 727 was an {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt by the}} Umayyad <b>Caliphate</b> to capture the Byzantine city of Nicaea, {{the capital of the}} Opsician Theme. Ever since its failure to capture the Byzantine Empire's capital, Constantinople, in 717–718, the <b>Caliphate</b> had launched a series of raids into Byzantine Asia Minor. In 727, the Arab army, led by one of the Caliph's sons, penetrated deep into Asia Minor, sacked two Byzantine fortresses and in late July arrived before Nicaea. Despite constant attacks for 40 days, the city held firm and the Arabs withdrew and returned to the <b>Caliphate.</b> The successful repulsion of the attack was a major boost for Byzantine emperor Leo III the Isaurian's recently initiated campaign to abolish the veneration of icons in the Empire; Leo claimed it as evidence of divine favour for his policy. The siege of Nicaea marks also the high point of the Umayyad raids, as new threats and defeats on their far-flung frontiers diverted Umayyad strength elsewhere, while Byzantine power gradually recovered.|$|E
5|$|Abbasid power dwindled {{during the}} 10th century, when the empire {{disintegrated}} and was divided {{among a number}} of vassals.

5|$|As al-Mansur's {{persecution}} intensified, pressure {{began to}} mount on the brothers to react. Kufa, the traditional Alid base, was kept under close surveillance by the Abbasid government, {{and the two}} brothers resolved to launch a simultaneous rebellion in Basra and Medina.

5|$|Constantine IV {{used the}} peace to proceed against the {{mounting}} Bulgar menace in the Balkans, but his huge army, comprising {{all the available}} forces of the Empire, was decisively beaten, opening {{the way for the}} establishment of a Bulgar state in the northeastern Balkans. In the Muslim world, after the death of Mu'awiya in 680, the various forces of opposition within the <b>Caliphate</b> manifested themselves. The Caliphate's division during this Second Muslim Civil War allowed Byzantium to achieve not only peace, but also a position of predominance on its eastern frontier. Armenia and Iberia reverted for a time to Byzantine control, and Cyprus became a condominium between Byzantium and the <b>Caliphate.</b> The peace lasted until Justinian II (r. 685–695 and 705–711) broke it in 693, with devastating consequences: the Byzantines were defeated, Justinian was deposed and a twenty-year period of anarchy followed. Muslim incursions intensified, leading to a second Arab attempt at conquering Constantinople in 717–718, which also proved unsuccessful.|$|E
