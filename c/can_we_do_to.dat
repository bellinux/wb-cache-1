Smith's {{portrayal}} was inspired by an incident that reportedly {{took place on the}} set of Downton Abbey. Ullman: [...] " [...] I heard a rumour that one day she was miserable on the show and they said, 'Maggie, what can we do? What <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> make you more comfortable?'

[...] He added, [...] "But it's been expected for so long. Let's get on with it. The key is what <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> minimize the loss to Minnesota."

2500|$|In 1979, Teresa {{received}} the Nobel Peace Prize [...] "for work {{undertaken in the}} struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace". She refused the conventional ceremonial banquet for laureates, asking that its $192,000 cost be given to the poor in India and saying that earthly rewards were important only if they helped her to help the world's needy. When Teresa {{received the}} prize she was asked, [...] "What <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> promote world peace?" [...] She answered, [...] "Go home and love your family." [...] Building on this theme in her Nobel lecture, she said: [...] "Around the world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove. When I pick up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has been thrown out from society—that poverty is so hurtable [...] and so much, and I find that very difficult." [...] Teresa singled out abortion as [...] "the greatest destroyer of peace today. Because if a mother can kill her own child—what is left for me to kill you and you kill me—there is nothing between." ...|$|E

[...] At this image of their remoteness and the inherent desolation of Boston they could not suppress some sighs, and in the mean time Aunt Melissa stepped into the waiting-room, which opened on the farther side upon the water, and sat contentedly down on one of the benches; the rest, from sheer vacuity and irresolution, followed, and thus, without debate, it was settled that they should wait there till the boat left. The agent, who was a kind man, did what he could to alleviate the situation: he gave them each the advertisement of his line of boats, neatly printed upon a card, and then he went away.|$|E

6000|$|Well, first, {{before one}} answers that, let us ask {{what it is}} exactly that is {{grinding}} the middle class in this way. Is it a process we can stop? Can we direct the millstones? If we can, ought we to do so? And if we cannot, or decide that it isn't worth while, then what <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> mitigate this cruelty of slowly impoverishing and taxing out of existence a class that was once {{the backbone of the}} community? It is not mere humanity dictates this much, it is a question that affects the State as a whole. It must be extremely bad for the spirit of the nation and for our national future that its middle mass should be in a state of increasing financial worry and stress, irritated, depressed, and broken in courage. One effect is manifest in our British politics now. Each fresh election turns upon expenditure more evidently than the last, and the promise to reduce taxation or lower the rates overrides more and more certainly any other consideration. What are Empire or Education to men who feel themselves drifting helplessly into debt? What chance has any constructive scheme with an electorate of men who are being slowly submerged in an economic bog? ...|$|E
60|$|This marring of our speech, however, {{is a minor}} evil {{compared}} with what must follow from the predominance of wealth--acquiring immigrants, whose appreciation of our political and social life must often be as approximative or fatally erroneous as their delivery of our language. But take the worst issues--what <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> hinder them? Are we to adopt the exclusiveness for which we have punished the Chinese? Are we to tear the glorious flag of hospitality which has made our freedom the world-wide blessing of the oppressed? It is not agreeable to find foreign accents and stumbling locutions passing from the piquant exception to the general rule of discourse. But to urge on that account that we should spike away the peaceful foreigner, would be a view of international relations not in the long-run favourable {{to the interests of}} our fellow-countrymen; for we are at least equal to the races we call obtrusive in the disposition to settle wherever money is to be made and cheaply idle living to be found. In meeting the national evils which are brought upon us by the onward course of the world, there is often no more immediate hope or resource than that of striving after fuller national excellence, which must consist in the moulding of more excellent individual natives. The tendency of things is towards the quicker or slower fusion of races. It is impossible to arrest this tendency: {{all we can do is}} to moderate its course so as to hinder it from degrading the moral status of societies by a too rapid effacement of those national traditions and customs which are the language of the national genius--the deep suckers of healthy sentiment. Such moderating and guidance of inevitable movement is worthy of all effort. And it is in this sense that the modern insistance on the idea of Nationalities has value. That any people at once distinct and coherent enough to form a state should be held in subjection by an alien antipathetic government has been becoming more and more a ground of sympathetic indignation; and in virtue of this, at least one great State has been added to European councils. Nobody now complains of the result in this case, though far-sighted persons see the need to limit analogy by discrimination. We have to consider who are the stifled people and who the stiflers before we can be sure of our ground.|$|E
