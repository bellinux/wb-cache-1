Two options for the biomass conversion were studied. The first involved making briquettes of vegetative part of phumdis for use as fodder while the second proposed to pelletise the lower part of phumdis for use as fuel. The study observed that phumdis have nutritional potential as feed material due to its higher crude fibre and <b>crude</b> <b>protein</b> <b>content,</b> but the inorganic content in the root and mat zone was found to be unsuitable for the purpose. The second option of making briquettes from the upper vegetative portion of the phumdis by mixing 12% de-oiled rice bran was found to be feasible for using them as fodder. The lower portion, which was densified to make fuel pellets, was found to be suitable for use as fuel. Such pellets were found to have an average calorific value of 3,400calories per kilogram (14,200kJ/kg) with ash content of 27%. Cost economics were worked out and the study had found it to be “an economically viable and an attractive proposition for the benefit of local population.” The study concluded that extraction of phumdi from the lake could also generate income for the local people who are dependent on the lake for their livelihood. Such a step would protect the lake from the adverse effects of proliferation of phumdis and maintain the ecological balance of the lake, thus converting the waste into wealth. The Planning Commission has also concurred with project proposals to engage interested individuals and private enterprises to begin the commercial venture of manufacturing compost from the phumdis and thus improve the environment of the Keibul Lamjao National Park. The project also envisages removal of 3630 artificial phumdis and compensation to their owners; this is reported to have been implemented.|$|E

It is also used to assay soils, waste waters, fertilizers and other materials. It does not, however, give a measure of true protein content, as it measures nonprotein nitrogen in addition to the nitrogen in proteins. This is evidenced by the 2007 pet food incident and the 2008 Chinese milk powder scandal, when melamine, a nitrogen-rich chemical, was added to raw materials to fake high protein contents. Also, different correction factors are needed for different proteins to account for different amino acid sequences.

50|$|The method {{consists}} of combusting {{a sample of}} known mass in a high temperature (about 900°C) chamber {{in the presence of}} oxygen.

A column containing a thermal conductivity detector at the end is then used to separate the nitrogen from any residual carbon dioxide and water and the remaining nitrogen content is measured. The instrument must first be calibrated by analyzing a material that is pure and has a known nitrogen concentration. The measured signal from the thermal conductivity detector for the unknown sample can then be converted into a nitrogen content.

Calcium contents were reduced to 20 % due to autoclaving. Nitrogen Free Extract (NFE) contents and metabalizable energy contents were significantly modified. Average <b>crude</b> <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> of hatchery waste meal (without shell) and crude fat contents were significantly increased (P< 0. 01) under respective processes. Total ash contents were reduced due to removal of egg shell. Calcium and phosphorus contents were also reduced significantly due to removal of eggshell. NFE contents were markedly reduced when there were no eggshell. Energy contents were significantly increased when there were no eggshell. Overall, results of hatchery waste without shell were better than with shell. However, hatchery waste meal with shell is rich source of calcium. Within processing, there were non-significant differences for all nutrients with no Salmonella and E. coli Average acid values of cooked hatchery waste meal were increased significantly (P< 0. 01) from 3. 04 to 7. 88 after 9 months of storage. Amino acid profile of unprocessed hatchery waste (with shell), cooked processed waste with and without shell revealed sufficient quantity of all essential amino acids, particularly cooked processed hatchery waste (without shell) contained the higher levels of lysine and methionine...|$|R
40|$|Triplicate {{groups of}} {{juvenile}} Oreochromis niloticus (34. 4 g) were fed a commercial diet once, twice, three, {{or five times}} a day for 29 days. Consumption, growth, and feed utilization were eval- uated. No significant differences in growth, feed efficiency, or protein utilization were detected among the fish fed two, three, or five times daily, but all were significantly better than in fish fed only once. Fish fed three meals had significantly higher gross energy and lipid and lower <b>crude</b> <b>protein</b> <b>contents</b> than fish in the other treatments (p< 0. 05). Energy retention in fish fed three times daily (84. 7 %) was significantly higher than in fish fed five times (49. 4 %). Feeding juvenile tilapia nutrient dense pelleted feeds obviates the need for frequent feedings...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of  {{nutritive value}} and In Vitro digestibility of oil palm fronds through fermentation by using  Aspergillus niger  with  different soluble carbohydrate sources)   ABSTRACT. Oil palm frond (OPF) {{is one of}} potential sources of alternative feed, but has limited use due to high crude fiber and low <b>crude</b> <b>protein</b> <b>contents.</b> Fermentation {{is one of the}} methods widely applied to improve nutritive value of animal feed. The purpose of this research is to increase nutritive value of fermented oil palm fronds by adding different soluble carbohydrate source into fermentation media. The results of the experiments indicated that fermented oil palm fronds by Aspergillus niger had a significant effect (P< 0, 05)   on the <b>content</b> of <b>crude</b> <b>protein,</b> <b>crude</b> fiber, and ash. Generally, fermented oil palm fronds with different soluble carbohydrate was able to increase the <b>content</b> of <b>crude</b> <b>protein</b> of oil palm fronds, but not optimal yet in reducing the crude fiber content of fermented substrate. However, the addition of rice bran on the fermentation medium showed the best results, characterized by increasing <b>crude</b> <b>protein</b> and decreasing <b>crude</b> fiber contents as well as improved dry matter and organic matter digestibility, reflected in high concentration of VFA...|$|R
