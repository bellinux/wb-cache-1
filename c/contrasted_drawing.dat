40|$|Cancer {{represents}} {{a collection of}} more than 100 different diseases and continues {{to be one of the}} world’s chief and most complex health concerns. With this challenging context, there is increasing interest in enhancing our understanding of how cancer system performance can be improved. Hampering performance improvement efforts, however, is the absence of an appropriate definition of high performance. Therefore, we set out to define a high performance cancer systemconsistentwith the broader objectives of the Commonwealth Fund’s Commission on a High PerformanceHealth System. Sixteen cancer systempolicy-makers, funders, clinical leaders and health servicesresearchers, representing Canada, England, France, Germany and the U. S., attended a two-day workshop held in London England on 24 - 25 June 2007, where promising performance improvement cancer care policies and practices in each country were compared and <b>contrasted.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on these discussions, the London Framework for Achieving High Performance in Cancer Care was constructed. Performance knowledge provides the foundation for the London Framework, with the need for appropriate measures, quality data sources and crediblemechanisms for reporting performance data to relevant stakeholders. The use of key policy levers including strong leadership, institutional alignment and stakeholder engagement/mobilization further sets the context for practice levers to drive implementation of performance improvement initiatives. Whilethe complexities of cancer systems mean that the basic components of the Framework cannot be easily pulled apart, through our discussion and analysis, these components clearly reflect common strategies and policies that can yield better results. Among these is the critical engagement of clinicians and clinical leaders in the management of quality. Prat Organ Soins 2008; 39 (3) : 207 - 1...|$|E

In <b>contrast,</b> <b>drawing</b> on ethnographic data of anesthetic practice, this article suggests that the techno-logical augmentation of the body required by present-day anesthesia enhances the ability of an unconscious body to convey its needs and shape the course of the anesthetic. In analyzing the expressions of anesthesia’s cyborgs, the author draws on Haraway, Latour, and Suchman to reconsider the characteris-tics of agency and how an unconscious body might “resist ” or inform a doctor’s interpretation. This attempt to explore the nature and distribution of agency within a collective is intended as a contribution to the debates surrounding medical dominance and those theorizing the role of technology in health care...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} open new {{possibilities}} for bioethics, I argue {{we need to}} rethink our concept of nature. The established cognitive framework determines in advance how new technologies will become visible. Indeed, in this dualistic approach of metaphysics, nature is posited as limitless, as material endowed with force which causes us to lose the sense of nature as arising out of itself, of having limits, an end. In <b>contrast,</b> <b>drawing</b> upon the example of hte gender assignment and construction of intersexed infants, I want to suggest for bioethics an understanding of nature that arises not from our scientific explorations, but rather form attending to our situated perceptual encounters with the world which underlie such experimention; these encounters are too easily overlooked, and yet they are crucial for opening up new ways of thinking...|$|R

40|$|This article {{compares the}} urban {{structures}} of early modern Colombo and Cannanore, two South Asian port cities {{controlled by the}} Portuguese during {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries, and taken over by the Dutch in 1656 and 1663. It is argued that, whereas Cannanore was an urban complex marked by a set of walls that separated ethnically and religiously distinct neighborhoods, Colombo, less influenced by regulations emanating from Lisbon and Goa and more exposed to local politics in an unusual historical and military context, developed into a more integrated city surrounded by a single external wall. Although, after the Dutch takeover, Cannanore's urban structure did not change much, Colombo's, on the other hand, was entirely transformed. These <b>contrasts</b> <b>draw</b> our attention to the complexity of urban developments in the colonial contexts of South Asia between 1500 and 1700...|$|R
50|$|An {{element of}} social comedy is {{introduced}} in the second book, which contains a romantic sub-plot concerning the vapid social-climber Irma Prunesquallor. Her preparations for a romantic soiree designed to net her a husband from amongst {{the ranks of the}} Professors and her subsequent wooing by the indolent old Headmaster Bellgrove, provides some light comedy almost in the manner of P.G. Wodehouse. The <b>contrast</b> <b>drawn</b> between their age and unattractiveness and the ardour of their perceived passion is a theme drawn from classical farce. The encounter between Dr. Prunesquallor and the Countess Gertrude when she demands goat's milk, and the subsequent attempts to procure it for her, also provide an element of comedy. These comic interludes are probably intended to provide the reader with some light relief from the otherwise dark and serious themes of the book.|$|R

50|$|A {{jump cut}} is {{a cut in}} film editing in which two {{sequential}} shots of the same subject are taken from camera positions that vary only slightly if at all. This type of edit gives the effect of jumping forwards in time. It is a manipulation of temporal space using the duration of a single shot, and fracturing the duration to move the audience ahead. This kind of cut abruptly communicates the passing of time {{as opposed to the}} more seamless dissolve heavily used in films predating Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless, when jump cuts were first used extensively. For this reason, jump cuts, while not seen as inherently bad, are considered a violation of classical continuity editing, which aims to give the appearance of continuous time and space in the story-world by de-emphasizing editing. Jump cuts, in <b>contrast,</b> <b>draw</b> attention to the constructed nature of the film.|$|R
40|$|Scholarship {{on ancient}} Greco-Roman “magic,” {{over time and}} place, has largely focused on the role and {{identity}} of ritual practitioners, investigating the nature and source of their perceived expertise and often locating it in their linguistic skills. Less {{attention has been paid}} to those identified as the targets of magical rituals, who tend to be described as passive recipients of the ritual or the social power of another. In <b>contrast,</b> <b>drawing</b> on the theory of ritual form developed by Robert McCauley and E. Thomas Lawson, alongside the ritualization theories of Catherine Bell, this article argues that victims of magic were also agents of ritual. Focusing on an experience of hostile magic reported by the fourth-century C. E. orator Libanius, it explores how conceptions of magical power were co-created by spell-makers and their so-called victims and should be regarded as relational, that is, as emerging from the interactions of people and groups...|$|R

40|$|Indian {{concepts}} {{for which}} the terms 'sin' and 'expiation' are regularly given are respectively pāpa and prāyaścitta (Skt.). They are often associated {{with the notion of}} karma: briefly said, the misfortune which one experiences may be explained as being the consequence of one's own acts committed in a previous life and those past actions are termed 'sinful' in English translations. A 'sinner' may however alleviate to some extent the consequences of his 'sins' by practicing 'expiations'. Put into English in this vocabulary, things look familiar, perhaps a bit too much. My argument is that in the context of astrology, what is rendered as 'sin' or 'expiation' corresponds to a more ambivalent conception of wrong deeds, of their consequences, and of the solutions they call for, than what may be found in Christian-inspired cultures. This suggests in turn that the <b>contrast</b> <b>drawn</b> between 'the 'transcendental' and the 'practical' aspects of religion, may not be a very fruitful one...|$|R
40|$|Melodic {{similarity}} is a much-researched topic. While {{there are}} some common paradigms and methods, {{there is no single}} emerging model. The different means by which melodic similarity has been studied are briefly surveyed and <b>contrasts</b> <b>drawn</b> between them which lead to impor-tant differences {{in the light of the}} finding that similarity is dependent on context. Models of melodic similarity based on reduction are given particular scrutiny, and the existence of multiple possible reductions proposed as a natural basis for a lack of triangle inequality. It is finally proposed that, in some situations at least, similarity is deliberately sought by maximising the similarity of interpretations. Thus melodic similarity is found to be plural on two counts (differing contexts and multiple interpretations) and furthermore to be an essentially creative concept. There are therefore grounds for turning research on melodic similarity on its head and using the concept as a means for studying reduction and in musical creative contexts...|$|R

40|$|Two {{parallel}} norms mandate {{an international}} duty to hold state leaders individually accountable for serious corruption {{and human rights}} crimes. The development of these new norms is poorly explained by realist and neoliberal perspectives, {{but there are also}} weaknesses in recent constructivist explanations of norm diffusion that emphasize agency at the expense of structure. Such approaches have difficulty explaining the source of and similarities between new norms, and treat norm entrepreneurs as prior to and separate from their environment. In <b>contrast,</b> <b>drawing</b> on sociological institutionalism, we present a more structural explanation of individual accountability norms. The norms derive from an overarching modernist world culture privileging individual rights and responsibilities, as well as rational-legal authority.

40|$|The post-communist {{privatisation}} {{of state}} flats to sitting tenants has transformed Romania into {{a nation of}} homeowners; yet its popularity appears perplexing given the poor quality of the stock and disappointing, given flat-owners’ subsequent lack of action regarding home improvement. Conversely, self-builders’ proactive agency moved them up the housing ladder. While this striking <b>contrast</b> <b>draws</b> attention to various structural conditions, which have constrained the former and enabled the latter, it also raises intriguing questions on residents’ meanings of home. By interrogating 48 homeowners’ narratives, this paper sustains the multilayered and multi-scalar meanings of home, which intertwine the socio-cultural territory of family and nation; the physical frame of one room or several dwellings; the emotional domain of object-memories; and the ontological realm epitomised by something as minimal as ‘my bed’. Findings demonstrate that flat-owners and self-builders do not significantly differ in their meanings of home but detached houses rather than flats facilitate more fully their appropriation.

In fact, O’Connor’s fundamental-ist prophets are conventions—“loud, startling figures”—she employs to illustrate the distinction of emotional, sentiment-infused Southern fundamentalist Christian religions in which believers can feel salvation, for example, with her belief that good and evil are objective realities in the world rather than matters of the mind and heart.
