In doing so, she effectively sold that property with her husband, for ₤170, to a mining engineer called Charles Rule Williams, who had recently returned from Mexico after working 15 years in silver mines at Zimapan.

The Irish gentry made things as difficult for him as possible, and the path of an avowed Home Ruler installed in office at Dublin Castle was beset with pitfalls. In the internecine disputes that agitated the Liberal party during Lord Rosebery's administration and afterwards, Morley sided with Sir William Harcourt and was the recipient and practically <b>co-signatory</b> of his letter resigning the Liberal leadership in December 1898.

Having turned down several chances to visit, in 1931 he joined a party led by Nancy Astor. The carefully managed trip culminated in a lengthy meeting with Stalin, whom Shaw later described as [...] "a Georgian gentleman" [...] with no malice in him. At a dinner given in his honour, Shaw told the gathering: [...] "I have seen all the 'terrors' and I was terribly pleased by them". In March 1933 Shaw was a <b>co-signatory</b> to a letter in The Manchester Guardian protesting at the continuing misrepresentation of Soviet achievements: [...] "No lie is too fantastic, no slander is too stale... for employment by the more reckless elements of the British press." ...|$|E
500|$|Butler {{announced}} on 6 March 1963 {{that he was}} going to convene a conference to decide the Federation's future. It would be impossible (or at least very difficult) for Britain to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia's co-operation as the latter, being self-governing, had been <b>co-signatory</b> to the Federal agreement in 1953. According to Smith, Field, Dupont and other RF politicians, Butler made several oral independence guarantees to ensure Southern Rhodesia's attendance and support at the conference, but repeatedly refused to give anything on paper. Field and Smith claimed that Butler justified this to them the day before the conference began by saying that binding Whitehall to a document rather than his word would be against the Commonwealth's [...] "spirit of trust"—an argument that Field eventually accepted. [...] "Let's remember the trust you emphasised," [...] Smith warned, according to Field's account wagging his finger at Butler; [...] "if you break that you will live to regret it." [...] No minutes were made of this meeting. Butler denied afterwards that he had ever made such a promise. Southern Rhodesia attended the conference, held at the Victoria Falls Hotel over a week starting from 28 June 1963, and among other things it was agreed to formally liquidate the Federation at the end of 1963.|$|E

2500|$|When {{war broke}} out between Austria-Hungary and Serbia on 28 July 1914, Souchon was at Pola in the Adriatic where Goeben was {{undergoing}} repairs to her boilers. Not wishing to be trapped in the Adriatic, Souchon rushed to finish as much work as possible, but then took his ships out into the Mediterranean before all repairs were completed. He reached Brindisi on 1 August, but Italian port authorities made excuses to avoid coaling the ship. [...] This was because Italy, despite being a <b>co-signatory</b> to the Triple Alliance, had decided to remain neutral. Goeben was joined by Breslau at Taranto and the small squadron sailed for Messina where Souchon was able to obtain [...] of coal from German merchant ships.|$|E

In 2014, Eno again protested publicly against what he called a [...] "one-sided exercise in ethnic cleansing" [...] and a [...] "war [...] no moral justification," [...] in reference to the 2014 military operation of Israel into Gaza. He was also a <b>co-signatory,</b> along with Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Noam Chomsky, Alice Walker and others, to a letter published in The Guardian that labelled the conflict as an [...] "inhumane and illegal act of military aggression" [...] and called for [...] "a comprehensive and legally binding military embargo on Israel, similar to that imposed on South Africa during apartheid." ...|$|E
2500|$|The protests {{captured}} the attention of the world and gained extensive global media coverage. Student leader Joshua Wong featured on the cover of Time magazine during the week of his 18th birthday, and the movement was written about, also as a cover story, the following week. While the local pan-democrats and the majority of the Western press supported the protesters' aspirations for universal suffrage, Martin Jacques, writing for The Guardian, argued that the PRC had [...] "overwhelmingly honoured its commitment to the principle of one country, two systems". He believed that the reason for the unrest is [...] "the growing sense of dislocation among a section of Hong Kong's population" [...] since 1997. Tim Summers, in an op-ed for CNN, said that the protests were fuelled by dissatisfaction with the Hong Kong government, but the catalyst was the decision of the NPCSC. Criticising politicians' and the media's interpretation of the agreements and undertakings of the PRC, Summers said [...] "all the Joint Declaration said is that the chief executive will be 'appointed by the central people's government {{on the basis of the}} results of elections or consultations to be held locally [...]' Britain's role as <b>co-signatory</b> of that agreement gives it no legal basis for complaint on this particular point, and the lack of democracy for the executive branch before 1997 leaves it little moral high ground either." ...|$|E

6000|$|... (M112) To have a {{good case}} on the merits was one thing, and to force it at the sword’s point was {{something}} extremely different. As Mr. Gladstone {{put it in a}} memorandum that became Lord Granville’s despatch, “the question was not whether any desire expressed by Russia ought to be carefully examined in a friendly spirit by the <b>co-signatory</b> powers, but whether they are to accept from her an announcement that by her own act, without any consent from them, she has released herself from a solemn covenant.”(224) Mr. Gladstone, not dissenting on the substance of the Russian claim, was outraged by the form. The only parallel he ever found to Gortchakoff’s proceedings in 1870 was a certain claim, of which we shall soon see something, made by America in 1872. “I have had half an idea,” he wrote to Lord Granville, “that it might be well I should see Brunnow [the Russian ambassador] either with you or alone. All know the mischief done by the Russian idea of Lord Aberdeen, and the opposition are in the habit of studiously representing me as his double, or his heir in pacific traditions. This I do not conceive to be true, and possibly I might undeceive Brunnow a little.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{there is}} no reason for disputing this evidence, none for doubting the honesty of Mr. Dawkins in his despairing account of Charles. He was young, wealthy, adventurous, a scholar. In the preface to their joint work on Palmyra, Robert Wood--the {{well-known}} archaeologist, author of a book on Homer which drew Wolf on to his more famous theory--speaks of Mr. Dawkins in high terms of praise, he gets the name of 'a good fellow' in Jacobite correspondence as early as 1748. Writing from Berne on May 28, 1756, Arthur Villettes quotes the Earl Marischal (then Governor of Neufchatel for Frederick) as making strictures like those of Dawkins on the Prince. At this time the Earl was preparing to gain his pardon from George II., and spoke of Charles 'with the utmost horror and detestation.' His life, since 1744, 'had been one continued scene of falsehood, ingratitude, and villainy, and his father's was little better.' As regards James, this is absurd; his letters are those of a heartbroken but kind and honourable parent and Prince. Villettes then cites the Earl's account of the mission from Scotland (August 1755) urging reform on Charles, through the lips of Cluny. The actual envoy from Scotland cited here is probably not Cluny, but his <b>co-signatory</b> 'H.P.,' and he is said to have met Charles at Basle, and to have been utterly disgusted by his reception. {293} ...|$|E
