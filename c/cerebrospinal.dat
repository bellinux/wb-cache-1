5|$|A {{spontaneous}} <b>cerebrospinal</b> {{fluid leak}} {{is one of}} several types of <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A spontaneous CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches — headaches that worsen in a vertical position and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak). A CT scan can identify the site of a <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, an injection of the patient's own blood {{at the site of the}} leak, a fibrin glue injection or surgery. When the cause cannot be identified the set of symptoms is referred to as spontaneous <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS).|$|E
5|$|<b>Cerebrospinal</b> fluid is a clear, {{colourless}} {{transcellular fluid}} that circulates around {{the brain in}} the subarachnoid space, in the ventricular system, and in the central canal of the spinal cord. It also fills some gaps in the subarachnoid space, known as subarachnoid cisterns. The four ventricles, two lateral, a third, and a fourth ventricle, all contain choroid plexus that produces <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid. The third ventricle lies in the midline and {{is connected to the}} lateral ventricles. A single duct, the cerebral aqueduct between the pons and the cerebellum, connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle. Three separate openings, the middle and two lateral apertures, drain the <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid from the fourth ventricle to the cisterna magna one of the major cisterns. From here, <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid circulates around the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space, between the arachnoid mater and pia mater.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid varies by size and species. In humans and other mammals, <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid, produced, circulating, and reabsorbed {{in a similar}} manner to humans, and with a similar function, turns over at a rate of 3–5 times a day. Problems with CSF {{circulation}} leading to hydrocephalus occur in other animals.|$|E
5|$|Clinical data alone may be {{sufficient}} for {{a diagnosis of}} MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the brain and}} spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation. Testing of <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS. The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.|$|E
5|$|The brain {{produces}} roughly 500mL of <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid per day, {{at a rate}} {{of about}} 25mL an hour. This transcellular fluid is constantly reabsorbed, so that only 125–150mL is present at any one time.|$|E
5|$|The first theory, that of {{increased}} production of <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid, was proposed in early {{descriptions of the}} disease. However, there is no experimental data that supports a role for this process in IIH.|$|E
5|$|Emphasis in Alzheimer's {{research}} {{has been placed on}} diagnosing the condition before symptoms begin. A number of biochemical tests have been developed to attempt earlier detection. One such test involves the analysis of <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid for beta-amyloid or tau proteins, both total tau protein and phosphorylated tau181P protein concentrations.|$|E
5|$|René Descartes {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} dualism to tackle {{the issue of the}} brain's relation to the mind. He suggested that the pineal gland was where the mind interacted with the body after recording the brain mechanisms responsible for circulating <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid. This dualism likely provided impetus for later anatomists to further explore the relationship between the anatomical and functional aspects of brain anatomy.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{contains the}} ventricles where the <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid is produced and circulated. Below the corpus callosum is the septum pellucidum, a membrane {{that separates the}} lateral ventricles. Beneath the lateral ventricles is the thalamus and {{to the front and}} below this is the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus leads on to the pituitary gland. At the back of the thalamus is the brainstem.|$|E
5|$|The {{first step}} in symptom control is {{drainage}} of <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid by lumbar puncture. If necessary, this may be performed {{at the same time}} as a diagnostic LP (such as done in search of a CSF infection). In some cases, this is sufficient to control the symptoms, and no further treatment is needed.|$|E
5|$|When cranial CSF leak is {{suspected}} because of {{discharge from the}} nose or ear that is potentially CSF, the fluid can be collected and tested with a beta-2 transferrin assay. This test can positively identify if the fluid is <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} diagnosis is usually made based on recovery of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the pharynx. Antibodies to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally {{detected in the}} blood of infected patients early in the course of infection. Analysis of the patient's <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid (CSF), which is collected by a lumbar puncture ("spinal tap"), reveals an increased number of white blood cells (primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection of virus in the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio, but rarely occurs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cerebrospinal</b> fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} {{found in the}} brain and spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cerebrospinal</b> fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles {{of the brain and}} contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|During phylogenesis, <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid {{is present}} within the neuraxis before it circulates. The CSF of Teleostei fish are {{contained}} within the ventricles of the brains, {{but not in a}} nonexistent subarachnoid space. In mammals, where a subarachnoid space is present, the CSF is present in it. Absorption of CSF is seen in amniotes and more complex species, and as species become progressively more complex, the system of absorption becomes progressively more enhanced, and the role of spinal epidural veins in absorption plays a progressively smaller and smaller role.|$|E
5|$|People {{with poor}} {{clinical}} grade on admission, acute neurologic deterioration, or progressive enlargement of ventricles on CT scan are, in general, indications for {{the placement of}} an external ventricular drain by a neurosurgeon. The external ventricular drain may be inserted at the bedside or in the operating room. In either case, strict aseptic technique must be maintained during insertion. In people with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage the EVD is used to remove <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid, blood, and blood byproducts that increase intracranial pressure and may increase the risk for cerebral vasospasm.|$|E
5|$|Raised {{intracranial}} pressure, if severe or threatening vision, {{may require}} therapeutic lumbar puncture (removal of excessive <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid), medication (acetazolamide), or neurosurgical treatment (optic nerve sheath fenestration or shunting). In certain situations, anticonvulsants {{may be used}} to try to prevent seizures. These situations include focal neurological problems (e.g. inability to move a limb) and focal changes of the brain tissue on CT or MRI scan. Evidence to support or refute the use of antiepileptic drugs as a preventive measure, however, is lacking.|$|E
5|$|SCSFLS afflicts 5 out {{of every}} 100,000 people. On average, the {{condition}} is developed {{at the age of}} 42, and women are twice as likely as men to develop the condition. Some people with SCSFLS chronically leak <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid despite repeated attempts at patching, leading to long-term disability due to pain. SCSFLS was first described by German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand in 1938 and by American physician Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The CSF {{occupies}} the subarachnoid space (between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater) and the ventricular system around {{and inside the}} brain and spinal cord. It fills the ventricles of the brain, cisterns, and sulci, {{as well as the}} central canal of the spinal cord. There is also a connection from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear via the perilymphatic duct where the perilymph is continuous with the <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid.|$|E
5|$|The Edwin Smith Papyrus, {{an ancient}} Egyptian medical {{treatise}} {{written in the}} 17th century BC, contains the earliest recorded reference to the brain. The hieroglyph for brain, occurring eight times in this papyrus, describes the symptoms, diagnosis, and prognosis of two traumatic injuries to the head. The papyrus mentions the external surface of the brain, the effects of injury (including seizures and aphasia), the meninges, and <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid.|$|E
5|$|The Mongalla region {{suffered}} {{an outbreak of}} <b>cerebrospinal</b> meningitis (CSM) between 1918 and 1924, apparently introduced by Ugandan porters who had served in German East Africa during World War I. CSM caused high mortality for a six-year period as it spread from one family to another. A less devastating CSM epidemic started in 1926, causing 335 deaths in 1928, 446 in 1929 and 335 {{in the first three}} months of 1930 before rapidly dying out.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} {{protected}} by the skull, suspended in <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier. However, the brain is still susceptible to damage, disease, and infection. Damage {{can be caused by}} trauma, or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke. The brain is susceptible to degenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, dementias including Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia and clinical depression, are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions. The brain can also be the site of tumours, both benign and malignant; these mostly originate from other sites in the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} IIH is not known. The Monro-Kellie rule {{states that the}} {{intracranial}} pressure {{is determined by the}} amount of brain tissue, <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid (CSF) and blood inside the bony cranial vault. Three theories therefore exist as to why the pressure might be raised in IIH: an excess of CSF production, increased volume of blood or brain tissue, or obstruction of the veins that drain blood from the brain.|$|E
5|$|The cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, {{and spinal}} cord {{are covered by}} three {{membranes}} called meninges. The membranes are the tough dura mater; the middle arachnoid mater and the more delicate inner pia mater. Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space, which contains the <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid. In the cerebral cortex, close to the basement membrane of the pia mater, is a limiting membrane called the glia limitans; this is the outermost membrane of the cortex.|$|E
5|$|The partial {{pressures}} of oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the arterial blood are measured by the peripheral chemoreceptors – the aortic and carotid bodies, and the central chemoreceptors of the medulla oblongata of the brainstem. The peripheral chemoreceptors are more sensitive to the arterial partial pressure of oxygen than they are to the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The central chemoreceptor is particularly sensitive to the pH of the <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid, which is directly influenced by the partial pressure of {{carbon dioxide in the}} arterial blood.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} to brain {{function is to}} examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cerebrospinal</b> fluid envelops {{the brain}} and the spine, and lumbar {{puncture}} or spinal tap is the removal of {{a small amount of}} fluid using a needle inserted between the lumbar vertebrae. Characteristic findings in Guillain–Barré syndrome are an elevated protein level, usually greater than 0.55g/L, and fewer than 10 white blood cells per cubic millimeter of fluid ("albuminocytological dissociation"). This combination distinguishes Guillain–Barré syndrome from other conditions (such as lymphoma and poliomyelitis) in which both the protein and the cell count are elevated. Elevated CSF protein levels are found in approximately 50% of patients in the first 3 days after onset of weakness, which increases to 80% after the first week.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of a <b>cerebrospinal</b> {{fluid leak}} is {{performed}} {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once the pressure is measured, a radiocontrast agent is injected into the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocephalus (obstruction of {{the flow}} of <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid) may complicate SAH in both the short and long term. It is {{detected}} on CT scanning, on which there is enlargement of the lateral ventricles. If the level of consciousness is decreased, drainage of the excess fluid is performed by therapeutic lumbar puncture, extraventricular drain (a temporary device inserted into one of the ventricles), or occasionally a permanent shunt. Relief of hydrocephalus can lead to an enormous improvement in a person's condition. Fluctuations in blood pressure and electrolyte imbalance, as well as pneumonia and cardiac decompensation occur in about half the hospitalized persons with SAH and may worsen prognosis. Seizures occur during the hospital stay in about a third of cases.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{scientists}} reconstructed an endocast (replica) of an Acrocanthosaurus {{cranial cavity}} using computed tomography (CT scanning) {{to analyze the}} spaces within the holotype braincase (OMNH 10146). In life, much of this space would have been filled with the meninges and <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid, {{in addition to the}} brain itself. However, the general features of the brain and cranial nerves could be determined from the endocast and compared to other theropods for which endocasts have been created. While the brain is similar to many theropods, it is most similar to that of allosauroids. It most resembles the brains of Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus rather than those of Allosaurus or Sinraptor, providing support for the hypothesis that Acrocanthosaurus was a carcharodontosaurid.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, lumbar {{puncture}} {{may be required}} {{if there is a}} suspicion that the symptoms might be caused by other problems (meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage). This is the examination of the <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord; the sample is obtained with a needle that is passed under local anesthetic into the spine. In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary has entered the subarachnoid space. If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRI with a contrast agent) may be required to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels, {{the most common cause of}} SAH.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid has low {{plasma protein}} binding (approximately 31%, but highly variable) and an {{apparent}} volume of distribution at steady state of around 40–50liters. Peak serum concentrations (Cmax) are reached {{one to two}} hours after administration of the drug. Linezolid is readily distributed to all tissues in the body apart from bone matrix and white adipose tissue. Notably, the concentration of linezolid in the epithelial lining fluid of the lower respiratory tract is at least equal to, and often higher than, that achieved in serum (some authors have reported bronchial fluid concentrations up to four times higher than serum concentrations), which may account for its efficacy in treating pneumonia. <b>Cerebrospinal</b> fluid (CSF) concentrations vary; peak CSF concentrations are lower than serum ones, due to slow diffusion across the blood–brain barrier, and trough concentrations in the CSF are higher for the same reason. The average half-life is three hours in children, four hours in teenagers, and five hours in adults.|$|E
5|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} {{is performed}} {{to measure the}} opening pressure, {{as well as to}} obtain <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid (CSF) to exclude alternative diagnoses. If the opening pressure is increased, CSF may be removed for transient relief (see below). The CSF is examined for abnormal cells, infections, antibody levels, the glucose level, and protein levels. By definition, all of these are within their normal limits in IIH. Occasionally, the CSF pressure measurement may be normal despite very suggestive symptoms. This may be attributable to the fact that CSF pressure may fluctuate {{over the course of the}} normal day. If the suspicion of problems remains high, it may be necessary to perform more long-term monitoring of the ICP by a pressure catheter.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause is}} unknown. The {{underlying}} mechanism involves an autoimmune disorder {{in which the}} body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves and damages their myelin insulation. Sometimes this immune dysfunction is triggered by an infection or, less commonly, surgery or vaccination. The diagnosis is usually made based on the signs and symptoms, through the exclusion of alternative causes, and supported by tests such as nerve conduction studies and examination of the <b>cerebrospinal</b> fluid. There {{are a number of}} subtypes based on the areas of weakness, results of nerve conduction studies, and the presence of certain antibodies. It is classified as an acute polyneuropathy.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome depends on findings such as rapid development of muscle paralysis, absent reflexes, absence of fever, and a likely cause. <b>Cerebrospinal</b> fluid analysis (through a lumbar spinal puncture) and nerve conduction studies are supportive investigations commonly {{performed in the}} {{diagnosis of}} GBS. Testing for antiganglioside antibodies is often performed, but their contribution to diagnosis is usually limited. Blood tests are generally performed to exclude the possibility of another cause for weakness, such as {{a low level of}} potassium in the blood. An abnormally low level of sodium in the blood is often encountered in Guillain–Barré syndrome. This has been attributed to the inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, leading to relative retention of water.|$|E
