40|$|This paper {{presents}} a unique solver for nonlinear initial-boundary value partial differential equations (PDE) that integrates with Microsoft Excel as a pure <b>math</b> <b>function.</b> The solver receives via input arguments formulas, variables, and parameters for the PDE, and is executed {{as a regular}} formula command {{in a range of}} cells. The solver, utilizing the method of lines, evaluates to a formatted tabular solution suitable for direct plotting of snapshot or transient views. Design of the solver is made possible by bypassing restrictions that block a worksheet function from receiving and evaluating formulas while preserving its purity. Three examples are presented to demonstrate the merits of this unconventional solver design which shields the tedious algorithmic implementation details from the user, and greatly simplifies solving a PDE using an intuitive <b>math</b> <b>function</b> without any dialogues, macros or VBA programming...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In {{contrast}} {{to most of}} the senior level Artificial Intelligence (AI) courses where AI is taught in the jargon of theoretical computer science with crowd of complex matrix algebra and differential equations, I demystify the subjects and demonstrate that most fundamental ideas behind AI like Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, and Fuzzy Logic, etc, are wonderfully simple and straightforward. I give students team projects as opportunities to be exposed to how intelligent systems are actually built up and implemented. In this paper, we discuss such a project developed by a group of three students for evolving mathematical functions with Genetic Algorithms (GA) in Java. In the project, GA is used to solve a symbolic optimization problem where sequence of instructions collectively forming a candidate <b>math</b> <b>function</b> is evolved to represent a reasonably complicated target <b>math</b> <b>function.</b> Students were very interested and deeply involved in the development of this project since they actually applied the GA theory in practice. And this is the best way AI can be taught and grow, as I sincerely believe...|$|R
