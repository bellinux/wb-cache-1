5|$|Beginning in 1978, {{the economy}} of <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire</b> {{experienced}} a serious decline due to the sharp downturn in international market prices of coffee and cocoa. The decline was perceived as fleeting, since its impact on planters was buffered by the Caistab, the agricultural marketing board, which ensured them a livable income. The next year, in order to contain a sudden drop in the prices of exported goods, Houphouët-Boigny raised prices to resist international tariffs on raw materials. However, by applying only this solution, <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire</b> lost more than 700billion CFA francs between 1980 and 1982. From 1983 to 1984, <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire</b> fell victim to a drought that ravaged nearly 400,000 hectares of forest and 250,000 hectares of coffee and cocoa plants. To address this problem, Houphouët-Boigny travelled to London to negotiate an agreement on coffee and cocoa prices with traders and industrialists; by 1984, the agreement had fallen apart and <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire</b> was engulfed in a major financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny {{adopted a}} system of {{economic}} liberalism in <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire</b> {{in order to obtain}} the trust and confidence of foreign investors, most notably the French. The advantages granted by the investment laws he established in 1959 allowed foreign business to repatriate up to 90% of their profits in their country of origin (the remaining 10% was reinvested in <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire).</b> He also developed an agenda for modernising the country's infrastructure, for example, building an American-style business district in Abidjan where five-star hotels and resorts welcomed tourists and businessmen. <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire</b> experienced economic growth of 11–12% from 1960 to 1965. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew twelvefold between 1960 and 1978, from 145 to 1,750billion CFA francs, while the trade balance continued to record a surplus.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny's {{relationship}} with Kwame Nkrumah, {{the leader of}} neighboring Ghana, degraded considerably following Guinea's independence, due to Nkrumah's financial and political support for Sékou Touré. After Sékou Touré convinced Nkrumah to support the secessionist Sanwi in <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire,</b> Houphouët-Boigny began a campaign to discredit the Ghanaian regime. He accused Nkrumah of trying to destabilise <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire</b> in 1963, and called for the Francophone states to boycott the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) conference scheduled {{to take place in}} Accra. Nkrumah was ousted from power in 1966 in a military coup; Houphouët-Boigny allowed the conspirators to use <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire</b> as a base to coordinate the arrival and departure of their missions.|$|E

5|$|The royal {{antelope}} prefers {{areas with}} fresh and dense growth of shrubs and other plants. It inhabits the warm, moist lowland forests prevalent in western African {{countries such as}} <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire,</b> Ghana, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The animal's habitat also includes forest fringes and secondary forests. Its geographic range extends eastward from the Kounounkan Massif in southwestern Guinea through Sierra Leone, Liberia and <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire</b> to the Volta River in Ghana. The royal antelope may {{also be found in}} the region north to the forested areas of western Africa, which is marked by the interface of forest and savannah habitats.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} as a destabiliser of regimes, Houphouët-Boigny granted refuge to Jean-Bédel Bokassa, after the exiled Central African Republic dictator had been overthrown by French paratroopers in September 1979. This move was met with international criticism, and thus, having become a political and financial burden to Houphouët-Boigny, Bokassa was expelled from <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire</b> in 1983.|$|E

40|$|Infrastructure contributed 1. 8 {{percentage}} points to <b>Cote</b> <b>d'Ivoire's</b> annual per capita GDP {{growth over the}} mid- 2000 s before conflict began to erase the country's infrastructure and its growth contributions. Raising the country's infrastructure endowment {{to the level of}} the region's middle-income countries could boost the growth rate by a further 2 {{percentage points}}. Private sector contracts signed in the 1990 s resulted in improved operational performance and funding for investments in the water, power, transport, and ICT sectors. Impressively, those contracts survived the crisis and delivered uninterrupted service. But private investment flows have decreased since the mid- 2000 s. <b>Cote</b> <b>d'Ivoire's</b> most pressing infrastructural challenge will be to regain the financial equilibrium needed to restore a reliable energy supply. Reestablishing the prominence of Abidjan's port will require investments in terminal capacity and road and rail infrastructure upgrades on hinterland linkages. The underfunding of road maintenance and poor sanitation are additional challenges. <b>Cote</b> <b>d'Ivoire's</b> annual infrastructure spending was $ 750 million in the mid- 2000 s, with going to power sector operations and maintenance. If the underpricing of power and other inefficiencies (valued at $ 200 million annually) were eliminated, the country’s annual infrastructure funding gap would amount to $ 1 billion, and infrastructure goals could be reached within 20 years. <b>Cote</b> <b>d'Ivoire's</b> has relatively good prospects for bridging its funding gap by raising public investment from its low current level, choosing more efficient technologies, and harnessing additional private investment for infrastructure.

5|$|In 1930, Houphouët married Kady Racine Sow (1913–2006) in Abengourou; {{their union}} was {{controversial}} {{because he was}} a practising Catholic and she was the daughter of a wealthy Muslim from Senegal. The families of the two eventually overcame their opposition and accepted the interfaith union, the first ever celebrated in <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire.</b> The couple had five children: Felix (who died in infancy), Augustine, Francis, Guillaume and Marie, all raised as Catholics.|$|E
5|$|The forest cobra occurs {{mainly in}} western and central Africa. It is found from Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, southeastern Mali, Sierra Leone, Liberia, <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire,</b> Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, and Gabon in western Africa to the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, and {{northern}} Angola in central Africa to western Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi in eastern Africa, and to fragmented parts of southern Africa, including the Natal.|$|E
5|$|France's {{intervention}} in the coup was openly applauded by the Central African Republic, Chad, <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire,</b> Madagascar, Niger, and Upper Volta. In fact, France was barely criticised at all in Africa, other than a mild response by Dahomey and one by the Democratic Republic of Congo. The matter was not discussed at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers of the OAU, held on 24 February–29 February in Lagos. The revolutionary movement in French Africa immediately retrogressed following the coup.|$|E
50|$|He {{worked for}} the French {{government}} in Dakar, Senegal, but on returning to his homeland in 1947 became part of its movement for independence. Before <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire's</b> independence in 1960, he was detained for sixteen months for taking part in demonstrations that opposed the French colonial government.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the example}} of de Gaulle, who refused {{proposals}} for an integrated Europe, Houphouët-Boigny opposed Nkrumah's proposed United States of Africa, which called into question <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire's</b> recently acquired national sovereignty. However, Houphouët-Boigny was not opposed to collective African institutions if they were subject to his influence or control.|$|R
30|$|The {{relationship}} between cointegration and error correction {{was found by}} Granger (1981). According to Engle and Granger (1987), the error correction model can correct a proportion of disequilibrium from one period to the next. In the case of <b>Cote</b> <b>d’Ivoire’s</b> cocoa sector, cocoa production in one period may depend on the surplus made by the production factors in the previous period.|$|R
5|$|HIV-1 {{appears to}} have {{originated}} in southern Cameroon through the evolution of SIV(cpz), a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that infects wild chimpanzees (HIV-1 descends from the SIV(cpz) endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes). The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIV (smm), a virus of the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys atys), an Old World monkey living in litoral West Africa (from southern Senegal to western <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire).</b> New World monkeys such as the owl monkey are resistant to HIV-1 infection, possibly because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny began {{drafting}} {{a new constitution}} for <b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire</b> after the country's independence from France on 7 August 1960. It drew heavily from the United States Constitution in establishing a powerful executive branch, and from the Constitution of France, which limited the capacities of the legislature. He transformed the National Assembly into a mere recording house for bills and budget proposals. On 27 November 1960, Houphouët-Boigny was elected unopposed to the Presidency of the Republic, while a single list of PDCI candidates {{was elected to the}} National Assembly.|$|E

5|$|<b>Côte</b> <b>d'Ivoire</b> so that {{he could}} organise {{opposition}} to the Sankara regime. In 1987, Sankara was overthrown and assassinated in a coup. The coup may have had French involvement, since the Sankara regime had fallen into disfavour in France. Houphouët-Boigny was also suspected of involvement in the coup and in November, the PDCI asked the government to ban the sale of Jeune Afrique following its allegations of Houphouët-Boigny's participation. The Ivorian president would have greatly benefited from the divisions in the Burkina Faso government. He contacted Blaise Compaoré, the second-most powerful man in the regime; it is generally believed that they worked in conjunction with Laurent Dona Fologo, Robert Guéï and Pierre Ouédraogo to overthrow the Sankara regime.|$|E
