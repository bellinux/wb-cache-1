The sample population for the study consisted of building administrators and <b>certified</b> <b>staff</b> personnel in three Montana Class “AA” high schools.

This research study provided a greater understanding of the affects that such an implementation had on <b>certified</b> <b>staff</b> regardless of grade level, experience, subject, or gender. ^ This explanatory, sequential, mixed methods study was conducted during the summer, spring, and fall of 2014 - 2015. The study initially gathered data using an online survey, based on Marzano’s 41 instructional elements, in a single class-B school district in Nebraska. All <b>certified</b> <b>staff</b> members within this school district were invited to participate in the survey. Interviews with a randomly selected sample of eight <b>certified</b> <b>staff</b> were conducted following the survey to gain a greater understanding of the quantitative results gained in this study. ^ Patterns in the answers of both quantitative data and qualitative responses indicated a growth in overall instructional understanding. A Paired Samples t-Test was used with Alpha set to. 05. The results demonstrated a statistically significant mean difference between the pre- and post survey scores (t- 4. 89, df – 28, p=. 001). The interview responses added to this understanding by highlighting three main instructional areas that were most impacted within the study: Impact, Consistency, and Engagement. ^ The interview responses and survey data suggested that an overall change had taken affect, although it is one that is more subtly based on improvement and increasing the use of instructional strategies. ...|$|R
