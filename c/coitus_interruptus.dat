5|$|The {{withdrawal}} method (also {{known as}} <b>coitus</b> <b>interruptus)</b> is {{the practice of}} ending intercourse ("pulling out") before ejaculation. The main risk of the withdrawal method is that the man may not perform the maneuver correctly or in a timely manner. First-year failure rates vary from 4% with perfect usage to 22% with typical usage. It is not considered birth control by some medical professionals.|$|E
5|$|In medieval Europe, {{any effort}} to halt {{pregnancy}} was deemed immoral by the Catholic Church, although {{it is believed that}} women of the time still used a number of birth control measures, such as <b>coitus</b> <b>interruptus</b> and inserting lily root and rue into the vagina. Women in the Middle Ages were also encouraged to tie weasel testicles around their thighs during sex to prevent pregnancy. The oldest condoms discovered to date were recovered in the ruins of Dudley Castle in England, and are dated back to 1640. They were made of animal gut, and were most likely used {{to prevent the spread of}} sexually transmitted diseases during the English Civil War. Casanova, living in 18th century Italy, described the use of a lambskin covering to prevent pregnancy; however, condoms only became widely available in the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 9th to early 10th century, the Persian {{physician}} Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi documented <b>coitus</b> <b>interruptus,</b> preventing ejaculation {{and the use}} of pessaries to block the cervix as birth control methods. He described a number of pessaries, including elephant dung, cabbages and pitch, used alone or in combination. During the same period Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi documented the use of pessaries made of rock salt for women for whom pregnancy may be dangerous. In the early 10th century the Persian Polymath Abu Ali al-Hussain ibn Abdallah ibn Sina, known in Europe as Avicenna, included a chapter on birth control in his medical encyclopedia The Canon of Medicine, listing 20 different methods of preventing conception.|$|E
25|$|From {{very early}} times various methods of {{contraception}} have been practiced in Islam, and Muslim jurists {{of the two}} major sects of Islam, Sunni and Shia, generally agree that contraception and family planning are not forbidden by Sharia; the use of contraceptive devices is permitted if the marital partners agree. All the Islamic schools of law from the tenth to the nineteenth century gave contraception their serious consideration. They dealt principally with <b>coitus</b> <b>interruptus,</b> the most common method, and unanimously agreed that it was licit provided the free wife gave her permission, because she had rights to children and to sexual fulfilment which withdrawal was believed to diminish. From the writings of the jurists it emerges that other methods of birth control – mostly intravaginal tampons – were also used by premodern women and the commonest view was that these should only be employed if the husband also agreed.|$|E

2500|$|As {{part of this}} debate, Protestants (as well as some Catholics) {{disagree}} {{over the}} Sin of Onan as found in the Bible verses of Genesis 38:1-10. Protestants within the [...] "children in abundance" [...] group (see discussion of below) [...] often see Onan's act of <b>coitus</b> <b>interruptus</b> as condemning contraceptive use, while most see Onan's real sin as ongoing rebellion against God, with his failure to fulfill the terms of his Levirate marriage (Yibbum) being his final rebellious act.|$|E
2500|$|Pope Paul VI, {{rejecting the}} {{majority}} {{report of the}} 1963-66 Pontifical Commission on Birth Control, confirmed the Catholic Church's traditional teaching on contraception, defined as [...] "every action which, whether {{in anticipation of the}} conjugal act, or in its accomplishment, or in the development of its natural consequences, proposes, whether as an end or as a means, to render procreation impossible", declaring it evil, and excluded. Prohibited acts with contraceptive effect include sterilization, condoms and other barrier methods, spermicides, <b>coitus</b> <b>interruptus</b> (withdrawal method), the Pill, and all other such methods.|$|E
2500|$|Whether condoms {{were used}} in ancient civilizations is debated by archaeologists and historians. [...] Societies in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome {{preferred}} small families and {{are known to have}} practiced a variety of birth control methods. [...] However, these societies viewed birth control as a woman's responsibility, and the only well-documented contraception methods were female-controlled devices (both possibly effective, such as pessaries, and ineffective, such as amulets). The writings of these societies contain [...] "veiled references" [...] to male-controlled contraceptive methods that might have been condoms, but most historians interpret them as referring to <b>coitus</b> <b>interruptus</b> or anal intercourse.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} Middle Ages, the term [...] "sodomy" [...] {{had come to}} cover {{copulation}} between males, bestiality, and non-vaginal heterosexual intercourse, <b>coitus</b> <b>interruptus,</b> masturbation, fellatio and anal sex (whether heterosexual or homosexual); and it increasingly began {{to be identified as}} the most heinous of sins by authorities of the Catholic Church. In Italy, Dominican monks would encourage the pious to [...] "hunt out" [...] sodomites and once done to hand them to the Inquisition to be dealt with accordingly: [...] "These clerical discourses provided a language for secular authorities to condemn sodomy... By persecuting sodomites as well as heretics, the Church strengthened its authority and credibility as a moral arbiter".|$|E
2500|$|Far from abstaining from sex, Baker {{suggests}} that the Lincolns {{were part of a}} new development in America of smaller families; the birth rate declined from seven births to a family in 1800 to around 4 per family by 1850. As Americans separated sexuality from child bearing, forms of birth control such as <b>coitus</b> <b>interruptus,</b> long-term breast feeding, and crude forms of condoms and womb veils, available through mail order, were available and used. The spacing of the Lincoln children (Robert in 1843, Eddie in 1846, Willie in 1850, and Tad in 1853) is consistent with some type of planning and would have required [...] "an intimacy about sexual relations that for aspiring couples meant shared companionate power over reproduction".|$|E

Nandi and Shaka were initially accepted into Senzangakhona's kraal, and she was treated as a lesser wife. As she was not his Great Wife, Shaka was not the heir. Senzangakona was unwilling to acknowledge Nandi as his chief consort, an important status symbol among the amaZulu. He did have another child with her, Shaka's sister Nomcoba. Mkabi, the Great Wife, did, however, treat Nandi well. Nevertheless, Nandi's relationship with Senzangakhona eventually deteriorated, so she and Shaka were forced to leave the kraal.|$|E
2500|$|During this {{formative}} {{period of}} his work, Freud valued {{and came to}} rely on the intellectual and emotional support of his friend Wilhelm Fliess, a Berlin based ear, nose and throat specialist whom he had first met 1887. Both men saw themselves as isolated from the prevailing clinical and theoretical mainstream because of their ambitions to develop radical new theories of sexuality. Fliess developed highly eccentric theories of human biorhythms and a nasogenital connection which are today considered pseudoscientific. He shared Freud's views on the importance of certain aspects of sexuality — masturbation, <b>coitus</b> <b>interruptus,</b> and the use of condoms — in the etiology of what were then called the [...] "actual neuroses," [...] primarily neurasthenia and certain physically manifested anxiety symptoms. They maintained an extensive correspondence from which Freud drew on Fliess's speculations on infantile sexuality and bisexuality to elaborate and revise his own ideas. His first attempt at a systematic theory of the mind, his 'Project for a Scientific Psychology' was developed with Fliess as interlocutor.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Coitus</b> <b>interruptus</b> is {{an example}} of a {{contraceptive}} behavior utilized in Medieval times. This is the case with Onanism, which is clearly distinguished from masturbation. In the biblical telling, Onan was unwilling to procreate with Tamar, so he withdrew before climax and “spilled his seed on the ground”. Masturbation is seen as a form of self arousal, while onanism was viewed as a form of contraception. U.S. Senator, John T. Noonan, has written extensively on this topic and believed that the first certain dated reference to Onanism appeared in the ninth century. The beginning, practices of <b>coitus</b> <b>interruptus</b> has been linked to circles of prostitution and illicit love affairs within the Middle Ages. From there, it took the decisive step towards widespread practice and began entering into conventional sexual relationships, such as marriage. The trigger of this development - assuming other mental and moral conditions - was provided by economic hardship. Population control was not a brand new topic during the time. [...] "If too many children are being born," [...] stated the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, writing of the ideal city, [...] "there are measures to check propagation." [...] Medieval demography has been linked to the church's teaching on birth control. Demographic statistics of the early fifteenth century provide evidence that married couples were limiting the number of offspring they had, likely with such methods as <b>Coitus</b> <b>interruptus.</b> This was particularly true with poor couples and in periods of economic hardship. The purposeful prevention of pregnancy is brought into juxtaposition with the churches moralist denunciation of contraception.|$|E
