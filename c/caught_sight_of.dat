5|$|On {{hearing the}} ambush in the distance, Dodge hurried on toward Fort Hamilton (present-day Wiota, Wisconsin) where he {{gathered}} together {{a company of}} 29 mounted volunteers and sped off to intercept the attackers. He led the chase through tangled underbrush until, breaking into prairie, his force <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the raiding party. The Kickapoo crossed the Pecatonica River {{within sight of the}} pursuing militia, and entered into an overgrown swamp. The militia followed across the swollen river and dismounted when they reached the swamp.|$|E
5|$|Over France, {{the losses}} became quite severe, {{particularly}} over {{the port of}} Brest, France. German defences were strong, owing to Operation Cerberus and Operation Donnerkeil, a joint Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe plan to enable the escape of Gneisenau, Scharnhorst and Prinz Eugen through the English Channel. Five Spitfires and a Mosquito were lost on PR operations in December 1941. The failure to photograph and pin-point {{the location of the}} ships, led to their successful move to Germany in February 1942. It was not until the day of the German operation that a Coastal Command aircraft <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the ships, and by then it was too late.|$|E

However, at that moment, Iwate <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the protective charm that the woman had on her, giving Iwate a great surprise. It was the very same one that she left for her daughter when she left the capital. The woman she had just killed was none other than her very own daughter.|$|E

The two girls stood in the road and laughed till the tears ran down their faces, as they <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> again <b>of</b> the shy, unworldly couple of their parents going on ahead.|$|R
25|$|About 3 years later, {{a certain}} {{traveler}} <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the onibaba, and hearing of this report, Yūkei immediately went to go slay the onibaba, {{and after he}} chased and caught the fleeing onibaba, {{he was able to}} achieve slaying the onibaba. The head of the onibaba was stored in the building that Yūkei constructed, and the body was buried at a certain hill in Oyama, and as a memorial service for the onibaba, a cherry tree was planted there.|$|E
25|$|After {{hearing the}} attack on Apple in the distance, Dodge {{continued}} on toward Fort Hamilton (present-day Wiota, Wisconsin), gathered a company of 29 mounted volunteers on arrival and sped off to intercept that band. He led the chase through tangled underbrush until, breaking into prairie, they <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the raiding party. The Kickapoo crossed the Pecatonica River {{within sight of the}} pursuing militia, and entered into a swamp. The militia crossed the swollen river and dismounted when they reached the swamp and the Battle of Horseshoe Bend ensued.|$|E

After a quick pursuit they overhauled and captured the 150 ton Spanish armed merchantmen Santa Catalina under Captain Martín Francisco de Armendáriz, and the 100 ton escorting frigata Regalo de Dios. At {{the same time the}} other escorting frigata was trapped and captured by Lion and Swallow. The Spanish ships had been bound from Santo Domingo to Havana carrying valuables which included precious stones and hides.|$|E

50|$|Between 1849 and 1866, American whaleships cruised for bowhead {{whales in}} the waters off Okhotsk. Some <b>caught</b> whales within <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the {{settlement}} while others visited the town itself. They also fished for salmon in the Okhota River.|$|R
25|$|Intending to {{give the}} {{appearance}} of Native American aggression, the militia's plan was to arm some Southern Paiute Native Americans and persuade them to join with a larger party of their own militiamen—disguised as Native Americans—in an attack. During the militia's first assault on the wagon train the emigrants fought back, and a five-day siege ensued. Eventually fear spread among the militia's leaders that some emigrants had <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> white men and had likely discovered the identity of their attackers. As a result militia commander William H. Dame ordered his forces to kill the emigrants.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} FireHouse {{can be traced}} back to 1984, when Leverty's band White Heat needed a drummer. After over 20 auditions, current FireHouse drummer Michael Foster {{answered}} the ad and when Leverty was impressed by his skill, he quickly hired him. When the band wasn't on tour, Leverty and Foster would visit rock clubs, and it was at one of these clubs where they <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> a band called Maxx Warrior. Singing for the band was C. J. Snare, and the band's bassist was Perry Richardson. Leverty and Foster were impressed with Snare's vocal ability, and became determined to unite the bands. As soon as Maxx Warrior broke up, Leverty sent Snare some of his songs and asked him to sing on his tape. Foster and Leverty were again impressed, so they brought Snare in to be the band's lead singer for a show in Virginia several weeks later.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after departing German waters on 7 April, Lütjens′ {{force was}} {{attacked}} by British bombers which did no damage to the squadron. On 8 April, Admiral Hipper and the German destroyers were dispatched to Narvik while the German capital ships headed north for a diversionary manoeuver into the North Atlantic. As Admiral Hipper left, she met and engaged the British destroyer [...] which had become separated from Admiral Whitworth′s main force. Though Vizeadmiral Lütjens—and the two German battleships—was nearby, their assistance was deemed unnecessary, and Admiral Hipper sank Glowworm, though taking some damage in return. Whitworth′s main force then <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at 03:30 on 9 April and moved to engage the battleships.|$|E

By his success in this trial, Sittichok signed the loan contract from Chonburi F.C. and became a first team member of Kagoshima United FC since January 24, 2017 for initially one year.|$|R
500|$|... b2. It {{is related}} in some gospels {{that a woman}} was {{condemned}} by the Jews because of a sin and {{was taken to the}} customary place of stoning, in order that she might be stoned. [...] We are told that when the Savior <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> her and saw that they were ready to stone her, he said to those who wanted to throw stones at her: Let the one who has not sinned, lift a stone and throw it. If someone is certain that he has not sinned, let him take a stone and hit her. And no one dared to do so. [...] When they examined themselves and they recognized that they too bore responsibility for certain actions, they did not dare to stone her.

500|$|The {{original}} Broadway production {{opened at}} the Majestic Theatre on April 19, 1945. [...] The dress rehearsal the day before had gone badly, and the pair feared the new work would not be well received. [...] One successful last-minute change was to have de Mille choreograph the pantomime. [...] The movement of the carnival crowd in the pantomime had been entrusted to Mamoulian, and his version was not working. [...] Rodgers had injured his back the previous week, and he watched the opening from a stretcher propped in a box behind the curtain. [...] Sedated with morphine, he could see {{only part of the}} stage. [...] As he could not hear the audience's applause and laughter, he assumed the show was a failure. [...] It was not until friends congratulated him later that evening that he realized that the curtain had been met by wild applause. [...] Bambi Linn, who played Louise, was so enthusiastically received by the audience during her ballet that she was forced to break character, when she next appeared, and bow. [...] Rodgers' daughter Mary <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> her friend, Stephen Sondheim, both teenagers then, across several rows; both had eyes wet with tears.|$|E
500|$|Connecticut {{left the}} New York Naval Yard on 5 December 1907 and arrived {{the next day}} in Hampton Roads, where the Great White Fleet would {{assemble}} with her as their flagship. After an eight-day period known as [...] "Navy Farewell Week" [...] during which festivities were held for the departing sailors, and all 16 battleships took on full loads of coal, stores, and ammunition, the ships were ready to depart. The battleship captains paid their respects to President Theodore Roosevelt on the presidential yacht , and all the ships weighed anchor and departed at 1000. They passed in review before the President, and then began traveling south. After steaming past Cape Hatteras, the fleet headed for the Caribbean. They approached Puerto Rico on the 20th, <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> Venezuela on the 22nd, and later dropped anchor in Port of Spain, the capital of Trinidad, making the first port visit of the Great White Fleet. With the torpedo boat flotilla that had left Hampton Roads two weeks previously, and five colliers to fill the coal bunkers of the fleet, Port of Spain had a total of 32 US Navy ships in the harbor, making it [...] " [...] a U.S. Navy base".|$|E
50|$|Coneys {{remained}} in the vacant house with the occasional signs of his occupation written off as an apparition or local pranksters.

50|$|A {{couple of}} UFOs {{were seen in}} Bulacan {{in the first week}} of May. But it {{disappeared}} and never seen. On May 27, people <b>caught</b> a <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> two UFOs in the middle of the night. Same as the September 2000 UFO sightings, it was red and large like a basketball. Some people said that one of them was at the east and the other at the west, colliding each other and then disappeared.|$|R

In my opinion, whoever hove those things in here <b>caught</b> a <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> us and took us for ghosts or devils or something. I'll bet they're running yet." ...|$|R
500|$|Princess Caroline's {{unconventional}} behaviour led, in 1807, to {{accusations that}} she had had sexual relations with other men since the separation. [...] Caroline was caring for a young child, William Austin, who was alleged to be her child by another man. [...] The Prince of Wales hoped that what was termed [...] "the Delicate Investigation" [...] would turn up evidence of adultery that would permit him to get a divorce, and forbade Charlotte to see her mother. Charlotte was aware of the investigation. [...] The ten-year-old was deeply hurt when mother and daughter <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> each other in the park, and Caroline, obedient to the Prince's command to have no contact with Charlotte, pretended not to see her. [...] To George's bitter disappointment, the investigating committee found no evidence Caroline had had a second child, though it noted that the Princess's behaviour was very much open to misconstruction. [...] The King, who was fond of Caroline, had refused to see her during the investigation, but began to receive her again afterwards. [...] After the conclusion of the Delicate Investigation, the Prince reluctantly allowed Charlotte to see her mother again, with the condition that William Austin not be a playmate.|$|E
500|$|Supported by gentry and nobility in East Anglia and the Thames Valley, Mary's {{military}} {{camp was}} gathering strength daily and, through luck, came into possession of powerful artillery from the royal navy. In the circumstances the Duke deemed fighting a campaign hopeless. The army proceeded from Cambridge to Bury St Edmunds and retreated again to Cambridge. On 20 July {{a letter from}} the Council in London arrived, declaring that they had proclaimed Queen Mary and commanding Northumberland to disband the army and await events. Dudley did not contemplate resistance. He explained to his fellow-commanders that they had acted on the Council's orders all the time and that he did not now wish [...] "to combat the Council's decisions, supposing that they have been moved by good reasons ... and I beg your lordships to do the same." [...] Proclaiming Mary Tudor at the market place, he threw up his cap and [...] "so laughed that the tears ran down his cheeks for grief." [...] The next morning the Earl of Arundel arrived to arrest him. A week earlier Arundel had assured Northumberland of his wish to spill his blood even at the Duke's feet; now Dudley went down on his knees as soon as he <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> him.|$|E
500|$|By {{the last}} quarter of the 11th century, the Byzantine navy was a shadow of its former self, having {{declined}} through neglect, the incompetence of its officers, and lack of funds. Kekaumenos, writing in c. 1078, laments that [...] "on the pretext of reasonable patrols, [...] are doing nothing else but ferrying wheat, barley, pulse, cheese, wine, meat, olive oil, a great deal of money, and anything else" [...] from the islands and coasts of the Aegean, while they [...] "flee [...] before they have even <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> them, and thus become an embarrassment to the Romans". By the time Kekaumenos wrote, new and powerful adversaries had risen. In the West, the Norman Kingdom of Sicily, which had expelled the Byzantines from Southern Italy and had conquered Sicily, was now casting its eye on the Byzantine Adriatic coasts and beyond. In the East, the disastrous Battle of Manzikert in 1071 had resulted in the loss of Asia Minor, the Empire's military and economic heartland, to the Seljuk Turks, who by 1081 had established their capital at Nicaea, barely a hundred miles south of Constantinople. Soon after, Turkish as well as Christian pirates appeared in the Aegean. The Byzantine thematic fleets, which once policed the seas, were by then so depleted by neglect and the successive civil wars that they were incapable of responding effectively.|$|E
50|$|In {{an effort}} to obtain {{precious}} powder for the Continental Army, Cooke ordered Whipple to cruise for a fortnight off Sandy Hook, New Jersey to intercept a powder-laden packet expected from London. He was then to proceed to Bermuda to capture the powder stored in the British magazine there. Katy departed Narragansett Bay on 12 September but <b>caught</b> no <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the packet. Upon reaching Bermuda, Whipple learned that the powder from the magazine was already en route to Philadelphia.|$|R

As I was in the rooms when the shot was fired, it is not {{surprising}} that they should want to investigate my part in the affair rather closely. But there's no cause for alarm.

500|$|Texass {{service with}} the Grand Fleet {{consisted}} entirely of convoy missions and occasional forays {{to reinforce the}} British squadron on blockade duty in the North Sea whenever German heavy units threatened. The fleet alternated between bases at Scapa Flow and at the Firth of Forth in Scotland. Texas began her mission five days after her arrival at Scapa Flow, when she sortied with the entire fleet to reinforce the 4th Battle Squadron, then on duty in the North Sea. She returned to Scapa Flow {{the next day and}} remained until 8 March, when she put to sea on a convoy escort mission from which she returned on 13 March. Texas and her division mates entered the Firth of Forth on 12 April, but got underway again on the 17th to escort a convoy. The American battleships returned to base on 20 April. Four days later, Texas again stood out to sea to support the Second Battle Squadron the day after the German High Seas Fleet had sortied from Jade Bay toward the Norwegian coast to threaten an Allied convoy. Forward units <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> the retiring Germans on 25 April, but at such an extreme range, [...] bringing the German fleet into engagement with the Grand Fleet was not possible. The Germans returned to their base that day, and the Grand Fleet, including Texas, did likewise on the next.|$|E
500|$|Jervis was {{promoted}} admiral {{of the blue}} on 1 June 1795 and appointed to command the Mediterranean Fleet. Unfortunately the Boyne had caught fire on 1 May 1795 and had blown up in Spithead, {{the result of an}} accident, and Jervis lost almost all of his possessions. Jervis went to take command of the Mediterranean fleet in the frigate [...] and once more took Charles Grey's son, Captain George Grey, as his flag-captain. Jervis also took Robert Calder as his captain of the fleet. On arrival at Gibraltar Jervis took [...] as his flagship. Among Jervis' subordinates were Captains Horatio Nelson, Cuthbert Collingwood and Thomas Troubridge. Jervis began a close blockade of Toulon and Nelson was assigned the task of aiding the Austrian army along the Italian coast. By September 1796 the British presence in the Mediterranean had become untenable. Napoleon had beaten Britain's Austrian allies who were in disarray and, in October, Spain had surrendered and allied themselves to the French. Jervis recalled Admiral Robert Mann to aid in the blockade of Cadiz. Mann took his ships instead to Spithead. Jervis abandoned Corsica between September and November 1796 and withdrew his forces to Gibraltar. A Spanish fleet made up of twenty four line-of-battle ships and seven frigates sailed from Toulon on 1 February 1797. Jervis' fleet of ten ships-of-the-line was patrolling off Cape Saint Vincent and was subsequently joined by five more under Sir William Parker. The Spanish admiral, José de Córdoba, had taken his ships into the Atlantic to weather a storm and was making his way to Cadiz when the two fleets <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> each other.|$|E
