25|$|Experimental {{evidence}} {{also suggests}} that gene expression can oscillate with the period seen in dividing wild-type cells independently of the CDK machinery. Orlando et al. used microarrays to measure {{the expression of a}} set of 1,271 genes that they identified as periodic in both wild type cells and cells lacking all S-phase and mitotic cyclins (clb1,2,3,4,5,6). Of the 1,271 genes assayed, 882 continued to be expressed in the cyclin-deficient cells {{at the same time as}} in the wild type cells, despite the fact that the cyclin-deficient cells arrest at the border between G1 and S phase. However, 833 of the genes assayed changed behavior between the wild type and mutant cells, indicating that these genes are likely directly or indirectly regulated by the CDK-cyclin machinery. Some genes that continued to be expressed on time in the mutant cells were also expressed at different levels in the mutant and wild type cells. These findings suggest that while the transcriptional network may oscillate independently of the CDK-cyclin oscillator, they are coupled in a manner that requires both to ensure the proper timing of cell cycle events. Other work indicates that phosphorylation, a post-translational modification, of cell cycle transcription factors by Cdk1 may alter the localization or activity of the transcription factors in order to tightly <b>control</b> <b>timing</b> of target genes.|$|E

50|$|Carbon dioxide {{can also}} be used as an {{atmospheric}} effect on its own. When liquid CO2 is released into the air, typically through an electric solenoid valve to <b>control</b> <b>timing</b> and duration, the carbon dioxide liquid expands to a vapour and condenses the moisture in the air, creating large billowing plumes. When the solenoid valve is closed, the CO2 vapour rapidly disperses in the air, ending the effect nearly instantaneously. This effect can be used for a variety of applications, including simulating geysers of steam, in place of pyrotechnics, or to create an instant opaque wall for a reveal or disappearance during magic acts.|$|E

Internally the non-pipelined bus transferred data between the various parts of the computer, including GIO cards, EISA devices, SCSI and so forth.

40|$|Abstract—Negative-bias {{temperature}} instability (NBTI) and positive-bias {{temperature instability}} (PBTI) weaken PFET and NFET over {{the lifetime of}} usage, leading to performance and reliability degradation of nanoscale CMOS SRAM. In addition, most of the state-of-the-art SRAM designs employ replica <b>timing</b> <b>control</b> circuit to mitigate the effects of leakage and process vari-ation, optimize the performance, and reduce power consumption. NBTI and PBTI also degrade the <b>timing</b> <b>control</b> circuits and may render them ineffective. In this paper, we provide comprehensive analyses on the impacts of NBTI and PBTI on a two-port 8 T SRAM design, including the stability and Write margin of the cell, Read/Write access paths, and replica <b>timing</b> <b>control</b> circuits. We show, for the first time, that because the Read/Write replica <b>timing</b> <b>control</b> circuits are activated in every Read/Write cycle, they exhibit distinctively different degradation behavior from the normal array access paths, resulting in degradation of <b>timing</b> <b>control</b> and performance. We also discuss degradation tolerant design techniques to mitigate the performance and reliability degradation induced by NBTI/PBTI.
