50|$|Ghila pitha {{is a type}} of pancake {{so called}} because of its <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> sized shape. <b>Knee</b> <b>cap</b> is called Ghila in Assamese.

50|$|The {{consequent}} pain {{may lead}} to the cascade of quadriceps weakness, patellar tendon adaptive shortening and scarring in the tissues around the <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> - with an end stage of permanent patella infera - where the <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> is pulled down into an abnormal position where it becomes vulnerable to joint surface damage.|$|R
5000|$|Attenuated {{patella alta}} is an {{extremely}} rare condition affecting mobility and leg strength. It is characterized by an unusually small <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> (patella) that develops out of and above the joint. Normally, as the <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> sits in the joint, it is stimulated to growth by abrasion from the opposing bones. When not situated properly in the joint, the <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> does not experience such stimulation and remains small and undeveloped. Note that the cartilage under and around the kneecap is eight times smoother than ice, so [...] "abrasion" [...] {{may not be the}} best term.|$|R

40|$|Clinical {{studies are}} equivocal {{regarding}} how {{the position of}} the components of an artificial joint replacement influences the function of the knee. Our study used a computational model to demonstrate that the forces at the <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> are very sensitive to changes in {{the position of the}} implant in the thigh bone, especially in stair climbing. The results inform surgeons about the need for accurate component positioning for obtaining proper function of an artificial knee in everyday activities such as stair climbing. More generally, our study establishes the forces at the <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> as sensitive biomechanical indicator for knee function...|$|R

Twenty healthy subjects voluntarily participated in this study.

Two applied directions, heel to posterior of <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> (insertion to origin of calf muscles) and posterior of <b>knee</b> <b>cap</b> to heel (origin to insertion of calf muscles) were applied over both side of calf muscles, respectively. The results had not showed significantly difference in any of the results. The beneficial effects of applied direction of KT has not provided scientific evidence in this study.
