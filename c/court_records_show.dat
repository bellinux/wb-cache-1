5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that all the English witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions, so this one series of trials in July and August 1612 accounts for more than two per cent of that total. <b>Court</b> <b>records</b> <b>show</b> that Lancashire was unusual in the north of England for the frequency of its witch trials. Neighbouring Cheshire, for instance, also suffered from economic problems and religious activists, but there only 47 people were indicted for causing harm by witchcraft between 1589 and 1675, of whom 11 were found guilty.|$|E
5|$|In February 1761 Blackstone was {{considered}} as a potential Tory candidate for the rotten borough of Hindon in Wiltshire. After consultation with friends, he agreed to this prospect – {{at the same time}} refusing the offer of appointment as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. On 30 March 1761 he was returned for Hindon, and took his seat. This did not limit his legal work, initially, with the seat being given without a requirement to attend or vote in a particular way, and the grant of a patent of precedence at the same time actually increased the demand on his time. <b>Court</b> <b>records</b> <b>show</b> him pleading before Lord Mansfield in the Court of King's Bench soon after his election, and acting as counsel in Tonson v Collins, a copyright case, Thiquet v Bath, an important case on international law, and R v d'Eon, acting for the prosecution in a feud over Louis XV's newly appointed cross-dressing Ambassador to the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|Burke's {{third wife}} was Bernadine Burke. In 2012 Court {{documents}} BP Case 126258 (Solomon McDonald Burke) it proved that Burke had never divorced Arch Bishop Bernadine Turner Burke in 1970 before marring Frances Secto, <b>Court</b> <b>records</b> <b>shows</b> no divorce from Bernadine McDonald Burke or Delores Burke.|$|R
50|$|After {{refusing to}} seek {{treatment}} for {{drug abuse and}} mental health issues, Johnson was cut off financially by her family, which led to the impounding of her Porsche, for which <b>court</b> <b>records</b> <b>showed</b> Johnson owed Porsche Financial Services a total of $105,740.93. Johnson was also sued by a nanny service who won a $20,000 judgement against her.|$|R
50|$|In May 1899, Killean {{appeared}} at Blackburn County Police Courts {{on a charge}} of breach of the peace for fighting with a man called Robert Horne in Whalley Road, Wilpshire, Blackburn. He was bound over in the sum of £5 and one surety of the same amount to keep the peace for six months.

25|$|After 15 {{months of}} trial, the jury reached its verdict {{following}} one week of deliberations. Of the 10 remaining defendants {{the jury found}} five not liable. In all, payments for the deaths and injuries totaled more than $210 million and <b>court</b> <b>records</b> <b>show</b> that the case involved more than 1,000,000 documents.|$|E
25|$|Kang Tai's {{report was}} unflattering to Funanese civilisation, though Chinese <b>court</b> <b>records</b> <b>show</b> {{that a group}} of Funanese musicians visited China in 263 CE. The Chinese emperor was so {{impressed}} that he ordered the establishment of an institute for Funanese music near Nanking. The Funanese were reported to have extensive book collections and archives throughout their country, demonstrating a high level of scholarly achievements.|$|E
50|$|Jessica Gibson, Lowe's 24-year-old former nanny, made 12 {{allegations}} against Lowe involving sexual harassment claims and labor-code violations. On June 19, 2008, Santa Barbara, California, Superior Court Judge Denise de Bellefeuille dismissed two allegations regarding labor-code violations {{due to lack}} of legal basis. The legal battle ended in May 2009, the press reported that <b>court</b> <b>records</b> <b>showed</b> that lawsuits filed by both nannies and Lowe were dismissed in Santa Barbara. Attorneys for both women and Lowe sought the dismissals.|$|R
2500|$|Governor Rick Perry {{expressed}} skepticism of Beyler's findings. He {{stated that}} <b>court</b> <b>records</b> <b>showed</b> evidence of Willingham’s guilt in {{charges that he}} intentionally killed his daughters in the fire. Perry is quoted in the report as stating of Willingham, [...] "I’m familiar with the latter-day supposed experts on the arson side of it," [...] and Perry said that <b>court</b> <b>records</b> provide [...] "clear and compelling, overwhelming evidence {{that he was in}} fact the murderer of his children." [...] The Corsicana Fire Department also released a 19-page rebuttal of Beyler's report, stating that the report overlooked several key points that would show Willingham to be guilty.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, former PFC Steven Cabbot Thomas gained further notoriety when he {{was charged}} with being an {{accessory}} after the fact in the murder trial of George Loeb, who was charged with the May 17, 1991 shooting death of an African-American USS Saratoga sailor named Harold J. Mansfield. Both Thomas and Loeb were members of the white supremacist Church of the Creator. Thomas remained free on bond during the trial, and <b>court</b> <b>records</b> <b>showed</b> that in exchange for his testimony he would only serve one year's probation.|$|R
25|$|Regarding his {{statement}} to Barack Obama about intending {{to buy the}} plumbing firm that employed him, Wurzelbacher later said {{that the idea of}} buying the company was discussed during his job interview six years prior. <b>Court</b> <b>records</b> <b>show</b> that Wurzelbacher made $40,000 in 2006. Dun & Bradstreet's report estimated that A. W. Newell Corporation, the full corporate name, had $510,000 in annual sales and eight employees.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{documentary}} {{proof that the}} Red Bull was occupied before 1607, when Queen Anne's Men {{are known to have}} performed there; however, <b>court</b> <b>records</b> <b>show</b> that the theatre was built in 1604, and references in the royal patent for the venue mention Thomas Greene, comedian of the Queen's company, suggest it was built for that troupe. In addition to Greene, Martin Slater, Aaron Holland (a servant of the Earl of Devonshire as well as a Queen's Man), and Thomas Swinnerton were involved in the planning. Perhaps because they had learned from Philip Henslowe's recent problems with neighbourhood opposition in building the Fortune, they did not approach the court for approval until they had already placated their parish neighbours—as Henslowe had—by contributing liberally to poor relief.|$|E
25|$|His early {{sketches}} gained him a {{place in}} the studios of established painters. He worked for three months in the studio of the Flemish painter Ferdinand Elle, who painted almost exclusively portraits, a genre that was of little interest to Poussin. He moved next to the studio of Georges Lallemand, but Lallemand's inattention to precise drawing and the articulation of his figures apparently displeased Poussin. However, Poussin did not fit well into the studio system, where several painters worked on the same painting. Thereafter he preferred to work very slowly and alone. Little is known of his life in Paris at this time. <b>Court</b> <b>records</b> <b>show</b> that he ran up considerable debts, which he was unable to pay. He studied anatomy and perspective, but the most important event of his first residence in Paris was his discovery of the royal art collections, thanks to his friendship with Alexandre Courtois, the valet de chambre of Marie de Medicis. There he saw for the first time engravings of the works of Giulio Romano and especially of Raphael, whose work had an enormous influence on his future style.|$|E
5000|$|In 1987, {{he married}} his third wife, Virginia [...] "Jennifer" [...] Hoffman, an artist 22 years his junior. Her friends began {{complaining}} {{that he had}} sold their works but never paid them. They divorced in 1991. He attempted to expand an interior decorating business - the Sarasota Design Gallery, which sold unusual furnishings and original art - by attracting investors, claiming in a [...] "confidential" [...] prospectus that the gallery was profitable, although <b>court</b> <b>records</b> <b>showed</b> several judgments against him for unpaid bills. He claimed destitution.|$|R
5000|$|He {{worked in}} {{the oil and gas}} industry. He first became {{involved}} in politics around 2002 or 2003, becoming active in a number of Republican political campaigns. In 2014, Shortey established a Republican political consulting firm, the Precision Strategy Group, that reported earning nearly $300,000 [...] "for consulting, direct mail and polling services." [...] The Associated Press noted that <b>court</b> <b>records</b> <b>showed</b> that Shortey [...] "had some past financial difficulties dating back to before his time in the Senate, including an eviction, debt-related lawsuits and foreclosure proceedings." ...|$|R
5000|$|Since then, <b>court</b> <b>records</b> have <b>shown</b> that on Tuesday, January 17, 2006, Mathews County, Virginia indicted Fawley for Behl's murder.

500|$|Little {{is known}} of the jail {{originally}} built by Isaac Hite. <b>Court</b> <b>records</b> <b>show</b> that {{it was to be}} built of hewn logs no less than [...] thick and have at least two cells. The replica courthouse that now stands in Constitution Square was completed in 1942. It houses several personal items belonging to Kentucky's first governor, Isaac Shelby, including his hunting bag, powder flask, surveyor's instruments, and the chair in which he died. The courthouse also contains a portrait of Shelby and some Native American artifacts found in the vicinity.|$|E
2500|$|Maryland {{politics}} could evidently be rancorous. <b>Court</b> <b>records</b> <b>show</b> that Steuart and {{his successor}} as Annapolis mayor, Michael MacNamara, were both required [...] "to post a bond to keep the peace...especially with each other".|$|E

The name of the organisation is not specified. Such accusations have no lawful basis under Ethiopia's domestic criminal law and therefore conflict with Ethiopia’s obligations under the African Charter and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.|$|R

2500|$|In December 1787, Mozart finally {{obtained}} a steady post under aristocratic patronage. Emperor Joseph II appointed {{him as his}} [...] "chamber composer", a post that had fallen vacant the previous month {{on the death of}} Gluck. It was a part-time appointment, paying just 800 florins per year, and required Mozart only to compose dances for the annual balls in the Redoutensaal (see Mozart and dance). [...] This modest income became important to Mozart when hard times arrived. <b>Court</b> <b>records</b> <b>show</b> that Joseph's aim was to keep the esteemed composer from leaving Vienna in pursuit of better prospects.|$|E
2500|$|The only indisputable fact is {{that the}} court of Queen Bona was fed in an Italian fashion, because she {{exclusively}} employed Italian cooks, some of whom were originally hired to prepare parties for aristocratic families but who were soon serving typical Italian dishes as part of the court's daily menus. <b>Court</b> <b>records</b> <b>show</b> that Queen Bona imported large volumes of southern European, American and Western Asian fruits (oranges, lemons, pomegranates, olives, figs, tomatoes), vegetables (potatoes and corn), nuts (chestnuts, raisins and almonds, including marzipan), along with grains (such as rice), cane sugar and Italian olive oil.

2500|$|Records from 1623 and 1624 {{listed the}} African {{inhabitants}} of the colony as servants, not slaves. In the case of William Tucker, the first Black person born in the colonies, freedom was his bright right. He was son of [...] "Antony and Isabell", a married couple from Angola who worked as indentured servants for Captain William Tucker whom he was named after. Yet, <b>court</b> <b>records</b> <b>show</b> {{that at least one}} African had been declared a slave by 1640; John Punch. [...] He was an indentured servant who ran away along with two White indentured servants and he was sentenced by the governing council to lifelong servitude. This action is what officially marked the institution of slavery in Jamestown and the future United States.|$|E
2500|$|The {{anonymous}} Règles de la seconde rhétorique, written around 1400, lists Tapissier {{as being}} among the most famous French poets, singers, and composers of the time. Around the time this account was written, and into {{the first decade of}} the 15th century, Tapissier ran a singing school in Paris; records from the Burgundian court indicate that they sent boys there to learn to sing. The peak of development of the Burgundian court chapel was in 1404, before the death of Philip, when it surpassed in splendor the chapels of the antipope at Avignon and the king of France, and many of Tapissier's students would have contributed to this development. Further <b>court</b> <b>records</b> <b>show</b> that his students [...] "auditioned" [...] for John the Fearless, the new Duke of Burgundy, in 1408, and they performed at services later that same year. Tapissier was dead by August 1410, but no further details on the circumstances have emerged.|$|E

The sentence had previously included a forfeit of US$5 million in cash and a property in Brownsville, Texas. The drug lord admitted to smuggling large shipments of cocaine and marijuana from Mexico to the U.S. while working for the Gulf Cartel. <b>Court</b> <b>records</b> <b>showed</b> that Cárdenas Vela was facing life in prison.

An Oakland police lieutenant described Akbar Bey as [...] "a little street thug" [...] once seen well-armed and wearing a bullet-proof vest in a blatant show of force to the police.

Interestingly, this case was resolved in Aberdeenshire at one of the courts which were still being held at the ancient Stone Circles of northern Scotland.|$|R
