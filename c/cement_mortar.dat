5|$|Treblinka {{was divided}} into two {{separate}} camps that were 2 kilometres apart. Two engineering firms, the Schoenbronn Company of Leipzig and the Warsaw branch of Schmidt–Munstermann, oversaw the construction of both camps. Between 1942 and 1943 the extermination centre was further redeveloped with a crawler excavator. New gas chambers made of brick and <b>cement</b> <b>mortar</b> were freshly erected, and mass cremation pyres were also introduced. The perimeter was enlarged to provide a buffer zone, {{making it impossible to}} approach the camp from the outside. The number of trains caused panic among the residents of nearby settlements.

25|$|The infamous 'Gate of Death' at Auschwitz II for the {{incoming}} freight trains was built of brick and <b>cement</b> <b>mortar</b> in 1943, and the three-track rail spur was added. Until mid-August, 45,000 Thessaloniki Jews were murdered {{in a mere}} six months, including over 30,000 Jews from Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz) and Bendzin Ghettos. The spring of 1944 {{marked the beginning of}} the last phase of the Final Solution at Birkenau. The new big ramps and sidings were constructed, and two freight elevators were installed inside Crematoria II and III for moving the bodies faster. The size of the Sonderkommando was nearly quadrupled in preparation for the Special Operation Hungary (Sonderaktion Ungarn). In May 1944 Auschwitz-Birkenau became the site of one of the two largest mass murder operations in modern history following the Großaktion Warschau deportations of the Warsaw Ghetto inmates to Treblinka in 1942. It is estimated that until July 1944 approximately 320,000 Hungarian Jews were gassed at Birkenau in less than eight weeks. The entire operation was photographed by the SS.|$|E

40|$|Hydro-Quebec {{operates}} actually 476 hydraulic structures {{from which}} more than one-third are made out of concrete. Many of these structures show signs of aging which mainly consist of deterioration of concrete surfaces due to erosion and freeze-thaw cycles. Repair of these deteriorations {{requires the use of}} materials which are available {{from a wide variety of}} manufacturers. Most of the time informations on the various physico-mechanical properties of such repair materials are insufficient or unavailable. This thesis, in addition to furnishing a complete guide on the repair materials and techniques of deteriorated concrete surfaces, gives the results obtained from the inquiry realized among various organizations around the world owners of hydraulic structures together with those from a laboratory study conducted on repair materials not tested previously by Hydro-Quebec. In this particular study, the following physico-mechanical properties were investigated: thermal compatibility with the concrete substrate, shrinkage, permeability, bond strength, compressive strength and freeze-thaw resistance. The results of both the inquiry and the laboratory study show the following: (1) epoxies are not suitable for the repair of the concrete surfaces located on hydraulic structures; (2) <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> and latex-modified <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> are the repair materials which perform the best on hydraulic structures; (3) physico-mechanical properties of <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> are improved when they are subjected to a wet cure while those of the latex-modified <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> are when they are subjected to 24 hours wet cure followed by a dry one; (4) <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> are generally more thermal compatible with concrete substrates when compared to latex-modified cement mortars; (5) shrinkage, which is generally larger on latex-modified <b>cement</b> <b>mortars,</b> greatly influence the performance of repair mortars...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to utilize waste PG as an {{admixture}} for concrete products cured by steam. For the study, waste PG was classified into 4 forms (dehydrate, ÃŽÂ²-hemihydrate, III-anhydrite, and II-anhydrite), which were calcined at various temperatures. Also, various admixtures were prepared with PG, fly-ash (FA), and granulated blast-furnace slag (BFS). The basic properties of <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> containing these admixtures were analyzed and examined through X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, compressive strength, and acid corrosion resistance. According to the results, <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> made with III-anhydrite of waste PG and BFS exhibited strength similar to that of <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> made with II-anhydrite.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of alkali-activated granulated {{blast furnace slag}} (AAS) <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> with reactive aggregate due to alkali–silica reaction (ASR) was investigated. The alkaline activator used was NaOH solution with 4 % Na 2 O (by mass of slag). These results were compared to those of ordinary portland <b>cement</b> (OPC) <b>mortars.</b> The ASTM C 1260 - 94 Standard Test Method based on the NBRI Accelerated Test Method was followed. The nature of the ASR products was also studied by SEM/EDX. The results obtained show that the AAS <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> experienced expansion due to the ASR, but expansion occurs at slower rate than with OPC mortars under similar conditions. The cause of the expansion in AAS <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> is the formation of sodium and calcium silicate hydrate reaction products with rosette-type morphology.

40|$|The {{recycling}} of waste glass {{is a major}} problem for municipalities worldwide. The problem concerns especially colored waste glass which, due to its low recycling rate as result of high level of impurity, has mostly been dumped into landfills. In recent years, a new use was found for it: instead of creating waste, it can be recycled as an additive in building materials. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the possibility of manufacturing sustainable and self-cleaning <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> with use of commercially available nanomaterials and brown soda-lime waste glass. Mechanical and bactericidal properties of <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> containing brown soda-lime waste glass and commercially available nanomaterials (amorphous nanosilica and cement containing nanocrystalline titanium dioxide) were analyzed in terms of waste glass content and the effectiveness of nanomaterials. Quartz sand is replaced with brown waste glass at ratios of 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % by weight. Study has shown that waste glass can act as a successful replacement for sand (up to 100 %) to produce <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> while nanosilica is incorporated.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} hydrogen-rich water (HRW) on the strength and durability of Portland <b>cement</b> <b>mortars.</b> We comparatively assessed the performances of HRW-based mortars (HWMs) with respect to <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> fabricated from control water (CWM). The {{results indicate that the}} use of HRW significantly improves the compressive, flexural, and splitting tensile strength of mortars at both the early and later ages of curing. Durability was assessed in terms of capillary absorption, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), dynamic elastic modulus (DEM), and electrical resistivity (ER). We attribute the generally improved mechanical and durability properties of HWMs to the formation of more cement hydrates with fewer voids in the hydrogen-rich environment. Based on X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses, we deduce that the use of HRW in Portland <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> produces a more compact, dense, and durable microstructure with fewer voids due to a higher degree of hydration...|$|R

Therefore, the required specimen dimensions, transducer frequencies have not yet been established for <b>cement</b> <b>mortars.</b> In this study, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) of mortars was determined with different transducers of different frequencies for different size and shape of specimens and the relations between UPV and various properties of <b>cement</b> <b>mortars</b> were investigated.

For this purpose, mortar mixtures were prepared with various water-to-cement ratios having a constant cement content of 500 kg/m 3. From each mortar mixture, cubical and prismatic specimens of various sizes were prepared. It was concluded that when the effect of specimen geometry on the UPV of mortars were considered, as the path length increases there is a significant reduction in the measured UPV, and when the length/wavelength ratio increases, the measured UPV with different transducer frequencies tends to converge to a single value. It was also observed that the linear relationship that exists between the compressive strength and UPV varies, as the age of mortar increases...|$|R
