The staff there analyzed satellite telephone signals (like Inmarsat) from all over the Middle East.

40|$|In {{the last}} lecture {{we started our}} {{discussion}} on proof search strategies with inversion, which applies to negative connectives on the right or positive connectives on the left of a sequent. Another strategy I <b>call</b> <b>chaining</b> (also called weak focusing [Lau 04]) does not care about inversion, but forces a certain discipline on the non-invertible rules. The idea is that non-invertible rules can can only be applied to formulas in focus, and at most one formula can be in focus {{at a time in}} a sequent. Chaining, which has forward chaining and backward chaining as special cases, is at least equally powerful and perhaps more surprising than inversion. If we put the two together we get a system called focusing, which inherits its restrictions from both inversion and chaining. But first, chaining. ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{software}} engineering applications utilize static program analyses to gain information about programs. Some applications perform static analysis {{over the whole}} program's call graph, while others {{are more interested in}} specific <b>call</b> <b>chains</b> within a program's call graph. A particular static <b>call</b> <b>chain</b> for an object-oriented program may in fact be impossible to execute, or infeasible, such that there is no input for which the chain will be taken. Identifying infeasible static <b>call</b> <b>chains</b> can save time and resources with respect to the targeted software development tool. This paper examines type infeasibility of <b>call</b> <b>chains,</b> which may be caused by inherently polymorphic call sites and are sometimes due to imprecision in call graphs. The problem of determining whether a <b>call</b> <b>chain</b> is type infeasible is defined and exemplified, and a key property characterizing type infeasible <b>call</b> <b>chains</b> is described. An empirical study was performed on a set of Java programs, and results from examining the call graphs of these programs are presented. Finally, an algorithm that automatically determines the type infeasibility of a <b>call</b> <b>chain</b> due to object parameters is presented...|$|R

40|$|Current {{software}} development techniques and tools lack {{the capability to}} characterize function <b>call</b> <b>chains</b> in multithreaded and distributed applications built upon component technologies like CORBA, COM and J 2 EE. The root cause is that causal linkage information necessary to trace end-to-end <b>call</b> <b>chains</b> is private to each vendor’s runtime and often unavailable for logging or analysis. We propose and demonstrate a mechanism for maintaining and correlating global causality information of component-based applications, and using this information to expose and characterize function <b>call</b> <b>chains</b> and their associated behaviors in such multithreaded and distributed applications. Our approach relies on a global virtual tunnel facilitated by the instrumented stubs and skeletons. This tunnel maintains and correlates causal information throughout the end-toend <b>call</b> <b>chains</b> spanning threads, processes and processors. As a result, monitoring data captured locally can be correlated and system-wide propagation of timing latency and CPU utilization becomes perceivable. 1...|$|R
