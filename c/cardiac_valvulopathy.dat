25|$|Lorcaserin is a {{full agonist}} for 5-HT2C and 5-HT2B receptors and partial agonist for 5-HT2A receptors (75% of the maximal {{response}} elicited by serotonin). Lorcaserin is a potent and selective 5-HT2C agonist with rapid oral absorption that shows dose-dependent decrease in food intake and body weight. Lorcaserin affects body weight by producing a negative energy balance through reduced food intake (energy intake) without alterations in energy expenditure and substrate oxidation. Lorcaserin has a high affinity for the 5-HT2C receptors, with 18-fold selectivity over 5-HT2A receptors and 104-fold over 5-HT2B receptors. The predicted blood concentration to stimulate 2A and 2B receptors is approximately 1400-fold for 2B and 250-fold for 2A, above the blood concentration that is required to stimulate the 2C receptors. This functional selectivity is critical to prevent potential side effects and suggests that the theoretical risk of <b>cardiac</b> <b>valvulopathy</b> is very low. Clinical trials have supported this theory since they have not revealed any side effects on heart valves or pulmonary artery pressure like the former obesity drugs.

40|$|Abstract Post-operatory wound {{infections are}} a very {{uncommon}} finding after thyroidectomy. For these reasons international guidelines do not routinely recommend systemic antibiotic prophylaxis. The benefits of this antibiotic prophylaxis is not supported by clinical evidence in the literature. We have conducted a multicentric randomized double-blind trial on 500 patients who had undergone thyroidectomy for goitre or thyroid carcinoma. The 500 patients enrolled in the study (mean age 47 years) were randomized in two subgroups of 250 patients. 250 patients were treated with standard antibiotic prophylaxis with sulbactam/ampicillin 1 fl (3 gr.) 30 min before surgery. No antibiotic prophylaxis was instituted in the remainder 250 patients.

For a correct diagnostic evaluation of cardianc valves, and in particular of rheumatic valvulopathy, pathologists should know the patient's clinical history, the degree of insufficiency and/or stenosis and echographiacal data. Histopathologic features of rheumatic valvulopathy include precocious, tardy and terminal lesions. Rheumatic valvulopathy may produce mitral insufficiency. Mitral valve incompetence has been calssified into three types by echography (Carpentier, 1980). 56 cases of valvular samples have been examinated at our institution from January 2004 to January 2008. Any case was processed according to diagnostic/opeartive protocol we prepared carefully: gross examination, photographic documentation, sampling, standard stains and histochemical special stains. On the basis of the operative diagnostic protocol, histopathologic diagnosis of rheumatic valvulopathy was effected in three cases. Special methods of histochemistry, in addition to hematoxylin and eosin, are fundamental for the differential diagnosis of valvulopathies. Histopathologic diagnosis of rheumatic valvulopathy is complex and requests several histomorphologic data: our operative diagnostic protocol is extremely useful to reach an anatomo-pathologic diagnosis of surgical sample, which constitutes an essential element to confirm preoperative clinical-echographic diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Since first being {{described}} in 1948, serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) {{has been discovered}} to exert effects on {{a vast array of}} organs and bodily functions. Cardiovascular effects of serotonin were observed in vivo shortly thereafter, but knowledge about the biochemical processes on receptor level was lacking. By the early 1990 s, technological advances had led to the discovery of several families and subtypes of the serotonin receptor, and several lines of research were started to assess the effects of serotonin on the fetal and adult heart. Serotonin was, through the 5 -HT 2 B receptor, found to play a vital part in the cardiac embryogenesis, by instigating migratory, morphogenic and trophic responses in the developing heart. In a mouse model, deletion of the gene coding for the 5 -HT 2 B receptor was associated with an increase in perinatal mortality. Overstimulation of the 5 -HT 2 B receptor in the adult human heart has been shown to induce <b>cardiac</b> <b>valvulopathies,</b> particularly in the form of regurgitations, and ventricular hypertrophy, with subsequent cardiac fibrosis, predisposing heart failure. Results have shown that the 5 -HT 4 receptor is of particular importance in cardiac remodeling following manifest heart failure, with the receptor being upregulated and its inotropic effect potentiated, thus increasing myocardial oxygen consumption. Based on experimental findings, it has been hypothesized that selective serotonin antagonism might prove beneficial in the failing heart. However, preliminary experimental studies in animals have shown a lesser treatment effect than expected.

On July 8, 1997, 24 cases of valvular heart disease in {{women who had been}} treated with fenfluramine and phentermine were publicly reported (1). Although valvular lesions were observed {{on both sides of the}} heart, a leftsided valve was affected in all cases. The histopathologic features were similar to those observed in carcinoid-induced valvular disease, a serotonin-related syndrome.

40|$|Background—Serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine; 5 -HT) {{overproduction}} {{is responsible}} for cardiac valvular disease in patients with carcinoid tumors. Reduced 5 -HT inactivation is one proposed mechanism of the valvulopathy observed in individuals treated with the appetite suppressants fenfluramine and phentermine. One key protein limiting systemic availability of 5 -HT is the 5 -HT transporter (5 -HTT) expressed by platelets and pulmonary vascular cells; 5 -HTT {{is responsible for}} 5 -HT uptake and subsequent inactivation of the amine passing through the lung. Here we investigated whether 5 -HTT–deficient (5 -HTT-KO) mice developed structural and/or functional <b>cardiac</b> abnormalities and <b>valvulopathy.</b> Methods and Results—Cardiac endothelial cells expressed large amounts of 5 -HTT in wild-type mice. 5 -HTT deficiency appeared {{to be associated with}} marked interstitial, perivascular, and valvular fibrosis as evidenced by staining of cardiac collagen in 5 -HTT-KO mice. Histological analysis provided evidence for valvulopathy characterized by valvular hyperplasia and prominent fibrosis at the attachment site and base of the leaflets. Echocardiography revealed an increase in left ventricular lumen diameter and a decrease in left ventricular diameter fractional shortening. Although 5 -HT 1 B receptors mediated the 5 -HT–induced collagen secretion by human cardiac myofibroblasts, the contribution of this receptor type to valvulopathy was ruled out because double-KO mice deficient in both 5 -HTT and 5 -HT 1 B receptors showed the same cardiac alterations as 5 -HTT-KO mice...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Analyses of {{healthcare}} data from 30 million individuals in three countries showed that current use of bisphosphonates {{may be associated}} with a small increased risk of <b>cardiac</b> <b>valvulopathy</b> (vs. those not exposed within the previous year), although confounding cannot be entirely ruled out. The observed tendency for decreased valvulopathy risk with cumulative duration of bisphosphonate use > 6  months may even indicate a protective effect with prolonged use. Further studies are still needed to evaluate whether bisphosphonates increase or decrease the risk of valvulopathy. Introduction: A signal of cardiac valve disorders with use of bisphosphonates was identified in the literature and EudraVigilance database, which contains reports of suspected adverse drug reactions from worldwide sources. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the association using population-based healthcare data. Methods: This was a case-control study among users of bisphosphonates and other drugs for osteoporosis in six healthcare databases covering over 30 million individuals in Italy, Netherlands and the UK from 1996 to 2012. Prescriptions/dispensations were used to assess drug exposure. Newly diagnosed cases of <b>cardiac</b> <b>valvulopathy</b> were identified via disease codes/free-text search. Controls were matched to each case by age, sex, database and index date. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression for the pooled data and meta-analysis of individual database risk estimates. Results: A small but statistically significant association was found between exposure to bisphosphonates as a class and risk of valvulopathy. Overall risk was 18  % higher (95  % CI 12 – 23  %) in those currently exposed to any bisphosphonate (mainly alendronate and risedronate) vs. those not exposed within the previous year. Risk of valve regurgitation was 14  % higher (95  % CI 7 – 22  %). Decreased valvulopathy risk was observed with longer cumulative duration of bisphosphonate use, compared to use of less than 6  months. Meta-analyses of database-specific estimates confirmed results from pooled analyses. Conclusions: The observed increased risks of <b>cardiac</b> <b>valvulopathy</b> with bisphosphonate use, although statistically significant, were quite small and unlikely to be clinically significant. Further studies are still needed to evaluate whether bisphosphonates increase or decrease the risk of valvulopathy and to investigate possible mechanisms for the association...|$|E

In this study, we aimed to document the severity of fetal cardiac dysfunction in Stage IV TTTS (fetal hydrops) and assess evolution of cardiac function longitudinally after fetoscopic laser surgery. Methods: We reviewed obstetric ultrasound examination data, pre- and postoperative echocardiograms and neonatal outcomes for 22 cases of Stage IV TTTS undergoing fetoscopic laser ablation of placental anastomoses between 1998 and 2011. Myocardial performance index, atrioventricular valve flow patterns, ventricular shortening fraction, ventricular hypertrophy, outflow tract obstruction and venous Doppler waveforms were assessed. Results Nineteen fetuses (86. 4 %) had ascites, eight (36. 4 %) had pleural effusions, nine (40. 9 %) had a pericardial effusion and 12 (54. 5 %) had subcutaneous edema at presentation. Preoperatively, cardiac function was grossly abnormal in all. Eight fetuses (36. 4 %) had functional pulmonary atresia and one (4. 5 %) had functional aortic atresia. Seventy-seven percent of recipient fetuses survived until birth. Postoperative echocardiographic follow-up (mean, 26 days) showed that indices of fetal cardiac function improved considerably, but never completely normalized. Six of the eight fetuses with functional pulmonary atresia (75. 0 %), {{as well as the}} fetus with functional aortic atresia, survived to birth. In all cases, the functional atresia resolved within 48 h of laser ablation therapy and none had structural valve anomalies at birth. All fetal effusions resolved after the laser.

We identified 6 loci, which we replicated in 1, 422 cases and 6, 779 controls, and provide functional evidence for candidate genes. We highlight LMCD 1 (LIM and cysteine-rich domains 1), which encodes a transcription factor and for which morpholino knockdown of the ortholog in zebrafish resulted in atrioventricular valve regurgitation.

Fibrosis that occurs either local to or distant from the primary tumor is one of the hallmarks of carcinoid tumors that originate from the midgut.

40|$|Pergolide, {{lisuride}} and terguride are {{drugs that}} possess a tetracyclic ergoline skeletal structure. The ergoline skeleton shows the structural {{features of the}} monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline. This suggests that ergoline derivatives may have affinity for the receptors of the three neurotransmitters. Due to the low receptor specificity and selectivity, ergoline derivatives show {{a wide array of}} action and are therefore considered as being “dirty drugs”. Using such compounds as drugs in men one should await unwanted side effects beside the therapeutic action. Pergolide and lisuride are used in the treatment of Parkinson`s disease. Causing <b>cardiac</b> <b>valvulopathy</b> is a severe side effect of pergolide that is associated with the involvement of 5 -HT 2 B and/or 5 -HT 2 A receptor activation. Performing functional organ bath studies with porcine pulmonary arteries (bioassay for 5 -HT 2 B receptors) and porcine coronary arteries (bioassay for 5 -HT 2 A receptors) the propyl substituent at N(6) of pergolide was identified as the molecular fragment that is responsible for the agonist effects of pergolide at 5 -HT 2 B and 5 -HT 2 A receptors. Thus the N(6) propyl group is a determinant of <b>cardiac</b> <b>valvulopathy</b> disclosing in cardiac-valve insufficiency and cardiac-valve regur­gitation. Ergoline derivatives partially display high affinity for α 2 -adrenoceptors (ARs) which are considered to be the target structures for drugs used in the treatment of Parkinson`s disease and Raynaud`s phenomenon. Due to the lack of convenient in vitro α 2 -AR assays {{that can be used for}} the pharmacological characterisation of (potential) drugs, a new vascular α 2 C-AR assay (viz. the porcine pulmonary vein) was established. For these purposes, the porcine pulmonary vein was investigated in organ bath studies recording the effects of relatively selective α-AR-antagonist on the contractions caused by UK 14304. The results from the Schild- and correlation analysis unambiguously showed that UK 14304 -induced contractions are mediated by a single α 2 -AR subtype. Detection (RT-PCR) and quantification (RTQ-PCR) of mRNA for the α 2 -ARs subtypes in the porcine pulmonary vein revealed the presence and the dominant expression of mRNA for the α 2 C-AR. The postsynaptic α 2 -AR in the porcine pulmonary vein is of the α 2 C-subtype. 5 -HT 2 B and 5 -HT 7 receptor antagonists are beneficial in the prophylactic treatment of migraine. Based on lisuride and terguride (parent compounds), both are antagonists at the two serotonin receptors, structural modified ergoline derivatives were tested using the porcine pulmonary artery (bioassay for 5 -HT 2 B and 5 -HT 7 receptors). Beside the aim to minimise the potential of side effects and to increase the receptor selectivity, structural changes of the parent compounds should also enhance or retain the affinity for both receptors.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Therapeutic {{options for}} Parkinson's disease mainly consist of L-dopa and {{dopamine}} agonists. However, in Japan, the product labeling of the ergot dopamine agonists, cabergoline and pergolide, was revised in April 2007 {{due to the}} risk of developing <b>cardiac</b> <b>valvulopathy.</b> Here, we describe the prescribing trends of anti-Parkinson drugs from 2005 through 2010 in Japan, and examined whether these trends changed after the drug safety measures in 2007. METHODS AND PATIENTS: We used medical claim data from January 2005 to December 2010 for Parkinson's disease patients older than 30 years who were prescribed anti-Parkinson drugs. We calculated the proportion of patients prescribed each drug for each year, and compared the proportions of first-line drugs prescribed before and after April 2007. We also examined the prescription variations of cabergoline/pergolide users one year before or after April 2007. RESULTS: L-dopa was the most frequently prescribed drug for Parkinson's disease (2005, 58 %; 2010, 51 %). The proportion of patients prescribed ergot dopamine agonists markedly decreased and non-ergot dopamine agonists increased after 2007. Among first-line drugs, the proportion of non-ergot agents increased after April 2007. Among 54 cabergoline/pergolide users, 24 (44 %) discontinued these drugs, nine of whom switched to non-ergot agents. CONCLUSION: L-dopa was the mainstay of Parkinson's disease treatment between 2005 and 2010 in Japan.

In case of positive response, a questionnaire assessing prescribing patterns and previous medical history was proposed and echocardiography was performed. All usual echocardiographic parameters were analysed. We applied criteria from the French multicenter registry for diagnosis of drug-induced valvulopathy. ResultsNinety patients exposed to the drugs were included. Sixty-seven percent were women (n= 60). Fifty-three percent had diabete (n= 47). Ninety percent were exposed to benfluorex (n= 81).

Although there are several established antimalarials in clinical use, there is an urgent need for new drugs due to rapid resistance development. In recent years, more than 20, 000 hits phenotypically active against P. falciparum, one of the major malaria causing agents, were disclosed from three independent HTS campaigns [1 - 3]. In order to make these hit libraries accessible to as many biological laboratories as possible, the MMV compiled and distributed the Open Access Malaria Box, a set of 400 chemically diverse active compounds [4]. One important task is now to elucidate the mode of action of those compounds. However, beside the parasite targets it is also necessary to identify potential host interactions in order to anticipate the risk of unde-sired side effects of those chemotypes at the earliest possi-ble stage of development. To this end, we applied a ligand-based virtual target pro-filing approach to predict possible interactions with human targets [5]. Amongst others, kinases and GPCRs were identified as the most important target classes. Sub-sequently, several hundred predicted interactions were selected for prospective experimental testing. Results showed that a substantial part of the Malaria Box exhibits the potential of interacting with human GPCRs.

Design: A cross-sectional echocardiographic study was performed in patients who were receiving cabergoline therapy for prolactinoma. Results: Hundred (61 females, 39 males) prolactinoma cases (81 macroprolactinoma and 19 microprolactinoma) were included in the study. The mean age at presentation was 33. 9 ± 9. 0 years (range: 16 – 58 years). The mean duration of treatment was 53. 11 ± 43. 15 months (range: 12 – 155 months). The mean cumulative dose was 308. 6 ± 290. 2 mg (range: 26 – 1196 mg; interquartile range: 104 – 416 mg). Mild mitral regurgitation was present in one patient (cumulative cabergoline dose 104 mg). Mild tricuspid regurgitation was present in another two patients (cumulative cabergoline dose 52 mg and 104 mg). Aortic and pulmonary valve functioning was normal in all the cases. There were no cases of significant valvular regurgitation (moderate to severe, Grade 3 – 4). None of the patients had morphological abnormalities such as thickening, calcification, and restricted mobility of any of the cardiac valves. Conclusion: Cabergoline appears to be safe in patients with prolactinoma up to the cumulative dose of ~ 300 mg. The screening for valvulopathy should be restricted to those with higher cumulative cabergoline exposure...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1990 's {{cabergoline}} {{has been}} the treatment of choice in prolactinoma, as it permits rapid and effective hormonal and tumor control in most cases. Evidence of <b>cardiac</b> <b>valvulopathy</b> was demonstrated in Parkinson's disease patients treated with dopamine agonists. Retrospective studies in prolactinoma patients treated with cabergoline at lower doses did not show such an effect. However, few prospective data with long-term follow-up are available. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the safety of cabergoline regarding cardiac valvular status during prospective follow-up in patients treated for prolactinoma or idiopathic hyperprolactinemia. We report here a series of 100 patients (71 F; median age at diagnosis: 41. 5 years) treated with cabergoline for endocrine diseases (prolactinoma n = 89, idiopathic hyperprolactinemia n = 11). All patients underwent complete transthoracic echocardiographic studies at baseline and during long-term prospective surveillance using the same equipment and performed by the same technicians. The median interval between baseline and last follow-up echocardiographic studies while on cabergoline was 62. 5 months (interquartile range: 34. 75 - 77. 0). The median total duration of cabergoline treatment was 124. 5 months (interquartile range: 80. 75 - 188. 75) and the median cumulative total dose of cabergoline was 277. 8 mg (interquartile range : 121. 4 - 437. 8 mg) at last follow-up. We found no clinically relevant alterations in cardiac valve function or valvular calcifications with cabergoline treatment. Our data suggest that findings from retrospective analyses are correct and that cabergoline is a safe chronic treatment at the doses used typically in endocrinology. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Restless legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) is {{a condition}} characterized by discomfort at rest and urge to move focused on the legs. RLS may occur as an idiopathic, often hereditary condition (primary RLS), or in association with medical conditions (secondary RLS) including iron deficiency, uremia, and polyneuropathy. Current understanding of the pathophysiology of RLS points to the involvement of three interrelated components: dopaminergic dysfunction, impaired iron homeostasis, and genetic mechanisms. The diagnosis of RLS is made according to the consensus criteria by a National Institutes of Health panel: 1) an urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by uncomfortable sensations; 2) beginning or worsening during rest; 3) relieved by movement; and 4) worse, or only occurring, in the evening or at night. The differential diagnosis of RLS aims to: 1) distinguish RLS from other disorders with RLS-like symptoms and 2) identify secondary forms, with investigation of underlying diseases. The treatment of RLS demands a clinical evaluation to rule out and cure causes of secondary RLS, including iron supplementation when deficient, and to eliminate the triggering factors. The presence of neuropathy should be especially investigated in nonhereditary, late-onset RLS, in view of a possible treatment of the underlying disease. The first line treatment for idiopathic RLS is represented by dopamine agonists, in particular nonergot-derived ropinirole and pramipexole, whereas ergot dopamine agonists (cabergoline and pergolide) {{are no longer in}} first-line use given the risks of <b>cardiac</b> <b>valvulopathy.</b> Although no comparative trials have been published, a meta-analysis of pramipexole versus ropinirole suggests differences in efficacy and tolerability favoring pramipexole...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionAntiphospholipid {{syndrome}} (APLS) {{is defined}} by the occur-rence thrombosis, and/or obstetric morbidity associated with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Cardiovascular manifestations of APLS are variable and some of them can be life threatening. Patients and MethodsRetrospective study of patients with APLS (diagnosed according to Sidney classification criteria of 2006) in an Internal medicine department over a period of 14 years. ResultsThirty-four patients with APLS had cardiovascular involvements (66. 6 %); 30 females and 4 males, {{with a mean age of}} 40. 5 years (24 - 74 years). Cardiovascular involvements revealed the disease in 53 % of cases. Venous thromboses were most frequent manifestation: deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) (12 cases), pulmonary embolism (5 cases), cerebral venous thrombosis (1 case), inferior vena cava thrombosis (1 case), portal vein thrombosis (1 case), superficial venous thrombosis (1 case) and central retinal vein occlusion (2 cases). Arterial thromboses were noted in 12 patients: stroke (9 cases), upper limb artery, renal artery and occlusion of central retinal artery (each in 1 patient). Acute coronary artery thrombosis was observed in one patient (myocardial infarction). Pericarditis was noted in 3 cases, valvular disease in 2 cases (an aortic and a mitral stenosis), and myocarditis in 1 patient. Anticardiolipin and anti-B 2 glycoprotein I antibodies were positive in 47. 1 % and 52. 8 % of cases respectively. Anticoagulant therapy was prescribed in thrombotic cases. Pericarditis were treated with corticosteroids and patient with myoarditis had both corticosteroid and immunosuppressant agent.

40|$|CONTEXT Uncertainty exists {{whether the}} {{long-term}} use of ergot-derived dopamine agonist (DA) drugs {{for the treatment}} of hyperprolactinemia may be associated with clinically significant valvular heart disease; and whether current regulatory authority guidelines for echocardiographic screening are clinically appropriate. OBJECTIVE: To provide follow-up echocardiographic data on a previously described cohort of patients treated with DA for lactotrope pituitary tumors; and to explore possible associations between structural and functional valve abnormalities with the cumulative dose of drug used. DESIGN: Follow-up echocardiographic data were collected from a proportion of our previously reported cohort of patients; all had received continuous DA therapy for at least 2 years in the intervening period. Studies were performed according to British Society of Echocardiography minimum standards for adult transthoracic echocardiography. Generalised estimating equations with backward selection were used to determine odds ratios of valvular heart abnormalities according to tertiles of cumulative cabergoline dose, using the lowest tertile as the reference group. SETTING: Thirteen centers of secondary/tertiary endocrine care across the United Kingdom. RESULTS: There were 192 patients (81 males; median age, 51 years; interquartile range [IQR], 42 – 62). Median (IQR) cumulative cabergoline doses at the first and second echocardiograms were 97 mg (20 – 377) and 232 mg (91 – 551) respectively. Median (IQR) duration of uninterrupted cabergoline therapy between echocardiograms was 34 months (24 – 42). No associations were observed between cumulative doses of dopamine agonist used and the age-corrected prevalence of any valvular abnormality. CONCLUSION: This large UK follow-up study does not support a clinically significant association between the use of DA {{for the treatment of}} hyperprolactinemia and <b>cardiac</b> <b>valvulopathy</b> - See more at: [URL]...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: In 2007, a large goat-farming-associated Q fever {{outbreak}} {{occurred in}} the Netherlands. Data on the clinical outcome of Dutch Q fever patients are lacking. The current advocated follow-up strategy includes serological follow-up to detect evolution to chronic disease and cardiac screening at baseline to identify and prophylactically treat Q fever patients in case of valvulopathy. However, serological follow-up using commercially available tests {{is complicated by the}} lack of validated cut-off values. Furthermore, cardiac screening in the setting of a large outbreak has not been implemented previously. Therefore, we report here the clinical outcome, serological follow-up and cardiac screening data of the Q fever patients of the current ongoing outbreak. METHODS: The implementation of a protocol including clinical and serological follow-up at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months after acute Q fever and screening echocardiography at baseline. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients with acute Q fever were identified (male 62 %, female 38 %). An aspecific, flu-like illness was the most common clinical presentation. Persistent symptoms after acute Q fever were reported by 59 % of patients at 6 months and 30 % at 12 months follow-up. We observed a typical serological response to Coxiella burnetii infection in both anti-phase I and anti-phase II IgG antibodies, with an increase in antibody titres up to 3 months and a subsequent decrease in the following 9 months. Screening echocardiography was available for 66 (78 %) out of 85 Q fever patients. <b>Cardiac</b> <b>valvulopathy</b> was present in 39 (59 %) patients. None of the 85 patients developed chronic Q fever. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical, serological and echocardiographic data of the current ongoing Dutch Q fever outbreak cohort are presented.

40|$|Serotonin (5 -HT) –related {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} ex-plored extensively for pharmaceutical development,especially {{with regard to}} antidepressants and appetite suppressants. However, pharmacological agents acting through 5 -HT–related pathways {{have been associated with}} a number of significant cardiovascular adverse effects, includ-ing pulmonary hypertension, 1, 2 cardiac arrhythmias, 2 and cardiac valve abnormalities. 1 – 4 Evidence for a 5 -HT valvu-lopathy has arisen from a variety of observations, including clinical, 3, 4 animal model, 5 and cell culture investigations. 6, 7 Patients with carcinoid syndrome tumors, 4 others treated with the diet drug combination fenfluramine-phentermine (Fen/ Phen), 3 and individuals treated with ergot derivatives 8 have been observed to develop what is most likely a 5 -HT valvulopathy with comparable heart valve pathology between these different clinical groupings. In patients with carcinoid syndrome tumors, high 5 -HT levels were observed to be associated with fibrodysplasia affecting predominantly the right-side cardiac valves 3; a comparable pattern of valve disease was observed in a number of reported patients treated with ergot derivatives. 8 The reason for this right-side valvu-lopathy distribution (tricuspid and pulmonary valves) has been hypothetically attributed to pulmonary monoamine ox-idase clearance of 5 -HT, thereby resulting in left-side cardiac valves being exposed to relatively lower 5 -HT levels 1, 4 despite elevated systemic 5 -HT. However, a recent animal study involving daily injection of 5 -HT in rats demonstrated both elevated 5 -HT levels and right- and left-side valve abnormalities. 5 Article p 81 The Fen/Phen valvulopathy has been reported to affect both right- and left-side cardiac valves, 3 and this was hypoth-esized to be due in part to pulmonary monoamine oxidase inhibition by Phen, resulting in increased 5 -HT exposure for left-side cardiac valves. 1 However, the mechanisms respon-sible for the pathogenesis of the cardiac effects of 5 -HT are likely linked to interactions involving both 5 -HT receptors and the 5 -HT transmembrane transporter (5 -HTT).

40|$|From 2007 - 2010, {{during the}} recent Q fever {{epidemic}} in the Netherlands, over 4000 cases of acute Q fever were registered, which is an underestimation of {{the total amount of}} Coxiella burnetii infections due to a high amount of asymptomatic primary infections. In the literature it is stated that 1 - 5 % of patients develop chronic Q fever after acute Q fever. We demonstrated that the risk for development of chronic Q fever after a known acute Q fever episode is approximately 2. 5 % for all chronic Q fever cases, and 1. 5 % if limited to proven and probable chronic Q fever cases. We have also demonstrated that the majority of patients with chronic Q fever did not recall an acute Q fever episode. From the Dutch National Chronic Q Fever Database we identified 284 chronic Q fever patients of whom 151 (53. 7 %) had proven, 64 (22. 5 %) probable and 69 (24. 3 %) possible chronic Q fever. The majority of proven and probable chronic Q fever patients had a vascular focus of infection (56. 7 %), while endocarditis (34. 9 %) was less prevalent. We described that most patients who died of chronic Q fever-related complications, had a vascular focus of infection (79 %). Previously proposed risk factors for the development of chronic Q fever consist of pre-existing <b>cardiac</b> <b>valvulopathy,</b> vascular grafts and aneurysms, immunosuppression and pregnancy. Identified risk factors for chronic Q fever in this thesis were previous cardiac valvular surgery, vascular prosthesis, aneurysms, renal insufficiency, and increasing age. An association between immunosuppression and pregnancy, and chronic Q fever could not be confirmed in this study. A novel finding was the association between mild renal insufficiency and chronic Q fever. Increasing age also predisposed for the development of chronic Q fever. The diagnostic criteria of chronic Q fever have recently led to debate in the international literature. A positive C. burnetii PCR, in the absence of signs of acute Q fever, proves chronic Q fever, but this method has low sensitivity in blood. Until now, diagnosis of chronic Q fever relied mainly on serological examination. In this thesis, we have demonstrated that high phase I IgG titres have a high positive predictive value (PPV) to differentiate proven chronic Q fever from possible chronic Q fever, especially if titres exceed 1 : 4096. Nevertheless, sensitivity of high phase I IgG titres is low: 60 % in case of phase I IgG titres > 1 : 4096. In contrast, phase I IgG titres between 1 : 1024 and 1 : 4096 have high sensitivity (98 - 81 %), but a low PPV (62 - 77 %). These results emphasizes that serology is not a diagnostic tool on its own, but should be interpreted in relation with the clinical background. The diagnostic guideline of the Dutch Q fever Consensus Group combines PCR, serology, clinical data and radiological data. In this guideline, suspected chronic Q fever cases are divided in three groups in decreasing likelihood of chronic Q fever: proven, probable and possible. We have demonstrated that the guideline of the Dutch Q fever Consensus Group has better sensitivity and also takes more rare manifestations of chronic Q fever into accoun...|$|E
