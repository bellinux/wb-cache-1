5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the {{pericardium}} which surrounds the heart, which when inflamed is called pericarditis. This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, tuberculosis or Q fever), systemic disorders such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects {{the ability of the}} heart to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the pericardium this is called pericardial effusion, which when it causes acute heart failure is called <b>cardiac</b> <b>tamponade.</b> This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an effusion. This can compress the heart and adversely affect the function of the heart. The fluid can be removed from the pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{assessed}} {{the feasibility of}} implanting a device in the left atrial appendage (LAA) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) to prevent thromboembolic stroke. BackgroundMeta-analyses confirmed that in cases of left atrial thrombus in nonrheumatic AF patients approximately 90 % {{of them are in}} the LAA. MethodsThe WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage System (Atritech Inc., Plymouth, Minnesota) is a nitinol device implanted percutaneously to seal the LAA. Patients were followed by clinical and transesophageal echocardiography at 45 days and 6 months with annual clinical follow-up thereafter. ResultsSixty-six patients underwent device implantation. Mean follow-up was 740 ± 341 days. At 45 days, 93 % (54 of 58) devices showed successful sealing of LAA according to protocol. Two patients experienced device embolization, both successfully retrieved percutaneously. No embolizations occurred in 53 patients enrolled after modification of fixation barbs. There were 2 <b>cardiac</b> <b>tamponades,</b> 1 air embolism, and 1 delivery wire fracture (first generation) with surgical explantation but no long-term sequelae for the patient. Four patients developed a flat thrombus layer on the device at 6 months that resolved with additional anticoagulation. Two patients experienced transient ischemic attack, 1 without visible thrombus. There were 2 deaths, neither device related. Autopsy documented a stable, fully endothelialized device 9 months after implantation. No strokes occurred during follow-up despite > 90 % of patients with discontinuation of anticoagulation. ConclusionsPreliminary data suggest LAA occlusion with the WATCHMAN System to be safe and feasible. A randomized study is ongoing comparing oral anticoagulation with percutaneous closure...|$|R

BackgroundOver 90 % of intracardiac thrombi in atrial fibrillation originate from the left atrial appendage (LAA). Patients with contraindications to anticoagulation are potential candidates for LAA percutaneous occlusion. TEE is typically used to guide implantation. MethodsICE-guided percutaneous LAA closure was performed in 121 patients to evaluate the following tasks typically achieved by TEE: assessment of the LAA dimension for device sizing; guidance of transseptal puncture; verification of the delivery sheath position; confirmation of location and stability of the device before and after release and continuous monitoring to detect procedural complications. In 51 consecutive patients, we compared the measurements obtained by ICE and fluoroscopy to choose the size of the device. ResultsThe device was successfully implanted in 117 patients, yielding a technical success rate of 96. 7 %. Procedural success was achieved in 113 cases (93. 4 %). Four major adverse events (3 <b>cardiac</b> <b>tamponades</b> and 1 in-hospital transient ischemic attack) occurred. There was significant correlation in the measurements for device sizing assessed by angiography and ICE (r = 0. 94, p < 0. 0001). ConclusionsICE imaging was able to perform the tasks typically provided by TEE during implantation of the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug device for LAA occlusion. Therefore, we provide evidence that the use of ICE offered accurate measurements of LAA dimension in order to select the correct device sizes...|$|R

Interstitial lung disease presents with gradual onset of shortness of breath typically with a history of a predisposing environmental exposure. Shortness of breath is often the only symptom in those with tachydysrhythmias. Panic attacks typically present with hyperventilation, sweating, and numbness. They are however a diagnosis of exclusion. Around 2/3 of women experience shortness of breath {{as a part of a}} normal pregnancy. Neurological conditions such as spinal cord injury, phrenic nerve injuries, Guillain–Barré syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy can all cause an individual to experience shortness of breath.

40|$|Background: Transcatheter aortic-valve {{implantation}} (TAVI) {{is a new}} therapeutic {{choice for}} treating aortic stenosis in patients considered high risk for surgery. This blooming therapeutic technique still requires evaluation of medium and long term outcome. Method: We hereby report our results of the first 150 consecutive patients to receive TAVI implants in our population recruited from July 2009 to March 2013 in a retrospective and monocentric study. We analyzed long term morbidity and mortality criteria. We compared the apical and femoral approach results and researched predictors of cardiac mortality. Results: The mean monitoring period was 387. 62 days, mean Euroscore was 21. 8, and mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk score was 9. 2. The success rate for the procedure was 94. 6 %. A total of 39 patients died. The mortality rates at the immediate perioperative point, 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years, were 4 %, 11. 3 %, 22. 7 %, and 26 %, respectively. As regards complications, there were 10 hemodynamic complications (6. 6 %) and 20 vascular (13. 3 %), 11 <b>cardiac</b> <b>tamponades</b> (7. 4 %), eight mechanical (5. 3 %), ten major hemorrhagic (6. 7 %), 14 pulmonary (9. 3 %), and 18 infectious complications (12 %). When comparing the rates of reported complications in terms of different approaches, we observed significantly more hemodynamic complications in the apical group (p = 0. 049). Pulmonary complications were also significantly more common in cases of apical approach (p = 0. 029). The majority of the patients reported clear functional improvement throughout their follow-up. Conclusion: The results of the first 150 patients to receive the implant at the Nancy University Teaching Hospital (CHU Nancy) were consistent with findings in the literature. TAVI proved a credible and effective alternative to surgical valve replacement for patients at high risk during surgery...|$|R

40|$|Radiofrequency {{ablation}} (RFA) {{has emerged}} as an important curative therapy for treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. However, significant deficiencies exist in achieving successful RFA outcomes while ensuring patients safety. Therefore, in this thesis we constructed an in vitro novel thermochromic phantom model to accurately assess RFA lesion size with higher spatial and temporal {{in order to achieve}} the optimal balance of delivering RF energy without causing overheating. Additionally, we ablated using an in vivo novel direct endocardial visualisation ablation catheter that preserves a clear field of view during delivery of RF energy at the desired target site. We developed a novel and practical electrogram-gated delivery of RFA such that it negated the effects cardiac contractions and respiratory motion related sliding catheter motion for creation of predictably consistent lesion depth irrespective of the degree of catheter motion occurring. Finally, we developed an in vitro novel acoustic hydrophone to detect impending steam pop during RFA such that it can be prevented in time to avoid potentially devastating clinical complications of <b>cardiac</b> perforation, <b>tamponade</b> and death. Ultimately, our goal was to enhance the proceduralist’s ability to achieve a desired balance between creating transmural lesion and preventing tissue overheating with steam pop and/or thrombus formation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) {{remains the}} gold {{standard}} for the diagnosis of graft rejection after heart transplantation (HT). Our purpose was to evaluate the rate of complications of this invasive procedure. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 175 patients, who were transplanted between November 2003 and October 2010 and survived more than 1 month after surgery. We evaluated the number of inconclusive EMB and described the incidence, nature, and subsequent management of several complications associated with this procedure. RESULTS: Over a period of approximately 7 years, we performed 2217 EMB yielding 4972 specimens, namely, an average of 2. 3 fragments per procedure. The majority of EMBs (95. 3 %) were performed by the femoral approach. Only 12 EMB (0. 57 %) were inconclusive. The overall complication rate was 0. 71 %. During puncture, one patient experienced a vasovagal reaction and another one, a femoral artery false aneurysm. During the biopsy, there was one case of <b>cardiac</b> perforation with <b>tamponade,</b> two cases of supraventricular tachycardia, and three atrioventricular conduction abnormalities.

40|$|Background There {{have been}} no single-center studies that have {{systematically}} addressed the acute outcome of Inoue balloon mitral commissurotomy (BMC) performed in a large series of patients. Accordingly, this study sought to {{examine the impact of}} operator experience and continuing technical modifications on the success and complication rates of BMC. Methods BMC was performed in 799 patients: 469 patients with pliable mitral valves (group 1) and 330 patients with calcified valves and/or severe subvalvular disease (group 2). Acute complications were examined and compared between groups before and after modifications in BMC techniques. Major modifications included the use of a height-derived balloon sizing method for the selection of an appropriate balloon catheter, a cautionary stepwise dilation technique, and avoidance of traction on the interatrial septum during balloon inflations. Results Technical failures were encountered in 4 (0. 5 %) patients in our early experience. One patient sustained <b>cardiac</b> perforation and <b>tamponade</b> and was the only case requiring emergency surgery. There were no deaths. Systemic embolic events were observed in 11 (1. 4 %), all among the first 353 patients before the routine use of pre-BMC transesophageal echocardiography. Severe postprocedure angiographic (≥ 3 +) mitral regurgitation occurred in 4 % of patients, 2 % in group 1 versus 9 % in group 2 (P =. 0001). With increased operator experience and technical modifications, this complication was significantly reduced from 5 % (7 of 150 patients) to 0 % in the last 316 patients in group 1 (P =. 0001) and from 11 % (26 of 228 patients) to 3 % (3 of 101 patients) in group 2 (P =. 031).

40|$|IntroductionLimited data {{exist on}} the {{efficacy}} and safety of remote magnetic navigation (RMN) ablation of iatrogenic left atrial flutter (LAF) occurring after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. MethodsLAF ablation procedures (proc) were reviewed. Patients (pts) were divided into 2 groups (gr) : RMN gr if proc were performed remotely using the Niobe system (Sterotaxis) and conventional gr (CON) if proc were performed with manually driven catheters. Open-irrigated 3. 5 mm-tip catheters were used in all pts. Activation LA maps were realized in all pts using Carto or EnSite). Acute (defined as sinus rhythm- SR- resumption during ablation) and long-term (defined as SR maintenance) proc success, proc duration, fluoroscopy and radiofrequency (RF) times, and the mechanism of arrhythmias were studied. ResultsIn 46 pts (38 males, 60. 8 ± 10. 19 y) 57 LAF ablation proc were performed. Age and LA size were similar. Activation maps showed: a unique macro-reentrant circuit 46 %, multiples successive macro-reentrant circuits 26 %, focal pulmonary vein tachycardia 9 %, micro-reentrant circuit 19 %. Results are showed in the table. Complications occurred in 3 proc: 1 in the RMN gr (groin hematoma) and 2 in the CON gr (1 transient ischemic attack and 1 <b>cardiac</b> perforation with <b>tamponade).</b> Perimitral flutter that occurred at any stage of the proc was associated with significantly higher rate of acute failure (persistent perimitral flutter {{at the end of}} the proc, both gr) : 44 % vs 12 % for other types of flutter, p= 0. 02.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveExtrapleural {{pneumonectomy}} for therapy of mesothelioma {{has been}} associated with significant perioperative mortality and morbidity. Postoperative complications of this procedure require a unique management approach. We developed treatment algorithms for most of the common complications of extrapleural pneumonectomy resulting in reduced mortality and hospital stay. Complications after extrapleural pneumonectomy were further analyzed to elucidate means of prevention, early detection, and treatment. MethodsA total of 496 patients undergoing extrapleural pneumonectomy were reviewed for mortality rates, with a subset of 328 consecutive patients between 1980 and 2000 who were examined for detailed morbidity data by using a prospective clinical database. ResultsMedian age was 58 years (range, 28 - 77 years), with a 10 -day (range, 4 - 101 days) median length of stay. One hundred ninety-eight (60. 4 %) of 328 patients experienced minor and major complications, and 11 of 328 patients died, for an overall mortality rate of 3. 4 %. Complications included the following: atrial fibrillation (145 [44. 2 %]), prolonged intubation (26 [7. 9 %]), vocal cord paralysis (22 [6. 7 %]), deep vein thrombosis (21 [6. 4 %]), technical complications (patch dehiscence, hemorrhage, or both; 20 [6. 1 %]), tamponade (12 [3. 6 %]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [3. 6 %]), cardiac arrest (10 [3 %]), constrictive physiology (9 [2. 7 %]), aspiration (9 [2. 7 %]), renal failure (9 [2. 7 %]), empyema (8 [2. 4 %]), tracheostomy (6 [1. 8 %]), myocardial infarction (5 [1. 5 %]), pulmonary embolus (5 [1. 5 %]), and bronchopleural fistula (2 [0. 6 %]). Clinical data demonstrated the following: (1) prophylaxis for atrial fibrillation is recommended; (2) early ambulation, aspiration precautions, endoscopic assessment of the vocal cords, and avoidance of fluid overload are crucial; (3) perioperative diagnosis and aggressive management of deep vein thrombosis are important; (4) immediate reoperation and open cardiac massage are essential for relief of <b>cardiac</b> herniation and <b>tamponade</b> from <b>cardiac</b> patch dysfunction; (5) diaphragmatic patch dehiscence, hemorrhage, or both require immediate reoperation; (6) early signs of infection might indicate bronchopleural fistula or empyema and should be treated with thoracoscopic or open drainage and staged removal of patch material; and (7) excessive perioperative mediastinal shift is treated with a catheter placed intraoperatively. ConclusionComplications after extrapleural pneumonectomy require a unique approach to management, and mortality can be minimized by early detection and aggressive treatment...|$|R
