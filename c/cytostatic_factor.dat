5000|$|In {{the same}} year, Sha et al. {{independently}} {{reached the same}} conclusion revealing the hysteretic loop also using Xenopus laevis egg extracts. In this article, three predictions of the Novak-Tyson model were tested {{in an effort to}} conclude that hysteresis is the driving force for [...] "cell-cycle transitions into and out of mitosis". The predictions of the Novak-Tyson model are generic to all saddle-node bifurcations. Saddle-node bifurcations are extremely useful bifurcations in an imperfect world because they help describe biological systems which are not perfect. The first prediction was that the threshold concentration of cyclin to enter mitosis is higher than the threshold concentration of cyclin to exit mitosis, and this was confirmed by supplementing cycling egg extracts with non-degradable cyclin B and measuring the activation and inactivation threshold after the addition of cycloheximide (CHX), which is a protein synthesis inhibitor. Furthermore, the second prediction of the Novak-Tyson model was also validated: unreplicated deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, increases the threshold concentration of cyclin that is required to enter mitosis. In order to arrive at this conclusion, <b>cytostatic</b> <b>factor</b> released extracts were supplemented with CHX, APH (a DNA polymerase inhibitor), or both, and non-degradable cyclin B was added. The third and last prediction that was tested and proven true in this article was that the rate of Cdc2 activation slows down near the activation threshold concentration of cyclin. These predictions and experiments demonstrate the toggle-like switching behavior that can be described by hysteresis in a dynamical system.|$|E

An early manifestation of a regulatory role for this transition metal is the significant increase in total intracellular zinc. This accumulation is essential for meiotic progression beyond telophase I and the establishment of meiotic arrest at metaphase II. The subsequent developmental event, fertilization, induces a rapid expulsion of labile zinc that is a hallmark event in meiotic resumption.

In clinical trials, agents including small molecule inhibitors and antibody-based pharmaceuticals can be given concurrently or continually with conventional therapy (Hallek et al., 2014). One caveat is, the results of some trials may not be exciting, as the cytostatic effects of molecule-targeted agents might render tumor cells insensitive to cycle-active chemotherapy. Thus, it is worthwhile to conceive advanced clinical trials, in which adjuvant chemotherapy (cytotoxic) agents are administered but with enhanced specificity to proliferating cells, while novel drugs (<b>cytostatic)</b> targeting DDSP <b>factors</b> are used during therapy courses to shield influence from surrounding stroma. Thus, an ideal approach is to apply these types of treatments sequentially as a metronomic design (Sun and Nelson, 2012).

The production of NO was examined in the sera of seven children infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) and in the sera of 14 children who became seronegative for HIV- 1 during the first year of life. In addition, we determined serum levels of various cytokines, such as interleukin (IL) - 1 P, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -a, and gamma interferon (IFN-y), inasmuch as these cytokines are potent inducers of NO production. Production of NO, detected as circulating serum levels of nitrite, was measured with use of the Griess reagent. Serum levels of cytokines were determined by enzyme immunoassay. Increased serum levels of nitrite were observed in children with HIV- 1 infection (0. 4 ± 0. 2 p,moVL; P =. 013), and in those who became seronegative for HIV- 1 during the first year of life (0. 5 ± 0. 3 p,moVL; P =. 04).

Yet, it also acts as a <b>cytostatic</b> and growth-relenting <b>factor</b> in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells. The underlying molecular mechanisms of the growth inhibitory property of LMP 1 have remained largely unknown. In this study, we show that LMP 1 negatively regulates a major oncogene, TCL 1, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and BL cells. MicroRNA (miR) profiling of LMP 1 transfectants showed that among others, miR- 29 b, is upregulated. LMP 1 diminished TCL 1 by inducing miR- 29 b through C-terminus activation region 1 (CTAR 1) and CTAR 2. miR- 29 b locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotide transfection into LMP 1 -expressing cells reduced miR- 29 b expression and consequently reconstituted TCL 1, suggesting that LMP 1 negatively regulates TCL 1 through miR- 29 b upregulation. The miR- 29 b increase by LMP 1 was due {{to an increase in}} the cluster pri-miR- 29 b 1 -a transcription, derived from human chromosome 7. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we found that p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-activating function of LMP 1 is important for this effect. The ability of LMP 1 to negatively regulate TCL 1 through miR- 29 b might underlie its B-cell lymphoma growth antagonistic property. As LMP 1 is also important for B-cell transformation, we suggest that the functional dichotomy of this viral protein may depend on a combination of levels of its expression, lineage and differentiation of the target cells and regulation of miRs, which then directs the outcome of the cellular response.

Unlike xEmi 2, separable N- and C-terminal domains of mouse Emi 2 modulated metaphase establishment and maintenance, respectively, through indirect and direct mechanisms. The C-terminal activity was mapped to the potential phosphorylation target Tx 5 SxS, a destruction box (D-box), a lattice of Zn 2 +-coordinating residues and an RL domain. The minimal region of Emi 2 required for its cytostatic activity was mapped to a region containing these motifs, from residue 491 to the C terminus.

When eggs treated with the microtubule inhibitor colcemid are fertilized or exposed to the calcium ionophore A 23187, normal calcium increases occur, but the eggs remain at metaphase. However, when colcemid-treated eggs are fertilized or A 23187 -treated and then exposed to the protein kinase inhibitor 6 -dimethylaminopurine (6 -DMAP), they enter interphase. Although colcemid-treated eggs require a calcium signal and exposure to 6 -DMAP, colcemid-treated embryonic cells are released from metaphase by treatment with 6 -DMAP, but not by exposure to A 23187. These results suggest that two distinct mechanisms maintain metaphase: one is the calcium-sensitive mechanism involving <b>cytostatic</b> <b>factor,</b> which normally maintains metaphase II arrest in eggs; the other mechanism, which may require the activity of 6 -DMAP-sensitive kinases, maintains metaphase {{in the absence of}} spindle assembly in both mitotic cells and eggs...|$|E
40|$|Degradation of {{specific}} protein substrates by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC) {{is critical for}} mitotic exit. We have identified the protein Xenopus nuclear factor 7 (Xnf 7) as a novel APC inhibitor able to regulate the timing of exit from mitosis. Immunodepletion of Xnf 7 from Xenopus laevis egg extracts accelerated the degradation of APC substrates cyclin B 1, cyclin B 2, and securin upon release from <b>cytostatic</b> <b>factor</b> arrest, whereas excess Xnf 7 inhibited APC activity. Interestingly, Xnf 7 exhibited intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity, and this activity was required for APC inhibition. Unlike other reported APC inhibitors, Xnf 7 did not associate with Cdc 20, but rather bound directly to core subunits of the APC. Furthermore, Xnf 7 was required for spindle assembly checkpoint function in egg extracts. These data suggest that Xnf 7 is an APC inhibitor able to link spindle status to the APC through direct association with APC core components...|$|E
40|$|Fertilization is the {{fundamental}} process in which two gametes - sperm and oocyte - fuse to generate a zygote that will form a new multicellular organism. In most vertebrates, oocytes await fertilization while arrested at metaphase of meiosis II. This resting state can be stable for many hours and depends on a cytoplasmic activity termed <b>cytostatic</b> <b>factor</b> (CSF). Recently, members of the novel Emi/Erp family of proteins have been put forward as important components of CSF. These proteins inhibit the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which acts at {{the very core of}} the cell cycle regulatory machinery. Initially, Xenopus early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi 1) was proposed to be a component of CSF, but newer work suggests that a structural relative, Emi-related protein 1 (Erp 1 /Emi 2), is essential for maintenance of CSF arrest in Xenopus. Most importantly, studies on Erp 1 /Emi 2 regulation have led to a detailed molecular understanding of the Ca 2 +-mediated release from CSF arrest that occurs upon fertilization...|$|E
40|$|In Xenopus oocytes, {{the spindle}} {{assembly}} checkpoint (SAC) kinase Bub 1 {{is required for}} <b>cytostatic</b> <b>factor</b> (CSF) -induced metaphase arrest in meiosis II. To investigate whether matured mouse oocytes are kept in metaphase by a SAC-mediated inhibition of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) complex, we injected a dominant-negative Bub 1 mutant (Bub 1 dn) into mouse oocytes undergoing meiosis in vitro. Passage through meiosis I was accelerated, but even though the SAC was disrupted, injected oocytes still arrested at metaphase II. Bub 1 dn-injected oocytes released from CSF and treated with nocodazole to disrupt the second meiotic spindle proceeded into interphase, whereas noninjected control oocytes remained arrested at metaphase. Similar results were obtained using dominant-negative forms of Mad 2 and BubR 1, as well as checkpoint resistant dominant APC/C activating forms of Cdc 20. Thus, SAC proteins are required for checkpoint functions in meiosis I and II, but, in contrast to frog eggs, the SAC is not required for establishing or maintaining the CSF arrest in mouse oocytes...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cytostatic</b> <b>factor</b> (CSF) arrests unfertilized {{vertebrate}} eggs in metaphase of meiosis II by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) from mediating cyclin destruction. The APC/C inhibitor Emi 2 /XErp 1 satisfies {{a number}} of historical criteria for the molecular identification of CSF, but the mechanism by which CSF is activated selectively in meiosis II is the remaining unexplained criterion. Here we provide an explanation by showing that Emi 2 is expressed specifically in meiosis II through translational de-repression or 2 ̆ 2 unmasking 2 ̆ 2 of its mRNA. We find that Emi 2 protein is undetectable in immature, G 2 /prophase-arrested Xenopus oocytes and accumulates approximately 90 minutes after germinal vesicle breakdown. The 32 ̆ 7 untranslated region of Emi 2 mRNA contains cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements that directly bind the CPEB protein and confer temporal regulation of Emi 2 polyadenylation and translation. Our results demonstrate that cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translational unmasking of Emi 2 directs meiosis II-specific CSF arrest...|$|E
40|$|Unfertilized {{vertebrate}} {{eggs are}} arrested in metaphase of meiosis II with high cyclin B/Cdc 2 activity to prevent parthenogenesis. Until fertilization, exit from metaphase is blocked by an activity called <b>cytostatic</b> <b>factor</b> (CSF), which stabilizes cyclin B by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) ubiquitin ligase. The APC inhibitor early mitotic inhibitor 1 (Emi 1) was recently {{found to be}} required for maintenance of CSF arrest. We show here that exogenous Emi 1 is unstable in CSF-arrested Xenopus eggs and is destroyed by the SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase, suggesting that endogenous Emi 1, an apparent 44 -kDa protein, requires a stabilizing factor. However, anti-Emi 1 antibodies crossreact with native Emi 2 /Erp 1 /FBXO 43, a homolog of Emi 1 and conserved APC inhibitor. Emi 2 is stable in CSF-arrested eggs, is sufficient to prevent CSF release, and is rapidly degraded in a Polo-like kinase 1 -dependent manner in response to calcium-mediated egg activation. These results identify Emi 2 as a candidate CSF maintenance protein...|$|E
