5|$|Honey {{bees are}} used commercially to produce honey. They also produce some {{substances}} used as dietary supplements with possible health benefits, pollen, propolis, and royal jelly, though {{all of these}} <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> allergic reactions.|$|E
5|$|If bulb {{extracts}} {{come into}} contact with wounds, both central nervous system and cardiac symptoms may result. The scent <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> toxic reactions such as headaches and vomiting from N. bulbocodium.|$|E
5|$|Planting near {{other members}} of the cabbage family, or where these plants have been placed in {{previous}} years, can prompt the spread of pests and disease. Excessive water and excessive heat <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> cultivation problems.|$|E

5|$|These viruses {{are only}} distantly {{related to the}} human parainfluenza viruses, which are RNA viruses {{belonging}} to the paramyxovirus family that are a common cause of respiratory infections in children such as croup, but <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> a disease similar to influenza in adults.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} {{evolution}} of new metabolic pathways, evolution <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> the loss of metabolic functions. For example, in some parasites metabolic processes that are not essential for survival are lost and preformed amino acids, nucleotides and carbohydrates may instead be scavenged from the host. Similar reduced metabolic capabilities are seen in endosymbiotic organisms.|$|E
5|$|Asbestos {{can cause}} a variety of lung diseases, {{including}} lung cancer. Tobacco smoking and asbestos have a synergistic effect on the formation of lung cancer. In smokers who work with asbestos, the risk of lung cancer is increased 45-fold compared to the general population. Asbestos <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> cancer of the pleura, called mesothelioma (which is different from lung cancer).|$|E
50|$|Packet loss <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>caused</b> by {{a packet}} drop attack.|$|R
50|$|Sensitization to Rhc antigens <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>caused</b> {{by blood}} transfusion.|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of Henson's death, doctor David Gelmont first {{announced}} that he died from Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterial infection that causes bacterial pneumonia. However, on May 29, Gelmont later confirmed that Henson's {{cause of death was}} organ failure resulting from streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (caused by Streptococcus pyogenes). S. pyogenes is the bacterial species that causes strep throat, scarlet fever, and rheumatic fever. It <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> other infections.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the {{trochlear nerve}} (IV) <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> {{diplopia}} with the eye adducted and elevated. The {{result will be}} an eye which can not move downwards properly (especially downwards when in an inward position). This is due to impairment in the superior oblique muscle, which is innervated by the trochlear nerve.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} of flocks <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> problems. Common {{starlings}} may be sucked into aircraft jet engines, {{one of the}} worst instances of this being an incident in Boston in 1960, when sixty-two people died after a turboprop airliner flew into a flock and plummeted into the sea at Winthrop Harbor.|$|E

50|$|In this spin- system, the {{degradation}} {{is due to}} the loss of purity of the reference frame state. On the other hand, degradation <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> by misalignment of background reference. It has been shown, in such case, the longevity has a linear relation with the size of the reference frame.|$|R
50|$|Concerns {{about running}} time <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>cause</b> for removal or {{shortening}} of scenes.|$|R
5|$|The main {{inert gas}} in air is {{nitrogen}}, but nitrogen {{is not the}} only gas that can cause DCS. Breathing gas mixtures such as trimix and heliox include helium, which <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> decompression sickness. Helium both enters and leaves the body faster than nitrogen, so different decompression schedules are required, but, since helium does not cause narcosis, it is preferred over nitrogen in gas mixtures for deep diving.|$|E
5|$|Weld spatter, {{while not}} {{affecting}} {{the integrity of}} the weld, damages its appearance and increases cleaning costs. It can be caused by excessively high current, a long arc, or arc blow, a condition associated with direct current characterized by the electric arc being deflected away from the weld pool by magnetic forces. Arc blow <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> porosity in the weld, as can joint contamination, high welding speed, and a long welding arc, especially when low-hydrogen electrodes are used.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
50|$|Hyperkeratosis <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>caused</b> by B-Raf {{inhibitor}} {{drugs such}} as Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib.|$|R
50|$|Aortic rupture <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>caused</b> by non-traumatic mechanisms, {{particularly}} abdominal {{aortic aneurysm}} rupture.|$|R
50|$|Acute {{uric acid}} {{nephropathy}} <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>caused</b> by an acute attack of gout.|$|R
5|$|Although many natural toxins are {{secondary}} metabolites, these poisons {{also include}} peptides and proteins. An {{example of a}} toxic peptide is alpha-amanitin, which is found in relatives of the death cap mushroom. This is a potent enzyme inhibitor, in this case preventing the RNA polymerase II enzyme from transcribing DNA. The algal toxin microcystin is also a peptide and is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases. This toxin can contaminate water supplies after algal blooms and is a known carcinogen that <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> acute liver hemorrhage and death at higher doses.|$|E
5|$|Being a hunt-driven dog, the Jack Russell {{will usually}} pursue most creatures that it encounters. This {{includes}} the skunk, and the breed {{is prone to}} skunk toxic shock syndrome. The chemical in the skunk spray is absorbed by the dog and causes the red blood cells to undergo haemolysis, which can occasionally lead to fatal anaemia and kidney failure. If sprayed underground, it <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> chemical burning of the cornea. Treatments are available to flush the toxin out of the dog's system.|$|E
5|$|Foreign bodies, {{especially}} {{small pieces}} of hay or straw, can become lodged {{in the eyes of}} guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer. Hay or straw dust <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> sneezing. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal.|$|E
50|$|Hyperprolactinaemia <b>can</b> <b>also</b> {{be a part}} {{of normal}} body changes during {{pregnancy}} and breastfeeding. It <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>caused</b> by diseases affecting the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. It <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>caused</b> by disruption of the normal regulation of prolactin levels by drugs, medicinal herbs and heavy metals inside the body. Hyperprolactinaemia may also be the result of disease of other organs such as the liver, kidneys, ovaries and thyroid.|$|R
25|$|At high optical powers, {{scattering}} <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>caused</b> by nonlinear optical {{processes in}} the fiber.|$|R
50|$|Low drug {{concentrations}} <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>caused</b> {{when the}} fruit suppresses drug absorption from the intestine.|$|R
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs are {{sensitive}} to light intensity, and emerge at twilight, calling numerous times and answering their neighbors' calls before going off to forage. Just before dawn, they also communicate again {{on their way to}} their sleep site. Cold temperatures <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> individuals to retire to their sleeping site as early as two hours before dawn. Their eye shine creates a unique pattern among lemurs because they tend to bob their heads up and down and from side to side.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} have concurrent obstructive sleep apnea, a condition characterized by snoring, brief episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing) during the night, interrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. In OHS, sleepiness may be worsened by elevated {{blood levels of}} carbon dioxide, which causes drowsiness ("CO2 narcosis"). Other symptoms present in both conditions are depression, and hypertension (high blood pressure) {{that is difficult to}} control with medication. The high carbon dioxide <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> headaches, which tend to be worsening in the morning.|$|E
5|$|People with TBI are {{provided}} with supplemental oxygen and may need mechanical ventilation. Employment of certain measures such as Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and ventilation at higher-than-normal pressures may be helpful in maintaining adequate oxygenation. However, such measures can also increase leakage of air through a tear, and can stress the sutures in a tear that has been surgically repaired; therefore the lowest possible airway pressures that still maintain oxygenation are typically used. Mechanical ventilation <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> pulmonary barotrauma when high pressure is required to ventilate the lungs. Techniques such as pulmonary toilet (removal of secretions), fluid management, and treatment of pneumonia are employed to improve pulmonary compliance (the elasticity of the lungs).|$|E
50|$|Liver damage <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>caused</b> by drugs, {{particularly}} paracetamol {{and drugs}} {{used to treat}} cancer.|$|R
50|$|Expressive aphasia <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>caused</b> by {{trauma to}} the brain, tumor, {{cerebral}} hemorrhage by extradural hematoma.|$|R
50|$|Connective tissue {{diseases}} {{can have}} strong or weak inheritance risks, and <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be <b>caused</b> by environmental factors.|$|R
