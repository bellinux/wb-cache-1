5|$|The acute oral {{toxicity}} for chromium(VI) ranges between 50 and 150µg/kg. In the body, chromium(VI) {{is reduced}} by several mechanisms to chromium(III) already in the blood before it enters the cells. The chromium(III) is excreted from the body, whereas the <b>chromate</b> <b>ion</b> is transferred into the cell by a transport mechanism, by which also sulfate and phosphate ions enter the cell. The acute toxicity of chromium(VI) is due to its strong oxidational properties. After it reaches the blood stream, it damages the kidneys, the liver and blood cells through oxidation reactions. Hemolysis, renal, and liver failure result. Aggressive dialysis can be therapeutic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The layered double {{hydroxide}} (LDH) of Zn with Cr {{on treatment}} with a hypochlorite solution releases <b>chromate</b> <b>ions</b> {{as a result}} of oxidative leaching by a dissolution–reprecipitation mechanism. The resi-due is found to be e-Zn(OH) 2. The LDH of Mg with Cr on the other hand is resistant to oxidative leaching. In contrast, a X-ray amorphous gel of the coprecipitated hydroxides of Mg and Cr yields <b>chromate</b> <b>ions.</b> These results suggest that the oxidation potential of Cr(III) in LDHs is determined {{by the nature of the}} divalent ion and the crystallinity of the phase while being unaffected by the nature of the intercalated a ions...|$|R

While the chromate uptake is quantitative in the LDH containing 33 mol% Al, the uptake is only 58 % of the stoichiometric value in the LDH containing 25 mol% Al. This indicates that the lower symmetry of the NO 3 − ions in the LDH with 33 mol% Al facilitates the intercalation of <b>chromate</b> <b>ions</b> even under conditions of equilibration with excess dissolved nitrate <b>ions.</b> The <b>chromate</b> uptake obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm suggesting that the entire interlayer region of the LDH behaves like a surface.

The CrO 2 - 4 uptake capacity {{is independent of}} the anion in the starting LDH but is higher when x = 0. 25 (3. 60 meq g- 1) as compared to x = 0. 33 (2. 40 meq g- 1). These values are higher than those observed for control compounds Î²-Ni(OH) 2 (1. 86 meq g- 1) and FeO(OH) (1. 26 meq g- 1), which {{do not have any}} interlayer chemistry, showing that chromate uptake takes place by its incorporation in the interlayer region by a stoichiometric anion-exchange reaction, rather than by adsorption. Nevertheless, the interaction between the LDH and the <b>chromate</b> <b>ions</b> is weak. The weak interaction is due to the mismatch between the symmetry of the <b>chromate</b> <b>ions</b> and the symmetry of the interlayer site, which introduces turbostratic disorder in the chromate-intercalated LDHs.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of <b>chromate</b> <b>ions</b> by Fe(OH) 2 and the iron (II) -iron (III) hydroxysulphate green rust, GR(SO 4 2 -), was studied {{to evaluate whether}} such synthetic layered hydroxides and the corresponding natural green rust mineral could {{be involved in the}} natural attenuation of contaminated environments. The resulting Cr (III) bearing phases, which would govern the subsequent behaviour of chromium, were clearly characterised. Both compounds proved to be very reactive and oxidised instantaneously while <b>chromate</b> <b>ions</b> were reduced to Cr (III) as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Mass balance (ICP-AES) demonstrated that the Fe/Cr ratio inside the solid end product was equal to the initial Fe/Cr ratio.

Chromate accelerated corrosion and dezincification at pH 2. 4 by acting as depolarizer but chromate suppressed efficiently the corrosion and dezincification at pH 8. 5. At pH 7. 0 the corrosion and dezincification suppressed in the presence of chromate but the inhibition action started to deteriorate at chromate concentration less than 0. 005 mol/L. The inhibition effect is attributed to adsorption of <b>chromate</b> <b>ions</b> on the corroding surface and improvement of the passivity. Chromate led to an increase in the concentration of copper species in solution due to the formation of the more soluble CuCrO 4 than Cu 2 O, which contributed to the apparent suppression of dezincification...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{removal of}} <b>chromate</b> <b>ions</b> in trace {{concentration}} from tannery wastewater effluent using Ion exchange technique {{was carried out}} by varying parameters such as Chromate concentration and contact time. A maximum of 99 % removal efficiency in the batch Ion exchange process was achieved over an equilibrium contact time of 20 min. The equilibrium uptake of chromate was constant at average 9. 8 mg/L for initial chromate concentration of 10 mg/L irrespective of the high concentration of chloride and sulphate ions in the wastewater. This inferred that the interference of these co-ions have no significant effect on the chromate uptake by the ions exchange resins used in this study. While, in the column experiments high effectiveness in the removal of <b>chromate</b> <b>ions</b> in trace concentration was observed. A removal efficiency of 98 % of chromate removal was achieved even in the presence of high concentration of competing Ions.

In very acidic pH, the silver chromate is soluble, and in alkaline pH the silver precipitated as hydroxide.|$|E
