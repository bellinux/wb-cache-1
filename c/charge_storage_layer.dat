We investigated the charge trapping characteristics of the film. When the applied voltage between the gate and the substrate is increased, the hysteresis window of capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics becomes larger, which is caused by the charge trapping in the film. For a fabricated Al-O capacitor structure, we clarified experimentally that the maximum capacitance in the C-V hysteresis agrees well with the series capacitance of insulators and that the minimum capacitance agrees well with the series capacitance of the semiconductor depletion layer and stacked insulator. When the Al content in the Al-rich Al 2 O 3 is increased, a large charge trap density is obtained. When the Al content in the Al-O is changed from 40 to 58 %, the charge trap density increases from 0 to 18 × 1018 cm- 3, which is 2. 6 times larger than that of the trap memory using SiN as the <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> <b>layer.</b> The device structure would be promising for low-cost nonvolatile memory. © 2011 Elsevier B.

On the other hand, Pt nanodots have also been investigated for memory devices that utilize discrete metal nanodots as <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> medium [5, 6].

However, most researchers used high-temperature rapid thermal annealing (RTA) of ultrathin Pt films to achieve high-density Pt nanodots [5, 8, 9], which might cause the formation of an additional interfacial layer between the high-permittivity (high-k) tunnel layer and silicon substrate as well as crystallization of the tunnel layer.|$|R

Tunnel oxide nitridation was implemented on the device under study to enhance its immunity to charge loss mechanism.

The findings have indicated that these tail bits are attributed to randomly distributed defects due to extensive program/erase cycling stress. Furthermore, these tail bits enhanced with longer storage duration at room temperature but deterred at high storage temperature.

Conversely, λ-MnO 2 is a well-studied cathode for lithium ion batteries with a high capacity and rate for <b>charge</b> <b>storage,</b> which is known to degrade quickly, especially at elevated temperatures. In this work, we study both pseudocapacitive Mn O 2 and λ-MnO 2 using computational chemistry and experimental techniques. Computationally, the <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> properties of these two materials are framed within a band-diagram and electronic structure framework to elucidate the e_ect of physical properties such as band gap, work function, point of zero charge, and pH on <b>charge</b> <b>storage.</b> Experimentally, thicknesses up to 200 nm of MnO grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) are converted by electrochemical treatment into pseudocapacitive NaMn 4 O 8 and spinel LiMn 2 O 4. By studying the electrochemical properties of pseudocapacitive NaMn 4 O 8 and spinel LiMn 2 O 4 at varying thicknesses, a more detailed mechanistic understanding for <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> in each material is established. This powerful combination of theoretical and experimental techniques provides a detailed picture of <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> in these materials, which can be extended to other electrochemical <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> materials...|$|R
40|$|The <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> in the a-Si:H PIN {{photodiode}} {{under different}} light wavelength illuminations has been studied. The leakage current-voltage and capacitance-voltage curves under three fundamental visible light wavelengths, i. e., red, {{green and blue}} light were measured. The apparent <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> density in the negative voltage range was quantified from the capacitance-voltage curve; charges in the positive voltage range were estimated from the leakage current-voltage curve. The measurement was verified with a pre-fabricated circuit which is a <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> readout device. The diode under the long wavelength light illumination condition stored more charges than that under the short wavelength light illumination condition because the former could penetrate the intrinsic a-Si:H layer deeper than the latter could. The leakage current and <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacity of the diode {{are determined by the}} generation of electron-hole pairs and the depletion of charges in the intrinsic layer as well as the supply of charges from the electrodes. A comparison of <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacities of diodes with different intrinsic layer thicknesses is also presented. The number of photogenerated carriers increases with the thickness of the i-layer due to the long penetration depth, but the junction capacitance decreases which results in the decrease of the <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacity. The tradeoff between the photogenerated carriers and the capacitance, combined with thickness-dependent recombination mechanisms increases the complexity of the PIN diode <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacity. The n+- and p+-contact region should be heavily doped so that the <b>storage</b> <b>charge</b> can be confined in the i-layer without diffusing and recombining in the contact region. The n+ and p+ films, prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) {{of a wide range of}} doping concentration, were fabricated to achieve low bulk resistivity and ohmic contacts with the metal electrodes. <b>Charge</b> <b>storage</b> density was improved after the optimization doped layers in both positive gate voltage and negative gate voltage. The low resistivity contact layers, reduced density of state in the intrinsic layer, and graded p+/i layer account for the enhancement of the <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> density in the optimized diode...|$|R
