40|$|Calculated valve area depicts {{anatomical}} stenosis {{but does}} not quantify hemodynamic impairment. We propose that hemodynamic resistance, defined as the mean pressure gradient across the valve divided by mean flow rate during systolic ejection, gives a better indication of hemodynamic obstruction. This index was compared with Gorlin valve area in 40 patients with aortic stenosis. <b>Calculated</b> <b>area</b> ranged from 0. 22 to 1. 26 cm 2, and mean transvalvular resistance ranged from 117 to 1, 244 dyne. sec. cm 5. In general, resistance varied inversely with <b>calculated</b> <b>area,</b> but there was substantial variation about the mean relation. All of the variation could {{be accounted for by}} variations in the pressure gradients at each value of <b>calculated</b> <b>area.</b> Resistance was higher in proportion to area when flow and pressure gradient were high. Analysis of five published studies of a total of 83 valves showed that <b>calculated</b> <b>area</b> changed at least three times more than resistance when pressure gradient was varied. The utility of resistance as an index of stenosis is demonstrated by example calculations that show how during exercise a stenotic valve increases the ventricular work rate out of proportion to the work done on the peripheral resistance. These calculations are possible because hemodynamic resistance defines functional impairment in units commonly used for quantification o...|$|E

Using GIS, we <b>calculated</b> <b>area</b> of each digitized patch in each burn. Since airboat tracks constituted linear depressions that were often attractive to wading birds, we digitized airboat track length within each survey area using files provided by FWC and DOQQs and calculated airboat track area by multiplying length by 2 m (approximate airboat width). Then we used the clip function in ArcGIS to determine vegetation types in survey areas and burn units to determine area of Sloughs Adjacent to Burns using vegetation polygons determined by Rutchey et al. (2005). We subtracted Track area (approximately 80 % through grass and 20 % through slough) from Grass and Slough since burned areas were digitized to exclude tracks. We lumped the very detailed vegetation classifications from Rutchey et al. (2005) to match our broad habitat categories, and <b>calculated</b> <b>area</b> of each of our habitat categories: Burn, Grass, Tree Island, Slough, Sloughs Adjacent to Burns, and Track. <b>Calculated</b> <b>area</b> of burn and slough type changed when each additional burn was conducted.
