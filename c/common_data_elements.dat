The Common Data Element Team developed general <b>common</b> <b>data</b> <b>elements,</b> which are commonly collected in clinical studies regardless of therapeutic area, such as demographics. In the present project, we applied such approaches to data collection in Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), a neurological disorder that involves multiple organ systems. To develop FRDA <b>common</b> <b>data</b> <b>elements,</b> FRDA experts formed a working group and subgroups to define elements in the following: ataxia and performance measures; biomarkers; cardiac and other clinical outcomes; and demographics, laboratory tests, and medical history. The basic development process included identification of international experts in FRDA clinical research, meeting by teleconference to develop a draft of standardized <b>common</b> <b>data</b> <b>elements</b> recommendations, vetting of recommendations across the subgroups, and dissemination of recommendations to the research community for public comment. The full recommendations were published online in September 2011 at [URL] The subgroups' recommendations are classified as core, supplemental, or exploratory. Template case report forms were created {{for many of the}} core tests. The present set of data elements should ideally lead to decreased initiation time for clinical research studies and greater ability to compare and analyze data across studies. Their incorporation into new, ongoing studies will be assessed in an ongoing fashion to define their utility in FRDA. Journal ArticleResearch Support, N. I. H. ExtramuralResearch Support, Non-U. S.

Methods: We conducted an internet-based survey of 91 centers affiliated with a university to assess their definitions of <b>common</b> <b>data</b> <b>elements</b> (CDEs) and compared their responses with standardized definitions, including those from the American College of Cardiology (ACC). Results: More than half (52 %) of centers completed the survey.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} enable {{secondary}} use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) by bridging the interoperability gap between clinical care and research domains, in this paper, a unified methodology and the supporting framework is introduced which brings together {{the power of}} metadata registries (MDR) and semantic web technologies. We introduce a federated semantic metadata registry framework by extending the ISO/IEC 11179 standard, and enable integration of <b>data</b> <b>element</b> registries through Linked Open Data (LOD) principles where each <b>Common</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Element</b> (CDE) can be uniquely referenced, queried and processed to enable the syntactic and semantic interoperability. Each CDE and their components are maintained as LOD resources enabling semantic links with other CDEs, terminology systems and with implementation dependent content models; hence facilitating semantic search, much effective reuse and semantic interoperability across different application domains. There are several important efforts addressing the semantic interoperability in healthcare domain such as IHE DEX profile proposal, CDISC SHARE and CDISC 2 RDF. Our architecture complements these by providing a framework to interlink existing <b>data</b> <b>element</b> registries and repositories for multiplying their potential for semantic interoperability to a greater extent. Open source implementation of the federated semantic MDR framework {{presented in this paper}} is the core of the semantic interoperability layer of the SALUS project which enables the execution of the post marketing safety analysis studies on top of existing EHR systems...|$|R

The <b>common</b> <b>data</b> <b>element</b> (CDE) is a consensus-based <b>data</b> <b>element</b> for <b>data</b> harmonization and sharing between clinical researchers, it can support data standards adoption and mapping. However, {{the lack of}} a suitable methodology has become a barrier to data standard adoption. Our aim was to demonstrate an approach that allowed clinical researchers to design electronic case report forms (eCRFs) that complied with the data standard. MethodsWe used a multi-technique approach, including information retrieval, natural language processing and an ontology-based knowledgebase to facilitate data standard adoption using the eCRF design. The approach took research questions as query texts with the aim of retrieving and associating relevant CDEs with the research questions. ResultsThe approach was implemented using a CDE-based eCRF builder, which was evaluated using CDE- related questions from CRFs used in the Parkinson Disease Biomarker Program, as well as CDE-unrelated questions from a technique support website. Our approach had a precision of 0. 84, a recall of 0. 80, a F-measure of 0. 82 and an error of 0. 31. Using the 303 testing CDE-related questions, our approach responded and provided suggested CDEs for 88. 8 % (269 / 303) of the study questions with a 90. 3 % accuracy (243 / 269). The reason for any missed and failed responses was also analyzed. ConclusionThis study demonstrates an approach that helps to cross the barrier that inhibits data standard adoption in eCRF building and our evaluation reveals the approach has satisfactory performance.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionMedical {{documentation}} is a time-consuming {{task and}} there is a growing number of documentation requirements. In order to improve documentation, harmonization and standardization based on existing forms and medical concepts are needed. Systematic analysis of forms can contribute to standardization building upon new methods for automated comparison of forms. Objectives of this research are quantification and comparison of data elements for breast and prostate cancer to discover similarities, differences and reuse potential between documentation sets. In addition, <b>common</b> <b>data</b> <b>elements</b> for each entity should be identified by automated comparison of forms. Materials and methodsA collection of 57 forms regarding prostate and breast cancer from quality management, registries, clinical documentation of two university hospitals (Erlangen, Münster), research datasets, certification requirements and trial documentation were transformed into the Operational Data Model (ODM). These ODM-files were semantically enriched with concept codes and analyzed with the compareODM algorithm. Comparison results were aggregated and lists of common concepts were generated. Grid images, dendrograms and spider charts were used for illustration. ResultsOverall, 1008 data elements for prostate cancer and 1232 data elements for breast cancer were analyzed. Average routine documentation consists of 390 data elements per disease entity and site. Comparisons of forms identified up to 20 comparable data elements in cancer conference forms from both hospitals. Urology forms contain up to 53 comparable data elements with quality management and up to 21 with registry forms. Urology documentation of both hospitals contains up to 34 comparable items with international <b>common</b> <b>data</b> <b>elements.</b> Clinical documentation sets share up to 24 comparable data elements with trial documentation. Within clinical documentation administrative items are most common comparable items. Selected common medical concepts are contained in up to 16 forms. DiscussionThe amount of documentation for cancer patients is enormous. There is an urgent need for standardized structured single source documentation. Semantic annotation is time-consuming, but enables automated comparison between different form types, hospital sites and even languages. This approach can help to identify <b>common</b> <b>data</b> <b>elements</b> in medical documentation. Standardization of forms and building up forms on the basis of coding systems is desirable. Several comparable data elements within the analyzed forms demonstrate the harmonization potential, which would enable better data reuse.

Methods: The {{purpose of this article is}} to illustrate our experience with a stroke patient registry at a comprehensive stroke center and highlight advantages, disadvantages, and lessons learned in the process of designing, implementing, and maintaining a stroke registry. We detail the process of stroke registry methodology, <b>common</b> <b>data</b> <b>element</b> (CDE) definitions, the generation of manuscripts from a registry, and the limitations. Advantages: The largest advantage of a registry is the ability to prospectively add patients, while allowing investigators to go back and collect information retrospectively if needed. The continuous addition of new patients increases the sample size of studies from year to year, and it also allows reflection on clinical practices from previous years and the ability to investigate trends in patient management over time. Limitations: The greatest limitation in this registry pertains to our single-entry technique where multiple sites of data entry and transfer may generate errors within the registry. Lessons Learned: To reduce the potential for errors and maximize the accuracy and efficiency of the registry, we invest significant time in training competent registry users and project leaders. With effective training and transition of leadership positions, which are continuous and evolving processes, we have attempted to optimize our clinical research registry for knowledge gain and quality improvement at our center...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Advances in {{molecular}} biology and growing requirements from biomarker validation studies have generated {{a need for}} tissue banks to provide quality-controlled tissue samples with standardized clinical annotation. The NCI Cooperative Prostate Cancer Tissue Resource (CPCTR) is a distributed tissue bank that comprises four academic centers and provides thousands of clinically annotated prostate cancer specimens to researchers. Here we describe the CPCTR information management system architecture, <b>common</b> <b>data</b> <b>element</b> (CDE) development, query interfaces, data curation, and quality control. Methods Data managers review the medical records to collect and continuously update information for the 145 clinical, pathological and inventorial CDEs that the Resource maintains for each case. An Access-based data entry tool provides de-identification and a standard communication mechanism between each group and a central CPCTR database. Standardized automated quality control audits have been implemented. Centrally, an Oracle database has web interfaces allowing multiple user-types, including the general public, to mine de-identified information {{from all of the}} sites with three levels of specificity and granularity as well as to request tissues through a formal letter of intent. Results Since July 2003, CPCTR has offered over 6, 000 cases (38, 000 blocks) of highly characterized prostate cancer biospecimens, including several tissue microarrays (TMA). The Resource developed a website with interfaces for the general public as well as researchers and internal members. These user groups have utilized the web-tools for public query of summary data on the cases that were available, to prepare requests, and to receive tissues. As of December 2005, the Resource received over 130 tissue requests, of which 45 have been reviewed, approved and filled. Additionally, the Resource implemented the TMA Data Exchange Specification in its TMA program and created a computer program for calculating PSA recurrence. Conclusion Building a biorepository infrastructure that meets today's research needs involves time and input of many individuals from diverse disciplines. The CPCTR can provide large volumes of carefully annotated prostate tissue for research initiatives such as Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs) and for biomarker validation studies and its experience can help development of collaborative, large scale, virtual tissue banks in other organ systems. </p...|$|R

40|$|While {{substance}} use problems {{are considered to}} be common in medical settings, they are not systematically assessed and diagnosed for treatment management. Research data suggest that the majority of individuals with a {{substance use}} disorder either do not use treatment or delay treatment-seeking for over a decade. The separation of substance abuse services from mainstream medical care and a lack of preventive services for substance abuse in primary care can contribute to under-detection of substance use problems. When fully enacted in 2014, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 2010 will address these barriers by supporting preventive services for substance abuse (screening, counseling) and integration of substance abuse care with primary care.

40|$|ABSTRACT: C 4 I Interfaces to Simulations {{are limited}} in functionality. One of the {{principle}} factors causing this {{is a lack of}} interface standards. While standards are a necessary condition, they are not sufficient. In order to have a complete interface, the data to be exchanged must be represented in both systems (C 4 I and Simulation). However, the current status is that C 4 I systems and simulations 1) do not contain the same data elements; 2) represent data differently, and 3) are often unaware of the other’s data requirements. The Joint Technical Architecture-Army (JTA-Army) mandates use of specific data models for certain classes of information systems (such as tactical C 4 I systems). Simulation developers should be cognizant of these data models in the development of new Army Simulations. The Army is using a <b>common</b> <b>data</b> base, the Joint <b>Common</b> <b>Data</b> Base (JCDB,) in it’s Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS). In order to interface effectively to Army C 4 I systems, simulations must represent the critical <b>data</b> <b>elements</b> that are 1) used to initialize the JCDB; and 2) sent between the simulations and C 4 I systems. However, often Army simulations do not contain these critical <b>data</b> <b>elements</b> which will result in functionality that must be provided by interfaces. Each <b>data</b> <b>element</b> that does not have an exact match on the simulation side causes a translation/transformation to occur, with resulting cost and complexity. Since any interface must align any differences, the interface can become quite complex. This paper compares an Army C 4 I Data Model of the JCDB to a simulation representation (an Army Modeling an...|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{developed}} a Web-based system that provides summary information about clinical trials being conducted throughout the United States. The first version of the system, publicly available in February 2000, contains more than 4, 000 records representing primarily trials sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. The impetus for this system {{has come from the}} Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Modernization Act of 1997, which mandated a registry of both federally and privately funded clinical trials “of experimental treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. ” The system design and implementation have been guided by several principles. First, all stages of system development were guided by the needs of the primary intended audience, patients {{and other members of the}} public. Second, broad agreement on a <b>common</b> set of <b>data</b> <b>elements</b> was obtained. Third, the system was designed in a modular and extensible way, and search methods that take extensive advantage of the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) were developed. Finally, since this will be a long-term effort involving many individuals and organizations, the project is being implemented in several phases...|$|R
