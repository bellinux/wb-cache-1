We found that fundus spectroscopy and spectrally-resolved imaging allow for non-invasive real-time monitoring and dosimetry of TTT.

40|$|The {{launch of}} SAR {{satellites}} with high resolution and dual receive antenna capabilities opens new possibilities for traffic monitoring applications {{on a global}} scale. Thus {{it will be possible}} to detect cars and measure their speed from the acquired along track interferometric data. The development of vehicle detection algorithms requires the knowledge of the radar signatures of vehicles, especially under consideration of the geometry of the radar look direction and the vehicle orientation. In this paper the radar signatures of the non-moving cars are presented. They are estimated experimentally from airborne E-SAR multi-frequency and polarimetric data, which have been collected during a flight campaign in 2003. Radar signatures are estimated for a considerable part of aspect angles ranging from 0 º to 180 º. The large synthetic aperture length of the E-SAR radar sensor allows the look processing of data and therefore allows an increase of the aspect angle resolution. The radar signature analysis for one type of passenger cars showed that the largest radar cross section values and thus the greatest chance for high probability of detection are for cars standing in rear and front view of radar beam direction. This holds true for all frequencies and co-polarizations. Radar cross section values for <b>cross-polarizations</b> and diagonal views are much lower and are therefore less suitable for car detection. The radar signature profile over a considerable range of aspect angles in fine resolution can be used further for the verification of simulation studies and for the performance prediction for traffic monitoring with a coming German TerraSAR-X satellite...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} new type of orthomode {{transducer}} (OMT), involving the integration of a quasi-optical component, namely a wire grid polarizer (WGP), with an E-plane probe transition, in a waveguide topology. The goal has been to create a lightweight and compact device for waveguide integration, capable of covering all frequency channels to be used by the FIRE instrument¤. The design consists of a metallic split block, in which a quadratic waveguide supporting the two fundamental modes of propagation (TE 10 and TE 01), is formed using regular CNC milling. Just as its quasi-optical counterpart, i. e. a free standing WGP, a waveguide integrated WGP insert is used to separate the two orthogonal TE modes, which are either reflected or transmitted (depending on polarization). A planar E-plane waveguide probe transition realized on a GaAs membrane is used inside a square waveguide to extract the reflected mode without affecting the transmitted mode. For a first proof of concept the OMT has been designed for the possibility of full characterization and therefore the transmitted mode is guided through a stepped impedance transformer to a standard rectangular waveguide interface, while a second E-plane probe transition to a rectangular waveguide, is used for the reflected mode. Simulations carried out using Ansoft HFSS show that the OMT design can be made relatively broadband (currently about ~ 14 % with a return loss better than 15 dBs) and with <b>cross-polarizations</b> better than 30 dB. The probe and WGP can be manufactured using high precision photolithography or E-beam lithography making it scalable to both lower and higher frequency bands. Assembling an OMT of this type involves mounting of small membrane structures (< 1 mm) into waveguides and the design can thus be subject to misalignment errors which may degrade the performance. Hence, a tolerance analysis identifying the most sensitive parameters will be presented together with the different design trade-offs. Practical aspects regarding the assembly of the waveguide probe and WGP into the block will also be presented along with S-parameters measurements. It is the belief of the authors that this new type of OMT concept will allow for broadband operation with relative low losses at high frequencies (i. e. above 600 GHz), where regular WGPs so far has been the most common way to separate two signals of orthogonal polarizations...|$|R

In many practical cases, especially for high-level M-QAM modulations, the communication system cannot tolerate the experienced levels of <b>cross-polarization</b> interference and an improved suppression is necessary.

40|$|Radar sensors {{have the}} {{potential}} to retrieve vertical forest structure measurements thanks to their capability to penetrate into the foliage. However, studies are needed in order to understand better the interaction of radar beams with the canopy. The most commonly used radar technique for estimating forest parameters operates from spacecraft at different wavelength (X-, C-, and L-band). In order to assist in the interpretation of satellite data for forest applications, and as a possible complementary technique to Lidar (Light detection and ranging), the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute has developed the first helicopter-borne profiling radar system operating in Ku-band, called Tomoradar, which is able to provide a vertical canopy profile. The study focuses on the analyses of Ku-band profiling radar waveforms and the backscatter signal of boreal forest, supported by simultaneously acquired Lidar measurements, in order to detect ground and canopy profiles and quantify the ground echo ratio under different canopy coverage and the backscatter signal variation through the vegetation. The Tomoradar data was acquired simultaneously with a lightweight Velodyne VLP- 16 Lidar system in October 2016 over a boreal forest located in Evo in southern Finland. Additionally, highly accurate Riegl VQ- 480 Lidar data, acquired in 2014, was used as a ground reference for both lightweight systems. We analysed the co- and cross-polarized (HH and HV) Tomoradar backscatter signals of a 600 m long profile. It is found that the Ku-band Tomoradar penetrates the canopy to a similar extent as the Velodyne Lidar, i. e., the distribution of backscatter signals through the vegetation follows the vegetation density. Moreover, the ground backscatter signal strength and ground echo ratio depend strongly on the presence of gaps in the canopy. By comparing the elevation of the corresponding canopy and ground Tomoradar signal peaks with the Velodyne Lidar data, the Tomoradar ground elevation accuracy is on average − 0. 03 m and − 0. 20 m for the cross- and co-polarization, respectively, whereas the bias of the canopy elevation is, on average, − 0. 58 m and 1. 35 m for the cross- and co-polarization, respectively. With respect to the ground height data derived from the Lidar measurements of 2014, the Tomoradar ground profile reveals, on average, higher accuracy (i. e., 0. 00 m (σ = 0. 41 m) and 0. 04 m (σ = 0. 37 m) for the co-and <b>cross-polarizations,</b> respectively) than the Velodyne system (− 0. 37 m with σ = 0. 25 m) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{knowledge}} of {{spatial and temporal}} variability of soil water content and others soil-vegetation variables (leaf area index, fractional cover) assumes high importance in crop management. Where and when the cloudiness limits the use of optical and thermal remote sensing techniques, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has proven to have several advantages (cloud penetration, day/night acquisitions and high spatial resolution). However, measured backscattering is controlled by several factors including SAR configuration (acquisition geometry, frequency and polarization), and target dielectric and geometric properties. Thus, uncertainties arise about the more suitable configuration to be used. With {{the launch of the}} ALOS Palsar, Cosmo-Skymed and Sentinel 1 sensors, a dataset of multi-frequency (X, C, L) and multi-polarization (co-and <b>cross-polarizations)</b> images are now available from a virtual constellation; thus, significant issues concerning the retrieval of soil-vegetation variables using SAR are: (i) identifying the more suitable SAR configuration; (ii) understanding the affordability of a multi-frequency approach. In 2006, a vast dataset of both remotely sensed images (SAR and optical/thermal) and in situ data was collected in the framework of the AgriSAR 2006 project funded by ESA and DLR. Flights and sampling have taken place weekly from April to August. In situ data included soil water content, soil roughness, fractional coverage and Leaf Area Index (LAI). SAR airborne data consisted of multi-frequency and multi-polarized SAR images (X, C and L frequencies and HH, HV, VH and VV polarizations). By exploiting this very wide dataset, this paper, explores the capabilities of SAR in describing four of the main soil-vegetation variables (SVV). As a first attempt, backscattering and SVV temporal behaviors are compared (dynamic analysis) and single-channel regressions between backscattering and SVV are analyzed. Remarkably, no significant correlations were found between backscattering and soil roughness (over both bare and vegetated plots), whereas it has been noticed that the contributions of water content of soil underlying the vegetation often did not influence the backscattering (depending on canopy structure and SAR configuration). Most significant regressions were found between backscattering and SVV characterizing the vegetation biomass (fractional cover and LAI). Secondly, the effect of SVV changes on the spatial correlation among SAR channels (accounting for different polarization and/or frequencies) was explored. An inter-channel spatial/temporal correlation analysis is proposed by temporally correlating two-channel spatial correlation and SVV. This novel approach allowed a widening in the number of significant correlations and their strengths by also encompassing the use of SAR data acquired at two different frequencies...|$|R
