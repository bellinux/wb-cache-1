2500|$|During the 1970s, {{a number}} of issues arose which were to have {{significant}} influence on the course of the Society. The first was the tax structure in the UK: for a time, capital gains were taxed at up to 40 per cent (nil on gilts); earned income was taxed in the top bracket at 83 per cent, and investment income in the top bracket at 98 per cent. Lloyd's income counted as earned income, even for Names who did not work at Lloyd's, and this heavily influenced the direction of underwriting: in short, it was desirable for syndicates to make a (small) underwriting loss but a (larger) investment gain. The investment gain was typically achieved by [...] "bond washing" [...] or [...] "gilt stripping": selling the gilt or other bond <b>cum</b> <b>dividend</b> and buying it back ex dividend, thus forfeiting the interest income in exchange for a tax-free capital gain. Syndicate funds were also moved offshore (which later created problems through fraud and self-dealing).|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{classical}} asset pricing model assuming non fully rational agents. Agents forecast future prices <b>cum</b> <b>dividend</b> through an adaptive learning rule. This assumption provides {{an explanation of}} some anomalies encountered in the empirical analysis of asset prices under full rationality: returns are serially correlated (positively over a short horizon and negatively over a longer horizon) and the dividend yield predicts future returns (positive correlation). Considering the continuous time limit process, the same regularities are established analytically for price increments...|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze the {{behavior}} of stock price on ex-dividend day in London Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange and draw a conclusion about the market efficiency based. We collect 200 sample companies dividend, ex-dividend day and <b>cum</b> <b>dividend</b> day stock price to compare with NYSE composite index and FTSE 100 for London Stock Exchange.   To answer the research question and specific purpose of our thesis we developed five null hypothesis based on raw price ratio (RPR), market-adjusted price ratio (MAPR), raw price drop ratio (RPD), market-adjusted price drop ratio (MAPD) and market-adjusted abnormal return (MAAR). We used t-statistic to find the mean differences between observed values and standard values. We also show multiple regression analysis to show the relationship between ex-dividend day stock price and dividend, cum-dividend day stock price.   This thesis documented that same amount of stock price drop in 2008 New York Stock Exchange compare with dividend amount. In this case our null hypothesis accepted. On the other hand in London Stock Exchange shows higher drop of stock price than dividend amount in 2008 against the taxation rate rules of prior study. In 2007 both stock market shows the less drop of stock price than dividend amount. Therefore our null hypothesis rejected. We also documented that London Stock Exchange more volatile than New York Stock Exchange to consider the MAAR, tax rate and standard deviation. So we find significant evidence of market abnormal return which create an opportunity of market inefficiency and arbitrage opportunity for investors.   So, our thesis output shows mixed evidence for London Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper takes a {{new look}} at the {{cross-border}} dividend-stripping transactions that gave rise to the Fifth Circuit’s opinion in Compaq v. Commissioner and the Eighth Circuit’s opinion in IES Industries v. Commissioner. In both cases, the circuit courts held for the taxpayers and rejected the Commissioner’s claim that the transactions lacked economic substance because the taxpayers were sure to lose money on the transactions before taxes. These cases generated extensive commentary that was split into two diametrically opposed camps. One group argued that the decisions were correct because the transactions were economically profitable business transactions. The other group argued that the transactions were blatant, abusive tax shelters; and that the courts should have struck them down. Because the commentators in the second group conceded that the transactions generated a pre-tax profit, these commentators also offered a range of proposals to modify or replace the pre-tax profit test. Although the tax benefit of crossborder dividend-stripping was sharply reduced by subsequent Congressional enactments, that action hid rather than resolved the issue whether the tax shelter jurisprudence is fundamentally flawed because there is a class of abusive transactions that produce a guaranteed profit before tax, but do not run afoul of the anti-abuse provisions in the tax law. This paper argues that the Compaq and IES Industries transactions do not reveal any fundamental failings with either anti-abuse jurisprudence generally or the pre-tax profit test in particular. This paper demonstrates that the circuit courts reached the wrong conclusions in those cases because the parties, the courts, and the commentators all ignored implicit taxes. That is not surprising because the implicit taxes in these cases were difficult to see. These taxes were negative implicit taxes, which drove down the <b>cum</b> <b>dividend</b> price of the stripped stock, and therefore made the transactions appear profitable before taxes. However, once implicit taxes are taken into account, the transactions in those cases are properly understood to be unprofitable before taxes. Finally, nearly ten years ago, Charlotte Crane observed that tax doctrine has all but ignored implicit taxes and she challenged commentators, lawyers and judges to think carefully about how implicit taxes can be incorporated into tax doctrine. My proposal to calculate pre-tax profit for the purpose of anti-abuse jurisprudence before both implicit and explicit taxes is, I believe, the first proposal to explicitly recognize implicit taxes in tax doctrine...|$|E
