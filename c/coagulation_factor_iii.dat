50|$|The F3 gene encodes <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> <b>III</b> {{which is}} a cell surface glycoprotein. This factor enables cells to {{initiate}} the blood coagulation cascades, and it functions as the high-affinity receptor for the coagulation factor VII. The resulting complex provides a catalytic event {{that is responsible for}} initiation of the coagulation protease cascades by specific limited proteolysis. Unlike the other cofactors of these protease cascades, which circulate as nonfunctional precursors, this factor is a potent initiator that is fully functional when expressed on cell surfaces. There are 3 distinct domains of this factor: extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic. This protein is {{the only one in the}} coagulation pathway for which a congenital deficiency has not been described. In addition to the membrane-bound tissue factor, soluble form of tissue factor was also found which results from alternatively spliced tissue factor mRNA transcripts, in which exon 5 is absent and exon 4 is spliced directly to exon 6.|$|E
40|$|Tissue factor (TF, <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> <b>III,</b> CD 142) is {{not only}} the main {{physiological}} initiator of normal blood coagulation, but is also important in the natural history of solid malignancies in that it potentiates metastasis and angiogenesis and mediates outside-in signalling. TF is expressed constitutively by many tissues which are not in contact with blood and by other cells upon injury or activation; the latter include endothelial cells, tissue macrophages, and peripheral blood monocytes. It can exist encrypted and unavailable functionally in the plasma membrane and the appearance of functional TF may be due to synthesis and/or de-encryption. Inflammatory cells often express TF and act to induce its production or de-encryption by other cells locally and, apparently, at remote sites. Inappropriate expression of TF by endothelial cells, macrophages or monocytes is thought to be an important trigger of coagulation in various pathological conditions. Several studies have shown that measurements of monocyte TF (mTF) may provide clinically significant information, particularly in patients with malignant and inflammatory diseases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Obesity {{associates}} with low-grade inflammation and adipose tissue remodeling. Using sensitive high-throughput protein arrays we here investigated adipose tissue cytokine and angiogenesis-related protein profiles from obese and lean mice, and in particular, {{the influence of}} calorie restriction (CR). Methods Tissue samples from visceral fat were harvested from obese mice fed with a high-fat diet (60 % of energy), lean controls receiving low-fat control diet {{as well as from}} obese and lean mice kept under CR (energy intake 70 % of ad libitum intake) for 50 [*]days. Protein profiles were analyzed using mouse cytokine and angiogenesis protein array kits. Results In obese and lean mice, CR was associated with 11. 3 % and 15. 6 % reductions in body weight, as well as with 4. 0 % and 4. 6 % reductions in body fat percentage, respectively. Obesity induced adipose tissue cytokine expressions, the most highly upregulated cytokines being IL- 1 ra, IL- 2, IL- 16, MCP- 1, MIG, RANTES, C 5 a, sICAM- 1 and TIMP- 1. CR increased sICAM- 1 and TIMP- 1 expression both in obese and lean mice. Overall, CR showed distinct effects on cytokine expressions; in obese mice CR largely decreased but in lean mice increased adipose tissue cytokine expressions. Obesity was also associated with increased expressions of angiogenesis-related proteins, in particular, angiogenin, endoglin, endostatin, endothelin- 1, IGFBP- 3, leptin, MMP- 3, PAI- 1, TIMP- 4, CXCL 16, platelet factor 4, DPPIV and <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> <b>III.</b> CR increased endoglin, endostatin and platelet factor 4 expressions, and decreased IGFBP- 3, NOV, MMP- 9, CXCL 16 and osteopontin expressions both in obese and lean mice. Interestingly, in obese mice, CR decreased leptin and TIMP- 4 expressions, whereas in lean mice their expressions were increased. CR decreased MMP- 3 and PAI- 1 only in obese mice, whereas CR decreased FGF acidic, FGF basic and <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> <b>III,</b> and increased angiogenin and DPPIV expression only in lean mice. Conclusions CR exerts distinct effects on adipocyte cytokine and angiogenesis profiles in obese and lean mice. Our study also underscores the importance of angiogenesis-related proteins and cytokines in adipose tissue remodeling and development of obesity. </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{issue of}} Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology {{contains}} 4 reviews on tissue factor (TF) and 1 on tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). One review on TF {{will be published}} in a later issue. In this editorial, we will briefly revisit the major advances in the field, highlight some of the current controversies, and discuss some of the future challenges. TF (also known as tissue thromboplastin or <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> <b>III)</b> was first identified as a constituent of tissue that when added to plasma activated the clotting cascade — hence the name tissue factor. TF was first purified in 1985, 1 and this subsequently led to the cloning of the TF cDNA and gene. 2 - 5 In 1989 Drake and colleagues 6 proposed that TF around blood vessels forms a “hemostatic envelope ” that initiates clotting after vessel injury. The crystal structure of the extracellular domain of TF bound to Factor VIIa (FVIIa) was reported in 1996. 7 In the same year it was discovered that inactivation of the mouse TF gene resulted in embryonic lethality. 8 - 10 Taken together, these studies indicated that TF was essential for hemostasis. Activation of the clotting cascade leads to the generation of thrombin that cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin as well as activates platelets (Figure). In 1999, the late Yale Nemerson and colleagues 11 reported that there was TF in blood of health...|$|E
40|$|SIRT 1 is a NAD (+) -dependent class III {{histone deacetylase}} (HDAC) that mediates {{the effects of}} caloric {{restriction}} on lifespan and metabolic pathways in various organisms. It deacetylates both histone and non-histone proteins, and targets proteins with diverse cellular and tissue functions. In the vasculature of rodent models SIRT 1 mediates vasodilatation via eNOS-derived nitric oxide (NO) and scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recent studies demonstrated further protective roles of SIRT 1 in vascular biology and atherosclerosis. In endothelial cells and macrophages SIRT 1 has anti-inflammatory functions by downregulating the expression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines by interfering with the NF-kB signaling pathway. Deacetylation of RelA/p 65 -NF-kB by SIRT 1 in macrophages also suppresses the expression of Lox- 1, a scavenger receptor for oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL), thereby preventing macrophage foam cell formation. Moreover, SIRT 1 {{has been shown to}} regulate the activity of Liver X-receptor (LXR), thereby promoting ABCA 1 -driven reverse cholesterol transport in plaque macrophages. Finally, SIRT 1 suppresses the expression of endothelial tissue factor (<b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> <b>III)</b> and hence exerts anti-thrombotic properties. These findings indicate atheroprotective effects of SIRT 1 in atherogenesis and highlight the need for translational research from bench-to-bedside. Indeed, SIRT 1 activators are available for experimental research and undergo clinical testing. Taken together, these studies suggest SIRT 1 activation as a promising therapeutic approach in atherosclerosis. Further studies are necessary to better understand the exact role of SIRT 1 in the protagonist cells orchestrating atherogenesis and to identify the specificity, target effects and putative off-target effects of these promising SIRT 1 activators...|$|E

40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{is one of}} {{the three}} leading causes for cancer mortality. CRC kills over 600, 000 people {{annually}} worldwide. The most common cause of death from CRC is the metastasis to distant organs. However, biomarkers for CRC metastasis remain ill-defined. We compared primary and metastatic CRC cell lines for their angiogenesis-protein profiles and intracellular signaling profiles to identify novel biomarkers for CRC metastasis. To this end, we used primary and metastatic CRC cell lines as a model system and normal human colon cell line as a control. The angiogenesis profiles two isogenic CRC cell lines, SW 480 and SW 620, and HT- 29 and T 84 revealed that VEGF was upregulated in both SW 620 and T 84 whereas <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> <b>III,</b> IGFBP- 3, DPP IV, PDGF AA/AB, endothelin I and CXCL 16 were downregulated specifically in metastatic cell lines. Furthermore, we found that TIMP- 1, amphiregulin, endostatin, angiogenin were upregulated in SW 620 whereas downregulated in T 84. Angiogenin was downregulated in T 84 and GM-CSF was also downregulated in SW 620. To induce CRC cell metastasis, we treated cells with pro-inflammatory cytokine IL- 6. Upon IL- 6 treatment, epithelial-mesenchymal transition was induced in CRC cells. When DLD- 1 and HT- 29 cells were treated with IL- 6; Akt, STAT 3, AMPKα and Bad phosphorylation levels were increased. Interestingly, SW 620 showed the same signal activation pattern with IL- 6 treatment of HT- 29 and DLD- 1. Our data suggest that Akt, STAT 3, AMPKα and Bad activation can be biomarkers for metastatic colorectal cancer. IL- 6 treatment specifically reduced phosphorylation levels of EGFR, HER 2 receptor, Insulin R and IGF- 1 R in receptor tyrosine kinase array study with HT- 29. Taken together, we have identified novel biomarkers for metastatic CRC through the angiogenesis-antibody array and intracellular signaling array studies.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{exploited}} a versatile in vitro endothelial cell/fibroblast co-culture cell system {{to investigate the}} association between angiogenesis and breast cancer by comparing the capacity of plasma from women with breast cancer and age-matched controls, to influence tubule formation and modulate angiogenesis in vitro, and to identify plasma circulating factors which might be responsible. Plasma from women with breast cancer (n= 8) (added on day 7 after co-culture establishment) significantly increased tubule formation by 57 % (P< 0. 01) when compared to cultures grown in culture medium lacking in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fetal bovine serum (FBS), whereas plasma from controls (n= 8) did not. Higher levels of VEGF, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin (IL) - 6, but not leptin, were observed in plasma samples of the breast cancer group compared to the control group (n= 20 in each group). In independent experiments, the effects of VEGF, TNF alpha, IL- 6 and leptin were assessed and {{it was found that}} tubule formation was differentially affected whether these inflammatory cytokines or adipokines were added individually or in combination to the co-culture system. Using Proteome Profiler human angiogenesis array kits, 12 out of 55 angiogenesis-related proteins were differentially expressed in plasma from the breast cancer group compared to the control group. Pro-angiogenic proteins included: amphiregulin, artemin, <b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> <b>III,</b> fibroblast growth factor (FGF) acidic, GDNF, IL- 8, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) - 1 alpha, platelet derived growth factor-AB/platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-AB/PDGF-BB) and VEGF, whereas anti-angiogenic proteins were: angiopoietin- 2, serpin F 1 and serpin B 5. In addition, FGF acidic was further identified as differentially expressed, with increased expression, when plasma samples from the normal and cancer groups, which induced an increase in tubule formation, were compared to one another. In conclusion, the present study identified angiogenesis-related proteins circulating in the serum of women with breast cancer that are likely to facilitate the growth and metastasis of breast cancer, in part through their influence on tubule formation, and, therefore, may be potential targets for new cancer therapies.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD thesis was to {{investigate}} {{of the role of}} SIRT 1 and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) coactivator 1 α (PGC- 1 α) in atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease resulting from the interaction of the vessel wall with macrophages, T cells and oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL). Rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque may result in thrombus formation and complete vessel occlusion, the primary cause of myocardial infarction and stroke. SIRT 1 and PGC- 1 α are enzymes with important functions in various metabolic and anti-inflammatory processes. SIRT 1 is a class III histone deacetylase that mediates the effects of caloric restriction on lifespan and metabolic pathways in various organisms. PGC- 1 α is a transcription coactivator involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic processes; it is a target protein of SIRT 1. To study the role of these molecules in atherosclerosis, we crossed SIRT 1 +/- or PGC- 1 α-/- with atherosclerosis-prone ApoE-/- mice, and compared ApoE-/- SIRT 1 +/+ with ApoE-/- SIRT 1 +/- mice as well as ApoE-/- PGC- 1 α+/+ with ApoE-/- PGC- 1 α-/- mice, respectively. We found that haploinsufficient ApoE-/- SIRT 1 +/- mice developed more atherosclerotic lesions than ApoE-/- SIRT 1 +/+ mice. Using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo approaches, we showed that the atheroprotective effects of SIRT 1 are mediated via suppression of NF-κB signaling: SIRT 1 prevents the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules and reduces the expression of the scavenger receptor Lox- 1 as well as macrophage foam cell formation. We further demonstrated that suppression of NF-κB signaling diminishes the expression of tissue factor (<b>coagulation</b> <b>factor</b> <b>III)</b> in human aortic endothelial cells. ApoE-/- PGC- 1 α+/+ and ApoE-/- PGC- 1 α-/- mice did not differ in the amount of their atherosclerotic lesions. ApoE-/- PGC- 1 α-/- mice had markedly reduced body and epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) weight, less plasma triglycerides, and differential expression of various pro and anti-atherogenic factors. A balance of these anti- and pro-atherogenic factors may explain the unchanged atherosclerotic phenotype of ApoE-/- PGC- 1 α-/- mice. Taken together, our data reveal that the role of PGC- 1 α in atherogenesis remains to be clarified. On the other hand, SIRT 1 has both anti-atherogenic and anti-thrombotic functions. Our findings suggest that SIRT 1 activation may be a promising therapeutic approach to impede atherosclerosis...|$|E

The calculation {{was based on a}} new PT method, which measures active <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors</b> (F II, F VII, FX) and corrects the errors caused by inactive <b>coagulation</b> <b>factors.</b> On this basis, an INR result with and without inhibition for individual patient samples was also calculated and applied to 200 plasma samples obtained from OAT patients. Conspicuous variation in inhibition between the four calibration kits was noted. The kinetics of this inhibition was closest to a noncompetitive pattern. The need of correction for INRs of single patients increases with higher INRs. At the same level of patient INRs the coagulation inhibiton varies markedly.
