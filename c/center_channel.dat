The earliest definition of hatha yoga {{is found in the}} 11th century Buddhist text Vimalaprabha, which defines it in relation to the <b>center</b> <b>channel,</b> bindu etc. Hatha yoga synthesizes elements of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras with posture and breathing exercises. [...] It marks the development of asanas (plural) into the full body 'postures' now in popular usage and, along with its many modern variations, is the style that many people associate with the word yoga today.|$|E

2500|$|Many low-end {{entertainment}} systems have a karaoke mode {{that attempts to}} remove the vocal track from regular audio CDs, using an Out Of Phase Stereo (OOPS) technique. This is done by <b>center</b> <b>channel</b> extraction, which exploits {{the fact that in}} most stereo recordings the vocals are in the center. This means that the voice, as part of the music, has equal volume on both stereo channels and no phase difference. To get the quasi-karaoke (mono) track, the left channel of the original audio is subtracted from the right channel. The Sega Saturn also has a [...] "mute vocals" [...] feature that is based on the same principle and is also able to adjust the pitch of the song to match the singer's vocal range.|$|E

In the mid-1980s, a true stereo version of the song was released on German and Japanese editions of the CD reissue of Hot Rocks 1964–1971. The stereo mix features a piano (played by session player Jack Nitzsche, who also provides the song's iconic tambourine) and acoustic guitar that are barely audible in the original mono release (both instruments are also audible on a bootleg recording of the instrumental track). This stereo mix of [...] "Satisfaction" [...] also appeared on a radio-promo CD of rare stereo tracks provided to US radio stations in the mid-1980s, but {{has not yet been}} featured on a worldwide commercial CD; even later pressings of the German and Japanese Hot Rocks CDs feature the mono mix, making the earlier releases with the stereo mix collectors' items. For the worldwide 2002 reissue of Hot Rocks, an alternative quasi-stereo mix was used featuring the lead guitar, bass, drums, and vocals in the <b>center</b> <b>channel</b> and the acoustic guitar and piano [...] "split" [...] left and right via a delay effect.|$|E
50|$|<b>Center</b> <b>channel</b> {{refers to}} an audio channel common to many {{surround}} sound formats.

5000|$|Home theater {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} popular, and their multi-channel audio requires {{five or more}} speakers rather than the two speakers of earlier stereo systems.

50|$|The {{function}} of the <b>center</b> <b>channel</b> is to anchor the signal so that any central panned images do not shift when a listener is moving or is sitting away from the sweet spot. The <b>center</b> <b>channel</b> also prevents any timbral modifications from occurring, which is typical for 2-channel stereo, due to phase differences at the two ears of a listener. The centre channel is especially used in films and television, with dialogue primarily feeding the <b>center</b> <b>channel.</b> The {{function of}} the <b>center</b> <b>channel</b> can either be of a monophonic nature (as with dialogue) {{or it can be}} used in combination with the left and right channels for true three-channel stereo. Motion Pictures tend to use the <b>center</b> <b>channel</b> for monophonic purposes with stereo being reserved purely for the left and right channels. Surround microphones techniques have however been developed that fully use the potential of three-channel stereo.|$|E

Instead he suggested feeding a center-channel speaker with a simple mix of the left and right channels; however, this is not entirely satisfactory as it degrades the stereo separation.|$|E
