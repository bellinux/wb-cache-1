The richness of our data allow us to go beyond Sutton’s bounds test and to study the underlying forces bounding concentration away from zero. Observed advertising levels escalate in larger US markets. At the same time, the number of advertised brands in an industry appears to be invariant to market size. Therefore, the size-distribution of brands across markets is characterized by bigger (i. e. more heavily advertised) as opposed to more brands in larger markets. Correspondingly, observed concentration levels in advertising-intensive industries are bounded away from zero irrespective of market size...|$|R

40|$|Though {{brand loyalty}} {{has been studied}} {{extensively}} in the marketing literature, the re-lationship between brand loyalty and equilibrium pricing strategies is not well understood. Designing sales pricing strategies involves two key decisions: the percentage reduction in price from the existing price point, and the number or frequency of promotions within a category or for a speci 8 ̆ 5 c product. These decisions, in turn, are critically dependent upon how many consumers can be convinced {{to switch to a}} brand by temporarily reducing its price, and how many are instead brand loyal. Theoretical models of how the size and strength of brand loyalty inuence optimal promotion strategies have been developed, but there are no rigorous tests of their hypotheses. We test how brand loyalty impacts promotion strategies for a frequently purchased <b>consumer</b> <b>package</b> <b>good</b> category.

Correspondingly, observed concentration levels in advertising-intensive industries are bounded away from zero irrespective of market size. For two industries, we collect historic order-of-entry data. The geographic distribution of entry is found to account for the levels, rank-orders and covariation in the geographic distribution of brand shares, perceived brand qualities and advertising effort. Interestingly, alternative potential sources of geographic asymmetry on both the supply and demand sides do not mimic the geographic patterns of shares.

40|$|Grocery {{retailers}} increasingly view {{other retail}} formats, particularly mass merchandisers, as a competitive threat. We present an empirical study of household shopping and <b>packaged</b> <b>goods</b> spending across retail formats — grocery stores, mass merchandisers, and drug stores. Our study considers competition between these formats and explores how retailer assortment, pricing and promotional policies, {{as well as}} household demographics, affect shopping behavior and expenditures in these different formats. This research is {{made possible by a}} new panel dataset collected by Information Resources Inc. (IRI) which captures <b>consumer</b> <b>packaged</b> <b>good</b> purchases made at alternative retail outlets. These purchases have previously been missed by panels that use only purchases at supermarkets. We estimate a hierarchical multivariate tobit model which captures consumer decisions about “where to shop ” and “how much to buy. ” We find that shopping and spending vary much more across than within formats, and that the retailer’s marketing mix explains more variation in shopping behavior than travel time. Of the marketing mix variables considered, we find that expenditures respond more to varying levels of assortment (in particular grocery stores) and promotion than price. This is surprising in light of the grocery industry's efforts to reduce retail assortments. Price sensitivity is most evident at grocers. Shoppers at dru...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{industrial market}} structure in <b>consumer</b> <b>package</b> <b>goods</b> (CPG) industries using a unique database spanning 31 industries and the 50 largest US metropolitan markets. In these data, the geographic cross-section of markets {{accounts for a}} much larger component of a brand’s total share variation than the time-series. Most industries exhibit striking asymmetries across markets in both a given brand’s market share and the industry’s rank-order of shares. Following Sutton’s theory of endogenous sunk costs, a robust set of gametheoretic predictions is generated regarding industrial market structure {{and the role of}} brand advertising. For non-advertising intensive industries, the lower bound on concentration falls to zero in larger markets. However, concentration is bounded below in advertising-intensive industries even as market size grows large. Connected to this finding, we observe an escalation in the level of advertising for larger markets. In contrast, the number of advertised brands does not vary with market size and, consistent with the theory, there {{does not appear to be}} an escalation in entry. Nevertheless, we do observe a proliferation in the number of non-advertised brands in larger markets. Finally, we collect historic entry dates for two of our industries an...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{industrial market}} structure in <b>consumer</b> <b>package</b> <b>goods</b> (CPG) in-dustries using a unique database spanning 31 industries and the 50 largest US metropolitan markets. A general set of stylized facts is documented pertaining {{mainly to the}} geographic patterns in brand shares. A connection between the patterns and a model of endogenous sunk costs in advertising is established by testing several predictions of the theory. We establish that concentration is bounded below in advertising-intensive industries even as market size grows large. We also find a fixed number of advertised brands within an industry across markets of varying size. However, we observe a proliferation {{in the number of}} non-advertised brands in larger markets. Finally, we collect historic entry dates for two of our industries and find that order of entry has a strong impact on the rank-order of shares in a market. The historic roll-out of brands across markets also introduces spatial covariance within a brand’s geographic distribution of shares. A similar spatial covariance pattern emerges in advertising. Alternative explanations for these geographic patterns, including other marketing instruments such as prices, are rejected. The relationship between advertising and market shares suggests a role for advertising in the formation of long-run industrial market structure...|$|R

40|$|The {{theories}} used {{to understand}} and predict regular non-problem gambling are almost exclusively affective or cognitive-oriented. These include motives, self-esteem, image enhancement and illusions of control over random events. However, gambling {{is one of the}} most frequently purchased consumer products, and the frequency of past behavior has traditionally been viewed as “habit” by psychologists and marketers. While habit as the frequency of past behavior has been shown to be a strong predictor of future behavior in gambling, habit offers little additional insight into gambling behavior in that form. The frequency of past purchasing behavior is an important input to NBD-Dirichlet models that provide an enhanced ability {{to understand and}} predict future purchases of frequently purchased <b>consumer</b> <b>package</b> <b>goods.</b> NBD-Dirichlet models have been shown to provide an excellent fit to data for a broad range of frequently purchased goods and services for countries across the world. Applications of the NBD-Dirichlet models to data concerning gambling behavior show that these models consistently provide an even closer fit to the data than with other consumer models tested. The interpretation of NBD-Dirichlet output can provide more accurate benchmarks than cognitive or affective output to test changes to the gambling environment (e. g., more games, new games, warnings) and to gamblers (e. g., problem gambling). The implications and use of the NBD-Dirichlet statistics for gambling providers and public policy is discussed. </p...|$|R
