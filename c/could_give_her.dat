5|$|At age sixteen, Stone began {{teaching}} in district schools, as her brothers and sister, Rhoda, also did. Her beginning pay of $1.00 a day was {{much lower than}} that of male teachers, and when she substituted for her brother, Bowman, one winter, she received less pay than he received. When she protested to the school committee that she had taught all the subjects Bowman had, it replied that they <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> “only a woman’s pay.” Lower pay for women was one of the arguments cited by those promoting the hiring of women as teachers: “To make education universal, it must be at moderate expense, and women can afford to teach for one-half, or even less, the salary which men would ask.” Although Stone’s salary increased along with the size of her schools, until she finally received $16 a month, it was always lower than the male rate.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{prior to}} 1894 Eberhardt began {{corresponding}} with Eugène Letord, a French officer {{stationed in the}} Sahara who had placed a newspaper advertisement for a pen pal. Eberhardt asked him for every detail he <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> {{about life in the}} Sahara, also informing him of her dreams of escaping Geneva alongside her favourite sibling, Augustin. Letord encouraged the two of them to relocate to Bône, Algeria, where he could assist them in establishing a new life. In a series of circumstances that remain unclear though involved financial debts and ties to Russian revolutionist groups with which he was affiliated, Augustin fled Geneva in 1894. Eberhardt probably assisted him initially but was unable to keep track of his whereabouts despite making constant inquiries. In November 1894 Eberhardt was informed by a letter that Augustin had joined the French Foreign Legion and was assigned to Algeria. While at first furious with Augustin's decision, Eberhardt's anger did not last; she asked him to send her a detailed diary of what he saw in North Africa.|$|E

25|$|For example, if José Santos Almeida and Maria Abreu Melo had a daughter, {{her name}} could simply be Joana Melo Almeida (given name + mother's last name + father's last name). However, they <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> two given names, for example Joana Gabriela, and combine their {{surnames}} in various ways, such has Joana Gabriela Melo Almeida, Joana Gabriela Abreu Melo Almeida (two surnames from the mother, {{one from the}} father), Joana Gabriela Abreu Santos Almeida (one name from the mother, two from the father), or even Joana Gabriela Abreu Melo Santos Almeida (two names from each parent). It would also be possible to use surnames that {{are not part of}} either parent's legal name, but which the parents would be entitled to use, i.e., a surname from a grandparent or a great-grandparent that was not transmitted to the father or the mother. This child would probably become known by her final surname, Joana Almeida. However, her parents could decide to change the order of surnames and name her Joana Almeida Melo, etc. In this case she would probably be known as Joana Melo.|$|E
500|$|Steam-powered screw frigates {{were built}} in the mid-1840s, {{and at the end of}} the decade the French Navy {{introduced}} steam power to its line of battle. The desire for change came from the ambition of Napoleon III to gain greater influence in Europe, which required a challenge to the British at sea. The first purpose-built steam battleship was the 90-gun [...] in 1850. [...] Napoléon was armed as a conventional ship-of-the-line, but her steam engines <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> a speed of 12 knots (22km/h), regardless of the wind conditions: a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement.|$|E

The song was written by Kesha alongside Lukasz [...] "Dr. Luke" [...] Gottwald, Benjamin Levin, Shondrae [...] "Bangladesh" [...] Crawford and Klas Åhlund, with production done by Bangladesh, Dr. Luke and Levin. While working on the album she {{enlisted the help of}} producer Bangladesh so that she <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> music a more distinct edge. Kesha uses a [...] "sing-rap" [...] vocal style throughout the song and uses layered vocals that are enhanced in some parts with the use of auto-tune. Lyrically the song speaks of wealthy men hitting on Kesha, trying to buy her attention.|$|E

"Batgirl: A Matter of Family", {{which was}} {{developed}} by WB Games Montréal, is an [...] "Arkham Episode" [...] featuring Barbara Gordon as Batgirl set before the events of Arkham Asylum. Set in the Seagate Amusement Park, a nautical theme park built atop an oil rig, Batgirl and Robin team up to save her father, Commissioner Gordon, from the Joker and Harley. The content carries over the Dual Play function and hacking ability, which allows Batgirl to take down enemies, control objects, and solve puzzles. Design producer Justin Vazquez said, [...] "Hacking is really what separates her from the other characters... Our intention was that Batgirl should be less powerful than Batman, but that Batgirl plus hacking <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> opportunities {{to do things that}} not even Batman can pull off."

500|$|The {{first major}} {{change to the}} ship of the line concept was the {{introduction}} of steam power as an auxiliary propulsion system. Steam power was gradually introduced to the navy {{in the first half}} of the 19th century, initially for small craft and later for frigates. The French Navy introduced steam to the line of battle with the 90-gun [...] in 1850—the first true steam battleship. Napoléon was armed as a conventional ship-of-the-line, but her steam engines <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> a speed of , regardless of the wind condition. This was a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement. The introduction of steam accelerated the growth in size of battleships. France and the United Kingdom were the only countries to develop fleets of wooden steam screw battleships although several other navies operated small numbers of screw battleships, including Russia (9), Turkey (3), Sweden (2), Naples (1), Denmark (1) and Austria (1). In addition, the Navy of the North Germany Confederacy (which included Prussia) bought [...] from Britain in 1870 for use as a gunnery training ship.|$|E
500|$|Cox {{left his}} job as an {{insurance}} agent {{to work as a}} mortgage broker for a local company. While there he developed a reputation for unscrupulousness, which was heightened by his authorship of an unpublished 317-page manuscript entitled The Associates. The novel's protagonist, who shares many traits in common with Cox, travels the country committing mortgage fraud. Cox told co-workers about the book, and elaborated its details to them. [...] "He sent it {{to a lot of people}} to see if they thought it worked" [...] said a former co-worker. After being fired from the company when he was convicted of mortgage fraud in 2002, Cox faked a good credit history, and used that to buy dozens of homes and properties. In one instance he used the social security number of a toddler, and all of his documents—references, bank letters, rent receipts, W-2s from nonexistent employees—were counterfeit. He used his skills as an artist to decorate the properties with elaborate art deco-style murals. Several of his future girlfriends said that his painting talents were part of his allure, though the St. Petersburg Times described his works as copies of murals by Tamara de Lempicka. Cox charmed Alison Arnold, a young local married woman, into believing he <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> a wealthy and luxurious life. While courting Arnold she said he took her to crime films such as The Italian Job and Catch Me if You Can—which he reportedly adored and watched several times—and detailed his criminal plans to her.|$|E

2500|$|Strang's {{defense of}} {{polygamy}} was rather woman-centered. He claimed {{that far from}} enslaving or demeaning women, it liberated and [...] "elevated" [...] them {{by allowing them to}} choose the best possible mate based upon any factors deemed important to them—even if that mate were already married to someone else. Rather than being forced to wed [...] "corrupt and degraded sires" [...] due to the scarcity of more suitable men, a woman could wed the one she saw as the most compatible to herself, the best candidate to father her children and the man who <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> the best possible life, no matter how many other wives he might have.|$|E

Carly and Jake's sex scenes were later removed from the Sunday omnibus edition. The showdown of Rob, Dawn and May's storyline where May stated to Dawn she <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> an elective caesarean (Dawn being handcuffed to the bed) prompted 200 complaints.

2500|$|According to Sunnis, Muhammad didn't gift Fadak to his daughter. All the narrations {{regarding}} this are weak. As {{far as the}} claim of Shias is concerned, that when the verse of Holy Quran, [...] "And give the relative his right", was revealed, the Prophet gave Fadak to his daughter, then this argument is weak. First of all, this narration is weak because of the narrator Atiyah al-Awfi. Secondly, this verse was revealed in Makkah, and Fadak was conquered when Muslims were in Madinah. It is not possible that the verse regarding Fadak was revealed {{at a time when}} Fadak was not {{in the hands of the}} Muslims. This is not the case of the applicability of a law, it is an issue of the invalidity of a gift before it comes in the hands of a person. Moreover, Muhammad did not gave worldly things to his daughter. He even refused to give her a maid, hence it is not possible that he <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> a huge piece of land.|$|E
