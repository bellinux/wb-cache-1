40|$|To {{evaluate}} the anti-inflammatory effects of different dietary oils on ovalbumin-sensitized and -challenged mice. Experimental BALB/c mice were fed with different diets containing 5 % corn oil [rich in linoleic acid, 18 : 2 n- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), {{as a control}} diet], 5 % perilla oil (rich in alpha-linolenic acid, 18 : 3 n- 3 PUFA) or 5 % <b>compound</b> <b>oil</b> containing 50 % corn oil and 50 % perilla oil, for 5 consecutive weeks. The leukocyte count, inflammatory mediators, and cytokine levels, including proinflammatory and Th 1 /Th 2 cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from the mice were determined. The results showed that 5 % <b>compound</b> <b>oil</b> administration significantly (P 0. 05) decrease the eosinophil accumulation or the secretions of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), histamine, nitric oxide and eotaxin. However, dietary perilla oil significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-alpha, IL- 1 beta and IL- 6) and Th 1 cytokine (IFN-gamma and IL- 2) production. The production of Th 2 cytokine IL- 10, but not IL- 4 and IL- 5, was also significantly inhibited by perilla oil administration. The results suggest that dietary perilla oil might alleviate inflammation via decreasing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in BALF, but failed to regulate the Th 1 /Th 2 balance toward Th 1 pole during the Th 2 -skewed allergic airway inflammation...|$|E

The effect of the non-ionic dispersing agent polysorbate 80 (P 80) on the liquid crystalline organization of the nanocarriers and their stability was studied {{in the context of}} vesicle-to-cubosome transition. The coexistence of small vesicular and nanosponge membrane objects with bigger nanoparticles with inner multicompartment cubic lattice structures was established as a typical feature of the employed dispersion process. The cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) images and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) structural analyses revealed the dependence of the internal organization of the self-assembled nanoparticles on the presence of embedded βCD-nC 10 deep cavitands in the lipid bilayers. The obtained results indicated that the incorporated amphiphilic βCD-nC 10 building blocks stabilize the cubic lattice packing in the lipid membrane particles, which displayed structural features beyond the traditional CD nanosponges.

40|$|Our {{previous}} studies indicated that alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) -rich perilla oil might alleviate bronchoalveolar inflammation. However, {{it failed to}} modulate the Th 1 /Th 2 balance toward the Th 1 pole during Th 2 -skewed allergic airway inflammation in mice. This study attempts to further investigate the effects of dietary perilla oil on serum lipids and immunoglobulin profiles using an ovalbumin (OVA) -challenged mouse model. The inbred female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into four groups and fed different AlN- 76 feeds containing 5 % com oil (rich in linoleic acid. 18 : 2 n- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), as a control diet), 5 % perilla oil (rich in alpha-linolenic acid, 18 : 3 n- 3 PUFA) or 5 % <b>compound</b> <b>oil</b> containing 50 % corn oil and 50 % perilla oil, respectively, for 35 consecutive days ad libitum. Experimental mice were sensitized by an intraperitoneal injection of alum-precipitated antigen containing ovalbumin on 7, 14 and 21 days after supply of the specified experimental diets. One week later, the mice were then challenged by aerosolized OVA. The results showed that dietary perilla oil administration significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased the relative liver tissue weight (RTW) and serum lipid levels including triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol. However, the HDL/LDL ratio was also significantly lowered by dietary perilla oil. Dietary perilla oil markedly decreased serum OVA-specific IgG 1 level and total IgA antibodies (Th 2 antibodies). Unfortunately, it also increased non-specific serum IgE (Th 2 antibody) levels. The results suggest that dietary perilla oil might have a moderately beneficial effect on asthmatic allergy via lowering serum lipids and OVA-specific IgG 1, as well as total IgA levels. However, it failed to obviously modulate Th 1 /Th 2 antibody levels via isotype switching of B cells from Th 2 antibody to Th 1 antibody. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

In: Journal of Applied Microbiology, 103, (6), pp 2132 - 2141 Aims: To investigate the mode of action of {{a blend of}} essential <b>oil</b> <b>compounds</b> on the colonization of starch-rich substrates by rumen bacteria. Methods and Results: Starch-rich substrates were incubated, in nylon bags, in the rumen of sheep organized in a 4 ? 4 latin square design and receiving a 60 : 40 silage : concentrate diet. The concentrate was either high or low in crude protein, and the diet was supplemented or not with a commercial blend of essential <b>oil</b> <b>compounds</b> (110 mg per day). The total genomic DNA was extracted from the residues in the bags.
