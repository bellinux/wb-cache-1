It argues that these neighbourhoods have no urban life and have fallen into a state of obsolescence, and {{analyses}} how far the design of their public realm is responsible for this lack of urban life, proposing urban design strategies to transform the urban space of these neighbourhoods into a realm for social interaction and public activities. The analysis focuses on two case studies located in London: Loughborough Estate in Brixton, London Borough of Lambeth, and Gascoyne Estate in Hackney. Both are post-war housing estates designed and built in the 1950 s by London County Council. For the urban design strategy proposals, it follows Richard Sennett's approach that cities need "certain kinds of disorder" for people to learn how to tolerate difference and to accept uncertainty. Sennett argues that there is too much order in modernist urban design, which stifles spontaneity and creates alienating public space. This thesis reworks this idea, applying it to the current situation of British housing estates, which are still in need of spaces for improvisation after decades of decay, urban transformations, and socio-economic changes. Revisiting Sennett's work, it finds affinities between his more recent work {{and the way in which}} 'assemblage' thinking has been used in critical urbanism. Accordingly, the thesis uses 'assemblage' as a concept to explain how to introduce Sennett's notions of disorder into urban design strategies and bring life to the obsolete public spaces of council estates. Building on Sennett's 'uses of disorder' and using 'assemblage' as a tool to apply this to the design of public space, the thesis proposes the term 'infrastructures for disorder': urban design interventions in the public space of social housing neighbourhoods to create conditions for the spontaneous use of the public space and encourage social interaction. The infrastructures for disorder present two kinds of contribution: a contribution to critical urban theory and a contribution to architecture and urban design. Using 'assemblage' - with its <b>connotations</b> <b>of</b> <b>process,</b> emergence and uncertainty - to implement Sennett's uses of disorder leads to the use of the term 'infrastructure' to describe how the proposed strategies aim to be the beginning of a process, creating initial conditions. In addition, the infrastructures for disorder provide a contribution to architecture and urban design, proposing urban design guidelines using terms commonly used by architects and urban designers: 'surface', 'section' and 'process'. The surface and section strategies propose a physical reconfiguration of the public realm through a series of small changes addressing the problems of the public space described in the first part of the thesis. The process strategies serve as a method to implement the surface and section strategies, placing special emphasis on the need for constant upgrades of the public space of these neighbourhoods. Through these contributions, the thesis offers agents an alternative approach to intervention in the public space of social housing neighbourhoods. The implementation of such contributions must take into account that they are flexible guidelines that need to be adapted to different contexts. Esta tesis versa sobre el diseño del espacio público de las barriadas de viviendas sociales de post-guerra en Reino Unido. Estas barriadas carecen de vida urbana y han caído en un estado de obsolescencia. La tesis analiza la influencia del diseño del espacio público en esta falta de vida urbana y propone estrategias de diseño urbano que tengan la capacidad de transformar el espacio urbano de estas barriadas en un lugar de interacción social y actividades en público. El análisis se centra en dos casos de estudio localizados en Londres: Loughborough Estate, Brixton, en el municipio de Lambeth, y Gascoyne Estate en el municipio de Hackney. Ambas son barriadas de postguerra proyectadas y construidas en la década de 1950 por el London County Council. Las estrategias de diseño urbano propuestas toman como punto de partida la postura de Richard Sennett: las ciudades necesitan “ciertos tipos de desorden” para que las personas aprendan a tolerar lo diferente y a aceptar la incertidumbre. Sennett argumenta que el diseño urbano moderno se concibió desde el orden, lo cual no permite la espontaneidad y ha construido un espacio público alienante. La tesis revisa esta idea y la traslada a la situación actual de los polígonos de vivienda británicos, los cuales, después de décadas de abandono, transformaciones urbanas y cambios socio-económicos, todavía carecen de espacios para la improvisación. A través de la revisión del trabajo de Sennett, la tesis identifica afinidades entre su obra más reciente y el uso del concepto assemblage (ensamblaje, asociación, agenciamiento) en la teoría del urbanismo crítico. A partir de este hallazgo, la tesis usa el término assemblage como instrumento para aplicar la idea de desorden de Sennett a estrategias de diseño urbano que revitalicen el espacio público obsoleto de las barriadas en cuestión...|$|E

40|$|Our {{paper will}} {{describe}} the creative <b>process</b> <b>of</b> Zaum: Beyond Mind an interactive sound theater performance, {{and examine the}} role of improvisation in shaping the piece. Zaum is a modular performance for voice, bandoneon, piano and electronics- integrating both live interactive elements and fixed sounds – with lighting, and video projection. While the creative process included traditional modes of composition, a significant aspect in melding the contribution of two composers - each with {{a different approach to}} composition - shares important attributes with improvisation. It is to do with creative listening, adjusting our individual contribution in response to changing contexts, and developing a shared sense of musical pacing and narrative. Improvisation also {{played a significant role in}} developing the technological, interactive elements of the piece with a co-evolution of the programming and the performance over a lengthy <b>process</b> <b>of</b> exploration and adjustments. This process, therefore, entails multiple dialogues, musical as well as verbal, between us as a duo and between us and our instruments. On the way we discovered that analytical reflection, despite its <b>connotations</b> <b>of</b> cerebral <b>processes</b> popularly portrayed as in opposition to the spontaneity required in improvisation, played a crucial role in the shaping of the piece...|$|R

The modification generated an inorganic coating around the fibers, associated {{with the construction of}} a three-dimensional network of Si-O-Si bridges partly bound to the polysaccharide macromolecules.

40|$|The present paper {{analyses}} recent Romanian {{accounts of}} women's uprooting from a communist regime, foregrounding manners {{in which the}} migrants' transnational itineraries are punctuated by instances of groundedness that temporary anchor the protagonists in their translocal settings. More specifically, the article discusses the segmented itineraries of women migrants from Romania via different European countries to their final destination, the United States. I have chosen the syntagm "accounts of uprooting" instead of "migration literature", as the primary corpus of this analysis {{is made up of}} different literary genres: a novel, Train to Trieste by Domnica Radulescu and a memoir, The Gypsy Saw Two Lives, by Rodica Mihalis. The analysis of these creations introduces a comparative perspective on the shaping of translocal perceptions in the context of transnational migration. Consequently, the body of the paper investigates the migrant characters' relation to the European spaces where they settle before preparing their relocation to the USA. By adopting this approach, the discussion blends the axes of embeddedness and disembeddedness in order to provide a more comprehensive account of the intersections between gender and migration placed in a transnational context. Therefore, the discussion considers both the transgressive, fluid <b>connotations</b> <b>of</b> transnational <b>processes</b> and the individuals' need for stable structures despite their discontinuous itineraries...|$|R

My intention was to think and consequently write about {{the past and present}} of legal protection of computer programs of all sorts, aiming especially on czech status quo of this protection. The main source of rules was and still is the czech Author Act, but I've also tried to analyze other, mainly european, laws. Together with history of a computer program my goal was to put before-mentioned into a broader context. At the beginning of the thesis, after the explanatory and historical part, in the chapter about the subject matter of author law, the computer program, I'm trying to delimitate the differences between source and object code. In the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> writing this thesis, I've tried to summarize the relevant means of use, especially the action of installing a program, legal means and <b>connotations</b> <b>of</b> this <b>process.</b> Also I wrote about distribution of a computer program regarding author rights. Consequently I'm briefly analyzing the relatively fresh decision of Court of Justice of the European Union, which is about protection of a graphical user interface of a computer program. In the two final chapters I'm describing the issues in licensing of software and various available legal actions to [...] ...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 235 - 249. This dissertation {{deals with}} the question how modern domesticity and modern femininity were discursively constructed in the advertisements and other promotional texts of electric appliances published between 1923 and 1950 in popular women’s and family magazines in Turkey. The issue is framed within socio-historical technology studies and the feminist histories of the early republican period. Moving forward from the claim that electricity had to be first domesticated to enter the homes, the study searches for the gendered <b>connotations</b> <b>of</b> this <b>process.</b> Besides, it ponders over the ways women are interpellated as modern subjects by the representations in question. To this end the dissertation carries on a discourse analysis of the visual and textual representations of electricity and electric powered domestic appliances. The images are discussed in their potential to bring forth the ambiguities in the definitions of modern domesticity and femininity. Analysis revealed that neither the middle-class ethos of domesticity nor the chaste woman of this family was the only idealized form of domesticity and femininity by the official discourses. There were rather different modernities defined distinctly based on various class positions {{all of which were}} approved by the republican cadres. Şavk, Bahar EmginPh. D...|$|R
