5|$|Apart {{from a few}} {{inscriptions}} and fragments, texts {{written by}} people who actually knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander were all lost. Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexander's campaign historian Callisthenes; Alexander's generals Ptolemy and Nearchus; Aristobulus, a junior officer on the campaigns; and Onesicritus, Alexander's chief helmsman. Their works are lost, but later works based on these original sources have survived. The earliest of these is Diodorus Siculus (1st <b>century</b> BC), followed by Quintus Curtius Rufus (mid-to-late 1st <b>century</b> AD), Arrian (1st to 2nd <b>century</b> AD), the biographer Plutarch (1st to 2nd <b>century</b> AD), and finally Justin, whose work dated {{as late as the}} 4th <b>century.</b> Of these, Arrian is generally considered the most reliable, given that he used Ptolemy and Aristobulus as his sources, closely followed by Diodorus.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{in modern}} Scotland {{encompasses}} all building in Scotland, between {{the beginning of}} the twentieth <b>century</b> and the present day. The most significant architect of the early twentieth <b>century</b> was Charles Rennie Mackintosh, who mixed elements of traditional Scottish architecture with contemporary movements. Estate house design declined in importance in the twentieth <b>century.</b> In the early decades of the <b>century,</b> traditional materials began to give way to cheaper modern ones. After the First World War modernism and the office block began to dominate building in the major cities and attempts began to improve the quality of urban housing for the poor, resulted in a massive programme of council house building. The Neo-Gothic style continued in to the twentieth <b>century</b> but the most common forms in this period were plain and massive Neo-Romanesque buildings.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, more recent work has {{suggested}} that the regular army of the 2nd <b>century</b> was considerably larger than the c. 300,000 traditionally assumed. This is because the 2nd-century auxilia were not just equal in numbers to the legions as in the early 1st <b>century,</b> but some 50% larger. The army of the Principate probably reached a peak of nearly 450,000 (excluding fleets and foederati) {{at the end of the}} 2nd <b>century.</b> Furthermore, the evidence is that the actual strength of 2nd-century units was typically much closer to official (c. 85%) than 4th <b>century</b> units.|$|E
