40|$|Results of {{previous}} work suggest a preference of adult observers for <b>cute</b> compared to less <b>cute</b> infants. In Study 1 we investigated whether {{the preference for}} <b>cute</b> infants depends on the ethnicity and species of the infant. We simultaneously presented two faces (one <b>cute</b> and one less <b>cute)</b> and asked Caucasian participants to choose the infant to whom they would rather give a toy (Task 1) and which infant they would rather adopt (Task 2). The infants were Caucasian or African human babies or dog puppies. For all face categories and in both tasks we found a strong preference for <b>cute</b> infants. A possible reason for preferring <b>cute</b> infants may be that <b>cute</b> infants look healthier than less <b>cute</b> infants. To investigate whether cuteness {{is associated with the}} assessment of health we conducted Study 2. Faces of Caucasian and African infants and dog puppies were rated for cuteness and health. The findings revealed a significant relationship between health and cuteness evaluation across all stimuli. We suggest that one reason why <b>cute</b> infants are preferred might be because they are perceived as being healthier...|$|R

It is a group singing, in unison, where the form is an alternation between a solo singer and the whole group. There were no musical instruments involved in Indung singing. Within the Indung songs, there are many lullabies. On the other hand, there are also a few songs that are sung with dance movements.|$|E

40|$|Wounding {{of plants}} is a {{widespread}} stress in nature. Physical damage frequently occurs during harvesting, handling and marketing of fresh produce. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is a key enzyme involved in plant wound related phenylpropanoid metabolism while heat shock proteins (HSPs) are involved in abiotic, including wounding, and biotic stress responses in plants. However, {{little is known about}} postharvest expression at gene and protein levels of PAL and HSPs in wounding (fresh-cut) fruits. In the present study, expression patterns of PAL and HSPs in fresh-cut and intact banana fruit pulp were characterized by Northern and Western blot analyses. <b>Cuting</b> enhanced Ma-PAL 2 mRNA accumulation, new PAL protein synthesis, and PAL activity; thereby resulting in accumulation of total phenolics. HSP 70 protein and Ma-HSP 70 - 2 transcript were constitutively expressed and were not affected by cutting. However, Ma-HSP 70 - 1 transcript levels increased in fresh-cut pulp tissue at 2 – 18 h after cutting. Ma-sHSP- 1 -CI, Ma-sHSP- 3 -CII, Ma-HSP 90, and Ma-HSP 101 transcripts also accumulated in fresh-cut tissues at 2 – 18 h after <b>cuting,</b> but Ma-sHSP- 2 -CI did not accumulate. Accumulation of sHSP (HSP 17. 6), HSP 90 and HSP 101 proteins exhibited the same pattern of expression as their mRNA. There was no evidence of a possible suppressive effect of HSPs synthesis on PAL protein accumulation. Thus, PAL, sHSP, HSP 90 and HSP 101 were regulated by cutting both at translational and transcriptional levels while HSP 70 (Ma-HSP 70 - 1) was regulated by cutting only at transcription level...|$|E

Technical science defines {{a lot of different}} factors, that they may be cause of shorter life-time of cutting tool. Maximally possible elimination of these factors is necessary for optimization of cutting materials life-time. Durability of cutting materials is defined in standard ISO 3685. The main part of standard ISO 3685 is T-vc dependence definition for selected cutting materials. One of these <b>cuting</b> materials contained in this standard is cutting ceramic. Standard ISO 3685 contains instructions how to create T-vc dependence for cutting tools made of cutting ceramic.

40|$|Abstract This {{paper will}} discuss about CNC turning {{machining}} process. One {{of the way}} to increase productivity in CNC machining process is by tooling process sequencing in processing workpiece feature. Tool sequencing in CNC turning machining process can be made by comparing tool sequencing process model 1 (turning 3. SD 1) with tool sequence process model 2 (turning 1. SD 1), these activity is needed to measure the distance effect from workpiece cutting process with tool in z axis. Comparison between model 1 and model 2 can be a guidance to achieve the optimum processing time. This paper is expected could explain how to increase processing time productivity by feeding tool sequence for cutting process. Another advantage from feeding tool sequence is the short <b>cuting</b> time that directly decrease maximum cutting (Flmax) and also unproper NC machining program.

40|$|Background. The {{evaluation}} of neonatal outcome after delivery is being performed since 1953 by Apgar score. Since {{some parts of}} this scoring system subject to personal judgment of the evaluator, the researchers attempts are to introduce more objective method of determining neonatal outcome after delivery. Determining umbilical artery pH value is one of such attempts. Methods. We established umbilical artery blood pH value in 146 newborns after <b>cuting</b> umbilical cord following delivery. The same newborns were evaluated by Apgar score. By analysis of the variance both evaluating methods of neonatal outcome were compared regarding their ability to predict neonatal indisposition for duration of hospitalization. Neonatal morbidity and neonatal hospitalization duration were the criteria for neonatal indisposition. Results. Apgar score value following 5 th minute after delivery is importantly linked with neonatal morbidity and neonatal hospitalization duration. Conclusion. Umbilical artery blood pH value can’t {{be used as a}} substitute to Apgar score. Apgar score after 5 th minute is the sole predictor of neonatal outcome. </p...|$|E
