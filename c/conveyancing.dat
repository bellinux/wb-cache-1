The Moorefield and Virginia Railroad Company assumed the $700,000 mortgage against the rail line. Cornwell and Eugene Ailes, the son-in-law of his brother John Jacob, served as officers of the <b>conveyancing</b> company for the transaction. The Moorefield and Virginia Railroad Company subsequently transferred the rail line to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company in November 1913.|$|E

5|$|Smuts's time at Cambridge {{had been}} one of {{outstanding}} success; his tutor Professor FW Maitland, himself one of the most eminent legal minds of the time, described Smuts as the most brilliant Law student he had ever taught. With testimonials such as this, in summer 1894 Smuts was able to persuade the Ebden trustees to award him £100 for a further year's study. After a short holiday in Strasbourg, spent studying English <b>conveyancing</b> and German philosophy, Smuts returned to England. For a short time he contemplated moving to the Netherlands to seek a Dutch degree, but by October 1894 he had instead decided to read for the Bar. In December 1894 he passed the Honours Examination of the Inns of Court, passing first in his year. Smuts was called to the Middle Temple and soon received an offer of a fellowship in Law from his old college, Christ's. The possibility of a distinguished legal career in England, whether in practice or in academia, now lay before him. Instead, he rejected both paths; in June 1895, as his Ebden funding came to an end, the homesick Smuts returned to the Cape, determined to make his future there.|$|E

25|$|Section 34 {{establishes}} the Authorised <b>Conveyancing</b> Practitioners Board as a statutory corporation. The Practitioners Board is tasked with developing competition in <b>conveyancing</b> services to avoid monopolies, supervising {{the actions of}} licensed conveyancers and developing a way of monitoring said conveyancers. The Practitioners Board has the powers to both grant and refuse authorisation to <b>conveyancing</b> practitioners, establish a <b>conveyancing</b> ombudsman and a compensation scheme for parties that suffer {{as a result of}} a conveyancer's actions appoint investigators to look into the behaviour of an authorised conveyancer.

Before 1983, only solicitors had been {{authorised}} to take part in <b>conveyancing</b> work—for anyone else to draft documents relating to the transfer of property was a statutory offence. In December 1983 Austin Mitchell, a Labour Member of Parliament who {{had been one of the}} initial supporters of Alf Dubs' private member's bill introduced a private member's bill of his own called the House Buyers Bill. This aimed to remove the restrictions on <b>conveyancing,</b> and although the government opposed it they made it clear that they planned to allow banks and building societies to carry out <b>conveyancing</b> for their customers, and would also be prepared to allow non-solicitors with suitable qualifications to carry out <b>conveyancing</b> work as well.|$|E

The draft code of conduct had several flaws, however—it allowed practitioners to act for both parties in a transaction, causing issues with conflicts of interest, and failed {{to take into account the}} problems caused by banks and estate agents, who had interests in the housing market, being allowed to act as conveyancers.|$|E

25|$|After {{negotiations}} with the government, Mitchell withdrew his bill {{in exchange for a}} guarantee that the government would allow non-solicitors to undertake <b>conveyancing</b> work once a Committee had set out proposals for protecting consumers who used these new conveyancers against losses. The Committee, known as the Farrand Committee (after its chairman, Julian Farrand), finished its report in September 1984. The government almost immediately changed the rules to allow for licensed conveyancers, introducing the changes with a section in the Administration of Justice Act 1985. Despite worries that this would bankrupt solicitors who specialised in <b>conveyancing</b> work, very few licensed conveyancers began practising due to the difficulties in qualifying, and although the field has become more competitive there has been no substantial loss of revenue like that feared.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the monitored {{data of the}} 4 times of stream water <b>conveyances</b> to the river section where the stream flow was cut-off, of 9 groundwater-monitoring sections and 18 vegetation plots in the lower reaches of Tarim River. The {{results show that the}} groundwater depth in the lower reaches of Tarim River rose from, 9. 87 m before the <b>conveyances</b> to 7. 74 m and 3. 79 m after the first and second <b>conveyances,</b> 3. 61 and 3. 16 m after the 2 phases of the third <b>conveyance,</b> and 2. 66 m after the fourth <b>conveyance.</b> The transverse response scope of groundwater level was gradually enlarged along both sides of the channel of <b>conveyances,</b> i. e., from 450 m in width after the first <b>conveyance</b> to 1050 m after the fourth <b>conveyance,</b> but the response degree of groundwater level was reduced With the increase of the distance away from the channel of <b>conveyances.</b> The composition, distribution and growth status of the natural vegetation are directly related to the groundwater depth. The indexes of Simpson's biodiversity, McIntosh's evenness and Margalef's richness, which reflect the change of the quantity of species and the degree of biodiversity, are reduced from 0. 70, 0. 48 and 0. 90 to 0. 26, 0. 17 and 0. 37 respectively along with the drawdown of groundwater level from the upper reaches to the lower reaches. After the stream water <b>conveyances,</b> the natural vegetation in the lower reaches is saved and restored along with the rise of groundwater level, the response scope of vegetation is gradually enlarged, i. e., from 200 - 250 m in width after the first <b>conveyance</b> to 800 m after the fourth <b>conveyance.</b> However, there is still a great disparity to the objective of protecting the "Green Corridor" in the lower reaches of Tarim River. Thus, it is suggested to convey the stream water in double-channel way, combine the <b>conveyance</b> with water supply in surface scope, or construct the modern pipe-conveyance network systems so as to save the natural vegetation in an intensive way, achieve the efficient water consumption and speed up the restoration and regeneration of the damaged ecosystems in the lower reaches of Tarim River...|$|R
