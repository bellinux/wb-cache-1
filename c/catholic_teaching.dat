5|$|According to <b>Catholic</b> <b>teaching,</b> this commandment {{does not}} {{preclude}} the use of God's name in taking solemn oaths administered by legitimate authority. However, lying under oath, invoking God's name for magical purposes, or voicing words of hatred or defiance against God are considered sins of blasphemy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Catholic</b> <b>teaching</b> {{regarding}} sexuality {{calls for}} a practice of chastity, {{with a focus on}} maintaining the spiritual and bodily integrity of the human person. Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity. Church teachings about sexuality have become an issue of increasing controversy, especially after the close of the Second Vatican Council, due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world described as the sexual revolution.|$|E
50|$|I {{might say}} that my {{question}} to their Lordships was: Is this contrary to <b>Catholic</b> moral <b>teaching?</b> The reply, as you all know, was that it is contrary to <b>Catholic</b> social <b>teaching.</b> I was not aware — the Taoiseach can verify this — until I had asked {{each member of the}} Cabinet separately what he proposed to do, what he had been given to understand by Dr. McQuaid when that decision was taken. He then told us that that morning he had been informed by Dr. McQuaid that <b>Catholic</b> social <b>teaching</b> and <b>Catholic</b> moral <b>teaching</b> were one and the same thing.|$|R
40|$|International {{relations}} have changed dramatically since the Second Vatican Council, {{yet there are}} remarkable continuities in <b>Catholic</b> social <b>teaching</b> and its approach to global development. It accords importance to culture and religion vis [...] vis the Church's conception of integral human development. Several of {{the basic principles of}} <b>Catholic</b> social <b>teaching</b> are related to the main problems of developing countries, so <b>Catholic</b> social <b>teaching</b> can inform how the development community views culture and religion. Viewing the principles of <b>Catholic</b> social <b>teaching</b> through the lens of Alasdair MacIntyre's social theory helps us to constructively apply those principles to global development policy today...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, greater {{attention}} has been paid to the influence of <b>Catholic</b> social <b>teaching</b> as a contributor to legal debates in American society. As it has developed, <b>Catholic</b> social <b>teaching</b> clearly envisions a role for the Church to play in shaping society. The interplay between <b>Catholic</b> social <b>teaching</b> and American law is a fascinating, complex, and, at times, tense relationship. That relationship is the subject of these observations and reflections. The first part of this discussion explores how leading Church documents define the proper scope of influence for <b>Catholic</b> social <b>teaching.</b> After this brief background, the discussion will turn to reflection on the impact that <b>Catholic</b> social <b>teaching</b> has had on American law and politics. It will then explore in more depth three obstacles that have been barriers to a greater role for Catholic social thought in American legal and political discourse...|$|R
5|$|In 1548 Charles {{declared}} an interreligio imperialis (also {{known as the}} Augsburg Interim) through which he sought to find some common ground for religious peace. This effort alienated both Protestant and Catholic princes and the papacy; even Charles, whose decree it was, was unhappy with the political and diplomatic dimensions of what amounted to half of a religious settlement. The 1551–52 sessions convened by Pope Julius III at the supposedly ecumenical Council of Trent solved none of the larger religious issues but simply restated <b>Catholic</b> <b>teaching</b> and condemned Protestant teaching as heresies.|$|E
5|$|In {{seeking to}} {{discipline}} the nuns, the Vatican did not contact {{any one of}} them personally, and did not respond to direct individual communication. Rather, the superiors of the nuns were asked to write letters verifying whether or not the nuns were in line with <b>Catholic</b> <b>teaching</b> on abortion, and a variety of responses were received from the superiors. A few nuns disavowed their position on abortion and the cases were quickly closed. Most nuns held to their earlier conviction, although their superiors sent letters saying that they accepted Church teaching. Once a nun's superior had {{sent a letter to the}} Vatican, the case was closed, without any further attempt to prevent the nun from speaking out on the issues.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 16th century, the Catholic Church {{had been}} the sole {{official}} Christian faith in the Holy Roman Empire. Martin Luther's initial agenda called for the reform of the Church's doctrines and practices, but after his excommunication from the Church his ideas became embodied in an altogether separate religious movement, Lutheranism. Initially dismissed by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V as an inconsequential argument between monks, {{the idea of a}} reformation of the Church's doctrines, considered infallible and sacrosanct by <b>Catholic</b> <b>teaching,</b> accentuated controversy and competition in many of the territories of the Holy Roman Empire and quickly devolved into armed factions that exacerbated existing social, political and territorial grievances. These tensions were embodied in such alliances as the Protestant Schmalkaldic League, through which many of the Lutheran princes agreed to protect each other from encroachment on their territories and local authority; in retaliation, the princes that remained loyal to the Catholic Church formed the defensive Holy League. By the mid-1530s, the German-speaking states of the Holy Roman Empire had devolved into armed factions determined by family ties, geographic needs, religious loyalties, and dynastic aspirations. The religious issue both accentuated and masked these secular conflicts.|$|E

Some cite the alleged ordination of Ludmila Javorová in Communist Czechoslovakia in 1970 by Bishop Felix Davídek (1921–88), himself clandestinely consecrated due to the shortage of priests caused by state persecution, as precedent. The Catholic Church treats attempted ordinations of women as invalid, and automatically excommunicates all participants.|$|E
