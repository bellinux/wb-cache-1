40|$|Hardly {{anything}} {{seems to}} be as confusing as interpreting ISO/IEC 17025 compliance for complex electronic test equipment (M&TE). The difficulty of the measurement uncertainty analysis for modern M&TE adds an additional impediment {{to the task of}} comparing the manufacturer's specifications to evaluation of available <b>calibration</b> <b>services.</b> This is essential to meeting the "Challenge of Measurement Interoperability. " Calculating measurement uncertainties for a single parameter such as DC voltage is relatively straight forward, but to do so for a complex microwave spectrum analyzer that relies on digital signal processing is another matter. Accreditation was originally intended to provide a common denominator to compare quality of <b>calibration</b> <b>services</b> between one laboratory and another. Yet, the implementation of accreditation prevents a simple yes or no answer to the question: "does the instrument meet manufacturer's specifications? " Rather, the purchaser of accredited <b>calibration</b> <b>services</b> must evaluate a laboratory's scope of accreditation against the manufacturer's product specifications, which is not a simple matter for some derived parameters. This paper will explore the ways in which one equipment manufacturer, Agilent Technologies, is approaching in pragmatic and cos...|$|R

5000|$|Operator fatigue is an often-overlooked but crucial {{component}} when seeking maximal {{accuracy and}} repeatability. Repetitive motions cause stress in human joints and muscles. Even a well-trained and experienced operator {{will see a}} decrease in accuracy and repeatability as length {{of time on the}} job increases. It {{is for this reason that}} pipette <b>calibration</b> <b>service</b> providers that are dedicated to excellence limit the number of pipettes that can be calibrated by an individual technician to a maximum daily number. Each pipette, and each customer, deserves a high level of care in the treatment of the instrument. Additionally, some dedicated professionals train themselves to pipette ambidextrously, allowing them to reduce arm and finger strain by alternating hands. Another solution is choosing an electronic pipettor that significantly reduces hand fatigue. Once the operating button is touched the pipettor operates always the same way producing user independent accuracy and precision.|$|E

The major improvement in this calibration is the increased efficiency {{made possible by the}} consolidation of three disparate <b>calibration</b> <b>services</b> – low voltage thermal transfer standards, low-frequency thermal converters, and RF-dc difference calibrations – into a single service. This consolidation has the immediate benefit of offering NIST calibration customers one source for ac-dc calibrations from 2 mV to 1000 V and from 10 Hz to 1 GHz. Additional benefits include lower calibration prices and reduced uncertainties at many points...|$|R
40|$|The {{complex of}} the means of {{providing}} time and frequency traceability in the USSR includes the system of time and frequency standards of the National Time and Frequency <b>Calibration</b> <b>Service,</b> time and frequency transfer facilities and local time and frequency standards. Control on measurement correctness is performed by the All-Union State Standard <b>calibration</b> <b>service.</b> The hardware of most of the above-mentioned systems is provided by the instruments developed by our institute. A common scientific and technological approach allowed us to create a unified system of time-frequency equipment composed of widely used serial instruments, sets, automated systems and complexes. Primary frequency standards of different classes, time and frequency references and instruments are based on the unified system. CH 1 - 70 hydrogen frequency standard and its CH 1 - 70 A, CH 1 - 80 modifications are used in the group time and frequency standards. Measuring time and data processing techniques, and also instrumentation specifications on the results of 10 -year operation are given. The existing system provides time-frequency measurements with 2 times 10 (exp - 13) plus or minus 1 times 10 (exp - 14) accuracy...|$|E
