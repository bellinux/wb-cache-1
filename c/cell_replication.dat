25|$|Viral {{replication}} is cytoplasmic. Entry {{into the}} host cell {{is achieved by}} virus attachment to host <b>cell.</b> <b>Replication</b> follows the negative stranded RNA virus replication model. Negative stranded RNA virus transcription, using polymerase stuttering is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by leaky scanning, ribosomal shunting, and RNA termination-reinitiation. The virus exits the host cell by budding.|$|E
25|$|Some {{drugs are}} {{specifically}} directed against dividing cells. They {{can be used}} against tumors and viral diseases (both against retrovirus and against other virus), as the diseased cells replicate much more frequently than normal cells and also against some non-malignant diseases related to excessively rapid <b>cell</b> <b>replication</b> (for instance psoriasis). It {{has been suggested that}} the antiviral and anti-cancer activity of thymidine analogues is, at least partly, achieved by downregulation of mitochondrial thymidine kinase.|$|E
25|$|The lytic cycle, or {{productive}} infection, {{results in}} the production of infectious virions. EBV can undergo lytic replication in both B cells and epithelial cells. In B <b>cells,</b> lytic <b>replication</b> normally only takes place after reactivation from latency. In epithelial <b>cells,</b> lytic <b>replication</b> often directly follows viral entry.|$|R
40|$|The “rate-of-living theory” is {{an ancient}} {{explanation}} of longevity which holds that aging occurs due to the exhaustion of some finite substance—breaths, heartbeats, etc. While this theory as originally conceived has been debunked, new work (Ruzankina et al. [2007], {{in this issue of}} Cell Stem Cell) suggests that mammals in fact do have a finite number of stem <b>cell</b> <b>replications</b> per life...|$|R
50|$|Next, a virus {{must take}} control of the host <b>cell's</b> <b>replication</b> mechanisms. It is at this stage a {{distinction}} between susceptibility and permissibility of a host cell is made. Permissibility determines the outcome of the infection. After control is established and the environment is set for the virus to begin making copies of itself, replication occurs quickly by the millions.|$|R
25|$|A mega-{{telomere}} (also {{known as}} an ultra-long telomere or a class III telomere), is an extremely long telomere sequence that sits {{on the end of}} chromosomes and prevents the loss of genetic information during <b>cell</b> <b>replication.</b> Like regular telomeres, mega-telomeres are made of a repetitive sequence of DNA and associated proteins, and are located on the ends of chromosomes. However, mega-telomeres are substantially longer than regular telomeres, ranging in size from 50 kilobases to several megabases (for comparison, the normal length of vertebrate telomeres is usually between 10 and 20 kilobases).|$|E
25|$|A {{workshop}} on {{the limitations of}} size of microbes in 1999 found that though modern nanobacteria can't be smaller in volume than {{the interior of a}} sphere of diameter 250 ± 50nm, primitive microorganisms based on a single-polymer system could be. They cite the example of RNA based life, with ribozymes (catalytic RNA) taking the place of the much larger ribosomes as enzymes for <b>cell</b> <b>replication.</b> The cells also wouldn't have proteins and would have no need to translate DNA to mRNA. The result could be cells as small as a sphere 50nm in diameter. These RNA World cells are one of the suggestions made {{to bridge the gap between}} abiotic chemistry and modern cells.|$|E
25|$|Low {{molecular}} weight PAHs, with 2 to 4 aromatic hydrocarbon rings, are more potent as co-carcinogens during the promotional stage of cancer. In this stage, an initiated cell (i.e., a cell that has retained a carcinogenic mutation {{in a key}} gene related to <b>cell</b> <b>replication)</b> is removed from growth-suppressing signals from its neighboring cells and begins to clonally replicate. Low {{molecular weight}} PAHs that have bay or bay-like regions can dysregulate gap junction channels, interfering with intercellular communication, and also affect mitogen-activated protein kinases that activate transcription factors involved in cell proliferation. Closure of gap junction protein channels is a normal precursor to cell division. Excessive closure of these channels after exposure to PAHs results in removing a cell from the normal growth-regulating signals imposed by its local community of cells, thus allowing initiated cancerous cells to replicate. These PAHs {{do not need to}} be enzymatically metabolized first. Low molecular weight PAHs are prevalent in the environment, thus posing a significant risk to human health at the promotional phases of cancer.|$|E
25|$|In {{vertebrate}} <b>cells,</b> <b>replication</b> sites concentrate into positions called replication foci. Replication sites can {{be detected}} by immunostaining daughter strands and replication enzymes and monitoring GFP-tagged replication factors.

500|$|Scratching {{the site}} of the bite causes the trypomastigotes to enter the host through the wound, or through intact mucous membranes, such as the conjunctiva. Once inside the host, the trypomastigotes invade cells, where they {{differentiate}} into intracellular amastigotes. The amastigotes multiply by binary fission and differentiate into trypomastigotes, which are then released into the bloodstream. This cycle is repeated in each newly infected <b>cell.</b> <b>Replication</b> resumes only when the parasites enter another cell or are ingested by another vector. (See also: [...] ) ...|$|E

2500|$|Most {{chemotherapy}} drugs work {{by attacking}} fast-replicating cells. Rapid <b>cell</b> <b>replication</b> {{is one of}} the hallmarks of cancer; however, hair follicle cells also grow and divide quickly. Consequently, the chemotherapy drugs usually inhibit hair growth. [...] The dose and type of medicine determine the severity of hair loss, but once the chemotherapy has ended, new hair growth may begin after three to 10 months.|$|E
50|$|Viral {{genes are}} {{expressed}} {{through the use}} of the host <b>cell's</b> <b>replication</b> machinery; therefore, many viral genes have promoters that support binding of many transcription factors found naturally in the host cells. These transcription factors along with the virus' own proteins can repress or activate genes from both the virus and the host cell's genome. Many viruses can also increase the production of the cell's regulatory proteins.|$|R

2500|$|Since {{the field}} of {{genomics}} {{takes into account the}} entire genome of an organism and not simply its individual genes, the study [...] of latent viral infection falls into this realm.

2500|$|Concurrent {{with the}} {{development}} of the Cypher stent, Boston Scientific started development of the Taxus stent. [...] The Taxus stent was the Express2 metal stent, which was in general use for a number of years, with a copolymer coating of paclitaxel that inhibited <b>cell</b> <b>replication.</b> [...] As with the Cypher stent before it, the first trials of the Taxus stent revealed no evidence of in-stent restenosis at six months after the procedure, while later studies showed some restenosis, at a rate much lower than the bare metal counterpart. [...] Based on these trials, the Taxus stent was approved for use in Europe in 2003. [...] With further study, the FDA approved the use of the Taxus stent in the United States in March 2004.|$|E

Quasispecies models have also been proposed by Jose Fontanari and Emmanuel David Tannenbaum to model the evolution of sexual reproduction. Quasispecies was also shown in compositional replicators (based on the Gard model for abiogenesis) [...] and was also suggested to be applicable to describe <b>cell's</b> <b>replication,</b> which amongst other things requires the maintenance and evolution of the internal composition of the parent and bud.|$|R
40|$|In primary {{mammalian}} <b>cells,</b> DNA <b>replication</b> initiates in a {{small number}} of perinucleolar, lamin A/C-associated foci. During S-phase progression in proliferating <b>cells,</b> <b>replication</b> foci distribute to hundreds of sites throughout the nucleus. In contrast, we find that the limited perinucleolar replication sites persist throughout S phase as cells prepare to exit the cell cycle in response to contact inhibition, serum starvation, or replicative senescence. Proteins known to be involved in DNA synthesis, such as PCNA and DNA polymerase δ, are concentrated in perinucleolar foci throughout S phase under these conditions. Moreover, chromosomal loci are redirected toward the nucleolus and overlap with the perinucleolar <b>replication</b> foci in <b>cells</b> poised to undergo cell cycle exit. These same loci remain in the periphery of the nucleus during replication under highly proliferative conditions. These results suggest that mammalian cells undergo a large-scale reorganization of chromatin during the rounds of DNA <b>replication</b> that precede <b>cell</b> cycle exit...|$|R
2500|$|PAHs {{that affect}} cancer {{initiation}} are typically first chemically modified by enzymes into metabolites that react with DNA, leading to mutations. When the DNA sequence is altered in genes that regulate <b>cell</b> <b>replication,</b> cancer can result. Mutagenic PAHs, such as benzopyrene, usually have {{four or more}} aromatic rings {{as well as a}} [...] "bay region", a structural pocket that increases reactivity of the molecule to the metabolizing enzymes. Mutagenic metabolites of PAHs include diol epoxides, quinones, and radical PAH cations. These metabolites can bind to DNA at specific sites, forming bulky complexes called DNA adducts that can be stable or unstable. Stable adducts may lead to DNA replication errors, while unstable adducts react with the DNA strand, removing a purine base (either adenine or guanine). Such mutations, if they are not repaired, can transform genes encoding for normal cell signaling proteins into cancer-causing oncogenes. Quinones can also repeatedly generate reactive oxygen species that may independently damage DNA.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} a cell to be {{transformed}} by a virus, the viral DNA must be entered into the host cell. [...] The simplest consideration is viral transformation of a bacterial cell. [...] This process is called lysogeny. [...] As shown in Figure 2, a bacteriophage lands on a cell and pins itself to the cell. [...] The phage can then penetrate the cell membrane and inject the viral DNA into the host cell. [...] The viral DNA can then either lay dormant until stimulated by a source such as UV light {{or it can be}} immediately taken up by the host's genome. [...] In either case the viral DNA will replicate along with the original host DNA during <b>cell</b> <b>replication</b> causing two cells to now be infected with the virus. [...] The process will continue to propagate more and more infected cells. [...] This process is in contrast to the lytic cycle where a virus only uses the host cell's replication machinery to replicate itself before destroying the host cell.|$|E

40|$|The human β-globin genes {{constitute}} a large chromosomal domain that is developmentally regulated. In nonerythroid cells, these genes replicate late in S phase, while in erythroid <b>cells,</b> <b>replication</b> is early. The replication origin is packaged with acetylated histones in erythroid cells, yet {{is associated with}} deacetylated histones in nonerythroid cells. Recruitment of histone acetylases to this origin brings about a transcription-independent shift to early replication in lymphocytes. In contrast, tethering of a histone deacetylase in erythroblasts causes a shift to late replication. These results suggest that histone modification at the origin serves as a binary switch for controlling replication timing...|$|R
50|$|Infection {{occurs when}} a {{susceptible}} insect consumes the polyhedra, usually as a contaminant on the insect’s food (in most cases, foliage of a plant). The polyhedra dissolve in the digestive tract of the insect, releasing the virus particles that penetrate the gut epithelial <b>cells.</b> <b>Replication</b> of the virus is often confined to these cells and the progeny virus, {{in the form of}} new polyhedra are excreted in the insect feces, thus contaminating more foliage resulting in the spread of the disease to additional insects. The progression of the disease can be rather slow, but the virus infection is normally fatal.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{recombinant}} plasmid containing the Choristoneura fumiferana multinucleocapsid {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} (CfMNPV) HindIII R fragment (m. u. 2. 2 - 3. 9) was shown to undergo CfMNPV infection-dependent DNA replication in Cf- 124 T <b>cells.</b> <b>Replication</b> of this DNA sequence was detectable by 24 hr p. i. and {{did not appear to}} have resulted as a consequence of recombination with the virus genome. Replication was inhibited by mimosine, an inhibitor of eukaryotic DNA replication. These data suggest that HindIII R of CfMNPV DNA contains an origin of DNA replication which we call ori 1. HindIII R contains five GC-rich and three AT-rich regions and a 0. 9 -kb homologous repeat region 1 (hr 1). Two short 440 - and 740 -bp contiguous sequences at the right end of the HindIII R fragment separately exhibited limited ori function. HindIII R subfragments with optimal ori activity contained a cluster of repeated and inverted sequences including nine copies of a 50 -bp homologous repeat sequence (hr 1 a to hr 1 i) within hr 1. The CfMNPV hr 1 sequence was somewhat homologous with the homologous repeat (hr) of the putative Autographa californica MNPV (AcMNPV) replication origins. HindIII Y, another CfMNPV DNA fragment containing an hr sequence, hr 3, also supported infection-dependent DNA replication, suggesting that it too contains an ori. Although replication of a putative AcMNPV origin (HindIII Q) was detectable in CfMNPV-infected Cf- 124 T <b>cells,</b> <b>replication</b> of CfMNPV Hind III R was not detectable in AcMNPV-infected Spodoptera frugiperda cells...|$|R
