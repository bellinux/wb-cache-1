5|$|Cross Days is {{a visual}} novel. These are {{essentially}} played by watching {{and listening to}} episodic sequences of story and then selecting, or ignoring, clickable actions or responses when they are presented to the player. These <b>choices</b> <b>are</b> intricately linked to alternating routes of plot, moderately changing {{the direction of the}} story as each is made, ultimately leading to erotic scenes between characters and one of various endings. Unique to the game are yaoi routes, in which the protagonist crossdresses as a maid and engages in homosexual intercourse.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} critiques {{of the theory}} from several perspectives. Arguments include that it {{emphasizes}} justice {{to the exclusion of}} other moral values, such as caring; that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral <b>choices</b> <b>are</b> mostly post hoc rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists studying them) of essentially intuitive decisions.|$|E

40|$|<b>Choice</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the central}} {{elements}} in the experience of free will, but it has not received a good account from either compatibilists or libertarians. This paper develops an account of choice based around three features: (i) <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> an action; (ii) <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> not determined by one's prior beliefs and desires; (iii) once the question of what to do has arisen, <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> typically both necessary and sufficient for moving to action. These features might appear to support a libertarian account, but they do not. Instead it is argued that all three features can be accommodated within a compatibilist account, where <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> needed because of agents' inabilities to arrive at judgements about what <b>is</b> best. <b>Choice</b> differs though from random picking: in choosing, agents frequently (though not always) deploy abilities that enable them to make good choices. In such cases, judgements about what is best will frequently follow the <b>choice.</b> Finally, <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> distinguished from agency and, {{on the basis of the}} distinction, the claim that <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> an action is made good...|$|R
5|$|In the Case 1 diagram, B1 cells show {{canonical}} values, {{which are}} color-coded {{to show their}} row-wise distribution in B2 triplets. Colors reflect distribution but not location or values. For this case: the B2 top row triplet (r21) has 1 value from B1 middle triplet, the other colorings can now be deduced. E.g. the B2 bottom row triplet (r23) coloring is forced by r21: the other 2 B1 middle values must go to bottom, etc. Fill {{in the number of}} B2 options for each color, 3..1, beginning top left. The B3 color-coding is omitted since the B3 <b>choices</b> <b>are</b> row-wise determined by B1, B2. B3 always contributes 3! permutations per row triplet, or 63 for the block.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of a person {{suffering}} from depression, and the story centers on their daily life, including encounters at work and their relationship with their girlfriend. The story also features various treatments for depression. Players are periodically faced with choices that alter the course of the story. To make a choice, the player must click on the corresponding hyperlink. However, <b>choices</b> <b>are</b> often crossed out and cannot be clicked on, a mechanism that Depression Quest uses to portray the character's mental state and the fact that logical decisions may not be available to them. Beneath the choices presented to the player are a set of statements about the character, indicating their level of depression, {{whether or not they are}} in therapy, and whether or not they are currently on medication.|$|E
5|$|The {{submission}} {{process is}} overseen {{by members of}} the Swedish Music Publishers Association (SMFF), whose task is {{to reduce the number of}} songs, which have numbered over 3,000 a year since 2002, to around 1,200. The 3,440 entries received in the preselection for Melodifestivalen 2009 is the most in the competition's history. The SMFF's <b>choices</b> <b>are</b> then given to a sixteen-person jury of music professionals, SVT staff and other members of the public. The jury ranges from teenagers to people in their fifties. The songs that qualify, along with their composers and lyricists, are announced at the end of September. This is often followed by fervent speculation over who will perform the songs. Songwriters that qualify must provide interviews to SVT, attend a press conference before the competition, and remain open to promotional appearances if their song reaches the final.|$|E

Things {{done on the}} spur of the moment, and things done by animals and children can be willing, but driven by desire and spirit and not what we would normally call true <b>choice.</b> <b>Choice</b> <b>is</b> rational, and according to the understanding of Aristotle, <b>choice</b> can <b>be</b> in opposition to desire. <b>Choice</b> <b>is</b> also not wishing for things one does not believe can be achieved, such as immortality, but rather always concerning realistic aims. <b>Choice</b> <b>is</b> also not simply to do with opinion, because our choices make us the type of person we are, and are not simply true or false. What distinguishes <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> that before a <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> made there is a rational deliberation or thinking things through.|$|R

Present {{as an important}} value for the delivery of public services, of particular interest here <b>is</b> <b>choice</b> {{at the end of}} life. By focusing on older people residing in care homes, a number of questions are raised about the implications of this aspiration. What does choice mean for older people who are societally marginalised and live in a care setting that sits, primarily, outside public provision? Aspects of <b>choice</b> <b>are</b> explored here with respect to when <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> offered, what care is provided and where this occurs.

40|$|The <b>choice</b> {{operator}} <b>is</b> {{essential for}} the description of action-based reactive systems. If the atomicity of actions is dropped (e. g. by action refinement), one has to decide when the <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> triggered. The standard approach is to trigger the choice when actions start. This thesis examine the alternative approach that the <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> triggered when actions terminate. This end-based <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> motivated and a process algebra, which contains an end-based choice and an action refinement operator, is established. Consistent semantics (operational, denotational, axiomatical) are given. Furthermore, {{the difference between the}} start-based and the end-based <b>choice</b> <b>are</b> examined, in particular with respect to equivalence notions. New equivalence are established, since the standard equivalences are not preserved by the end-based action refinement operator...|$|R
5|$|When first {{playing the}} game, the player assumes {{the role of}} Yukito Kunisaki and the {{scenarios}} for the three heroines are available in {{what is called the}} Dream story arc. After the plot lines for these three heroines have been completed, an additional scenario called Summer is made available where the player assumes the role of RyÅ«ya. Summer is a linear novel arc in which no <b>choices</b> <b>are</b> presented to the player. Upon the completion of the Summer route, another scenario called Air is made available, which serves as the true ending to the story. In Air, the player assumes the role of a crow named Sora. In the adult versions of the game, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Yukito and a given heroine having sex. Later, Key released versions of Air without the erotic content.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} makes choices {{throughout}} the game, the gameplay's plot is revealed. Besides affecting dialogue and story developments, {{the outcome of}} entire scenes (and in some cases, the outcome of scenes several chapters later) can be manipulated {{to a certain extent}} based on player choices. These <b>choices</b> <b>are</b> typically moral decisions made through Jodie's dialogue options, interventions with various characters, success or failure in her combat scenes, or psychic actions that the player chooses to have Aiden perform. Examples of choice-based outcomes are the chapter titled The Party, where the player is given the choice of unleashing brutal revenge toward a group of bullies or simply running away, and the chapter titled The Embassy, where the player can either engage in psychic information retrieval or can jeopardize the mission by forcing one of the guards to commit suicide. Choices also determine the finale of Beyond: Two Souls, as any number of possible plot endings can be experienced by the player.|$|E
5|$|During the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} the onscreen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies. Like previous games in the series and most role-playing games, characters level up each time they earn a set number of experience points from defeating enemies; each level gained increases the character's statistics, thus improving their performance in battle. Statistic examples include hit points, the amount of damage a character can receive; magic points, which {{determine the number of}} times a character can use magical attacks; strength, the power of a character's physical attacks; and intelligence, the power of a character's magical spells. Upon encountering an enemy, the player can use a variety of weapons to attack and defeat the enemy. Despite the game being set in 2036, the weapon <b>choices</b> <b>are</b> largely medieval, including swords, axes, and spears, although handguns and a rocket-propelled grenade are available. These weapons differ in their damage output, the range of the weapon, and the speed of the attack.|$|E

Ordered <b>choice</b> <b>is</b> analogous to soft cut operators available in some logic programming languages.|$|R
5|$|Planetarian is a post-apocalyptic visual {{novel in}} which the player assumes {{the role of the}} junker. Unlike {{traditional}} visual novels, no <b>choices</b> <b>are</b> given to the player in Planetarian to advance the story, and there is only one possible ending; this is what Key referred to as a kinetic novel. The player can choose when to advance to the next dialogue screen or put the game on auto play. In this respect, the player does not play the game {{as if it were a}} video game, but plays it rather more like one would play a music track on a CD or play a DVD film. During gameplay, the player can choose to hide the text from view and go back to any previous lines. The game can be saved at any point in any of the five save slots available, and a load option is available where the player can load any of the automatically saved chapter markers, or choose to load any of the manually saved games.|$|E
