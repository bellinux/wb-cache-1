40|$|Abstract — Nowadays, {{technological}} development demands efficiency {{of time and}} energy in all fields {{in order to create a}} product that can compete in the global market. Breakthroughs and innovations are needed merely to survive in manufacturing industry. Punching is the common process of using a <b>cutting</b> <b>punch</b> and die in the manufacturing process. A variety of physical phenomena occur in the metal cutting process such as metal flow, friction between the material and tools, process heat and changes in the microstructure of the material. Much research conerning dimensions, tolerances, cutting angles and cutting force has been carried out. This article discusses and examines the relationship between clearance, punch and dies circularity and circularity of the product of the punching process. Testing has been conducted using various punches with different diameters and different circularity conditions. The Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) which has an accuracy of 1 micron was used to measure the diameter of the punch and the dies, the clearance and circularity of the punch and dies, and the resulting product. The question is: is the circularity of the product of punching affected by the clearance or by the circularity of such tools? Keywords- CMM. I...|$|E

40|$|Optimization of {{punching}} {{process in the}} tribological system consisting of a ceramic punching tool, a lubricant and a sheet metal was accomplished by comparison of test specimens made of ceramic with tungsten carbide (H 40 S) and an alloyed tool steel (1. 3343). The sheet material was steel of different strength (300 - 900 N/mm 2), an aluminium alloy and a copper alloy. In all series of experiments ceramic stamps with a diameter of 8 mm achieved a higher share of smooth cut area than punches of cemented carbides or high speed steel. The friction and wear investigations according to the pin-on-disc-procedure assist the choice of tool materials for the tribological system consisting of <b>cutting</b> <b>punch,</b> lubricant and sheet metal.

The matrix was inserted {{into the bottom of the}} adjustable mold and the negative space formed by the mold cavity plus the matrix acted as the master for each letter that was cast. The casting material was an alloy usually containing lead, which had a low melting point, cooled readily, and could be easily filed and finished. In those early days, type design had to not only imitate the familiar handwritten forms common to readers, but also account for the limitations of the printing process, such as the rough papers of uneven thicknesses, the squeezing or splashing properties of the ink, and the eventual wear on the type itself.|$|R
