25|$|Highwall mining {{is another}} form of surface mining that evolved from auger mining. In Highwall mining, the coal seam is {{penetrated}} by a continuous miner propelled by a hydraulic Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM). A typical cycle includes sumping (launch-pushing forward) and shearing (raising and lowering the <b>cutterhead</b> boom to cut the entire height of the coal seam). As the coal recovery cycle continues, the <b>cutterhead</b> is progressively launched into the coal seam for 19.72 feet (6.01 m). Then, the Pushbeam Transfer Mechanism (PTM) automatically inserts a 19.72-foot (6.01 m) long rectangular Pushbeam (Screw-Conveyor Segment) into the center section of the machine between the Powerhead and the <b>cutterhead.</b> The Pushbeam system can penetrate nearly 1,000 feet (300 m) into the coal seam. One patented Highwall mining system uses augers enclosed inside the Pushbeam that prevent the mined coal from being contaminated by rock debris during the conveyance process. Using a video imaging and/or a gamma ray sensor and/or other Geo-Radar systems like a coal-rock interface detection sensor (CID), the operator can see ahead projection of the seam-rock interface and guide the continuous miner's progress. Highwall mining can produce {{thousands of tons of}} coal in contour-strip operations with narrow benches, previously mined areas, trench mine applications and steep-dip seams with controlled water-inflow pump system and/or a gas (inert) venting system.|$|E

40|$|As {{part of its}} water-jet-assisted rock cutting research, the Bureau of Mines has {{initiated}} a study into the mechanism of rock fragmentation by water-jet-assisted mechanical tools. The objective {{of this research is}} to increase coal extraction efficiency by seeking an improved understanding of the synergistic relationship between mechanical cutters and water jets, enabling the design of more effective <b>cutterheads.</b> Rock chips collected during laboratory traverse speed jet-assisted cutting tests were analyzed with respect to the size distribution of the chips and the forces measured during cutting. As the water-jet pressure was increased, the size distribution of the product became coarser with v-face-type cutting tools producing less fine material than conical cutting tools. Fracture mechanics theory accounted for less than 10 pct of the energy consumed during fragmentation of the rock. The energy consumed by processes other than rock breakage decreased with the use of water jets and increasing advance rate. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 NIOSHTIC no. 1000564...|$|R

40|$|O estudo das tensões em colhedoras de forragens é imprescindível, uma vez que as condições de operação são muito variáveis e severas. Utilizou-se um sistema "datalogger" devidamente calibrado para medir as tensões, em função do tempo, numa colhedora de forragem. Foram desenvolvidos modelos matemáticos para obter a variação periódica dessas tensões, considerando-se a influência da roda de apoio e da velocidade angular do rotor de corte. O ajuste dos modelos foi verificado pelo coeficiente de determinação (R²). A variação periódica das tensões, em função do tempo, para os valores experimentais e teóricos, foi representada graficamente, utilizando-se da planilha eletrônica EXCEL. Observou-se que as menores amplitudes de tensões e os maiores períodos do ciclo corresponderam aos tratamentos que utilizaram a roda de apoio. A análise estatística mostrou que a velocidade angular do rotor de corte apresentou diferença significativa, {{conforme}} o Teste de Tukey, para 5 %. Com base nos resultados obtidos, concluiu-se que os ciclos de tensões em colhedoras de forragens podem ser representados com bom ajuste por funções senoidais e que o uso da roda de apoio pode aumentar o tempo de serviço da colhedora. The {{study of}} stress in forage harvester is necessary, because the operation conditions are very different and rigorous.

Mathematical models were developed to obtain the periodical variation of this stress by considering the influence of support wheel and the angular velocity of <b>cutterheads.</b> The agreement of these models was verified by the determination coefficient (R²). The periodical variation of stress as function of time for both experimental and theoretical values was graphically represented by using of the software EXCEL. It was observed that the minimal amplitude stress and the maximal periods of cycle corresponded to the treatments employed, which utilized the support wheel. The statistical analysis showed that the angular velocity of <b>cutterheads</b> presented significant difference, according to the Tukey Test for 5 %. Based on the obtained results was concluded that, the stress cycle can be represented by senoidal functions with an adequate agreement, and that the operation time of harvesters can be increased by using a support wheel...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: During {{the process}} of dredging, sediments are {{excavated}} and relocated. At various points in the process some volume of sediment is injected into the water column, either at the dredging site or at the dredged material disposal site. The amounts may be relatively small (e. g., around operating hydraulic <b>cutterheads)</b> or substantial (e. g., unconfined open-water disposal). The fate of these resuspended sediments, even if uncontaminated, {{is a source of}} concern. Potential detrimental effects generally fall into two categories: water column effects (i. e. exposure to suspended sediments) and sedimentation effects. Potential impacts of suspended sediments on aquatic organisms have previously been reviewed (e. g., Newcombe and Jensen 1996; Wilber and Clarke 2001); however, only recently has the subject of sedimentation in the context of dredging effects received such attention (e. g., Berry et al. 2003). Much of the existing literature pertaining to detrimental effects of sedimentation focuses on freshwater streams rather than coastal water bodies. This technical note summarizes the current scientific literature with emphasis on effects of uncontaminated, bedded sediments on estuarine and marine organisms. This review consolidates existing information on sedimentation effects, identifies aspects of natural and anthropogenic sedimentation processes that may be problematic, and identifies gap...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Wood mouldings are long, narrow pieces of timber with ornamental profiles fonned on one or more faces. They are used in furniture, architecture and joinery industries and typical applications include door/window frames, skirting boards and picture frames. Conventionally, wood mouldings are produced by planing/moulding machines, where cutting edges, attached to rotating <b>cutterheads,</b> sever chips from advancing workpieces. The cutting edges are shaped specifically for each individual moulding profile; hence, the raw material is transfonned into the finished product with a single feed. When the production is to be changed from one profile to another, the conventional machines requite new cutter knives that are manufactured for the profile to be machined. This requitement introduces tooling and machine set-up costs which cannot be compensated in shorter production runs. In order to minimize the aforementioned costs in short production runs, this thesis aims at the holistic development of Profile Independent Wood-Moulding Machine (pIMM). In the PIMM concept, the profIle geometry is supplied directly from CAD drawings, and the profile-specific cutter knives of the conventional process are emulated by position control of a single cutting tool along software generated trajectories. This thesis approaches the PIMM from an integrated mechatronic design perspective. Alternative solutions for mechanical, electrical and software components of the system were generated and evaluated via mathematical modelling and simulation. Then, the selected solutions were realized in a proof-of concept PIMM system, {{and the effectiveness of}} the proposed method has been investigated through machining experiments. Overall, this research proposes a new machining method and demonstrates an integrated design process that initiates from an idea and results in a fully functional, physical mechatronic system; via efficient use of software, simulation and rapid prototyping technologies...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} auger dredge {{on the global}} market today is the Versi-Dredge. The {{turbidity}} shroud on auger dredge systems creates a strong suction vacuum, causing much less turbidity than conical (basket) type cutterheads {{and so they are}} preferred for environmental applications. The vacuum created by the shroud and the ability to convey material to the pump faster makes auger dredge systems more productive than similar sized conical (basket) type <b>cutterhead</b> dredges.|$|E
50|$|In {{soft ground}} with very high water {{pressure}} or where ground conditions are granular (sands and gravels) {{so much so}} that a plug could not be formed in the Archimedes screw, Slurry Shield TBMs are needed. The <b>cutterhead</b> is filled with pressurised slurry which applies hydrostatic pressure to the excavation face. The slurry also acts as a transport medium by mixing with the excavated material before being pumped out of the <b>cutterhead</b> back to a slurry separation plant, usually outside of the tunnel. Slurry separation plants are multi-stage filtration systems, which remove particles of spoil from the slurry so that it may be reused in the construction process. The limit to which slurry can be 'cleaned' depends on the particle size of the excavated material. For this reason, slurry TBMs are not suitable for silts and clays as the particle sizes of the spoil are less than that of the bentonite clay from which the slurry is made. In this case, the slurry is separated into water, which can be recycled and a clay cake, which may be polluted, is pressed from the water.|$|E
50|$|In soft ground, {{there are}} three main types of TBMs: Earth Pressure Balance Machines (EPB), Slurry Shield (SS) and {{open-face}} type. Both types of closed machines operate like Single Shield TBMs, using thrust cylinders to advance forward by pushing off against concrete segments. Earth Pressure Balance Machines are used in soft ground with less than 7 bar of pressure. The cutter head does not use disc cutters only, but instead an combination of tungsten carbide cutting bits, carbide disc cutters, drag picks and/or hard rock disc cutters. The EPB gets its name because it uses the excavated material to balance the pressure at the tunnel face. Pressure is maintained in the <b>cutterhead</b> by controlling the rate of extraction of spoil through the Archimedes screw and the advance rate. Additives such as bentonite, polymers and foam can be injected ahead of the face to increase {{the stability of the}} ground. Additives can also be injected in the cutterhead/extraction screw to ensure that the spoil remains sufficiently cohesive to form a plug in the Archimedes screw to maintain pressure in the <b>cutterhead</b> and restrict water flowing through.|$|E
50|$|A wood moulder is {{a machine}} used to shape wood with {{profiled}} cutters. The profiled cutters are {{also known as}} knives, and blades. Tooling refers to cutters, knives, blades including planer blades, and cutterheads. Most moulders require the blades to be secured into a <b>cutterhead</b> that mounts on the shaft(s) of the machine. However, some machines such as the Williams & Hussey and the Shop Fox require the blades to bolt directly onto the shaft of the machine. The wood being fed into a moulder is {{commonly referred to as}} either “stock” or “blanks”.|$|E

50|$|Forage {{harvesters}} can be implements {{attached to}} a tractor, or they can be self-propelled units. In either configuration, they have either a drum (<b>cutterhead)</b> or a flywheel {{with a number of}} knives fixed to it that chops and blows the silage out a chute of the harvester into a wagon that is either connected to the harvester or to another vehicle driving alongside. Most larger machines also have paddle accelerators to increase material speed and improve unloading characteristics. Once a wagon is filled up, the wagon can be detached and taken back to a silo for unloading, and another wagon can be attached. Because corn and grass require different types of cutting equipment, there are different heads for each type of silage, and these heads can be connected and disconnected from the harvester. Grass silage is usually cut prior to harvesting to allow it to wilt, before being harvested from swathes with a collection header (windrow pickup). Maize and whole crop silage are cut directly by the header, using reciprocating knives, disc mowers or large saw-like blades. Kernel processors (KP), modules consisting of two mill rolls with teeth pressed together by powerful springs, are frequently used when harvesting cereal crops like corn and sorghum to crack the kernels of these plant heads. Kernel processors are installed between the <b>cutterhead</b> and accelerator. In most forage harvesters, the KP can be quickly removed and replaced with a grass chute for chopping non-cereal crops.|$|E

However, subsequent investigations revealed that portions of the main bearing seal system were damaged, which caused the bearing to overheat during operation. Over the next two years, a recovery pit was dug from the surface in order to access and lift the machine's <b>cutterhead</b> for repair and partial replacement in 2015.|$|E
50|$|The tunnel {{alignment}} {{is located}} in a seismically active region, about 17 km to the North Anatolian Fault Zone. To decrease the seismic stresses/strains below the permissible levels, two flexible seismic joints/segments; with displacement limits of ±50 mm for shear and ±75 mm for extraction/contraction; were innovated, designed specially, localized through geological/geophysical/geotechnical conditions, tested in laboratory; implemented ‘first time’ in TBM tunnelling under similar severe conditions. The design earthquake magnitude was specified as moment magnitude of 7.25 and design of functional and safety evaluation earthquakes have a return period of 500 and 2,500 years, respectively. Seismic joint locations defined during design phase were verified through continuous monitoring of <b>cutterhead</b> torques.|$|E
