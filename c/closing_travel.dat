50|$|The film {{documents}} how Ry Cooder, long-time {{friend of}} Wenders, brought together the ensemble of legendary Cuban musicians to record an album (also called Buena Vista Social Club) and to perform two {{times with a}} full line-up: in April 1998 in Amsterdam (two nights) and the 1st of July 1998 in the United States (at the Carnegie Hall, New York City). Although they are geographically <b>close,</b> <b>travel</b> between Cuba and the United States is restricted due to the political {{tension between the two}} countries, so many of the artists were travelling there for the first time. The film shows their reactions to this experience, as well as including footage of the resultant sell-out concert. It also includes interviews with each of the main performers.|$|R

50|$|The {{border between}} Spania and Visigothic kingdom was not <b>closed.</b> <b>Travel</b> between the border for {{personal}} and mercantile reasons was allowed {{and the two}} regions experienced prolonged periods of peace. The ease of traversing the frontier was noted by the exiled Leander, whose brother more than once crossed it without hindrance. The border had been determined by a treaty (pacta) between Athanagild and Justinian I, but {{the date of the}} treaty is still debated. It may {{have been part of the}} initial conditions of Byzantine assistance in 551 or 552 or it may have been a product of the war between Goth and Roman in 555 or later. It was certainly signed before Justinian's death in 565. The legitimacy of the pacta was recognised as late as the 7th century, which accounts for the ease of travel and trade.|$|R
50|$|There {{had been}} another General Election in United Kingdom, won {{again by the}} Conservatives. Alan Lennox-Boyd was the new Secretary of States for the Colonies.

They were able to speak freely and they shared a sense of humour. Lennox-Boyd agreed to hold constitutional talks in London in January 1956, provided that the Rulers were represented. When the Rulers met at their conferences in Kuala Lumpur in September 1955, Tunku sought and was granted a special audience. Tunku asked the Rulers to appoint representatives for the constitutional talks {{to be held in}} London. As the days for the talks got <b>closer,</b> <b>travel</b> plans were discussed.|$|R

40|$|Theoretical {{research}} often assumes all {{users are}} homogeneous in their route choice decision {{and will always}} pick the route with the shortest travel cost, which {{is not necessarily the}} case in reality. This paper documents the research effort in developing a Constrained Time-Dependent K Shortest Paths Algorithm in order to find K Shortest Paths between two given locations. The goal of this research is to provide sound route options to travelers in order to assist their route choice decision process, during which the overlap and travel time deviation issues between the K paths will be considered. The proposed algorithm balancing overlap and travel time deviation is developed in this research. A numerical analysis is conducted on the Tucson I- 10 network, the outcome of the case study shows that our proposed algorithm is able to find different shortest paths with a reasonable degree of similarity and <b>close</b> <b>travel</b> time, which indicates that the result of the proposed algorithm is satisfactory...|$|R

40|$|This {{report has}} {{documented}} the research performed {{to assess the}} effectiveness of a flashing warning light system as a work zone traffic control device. Researchers investigated motorist understanding of and perceived usefulness of various designs of the warning light system in a simulated work zone at night at TTI’s proving ground facility at the Texas A&M University Riverside Campus. Field studies of the warning light system were also performed at night to determine if the system would yield significant operational or safety benefits in actual work zone applications. Furthermore, researchers discussed the physical design of the warning light system in respect to the problems encountered while using the system in the proving ground and field studies. Proving ground and field studies show that the warning light system is perceived positively and is not confusing to the motoring public, and may encourage motorists to vacate a <b>closed</b> <b>travel</b> lane sooner (which is believed to offer a potential safety benefit). However, researchers believe that the current design (cable interconnected directional LED lights) of the system will be difficult to implement and maintain in a field setting. Therefore, researchers recommend that TxDOT consider the following: 1) TxDO...|$|R
