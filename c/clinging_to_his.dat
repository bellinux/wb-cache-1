As they each try to comfort her, {{the cause of his}} death is {{revealed}} to have been a blood clot that led to a fatal stroke. Stevens says that if she had taken less time to dress, she would have arrived at his room sooner and could have been with him while he died. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) then talks to Stevens, picking her up and hugging her. Afterward, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), who {{did not know how to}} handle Burke's situation, goes to his room and puts her hand on his to show him her support.

25|$|In mid-1890s Nocedal {{realized}} that his bid to launch a nationwide Catholic ultraconservative party had failed; <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> intransigence, he nevertheless refused to reconsider the Integrist project and thought it his moral duty to represent orthodox Christian values and confront liberalism against all odds. Other members of the party were not so principled and until his death Nocedal {{had to deal with}} successive defections, though there was no-one who posed a serious threat to his personal lead.|$|E

2500|$|Following Ehud Barak's defeat by Ariel Sharon in the 2001 direct {{election}} for Prime Minister, Peres made yet another comeback. He led Labor {{into a national}} unity government with Sharon's Likud and secured the post of Foreign Minister. The formal leadership of the party passed to Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, and in 2002 to Haifa mayor Amram Mitzna. Peres was much criticized on the left for <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> position as Foreign Minister in a government that was not seen as advancing the peace process, despite his own dovish stance. He left office only when Labor resigned from the government {{in advance of the}} 2003 elections. After the party under the leadership of Mitzna suffered a crushing defeat, Peres again emerged as interim leader. He led the party into a coalition with Sharon once more at the end of 2004 when the latter's support of [...] "disengagement" [...] from Gaza presented a diplomatic program Labor could support.|$|E
