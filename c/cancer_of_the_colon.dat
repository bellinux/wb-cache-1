25|$|People with {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) are {{at increased}} risk of colon cancer. The risk increases the longer a person has the disease, and the worse the severity of inflammation. In these high risk groups, both prevention with aspirin and regular colonoscopies are recommended. People with {{inflammatory bowel disease}} account for less than 2% of colon cancer cases yearly. In those with Crohn's disease 2% get colorectal cancer after 10years, 8% after 20years, and 18% after30 years. In those with ulcerative colitis approximately 16% develop either a cancer precursor or <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colon</b> over 30years.|$|E

500|$|Rollason began feeling unwell in 1996 {{during an}} eight-week {{assignment}} to the US, {{where she was}} covering that year's Olympic and Paralympic Games. She was diagnosed with <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colon</b> in August 1997, which she was told had also spread to her liver. She was initially given three months to live, but confounded medical opinion by fighting the disease long after that. She underwent treatment with chemotherapy, but also used a combination of holistic therapies and diet to treat her condition. The cancer later metastasised to her lungs. Rollason continued to work throughout her illness, despite sessions of chemotherapy that left her feeling weak, and cited her work as the thing that had kept her going throughout her treatment. [...] "I stay working because I love it, and because I feel best on the days when I'm busy. I'd far rather work than hang around the house – {{even though there are}} days when I can hardly get out of bed." [...] She presented sports bulletins for BBC News, wrote a weekly column about her illness for the Sunday Mirror Magazine and worked on a book about her experience that she hoped would help others diagnosed with the disease. She cited the determination of the many disabled athletes she had got to know through her work as having given her the strength of mind to fight her illness. In October 1998, the BBC aired a special edition of its QED documentary series titled Hope for Helen, which followed her as she underwent a course of treatment. The film earned her much support from the public for her courage. in December 1998, colleagues paid tribute to an emotional-looking Rollason during the BBC's Sports Review of the Year, a compliment that produced mixed feelings for the presenter. She later wrote of the incident, [...] "I felt a mixture of horror, embarrassment and incredible warmth towards my colleagues that they should think of doing this".|$|E
2500|$|Most {{cases of}} anal cancer {{are related to}} {{infection}} with the human papilloma virus (HPV). Anal sex alone does not cause anal cancer; the risk of anal cancer through anal sex is attributed to HPV infection, which is often contracted through unprotected anal sex.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] To {{study the}} size and {{consistency}} of socioeconomic differences in cancer patient survival as reported in published studies. METHODS [...] A systematic review was conducted. Several criteria were developed to select the study material, which resulted in 14 reports on socioeconomic differences in survival for <b>cancers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colon,</b> rectum, lung, prostate, breast, and cervix. These present results on patients from the United States, Japan, Australia, United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, and Germany. The results are summarised in a relative risk of dying or survival ratio for the lowest socioeconomic status group compared with the highest. RESULTS [...] For <b>cancers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colon,</b> rectum, breast, and cervix, patients from higher socioeconomic status groups had a better survival. For lung <b>cancer</b> and <b>cancer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prostate, results were unclear. CONCLUSION [...] Socioeconomic differences in cancer survival are generally small and their contribution to socioeconomic differences in cancer mortality is probably small too. These findings have implications for <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> health policy measures which {{should be taken to}} reduce socioeconomic differences in cancer mortality...|$|R

40|$|A 74 -year-old female was {{diagnosed}} with the autoimmune inflammatory disease temporal arteritis and treated with high and low doses of prednisone {{over a period of}} 6 years.

40|$|AbstractThe G protein-coupled human gastrin-releasing peptide {{receptor}} (hGRP-R) {{is frequently}} found aberrantly expressed in human <b>cancers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colon,</b> stomach, and lung, and its ligand-specific activation has {{been implicated in}} cell proliferation and differentiation. Here, we demonstrated hGRP-R activation stimulated sustained cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and transactivation in duodenal cancer cells through a protein kinase C and partially p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathway. In contrast, intracellular calcium, ERK 1 / 2, protein kinase A, and PI 3 kinase were not involved. This novel signaling mechanism might be of importance for regulation of CREB-dependent gene expression in human cancer expressing functional hGRP-R...|$|R
