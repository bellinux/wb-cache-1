5|$|Mice {{have been}} used as an {{experimental}} system to investigate possible mechanisms by which levels of sex steroid hormones might regulate nervous system function. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when progesterone is highest, the level of nerve-cell GABA receptor subtype delta was high. Since these GABA receptors are inhibitory, nerve <b>cells</b> <b>with</b> more delta receptors are less likely to fire than <b>cells</b> <b>with</b> lower numbers of delta receptors. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when estrogen levels are higher than progesterone levels, the number of delta receptors decrease, increasing nerve cell activity, in turn increasing anxiety and seizure susceptibility.|$|E

5|$|A few species release fertilized {{eggs into}} the water, but most retain the eggs until they hatch. There are {{four types of}} larvae, but all are balls of <b>cells</b> <b>with</b> an outer layer of cells whose flagellae or cilia enable the larvae to move.

5|$|Arboreal frogs have pads {{located on}} the ends of their toes to help grip {{vertical}} surfaces. These are not suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar <b>cells</b> <b>with</b> flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands. When the frog applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities on the surface and the grip is maintained through surface tension. This allows the frog to climb on smooth surfaces, but the system does not function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet.|$|E
5|$|Archaea show {{high levels}} of {{horizontal}} gene transfer between lineages. Some researchers suggest that individuals can be grouped into species-like populations given highly similar genomes and infrequent gene transfer to/from <b>cells</b> <b>with</b> less-related genomes, as in the genus Ferroplasma. On the other hand, studies in Halorubrum found significant genetic transfer to/from less-related populations, limiting the criterion's applicability. A second concern is to what extent such species designations have practical meaning.|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we report}} our {{experimental}} {{results of the}} PEM fuel <b>cell</b> <b>with</b> metal foam as flow distributor. These experimental results show {{the characteristics of the}} PEM fuel <b>cell</b> <b>with</b> the metal foam as flow distributor and extend our understanding of the relation between cell performance and mass transport properties into a region of parameters that the conventional PEM unit cell cannot provide. The comparison in polarization curve is made between the PEM unit <b>cell</b> <b>with</b> different metal-foam properties and the PEM unit <b>cell</b> <b>with</b> graphite flow channel plate as flow distributor. The experimental results show that the PEM fuel <b>cell</b> <b>with</b> metal foam as flow distributor possesses some unique characteristics compared with the conventional PEM unit <b>cell</b> <b>with</b> flow channel plate as flow distributor. The unique characteristics are listed in this paper with our preliminary analysis. Due to the high porosity of metal-foam (as high as 95 %) plus convective flow through the metal-foam, mass transport limitation phenomenon is not as pronounced {{as in the case of}} conventional PEM unit <b>cell</b> <b>with</b> flow channel plate as flow distributor. Another interesting phenomenon is that electrical conductivity of metal-foam plays a significant role in performance, which is seldom the case in the conventional PEM unit <b>cell</b> <b>with</b> flow channel plate as flow distributor. Although there are several technical challenges to be overcome for the current form of metal-foam to replace flow channel plates, the unique mass-transport properties of metal foam plus its light weight are very attractive.
