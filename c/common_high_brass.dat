This slight difference in instrumentation derives from the British concert band's heritage in military bands, where the <b>highest</b> <b>brass</b> instrument is always the cornet. There are usually four to six B cornets present in a British concert band, but no E instrument, as this role is taken by the E clarinet.|$|R
