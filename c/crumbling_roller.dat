25|$|In Bakloh the {{battalion}} had 16 Subalterns. Thirteen joined in 1964. Their overseer, as the senior subaltern, was the handsome, affable, and popular Virendra K Dhawan, who loved three X rum, <b>crumbling</b> <b>roller</b> cigarettes, and KL Seghal's melancholy melodies. On 6 April 2011, {{a year before}} the Golden jubilee, to the regret of legions of friends and admirers, Virendra died.|$|E
40|$|By the {{machines}} intended for tillage, which use <b>crumbling</b> and tamping <b>rollers,</b> are frequent breakdowns of their bearings. The possible reasons of breakdowns of the bearings {{in the machine}} SATURN 6 P were monitored. After {{the evaluation of the}} breakdowns were proposed two options how to replace or improve today used flanged bearings. At the conclusion is the proposed construction compared with a financial {{point of view of a}} new project, which presented the machinemaker of SATURN, in the course of writing of this thesis...|$|R
60|$|Morning {{seemed a}} very long time in coming; but at last the {{darkness}} grew less thick. The foam got whiter and the gray bulk of the rollers more solid and black, as they leaped, huge and threatening, out of the obscurity. Then the sky began to whiten in the east, and the weary men anxiously turned their eyes shoreward as they shivered in the biting cold of dawn. After a time, during which the horizon steadily receded, a gray and misty blur appeared on the starboard hand, and, now that they could see the combers, they got the Cetacea round. As she headed offshore a red flush spread across the sky, and rocks and pines grew into shape to the east. Then a break in the coastline where they could see shining water instead of foam indicated an island; and, getting her round again, they stood in cautiously, because she could make nothing to windward through the steep, white seas outshore. Reeling before them, with lee deck in the water as she bore away, she opened up the sound, and presently her crew watched the <b>rollers</b> <b>crumble</b> on a boulder-sprinkled point. Moving shoreward majestically in ordered ranks, the waves hove themselves up when they met the shoal and dissolved into frothy cataracts. It was an impressive spectacle, and the sloop looked by contrast extremely small. Still, she drove on, and Jimmy, standing at the wheel, gazed steadily ahead.|$|R
