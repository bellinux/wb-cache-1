50|$|Budding's first {{machine was}} 19 in wide with a frame made of wrought iron. The mower was pushed from behind. Cast-iron gear wheels {{transmitted}} {{power from the}} rear roller to the <b>cutting</b> <b>cylinder,</b> allowing the rear roller to drive the knives on the cutting cylinder; the ratio was 16:1. Another roller placed between the <b>cutting</b> <b>cylinder</b> and the main or land roller could be raised or lowered to alter the height of cut. The grass clippings were hurled forward into a tray-like box. It was soon realized, however, that an extra handle was needed in front to help pull the machine along. Overall, these machines were remarkably similar to modern mowers.|$|E
50|$|Top of Atco's {{cylinder}} mower range, the Royale {{was designed for}} large areas of fine lawn. The traditional 6-bladed steel <b>cutting</b> <b>cylinder</b> gave 70 cuts per yard while the heavy duty rollers helped to produce a striped finish.|$|E
50|$|Greens mowers {{are used}} for the {{precision}} cutting of golf greens and have a cylinder made up of at least eight, but normally ten, blades. The machine has a roller {{before and after the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>cylinder</b> which smoothes the freshly cut lawn and minimizes wheel marks. Due to the weight, the engine also propels the mower. Much smaller and lighter variants of the roller mower are sometimes used for small patches of ornamental lawns around flower beds, and these have no engine.|$|E

5000|$|As stated previously, the AU was {{the first}} Falcon to offer IRS (a double {{wishbone}} design on an isolated subframe). IRS was made available as an costly option on the base Forte, Fairmont and 'S' models, and standard on Fairmont Ghia, XR6 VCT and XR8 models. The updated 6-cylinder engines incorporated advanced features such as VCT on some models and a temperature sensor in the cylinder head, which detected coolant loss and allowed the car to [...] "limp home" [...] safely by <b>cutting</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The engine range comprised: the base Intech model producing 157 kW (which was carried over from the EL series but now with the above advanced electronic features); an [...] "HP" [...] version reserved to the XR6 producing 164 kW (thanks to: unique cylinder head; reshaped inlet port; redesigned exhaust port; ‘open’ combustion chamber shape to restrict pre-detonation from hot spot areas; unique camshaft; higher fuel pressure; recalibrated EEC V engine management system); the VCT version producing 172 kW for the XR6 VCT; a [...] "Windsor" [...] V8 producing 185 kW (also carried over from the EL series but without major upgrades).|$|R
50|$|It took {{ten more}} years and further {{innovations}} {{to create a}} machine that could be drawn by animals, and sixty years before a steam-powered lawn mower was built. In the 1850s, Thomas Green & Son of Leeds introduced a mower called the Silens Messor (meaning silent cutter), which used a chain drive to transmit power from the rear roller to the <b>cutting</b> <b>cylinder.</b> These machines were lighter and quieter than the gear-driven machines that preceded them, although they were slightly more expensive. The rise in popularity of lawn sports helped prompt {{the spread of the}} invention. Lawn mowers became a more efficient alternative to the scythe and domesticated grazing animals.|$|E
5000|$|Placing pins {{is done by}} [...] "feel" [...] and experience. Typically, a {{greenskeeper}} {{lets the}} weight of the cup cutting tool dangle so that gravity makes it vertical and plumb. Then the greenskeeper twists the handles to slice the round <b>cutting</b> <b>cylinder</b> into the green while trying to keep the tool in a vertical position. After the tool cuts in, it lifts a cylindrical core out of the new hole. This core of soil is saved to repair the old or previous hole after the cup is snagged and lifted out. Once the old hole is plugged with the soil and turf core, the greenskeeper places the cup into the new hole.|$|E
50|$|This {{all changed}} with the {{invention}} of the lawnmower by Edwin Beard Budding in 1830. Budding had the idea for a lawnmower after seeing a machine in a local cloth mill which used a <b>cutting</b> <b>cylinder</b> (or bladed reel) mounted on a bench to trim the irregular nap from the surface of woollen cloth and give a smooth finish. Budding realised that a similar device could be used to cut grass if the mechanism was mounted in a wheeled frame to make the blades rotate close to the lawn's surface. His mower design was to be used primarily to cut the lawn on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the scythe, and he was granted a British patent on 31 August 1830.|$|E
50|$|The {{first known}} lawn mower sported a <b>cylinder</b> <b>cutting</b> gear made of iron. It {{was used to}} mow {{sporting}} grounds and wide-ranging gardens. As manufacturers changed the design and structure of mowers, the cutting mechanism also developed and evolved into several varieties, including cylinder/reel blades, deck blades, mulching blades, and lifting blades.|$|R
50|$|The term 'boss' {{when used}} in {{engineering}} can also relate to a finishing edge around (usually) a circular opening that allows the opening to locate onto, or within another opening thus locating or joining two items together {{with a view to}} the location or joining being temporary or semi-permanent.A common everyday example of a boss is the housing of the rotation spindle in a washing machine drum, or on a cylinder lawn mower {{at the end of the}} <b>cutting</b> blade <b>cylinder</b> which may house a bearing set to allow the cylinder to rotate through one plane, but held firm in another plane.|$|R
50|$|Between 1880 and 1885, Alexander Graham Bell and his {{associates}} at the Volta Laboratory experimented {{with a variety of}} processes for improved sound recording. They eventually settled on a recording processed based on <b>cutting</b> wax <b>cylinders.</b> On January 6, 1886, the associates formed the Volta Graphophone company and were awarded a patent on their wax cylinder process. Later in the year, Edison resumed research on the phonograph. On March 28, 1887, the Volta associates established the American Graphophone Company for the manufacturing and sale of graphophones, and Edison organized the Edison Phonograph Company in the following year to protect his new research in sound.|$|R
50|$|In the 1850s, Thomas Green of Leeds {{introduced}} a revolutionary mower design called the Silens Messor (meaning silent cutter), which used a chain to transmit {{power from the}} rear roller to the <b>cutting</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The machine was much lighter and quieter than the gear driven machines that preceded them, and won first prize at the first lawn mower trial at the London Horticultural Gardens. Thus began a great expansion in the lawn mower production in the 1860s. James Sumner of Lancashire patented the first steam-powered lawn mower in 1893. Around 1900, Ransomes' Automaton, available in chain- or gear-driven models, dominated the British market. In 1902, Ransomes produced the first commercially available mower powered by an internal combustion gasoline engine. JP Engineering of Leicester, founded after World War I, invented the first riding mowers.|$|E
50|$|Initial designs envisaged a large {{circular}} cutter {{the diameter of}} the trench to be dug and operating in the manner of modern tunnel boring machines. However, the design evolved to a more efficient arrangement with a huge plough removing the top 2 ft of soil and a <b>cutting</b> <b>cylinder</b> rotating perpendicular to the line of the trench for digging out the lower 2 ft. The trench profile was then squared off by a number of blades. The spoil was deposited {{on either side of the}} trench, wings on the plough blade pushing the spoil away from the edge of the trench to prevent it from falling back in. Hopkins presented this conception together with a static model to Churchill via Sir Stanley Goodall. Churchill approved the scheme and gave permission for development of a prototype to begin with an initial grant of £1,000,000.|$|E

Two of the earliest Budding machines sold went to Regent's Park Zoological Gardens in London and the Oxford Colleges. [...] In an agreement between John Ferrabee and Edwin Budding, dated 18 May 1830, Ferrabee paid the costs of development, obtained letters of patent and acquired rights to manufacture, sell and license other manufacturers in the production of lawn mowers. Budding realised that a similar device could be used to cut grass if the mechanism was mounted in a wheeled frame to make the blades rotate close to the lawn's surface. Budding went into partnership with a local engineer, John Ferrabee, and together they made mowers in a factory at Thrupp near Stroud.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In the Brazilian Central Region, {{flowering}} of Paspalum atratum cv. Pojuca is concentrated from mid February to mid March and seed maturation occurs from mid March to mid April, {{at the onset}} of the dry season. Use of combine harvesters is an excellent option Pojuca seed production areas because, besides this concentrated flowering and uniform seed maturation, this cultivar presents lon flowering stems which expose the seed heads above the plant canopy. Good agronomical practices regarding choice of the area, tillage, fertilization, seed bed preparation, seeding, weed control will assure the a high seed yield in Pojuca grass. Combine adjustments in the air flow, <b>cutting</b> height, <b>cylinder</b> rotation, and in the threshing and sieving apparatus will reduce losses during the harvesting operation and result in high yields of good quality seeds. At the Embrapa Cerrados Research Center, in well managed Pojuca grass seed production areas, using combine harvesting, pure seed yield ranged from 200 to 300 kg/ha. 200...|$|R
5000|$|Although it was {{relatively}} easy to create a 90° V6 by simply <b>cutting</b> two <b>cylinders</b> off an existing V8 engine, this produced an engine which was wider and more vibration-prone than a 60° V6. The design was first used by Buick when it introduced its 198 CID Fireball V6 as the standard engine in the 1962 Special. The Buick V6 was notable because it had uneven firing intervals between power strokes {{as a result of}} using the 90° cylinder bank angle and sharing crankpins between piston pairs as in the V8 engine. Rather than firing evenly every 120° of crankshaft rotation, the cylinders fired alternately at 90° and 150°, resulting in strong harmonic vibrations at certain engine speeds. These engines were often referred to by mechanics as [...] "shakers", due to the tendency of the engine to vibrate at idle speed. Other examples included the Maserati V6 used in the Citroën SM, the PRV V6, the Rover KV6 (2.0- and 2.5-litre), the Honda C engine used in the NSX, Chevrolet's 4.3 L Vortec 4300 and Chrysler's 3.9 L (238 in3) Magnum V6 and 3.7 L (226 in3) PowerTech V6.|$|R

We performed progressive changes in the cutting parameters, recording data related to temperature of the cutting tool, the graduated cylinder and the removed material for later analysis and comparison with similar data from the process performed with non-coated tools. Subsequently the morphologic characterization of the coating was carried out using scan electron microscope on the <b>cutting</b> tools.

30|$|We used a MaxCore System (MC 1416) by BARD Biopsy Systems: {{penetration}} depth 22  mm, length and {{width of the}} original biopsy rift: 19  ×  2.1  mm. In a first step the original needle notch including the rift was cut away which shortened the needle by ca. 22  mm. We then manufactured a positioning frame to keep the needle under tension and mounted it on a fine metal milling machine. Two parallel 19  mm in length rifts were then milled into the needle’s shaft {{in such a way}} that a 100  µm thin sheet remained standing between them. The tip of the needle was then sharpened in the original angle to reconstitute a fully functioning needle. The <b>cutting</b> <b>cylinder,</b> which is running over the needle was adapted to the new needle length and the notch sharpened accordingly. No other modification to the biopsy system were necessary. The modifications were neither initiated by BARD Biopsy Systems nor are they covered by the company’s liability regulations. The modified biopsy system is not certified for in patient use. Prototype testing has been performed with ex vivo radical prostatectomy samples within this research project approved by our local ethics committee (328 / 15). Samples were biopsied within 15  min after resection. The patient gave written consent prior to the procedure.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis {{is concerned with the}} conception and design of a FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEM (FMS) for the automation of the manufacture of lawnmower cutting cylinders at Suffolk Lawnmowers Ltd. A review of FMS definitions, planning methods and current systems is carried out {{for the development of a}} suitable FMS configuration for the final stages of manufacture of grass cutting cylinders having 21 different design specifications. This involves examination of the capabilities of robotics and microcontrollers to automate the technologies used in cylinder production. The company's current manual batch production system is analysed to determine the suitable form and requirements of the FMS. This includes analyses of annual volumes, throughputs, batch sizes, product and process mixes. Long term objectives to automate the system are identified from which short term objectives are derived. The FMS recommended for immediate development encompasses the short term objectives for the welding, hardening, grinding and transfer processes of 8 <b>cutting</b> <b>cylinder</b> specifications. It is shown that the MIG (Argon/C 02) are welding, progressive flame hardening and wide-face cylindrical grinding processes can be developed successfully to automate cylinder production. The recommended system integrates these processes into an FMS through the'automatic handling of cylinders (through three process routes) by a robotic manipulator utilising a double gripper. 'A robotic welding station, manually loaded, is also recommended. ' The system is controlled overall by a 32 K microcontroller with the process machines individually controlled by programmahle logic controllers with up to 6 K of memory each. The economic appraisal of the FMS indicates a 4. 4 year payback based on direct labour and material cost savings.

6000|$|... § 7. An {{infinite}} number of different lines, more or less violent in curvature according to the measurements we adopt in designing them, are included, or defined, by each of the laws just explained. But the number of these laws themselves is also infinite. There is no limit to the multitude of conditions which may be invented, each producing a group of curves of a certain common nature. Some of these laws, indeed, produce single curves, which, like the circle, can vary only in size; but, for the most part, they vary also, like the lines we have just traced, in the rapidity of their curvature. Among these innumerable lines, however, there is one source of difference in character which divides them, infinite {{as they are in}} number, into two great classes. The first class consists of those which are limited in their course, either ending abruptly, or returning to some point from which they set out; the second class, of those lines whose nature is to proceed for ever into space. Any portion of a circle, for instance, is, by the law of its being, compelled, if it continue its course, to return to the point from which it set out; so also any portion of the oval curve (called an ellipse), produced by <b>cutting</b> a <b>cylinder</b> obliquely across. And if a single point be marked on the rim of a carriage wheel, this point, as the wheel rolls along the road, will trace a curve in the air from one part of the road to another, which is called a cycloid, and to which the law of its existence appoints that it shall always follow a similar course, and be terminated by the level line on which the wheel rolls. All such curves are of inferior beauty: and the curves which are incapable of being completely drawn, because, as in the two cases above given, the law of their being supposes them to proceed for ever into space, are of a higher beauty.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the noncircular {{cylinder}} becomes made {{practical use}} {{of as the}} workpiece of a noncircular gear, the shaft of power transmission, the output shaft of a linear motion actuator without rotation and the positive cam for generating a reciprocating motion. 　In this paper, two devices are newly developed for generating noncircular cylinders {{by means of the}} linear edged tool to be turning at high speed. The one is the device for generating the elliptic cylinder to which is applied such a kinematic principle that the straight line perpendicularly fixed on the coupler link of the revolving block slider crank mechanism envelops the ellipse. The other is the device for generating the polygonal cylinder to which is applied such a kinematic principle that the central line of the coupler slider of the reciprocating block double-slider crank mechanism turned round a point envelops the polygonal profile. 　The practical constructions of these device for <b>cutting</b> noncircular <b>cylinders</b> with acceptable accuracy are presented. The characteristics of the displacement and the velocity of the point of generation and those of influence coefficients are clarified. The condition for the driving gear of the elliptic cylinder generating device to make a continuous revolution, the maximum deviation of the angular displacement due to errors of kinematic constants and the condition for the polygonal profile to have cusps are formulated. 　As examples, elliptic cylinders whose lengths, major diameters and eccentricities are 140 mm, 48 mm and 0. 5 respectively and polygonal cylinders having two and three lobes whose lengths, diameters of circumscribed circles and ratios of distortion are 275 mm, 48 mm and 0. 0833 respectively have been cut by using each experimental device.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the thesis {{is the study of}} {{temperature}} effects on a concrete cylindrical structure representing the primary biological shield of a nuclear reactor. The study was carried out using a model of a simplified analogous structure formed by <b>cutting</b> the <b>cylinder</b> by two planes parallel to the same diameter and linking the two part by means of a slender cross-wall representing the action of the removed parts of the cylinder. The model was built at the Battersea College of Technology and the results of tests were compared with the results obtained by the author from the analysis of the scaled model of the prototype, a joint programme carried out by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and Taylor Woodrow Construction Ltd. The science of model testing was extended in this work to cover investigations of the effects of short terra temperature loading. The programme aimed at the development of a, simplified model as an inexpensive method of testing, development of an experimental technique and theoretical analysis which {{could be used as a}} "yard stick" in comparison between different tests or even different models. Comparison of results between the scaled model of the prototype (three dimensional model) and a simplified model and checking that the principle of superposition applies to the temperature loading was also sought. Some twenty tests were carried out on one of the three dimensional models but only part of one test was singled out for the comparison of results with the simplified model. The main work was carried out on the simplified model and, out of eighteen tests, one test was fully worked up in the form of tables and graphs showing the experimental and analytical approach in detail. The results of representatives of other groups of tests were shown in graphical form. The experimental technique is fully described pointing to the encountered difficulties. The successful development of a simplified model raises confidence that this approach could be extended to other types of structures...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a combined experimental and numerical program directed at defining a cost/effective methodology for conjugate heat transfer CFD simulations of engine water cooling jackets. As {{a first step}} in the process, deficiencies in current numerical strategies for the analysis of conjugate heat transfer problems under typical engine operating conditions are exposed and commented. Results are shown form a wide validation program based on the comparison between experimental measurements from a test facility at Villanova University and CFD predictions at the University of Modena. On the experimental side, the test apparatus consists of a test section, pump, accumulator tank, rejection heat exchanger and required pumping. The test section is provided with a constant volumetric flow rate, and consists of a cylindrical aluminum body with a drilled horizontal flow channel. The section is heated by ten cartridge heaters located at a constant radial distance from the cylinder axis. The test section is connected to the flow loop by means of two calming sections, respectively at the cylinder inlet and exit. Twenty thermocouples are used to measure the test section local temperature along a radial plane <b>cutting</b> the <b>cylinder.</b> Water / ethylene-glycol binary mixture and pure water are tested and compared during the experimental program, in order to reproduce a set of thermal situations {{as close as possible to}} actual engine cooling system operation. On the CFD side, an extensive program reproducing the experiments is carried out in order to assess the predictive capabilities of some of the most commonly used eddy viscosity models available in literature. Both non-evaporating and evaporating conditions are tested, showing severe limitations to the use of simplified boiling models to correctly capture the complex interaction between turbulent boundary layer and vapor bubble dynamics. In order to overcome the above stated deficiencies under boiling conditions, a methodology is then proposed to both improve the accuracy of the CFD forecasts and reduce the computational costs of the simulations. A few preliminary results from the validation process are shown and briefly discussed at the end of the paper...|$|R
40|$|As {{incredible}} as {{it might}} seem just below the sand dunes of Mauritania (at a depth of only 50 - 150 cm) there is natural moisture. A research worker at the the Institut des Regions Arides de Tunisie (Institute for the arid regions of Tunisia) has developed a simple method of reafforestation which makes use of this moisture. In a region with a rainfall of less than 300 mm per annum it would not appear possible for sand to remain moist. However, the explanation for the phenomenon is relatively simple. Since bare sands are poor conductors of heat, only the sand near the surface is heated and evaporation is thus limited. Furthermore, there is a layer of dry sand between the surface of the soil and the lower layer of residual moisture. This layer of dry sand acts as a protective mulch. It cuts off the flow through capillary action and, as a result, also prevents evaporation. The combined effect of these two phenomena demonstrates how sands without vegetation can preserve rainwater for several years. This mulch, or shallow layer of dry sand, can be 'broken'. All that is needed is a bottomless metal <b>cylinder</b> with a <b>cutting</b> edge. This <b>cylinder</b> is driven into the sand and then watered abundantly. The water is guided by the walls of the cylinder and flows straight down, thus restoring contact between the lower layer of moisture and the surface of the soil. The roots of young trees can begin their growth in the moistened section of the cylinder and subsequently reach the lower layer of residual moisture. As a result, they become self-supporting and do not require irrigation. Prosopis juliflora plants were established using this method seven years ago and are still alive, despite extremely low rainfall.
