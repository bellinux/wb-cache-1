The original {{side valve}} engine design featured a capacity of 696cc ( [...] 55mm x 77mm [...] ) giving a RAC rating of 7.2 hp, the cast cylinder block featured a detachable head and was mounted on an aluminium crankcase. The crankshaft used one roller and two ball bearings and the big-ends were splash lubricated. [...] Edge also carried out the design of other mechanical components such as the three speed gearbox and <b>clutch</b> <b>assembly.</b> Austin was largely responsible for styling the Seven's design, which was reportedly influenced by {{the design of the}} Peugeot Quadrilette.

Two prototype actuator and <b>clutch</b> <b>assemblies,</b> in continuous vacuum life test under load at 10 to the minus 8 th power torr for more than sixteen months, have each accumulated more than 34, 000 output revolutions without anomaly, the equivalent of more than seven years of operation in a 1000 km orbit or nearly ninety-five years at synchronous altitude...|$|R
50|$|THM400 {{transmissions}} {{are very}} popular in automotive competition due to their great strength. Much of this strength comes {{from the use of}} a cast iron center support to suspend the transmission's concentric shafts that join the <b>clutch</b> <b>assemblies</b> to the gear train. The center support, which is splined to the interior of the transmission's case, also provides a robust reaction point for first gear (the gear train's reaction carrier is restrained from counter-rotating the engine in first gear by a roller clutch whose inner race is part of the center support). Since the first gear reactive force is evenly distributed around the periphery of the case, the types of mechanical (and some times violent) failures that have plagued other competition transmissions are rare.|$|R

5000|$|... 2001 was {{the lowest}} {{production}} year for the Camaro with 29,009 units. This was partially due to production ending earlier than usual to begin work on the 35th Anniversary cars. The Z28 and SS models received the intake manifold from the LS6, the engine used in the fifth generation Corvette Z06 from 2001 to 2004 and the first generation Cadillac CTS-V from 2004 to 2005. This change also resulted in a revised camshaft profile and removal of the EGR system. GM also introduced a new slave cylinder for the <b>clutch</b> <b>assembly</b> that was superior {{to the design of}} previous years, as well as an LS6 clutch in manual models. Accordingly, stated power ratings were increased to [...] for the Z28 and [...] for the SS which also added a power steering cooler. SLP reintroduced the RS model this year, which included rally stripes and stock cold air intake system and Z28 take-off exhaust (from their SS conversions).|$|E
5000|$|Automatic and semi-automatics {{typically}} use a {{centrifugal clutch}} which operates {{in a different}} fashion. At idle, the engine is disconnected from the gearbox input shaft, allowing both it and the bike to freewheel (unlike torque converter automatics, there is no [...] "idle creep" [...] with a properly adjusted centrifugal clutch). As the throttle is opened and engine speed rises, counterweights attached to movable inner friction surfaces (connected to the engine shaft) within the <b>clutch</b> <b>assembly</b> are thrown gradually further outwards, until they start {{to make contact with}} the inside of the outer housing (connected to the gearbox shaft) and transmit an increasing amount of engine power. The effective [...] "bite point" [...] is found automatically by equilibrium where the power being transmitted through the (still-slipping) clutch is equal to what the engine can provide. This allows relatively fast full-throttle takeoffs (with the clutch adjusted so the engine will be turning near its maximum-torque rpm) without the engine slowing or bogging down, as well as more relaxed starts and low-speed maneuvers at lower throttle settings and rpms.|$|E
5000|$|In 1961 the Series IIIA was {{announced}} with the Series II Sunbeam Alpine [...] engine. Externally and internally the Series IIIA was {{identical to the}} Series III. The improvements were directed solely at improving the durability of the car. To this end, engine capacity was increased and a stiffer crankshaft fitted. To increase reliability, the crankshaft incorporated larger diameter connecting rod bearings which called for modifications to the connecting rods and gudgeon pins. Modified oil and water pumps completed the engine changes. As a result, power output increased from [...] to [...] at 5,100 rpm and torque increased from 84 lbft Nm at 3500 rpm to [...] at 3,900 rpm. In addition, the Series IIIA included many detail changes such as an increased diameter front anti-roll bar which greatly improved roadholding, a redesigned clutch bell housing, a revised <b>clutch</b> <b>assembly</b> with nine pressure springs instead of six and a redesigned air cleaner assembly. Inside the car a fresh-air heater, hitherto available only at extra cost, became a standard fitting. [...] All of these changes combined to make the Series IIIA subtly different from its predecessor and to give the Sunbeam Rapier a new lease {{of life in the}} showroom.|$|E

With the help of bifurcation diagrams, time domain response diagrams, phase plane diagrams, and Poincaré maps, the effects of the excitation frequency and the torsional stiffness of one-way clutch on the dynamic behavior of gear transmission system for one-way <b>clutch,</b> two-shaft <b>assembly</b> are investigated in detail by using Runge-Kutta method. Numerical results reveal that the system response involves period- 1 motion, multiperiodic motion, bifurcation, and chaotic motion. Large torsional stiffness of one-way clutch can increase the impact and lead to instability in the system. The results can present a useful source of reference for technicians and engineers for dynamic design and vibration control of such system...|$|R

All three demonstrators were outshopped from La Grange in mid-1992. They bore no {{resemblance}} to the pre-GP series EMD BL1 and BL2 models of the late 1940s. Neither did they resemble GP9s, at least not from the frame up. On the inside, the unit married the technology of two generations, with a rebuilt 16-567C engine crankcase with 645 power assemblies. An EMD turbocharger was applied {{in place of the}} normal Roots blower, but it did not have a <b>clutch</b> <b>assembly.</b> It could not free wheel as a normal EMD turbocharger does. It was coupled to the engine gear train over the entire throttle range. The combination of the [...] "turbo blower", 645 power assemblies and an increase in engine speed to 900 rpm boosted the output from [...] mated to an AR10 alternator and Dash 2 electrical system. Although the GP9 frame, trucks, traction motors, fans and prime mover were rebuilt and reused, the locomotive received an all-new cab and carbody, basically that of a standard second-generation GP. Still, the unit had an unmistakable appearance, due to the absence of inertial air intakes behind the engineer's side of the cab, and the use of a squared-off dynamic brake assembly similar to that of a GP60.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{automatic}} transmission using hydraulic fluid {{was developed in}} 1932 by two Brazilian engineers, José Braz Araripe and Fernando Lehly Lemos; Later, the prototype and the project were sold to General Motors, who introduced the technology in the 1940 Oldsmobile model as a [...] "Hydra-Matic" [...] transmission. However, an article published by the Wall Street Journal credits the German auto parts company ZF Friedrichshafen for the invention, which would have occurred shortly after World War I. In 1934, both REO and General Motors developed semi-{{automatic transmission}}s that were less difficult to operate than a fully manual unit. These designs, however, continued to use a clutch to engage the engine with the transmission. The General Motors unit, dubbed the [...] "Automatic Safety Transmission," [...] was notable in that it employed a power-shifting planetary gearbox that was hydraulically controlled and was sensitive to road speed, anticipating future development. Parallel to the development in the 1930s of an automatically shifting gearbox was Chrysler's work on adapting the fluid coupling to automotive use. Invented early in the 20th century, the fluid coupling was {{the answer to the}} question of how to avoid stalling the engine when the vehicle was stopped with the transmission in gear. Chrysler itself never used the fluid coupling with any of its automatic transmissions, but did use it in conjunction with a hybrid manual transmission called [...] "Fluid Drive" [...] (the similar Hy-Drive used a torque converter). These developments in automatic gearbox and fluid coupling technology eventually culminated in the introduction in 1939 of the General Motors Hydra-Matic, the world's first mass-produced automatic transmission. Available as an option on 1940 Oldsmobiles and later Cadillacs, the Hydra-Matic combined a fluid coupling with three hydraulically controlled planetary gearsets to produce four forward speeds plus reverse. The transmission was sensitive to engine throttle position and road speed, producing fully automatic up- and down-shifting that varied according to operating conditions. The Hydra-Matic was subsequently adopted by Cadillac and Pontiac, and was sold to various other automakers, including Bentley, Hudson, Kaiser, Nash, and Rolls-Royce. It also found use during World War II in some military vehicles. From 1950 to 1954, Lincoln cars were also available with the Hydra-Matic. Mercedes-Benz subsequently devised a four-speed fluid coupling transmission that was similar in principle to the Hydra-Matic, but of a different design. Interestingly, the original Hydra-Matic incorporated two features which are widely emulated in today's transmissions. The Hydra-Matic's ratio spread through the four gears produced excellent [...] "step-off" [...] and acceleration in first, good spacing of intermediate gears, and the effect of an overdrive in fourth, by virtue of the low numerical rear axle ratio used in the vehicles of the time. In addition, in third and fourth gear, the fluid coupling only handled a portion of the engine's torque, resulting in a high degree of efficiency. In this respect, the transmission's behavior was similar to modern units incorporating a lock-up torque converter. In 1956, GM introduced the [...] "Jetaway" [...] Hydra-Matic, which was different in design than the older model. Addressing the issue of shift quality, which was an ongoing problem with the original Hydra-Matic, the new transmission utilized two fluid couplings, the primary one that linked the transmission to the engine, and a secondary one that replaced the <b>clutch</b> <b>assembly</b> that controlled the forward gearset in the original. The result was much smoother shifting, especially from first to second gear, but with a loss in efficiency and an increase in complexity. Another innovation for this new style Hydra-Matic was the appearance of a Park position on the selector. The original Hydra-Matic, which continued in production until the mid-1960s, still used the reverse position for parking pawl engagement. The first torque converter automatic, Buick's Dynaflow, was introduced for the 1948 model year. It was followed by Packard's Ultramatic in mid-1949 and Chevrolet's Powerglide for the 1950 model year. Each of these transmissions had only two forward speeds, relying on the converter for additional torque multiplication. In the early 1950s, BorgWarner developed a series of three-speed torque converter automatics for American Motors, Ford Motor Company, Studebaker, and several other manufacturers in the US and other countries. Chrysler was late in developing its own true automatic, introducing the two-speed torque converter PowerFlite in 1953, and the three-speed TorqueFlite in 1956. The latter was the first to utilize the Simpson compound planetary gearset. General Motors produced multiple-turbine torque converters from 1954 to 1961. These included the Twin-Turbine Dynaflow and the triple-turbine Turboglide transmissions. The shifting took place in the torque converter, rather than through pressure valves and changes in planetary gear connections. Each turbine was connected to the drive shaft through a different gear train. These phased from one ratio to another according to demand, rather than shifting. The Turboglide actually had two speed ratios in reverse, with one of the turbines rotating backwards. By the late 1960s, most of the fluid-coupling four-speed and two-speed transmissions had disappeared in favor of three-speed units with torque converters. Also around this time, whale oil was removed from automatic transmission fluid. By the early 1980s, these were being supplemented and eventually replaced by overdrive-equipped transmissions providing four or more forward speeds. Many transmissions also adopted the lock-up torque converter (a mechanical clutch locking the torque converter pump and turbine together to eliminate slip at cruising speed) to improve fuel economy. As computerized engine control units (ECUs) became more capable, much of the logic built into the transmission's valve body was offloaded to the ECU. Some manufacturers use a separate computer dedicated to the transmission called a transmission control unit (TCU), also known as the transmission control module (TCM), which shares information with the engine management computer. In this case, solenoids turned on and off by the computer control shift patterns and gear ratios, rather than the spring-loaded valves in the valve body. This allows for more precise control of shift points, shift quality, lower shift times, and (on some newer cars) semi-automatic control, where the driver tells the computer when to shift. The result is an impressive combination of efficiency and smoothness. Some computers even identify the driver's style and adapt to best suit it.|$|E

25|$|The {{internal}} combustion engine drives two clutch packs. The outer clutch pack drives gears 1, 3, 5 (and 7 when fitted), and reverse — the outer clutch pack has a larger diameter compared to the inner clutch, and can therefore handle greater torque loadings. The inner clutch pack drives gears 2, 4, and 6. Instead of a standard large dry single-plate clutch, each clutch pack for the six-speed DSG {{is a collection of}} four small wet interleaved clutch plates (similar to a motorcycle wet multi-plate clutch). Due to space constraints, the two <b>clutch</b> <b>assemblies</b> are concentric, and the shafts within the gearbox are hollow and also concentric. Because the alternate clutch pack's gear-sets can be pre-selected (predictive shifts enabled via the unloaded section of the gearbox), un-powered time while shifting is avoided because the transmission of torque is simply switched from one clutch-pack to the other. This means that the DSG takes only about 8milliseconds to upshift. In comparison, the sequential manual transmission (SMT) in the Ferrari F430 Scuderia takes 60milliseconds to shift, or 150milliseconds in the Ferrari Enzo. The quoted time for upshifts is the time the wheels are completely non-powered.|$|R

In the UK, the R1200GS has been subject to various DVSA vehicle recalls covering the front brakes, anti-lock braking system, throttle cable, fuel pump, <b>clutch,</b> final drive <b>assembly,</b> brake pipes, and gearbox; and similar recalls have been issued in other countries. Early journalistic reports described the bike as having a front end [...] "head shake" [...] or speed wobble, and deliveries of the motorcycle were halted while BMW revised the front end geometry.|$|R
50|$|The Saab Monster was an {{experimental}} car made by Saab in 1959. This project {{was part of}} Saab's work in motorsport {{and the need to}} derive more power from their two-stroke powerplant. It consisted of a 'Toreador Red' Saab 93 with all excess weight removed, including the bonnet, which was replaced by a plastic one. The engineers then installed two transverse 748 cc two-stroke, three cylinder engines, in a 'split in-line' configuration, driving the front wheels through a modified <b>clutch</b> and gearbox <b>assembly.</b> There were two distributors and an enlarged radiator.|$|R
