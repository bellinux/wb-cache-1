5|$|At this time, Li Yuan's {{infantry}} began arriving, {{with the}} van division deploying {{in a square}} to fend off a Sui attack while the other two divisions were <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> it. Wen Daya's account now becomes sketchier, indicating that the infantry charged the Sui army, at which point Li Yuan's sons led the cavalry around the Sui flank towards the town, where the small garrison left behind by Song Laosheng was forced to drop the portcullis gates. Li Yuan then let spread the rumour that Song Laosheng had been killed, which demoralized the Sui force. The Sui army began to retreat, but this turned into a rout when they found their retreat to Huoyi cut off by Li Yuan's cavalry and the barred gates. Wen Daya's narrative can be supplemented by the later account, which, despite its bias regarding Li Shimin, also contains indications that not everything went according to Li Yuan's plans: it appears {{that in the first}} clash between Li Yuan's infantry and the Sui army, the Sui had the upper hand and pushed Li Yuan back, possibly because he had not yet managed to bring all his forces into the field. Either through the arrival of the rest of Li Yuan's infantry, the actions of Li Yuan's cavalry along and behind the Sui flanks, or Li Yuan's stratagem, the Sui army's morale gave way abruptly, and their resistance collapsed.|$|E
25|$|Charles marched by Bridgnorth, Lichfield and Ashbourne to Doncaster, {{where on}} 18 August he {{was met by}} great numbers of Yorkshire gentlemen with {{promises}} of fresh recruits. For a moment the outlook was bright, for the Derbyshire men with Gell were far away at Worcester with Leven, the Yorkshire Parliamentarians engaged in besieging Scarborough and Pontefract castles and other posts. But two days later he heard that David Leslie with the cavalry of Leven's army was <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> him, and that, the Yorkshire sieges being now ended, Major-General Poyntz's force lay in his front. It was now impossible {{to wait for the}} new levies, and reluctantly the King turned back to Oxford, raiding Huntingdonshire (the home county of Oliver Cromwell) {{and other parts of the}} hated Eastern Association en route.|$|E
25|$|On 23 March, Wintzingerode with 8,000 cavalry and 40 guns arrived near Vitry-le-François while Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov with Wintzingerode's {{infantry}} plus Langeron and Sacken were <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind.</b> Yorck and Kleist reached Château-Thierry. After a captured French message {{indicated that}} Napoleon was at Saint-Dizier, the Allies decided to merge their two armies and go after Napoleon with 200,000 troops. With the French emperor already blocking their supply line to Germany, the Allies determined {{to establish a}} new line from the Netherlands to Laon. At Bar-sur-Aube, Emperor Francis I of Austria was warned to leave for Dijon. Francis fled to safety with the Austrian Army of the South a few hours ahead of the French cavalry. On the evening of 23 March, a message from Napoleon's Chief of Police Anne Jean Marie René Savary was intercepted by Friedrich Karl von Tettenborn's Cossacks. It stated that {{there was nothing in the}} arsenals and treasury at Paris and that the city's increasingly restive population was demanding peace. More information arrived from Napoleon's enemies in Paris.|$|E

25|$|On 8 February 1814, Bellegarde and Eugene clashed in the Battle of the Mincio River. After Eugene {{threw the}} bulk of his army across the Mincio River, he bumped into the Austrian left wing. The French array was drawn up with Quesnel's {{division}} on the left, Rouyer's division on the right, Marcognet and the Italian Guard in reserve, and cavalry on the flanks. After brisk fighting, Quesnel's soldiers cleared the Austrians out of the village of Pozzolo. As the Franco-Italians pressed their enemies north toward Valeggio sul Mincio and Borghetto, Eugene sent Quesnel and Rouyer to the left and brought Marcognet into the front line. Meanwhile, Bellegarde and the Austrian right wing crossed the Mincio near Borghetto and were overpowering Verdier's weak left wing. When they found Eugene's main body <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> them, Bellegarde's Austrians fell back in confusion. The Franco-Italians counted 3,000 killed and wounded and 500 captured out of 34,000 men engaged. Austrian casualties numbered 2,800 killed and wounded plus 1,200 captured out of 32,000. At Pozzolo the Austrian grenadier brigade was mauled, suffering 790 casualties. In Quesnel's division, Campi's brigade included one battalion each of the 1st Light, 14th Light, and 10th Line, as well as three battalions of the 92nd Line. Forestier's brigade had three battalions of the 84th Line and one battalion of the 35th Line.|$|E

2500|$|The {{casualties}} {{among the}} colonists were few. John Winthrop was quoted saying, [...] " [...] <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> the bushes very near our men... shot many arrows into their hats, sleeves and stocks, yet (which {{was a very}} miracle) not one of ours was wounded." [...] Mason's account supported this, saying that [...] "several were found slain," [...] a reference to them being injured.|$|E
60|$|He rose {{up in the}} sleigh, and {{attempted}} to look around; and his fear was suddenly changed into terror, at seeing a large black animal, like a bear, <b>coming</b> furiously <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> them, bounding over the snow. Josey screamed aloud.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1904, both boats {{wanted to be the}} first one of the season to arrive in Hazelton.

6000|$|... “There is a sail <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> from <b>behind.</b> She {{looks to}} me close-hauled.

But nobody bothered to pick up the bits they were left. You know we were there we were the masters we were the bosses and whatever we did was right... Well you know you don't want him any more.

2500|$|The Green Bay Packers {{won over}} the visiting Arizona Cardinals {{at home as}} running backs Ahman Green and Vernand Morency each rushed for over 100yards, {{becoming}} the first Packers running back duo to accomplish that feat since the 1980s. Brett Favre threw for 180yards and one touchdown, {{as well as one}} rushing touchdown. [...] Leading Green Bay's receiving corps was Donald Driver, who had five receptions for 58Yards. <b>Coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>behind</b> him was David Martin, who had four receptions for 48Yards and one touchdown. [...] On defense, the Packers limited Cardinals rookie quarterback Matt Leinart to 14/35 for 157yards with one touchdown and one interception. [...] They also held Cardinals running back Edgerrin James to 84 rushing yards on 24 carries, along with three receptions for 25 receiving yards.

6000|$|Bob, {{wondering}} as he {{went along}} at the astounding change that had come over his companion, took fifty long steps; then he heard a shout of [...] "Now!"

6000|$|The {{man went}} off to do as he was directed. At that moment, Evan Meredith, <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> from <b>behind</b> on Harry's cob, called out lightly, [...] "Can I help you, Edie?

60|$|The {{motion was}} smooth and easy now.

50|$|In December 2009, {{more than}} 100 firefighters tackled {{a fire at}} the Afan Lido after a blaze broke out at the pool.

6000|$|Between the Palace and the market-place {{there was}} a narrow street of flagged stone, which was busy during {{the early part of}} the day but deserted after sundown.

So absorbed was the man in {{something}} which he was writing on the stones that he did not hear John's approach, and the latter, <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> from <b>behind</b> was enabled to see over his shoulder.

500|$|FreeSpace 2s key {{attraction}} is its dogfights. CNN.com said the close-ranged dogfights make for engrossing, and exciting skirmishes. FiringSquad {{described it as}} a [...] "total thrill" [...] to be among 20 fighters flying in between opposing capital ships with beams, missiles, and flak all around and warnings going off, as they try to seek out and destroy their opposite numbers, a view which GameSpot agreed with. The game's AI was judged adequate to provide for such fights, being cunning enough to trick others to crash into the walls of narrow openings, and good enough to detect and warn their wingmen of enemies <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> directly <b>behind</b> them. There are those who expressed minor disappointments with the AI tending to collide too often with other objects. While the dynamic mission objectives were celebrated for <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with twists and turns to spice up the story, there were a few who found these [...] "in-game red herrings" [...] overused instead.|$|R

Slowly Mount Royal gained on Hazelton. Captain Bonser was having none of it and he rammed Mount Royal several times. Johnson lost control and the current carried her back downstream, bow first. Bonser wagged Hazelton’s stern at Mount Royal, tooted the whistle and continued triumphantly upstream. Furious, Johnson left the pilothouse unattended to retrieve a rifle and shot at the departing Hazelton. Afterwards, Johnson laid charges on Bonser claiming he deliberately rammed Mount Royal. Bonser claimed in his defense that it was an accident.|$|R
