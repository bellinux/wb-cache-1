50|$|Electric motors {{experience}} losses due to hysteresis and {{eddy currents}} {{set up in}} the iron core of the motor. These are proportional to the frequency of the current. Since the harmonics are at higher frequencies, they produce higher core losses in a motor than the power frequency would. This results in increased heating of the motor core, which (if excessive) can shorten the life of the motor. The 5th harmonic causes a CEMF (<b>counter</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>force)</b> in large motors which acts in the opposite direction of rotation. The CEMF is not large enough to counteract the rotation, however it does play a small role in the resulting rotating speed of the motor.|$|E
40|$|Regenerative braking is a {{function}} to recharge power bank on the Plug-in electric vehicles (PHEV) and electric vehicles (EV). The weakness of this system is, it can only perform its function when the vehicle is slowing down or by stepping the brake foot pedal. In other words, the electricity recharging system is inconsistent, non-continuous and geography dependent. To overcome {{the weakness of the}} regenerative braking system, it is suggested that to apply another generator {{which is going to be}} parallel with the regenerative braking system so that continuous charging can be achieved. Since the ironless electricity generator has a less <b>counter</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> (CEMF) comparing to an ironcored electricity generator and no cogging torque. Applying the ironless electricity generator parallel to the regenerative braking system is seen one of the options which creates sustainable charging system compared to cored electricity generator...|$|E
40|$|The sliding mode {{control has}} the merits {{with respect to the}} {{variation}} of the disturbance and robustness. In this paper, the sensorless sliding-mode observer with least mean squared error approach for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) to detect the rotor position by <b>counter</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> and then compute motor speed is designed and implemented. In addition, the neural network control is also used to compensate the PI gain tuning to increase the speed accuracy without regarding the errors of the current measurement and motor noise. In this paper, a digital signal processor TMS 320 F 2812 utilizes its high-speed ADC module to get current feedback information and thus to estimate the rotor position and takes advantage of the built-in modules to achieve SVPWM current control so that the senseless speed control will be accomplished. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed control system will be verified from the experimental results...|$|E

40|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{recognized}} that the <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> (emf) can be induced just by the spin precession where the generation of the <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> has been considered as a real-space topological pumping effect. It {{has been shown that}} the amount of the <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> is independent of the functionality of the localized moments. It was also demonstrated that the rigid domain wall (DW) motion cannot generate <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> in the system. Based on real-space topological pumping approach in the current study we show that the <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> can be induced by rigid motion of a deformed DW. We also demonstrate that the generated <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> strongly depends on the DW bulging.

40|$|According to Maxwell’s theory, the {{displacement}} current in vacuum can produce <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> on conducting current. However, {{the displacement}} current in vacuum does not experience <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> from conducting current. The asymmetrical <b>electromotive</b> <b>forces</b> result in non-conserved energy transmission between any two coils involving displacement current and conducting current.

40|$|The {{standard}} magnet-coil {{driving system}} in resonant column devices provides the required cyclic excitation; however, it inherently produces a <b>counter</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> that opposes the motion. In this study, the resonant column is modeled as an electro-mechanical system to quantitatively examine the counter electromotive effect {{and to explore}} its effect on resonant frequency and damping ratio computed from voltagebased measurements. The model is verified with two independent sets of experiments. Experimental and analytical {{results show that the}} measurement bias is more pronounced on the damping ratio than on the resonant frequency, the damping bias is not a device constant but varies with frequency, and the error is particularly relevant in low-loss and low-stiffness specimens (such as dry sands at low confinement). The electro-mechanical model permits developing device-specific correction charts {{that can be used to}} reexamine previously published damping ratio data gathered with voltage-based resonant column procedures...|$|E
40|$|The {{generator}} {{that normally}} {{used in the}} market, which is the iron-cored electricity generator has high cogging and starting torques. By redesigning of the iron-cored electricity generator, Axial-flux Permanent Magnet (AFPM) configuration minimizes the usage of ferrite material. AFPM, one of the coreless electricity generator configuration has a less <b>counter</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> (CEMF) compare to the cored electricity generator. AFPM configuration also has no cogging torque and low starting torque. Application of a coreless electricity generator is the most suitable compare to the cored electricity generator. However, {{it is expected that}} the elimination of the ferrite material within the coreless electricity generator itself increases the power generation. The configuration is the ironless electricity generator. This paper presents the design and analysis of the AFPM ironless electricity generator. There are two main parameters present in this paper, different number of turns of coil per phase and distance between a pair of the magnet. The result of the analysis shows that when the coil turns per phase increased, the voltage output and magnetic flux within the coil also increased. While increasing the distance between the magnets, the voltage output, and magnetic flux within the coil decreases...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate how the onboard battery of a quadcopter can be charged through manual rotation of its motors, while understanding the resulting aerodynamical forces acting on the rotors during hover, as well as considering the changes in thrust capabilities when the electronic and structural design are altered. A theoretical approach using the momentum theory will present a general understanding of rotor performance whilst describing the correlation between rotor parameters, thrust and mechanical power. Furthermore, {{the idea of using}} the motors as generators are put under study to investigate their electrical output and utilize them to recharge the battery. This is done using the <b>counter</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> equation, and a sequence of other equations that will present numerical data of actual manual work converted into electrical power. Resulting in the required time to manually recharge the quadcopter subsequently sustaining hover flight for three minutes. It is concluded in this report that manual recharging of the battery using the motors as generators is possible, as well as maintaining its flying ability in case of added weight. Although not deemed practical in commercial use, it is a new methodology with the intention to develop a sustainable quadcopter further expanding its practical applications in both aviation industry and human aid...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of frequency dispersion of conductivity (induced polarization) of rocks {{on the results}} of electromagnetic (EM) sounding was studied on the basis of calculation of electric field of vertical magnetic dipole above horizontally layered polarizable sections. Frequency dispersion was approximated by the Debye formula. Polarizable homogeneous halfspace, two, three and multilayered sections were analyzed in frequency and time domains. The calculations for different values of chargeability and time constants of polarization were performed. In the far zone of a source, the IP of rocks led to quasi-wave phenomena. They produced rapid fluctuations of frequency and transient sounding curves (interference phenomena, multireflections in polarizable layers). In the case of transient sounding in the near zone of a source quasistatic distortions prevailed, caused by the <b>counter</b> <b>electromotive</b> <b>force</b> arising in polarizable layers which may lead to strong changes in transient curves. In some cases quasiwave and quasistatic phenomena made EM sounding curves non-interpretable in the class of quasistationary curves over non-dispersive sections. On the other hand, they could increase the resolution and depth of investigation of EM sounding. This was confirmed by an experience of "high-resolution" electroprospecting in Russia. The problem of interpretation of EM sounding data in polarizable sections is nonunique. To achieve uniqueness it is probably necessary to complement them by soundings of other type...|$|E
