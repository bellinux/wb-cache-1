5|$|Haunting Ground is a {{survival}} horror game with similar gameplay elements to Clock Tower 3 (2002). The player controls Fiona Belli directly and gives commands to her canine companion, Hewie. Fiona can run and perform a backstep maneuver, {{both of which}} reduce stamina. She can also crouch down to hide from enemy pursuers. Fiona <b>can</b> <b>kick</b> and tackle enemies as well, but tackling also reduces stamina. Losing too much stamina will result in Fiona becoming exhausted, causing her movements to slow down or possibly stop altogether. Exhaustion can be revived with certain items or with time. Fiona can interact with the environment by checking items, opening doors, and climbing ladders. The player can utilize hiding spots to evade pursuers. Other areas act as retaliation points that allow Fiona to use her environment to counterattack against her enemy, although some of these locations can only be used once.|$|E
5|$|Each level casts {{players as}} a {{different}} colored Yoshi, who must escort Baby Mario {{on his back}} and reach the end of the level, where he is passed on to the next Yoshi. Similar to Super Mario World, Yoshi can use his tongue to ensnare enemies and put them into his mouth. When something is in his mouth, Yoshi can either spit it out as an attack, or swallow it to turn it into an egg. These eggs can then be thrown at an angle, even bouncing off walls, to attack enemies or reach far away or hard to reach items. Yoshi can carry up to six eggs at a time, with some colored eggs spawning items once they hit something. Yoshi can also eat watermelons that let him spit out seeds, or flaming enemies that let him spit out fire. Yoshi is also able to perform a flutter jump, in which he <b>can</b> <b>kick</b> his legs in mid-air to gain extra height or hover over long distances, and a ground pound, a downward attack that can hammer down on enemies and stumps.|$|E
25|$|In combat, Frodo {{has access}} to three melee weapons at {{different}} stages in the game. Initially, he is armed with a walking stick. Later, he acquires a dagger, and finally, he can use the short sword Sting. Frodo can also throw stones, and can turn invisible for limited periods of time by using the One Ring. Aragorn is initially armed with a basic longsword, but later acquires Andúril. He also possesses a bow, and he <b>can</b> <b>kick</b> out at enemies. Gandalf uses his sword Glamdring and has several magical abilities, such as a fire attack, chain lightning and healing. The player can also switch to first-person view {{at any time during}} the game. This can help targeting when Frodo is throwing stones or Aragorn is firing arrows. Movement during first-person view is limited to strafing left and right.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kicks</b> <b>can</b> only be on {{the last}} tackle, and the ball <b>can</b> only be <b>kicked</b> once. It cannot be hacked on or dribbled, nor <b>can</b> it be <b>kicked</b> {{for a second time}} after being regathered.|$|R

The video, aimed at young people, is called [...] "The <b>Can</b> <b>Kicks</b> Back," [...] a {{reference}} to the tendencies of members of Congress to forever [...] "kick the can down the road" [...] in order to avoid making difficult decisions about lowering the nation's ballooning debt.

If younger Americans do not take heed, Simpson says, [...] "These old coots will clean out the Treasury before you get there." ...|$|R
25|$|The main {{gameplay}} {{differences between}} the two characters is that Ray is stronger and slower than Thomas; he cannot jump as high, but he <b>can</b> <b>kick</b> heavy obstacles out of his way and take more damage from enemy fire. He cannot aim as far as Thomas, but he is faster with six shooters, which he can dual wield, and is quicker when aiming at nearby enemies. Thomas can move faster than Ray, and can also grip onto ledges and pull himself up. He has a better long range aim than Ray, but is slower when using six shooters, which he can only single wield, and when aiming at nearby enemies. Ray can use two weapons unavailable to Thomas - a dismountable gatling gun and throwable dynamite. Thomas can use three weapons Ray cannot - a lasso, a bow and arrow and throwing knives. Weapons common to both characters include various types of six shooters, rifles and shotguns. Both characters can also can start fires by throwing or shooting oil lamps. They are also both capable of using chairs in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the style}} of play for both {{characters}} is slightly different, controlling each character is broadly similar. Each can move forward and backward, can strafe left and right, can run, walk, sneak, and jump. Each shares an identical HUD, with the same information available to the player; currently held weapons, ammo count, a compass with objectives marked, and current health points. Both characters can single and/or dual wield six shooters, or single wield other weapons, such as rifles. Both characters can also lean {{to the left and}} right without moving from their current position, and can interact with certain objects, such as health pick-ups (in the Xbox 360 version, health automatically regenerates over time), ammo and dropped weaponry. The main differences between the two characters is that Ray is stronger and slower, he cannot jump as high as Billy, but he <b>can</b> <b>kick</b> heavy obstacles out of his way and take considerably more damage from enemy fire. Billy can move faster than Ray and is quieter, allowing him to sneak up on enemies. He can also grip onto ledges and pull himself up. Billy can also use two weapons Ray cannot - a whip, and a bow and arrow.|$|E
25|$|When {{the ball}} crosses the {{sideline}} during general play a line-out is formed {{with the team}} that did not put the ball into touch throwing it in, unless it was kicked into touch from a penalty kick, {{in which case the}} team kicking to touch throws in. If the ball is kicked directly (does not bounce first) over the sideline by a team member who is outside his 22-metre line, the line-out is formed on the sideline perpendicular to where that player kicked it. The same rule applies if the ball is moved (passed, knocked, kicked or run) back inside the 22 by a player from the same team as the kicker. Once a tackle, scrum, line-out, ruck or maul occurs inside the 22 or the ball is moved there by the opposition a player <b>can</b> <b>kick</b> it directly into touch with the line-out forming where the ball crossed the sideline. If the ball bounces before crossing the sideline or is carried across by a player the line-out is formed where the ball crossed the line. However, a line-out can never take place within five metres of the ingoal area, and is always moved back to a mark five metres out.|$|E
50|$|Every kick is both {{an attack}} and defence, with legs being used to check {{incoming}} kicks or {{to take the initiative}} in striking through before a more circular <b>kick</b> <b>can</b> land. <b>Kicks</b> are delivered in one movement directly from the stance without chambering/cocking.|$|R
50|$|Swimmers of all ability can use them. Young {{swimmers}} <b>can</b> {{develop their}} <b>kicking</b> action while elite swimmers <b>can</b> refine their <b>kick.</b> They {{are also used}} to strengthen a swimmers legs.|$|R
25|$|When threatened, common {{ostriches}} run away, {{but they}} can cause serious injury and death with kicks from their powerful legs. Their legs <b>can</b> only <b>kick</b> forward.|$|R
25|$|There are {{two main}} {{exceptions}} to the normal laws regarding line-outs. One is a line-out following a penalty {{and the other is}} the quick throw-in. If a team is awarded a penalty they have the option of kicking the ball into touch for a line-out. They <b>can</b> <b>kick</b> the ball directly into touch from anywhere on the field and the line-out will take place where the ball crossed the line. They also get to throw the ball in at the line-out. A quick throw in occurs when a player throws the ball in before the line-out has had a chance to form. The ball can be thrown in anywhere from where the ball crossed the sideline to the players own goal line. The same ball that went into touch must be used and if the ball has touched another person (not including the person throwing it in, but including other players, replacements, spectators, coaching staff or anyone else not involved in the game) or a line-out has formed (two players from each team) then a quick throw in can not be taken. The ball must travel five metres before it is touches the ground or a player and can only be thrown in straight or backwards.|$|E
500|$|The male is {{protective}} of his territory but allows females {{to pass through}} the domain to forage. Males visit female home ranges at breeding time. Although generally tranquil, the okapi <b>can</b> <b>kick</b> and butt with its head to show aggression. As the vocal cords are poorly developed, vocal communication is mainly restricted to three sounds — [...] "chuff" [...] (contact calls used by both sexes), [...] "moan" [...] (by females during courtship) and [...] "bleat" [...] (by infants under stress). Individuals may engage in Flehmen response, a visual expression in which the animal curls back its upper lips, displays the teeth and inhales through the mouth for a few seconds. The leopard is the main predator of the okapi.|$|E
500|$|In 1981 Daniel Dennett had {{formulated}} another {{argument against}} the LOT. Dennett suggested that it would seem, {{on the basis of}} the evidence of our behavior toward computers but also with regard to some of our own unconscious behavior, that explicit representation is not necessary for the explanation of propositional attitudes. During a game of chess with a computer program, we often attribute such attitudes to the computer, saying such things as [...] "It thinks that the queen should be moved to the left." [...] We attribute propositional attitudes to the computer and this helps us to explain and predict its behavior in various contexts. Yet no one would suggest that the computer is actually thinking or believing somewhere inside its circuits the equivalent of the propositional attitude [...] "I believe I <b>can</b> <b>kick</b> this guy's butt" [...] in Mentalese. The same is obviously true, suggests Dennett, of many of our everyday automatic behaviors such as [...] "desiring to breathe clear air" [...] in a stuffy environment.|$|E

500|$|In September 2012, Tomlinson {{signed a}} four-month {{contract}} with Burton Albion, having previously been on trial at Preston North End. He joined the [...] "Brewers" [...] after manager Gary Rowett was {{dissatisfied with the}} performances of Ross Atkins and Dean Lyness. After keeping a clean sheet on his debut, in a 1–0 win over Rochdale at Spotland on 8 September, assistant manager Kevin Summerfield said that [...] "the biggest difference for me {{was that we were}} playing the game in their half and they were defending corners because he [...] <b>can</b> <b>kick</b> the ball so far up the pitch". He was aiming for a longer stay at the Pirelli Stadium, but a knee injury sustained in a home draw with former club Port Vale left him sidelined for up to six months. He recovered to full fitness in half that time, and signed a new contract in February to extend his stay at Burton until summer 2014. Burton reached the play-offs {{at the end of the}} 2012–13 season, but were defeated 5–4 by Bradford City at the semi-final stage. Tomlinson retired in July 2013 after surgeons advised him that scar tissue damage and a tear in his anterior cruciate ligament meant that his left knee was in poor shape and was vulnerable to further damage.|$|E
500|$|A {{scientist}} {{studying the}} Kaiju. Day stated: [...] "Certainly myself and Burn Gorman provide {{a little bit}} of much needed levity, it's a break from the monsters and the guys fighting. But then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk and it becomes a little more action oriented and a little more horror movie-esque. So, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real… the rest of these guys, they look really good in their suits and they've got abs, they <b>can</b> <b>kick</b> and fight and punch. Newt is sort of the 'everyman' and he's flawed and he's arrogant." [...] Del Toro gave Geiszler the mentality of a celebrity chef, with tattoos and a [...] "big personality". According to the director, Day was cast based on his performance in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: [...] "He comes out with a stick, and he has a monologue about what it is to hunt the rats in the basement. It was very funny, but he was coming from character. He was not doing big stuff, he was, like, really mourning and lamenting his job, you know, how inhuman it is. And I thought, 'This guy is great at shading and comedy.' There are moments in the movie where he delivers them both." [...] Trek Buccino portrays Geiszler as a child.|$|E
500|$|Having been {{released}} by Stevenage {{at the end}} of the 2010–11 season, Odubade signed for Conference National side Gateshead on 7 June 2011. He joined Gateshead on a free transfer, signing for the club alongside Eddie Odhiambo; the two had previously played alongside each other at Oxford United, Stevenage, and Newport County. On joining Gateshead, Odubade said [...] "I have parted company with Stevenage on good terms and this is now a new chapter for me. Gateshead is a good club that is moving in the right direction and I'm sure we <b>can</b> <b>kick</b> on next season. I don't look back with any regrets as things happen for a reason. I am always looking forward. Gateshead is a new challenge for me and I can only see good things coming from it". He made his Gateshead debut on 13 August 2011 in the club's 3–2 away win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough, assisting Kris Gate's goal in the 80th minute. Odubade scored his first goal for Gateshead three days later at Gateshead International Stadium in Gateshead's 3–0 win against Mansfield Town, which was voted Goal of the Season in the club's end of season awards. His first season at Gateshead was disrupted by two-foot injuries midway through the campaign, with Odubade breaking his metatarsal bone on two occasions, subsequently missing a total of 18 games. Despite the injuries, he made 34 appearances throughout the season, scoring seven times. He signed a one-year contract extension with Gateshead in May 2012.|$|E

50|$|In the Canadian game, {{the drop}} <b>kick</b> <b>can</b> be {{attempted}} {{at any time}} by either team.

500|$|Along the way, players pick up many items {{which will}} help Kuros along his way. Acorns, torches, and {{treasure}} chests contain objects for players to collect. Chests are color-coded and require a key of that matching color to open the chest; the same color-coded keys are used to open doors of matching colors. Some weapons and magic items are replaced once the player collects a new item, but others remain {{throughout the course of}} the game. Items include the following: [...] "Boots of Force" [...] which <b>can</b> <b>kick</b> open chests and doors; magical potions which temporarily grant Kuros invulnerability, extra speed, or extra jumping ability; gems to help bribe the end-of-level guardian; a shield to protect from enemy attacks; the [...] "Potion of Levitation" [...] which allows Kuros to float upwards; the [...] "Dagger of Throwing" [...] and the [...] "Battle Axe of Agor" [...] which are thrown at enemies and return like a boomerang; the [...] "Feather of Feather Fall" [...] which slows Kuros' falling speed; the [...] "Wand of Wonder" [...] and [...] "Staff of Power" [...] which shoot out balls of ice and fire, respectively; the [...] "Cloak of Darkness" [...] which makes Kuros invisible to enemies; the [...] "Boots of Lava Walk" [...] which allows Kuros to walk on the lava; [...] "Exploding Eggs" [...] which destroys all on-screen enemies; [...] "Alarm Clocks" [...] which stops all enemies for a brief period; knife and axe upgrades and an item simply called a [...] "horn" [...] (trumpet) which had many players confused as it appeared to be useless, its purpose was to reveal hidden doors to gem caves in some places. Other valuable treasures increase the player's score and include coins, orbs, chalices, and entire hoards of treasure. Rescuing the damsels in the levels also increase the player's score.|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners {{was pleased}} with the episode; he noted that he [...] "felt it was a very {{interesting}} character study". He later called it [...] "one of my favorite episodes". Frank Spotnitz considered [...] "Milagro" [...] to have been an [...] "underappreciated" [...] episode. For this reason, it was later included on the X-Files Essentials DVD compilation, along with seven other episodes. Scully's portrayal in the episode was given special attention. Stegall noted that [...] "if 'Milagro' has one message about perception, it is shown in Scully, who is seen through everyone's eyes (Mulder, Padgett, even Naciamento) but her own. Ultimately, we can't know which ones of these portraits of her character are 'right'. Maybe none of them are. It's a bravura performance from Gillian Anderson, well matched by Duchovny's low-key Mulder, acting on his instincts.". Handlen argued that the episode reduces Scully [...] "to a victim waiting to find out which handsome man will rescue her." [...] Elyce Rae Helford, in her book Fantasy Girls: Gender in the New Universe of Science Fiction and Fantasy Television, accused the show of [...] "reinforc the stereotype [...] of independent women as lonely, neurotic, and nostalgic for sexual attention from men." [...] Anderson herself felt that the character needed to [...] "loosen up". She was once approached by a fan who applauded Scully as the [...] "epitome of womanhood" [...] because she is a character who [...] "not only <b>can</b> <b>kick</b> ass but she [...] works with Mulder without jumping him." [...] Anderson, in return jokingly replied, [...] "So the epitome of womanhood is sexual restraint? [...] I don't think so." [...] The episode was particularly analyzed by fans of the show, and the fact that Scully was almost seduced provoked [...] "lively internet discussion".|$|E
