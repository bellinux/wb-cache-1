40|$|This report {{details the}} {{development}} and demonstration of a collision control technology for P&H-class mining shovels that minimizes the frequency and severity of dipper collisions between the bucket, <b>crawler</b> <b>tracks</b> and floor. The work was funded by ACARP as project C 15038. The collision control technology uses a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework whereby control actions for preventing collisions, are chosen based on the predicted future behaviour of the shovel. The system predicts future locations of the dipper over a receding time horizon using a set of mathematical models that are driven by the operator’s joystick commands. The prediction models incorporate the shovel’s electro-mechanical dynamics for hoist, crowd and swing motions. Predicted future bucket positions are tested for collisions using computational geometry algorithms on VRML models of the bucket, <b>crawler</b> <b>tracks</b> and floor. If a collision is predicted, the collision prevention algorithms calculate the minimum change to the operator’s command that will avoid the collision by a specified clearance distance. The altered joystick references are then passed to the P&H Centurion control system over the shovel’s PROFIBUS control bus. The technology has been successfully demonstrated on the CRCMining P&H 2100 BLE research shovel at Bracalba Quarry in Queensland and on a P&H 4100 A at Caballo Mine in Wyoming USA. The technology is currently being commercialized by P&H Mining Equipment...|$|R

40|$|Electric shovels {{are used}} in surface mining {{operations}} to achieve economic production capacities. The capital investments and operating {{costs associated with the}} shovels deployed in the Athabasca oil sands formation are high due to the abrasive conditions. The shovel crawler shoes interact with sharp and abrasive sand particles, and, thus, are subjected to high transient dynamic stresses. These high stresses cause wear and tear leading to crack initiation, propagation and premature fatigue failure. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a model to characterize the crawler stresses and deformation for the P&H 4100 C BOSS during propel and loading using rigid-flexible multi-body dynamic theory. A 3 -D virtual prototype model of the rigid-flexible <b>crawler</b> <b>track</b> assembly and its interactions with oil sand formation is simulated to capture the model dynamics within multibody dynamics software MSC ADAMS. The modal and stress shapes and modal loads due to machine weight for each flexible crawler shoes are generated from finite element analysis (FEA). The modal coordinates from the simulation are combined with mode and stress shapes using modal superposition method to calculate real-time stresses and deformation of flexible crawler shoes.

40|$|Longwall mining {{has gained}} the {{reputation}} {{as being the}} safest extraction method in underground coal mines. However, {{one of the most}} difficult tasks associated with longwall mining is moving the face once a panel is completed. Based on Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) fatality reports since 1996, longwall face recovery operations have claimed the lives of 5 U. S. miners and have resulted in numerous injuries. Recovery operations can be hazardous because they involve moving large pieces of equipment in very confined spaces. They are also conducted in highly stressed ground conditions due to front abutment loads generated by panel extraction. Shield removal is the most hazardous operation during face recovery because miners are constantly exposed to the unpredictable gob edge. To protect the miners, one or more walking shields, cribbing and/or other supplemental roof and standing supports are typically employed as breaker line supports as each shield is removed. At the Harris No. 1 Mine in southern WV, mobile roof supports (MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s) have been used in lieu of traditional walking shields on 17 face moves since 1997. MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s are shield-like support units mounted on <b>crawler</b> <b>tracks</b> and are commonly used during room-and-pillar retreat mining operations. For longwall recovery, the two biggest advantages that MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s have over traditional walking shields are that they are remotely controlled and are highly maneuverable. MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s have contributed to safer shield recovery and shorter move times at the Harris No. 1 Mine. This paper will address both the safety and the operational issues associated with MRS usage during shield recovery. It will also discuss new developments, including the use of the inherently safer battery powered MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s, which have been recently certified by the Mine Safety and Health Administration...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a historic {{overview of the}} role of mobile roof support (MRS) technologies in improving stability and worker safety and presents the results of recent field evaluations of the MRS load rate monitoring device and other remote deformation-monitoring techniques. Field studies were implemented at two sites in cooperation among researchers from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Maleki Technologies, Inc., and J. H. Fletcher & Co. The objective of the field programs were to (1) study the interaction between MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s and coal mine strata and (2) develop and test suitable monitoring systems for assessing roof and pillar stability. An MRS consists of a roof canopy, four hydraulic cylinders, a caving shield canopy, and associated electromechanical systems mounted on <b>crawler</b> <b>tracks.</b> The machines are controlled by radio from a remote location and operate on self-contained power units. Typically, MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s have capacities of 5, 340 and 7, 120 kN (600 and 800 tons). In comparison to posts, an MRS is capable of maintaining the yield load after significant amounts of roof-floor deformation. Because the mining cycle is accelerated, MRS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s help reduce the potential for time-dependent roof falls. MRS performance has been monitored in the laboratory under controlled static loading conditions and in the field under deep, two-seam mining conditions. Laboratory studies have quantified support capacity and system stiffness as a function of machine height. Field investigations have focused on determination of optimum operating conditions and development of warning systems that indicate excessive load on the machine and/or impending roof-pillar stability problems. Analyses of field data show that roof instabilities are influenced by (1) pillar failure, (2) pillar yielding, (3) mine seismicity, (4) geologic structures, and (5) panel layout designs and mining practice. Pillar yielding and failure (unloading) and seismicity can be conveniently monitored by the load rate monitoring device, but for consistent detection of roof falls, additional deformation measurements directly within the cuts are needed...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{practical}} method {{of reducing the}} resistant force acting on the <b>crawlers</b> of the <b>tracked</b> vehicle under steering motion is discussed. It {{is well known that}} the increase of the contact area, of the crawlers to soil can improve much tlre trafficability especially on soft loose ground, maintaining a better floatation of the vehicle in straight travelling [...] The enlargement of the contact area of the forcedly braked inner track in steering motion produces resistance against the powered outer track. Therefore the contact area of the inner track should be as small as possible, that is, just enough to support the half of the vehicle weight at one pivoting point in steering motion of the vehicle. The enlargement of the contact area sometimes leads to the increase of running resistance and wide contact area produces the resistant force against the powered outer track when the inner track is forcedly braked for steering. It can be therefore concluded from this fact that the contact area of the crawlers to soil should be desirably adjusted or controlled, depending on the vehicle's motion behavior for steering and straight travelling. The contact area of the crawlers should be more in straight travelling, and less in steering. There are two ways of changing the contact area : by shortening the width of grousers, or by varying the contact length of the crawlers. To change the contact length of the crawlers seems to be comparatively easier than to change the width of grousers. Some of the practical mechanisms of controlling the change of the contact area and reducing the resistant force occured in steering motion were proposed. In addition to this, the total distance required for the combine to complete the harvesting operation for any given area of the field was estimated. Based upon this analysis the percentage of the distance spent for straight travelling and for turning due to steering operation was also calculated. The durability of the combine crawlers was evaluated from the point of estimated total distance which the combine can travel before it can be scrapped. The possibility of applying this method of controlling the contact length of crawlers to the actual tracked vehicle is based on the considerations of (1) less distance required for steered turning compared to the distance required for straight travelling, and (2) excess cost of mounting such a control device. Further theoretical investigation will be reported in the following work...|$|R
