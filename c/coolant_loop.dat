The Ikata Nuclear Power Plant has two Mitsubishi 538 MWe Pressurized Water Reactor units with the Two Reactor <b>Coolant</b> <b>Loop</b> design (similar to the {{original}} Westinghouse design at Prairie Island, Kewaunee, and Point Beach plants) and one Mitsubishi Pressurized Water Reactor unit with the Three Reactor <b>Coolant</b> <b>Loop</b> design (similar to the Westinghouse Surry, North Anna, and Robinson plants). Units 1 and 2 started up on September 30, 1977 and March 19, 1981 respectively. Unit 3 is a three loop PWR rated at 846 MWe that started up on December 15, 1994.|$|E
5|$|A coolant {{control valve}} {{is mounted on}} the {{combustion}} chamber coolant bypass duct of each engine. The engine controller regulates the amount of gaseous hydrogen allowed to bypass the nozzle <b>coolant</b> <b>loop,</b> thus controlling its temperature. The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E
5|$|The target chamber is a two-wall {{structure}} {{filled with}} liquid lithium or a lithium alloy between the walls. The lithium captures neutrons from the reactions to breed tritium, and also {{acts as the}} primary <b>coolant</b> <b>loop.</b> The chamber is filled with xenon gas that would slow the ions from the reaction as well as protect the inner wall, or first wall, from the massive x-ray flux. Because the chamber is not highly pressurized, like a fission core, {{it does not have}} to be built as a single sphere. Instead, the LIFE chamber is built from eight identical sections that include built-in connections to the cooling loop. They are shipped to the plant and bolted together on two supports, and then surrounded by a tube-based space frame.|$|E
40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) employs an Internal Active Thermal Control System (IATCS) {{comprised}} of several single-phase water <b>coolant</b> <b>loops.</b> These <b>coolant</b> <b>loops</b> are {{distributed throughout the}} ISS pressurized elements. The primary element <b>coolant</b> <b>loops</b> (i. e. U. S. Laboratory module) contain a fluid accumulator to accomodate thermal expansion of the system.

During this time the element loops is a stand alone closed system. The solution approach for accomodating thermal expansion was affected by interactions of system components and their particular limitations. The mathematical solution approach was challenged by the presence of certain unknown or not readily obtainable physical and thermodynamic characteristics of some system components and processes.

25|$|Two {{things are}} {{characteristic}} for the {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) when compared with other reactor types: <b>coolant</b> <b>loop</b> separation from the steam system and pressure inside the primary <b>coolant</b> <b>loop.</b> In a PWR, there are two separate coolant loops (primary and secondary), which are both filled with demineralized/deionized water. A boiling water reactor, by contrast, has only one <b>coolant</b> <b>loop,</b> while more exotic designs such as breeder reactors use substances other than water for coolant and moderator (e.g. sodium in its liquid state as coolant or graphite as a moderator). The pressure in the primary <b>coolant</b> <b>loop</b> is typically , which is notably higher than in other nuclear reactors, and nearly twice that of a boiling water reactor (BWR). As an effect of this, only localized boiling occurs and steam will recondense promptly in the bulk fluid. By contrast, in a boiling water reactor the primary coolant is designed to boil.|$|E
25|$|The main change, and {{the most}} radical among the CANDU generations, {{is the use of}} {{pressurized}} light water as the coolant. This significantly reduces the cost of implementing the primary cooling loop, which no longer has to be filled with expensive heavy water. The ACR-1000 uses about 1/3rd the heavy water needed in earlier generation designs. It also eliminates tritium production in the <b>coolant</b> <b>loop,</b> the major source of tritium leaks in operational CANDU designs. The redesign also allows for a slightly negative void reactivity, a major design goal of all Gen III+ machines.|$|E

40|$|SCRAM Lite (SCRAM signifies Station Compact Radiator Analysis Model) is a {{computer}} program for analyzing convective and radiative heat-transfer and heat-rejection performance of <b>coolant</b> <b>loops</b> and radiators, respectively, in the active thermal-control systems of the International Space Station (ISS). SCRAM Lite is a derivative of prior versions of SCRAM but is more robust. SCRAM Lite computes thermal operating characteristics of active heat-transport and heat-rejection subsystems for the major ISS configurations from Flight 5 A through completion of assembly. The program performs integrated analysis of {{both internal and external}} <b>coolant</b> <b>loops</b> of the various ISS modules and of an external active thermal control system, which includes radiators and the <b>coolant</b> <b>loops</b> that transfer heat to the radiators. The SCRAM Lite run time is of the order of one minute per day of mission time. The overall objective of the SCRAM Lite simulation is to process input profiles of equipment-rack, crew-metabolic, and other heat loads to determine flow rates, coolant supply temperatures, and available radiator heat-rejection capabilities. Analyses are performed for timelines of activities, orbital parameters, and attitudes for mission times ranging from a few hours to several months...|$|R
25|$|The high {{temperature}} water coolant with boric acid dissolved in it is corrosive to carbon steel (but not stainless steel); this can cause radioactive corrosion products to circulate in the primary <b>coolant</b> <b>loop.</b> This not only limits the lifetime of the reactor, but the systems that filter out the corrosion products and adjust the boric acid concentration add significantly to the overall cost of the reactor and to radiation exposure. In one instance, this has resulted in severe corrosion to control rod drive mechanisms when the boric acid solution leaked through the seal between the mechanism itself and the primary system.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear fuel in {{the reactor}} {{pressure}} vessel {{is engaged in a}} fission chain reaction, which produces heat, heating the water in the primary <b>coolant</b> <b>loop</b> by thermal conduction through the fuel cladding. The hot primary coolant is pumped into a heat exchanger called the steam generator, where it flows through hundreds or thousands of small tubes. Heat is transferred through the walls of these tubes to the lower pressure secondary coolant located on the sheet side of the exchanger where the coolant evaporates to pressurized steam. The transfer of heat is accomplished without mixing the two fluids to prevent the secondary coolant from becoming radioactive. Some common steam generator arrangements are u-tubes or single pass heat exchangers.|$|E
25|$|If the PTCS cannot keep up {{with the}} heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) {{maintains}} the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water <b>coolant</b> <b>loop</b> used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid ammonia loop that can withstand the much lower temperature of space, and is circulated through radiators to remove the heat. The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including Kibō and Columbus, as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses. It can reject up to 70kW. This is much more than the 14kW of the Early External Active Thermal Control System (EEATCS) via the Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS), which was launched on STS-105 and installed onto the P6 Truss.|$|E
40|$|As {{air cooling}} of {{electronics}} reaches {{the limits of}} its applicability, {{the next generation of}} cooling technology is likely to involve heat pipes and single- or two-phase <b>coolant</b> <b>loops</b> (including perhaps loop thermosyphons, spray cooling, vapor compression refrigeration cycles, and loop heat pipes). These technologies are not suitable for analysis using 2 D/ 3 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, and yet the geometric complexities of the thermal/structural models make network-style schematic modeling methods cumbersome.

40|$|A {{number of}} major {{challenges}} were faced {{in the design and}} development of the Orbiter Active Thermal Control Subsystem (ATCS). At the system level, the initial challenges were to define an approach that would interface dual Freon <b>coolant</b> <b>loops</b> with multiple <b>coolant</b> <b>loops</b> from other vehicle subsystems with the lowest weight penalty to the Orbiter; and to provide highly responsive vehicle heat rejection throughout all of the Orbiter mission phases. Optimized heat exchangers, representing an advance in the state-of-the-art in heat exchanger design, were developed to transfer heat between the orbiter Freon <b>coolant</b> <b>loops</b> and five other vehicle systems. Flash evaporation was selected as a highly efficient and responsive means for cooling the Orbiter Freon loops during ascent and entry. The Flash Evaporator Subsystem (FES) utilizes cyclic water spray cooling in a chamber maintained at or below the water triple point pressure. A summary of the basic heat transfer research conducted to identify the fundamental heat transfer processes involved in water spray cooling in support of the FES design is given. The high fidelity dynamic analytical model of the FES that was generated to aid in the design of control logic, evaluate performance and simulate ground test and flight anomalies is discussed. A description of the FES and Integrated ATCS testing conducted in the SESL chamber A at NASA-JSC is also presented...|$|R
25|$|Pressurized water {{reactors}} (PWRs) {{constitute the}} large majority of the world's nuclear power plants (notable exceptions being the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States and Canada) and are one of three types of light water reactor (LWR), the other types being boiling water reactors (BWRs) and supercritical water reactors (SCWRs). In a PWR, the primary coolant (water) is pumped under high pressure to the reactor core where it is heated by the energy released by the fission of atoms. The heated water then flows to a steam generator where it transfers its thermal energy to a secondary system where steam is generated and flows to turbines which, in turn, spin an electric generator. In contrast to a boiling water reactor, pressure in the primary <b>coolant</b> <b>loop</b> prevents the water from boiling within the reactor. All LWRs use ordinary water as both coolant and neutron moderator.|$|E

40|$|Active cooling {{technologies}} such as heat pipes, loop heat pipes (LHPs), thermosyphons, loop thermosyphons (LTSs), and pumped single- or two-phase <b>coolant</b> <b>loops</b> require specialized modeling treatment. However, these 1 D ducted systems are largely overlooked in 3 D thermal mod-eling tools. The increasing popularity of CFD and FEM models and generation of analysis data from 3 D CAD data are strong trends in the thermal analysis community, but most software answering such demands has not provided linear modeling elements appropriate for the simulation of heat pipes and <b>coolant</b> <b>loops.</b> This paper describes techniques whereby CAD line-draw-ing methods {{can be used to}} quickly generate 1 D fluid mod-els of heat pipes and <b>coolant</b> <b>loops</b> within a 3 D thermal model.

Furthermore, the assumption of 1 D flow can be combined with 2 D/ 3 D models of walls, including advanced methods of extruding a complex 2 D cross-section along a curved or mitered centerline. To demonstrate these concepts, several distinct examples are developed and discussed...|$|R
