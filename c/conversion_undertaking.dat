The powerful architecture shows traces of many changes and <b>conversions</b> <b>undertaken</b> by a succession of owners.

5000|$|In India, Hindu {{organisations such as}} the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh {{assert that}} most <b>conversions</b> <b>undertaken</b> by zealous evangelicals occur due to compulsion, {{inducement}} or fraud. In the Indian state of Tripura, the government has alleged financial and weapons-smuggling connections between Baptist missionaries and rebel {{groups such as the}} National Liberation Front of Tripura. [...] The accused Tripura Baptist Christian Union is a member body of the Baptist World Alliance.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the first}} {{modified}} off-road vehicles was the Kégresse track, a <b>conversion</b> <b>undertaken</b> first by Adolphe Kégresse, who designed the original while working for Czar Nicholas II of Russia between 1906 and 1916. The system uses an unusual caterpillar track which has a flexible belt rather than interlocking metal segments. It can be fitted to a conventional car or truck {{to turn it into}} a half-track suitable for use over rough or soft ground.|$|R

5000|$|A {{number of}} owners {{replaced}} the troublesome engine with units from other cars, {{such as the}} Rover V8, or the Triumph 2.5-litre engine around which the Stag was originally designed. The number of such <b>conversions</b> <b>undertaken</b> is not known, but as at July 2017, 91% of Stags known to DVLA had a 3-litre engine, according to www.howmanyleft.com. It {{is not clear how}} many of these are original Stag engines and how many are Ford 3-litre Essex units. The once-popular Rover V8 conversion powers fewer than 4% of surviving Stags.|$|R

50|$|Scottish Protestant {{missions}} are organised programmes of outreach and <b>conversion</b> <b>undertaken</b> by Protestant denominations within Scotland, or by Scottish people. Long after {{the triumph of}} the Church of Scotland in the Lowlands, Highlanders and Islanders clung to a form of Christianity infused with animistic folk beliefs and practices. From 1708 the Scottish Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge (SSPCK) began working in the area. In 1797 James Haldane founded the non-denominational Society for the Propagation of the Gospel at Home. Dozens of lay preachers, divinity students and English preachers were sent to the region. In the early nineteenth century a variety of organisations were formed to support evangelism to the region.|$|R
50|$|A {{range of}} body types existed {{including}} those of a basic panel van, a minibus, and ambulance and horse-box. (A relatively popular horse-box <b>conversion</b> was <b>undertaken</b> by the Théault business at Avranches.) Customers for the little minibus version included various French police forces and the French post office which used the vans for transporting postmen.|$|R

40|$|The Vula'a {{people of}} {{south-eastern}} Papua New Guinea have been Christians {{for more than}} a century. Through a phenomenology of the transformation of their song and dance styles, this paper sheds light {{on the nature of the}} engagement between globalising religions and localised practice. It draws attention to the importance of the appropriation of the Polynesian prophet songs (peroveta), initially as part of the process of <b>conversion</b> <b>undertaken</b> by the London Missionary Society, and presently as an expression of local Christian identity that is shaped by ‘traditional’ exigencies. Song connects the living community and extends the bounds of that community to the non-living, promoting an existential plenitude. I argue that the Christian song styles which replaced traditional dances reproduce a distinctly Melanesian ontology. Further, the instrumental position of early Polynesian mission teachers, both as agents for the new religion and their self-representation as geographically distant ‘kin’ of the Vula'a problematises any easy division between the local and the global. 16 page(s...|$|R

50|$|The castle {{was used}} as a gaol from 1220, with {{additional}} buildings constructed {{on the top of the}} motte next to the keep. These buildings were demolished and rebuilt between 1789 and 1793 by Sir John Soane, and more alterations were made in 1820. The use of the castle as a gaol ended in 1887, when it was bought by the city of Norwich to be used as a museum. The <b>conversion</b> was <b>undertaken</b> by Edward Boardman, and the museum opened in 1895.|$|R
50|$|The Jewish {{people and}} the {{religion}} of Judaism are strongly interrelated. Converts to Judaism typically have a status within the Jewish ethnos equal to those born into it.

No extra tanks were fitted, the fuel load remaining at 80 tons (70 tonnes). The <b>conversions</b> were <b>undertaken</b> by FR Aviation Limited based at Hurn Airport, near Bournemouth. The in-flight refuelling probe was an original feature on the aircraft, {{but had been}} removed during the 1970s and 1980s {{due to lack of}} use; the probes were refitted prior to the conversion.

40|$|I {{am writing}} {{to you in a}} private {{capacity}} about the deficiencies of the UK historic sector national accounts (HSNA) and specifically in response to the letter that you have received from Mr Colin Mowl of the Office for National Statistics. Mr Mowl’s letter depicts the deficiencies of the HSNA as a minor matter of no significant public concern. This memorandum takes the polar opposite viewpoint. 1 As you know, but more general readers may not know, the UK sector accounts record the disposable incomes, current and capital expenditures, financial transactions and balance sheets of the institutional sectors identified in the national accounts: households, private and public corporations, government and the overseas sector (“Rest of the World”). The ONS releases the sector accounts quarterly in its publication UK Economic Accounts (UKEA) and annually in the Blue Book. ONS data for the main components of national income and expenditure begin in 1948 but the history covered by the sector accounts is incomplete, with a discontinuity in 1987. Before 1987, sector data are missing and frequently corrupted, problems that have arisen {{partly as a result of}} the <b>conversion</b> <b>undertaken</b> by the ONS in 1998 to the statutory European System of Accounts of 1995 (ESA 95). HSNA is my acronym for the ESA 95 sector accounts that potentially cover all years between, and including, 1948 2 and 1986. This memorandum is focussed on sectors’ incomes and expenditures, 3 a substantial sub-set of the UKEA. 4 On 23 February 2007, the Financial Times published an article in which I described the deficiencies of the HSNA. A copy of the FT article is attached for convenience. This exposé followed many months of private research, started with quite a different aim, which had unexpectedly 1 Without being implicated, Ken Coutts and Wynne Godley gave me sterling advice on earlier drafts...|$|R
