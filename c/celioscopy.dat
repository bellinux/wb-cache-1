40|$|Agenesis of the vermiform {{appendix}} is very rare. The incidence {{is estimated}} to be one in 100, 000 laparotomies for suspected appendicitis. Several criteria have to be met before the investigator can conclude that the appendix is congenitally absent. This case is reported to bring this entity to the attention of surgeons who may encounter a similar situation during <b>celioscopy.</b> A 29 -year-old patient was admitted through the emergency room with the chief complaint of abdominal pain. Acute appendicitis was suspected, and he was accordingly prepared for <b>celioscopy.</b> This report presents a patient with vermiform appendix agenesis diagnosed at <b>celioscopy</b> with concomitant mesenteric lymphadenitis. Agenesis of the vermiform appendix is very rare, and the diagnosis should not be made unless the ileocecal and retrocecal area are thoroughly explored...|$|E
40|$|Ovarian {{resection}} {{was performed}} by means of <b>celioscopy</b> in 12 patients with polycystic ovaries (PCO), who had not responded to clomiphene + HCG therapy. This therapy had induced ovulation in only 14 % of 56 therapeutic cycles. Ovarian resection through <b>celioscopy</b> induced ovulation in 45 % of cycles. Clomiphene + HCG therapy after resection in patients with no spontaneous ovulation induced ovulation in 44 % of cycles. Seven pregnancies followed in 5 women, equal to 41 % of patients. Hormonal patterns (FSH, LH, E 2, progesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, testosterone) before and after resection showed no significant variation. The authors emphasize other advantages of this technique, such as fewer surgical injuries than laparotomy, relative harmlessness of the treatment, the possibility of repeating it and of performing subsequent laparotomy...|$|E
40|$|Endosurgery {{has been}} used for {{assessment}} of fish celomatic cavity, as well as for obtaining biopsies for organic analysis. Such minimally invasive access may also be used for the analysis of environmental impact on biomarkers of pollution. In Brazil, studies and literature regarding the use of <b>celioscopy</b> in fish are sparse. The purpose of the current study was to develop a two-port <b>celioscopy</b> technique to obtain liver biopsy in silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen). Six adult female silver catfish were used. The animals were anesthetized and the inspection of the celomatic cavity were performed using a telescope and celioscopic-guided liver biopsy were taken using laparoscopic Kelly forceps. On the early postoperative period, the animals were released in a confined water reservoir where mortality could be checked. The liver samples were sent for histological assessment. There were no complications during surgery on early postoperative period. It was possible to visualize meticulously several organs (liver, spleen, stomach, pancreas, swim bladder, ovaries, bowel and transverse septum). In conclusion, the surgical technique and the anesthetic protocol proposed were suitable to perform liver biopsies in silver catfish and provided low morbidity...|$|E
40|$|The {{endoscopic}} and histopathological findings {{detected in}} Sparus aurata experimentally infected with third-stage Anisakis larvae without intermediate host are evaluated and discussed. In six fish, live nematode larvae were introduced by gastroscopy into the stomach. The first observation by endoscope, 15 days after challenge, showed {{the presence of}} some larvae {{at the level of}} gastric mucosa. An explorative <b>celioscopy,</b> performed 60 days after challenge, showed haemorrhages and/or nodules on the gut of two fishes. Necropsy and histology demonstrated parasites {{in the context of the}} tissue changes. The finding of live nematode larvae as well as the evidence of tissue change confirm the experimental susceptibility of gilthead sea bream towards Anisakis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A 31 -year-old {{woman from}} Cameroon was {{admitted}} to the University of Strasbourg Hospital in December 2007 with pelvic pain and fever that developed over three days. Her condition rapidly worsened and she underwent emergency exploratory <b>celioscopy.</b> Surgeons found peritoneal and retrouterine abscesses. The high rectum had a 4 -cm perforation with infiltrated, friable, and irregular edges. A biopsy specimen of this pseudotumoral specimen showed many Schistosoma haematobium eggs with an inflammatory reaction surrounding the eggs. The patient was treated with praziquantel (40 mg/kg/day) for 5 days and a 4 -week course of antibiotic therapy. Her progress was good and digestive continuity surgery was performed four months later. Schistosomiasis frequently involves rectal mucosa, but perforation is unusual. Our review of the literature found only two cases of colon perforation associated with S. mansoni infection. To our knowledge, this is the first case of rectal perforation caused by S. haematobium described in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{exciting}} advance in biliary tract surgery {{in the last decade}} has been the development of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Keyhole surgery, often labelled the "curse of surgery " is now the "challenge of surgery". The brief flirtation with non-operative management of gallstones is over except for a few very selected patients; only cholecystectomy cures the disease. Currently about fifty thousand cholecystectomies are carried out annually in the British Isles. Of course, laparoscopy is not a new technique. Professor Harold Rogers was a pioneer in this field in Belfast more than thirty years ago. ' Then peritoneoscopy, as it was called, was used in diagnosis and no procedure greater than guided liver biopsy or tumour biopsy was carried out. The gynaecologists widened the technique to include therapeutic procedures, most notably sterilisation. They favoured the term laparoscopy rather than peritoneoscopy. Lapara comes from the Greek language and means flank or loin and so laparoscopy or laparotomy are really incorrect terms. <b>Celioscopy,</b> which means to view the abdominal cavity, would be more the most correct terminology...|$|E
40|$|Cryptorchidism affects {{approximately}} 1 in 150 boys. Non-palpable testes represent nearly 20 % of all cases. If present, {{they are}} situated between the inferior renal pole and the external inguinal ring. Often at surgical exploration, however, a "nubbin" of testicular tissue is {{found at the}} end of blind ending spermatic vessels without demonstration of a recognizable testis; this finding is referred to as an absent testis. In other patients, no vascular or ductular (epididymis-vas deferens) or even testicular structure can be observed. This situation defines true testicular agenesis. Non-palpable testes have an increased risk of malignant transformation, infertility, associated inguinal hernia and congenital ductular abnormalities. Surgical treatment is often more complex and unsuccessful. Many imaging diagnostic methods to investigate patients with non-palpable testes (pneumoperitoneography, angiography, ultrasonography, CT scan and RMN) have been used so far but none of these has been uniformly accepted as the ideal investigative technique because they are unreliable and/or they involve a fair risk. Since Cortesi and associates first described in 1976 a case of abdominal testes identified by laparoscopy, this technique has gained increased acceptance by pediatric urologists and surgeons. Today, <b>celioscopy</b> plays {{a central role in the}} exploration of non-palpable cryptorchid testes. The authors try to establish an algorithm methodology for investigating non-palpable testes under the light of recently reported anatomical, pathological and surgical data. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The laparoscopic {{approach}} of pediatric surgery emergencies represents a specific preoccupation in hospitals {{everywhere in the}} world. Nowadays, when confronted with this pathology, pediatric surgeons are able to apply certain well-defined therapeutic protocols, depending on the technical equipment at their disposal and their laparoscopic expertise and training. We hereby present some of the surgical pediatric emergencies that {{have been subjected to}} minimally invasive celioscopic techniques, in the Department of Pediatric Surgery “Maria Sklodowska Curie ” Hospital, from August 1999 to July 2007. Out of 83 exploratory laparoscopies, 12 were performed for emergency pathology, other than acute appendicitis (in its various forms, including peritonitis) or acute cholecystitis. However, during the above-mentioned period, the number of therapeutic laparoscopies for emergencies has grown significantly (239 from a total of 663 laparoscopies), reflecting to a large extent the activity of a clinic with an emergency surgery profile. The authors conclude that exploratory laparoscopies in pediatric surgery emergencies are suited for surgical teams with a solid experience in <b>celioscopy</b> and a certain professional maturity, necessary to correctly appreciate the surgical and anesthetic risks involved by each individual case. It is not recommended that inexperienced laparoscopic surgeons embark on the “adventure ” of this minimally invasive approach for this type of pathology. Only when the training and learning process is fully and correctly completed, specialists ar...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} gastric secretion on the rate of recurrent ulcer after parietal cell vagotomy for duodenal ulcer. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Three hundred patients who underwent parietal cell vagotomy for duodenal ulcer between 1975 and 1986 were evaluated. The mean follow-up period for 280 patients was 5 years. METHODS: The gastric secretion tests concerned basal acid output (BAO) and peak acid output stimulated by pentagastrin or insulin. Tests were preoperative for 172 patients and postoperative for 118. RESULTS: At {{the end of that}} time, the overall incidence of symptomatic recurrent ulcer was 15 %. Two criteria were shown to be important predictors of recurrent ulcer: preoperative BAO > 7 mmol/hr, for which the recurrence rate 5 years after vagotomy was 30 % versus 11 % for values below this threshold (p = 0. 01), and postoperative BAO > 1. 4 mmol/hr, for which the recurrence rate at 5 years was 72 % versus 8 % for lower values (p = 0. 0001). All patients with recurrent ulcer had either a postoperative BAO > 7 mmol/hr and/or a postoperative reduction in BAO 7 mmol/hr and postoperative BAO > 1. 4 mmol/hr were shown to be factors predictive of RU. All patients with RU presented either with preoperative BAO > 7 mmol/hr and/or a reduction in BAO < 80 %. Consequently, in our opinion, these criteria could be used either to select patients for vagotomy or to assess the effectiveness of vagotomy of different types, especially those performed by <b>celioscopy...</b>|$|E
40|$|Our study aims to {{communicate}} the author’s experience concerning the pregnancy evolution at 316 women with various uterus malformations. At {{the beginning of this}} study, none of them was pregnant. The proportions of the various types of malformations encountered at the 316 cases were: septate uterus – 83 %, arcuate uterus – 3 %, bicornuate uterus – 3 %, pseudounicorn – 3 %, pseudodidelphys – 2 %, “H” shaped – 1 %, Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser – 4 %, uterine hypoplasia – 1 %. The diagnosis was established clinically and para-clinically (non-pregnant women). The paraclinical methods that were used were: ecography at all the patients, hysterosalpyngography at 80 % of the cases, hysteroscopy at 60 % of the cases, RMN at 10 % of the cases, <b>celioscopy</b> at 10 % of the cases, the exam of the sexual chromatin and caryotype at 5 % of the cases, hormonal dosage at 5 % of the cases. The conventional as well as endoscopical surgery was performed with a successful rate of 67 – 82 % pf the cases. The author concludes that uterine malformations precociously found benefit the best of surgical treatment, the difficult cases having the most reserved prognostic. The cause of reduced fertility in patients with endometriosis but patent fallopian tubes is not clear. In the mild stages of the disease a full course of hormonal suppression therapy should be the first therapeutic modality. In the advanced stages, a microsurgical approach, together with hormonal suppressive drugs, should be offered to the patients...|$|E
