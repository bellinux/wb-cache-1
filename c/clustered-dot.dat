40|$|Most {{printers}} {{based on}} electrophotographic technology use periodic, <b>clustered-dot</b> screening for rendering smooth stable prints. Despite great advancement {{in the print}} quality from periodic clustering, there exists one major drawback, namely periodic moiré, which is caused due to interference between multiple periodic screens superposed for color printing. Researchers have proposed solutions to this problem {{in the form of}} optimized screen periodicities, screen angles, and screen growth sequences. These solutions work well, but only when the involved color planes are few in number. A common scenario nowadays is the use of six or more primary colors. An alternative solution to avoid periodic interference between conventional <b>clustered-dot</b> screens is to use stochastic <b>clustered-dot</b> screens. A set of stochastic screens can be designed with optimum coarsenesses to be used exclusively or in conjunction with periodic screens to greatly reduce the chances of undesirable interference. ^ In this thesis, we propose a method of stochastic, <b>clustered-dot</b> halftoning and screen design based on Direct Binary Search (DBS). In earlier publications, DBS was shown to generate stochastic, dispersed-dot texture. An analysis of the relationship between halftone changes and the update of filtered-error in DBS lays ground for the development of CLU-DBS which originates as a <b>clustered-dot</b> halftoning variant of DBS. ^ The CLU-DBS procedure evolves from DBS by a simple modification of the filter sizes. CLU-DBS uses the optimization framework of DBS. Like DBS, it first initializes the filtered-error LUT on the basis of an initial random halftone. Subsequently, it iteratively selects pixels for toggle and swap with an objective to minimize the magnitude of the filtered error, and updates the filtered-error. The essential deviation from DBS is the use of different filters in the initialization and update steps. CLU-DBS uses an update filter of larger size than the initialization filter. ^ After proposing an intuitive explanation for the development of stochastic, <b>clustered-dot</b> texture from CLU-DBS optimization, we derive a closed-form expression for the underlying cost function that is being minimized in the course of optimization. Later this cost function is established as the guiding metric for stochastic, <b>clustered-dot</b> halftoning. In other words, CLU-DBS is implemented based on the cost metric. The dual-component cost metric reveals {{a great deal of information}} about the relationship between the input parameters and the output texture. We make use of this information to improve the quality of output texture. This is done by an intelligent selection of input filter sizes, the initial halftone, and the optimization procedure. ^ After developing a procedure for halftoning an image with CLU-DBS, we develop an algorithm for screen design. The screen design is complete after being post-processed for removal of certain defects from the tone reproduction curve. In order to evaluate the quality of halftones resulting from designed screen, we performed psychophysical experiments. The experiments involved comparison of CLU-DBS printed halftones with the halftones resulting from methods developed previously. The results of these experiments indicate subjects 2 ̆ 7 clear preference of the CLU-DBS halftones over other halftones in terms of smoothness of prints. ...|$|E

Not only does the K colorant consistently appear in the scanner channels as it absorbs uniformly across the spectrum, but cross-couplings between CMY separations are also observed in the scanner color channels due to unwanted absorptions.

The watermark patterns are embedded via phase modulation along the two periodicity directions of the halftone. Each embedded pattern can be visually detected, without interference from the other watermark, when the printed image, or a scan thereof, is overlaid with a decoder mask consisting of periodic lines oriented along the corresponding halftone periodicity direction. We experimentally demonstrate that our proposed multiplexing technique is effective.

40|$|Periodic, <b>clustered-dot</b> {{halftone}} patterns {{generated by}} screening with a threshold matrix are {{generally considered to}} be the preferred choice for printing with electrophotographic printers. This approach has the dual advantage of yielding more stable printed patterns than aperiodic, dispersed-dot halftoning methods, and being very computationally efficient, since the halftoning is performed on a pixel-by-pixel basis with simple comparison operations. However, there is a tradeoff with periodic, <b>clustered-dot</b> halftones between using a coarser screen to yield more stable halftone patterns and using a finer screen to yield better rendering of detail. ^ Conventional way is to single halftone pattern in a document, but in this paper, we consider a dual-mode halftoning process that switches between periodic, <b>clustered-dot</b> screens of two different frequencies—a low frequency screen for smooth regions and a high frequency screen for detail regions. These regions are described by an object map that is extracted from a high-level representation of the page content to be rendered. This high-level representation is contained in the page description language (PDL) version of the page to be printed. ^ This idea is beneficial in that we can reduce printing artifacts at smooth region and fine rendition at detail region. Nonetheless, one drawback of dual-mode halftoning approaches is appearance of boundary artifacts at the boundary between the smooth and detail halftones. When switching between periodic, <b>clustered-dot</b> halftones with two different frequencies, we may have an appearance similar to the 2 ̆ 2 jaggies 2 ̆ 2 that occur along an edge in a sampled image. ^ To overcome the boundary artifact, our screens obey a harmonic relationship. In addition we implement a blending process based on a transition region. We propose a nonlinear blending process in which at each pixel, we choose the maximum of the two weighted halftones where weights vary according to the position in the transition region. Moreover, we describe an on-line tone-mapping for the boundary blending process, based on an off-line calibration procedure that effectively assures the desired tone values within the transition region. We will provide detail algorithm and experimental results for the dual-mode object oriented halftoning. ...|$|E
40|$|Most halftoning {{algorithms}} assume {{there is}} no interaction between neighboring dots or if there is, it is additive. Without accounting for dot-gain effect, the printed image {{will not have the}} appearance predicted by the halftoning algorithm. Thus, there is need to embed a printer model in the halftoning algorithm which can predict such deviations and develop a halftone accordingly. ^ The direct binary search (DBS) algorithm employs a search heuristic to minimize the mean squared perceptually filtered error between the halftone and continuous-tone original images. We incorporate a measurement-based stochastic model for dot interactions of an electro-photographic printer within the iterative DBS binary halftoning algorithm. The stochastic model developed is based on microscopic absorptance and variance measurements. We present an efficient strategy to estimate the impact of 5 × 5 neighborhood pixels on the central pixel absorptance. By including the impact of 5 × 5 neighborhood pixels, the average relative error between the predicted tone and tone observed is reduced from around 23 % to 4 %. Also, the experimental results show that electro-photography-model based halftoning reduces the mottle and banding artifacts. ^ We also embed our printer model in stochastic <b>clustered-dot</b> halftoning algorithm CLU-DBS. The method CLU-DBS uses different filters in the initialization and update phases, in comparison to the same filters used in both the phases in the conventional DBS method. In this work, we derive a closed form expression for cost metric that is minimized in the CLU-DBS framework. This cost metric analysis not only provides us in-depth understanding of stochastic <b>clustered-dot</b> halftoning but also simplifies and speeds up the screen design algorithm and it also enables us to embed our printer model to generate visually pleasing stochastic <b>clustered-dot</b> textures. ...|$|E
40|$|Halftoning is {{a crucial}} part of image {{reproduction}} in print. First-order FM halftones, in which the single dots are stochastically distributed, is widely used in printing technologies, such as inkjet, that are able to stably print isolated dispersed dots. Printers, such as laser printers, that utilize electrophotographic technology are not able to stably print the isolated dots and therefore use <b>clustered-dot</b> halftones. Periodic <b>clustered-dot,</b> i. e. AM, halftones are commonly used in this type of printers but they suffer from undesired periodic interference pattern called moiré. An alternative solution is to use second-order FM halftones in which the clustered dots are stochastically distributed. The iterative halftoning techniques, that usually result in well-formed halftones, are operating on the whole input image and require extensive computations and thereby are very slow when the input image is large. In this paper, we introduce a method to generate image independent threshold matrices for first and second-order FM halftoning. The first-order threshold matrix generates well-formed halftone patterns and the second-order FM threshold matrix can be adjusted to produce clustered-dots of different size, shape and alignment.

40|$|For {{electrophotographic}} printers, periodic clustered screens are preferable due {{to their}} homogeneous halftone texture, robustness to dot gain, and increased dot stability. In traditional periodic <b>clustered-dot</b> color halftoning, to avoid the complete dot-on-dot printing, each color plane is independently rendered with a different screen at a different angle. However, depending on the screen angle and frequency, the final halftone may have strong visible moire due to {{the interaction of the}} periodic structure. Additionally, the slight displacement between each color plane may cause significant color shifts in the final halftone. This thesis addresses issues on finding optimal color screen sets which produce the minimal visible moire and are also robust to registration errors. To achieve these goals, this thesis proposes new techniques including common periodicity, halftone microtexture spectrum, and registration sensitivity analysis. The common periodicity of two different periodic screens characterizes the structural patterns of the mixed colors. In particular, large common periodic patterns are found to inherently produce dot-on-dot patterns with good robustness against registration errors. The halftone microtexture spectrum method is shown to predict the visible moire more accurately than the conventional moire-free conditions. In our registration sensitivity analysis, three propositions are established using the periodicity of periodic screens. From the established propositions, we derive the conditions for registration insensitivity. Our results demonstrate significant improvements of <b>clustered-dot</b> screens in terms of the resilience against registration errors and minimizing the visible moire over the conventional periodic screens. ...|$|E

40|$|In the {{printing}} industry, {{one of the}} most common methods for reproducing halftone images using bilevel printing devices is <b>clustered-dot</b> ordered dithering. The images produced using this method are quite faithful to the original and are visually pleasing. Nevertheless, only rational angles are attainable with <b>clustered-dot</b> dithering, due to the discrete nature of the grids. This phenomenon can become detrimental in the case of four-color printing, when different screen angles and maybe even different screen frequencies are used for separate color planes, thus producing a so-called Moiré phenomenon. Another important drawback, the so-called banding or contouring effect, is related to the limited area of basic screen elements used in traditional dithering. In order to deal with these problems, we have developed, within the scope of our research, several new techniques for digital halftoning: (1) pseudo-random halftone screening, (2) a new method for generating <b>clustered-dot</b> halftone images having a number of reproducible gray or colour levels which is independent of the screen element size (CombiScreen), (3) rotated <b>clustered-dot</b> dithering, based on discrete one-to-one rotation, and (4) rotated dispersed-dot dither. A new method of pseudo-random halftone screening is described. It starts by obtaining the quasi-random distribution of tile centers according to some well-defined spectral characteristics. We then obtain the desired tesselation of the output device space by applying the Voronoi polygonization process. Then, an analytic black-dot curve is calculated according to the resampled input signal level and the area of each given tile. This analytic curve is scan-converted to obtain the blackened pixels. In the second approach, we associate threshold values to all pixels inside every tile according to some specially tailored analytic spot function. Then, the standard threshold comparison process is applied. Unlike known error-diffusion techniques, the pseudo-random halftone screening technique can be applied to a high resolution printing process. The characteristic screen element size can be properly chosen so as to ensure the best trade-off between {{the printing}} process constraints and the most precise printing. The described halftone algorithm seems to be appropriate for high-resolution color and black&white devices (above 1000 dpi). A new method (CombiScreen) is proposed for generating <b>clustered-dot</b> halftone images on raster printing devices having a number of reproducible gray or colour levels which is independent of the screen element size. The dither tiles generated by this method may contain several screen elements having any rational orientation and size. Threshold values are distributed among the cells of the dither tile so as to produce a large range of gray values, while at the same time preserving the <b>clustered-dot</b> behavior of individual screen elements. When rendering images at smoothly increasing intensity levels, this new method generates few contouring effects and other visible artifacts. The method works equally well for quadratic, rectangular, parallelogram and hexagonally shaped screen elements. Resulting dither tiles are generally either of parallelogram or of hexagonal shape. Since CombiScreen enables the screen dot frequency or orientation to be chosen independently of the number of gray levels, it has proven to be specially effective when printing at resolutions between 150 to 600 dpi with ink jet printers and at resolutions between 300 and 1200 dpi with xerographic printers. A new operator of discrete one-to-one rotation is described. It offers means previously unknown in the art for generating rotated screens which approximate irrational angles with high-precision, producing much less disturbing interferences and artifacts than other methods. Therefore, a carefully prepared dither tile incorporating screen elements with the desired period, initial orientation, and dither threshold values defining their screen dot shape growth behavior can be rotated by discrete one-to-one rotation and keep the desired screen element period, the number of cells per screen element and the threshold values associated with each screen element cell, thereby preserving the screen dot shape growth behavior of the original dither tile. Several different discrete one-to-one rotation variants are described: a small angle rotation technique valid for a subset of rational rotation angles, a rigid band technique and a technique based on discrete shearing transformations. The high-quality of the so rotated dither tile is due to the fact that discrete one-to-one rotation preserves the exact number of elementary cells per screen element and their exact dither threshold values. The described method provides a new range of solutions for obtaining high-quality digital angled halftone screens. High-quality solutions can be found for generating three digital angled halftone screens, each 30 ° apart from each other, as known from traditional photographic colour screening techniques. Further solutions minimizing Moiré effects may be obtained by halftone screens whose first order frequency component vectors sum up to zero. This new method has turned out to be particularly effective when printing with color ink jet printers at resolutions between 150 and 800 dpi as well as with xerographic printers at resolutions between 300 and 1200 dpi. Rotated dispersed-dot dither is based on the discrete one-to-one rotation of a Bayer dispersed-dot dither array. The halftone patterns produced by the rotated dither method therefore incorporate fewer disturbing artifacts than the horizontal and vertical components present in most of Bayer's halftone patterns. In grayscale wedges produced by rotated dither, texture changes at consecutive gray levels are much smoother than in error diffusion or in Bayer's dispersed-dot dither methods, thereby avoiding contouring effects. Due to its semi-clustering behavior at mid-tones, rotated dispersed-dot dither exhibits an improved tone reproduction behavior on printers having a significant dot gain, while maintaining the high detail rendition capabilities of dispersed-dot halftoning algorithms. This technique has successfully been applied to in-phase color reproduction on ink-jet printers as well as to black and white reproduction on laser printers...|$|E

40|$|Periodic <b>clustered-dot</b> screens {{are widely}} used for {{electrophotographic}} printers due to their print stability. Typically there are four-colorant color printing: cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K). Moreover, with the occurence of high fidelity color printing, one or more additional primary colorants, such as orange and violet, are needed to extend the gamut of printer. Nevertheless, when applied to color printing, superpositions of periodic screens may cause objectionable moire patterns. It is much harder to be solved while more and more colorant planes are superposed. ^ Meanwhile, halftone designers also need to consider “print symmetry” (visual equality). In other words, in each colorant plane, we want the clustered dots as round as possible, in order to render more details equally in different directions, and for entire color screen set, we want the screen frequency of each colorant as close as possible. In this dissertation, we proposed a new color screen set which solves the moire problem and also gives the consideration to print symmetry issue. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{generalization}} of periodic <b>clustered-dot</b> halftones is proposed, wherein {{the phase of}} the halftone spots is modulated using a secondary signal. The process is accomplished by using an analytic halftone threshold function that allows halftones to be gen-erated with controlled phase variation in {{different regions of the}} printed page. The method {{can also be used to}} modulate the screen frequency, albeit with additional constraints. Visible artifacts are minimized/eliminated by ensuring the continuity of the modulation in phase. Limitations and capabilities of the method are analyzed through a quantitative model. The technique can be exploited for two applications that are presented in this paper: a) embedding wa-termarks in the halftone image by encoding information in phase or in frequency and b) modulating the screen frequency according to the frequency content of the continuous tone image in order to improve spatial and tonal rendering. Experimental performance is demonstrated for both applications. Index Terms—Clustered-dot halftones, continuous phase modu-lation, halftone watermarking, spatial/tonal rendering. I...|$|E
40|$|Halftoned separations of {{individual}} colorants, typically cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, are overlaid on a print substrate in typical color printing systems. Displacements between these separations, {{commonly referred to}} as “interseparation misregistration”, can cause objectionable color shifts in the prints. We study this misregistration-induced color shift for periodic <b>clustered-dot</b> halftones using a spatiospectral model for the printed output that combines the Neugebauer model with a periodic lattice representation for the individual halftones. Using Fourier analysis in the framework of this model, we obtain an analytic characterization for the conditions for misregistration invariance in terms of colorant spectra, periodicity of the individual separation halftones, dot shapes, and misregistration displacements. We further exploit the framework in a hybrid analytical-numerical simulation that allows us to obtain quantitative estimates of the color shifts due to misregistration, thereby providing a characterization for these shifts {{as a function of the}} optical dot gain, halftone periodicities, spot shapes, and interseparation misregistration amounts. We present simulation results that demonstrate the impact of each of these parameters on the color shift and demonstrate qualitative agreement between our approximation and experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Authentication {{watermarking}} is {{a hidden}} data inserted into an image, {{in order to}} detect any alterations. It seems to be almost impossible to design a really secure authentication watermarking without making use of the solid cryptography theory and techniques. In a cryptography-based authentication watermarking, a message authentication code (or digital signature) of the whole image is computed and the resulting code is inserted into the image itself. However, inserting the code alters the image and consequently its authentication code, invalidating the watermark. To avoid this problem, for gray-scale or color image, usually the least significant bits (LSBs) are cleared, the authentication code of the LSB-cleared image is computed and then the code is inserted into LSBs. Surely, one cannot perform the same procedure for binary images. This paper proposes a quite simple solution for inserting a secure authentication watermarking in dispersed-dot halftone images. This technique can also be applied {{to any kind of}} binary images (including <b>clustered-dot</b> halftones), though the visual quality is not as good as when applied to dispersed-dot halftones. The proposed technique can be used with both secret-key or public-key ciphers. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to reconstruct high quality gray-level images from bilevel halftone images. We develop optimal inverse halftoning methods for several commonly used halftone techniques, which include dispersed-dot ordered dither, <b>clustered-dot</b> ordered dither, and error diffusion. At first, the least-mean-square (LMS) adaptive filtering algorithm is applied in the training of inverse halftone filters. The resultant optimal mask shapes are significantly different for various halftone techniques, and these mask shapes are also {{quite different from the}} square shape that was frequently used in the literature. In the next step, we further reduce the computational complexity by using lookup tables designed by the minimum mean square error (MMSE) method. The optimal masks obtained from the LMS method are used as the default filter masks. Finally, we propose the hybrid LMS-MMSE inverse halftone algorithm. It normally uses the MMSE table lookup method for its fast speed. When an empty cell is referred, the LMS method is used to reconstruct the gray-level value. Consequently, the hybrid method has the advantages of both excellent reconstructed quality and fast speed. In the experiments, the error diffusion yields the best reconstruction quality among all three halftone techniques. Index Terms [...] -Error diffusion, inverse halftoning, LMS adaptive filter, MMSE table lookup, ordered dithering. I...|$|E
40|$|In Chapter 1, the {{electrophotographic}} (EP) {{process is}} widely used in imaging systems such as laser printers and office copiers. In the EP process, laser scanner jitter is a common artifact that mainly appears along the scan direction due to the condition of polygon facets. Prior studies have not focused on the periodic characteristic of laser scanner jitter {{in terms of the}} modeling and analysis. This chapter addresses the periodic characteristic of laser scanner jitter in the mathematical model. In the Fourier domain, we derive an analytic expression for laser scanner jitter in general, and extend the expression assuming a sinusoidal displacement. This leads to a simple closed-form expression in terms of Bessel functions of the first kind. We further examine the relationship between the continuous-space halftone image and the periodic laser scanner jitter. The simulation results show that our proposed mathematical model predicts the phenomenon of laser scanner jitter effectively, when compared to the characterization using a test pattern, which consists of a flat field with 25 % dot coverage However, there is some mismatches between the analytical spectrum and spectrum of the processed scanned test target. We improve experimental results by directly estimating the displacement instead of assuming a sinusoidal displacement. This gives a better prediction of the phenomenon of laser scanner jitter. ^ In Chapter 2, we describe a segmentation-based object map correction algorithm, which can be integrated in a new imaging pipeline for laser electrophotographic (EP) printers. This new imaging pipeline incorporates the idea of object-oriented halftoning, which applies different halftone screens to different regions of the page, to improve the overall print quality. In particular, smooth areas are halftoned with a low-frequency screen to provide more stable printing; whereas detail areas are halftoned with a high-frequency screen, since this will better reproduce the object detail. In this case, the object detail also serves to mask any print defects that arise from the use of a high frequency screen. These regions are defined by the initial object map, which is translated from the page description language (PDL). However, the information of object type obtained from the PDL may be incorrect. Some smooth areas may be labeled as raster causing them to be halftoned with a high frequency screen, rather than being labeled as vector, which would result in them being rendered with a low frequency screen. To correct the misclassification, we propose an object map correction algorithm that combines information from the incorrect object map with information obtained by segmentation of the continuous-tone RGB rasterized page image. Finally, the rendered image can be halftoned by the object-oriented halftoning approach, based on the corrected object map. Preliminary experimental results indicate the benefits of our algorithm combined with the new imaging pipeline, in terms of correction of misclassification errors. ^ In Chapter 3, we describe a study to understand image graininess. With the emergence of the high-end digital printing technologies, it is of interest to analyze the nature and causes of image graininess {{in order to understand the}} factors that prevent high-end digital presses from achieving the same print quality as commercial offset presses. We want to understand how image graininess relates to the halftoning technology and marking technology. This chapter provides three different approaches to understand image graininess. First, we perform a Fourier-based analysis of regular and irregular periodic, <b>clustered-dot</b> halftone textures. With high-end digital printing technology, irregular screens can be considered since they can achieve a better approximation to the screen sets used for commercial offset presses. This is due to the fact that the elements of the periodicity matrix of an irregular screen are rational numbers, rather than integers, which would be the case for a regular screen. From the analytical results, we show that irregular halftone textures generate new frequency components near the spectrum origin; and these frequency components are low enough to be visible to the human viewer. However, regular halftone textures do not have these frequency components. In addition, we provide a metric to measure the nonuniformity of a given halftone texture. The metric indicates that the nonuniformity of irregular halftone textures is higher than the nonuniformity of regular halftone textures. Furthermore, a method to visualize the nonuniformity of given halftone textures is described. The analysis shows that irregular halftone textures are grainier than regular halftone textures. Second, we analyze the regular and irregular periodic, <b>clustered-dot</b> halftone textures by calculating three spatial statistics. First, the disparity between lattice points generated by the periodicity matrix, and centroids of dot clusters are considered. Next, the area of dot clusters in regular and irregular halftone textures is considered. Third, the compactness of dot clusters in the regular and irregular halftone textures is calculated. The disparity of between centroids of irregular dot clusters and lattices points generated by the irregular screen is larger than the disparity of between centroids of regular dot clusters and lattices points generated by the regular screen. Irregular halftone textures have higher variance in the histogram of dot-cluster area. In addition, the compactness measurement shows that irregular dot clusters are less compact than regular dot clusters. But, a <b>clustered-dot</b> halftone algorithm wants to produce <b>clustered-dot</b> as compact as possible. Lastly, we exam the current marking technology by printing the same halftone pattern on different substrates, glossy and polyester media. The experimental results show that the current marking technology provides better print quality on glossy media than on polyester media. With above three different approaches, we conclude that the current halftoning technology introduces image graininess in the spatial domain because of the non-integer elements in the periodicity matrix of the irregular screen and the finite addressability of the marking engine. In addition, the geometric characteristics of irregular dot clusters is more irregular than the geometric characteristics of regular dot clusters. Finally, the marking technology provides inconsistency of print quality between substrates. ...|$|E
30|$|Knox and Wang [18] {{proposed}} a halftone-based watermarking method involving stochastic screening. For a single input contone image, two stochastic threshold matrices {{are used to}} ensure that the statistics of two output halftone images are correlated only in predetermined regions. When these two halftones are overlaid, dots in the uncorrelated regions are randomly located with respect to each other (i.e., most of the dots do not overlap), resulting in a darker gray level and therefore the appearance of a hidden watermark. Sharma and Wang [19] also {{proposed a}} halftone-based watermarking method involving screening, but unlike [18], the <b>clustered-dot</b> screen patterns are used. The hidden watermark is embedded by the varying phase of the dot-clusters between two halftone images. When overlaid, the hidden watermark appears in the regions that have phase disagreement. Fu and Au [20] proposed a data-hiding method in which ED is used for generating two halftone images: one halftone is generated using regular ED and the other is generated with stochastic ED. When the two halftones are overlaid, the regions characterized by the stochastic property darken, leading to the formation of a watermark pattern. For the abovementioned halftone-based watermarking method, the data are retrieved only if the multiple halftone images are obtained. Hence, the security level is high; however, the data capacity is commonly limited.|$|E
