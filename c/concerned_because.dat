25|$|Downey Jr. was on {{probation}} {{during the winter}} of 1999 when Hanson considered him for a role in Wonder Boys. Hanson was cautious because of the actor's drug history and <b>concerned</b> <b>because</b> it would be a tough film shot in sequence in Pittsburgh in the winter. Downey flew to Pittsburgh and had a long dinner conversation with Hanson where they addressed his problems. The actor demonstrated a commitment to the project and Hanson hired him. Reportedly, Downey acted in a professional manner for the entire four-and-a-half month shoot but after it ended, he returned to Los Angeles and violated his parole.|$|E

25|$|He was <b>concerned</b> <b>because</b> Mallory and Irvine {{seemed to}} be five hours behind their schedule. After this sighting, Odell {{continued}} on to Camp VI where he found the tent in chaotic disorder. At 2p.m. an intense snow squall began. Odell {{went out in the}} squall hoping to signal the two climbers who he believed would by now be descending. He whistled and shouted, hoping to lead them back to the tent, but gave up because of the intense cold. Odell holed up in C-VI until the squall ended at 4pm. He then scanned the mountain for Mallory and Irvine but saw no one.|$|E
25|$|Other {{problems}} involve states being {{reluctant to}} relinquish involvement in other regional groups, e.g., Tanzania's withdrawal from COMESA but staying within the SADC bloc for the Economic Partnership Agreement {{negotiations with the}} European Union. Many Tanzanians are also <b>concerned</b> <b>because</b> creating a common market means removing obstacles to the free movement of labour and capital. Free movement of labour {{may be perceived as}} highly desirable in Uganda and Kenya, and have important developmental benefits in Tanzania; however, in Tanzania there is widespread resistance to the idea of ceding land rights to foreigners, including citizens of Kenya and Uganda.|$|E
25|$|By {{the evening}} of the second day, every target {{specified}} on the master list in the Pennsylvania's combat center had been struck repeatedly. However, Oldendorf was <b>concerned</b> <b>because</b> no return fire had been detected from the concentrations of enemy heavy artillery shown in earlier aerial reconnaissance photos and because the latest photos contained no evidence that these weapons had been destroyed. It was surmised that the Japanese had moved their heavy artillery underground where they could have survived the bombardment. Despite these concerns, Oldendorf made the decision to call off the bombardment {{at the end of the}} second day of a pre-arranged schedule that called for a third full day of attacks.|$|E

25|$|No one {{doubted the}} skill of the Mujib Bahini or their {{commitment}} to Bangladesh. Trained by Sujan Singh Uban, an Indian Army insurgency expert, they operated {{under the direction of}} the R and outside the Bangladesh chain of command. Mujib Bahini members were better trained and armed than their Mukti Bahini counterparts. The Bangladeshi government and military leadership were <b>concerned</b> <b>because</b> most Mujib Bahini recruits were former Mukti Bahini members. Mujib Bahini activities often hindered Mukti Bahini operations, creating misunderstanding and distrust in the field. Clashes occurred between the groups, and the Indian Army and other organizations supporting the Bengali resistance were dissatisfied with Mujib Bahini activity outside the chain of command.|$|E
25|$|The title {{character}} of Babette was initially offered to Catherine Deneuve. Deneuve {{was interested in}} the part but was <b>concerned</b> <b>because</b> she had been criticized in her past attempts to depart from her usual sophisticated woman roles. While Deneuve deliberated for a day, Axel met with French actress Stéphane Audran. Axel remembered Audran from her roles in Claude Chabrol's films Violette Nozière (1978) and Poulet au vinaigre (1985). When Axel asked Chabrol (her former husband) about Audran's suitability, Chabol said Audran was the archetype of Babette. Axel gave the script to Audran, told her that Deneuve was contemplating the role, and asked her if {{she might be able to}} respond before the next day. Audran called two hours later and said she wanted the role. The following day, Deneuve declined and Audran was officially cast.|$|E
25|$|In late 1994, Microsoft {{was ready}} to release Windows 95, its next {{operating}} system. An {{important factor in the}} value consumers would place on it was the programs that would be able to run on it. Three Microsoft employees—Craig Eisler, Alex St. John, and Eric Engstrom—were <b>concerned</b> <b>because</b> programmers tended to see Microsoft's previous operating system, MS-DOS, as a better platform for game programming, meaning few games would be developed for Windows 95 and the operating system would not be as much of a success. This was compounded by negative reception surrounding the Windows port of the video game The Lion King. The game used WinG, which crashed on Compaq Presarios that came shipped with it following a partnership between Compaq and Disney, as the Cirrus Logic display drivers used by the Presarios were not thoroughly tested with the API.|$|E

25|$|The {{population}} of the town in 2001 was 85,029, by 2009 the estimated population was 86,900. Hastings suffers at a disadvantage insofar as growth is <b>concerned</b> <b>because</b> of its restricted situation, lying as it does with the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty to the north. Redevelopment of the area is partly hampered by the split administration of the combined Hastings and Bexhill economic region between Hastings and Rother district councils. There is little space for further large-scale housing and employment growth within the designated boundaries of Hastings, and development on the outskirts is resisted by Rother council whose administrative area surrounds Hastings. Rother has a policy of urban expansion in the area immediately north of Bexhill, but this requires infrastructure improvements by central Governments which have been under discussion for decades. This situation has now become the subject of parliamentary consideration.|$|E
25|$|While Newcastle upon Tyne {{had been}} an {{important}} local centre since Roman times, and was a major local market town from the Middle Ages, the development of Newcastle and Tyneside is owed to coal mining. Coal was first known to be dug in Tyneside from superficial seams in around 1200, {{but there is some}} evidence from Bede's writings that it may have been dug as early as 800 AD. Coal was dug from local drift mines and bell pits, and although initially only used locally, it was exported from the port of Newcastle from the mid 14th century onwards. Tyneside had a strategic advantage as far as the coal trade was <b>concerned,</b> <b>because</b> collier brigs could be loaded with coal on the Tyne and could sail down the east coast to London. In fact, the burgesses of Newcastle formed a cartel, and were known as the Hostmen. The Hostmen were able gain a monopoly over all of the coal exported from Tyneside, a monopoly which lasted a considerable time. A well-known group of workers on the river were the keelmen who handled the keels, boats that carried the coal from the riverbanks to the waiting colliers.|$|E

500|$|When {{he started}} working on his fourth studio album Confessions {{after the release of}} his 2001 album 8701, Usher chose not to branch out much with musical collaborators; instead, he chose to {{continue}} creating music with his previous producers. He again enlisted producer-songwriter Jermaine Dupri, who had produced songs for Usher's two previous albums. Dupri approached Bryan-Michael Cox, asking him to become a collaborator. Cox has been a frequent partner of Dupri who had produced hits for Usher as well. Like [...] "Burn", the second single from the album, Dupri and Cox conversed about a situation, creating the idea of the prospective song. However, they were <b>concerned</b> <b>because</b> they needed somebody to write such a song and they never thought Usher would do it. The concept became [...] "Confessions".|$|E

[...] Bell was a recurring guest on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, appearing in interviews as well as sketches. On The Late Late Show, she shows a humorous hostility towards Craig's robot skeleton sidekick Geoff Peterson, claiming that she had wanted to be Craig's sidekick on his show and taking it upon herself to cut Geoff down every chance she gets. Both Bell and Geoff Peterson appeared with Ferguson during the five Late Late Show' episodes filmed in France.|$|E
500|$|Pistons coach Larry Brown {{was not yet}} very <b>concerned,</b> <b>because</b> {{fights in}} the NBA rarely lasted {{for more than a}} few seconds. During the altercation, Artest lay down on the scorer's table to relax while putting on a headset to speak with Pacers radio {{broadcaster}} Mark Boyle. The microphone was not live. Boyle recalled that the broadcasting team knew Artest's personality and [...] "there was no way we were going to put an open mic in front of [...] in that situation". Pacers president Donnie Walsh later stated that Artest was following advice he had received on how to calm down and avoid trouble in a volatile situation. After unsuccessfully attempting to break up the confrontation, referees prepared to eject various players before the game resumed. Sportscaster Mike Breen, calling the game for ESPN, believed Wallace would be ejected, while Bill Walton was of the opinion that Stephen Jackson should be ejected as well, for shouting at the Pistons players and aggravating the situation. However, Breen expressed concern that, if ejected, Wallace would have to walk past the Pacers bench, which could trigger another incident.|$|E
50|$|A large {{concern in}} Japan is root rot {{experienced}} in conifer species {{as a result}} of Armillaria, a group of fungus species found in Asia.

500|$|... "Box Cutter", {{the fourth}} season premiere of Breaking Bad, was {{directed}} by Adam Bernstein and written by series creator Vince Gilligan. Filmed in January2011, the episode was edited by Skip MacDonald, {{one of a handful}} of editors who have regularly worked on the series. It was broadcast on July17,2011, and was the first original Breaking Bad episode in 13months, since the third season finale episode [...] "Full Measure" [...] aired in June 2010. AMC officials delayed the fourth-season premiere until July because they felt the Nielsen ratings would be better during the summer. While Breaking Bad scripts are generally 50pages long, the screenplay to [...] "Box Cutter" [...] was 43pages long, and Gilligan was originally <b>concerned</b> <b>because</b> he did not want to stretch out the episode simply to pad the running time. [...] "Full Measure" [...] ended with Jesse's pulling a gun on Gale and firing directly into the screen, with Gale's death not visibly revealed on-screen. This led to wide speculation among fans and reviewers that Jesse did not actually kill Gale, but rather aimed away from him and fired the gun. This speculation continued up until the original broadcast of [...] "Box Cutter", which confirmed Jesse indeed killed Gale. Gilligan said he never intended for that scene to be a cliffhanger and he thought it clearly conveyed that Gale had died.|$|E
500|$|The {{conflicts}} between Moreno and Saavedra generated international reactions.

Brazil was also <b>concerned</b> <b>because</b> many copies of the Gazeta were being distributed at Rio Grande do Sul, influencing their slaves with libertarian ideas. The Brazilian government sent Carlos José Guezzi to Buenos Aires, {{with the purpose of}} mediating in the conflict with the royalists at Montevideo and to ratify the aspirations of Carlota Joaquina to rule as regent. He met Saavedra in his first interview, in July, and got a positive impression of him. Saavedra said that if Carlota's rights were confirmed by the Spanish monarchy, Buenos Aires would support her, even if it meant they had to [...] stand against the other provinces. The following month he requested a representative for the Court of Brazil, offered Carlota's mediation with Montevideo, and pointed out that Brazil had forces near the frontier, awaiting orders to attack the revolution. This time, Moreno resisted. Moreno rejected sending a representative, and told him that the Junta did not work for the interests of Brazil, but for those of the United Provinces. He rejected the mediation as well, considering that no mediation was possible under a military threat. Guezzi was immediately sent back to Rio de Janeiro on the first available ship. He described Moreno as [...] "the Robespierre of the day", and accused the Junta of attempting to build a republic.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain was in {{his third}} season in the NBA, having set season scoring records {{in each of his}} first two seasons with 37.6 and then 38.4 points per game. [...] Frank McGuire, the Warriors' new coach, started the season vowing to get the ball to Chamberlain [...] "two-thirds of the time." [...] Sports Illustrated wrote that McGuire's [...] "eventual effect may be to measurably change the {{character}} of professional basketball from the brawling, hustling, cigar-in-the-face and eye-on-the-till game it has been for decades to the major league sport which it longs and deserves to be." [...] He was determined to play Chamberlain every minute of every game; the [...] and [...] center had missed only eight minutes and 33 seconds that season due to disqualification in a game from technical fouls. In three earlier games that week, Chamberlain had scored 67, 65, and 61 points respectively, giving him an already-record 15 times scoring 60 or more points in his career. He was closing in on 4,000 points for the season, needing 237 more; no other player had ever scored 3,000 points at that point. On December 8, 1961, in a triple overtime game versus the Los Angeles Lakers, he set a new NBA record by scoring 78 points, breaking the record of 71 previously set by Elgin Baylor. Legendary Laker broadcaster Chick Hearn often told the story that after the game, he asked Baylor if it bothered him that Chamberlain had an extra 15 minutes to break the record. According to Hearn, Baylor said he wasn't <b>concerned</b> <b>because</b> [...] "someday that guy is going to score 100". Rival center Bill Russell predicted, [...] " [...] has the size, strength, and stamina to score one hundred some night." [...] In a high school game in 1955, Chamberlain had scored 90points in a 123–21 victory. The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, [...] "Chamberlain might have hit 100 if he had played the entire 32 minutes." ...|$|E
