50|$|The 12M and 15M {{shared the}} same body, but the front grill and {{headlamp}} treatments differed as did the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> <b>clusters.</b> The <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> <b>clusters</b> on the 12M, reminiscent of those of the previous model, {{took the form of}} an extended lozenge. The <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> <b>clusters</b> on the 15M were rectangular.|$|R
50|$|Introduction of Commerciale, Break and seven-seat Family estate versions, with tandem {{coil spring}} rear {{suspension}} {{in the place}} of the sedan's single spring arrangement. These versions have a balanced spring system to assist in opening the tailgate, different <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> <b>clusters,</b> <b>rear</b> bumper arrangement and the fuel filler cap is no longer hidden behind the rear number plate, but behind a flap in the rear wing. These variants are also longer (4590 mm compared to 4445 mm) and heavier (1190 kg compared to 1100 kg) than their saloon equivalents.|$|R

5000|$|In Taiwan, the K11 March {{was sold}} from 1993 to 2007. It {{was sold in}} three {{generation}}s. The last generation was a facelifted and improved version called the Super March. It had a digital instrument <b>cluster,</b> LED <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> <b>clusters,</b> side mirror indicators, and an updated front end with crystal headlights. It also came with a semi leather interior with rear headrests. Another more upscale K11 variant, known as the Nissan Verita, was produced. This featured retro styling inside and out. Notable differences included rounded headlights and taillights, a distinctive front end, along with a chrome and faux wood trimmed interior. All Taiwan K11s came with the CG13DE engine. There was also a three-box sedan called the [...] "March Cubic" [...] designed exclusively for the Taiwanese market by Nissan Yulon; its taillights, trunklid, and rear bumpers were different from those used in Japanese market versions.|$|R

50|$|On early built vehicles, the {{high-mounted}} {{rear window}} curved {{up into the}} roof, with a horizontally grooved panel below it. Horizontal <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> <b>clusters</b> were fitted low down. The rear end underwent a major redesign in 1993 following complaints about leaks. The revised design had a flat rear window, separated from the roofline, and vertical <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> <b>clusters</b> mounted at the body corners.|$|R

50|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> units {{each had}} an all-red cover and {{contained}} only two bulbs. One of the bulbs operated as a conventional brake <b>light.</b> The other <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> bulb contained two filaments, {{one of which}} came one with the light switch and the second of which flashed when the turn indicator switch was used, so following traffic saw just a single light becoming successively and rhythmically brighter and less bright when the car was about to turn. The effect will have been unremarkable to North American drivers, but triggered comment in Europe. Here, even where single piece <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> units are fitted, <b>rear</b> indicator <b>lights</b> were and are normally included in their own separate {{part of the overall}} <b>light</b> <b>cluster</b> units.|$|R

Present results indicated that in the working tasks, the P 40 dark reared rats outperformed their <b>light</b> <b>reared</b> counterparts. No difference in performance was observed between the P 40 <b>light</b> and dark <b>reared</b> rats. In both the <b>light</b> and dark <b>reared</b> groups, the P 60 animals outperformed the P 40 ones on the working memory experiments. In contrast, the P 40 <b>light</b> and dark <b>reared</b> groups showed superiority to the P 60 animals in the reference memory tasks.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} the total photospheric light in nearby galaxy clusters is thought to be contained within the diffuse intracluster light (ICL), which extends 100 s of kpc from cluster cores. The study of the ICL can reveal details of the evo-lutionary histories and processes occurring within galaxy clusters, however since it has a very low surface brightness {{it is often difficult to}} detect. We present here the first measurements of the ICL as a fraction of total <b>cluster</b> <b>light</b> at z ∼ 1 using deep J-band (1. 2 µm) imaging from HAWK-I on the VLT. We investigate the ICL in 6 X-ray selected galaxy clusters at 0. 86 z 61. 2 and find that the ICL below isophotes µJ = 22 mag/arcsec 2 constitutes 1 – 4 % of the total <b>cluster</b> <b>light</b> within a radius R 500. This is broadly consistent with simulations of the ICL at a similar redshift and when compared to nearby observations suggests that the {{fraction of the}} total <b>cluster</b> <b>light</b> that is in the ICL has increased by a factor 2 – 4 since z∼ 1. We also find the {{fraction of the total}} <b>cluster</b> <b>light</b> contained within the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) to b...|$|R
40|$|In this report, the {{magnitude}} of the problem of rear-end collisions is described. The report also draws up a test framework based on a theoretical approach and a judgement of various recent provisions for improving the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> configuration. These provisions include: regulation of <b>light</b> intensity; <b>rear</b> fog lights; braking-dependant lights; early-warning brake lights; lights activated by emergency stopping; and solutions reducing the wearing out of lamps. The test framework makes it possible to judge inventions on their necessity, functioning, and optical features. Adjustments to the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> configuration during the last decennia involved addition of a component (third brake <b>light,</b> <b>rear</b> fog <b>light).</b> In this, existing functions were improved so that a gradual introduction could be applied (only new cars). As an adjustment often has consequences for the whole <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> configuration, it is concluded that `Europe' was justly reserved. Once good arguments for introducing a new function or component (necessitating) are presented, the complete renewal of the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> configuration can be considered. Matters such as integration, standardisation, and adaptive regulation then become relevant. Recommendations are made for further adjustments to the <b>rear</b> <b>light</b> configuration. These adjustments are also aimed at improving the present functions, so that retrofit is unnecessary. These are: making two <b>rear</b> fog <b>lights</b> mandatory; voluntary regulation of light intensity; voluntary alarm lights for emergency stops; and voluntary alarm lights after an emergency stop...|$|R

40|$|The pasta phases are {{calculated}} for warm stellar matter in {{a framework of}} relativistic mean-field models, including the possibility of <b>light</b> <b>cluster</b> formation. Results from three different semiclassical approaches are compared with a quantum statistical calculation. <b>Light</b> <b>clusters</b> are considered as point-like particles, and their abundances are determined from the minimization of the free energy. The couplings of the light-clusters to mesons are determined from experimental chemical equilibrium constants and many-body quantum statistical calculations. The effect of these <b>light</b> <b>clusters</b> on the chemical potentials is also discussed. It is shown that including heavy <b>clusters,</b> <b>light</b> <b>clusters</b> are present until larger nucleonic densities, although with smaller mass fractions.
