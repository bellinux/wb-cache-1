40|$|Introduction: Iron {{deficiency}} anaemia (IDA) is {{a significant}} public health problem in Northern Ghana especially amongst women and children. Leafy green vegetables are major contributors to iron intake {{in this part of}} the world; poor iron bioavailability from these food sources may be part of the reason for the high prevalence of IDA. Evidence suggests that sweet potato and Moringa leaves might be better sources of bioavailable iron, compared with other leafy green vegetables, as both have high levels of iron, and also beta−carotene − a dietary factor that has been suggested to improve iron bioavailability. Aims/Hypothesis: Our research aims were to evaluate iron bioavailability of sweet potato and Moringa leaves in comparison with other leafy green vegetables commonly consumed in Ghana. We hypothesized that iron uptake from sweet potato and Moringa leaves would be higher compared with the other tested vegetables. Methods: We used the Caco− 2 cell/in vitro digestion system; Caco− 2 cell ferritin formation was used as a surrogate marker of iron bioavailability. In addition, we also measured levels of other nutrients and dietary factors known to affect iron bioavailability: beta−carotene, iron, <b>calcium,</b> zinc, <b>ascorbate,</b> phytates and polyphenols. Results: Iron bioavailability from all tested vegetables was poor despite relatively high absolute levels of iron in the leaf samples (14. 5 − 24. 6 mg/ 100 grams dry weight); there was no statistically significant difference in iron uptake between any of the tested varieties or the control sample with no added iron. Levels of phytates and polyphenols, known inhibitors of iron uptake, were high and probably accounted for the low iron bioavailability of tested leaves. As expected, beta−carotene levels were highest in the sweet potato and Moringa leaves (ranging from 47 − 98 micrograms retinol activity equivalent) /gram freeze dried leaf) − approximately 100...|$|R
40|$|Pharmacologic ascorbate’s {{use as an}} {{adjuvant}} chemotherapeutic {{in advanced}} cancer has a controversial history. In the past decade, interest in this treatment was renewed based on a re-assessment of the pharmacokinetics of ascorbate, {{which led to the}} discovery that ascorbate’s selective cytotoxicity only occurs at plasma levels achievable through intravenous administration, but not through oral administration. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 2 nd leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. It is often diagnosed at a late stage when few treatment options remain. The current standard of care for unresectable HCC is sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor targeting Raf- 1 and VEGFR- 2 and - 3, as well as other kinases. New combination therapies are urgently needed. ^ Here we investigated the mechanism of selective ascorbate-induced cytotoxicity in tumor cells, including Hep G 2 cells, compared to primary hepatocytes. Additionally, we examined the combination of ascorbate and sorafenib in Hep G 2 cells and performed a preliminary assessment of this combination in Huh- 7 and SNU- 449 cells. H 2 O 2 formation was required for ascorbate cytotoxicity, as extracellular catalase treatment protected tumor cells. H 2 O 2 generated by glucose oxidase treatment also caused cell killing, but treatment with a pharmacological dose (5 - 20 mM) of ascorbate was significantly more cytotoxic at comparable rates of H 2 O 2 production, suggesting that ascorbate enhanced H 2 O 2 cytotoxicity. Ascorbate treatment of Hep G 2 cells caused deregulation of cellular calcium homeostasis, resulting in massive mitochondrial <b>calcium</b> accumulation. <b>Ascorbate</b> acted synergistically with the chemotherapeutic sorafenib in killing Hep G 2 cells, but not primary hepatocytes, suggesting adjuvant ascorbate treatment can broaden sorafenib’s therapeutic range. ^ Sorafenib caused mitochondrial depolarization and prevented mitochondrial calcium sequestration. This observation prompted us to performed preliminary experiments using extracellular flux analysis (Seahorse Bioscience) to investigate sorafenib’s effects on the mitochondrial electron transport chain and mitochondrial energy conservation. Here we provide evidence that sorafenib may be a reversible general inhibitor of the ETC. Preliminary results of the combination of ascorbate and sorafenib in Huh- 7 and SNU- 449 cells varied in effectiveness compared to the synergistic response seen in Hep G 2 cells, suggesting the net effects of sorafenib result from multiple actions of the drug on different cellular functions, the outcome of which may vary depending on the specific properties of these cells. ^ Additionally, we present the case of a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who had prolonged regression of a rib metastasis upon combination treatment with ascorbate and sorafenib, indicating that these studies have direct clinical relevance. ...|$|R

40|$|Ascorbic {{acid and}} <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> are used commercially in dip {{solutions}} to inhibit {{the development of}} browning {{on the surface of}} fresh-cut apple slices. A sodium chloride dip has also been shown to inhibit browning and this study examined its interaction with various forms of ascorbate on the postharvest life of apple slices. Comparison of the effectiveness of ascorbate moieties showed that the concentration of ascorbic acid required to achieve any desired postharvest life was twice that of <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate,</b> but calcium, sodium and potassium ascorbates were equally effective in inhibiting browning. The inclusion of 0. 1 mol/l sodium chloride into a dip requires only half the concentration of ascorbate to maintain the same postharvest life. The very low cost of sodium chloride means that materials in such a dip are about half the cost of an ascorbate-only solution.

40|$|Osteoporosis is {{a disease}} {{resulting}} from bone loss and from the structural deterioration of bone tissue. Yet osteoporosis is both controllable and preventable. In terms of prevention, {{a good source of}} calcium supplementation is important in promoting strong, healthy bones. The bioavailability of <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> and calcium acetate was studied in an animal model using a radioactive tracer technique. At two dosage levels, calcium from <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> was absorbed higher than from calcium acetate, indicating <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> is a better bioavailable calcium supplement. Alpha-lactalbumin, a whey protein fraction, further enhanced calcium absorption from both salts in an animal model. Therefore, <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> in combination with alpha-lactalbumin was a superior bioavailable calcium source. ^ Several animal and short-term human studies indicate that isoflavones may be used as an alternative therapy to estrogen replacement therapy. However, the results were contradictory. The inadequacy of information and controversy on skeletal effects of isoflavones led us to design the present study to test the effectiveness of soy isoflavones on treating osteoporosis in comparison to the estrogen replacement therapy in an adult animal model for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Unmated 6 mo. old ovariectomized and sham operated female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 9 groups (16 rats/group). Calcium metabolic balance, bone densitometry, bone histomorphometry and bone mechanical testing were used to investigate calcium and bone metabolism. After ovariectomy, estrogen prevented bone loss in trabecular bone and suppressed formation on both trabecular and cortical bone surfaces. Isoflavones given as soy protein or supplements did not prevent trabecular bone loss. Combining isoflavones with estrogen had no additional benefits. None of the treatments affected calcium absorption or calcium balance significantly. Therefore, we conclude that soy isoflavones did not alter calcium metabolism or bone metabolism at the doses tested. ...|$|E

40|$|Calcium is {{the major}} cation of bone mineral, the process of {{skeletal}} development and remodeling is inherently related to calcium metabolism. Kinetic modeling enables the rapid assessment of changes that occur associated with age, therapeutic intervention. Therefore, calcium metabolism was investigated using kinetic analysis in rats via several independent studies. ^ First, calcium absorption from two different calcium salts, <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> and calcium acetate, was compared. As measured by femur uptake, fractional calcium absorption from <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> was substantially higher than that from calcium acetate (70 % ± 5 vs. 45 % ± 5) on a 25 mg test load. To further confirm this observation, a metabolic study was conducted. Four groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10 /group) received oral or intravenous doses of 25 mg Ca as <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> or calcium acetate. Each dose contained 25 μCi 45 Ci. Sequential blood, urine and fecal samples were collected over 48 hours. Data was analyzed by compartmental modeling. Results of kinetic analysis demonstrated that the higher absorption of <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> was due to a longer residence time in the gut. ^ Secondly, the effect of Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) on calcium metabolism in growing rats was examined using the same kinetic model. IGF-I is an important mediator during pubertal skeletal growth, and has been considered as a potential treatment for osteoporosis. Measurement of bone quality and calcium metabolism were first determined in rats from age 6 weeks to 31 weeks {{in order to determine}} the timing for IGF-I intervention. Human recombinant IGF-I/IGFBP- 3 complex was chronically infused into female rats at two different ages: 6 and 9 weeks of age, representing early puberty and young adulthood in humans.

Femoral calcium content was also significantly higher in IGF-I treated pubertal rats, 493 ± 42, compared to control rats, 368 ± 24 mg calcium/g ash weight. Kinetic analysis revealed the treatment resulted in higher intestinal calcium absorption and faster calcium clearance from the circulation in pubertal rats. However, the IGF-I treatment failed to alter calcium metabolism in young adult rats. ...|$|E

Vitamin C, {{in the form of}} ascorbic acid and its calcium and sodium salts, ascorbyl palmitate, sodium calcium ascorbyl phosphate and sodium ascorbyl phosphate, is safe for all animal species. Setting a maximum content in feed and water for drinking is not considered necessary. Data on the vitamin C consumption of consumers are based on the levels of vitamin C in foodstuffs, including food of animal origin, produced in accordance with current EU legislation on the supplementation of feed with vitamin C. The exposure is far below the guidance level. Any potential contribution of the use of vitamin C in feed is therefore already considered in the above data. Consequently, the use of vitamin C in animal nutrition is not of concern for consumer safety. In the absence of inhalation toxicity studies it would be prudent to assume that inhalation of dust from the additives presents a health hazard to workers. Sodium calcium ascorbyl phosphate is not an irritant to skin and eyes and is unlikely to be a skin sensitiser. This conclusion is extrapolated to sodium ascorbyl phosphate.

RESULTS: PCAAS for 1 or 2 weeks prior to slicing had an overall {{positive effect on the}} resultant quality of fresh-cut apple slices. The most significant responses to PCAAS were the suppression of both phenolic and o-quinone accumulation in slices, and this was related to the significantly lower browning potential values obtained for slices from PCAAS-treated apples.

Compared to ascorbic acid (AA), {{the most common form of}} vitamin C, EC can be consumed by a wider range of individuals due to its neutralized pH which allows for supplementation at high doses with greater tolerability for people who are sensitive to acidic foods (Gruenwald et al. 2006; Ye et al. 2015). Evidence suggests that EC may also have a higher bioavailability. Studies show that pre-incubation of cells with threonate results in a stimulated uptake of vitamin C in a dose-dependent manner (Fay et al. 1994; Fay and Verlangieri 1991). In rodents, higher plasma concentrations and less rapid excretion (Bush and Verlangieri 1987) as well as more available vitamin C activities (Verlangieri et al. 1991) have been observed in comparison with AA.

These results are compatible with the belief that supplementary vitamin C can reduce the burden of winter illness, but the intake need not be as high as has sometimes been claimed...|$|E
40|$|Objective To assess in a periodontally diseased rural {{population}} deprived from regular dental care and having poor dietary conditions, {{the effect of}} vitamin C/calcium threonate/citrus flavonoids (VitC/Ca/Fl) supplementation on subgingival microbiota and plasma levels of vitamin C, HbA 1 c and hsCRP. Material & Methods The study population consisted of 98 subjects who previously participated in a prospective study on {{the natural history of}} periodontitis. Participants were instructed to consume one tablet/day containing 200 mg Ester C® <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate,</b> 25 mg calcium threonate and 100 mg citrus flavonoids for 90 days. Following parameters were evaluated: prevalence/amount of seven traditional periodontal pathogens, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV); and plasma levels of vitamin C, HbA 1 c and hsCRP. Results After VitC/Ca/Fl supplementation, 100 % of subjects showed normal plasma vitamin C values compared to 55 % before. At baseline, 48 % of subjects harboured Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, > 97 % the other periodontal pathogens and 73 % EBV. Supplementation with VitC/Ca/F reduced the subgingival load of all studied bacteria (p-values: 0. 014 - 0. 0001) and EBV (p < 0. 0001) substantially in all initially positive subjects. Plasma levels of HbA 1 c and hsCRP dropped in all subjects (p < 0. 0001). Conclusion This uncontrolled study suggested that supplemental VitC/Ca/Fl may be helpful in reducing subgingival numbers of periodontal pathogens and EBV, and promoting systemic health...|$|E
40|$|NIVA has {{examined}} {{the effect of a}} water quality improvement agent consisting of treated corraline algae - and shell sand, chitosan and <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> paced in a "tea bag. " One bag should be sufficient to treat 2 litres of water. The bag is submerged in the water during stirring, and shall remain in the water for approx. 10 min. before it is removed and the water is ready for consumption. The effect of the product was examined in 4 diffferent untreated water qualities. The results show that the effect was dependent on the initial water quality. More alkalinity, minerals and essential elements such as K, Na, Ca, Mg and C 1 were added to acidic water with low mineral content than to water with a higher pH and mineral content. The treatment with the water quality improvement agent generally resulted in a small increase in turbidity, colour and organic matter. However, this is not belived to have any practical consequences, With regard to examined metals and trace elements, there were small or no differences between treated and untreated water. One exception was mercury, which was reduced. The water quality improvement agent proved to be efficient in the removal of free and combined chlorine from chlorinated drinking water. The results also indicate that the agent reduces the number of culturable E. coli in water...|$|E
40|$|Lenticel {{discolouration}} (LD) is {{a common}} disorder of mango fruit around the world. It results in poor appearance and disappointment of consumers. LD is exacerbated by treatment of mango fruit with gamma irradiation for insect disinfestation. The issue is problematic on the relatively new mango cultivar 'B 74 ' and may represent an oxidative browning process. With a view to reducing irradiationinduced LD on 'B 74 ', postharvest wax (one and three layers; 75 % carnauba wax) and antioxidant (100 mM ascorbic acid, 100 mM calcium chloride, 10, 50 and 100 mM <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate)</b> dip treatments were investigated. Treatment of green mature fruit with three layers of wax prior to exposure to 557 Gy gamma irradiation reduced LD by 40 % relative to the non-waxed control. However, the fruit failed to ripen properly as evidenced by delayed skin colour change, retarded softening and increased skin browning {{as compared to the}} controls and fruit coated with one layer of wax. Treatment with one layer of wax did not reduce LD. Mechanistically, the responses suggest that air exchange plays a pivotal role in LD. A lowered oxygen concentration in the lenticels may reduce the disorder after irradiation treatment. Postharvest treatments with the various antioxidants failed to reduce LD. Rather, all antioxidant treatments at the test concentrations, except calcium chloride, significantly increased skin browning...|$|E

40|$|Microbial {{activity}} and browning were minimized and fresh-cut rose apple quality was maintained using sodium chlorite (SC) combined with calcium chloride (CC) and <b>calcium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> (CaAs) and by investigating the optimal concentration and dipping time of SC for inhibiting microbial {{activity and}} browning. Fresh-cut rose apple samples were dipped in SC solution at 100  mg/L and 200  mg/L for 1  min and 3  min, with filtered water and non-dipped samples as controls. All samples were kept at 4  ±  2  °C for 9  d. The {{results showed that}} 200  mg/L SC for 3  min was the best treatment to inhibit microbial growth (total bacteria, yeast and molds, Escherichia coli and coliforms), delay browning and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity of fresh-cut rose apples, but could not maintain the fresh firmness. A firmness experiment was conducted by dipping fresh-cut rose apples in 200  mg/L SC and in 200  mg/L SC combined with 20  g/L CC and 20  g/L CaAs (SC + CC + CaAs) for 3  min before storage at 4  ±  2  °C for 9  d. Samples immersed in filtered water were used as the control. The combined treatment delayed microbial contamination and browning by reducing the PPO activity and the accumulation of phenolic content, and maintained the fresh firmness of fresh-cut rose apples. Thus, the combination treatment of SC + CC + CaAs solution can protect fresh-cut rose apples against microbial contamination and delay browning and maintain firmness...|$|E
