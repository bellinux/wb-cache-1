50|$|In 1718 Nartov invented {{what might}} have been the first lathe with a {{mechanical}} cutting tool-supporting carriage and a set of gears (also known as a <b>compound</b> <b>rest</b> or <b>slide</b> <b>rest).</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> (as the {{earliest}} forms of carriage were known) {{can be traced}} to the fifteenth century. In 1718 the tool-supporting <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> with a set of gears was introduced by a Russian inventor Andrey Nartov and had limited usage in the Russian industry. In the eighteenth century the <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> was also used on French ornamental turning lathes. The suite of gun boring mills at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, in the 1780s by the Verbruggan family also had <b>slide</b> <b>rests.</b> The story has long circulated that Henry Maudslay invented it, but he did not (and never claimed so). The legend that Maudslay invented the <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> originated with James Nasmyth, who wrote ambiguously about it in his Remarks on the Introduction of the Slide Principle, 1841; later writers misunderstood, and propagated the error. However, Maudslay did help to disseminate the idea widely. It is highly probable that he saw it when he was working at the Arsenal as a boy. In 1794, whilst he was working for Joseph Bramah, he made one, and when he had his own workshop used it extensively in the lathes he made and sold there. Coupled with the network of engineers he trained, this ensured the <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> became widely known and copied by other lathe makers, and so diffused throughout British engineering workshops. A practical and versatile screw-cutting lathe incorporating the trio of leadscrew, change gears, and <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> was Maudslay's most important achievement.|$|R
40|$|Estimating {{the number}} of {{distinct}} values in a data stream is a vital problem with many applications such as complex join query over multiple data streams. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} continuous and periodic distinct values estimation over sliding windows. We propose a <b>compound</b> <b>sliding</b> window model to compute the distinct values over basic sliding windows in an incremental way. LDV, HDV and AHDV are the three algorithms that are based on <b>compound</b> <b>sliding</b> windows. The basic idea behind the <b>compound</b> <b>sliding</b> windows is to organize the basic windows into a Hash table according to distinct values. Whenever a new data arrives at the data stream, it is inserted into a basic window. Once the basic window is full, a scan using distinct values is executed and the distinct values number is updated incrementally. Theoretical analysis and experiment results show that the distinct values estimation algorithms based on <b>compound</b> <b>sliding</b> windows have a great performance benefits...|$|R
50|$|The first fully documented, {{all-metal}} <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> lathe {{was invented}} by Jacques de Vaucanson around 1751. It was described in the Encyclopédie {{a long time before}} Maudslay invented and perfected his version. It is likely that Maudslay was not aware of Vaucanson's work, since his first versions of the <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> had many errors that were not present in the Vaucanson lathe.|$|R

50|$|Henry Maudslay, {{who trained}} {{a school of}} machine tool makers early in the 19th century, was a {{mechanic}} with superior ability who had been employed at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. He was hired away by Joseph Bramah {{for the production of}} high security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship. Bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> lathe. Maudslay perfected the <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> lathe, which could cut machine screws of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the lead screw. Before its invention screws could not be cut to any precision using various earlier lathe designs, some of which copied from a template. The <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> lathe was called one of history's most important inventions, although not entirely Maudslay's idea.|$|R

50|$|Slides can be {{constructed}} with two sections or multiple sections. A slide with two sections can only extend approximately 3/4 of the total compressed <b>slide</b> length.

A <b>compound</b> <b>slide</b> can extend {{at least as far}} as the compressed slide length and typically a bit more.

5000|$|Meanwhile, English {{instrument}} maker Jesse Ramsden (1735-1800) {{was working}} on the toolmaking and [...] end of the screw-cutting problem, and in 1777 he invented the first satisfactory screw-cutting lathe. The British engineer Henry Maudslay (1771-1831) gained fame by popularizing such lathes with his screw-cutting lathes of 1797 and 1800, containing the trifecta of leadscrew, <b>slide</b> <b>rest,</b> and change-gear gear train, all in the right proportions for industrial machining. In a sense he unified the paths of the Wyatts and Ramsden and did for machine screws what had already been done for wood screws, i.e., significant easing of production spurring commodification. His firm would remain a leader in machine tools for decades afterward. A misquoting of James Nasmyth popularized the notion that Maudslay had invented the <b>slide</b> <b>rest,</b> but this was incorrect; however, his lathes helped to popularize it.|$|R

50|$|A {{critical}} factor in making interchangeable metal parts was the invention of several machine tools, such as the <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> lathe, screw cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine and metal planer.

After the recoil stroke the doughnuts expanded again and the barrel returned into firing position.|$|R
50|$|Maudslay did not {{invent the}} slide-rest (as others such as James Nasmyth have claimed), {{and may not}} have been the first to combine a lead screw, slide-rest, and set of change gears all on one lathe (Jesse Ramsden may have done that in 1775; {{evidence}} is scant), but he did introduce the three-part combination of lead screw, <b>slide</b> <b>rest,</b> and change gears, sparking a great advance in machine tools and in the engineering use of screw threads.|$|R
50|$|The {{bottleneck}} or tube type of slide {{is usually}} worn over the ring (third) or little (fourth) finger, while others wear {{it over the}} middle (second) finger.

However some players feel that they get better control using the ring or middle fingers. Most instructors recommend letting {{one or more of the}} fingers behind the <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> lightly on the strings to help mute unwanted vibrations.|$|R

50|$|Lathes {{have been}} around since ancient times. Adapting them to {{screw-cutting}} is an obvious choice, but {{the problem of how}} to guide the cutting tool through the correct path was an obstacle for many centuries. Not until the late Middle Ages and early modern period did breakthroughs occur in this area; the earliest of which evidence exists today happened in the 15th century and is documented in the Mittelalterliche Hausbuch. It incorporates <b>slide</b> <b>rests</b> and a leadscrew. Roughly contemporarily, Leonardo da Vinci drew sketches showing various screw-cutting lathes and machines, one with two leadscrews. Leonardo also shows change-gears in some of these sketches.|$|R

5000|$|Interchangeability {{of parts}} was {{achieved}} by combining a number of innovations and improvements in machining operations and the invention of several machine tools, such as the <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> lathe, screw-cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine and metal planer. Additional innovations included jigs for guiding the machine tools, fixtures for holding the workpiece in the proper position, and blocks and gauges to check {{the accuracy of the}} finished parts. [...] Electrification allowed individual machine tools to be powered by electric motors, eliminating line shaft drives from steam engines or water power and allowing higher speeds, making modern large scale manufacturing possible. Modern machine tools often have numerical control (NC) which evolved into CNC (computerized numeric control) when microprocessors became available.|$|R
50|$|Ornamental turning is {{believed}} to have originated in Bavaria {{in the latter part of}} the 15th century when it consisted mostly of rose-work, being done by using a cam or template (called a rosette) mounted on the lathe spindle and allowing the headstock to rock under tension of a spring or weight, to follow the contour on the edge of the rosette: also the spindle was allowed to slide to and fro endwise under tension of another spring, or weight, to follow the contour on the face of the rosette. Thus, as the work was rotated it rocked and traversed so that the cutting tool produced wavy lines upon the surface or the cylinder. Before the end of the 18th century, cutting tools were generally hand-held or clamped to a fixed 'rest'. The <b>slide</b> <b>rest,</b> which allows the cutter to <b>slide</b> along the <b>rest</b> under control of a leadscrew, although invented before 1480, was not in general use until much later. It is clear from surviving examples of their work that the skill of the early turners was highly developed.|$|R
5000|$|Important early {{machine tools}} {{included}} the <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> lathe, screw-cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine, pattern tracing lathe, shaper, and metal planer, which {{were all in}} use before 1840. [...] With these machine tools the decades-old objective of producing interchangeable parts was finally realized. An important early example of something now taken for granted was the standardization of screw fasteners such as nuts and bolts. Before about {{the beginning of the}} 19th century, these were used in pairs, and even screws of the same machine were generally not interchangeable. [...] Methods were developed to cut screw thread to a greater precision than that of the feed screw in the lathe being used. This led to the bar length standards of the 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|R

This lathe evolved into the 'queen of machine tools' which {{made it possible to}} turn parts for other machinery. The Holtzapffels developed ornamental turning lathes from the continuous revolution lathe combined with metal-working innovations like the automatic <b>slide</b> <b>rest.</b> These lathes worked from geared patterns to cut designs in hardwoods such as ebony.

50|$|Maudslay {{designed}} a tool holder {{into which the}} cutting tool would be clamped, and which would slide on accurately planed surfaces to allow the cutting tool to move in either direction. The <b>slide</b> <b>rest</b> was positioned by a leadscrew to which power was transmitted through a pair of changeable gears so that it traveled {{in proportion to the}} turning of the work. This allowed screw threads to be precisely cut. Changing the gears gave various pitches. The ability of the slide-rest lathe to produce precision parts revolutionised the production of machine components. He standardized the screw threads used in his workshop and produced sets of taps and dies that would make nuts and bolts consistently to those standards, so that any bolt of the appropriate size would fit any nut of the same size. This was a major advance in workshop technology.|$|R

5000|$|Various machine {{elements}} that potentially lent themselves to screw making (such as the lathe, the leadscrew, the <b>slide</b> <b>rest,</b> gears, <b>slide</b> <b>rests</b> geared direct to spindles, and [...] "change gear" [...] gear trains) were {{developed over the}} centuries, {{with some of those}} elements being quite ancient. Various sparks of inventive power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance combined some of these elements into screw-making machines that presaged the industrial era to follow. For example, various medieval inventors whose names are lost to history clearly worked on the problem, as shown by Wolfegg Castle's Medieval Housebook (written circa 1475-1490), and Leonardo da Vinci and Jacques Besson left us with drawings of screw-cutting machines from the 1500s; not all of these designs are known to have been built, but clearly similar machines were a reality during Besson's lifetime. However, {{it was not until the}} era of 1760-1800 that these various elements were brought together successfully to create (in contemporaneous parallel) two new types of machine tool: the screw-cutting lathe (for low-volume, toolroom-style production of machine screws, with easy selection of various pitches) and the first high-volume-production, specialized, single-purpose machine tools for the production of screws, which were created to produce wood screws screws made of metal for use in wood at high volume and low unit price. Screw-cutting lathes fed into the just-dawning evolution of modern machine shop practice, whereas the wood-screw-making machines fed into the just-dawning evolution of the modern hardware industry, that is, the concept of one factory supplying the needs of thousands of customers, who consumed screws in growing quantities for carpentry, cabinet making, and other trades, but did not make the hardware themselves (purchasing it instead from capital-intensive specialist makers for lower unit cost than they could achieve on their own). These two classes of machine tools simultaneously took the various classes of screws and moved them, for the first time, from the category of expensive, hand-made, seldom-used objects into the category of affordable, often-interchangeable commodity. (The interchangeability developed gradually, from intra-company to inter-company to national to international).|$|R
