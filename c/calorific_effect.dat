50|$|Peltier {{discovered}} the <b>calorific</b> <b>effect</b> of electric current {{passing through the}} junction of two different metals. This is now called the Peltier effect (or Peltier-Seebeck effect). By switching the direction of current, either heating or cooling may be achieved. Junctions always come in pairs, as the two different metals are joined at two points. Thus heat will be moved from one junction to the other.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to evaluate heat sources from thermal field measurements. A modal projection based on dynamics (Discrete Modal Decomposition) is used to estimate the spatial term of a heat diffusion problem. A numerical example is presented in order to validate this approach and compare it to a more classical spectral decomposition (based on thermal considerations). Results show that the proposed projection basis not only provides closer assessment of the heat sources but is also more stable to noise and side effects. Finally, a basis enrichement method is presented and tested. It shows that a priori knowledge of the heat sources shape though approximated (e. g. from strain measurement) enhances the assessement of <b>calorific</b> <b>effects</b> accompanying material deformation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an infrared image processing procedure {{that was developed}} to study <b>calorific</b> <b>effects</b> accompanying material fatigue. This method enables us to separately estimate patterns of thermoelastic and dissipative sources. Heat sources were estimated {{on the basis of}} partial derivative operators present in a local form of the heat equation by using a set of approximation functions that locally fits the temperature field and takes the spectral properties of the sought sources into account. Numerical examples were used to check the validity of the method and to highlight its capabilities along with its limits. The paper concludes with examples of thermal image processing extracted from fatigue tests performed on a dual-phase steel. The coupling sources were compared to the theoretical predictions induced by a basic thermoelastic model, while the heterogeneous character of the fatigue development was highlighted in terms of dissipation sources...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{provides}} the first characterization of heat source {{field in the}} crack tip zone in carbon black filled natural rubber (NR). It focuses more especially on the <b>calorific</b> <b>effects</b> of strain induced. crystallization (SIC). For this purpose, full thermal and kinematic fields are measured simultaneously. Initial image processing based on motion compensation enables us to track the temperature of any material point at the specimen surface. A second image processing stage, based on the heat diffusion equation, enables us to obtain the fields of heat sources produced and absorbed by the material during the test. The heterogeneity of the stretch states is analyzed from the kinematic measurements. In terms of heat production, crystallization acts in two opposite ways in the crack tip zone: the crystallization process produces additional heat, but crystallites act as fillers, which increases material stiffness in the crack tip zone. Moreover, the heat sources in the crack tip zone remain positive and small during unloading. This phenomenon {{is due to the}} production of mechanical dissipation and probably a continuation of the crystallization process. The results attained are compared with those recently obtained in non-crystallizing carbon black filled styrene butadiene rubber (SBR 50). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{catalytic}} {{effect of the}} transition metal ions Cr 2 +, Mn 2 +, Fe 2 +, Co 2 +, Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + on the decarboxylation of Beypazari lignite was investigated, {{in terms of the}} change in calorific values of the decarboxylated lignite samples obtained after the decarboxylation process and activation energies of the decarboxylation processes. The optimum temperature to run the decarboxylation experiments and the optimum concentrations of the metal ion loadings to obtain the highest calorific value coal after decarboxylation reactions were determined. Catalytic activity of Fe 2 +, Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + was relatively higher than those of Cr 2 +, Mn 2 + and Co 2 + ions in decarboxylation reactions. Activation energies of the decarboxylation reactions using different metal ions were calculated and correlated with increases in the <b>calorific</b> values. Catalytic <b>effect</b> of different metal ions were also related to their d-electron configurations of the ions...|$|R
