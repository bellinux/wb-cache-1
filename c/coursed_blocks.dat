On the first story, the granite is finished in rock-faced <b>coursed</b> <b>blocks</b> that are slightly darker in tone than the smooth blocks {{used on the}} remainder of the building.

50|$|The {{abutments}} are 21 {{feet apart}} and {{are supported by}} flanking walls on each side. They are constructed of large <b>coursed</b> <b>blocks</b> of medium to coarse grained and pebbly sandstone with lime mortar. The stone has become considerably weathered, though traces of edge dressing {{can be seen on}} some blocks. Ponding and drips of poured lead are visible between and on the front surface of some blocks.|$|E
50|$|The {{main house}} is {{rectangular}} in plan and is constructed of Toowoomba basalt in rough dressed <b>coursed</b> <b>blocks.</b> The exterior walls are very thick, being double, with a rubble fill, and have rendered brick quoining. The roof is hipped {{with a central}} valley and is clad in English slate and corrugated iron sheeting. The building {{is surrounded by a}} wide verandah with a separate concave roof of corrugated iron supported on timber posts. Wide sandstone steps at the front and sides of the house approach the verandah and the majority of rooms still have access to this verandah through French doors. On the rear verandah, several utility rooms have been formed by enclosing sections with timber walls and sliding glass doors. The verandah floor to the front and sides are timber, while that at the rear is concrete. Attached to the northwest wall of the house is a timber bathroom annexe.|$|E

5000|$|The {{memorial}} {{is situated}} near the western {{corner of the}} park {{at the top of}} a grassy avenue flanked by hedges and eucalypt trees. It is in the form of an obelisk, 20 foot high and square in section composed of <b>coursed</b> <b>blocks</b> of Brisbane tuff (porphyry). It is set on a sloping plinth faced with masonry tiles and is surrounded by a paved area. Bronze memorial tablets beneath bronze laurel wreaths are set low on the sides of the shaft. These are inscribed [...] "In Memory of Fallen Comrades" [...] with the dates beneath commemorating the First and Second World Wars and the Korean, Malaya, Vietnam and Borneo conflicts. The fourth plaque commemorates the dedication of the memorial and is inscribed [...] "Unveiled by his Excellency the Governor of Queensland Lieutenant General Sir John Laverack KBE, CB, CMG, DSO and dedicated by Reverend A G Reilly on 25 April 1951".|$|E

40|$|Describes the Anthropology Department's {{assessment}} {{activities for}} the academic year 2010 - 2011. The Anthropology Department's annual assessment report to the College for the Office of Academic Assessment. There is evidence in the following report of relevant data collection and analysis, discussion of results, and collaboration across the faculty on how to solve problems identified by this year's assessment work. Unique to this year is our dual focus on SLO measurement and the timely assessment of emerging concerns, a combination which allows for both continuity and flexibility. Items 2 A of this report will highlight measurement of undergraduate SLO 7, items 2 B highlight graduate-level SLO 8 measurement, and item 5 provides information on our work on assessing emergent concerns: student performance in ???non traditionally??? scheduled <b>course</b> <b>blocks,</b> i. e., Friday and Saturday blocks, and in online and hybrid courses. The department undertook three critical projects that were highly relevant to student learning: (1) getting {{to the bottom of}} why seniors are entering final seminars with poor writing and research readiness, (2) scaffolding thesis preparation for graduate students, and (3) ensuring quality of <b>course</b> <b>blocks</b> and online learning...|$|R
40|$|A {{proof of}} some precise (usually mathematical) {{statement}} is a convincing {{argument that the}} statement is true. In {{the first part of}} the <b>course</b> (<b>block</b> A), the statements to be proved were given in the form of abstract logical formulas. Whenever a proof of the truth of a formula was requested, it was always made very precise what we would accept as a proof: we either asked for a calculation (a proof according to the methods discussed in part I of the book [1]) or for a derivation (a proof according to the methods discussed in part II of the book [1]). In the second part of the <b>course</b> (<b>block</b> B), the statements to be proved were still formulated as logical formulas, expressing general facts about sets, relations and functions. When proving them, there was a lot more freedom: as proofs we accepted any combination of methods from part I and part II of the book [1], as long as it represented a logically correct reasoning and as as long as it was clear which method was applied where. There is a great advantage of requiring proofs to be presented in a precisely specified format such as a derivation: as soon as one has agreed on the rules and o...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} students' {{academic success}} at {{delivered in a}} traditional continual course, spread over the two semesters, or in alternating <b>course</b> <b>blocks.</b> [...] - METHOD: We analyzed the data on exam grades for Anatomy and Chemistry courses {{in the first year}} of the curriculum for academic year 2001 / 02, with the traditional continual delivery of the courses (n= 253 for chemistry and n= 243 for anatomy), and academic year 2003 / 04, with block delivery of the courses (n= 255 for Chemistry and n= 260 for Anatomy). Grades from the final examination were analyzed only for students who sat the exam at the first available exam term and passed the course. For the Anatomy <b>block</b> <b>course,</b> grades at 2 interim written tests and 2 parts of the final exam (practical stage exam and oral exam) in each block were analyzed for students who passed all interim tests and the final exam. [...] - RESULTS: There were no differences between two types of course delivery in the number of students passing the final examination at first attempt. There was a decrease in passing percentage for the two Anatomy <b>block</b> <b>course</b> student groups in 2003 / 04 (56 % passing students in block 1 vs 40 % in block 2, P= 0. 014). There was an increase in the average grades from 2001 / 02 to 2003 / 04 academic year due to an increase in Chemistry grades (F 1, 399 = 18. 4, P< 0. 001, 2 x 2 ANOVA). There was no effect of the sequence of their delivery (F 1, 206 = 1. 8, P= 0. 182, 2 x 2 ANOVA). There was also a significant difference in grades on interim assessments of Anatomy when it was delivered in the block format (F 3, 85 = 28. 8, P< 0. 001, between-within subjects 2 x 4 ANOVA). [...] - CONCLUSIONS: The type of course delivery was not associated with significant differences in student academic success in Anatomy and Chemistry courses in the medical curriculum. Students can successfully pass these courses when they are delivered either in a continual, whole year format or in a condensed time format of a <b>course</b> <b>block,</b> regardless of the number and type of <b>courses</b> preceding the <b>block</b> <b>course...</b>|$|R
