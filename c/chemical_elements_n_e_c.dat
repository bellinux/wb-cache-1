40|$|Context. Intermediate-mass, {{magnetic}} chemically peculiar (Ap) stars {{provide a}} unique opportunity to study the topology of stellar magnetic fields in detail and to investigate magnetically driven processes of spot formation. Aims. Here we aim to derive the surface magnetic field geometry and chemical abundance distributions for the extraordinary Ap star HD 75049. This object hosts a surface field of ∼ 30 kG, one of the strongest known for any non-degenerate star. Methods. We used time-series of high-resolution HARPS intensity and circular polarisation observations. These data were interpreted with the help of magnetic Doppler imaging and model atmospheres incorporating effects of a non-solar chemical composition and a strong magnetic field. Results. Based on high-precision measurements of the mean magnetic field modulus, we refined the rotational period of HD 75049 to Prot = 4. 048267 ± 0. 000036 d. We also derived basic stellar parameters, Teff = 10250 ± 250 K and log g = 4. 3 ± 0. 1. Magnetic Doppler imaging revealed that the field topology of HD 75049 is poloidal and dominated by a dipolar contribution with a peak surface field strength of 39 kG. At the same time, deviations from the classical axisymmetric oblique dipolar configuration are significant. Chemical surface maps of Si, Cr, Fe, and Nd show abundance contrasts of 0. 5 – 1. 4 dex, which is low compared with many other Ap stars.

The name nitrogen was suggested by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates; this name derives from the Greek roots νἰτρον [...] "nitre" [...] and -γεννᾶν [...] "to form". Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote, from the Greek άζωτικός [...] "no life", as it is an asphyxiant gas; his name is instead used in many languages, such as French, Russian, and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds.|$|R

This report deals with an analysis of the bulk and surface compositions of two of these membranes. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR FTIR) measurements can elucidate the type of polysulfone in the bulk of the membranes.
