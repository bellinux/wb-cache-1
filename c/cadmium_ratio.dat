50|$|The {{rotating}} specimen rack (lazy susan) {{is located}} in a well on top of the graphite reflector which surrounds the core. The rack consists of a circular array of 40 tubular receptacles. Each receptacle can accommodate two TRIGA-type irradiation tubes, so that up to 80 separate samples may be irradiated at any one time. Vials holding up to 17 ml (2.57 cm internal diameter, 10 cm long) are routinely used in this system. Depending upon its geometry, a sample up to about 40 ml could be irradiated by joining two vials. Samples are loaded in the specimen rack prior to the start-up of the reactor. The rack automatically rotates during irradiation to ensure each sample receives the same neutron flux. Typically, the rotating rack is used by researchers when longer irradiation times (generally greater than five minutes) are required. The average thermal neutron flux in the rotating rack position is approximately 2x1012 n/cm2/s with a <b>cadmium</b> <b>ratio</b> of 6.0 at full power. The specimen rack can also be used for gamma irradiations when the reactor is shutdown. The shutdown gamma flux in the specimen rack is approximately 3 R/min.|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of prompt gamma {{neutron activation analysis}} (PGNAA) setup depends on thermal neutron flux available at the sample. Neutrons available in most reactors consist of thermal, epithermal and fast neutrons with varying ratios. As such for PGNAA to be more efficient, {{the ratio of the}} total amount o f neutron to the epifast neutron must be high and this is being measured by the cadmium ratios. In order to increase the neutron flux, a moderator is used. In this study, combination of carbon, lead and silicon were modelled as a moderator to investigate the optimum thickness of moderator combination through a simulation technique. The moderator was tested with varying thickness of material assemblies and {{it was found that the}} combination of 1. 48 cm carbon, 0. 92 cm lead and 4. 40 cm silicon gave the highest <b>cadmium</b> <b>ratio.</b> The Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code version 5 (MCNP 5) and the exact dimension of the tangential beamport of Reactor Triga Puspati, Malaysian Nuclear Agency was used for the simulation purposes. The simulations then were run at seven locations along the tangential beamport in order to determine the position to place the moderator that yield the highest <b>cadmium</b> <b>ratio.</b> The location at 41. 10 cm from the inner beamport exit produced 8. 914 x 107 n cm' 2 s' 1 thermal neutron and 1. 164 x 107 n cm' 2 s ' 1 epi-fast neutron that yield 8. 65 for the <b>cadmium</b> <b>ratio.</b> Consequently, this position could be suggested as the specific position to place the moderators for future PGNAA system at Reactor Triga Puspati. A one meter neutron guide has been proposed to be installed at the end of the moderator to transport the neutron with almost no neutron lost.

Distinct NMR signals from the backbone amides are identified for the apoenzyme and the mononuclear and binuclear cadmium enzymes. For the binuclear cadmium enzyme, two (113) Cd NMR signals (142 and 262 ppm) and two (111 m) Cd PAC nuclear quadrupole interactions are observed. Two nuclear quadrupole interactions are also observed, with approximately equal occupancy, in the PAC spectra at cadmium/enzyme ratios < 1; these {{are different from those}} derived for the binuclear cadmium enzyme, demonstrating interaction between the two metal ion binding sites. In contrast to the observation from PAC spectroscopy, only one (113) Cd NMR signal (176 ppm) is observed at cadmium/enzyme ratios < 1. The titration of the metal site imidazole (N) H proton signals as a function of <b>cadmium</b> ion-to-enzyme <b>ratio</b> shows that signals characteristic for the binuclear cadmium enzyme appear when the <b>cadmium</b> ion-to-enzyme <b>ratio</b> is between 1 and 2, whereas no signals are observed at stoichiometries less than 1. The simplest explanation consistent with all data is that, at cadmium/enzyme ratios < 1, the single Cd(II) is undergoing exchange between the two metal sites on the enzyme.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to investigate the effect of chlorella on cadmium (Cd) toxicity in Cd- administered rats. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats (14 week-old) were blocked into 6 groups. Cadmium chloride was given at levels of 0 or 325 mg (Cd: 0, 160 ppm), and chlorella powder at levels of 0, 3 and 5 %. Cadmium was accumulated in blood and tissues (liver, kidney and small intestine) in the Cd-exposed groups, while the accumulation of Cd was decreased in the Cd-exposed chlorella groups. Fecal and urinary Cd excretions were remarkably increased in Cd-exposed chlorella groups. Thus, <b>cadmium</b> retention <b>ratio</b> and absorption rate were decreased in the Cd exposed chlorella groups. Urinary and serum creatinine, and creatinine clearance were not changed in experimental animals. In addition, metallothionein (MT) synthesis in tissues was increased by Cd administration. The Cd-exposed chlorella groups indicated lower MT concentration compared to the Cd-exposed groups. Moreover, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not changed by dietary chlorella and Cd administration. According to the results above, this study could suggest that Cd toxicity can be alleviated by increasing Cd excretion through feces.

The program was carried out in [fiscal years] 1964, 1965, and 1966. A summary of the program’s effort was compiled in 1967. a The delayed critical experiments were a mockup of a small, potassium-cooled space power reactor for validation of reactor calculations and reactor physics methods. Initial experiments, performed in November and December of 1962, consisted of a core of unmoderated stainless-steel tubes, each containing 26 UO 2 fuel pellets, surrounded by a graphite reflector. Measurements were performed to determine critical reflector arrangements, relative fission-rate distributions, and <b>cadmium</b> <b>ratio</b> distributions.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 In {{this work}} a prompt gamma neutron {{activation}} analysis (PGNAA) facility has been designed, built, and characterized at the Oregon State University TRIGA® reactor. PGNAA is a technique {{used to determine the}} presence and quantity of trace elements such as boron, hydrogen and carbon which are more difficult to detect with other neutron analysis methods. In PGNAA, isotopes are subjected to a neutron beam, resulting in the formation of an unstable compound nucleus. The compound nucleus immediately decays, producing a series of gamma-rays, whose energies are distinctive to each element. These gamma-rays are then measured using an HPGe detector to determine the elemental composition of the sample. The measured thermal and epithermal neutron fluxes of the PGNAA facility at Oregon State University are 2. 81 x 10 ⁷ ± 5. 13 x 10 ⁵ cm⁻²s⁻¹ and 1. 70 x 10 ⁴ ± 3. 11 x 10 ² cm⁻²s⁻¹ respectively.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{the effect of}} long and short term Cd stress in {{chickpea}} plants and evaluates the protective effect of exogenous nitric oxide (NO) supplementation using sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Cadmium treatments were given before sowing (long term stress) and thirty days after germination (short term stress). Sodium nitroprusside was given as foliar spray 30 days after germination to both long and short term Cd treated plants. Cadmium adversely affected the membranes as was evident from increased electrolyte leakage and lipid peroxidation levels. Sodium nitroprusside treatments decreased ion leakage and lipid peroxidation levels significantly. Short term Cd stress resulted in a higher induction of the catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase as compared to long term Cd stress. Nitric oxide showed its positive effect by further increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Cadmium stress also altered the level of antioxidant metabolites by reducing the ascorbate redox ratio (ASC/DHA) and glutathione redox ratio (GSH/GSSG). Sodium nitroprusside treatments increased the redox <b>ratios.</b> <b>Cadmium</b> also adversely affected the seed yield and a greater decline was observed with long term Cd stress as compared to short term Cd stress.

Elevated exposure to cadmium is associated with reduced pulmonary function, obstructive lung disease, bronchogenic carcinoma, cardiovascular diseases including myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, pancreatic cancer, and various oral pathologies. Cadmium and zinc have a toxicologically inverse relationship. Zinc is an essential element and is reportedly antagonistic to some manifestations of cadmium toxicity. This review summarizes associations between blood, urine, and tissue cadmium concentrations with emphasis on cadmium exposure due to tobacco use and several disease states. Available data about zinc and cadmium/zinc ratios and tobacco-related diseases is summarized from studies reporting smoking status. Collectively, data suggest that blood, urine, and tissue <b>cadmium</b> and cadmium/zinc <b>ratios</b> are often significantly different between smokers and nonsmokers and they are also different in smokers for several diseases and cancers. Additional biomonitoring data such as blood or serum and urine zinc and cadmium levels and cadmium/zinc ratios in smokers may provide further insight into the development and progression of diseases of the lung, cardiovascular system, and possibly other organs...|$|R
40|$|Cadmium is an {{environmental}} contaminant which accumulates in the kidney and can potentially affect human health at relatively low concentrations. Biomarkers such as cadmium in urine or blood are normally {{used to assess}} the body burden of cadmium. We studied the relationship between cadmium in urine, blood, and kidney by using 109 healthy environmentally exposed kidney donors. The variability in urinary cadmium excretion, its interpretation, and effects on the study design were further examined using repeated urinary samples from 30 non-smoking healthy men and women. The results showed a strong association between cadmium in urine and kidney (rp= 0. 7), with an excretion corresponding to a biological half-time of about 30 years. A kidney cadmium of 25 μg/g corresponded to a urinary cadmium of 0. 42 μg/g creatinine (i. e. a urine to kidney ratio of 1 : 60). Previous estimates of the urine to kidney <b>cadmium</b> <b>ratio</b> (1 : 20) may thus underestimate the kidney cadmium at low urinary cadmium excretion. On average, 70 % of the urinary cadmium excretion could be explained by kidney cadmium. Urinary cadmium excretion was also affected by cadmium in blood and urinary albumin excretion. There was a circadian rhythm in the urinary cadmium excretion over 24 h, affecting both the interpretation of urinary cadmium measures and the appropriate study design. There was an association between urinary cadmium and urinary proteins within individuals. Hence, when urinary cadmium is used as a biomarker for cadmium body burden, normal short-term variability in renal function may result in an overestimation of the nephrotoxicity of cadmium...|$|E
40|$|Cadmium ratios were {{measured}} with enriched uranium metal foils at various {{locations in the}} assembly with the fuel tube at the 1. 506 -cm spacing. They are described in the following subsections. The experiment configuration {{was the same as}} the first critical configuration described in HEU-COMP-FAST- 004 (Case 1). The experimenter placed 0. 75 -cm-diameter × 0. 010 -cm-thick 93. 15 %- 235 U-enriched uranium metal foils with and without 0. 051 -cm-thick cadmium covers at various locations in the core and top reflector. One part of the cadmium cover was cupshape and contained the uranium foil. The other part was a lid that fit over the exposed side of the foil when it was in the cup shaped section of the cover. As {{can be seen in the}} logbook, two runs were required to obtain all the measurements necessary for the <b>cadmium</b> <b>ratio.</b> The bare foil measurements within the top reflector were run first as part of the axial foil activation measurements. The results of this run are used for both the axial activation results and the cadmium ratios. Cadmium covered foils were then placed at the same location through the top reflector in a different run. Three pairs of bare and cadmium covered foils were also placed through the core tank. One pair was placed at the axial center of a fuel tube 11. 35 cm from the center of the core. Two pairs of foils were placed on top of fuel tubes 3. 02 and 12. 06 cm from the center of the core. The activation of the uranium metal foils was measured after removal from the assembly using two lead shielded NaI scintillation detectors as follows. The NaI scintillators were carefully matched and had detection efficiencies for counting delayed-fission-product gamma rays with energies above 250 KeV within 5 %. In all foil activation measurements, one foil at a specific location was used as a normalizing foil to remove the effects of the decay of fission products during the counting measurements with the NaI detectors. The normalization foil was placed on one NaI scintillator and the other foil on the other NaI detector and the activities measured simultaneously. The activation of a particular foil was compared to that of the normalization foil by dividing the count rate for each foil by that of the normalization foil. To correct for the differing efficiencies of the two NaI detectors, the normalization foil was counted in Detector 1 simultaneously with the foil at position x in Detector 2, and then the normalization foil was counted simultaneously in Detector 2 with the foil from position x in Counter 1. The activity of the foil from position x was divided by the activity of the normalization foil counted simultaneously. This resulted in obtaining two values of the ratio that were then averaged. This procedure essentially removed the effect of the differing efficiencies of the two NaI detectors. Differing efficiencies of 10 % resulted in errors in the ratios measured to less than 1 %. The background counting rates obatined with the foils used for the measurements on the NaI detectors before their irradiation measurement were subtracted from all count rates. The results of the <b>cadmium</b> <b>ratio</b> measurements are given in Table 1. 3 - 1 and Figure 1. 3 - 1. “No correction has been made for self shielding in the foils” (Reference 3) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{critical}} experiments were completed in 1962 - 1965 at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Critical Experiments Facility {{in support of}} the Medium-Power Reactor Experiments (MPRE) program. In the late 1950 ’s efforts were made to study “power plants for the production of electrical power in space vehicles”. The MPRE program was a part of those efforts and studied the feasibility of a stainless steel system, boiling potassium 1 MW(t), or about 140 kW(e), reactor. The program was carried out in [fiscal years] 1964, 1965, and 1966. A summary of the program’s effort was compiled in 1967. The delayed critical experiments were a mockup of a small, potassium-cooled space power reactor for validation of reactor calculations and reactor physics methods. Initial experiments, performed in November and December of 1962, consisted of a core of 253 unmoderated stainless steel tubes, each containing 26 UO 2 fuel pellets, surrounded by a graphite reflector. Measurements were made to determine critical reflector arrangements, fission-rate distributions, and <b>cadmium</b> <b>ratio</b> distributions. “The [assemblies were built] on [a] vertical assembly machine so that the movable part was the core and bottom reflector. ” The first two experiments in the series were evaluated in HEU-COMP-FAST- 001 (SCCA-FUND-EXP- 001) and HEU-COMP-FAST- 002 (SCCA-FUND-EXP- 002). The first experiment had the 253 fuel tubes packed tightly into a 22. 87 cm outside diameter (OD) core tank (References 1 and 2). The second experiment in the series, performed in early 1963, had the 253 fuel tubes at a 1. 506 -cm triangular lattice in a 25. 96 cm OD core tank and graphite reflectors on all sides. The third set of experiments in the series, performed in mid- 1963, which is studied in this evaluation, used beryllium reflectors. The beryllium reflected system was the preferred reactor configuration for this application because of the small thickness of the reflector. The two core configurations had the 253 fuel tubes at a 1. 506 -cm triangular lattice and arranged in 7 -tube clusters. The experiments have been determined to represent acceptable benchmark experiments. Information for this evaluation was compiled from published reports on all three parts of the experimental series (Reference 1 - 5) and the experimental logbook as well as from communication with the experimenter, John T. Mihalczo...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundEpidemiological studies {{indicate}} that cadmium exposure through diet and smoking is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. There are few data {{on the relationship between}} cadmium and plaques, the hallmark of underlying atherosclerotic disease. ObjectivesTo examine the association between exposure to cadmium and the prevalence and size of atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid artery. MethodsA population sample of 4639 Swedish middle-aged women and men was examined in 1991 – 1994. Carotid plaque was determined by B-mode ultrasound. Cadmium in blood was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. ResultsComparing quartile 4 with quartile 1 of blood <b>cadmium,</b> the odds <b>ratio</b> (OR) for prevalence of any plaque was 1. 9 (95 % confidence interval 1. 6 – 2. 2) after adjustment for sex and, age; 1. 4 (1. 1 – 1. 8) after additional adjustment for smoking status; 1. 4 (1. 1 – 1. 7) after the addition of education level and life style factors; 1. 3 (1. 03 – 1. 8) after additional adjustment for risk factors and predictors of cardiovascular disease. No effect modification by sex was found in the cadmium-related prevalence of plaques. Similarly, ORs for the prevalence of small and large plaques were after full adjustment 1. 4 (1. 0 – 2. 1) and 1. 4 (0. 9 – 2. 0), respectively. The subgroup of never smokers showed no association between cadmium and atherosclerotic plaques. ConclusionsThese results extend previous studies on cadmium exposure and clinical cardiovascular events by adding data on the association between cadmium and underlying atherosclerosis in humans. The role of smoking remains unclear. It may both cause residual confounding and be a source of pro-atherogenic cadmium exposure...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project examines the growth dependant properties {{and composition of}} Cadmium Sulfide thin films produced by the Chemical Bath Deposition Method. The specific areas investigated are the effect of deposition temperature, the effect of an Indium dopant on the films structure and properties, {{and the effects of}} post deposition processing such as annealing in air on the film composition. The chemical bath deposition apparatus used has been refined and tested to ensure that the films were grown in a more efficient manner than previously, with more control of the influencing deposition parameters such as temperature. Films grown by the CBD method with this apparatus were durable, yellowish in colour, and adherent to the glass substrates used. The CdS thin films were then subjected to a number of analysis techniques to determine their properties. These techniques include Proton Induced X-ray Emission, Atomic Force Microscopy, Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy, Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy with Charge Contrast Imaging, and Photoconductivity. The results from the analysis of the CdS thin films revealed the presence of nodule structures {{on the surface of the}} annealed films. Films produced at lower deposition temperatures seemed to have increased sulfur deficiencies, resulting in an increased <b>Cadmium</b> to sulfur <b>ratio.</b> The Indium doping was found to be inhomogeneous through the depth of the film. The Indium doping concentration in the deposition was also found to be consistent with the concentration found in the films by analysis. Higher deposition temperatures were found to encourage the deposition of colloidal particulates on the surface of the substrates. Annealing of the CdS was found to produce films with surface features that were rougher in appearance...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Deep-sea bamboo coral (Isidella sp.) SE 000901 A {{from the}} {{southern}} Oregon coast (water depth 1048 m) provides a high-resolution record of variability of North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) and carbon rain to the sea floor, related to coastal upwelling, from 1808 to 2000 AD. Counting of annual layers in magnesium to calcium (Mg/Ca) variations, measured by electron microprobe analysis, yields a detailed age model that is transferred directly to records of carbon and oxygen isotope ratios (δ¹³C and δ¹⁸O) measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry and trace element ratios measured by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). A significant linear relationship between δ¹³C and δ¹⁸O measured on the carbonate internode of the coral specimen revealed disequilibrium kinetic isotopic variations that depend on calcification rate. The stable isotopic time series are significantly correlated to <b>cadmium</b> to calcium <b>ratios</b> (Cd/Ca) in the carbonate internode, suggesting that cadmium uptake also reflects the rate of calcification. Comparison of phosphorus to calcium ratios (P/Ca) in the carbonate internode to historical records of oxygen concentrations of NPIW suggests that coralline P/Ca {{is related to the}} phosphate content of the ambient bottom water, which covaries inversely with oxygen concentration. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios (δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N) were measured on two organic gorgonin nodes of our bamboo coral, but incomplete understanding of the gorgonin growth patterns and the difficulty in translating ages between the proteinaceous node and calcareous internode preclude detailed comparison between organic stable isotopes and the trace element and isotopic composition of the well-dated carbonate proxies. Based on correlation of the measured properties to historical variations in coastal upwelling, and high-latitude climate variability, we demonstrate the potential and challenges in using deep-sea bamboo corals to extend records of climate variability into the pre-historical past...|$|R
