40|$|In the {{presented}} report, the Nernst-Ettingshausen {{effect in}} layered conductors is investigated. Considering a Fermi surface (FS) {{consisting of a}} slightly <b>corrugated</b> <b>cylinder</b> and two corrugated planes distributed periodically in the momentum space, the thermoelectric effects are considered under general assumptions {{for the value of}} a magnetic breakdown probability. As a result of an external generalized force, the FS sheets in layered conductors with a multisheet FS appear to be so close that the charge carriers (as a result of magnetic breakdown) can move from one FS sheet to another. In addition, the distribution functions of the charge carriers and the magnetic breakdown oscillations of thermoelectrical field along the normal to the layer, under different values and orientations of the magnetic field, B, are calculated. It is shown that if the magnetic field is deflected from the xz-plane at an angle φ, the oscillation part of a thermoelectrical field along the normal to the layer under condition sinφ[*]tanϑ>> 1 is mainly determined with the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{resistance}} of layered conductors with a multisheet Fermi surface (FS), {{in a high}} magnetic field, {{in the immediate vicinity}} of Lifshic's topological transition when the separate FS sheets are drown together by an external action, pressure in part (and eventual change of the FS connectivity) is studied theoretically. Analysis of magnetoresistance near topological transition is illustrated for the case of FS in the shape of lightly <b>corrugated</b> <b>cylinder</b> and two corrugated planes distributed with a repeated period in the pulse space. It yields, that as the FS plane sheets approach sufficiently the cylinder, the charge carriers produce a magnetic breakdown of one FS sheet to another, decreasing a sharp anisotropy of magnetoresistance to the in-plane current. Instead of square increase with a magnetic field, the slower resistance growth remains linear in the field within a broad magnetic-field range. In the intimate vicinity of topological transition, when the energy gap between FS layers is negligibly small, the resistance is saturated. Comment: 8 pages, 1 figur...|$|E

40|$|In the {{presence}} of a strong magnetic field, various weakly damped collective Bose modes, most of which have counterparts in the gas approximation, can exist in the plasma of interacting electrons of normal metals at low temperatures. The spin waves predicted by Silin [1] and detected experimentally in alkali metals by Schultz and Dunifer [2] are the type of excitations attributable to correlation effects that is characteristic only of the electron Fermi liquid. In degenerate conductors with a quasi-two-dimen-sional charge carrier energy spectrum, the domain of existence of spin waves is wider than that in metals [3, 4]. In layered conductors with metal-type conductivity, the propagation of spin waves for any direction of the wave vector is possible even under conditions of strong spatial dispersion [4]. This is because the drift velocity of conduction electrons is a quantity of the second order of smallness in low-dimensionality parameter η of the electron energy spectrum at certain orientations of the magnetic field deflected significantly from the layers. As a result, there is no Landau damping and the spin density oscillation decays in the relaxation time in the system of electrons and their spins, i. e., it is undamped in the collisionless limit. Previously, we considered the spin waves in the case where the constant-energy sur-faces are {{in the form of a}} <b>corrugated</b> <b>cylinder</b> with an isotropic spectrum in the plane of the layers. Experi-mental studies of galvanomagnetic effects in layered structures [5, 6], in particular, organic conductors from the family of tetrathiafulvalene salts, show that the Fermi surface (FS) can consist of topologically differ-ent elements, for example, in the form of corrugated planes. In this paper, we investigate the spin waves in lay-ered conductors with an anisotropic charge carrier dis-persion law that admits of open trajectories in p space. Let us consider the following charge carrier disper-sion law...|$|E
40|$|Anisotropic surfaces, {{obtained}} by corrugating conducting smooth surfaces, {{have been widely}} used in realizing high-frequency antennas. For instance, special efforts have been made in designing and analyzing artificially hard and soft surfaces [Kildal 1990], often realized by periodically corrugating metallic surfaces and then filling the corrugations with a dielectric material. In this context, a problem of remarkable importance is the scattering from <b>corrugated</b> <b>cylinders</b> of different cross-sections, which can be used for realizing low-blockage feed-support struts in the design of high performance reflector antennas. From a practical point of view, in order to avoid calculating the field inside corrugations, equivalent surface impedances are defined at the outer surface of the cylinder. The range of validity of this kind of approximation cannot be easily determined, and the availability of rigorous reference solutions is of great importance for validating approximate procedures. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to derive a rigorous modal solution for the case of circular cross-section cylinders with longitudinal corrugation...|$|R

40|$|The {{utilisation}} of elemental auxiliary sources located {{inside the}} scatterer {{in order to}} approximately describe the scattered field {{has proved to be}} an efficient numerical method for the analysis of electromagnetic (EM) scattering by metallic bodies. In this paper the problem of TM scattering by perfectly conducting cylinders of arbitrary but smooth cross section is treated with the integration of the above technique with the strategy of Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimisation. The GA is employed in order to allocate the auxiliary sources inside the scatterer and minimise the boundary condition error (BCE), which is an endogenous effect of the point matching procedure involved in the numerical solution. For such a case, the trial and error stage usually required for the selection of the source locations is omitted {{and at the same time}} GA stochastic search can be potentially conducted in a similar way in complex space. For a predefined accuracy of the BCE, the resulting pleiotropic, GA-optimised allocations of the sources are non-intuitive but notably affected by the geometry of the scatterer.

40|$|Summary form only given. The {{plane wave}} {{scattering}} from perfectly conducting periodically loaded or <b>corrugated</b> <b>cylinders</b> at skew incidence {{can be analyzed}} by several methods, according to the geometrical and material properties of the scatterer. Two basic configurations recur in practical applications, with the corrugations or loading; either along the z axis of the cylinder or in the transverse plane. This latter case can be solved by exploiting the periodicity of the structure along the cylinder axis. Since the scatterer is a periodic function of z with period d, the fields observed at two arbitrary points, separated by a distance d along a line parallel to the z-axis, are identical except for a constant phase shift. This means {{that it is necessary}} to determine the fields only in a basic cell of the periodic cylindrical structure, which is enclosed by the planes z= plusmn;d/ 2. In this paper, different methods for the analysis of the problem are discussed and compared, both in the cases of longitudinal and transverse loadings. Particular attention is devoted to the case of transverse corrugations or loadings. In this context, a special formulation of the method of moments is applied, which utilizes a periodical free-space Green's function. When the cylinder cross section is circular, typical Floquet's modal expansions are also considered. Finally, in the presence of more complex configurations a hybrid technique is used, which combines the finite element method (FEM) with the Floquet's expansio...|$|R

When two parallel plates with corrugations are situated close to each other, besides the usual Casimir attraction that takes place between them [1], there exists another contribution to the attraction that depends on the corrugations of the surface of the plates and therefore, on the non-normal coordinates (in the case of the parallel plates this coordinate is along the paralle...|$|R

In the solution, the corrugations are replaced with polarization currents that are identical to those of the local tangential periodic corrugated surface, and the stratified cylinder is replaced with equivalent surface currents. New expressions for the equivalent physical-optics currents are used which are more convenient than the standard ones.

40|$|AbstractA {{conformal}} {{method is}} developed for generating solutions of Laplace's equation which satisfy the radiation boundary condition at a smooth convoluted surface, {{such as the}} membrane of a cell which is steadily absorbing a diffusing substance. It is shown that almost all solutions which are analytic {{in the neighborhood of}} the surface have one or more branch points somewhere outside the surface, and are therefore not admissible in general; this feature presents a difficulty for both analytical and numerical methods of solution. In two-dimensional problems the difficulty can be overcome by the superposition of solutions in two sheets of the complex plane, and a complete set of admissible solutions is obtained in this way. The method is illustrated by its application to <b>corrugated</b> planes and <b>cylinders,</b> where exact solutions, free of singularities, are obtained in terms of elliptic functions. It is shown that methods of obtaining radiation surfaces from analytical solutions may encounter analogous difficulties. An extension of the conformal method to three-dimensional problems is given and illustrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{storage of}} {{compressive}} loaded boxes {{in an environment}} with naturally varying humidity is a practical issue in corrugated board employment. Time dependent variables such as moisture content, strain fields, stress fields and material strength play important roles for the time to failure. Supplementary, the stochastic nature of material and moisture load is obstructing the prediction of a reliable measure of lifetime. This work is composed {{of a number of}} portion proposals, each aiming on a method for a specific subproblem of the numerical modelling of time to failure. Firstly, the focus is the problem of finite deformation hygro-elasticity. The assumption of kinematics is based on an additive split of the stretch in an elastic part and a non-elastic part. In time stepping sequences the elastic stretch is updated by the use of the total stretch from the polar decomposed deformation gradient. As a consequence, in the linearized virtual work equation appears a hygroscopic contribution to the stiffness matrix as well as a hygroscopic load vector. Particularly, a numerical procedure for analyzing layered shells is developed. Further, a numerical method for the transient moisture flow in porous cellulosic materials like paper and wood is examined. The derivation of the model is based on mass conservation for a mixture containing a vapour phase and an adsorbed water phase embedded in a porous solid material. A model for the development of higher order sorption hysteresis is also developed. The model is capable of describing cyclic hardening as well as cyclic softening of the equilibrium water concentration. The model is verified by comparison with the measured response to natural variations in temperature and humidity. A close agreement of the simulated results to measured data is found. The reliability of geometrically non-linear composite shells is studied by use of the First Order Reliability Method (FORM). A finite difference method is employed in order to find the gradients of the limit state function. A failure stress criterion for corrugated board facings is also proposed. The failure criterion is based on material failure and structural local buckling failure. The structural failure stress is evaluated using a novel analytical solution for the buckling of long orthotropic plates under combined in-plane loading. The failure stress is compared with collapse experiments on <b>corrugated</b> board <b>cylinders</b> and the failure stress presented herein is seen to be in significantly better agreement with the measured stresses than the Tsai-Wu failure criterion alone. Alongside with the numerical predictive methods, a number of testing procedures on individual paper materials and corrugated board boxes are performed. Firstly, mechanical second order stochastic field parameters of liner and fluting materials are estimated for a variety of materials used for commercial boards. Secondly, reliability testing of corrugated board boxes in a natural dynamic humidity environment is performed. A large number of boxes are loaded with a constant compressive force in an untempered airy indoor climate. Contemporary with the record of time to failures, the moisture transport in individual paper sheets and a sealed corrugated board box is measured...|$|R
