In 1998, Luczo and CTO Tom Porter characterized the organizational redesign of design centers into core teams organized around individual projects, to meet the <b>corporate</b> <b>objective</b> of faster time to market. As the CEO, Luczo decided to increase investment in technology, and to diversify into faster-growing, higher-margin businesses. He decided to implement a highly automated platform strategy for manufacturing. Between 1997 and 2004, Seagate reduced its headcount from approximately 111,000 to approximately 50,000, rationalized its factory footprint from 24 factories to 11 factories and reduced design centers form seven to three. During this period, Seagate output increased from approximately 9 million drives per quarter to approximately 20 million drives per quarter.|$|E

40|$|This- very preliminary- paper {{presents}} a {{first attempt at}} researching <b>corporate</b> <b>objectives.</b> paper reviews the sparse literature on <b>corporate</b> <b>objectives</b> and derives some hypotheses which are tested on a data set covering questionaries on other data on 71 Danish firms. The findings {{are found to be}} broadly compatible with agency theory. <b>Corporate</b> <b>objectives</b> vary substantially across firms. They are significantly influenced by ownership and industry structure. In particular, ownership diversification leads to greater emphasis on market based objectives (shareholder value). However, in general volatile market-based objectives are given relatively low priority perhaps because stock prices are more volatile (low signal noise ratio). In contrast R&D is emphasized more in companies that are active in research presumably because R&D matters more in these firms so that R&D objectives are more informative. Objectives that are highly correlated with other measures (and therefore presumably add less new information) are also given lower priority. 1 Paper prepared for presentation at the link-workshop October 26 - 27 2000, Copenhagen Business School.

40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been {{computational}} and theoretical advances in the analysis both of the equilibrium and of the disequilibrium properties of pricing models in which spatial markets are dominated by autonomous firms engaged in oligopolistic competition. In this paper I develop an approach to the modeling of spatial pricing that transcends the unrealistic institutional simplification that firms are autonomous and independent of corporate organizational structures. Specifically, I hypothesize that competition between corporations takes place at two spatial scales. At the intraurban scale, corporations compete for market share through their franchise sites, where market share is contingent upon the nature and degree of competition between franchises, the spatial structure of the urban market, {{and the costs of}} production to the franchise. At the intraurban scale, competition is defined in terms of the strategies of the individual corporations as they adjust their delivered prices to urban markets in response to changes in their costs of production and distribution, the interurban transportation network, and the achieved market share in each urban market. I demonstrate that, for a general <b>corporate</b> <b>objective,</b> there exists at least one spatial price equilibrium and that the stability conditions of this model are identical for two price-setting scenarios: a partial adjustment model and a Bertrand game. For the specific <b>corporate</b> <b>objective</b> of total profit maximization, I examine the qualitative properties of the hierarchical model. ...|$|E
