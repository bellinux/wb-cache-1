Note that in traditional electric circuits constructed from metal wires, current flow is created by the motion of negatively charged electrons, which actually flow from cathode to anode. However, in biological systems, such as the head, current is usually created by the flow of ions, which may be positively or negatively charged—positive ions will flow towards the cathode; negative ions will flow toward the anode.

When joining a car body, the method of welding dissimilar three sheets, including high strength steel is frequently used. Studies on the dissimilar welding of high strength steel and low carbon steel are being conducted in an attempt to improve the weldability. However, the dissimilar welding of TWIP steel with other steel grades is extremely challenging due to the high resistivity of the base metal.

This {{thesis is}} about the dynamic control of a {{permanent}} magnet assisted reluctance synchronous machine (PMA RSM). The PMA RSM in this thesis is a 110 kW traction machine and is ideal for the use in electrical rail vehicles. An application of the dynamic control of the PMA RSM in electrical rail vehicles is to reduce wheel slip. The mathematical model of the PMA RSM is derived and explained in physical terms. Two methods of <b>current</b> <b>control</b> for the PMA RSM are investigated, namely <b>constant</b> field <b>current</b> <b>control</b> (CFCC) and <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> angle <b>control</b> (CCAC). It is shown that CCAC is more appropriate for the PMA RSM. A current controller for the PMA RSM that guarantees stability is derived and given as an analytic formula. This current controller {{can be used for}} any method of <b>current</b> <b>control,</b> i. e. CFCC or CCAC. An accurate simulation model for the PMA RSM is obtained using results from finite element analysis (FEA). The accurate model is used in a simulation to verify CCAC. A normal proportional integral speed controller for the PMA RSM is designed and the design is also verified by simulation. Practical implementation of the current and speed controllers is considered along with a general description of the entire drive system. The operation of the resolver (for position measurement) is given in detail. Important safety measures and the design of the electronic circuitry to give protection are shown. Practical results concerning <b>current</b> and speed <b>control</b> are then shown. To improve the dynamic performance of the PMA RSM, a load torque observer with compensation current feedback is investigated.

The accurate simulation model of the PMA RSM is used to verify the operation of the observer structures and to evaluate the dynamic performance. Both observer structures are implemented practically and practical results are shown. One method of position sensorless control, namely the high frequency voltage injection method, is discussed in terms of the PMA RSM.

Nowadays there are some problems existed in the spot welding industry, which includes low welding precision, low welding quality, small welding range and low anti-disturbance capability. The problems are caused by a lot of elements, among these elements; the most important one is low precision of welding current control. So how to control the welding current accurately is the problem we need to solve. Since 8 bit microcontroller system and 32 bit microcontroller have disadvantages in designing the RSW controller. 16 bit microcontroller plus DSP is a cost-effective chip to design the RSW control platform, it can implement not only the close loop control but also the complex welding control algorithm. It satisfies the requirement to control output welding current accurately. In this thesis the hardware system based on the 16 bit digital signal controller (DSC) dsPIC 30 F 6014 is designed and implemented, the system is comprised of signal input, signal output, user interface, communication, alarm and power six module. The hardware system is a cost-effective system that can implement the close loop control with complex algorithm.

40|$|Nonlinear systems, such as {{switching}} DC-DC boost or buck converters, have rich dynamics. A simple one-dimensional discrete-time {{model is}} {{used to analyze the}} boost or buck converter in discontinuous conduction mode. Seven different control schemes (open-loop power stage, voltage mode <b>control,</b> <b>current</b> mode <b>control,</b> <b>constant</b> power load, <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> load, constant-on-time <b>control,</b> and boundary conduction mode) are analyzed systematically. The linearized dynamics is obtained simply by taking partial derivatives with respect to dynamic variables. In the discrete-time model, there is only a single pole and no zero. The single closed-loop pole is a linear combination of three terms: the open-loop pole, a term due to the control scheme, and a term due to the non-resistive load. Even with a single pole, the phase response of the discrete-time model can go beyond - 90 degrees as in the two-pole average models. In the boost converter with a resistive load under <b>current</b> mode <b>control,</b> adding the compensating ramp has no effect on the pole location. Increasing the ramp slope decreases the DC gain of control-to-output transfer function and increases the audio-susceptibility.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel, cost {{effective}} grid-connected inverter for a domestic micro {{combined heat and power}} (micro-CHP) system. A high frequency (~ 12, 000 rpm), high voltage (~ 425 Vdc) brushless DC (BLDC) machine {{is used as}} the generator. The output of the generator is injected into the grid through a novel grid-connected inverter, utilizing a digital algorithm for the implementation of a <b>constant</b> frequency hysteresis <b>current</b> <b>control.</b> This allows a simplified output filter with smaller components to be employed. A grid synchronization method has also been designed, based on a low-pass filter and a micro-controller to optimize/tune the output power factor. The proposed method is successfully applied to a 500 W, 230 V, 50 Hz grid-connected voltage source inverter (VSI) prototype, where the output of the VSI has been demonstrated to comply with the operating regulations of the domestic distributed power generation systems.
