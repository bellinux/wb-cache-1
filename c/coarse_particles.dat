5|$|Ash fallout occurs {{immediately}} after the eruption and is controlled by particle density. Initially, <b>coarse</b> <b>particles</b> fall out close to source. This is followed by fallout of accretionary lapilli, {{which is the result}} of particle agglomeration within the column. Ash fallout is less concentrated during the final stages as the column moves downwind. This results in an ash fall deposit which generally decreases in thickness and grain size exponentially with increasing distance from the volcano. Fine ash particles may remain in the atmosphere for days to weeks and be dispersed by high-altitude winds. These particles can impact on the aviation industry (refer to impacts section) and, combined with gas particles, can affect global climate.|$|E

2500|$|The size {{distribution}} of {{gravel and sand}} particles are typically measured using sieve analysis. The formal procedure is described in ASTM D6913-04(2009). A stack of sieves with accurately dimensioned holes between a mesh of wires is used to separate the particles into size bins. A known volume of dried soil, with clods broken down to individual particles, is put {{into the top of}} a stack of sieves arranged from coarse to fine. The stack of sieves is shaken for a standard period of time so that the particles are sorted into size bins. This method works reasonably well for particles in the sand and gravel size range. [...] Fine particles tend to stick to each other, and hence the sieving process is not an effective method.

40|$|In this report, we {{reviewed}} {{the differences in}} the ecosystem services of coastal and inland areas surrounding 39 Sake breweries in Chiba Prefecture by investigating environmental variables (e. g., location, altitude, soil, and hardness of preparation water). The Sake breweries were located in three distinct environments: the coastal vicinity, the river plains region, and the plateau/ mountainous region. The hardness of the preparation water and the soil types in the coastal vicinity were compared with those of the river plains and the plateau/mountainous region. Strong hard and hard water sources were observed in 70 % or more of the breweries in the coastal vicinity, and sand dune regosol, <b>coarse</b> <b>particle</b> brown lowland soil, and <b>coarse</b> <b>particle</b> grey soil were more prevalent along the coast than inland. Most of the Sake brewery wells in the coastal vicinity were approximately 5 - 10 munderground, and there were no great differences in the number of Sake breweries in each well depth class in the river plains and the plateau/mountains region. We analysed environmental factors (distance from the sea, soil type, water hardness and preparation water collection depth) using a principal component analysis. This analysis revealed the existence of three main environments: the coastal vicinity, the river plains and the plateau/mountainous region. We conclude that the decrease in altitude between the inland Sake breweries and those along the coast is accompanied by a corresponding increase in the hardness of preparation water (from soft water to strong hard or hard water) and shifts in soil composition from gley soil, grey lowland soil, brown forest soil, and andosol to sand dune regosol, <b>coarse</b> <b>particle</b> brown lowland soil, and <b>coarse</b> <b>particle</b> grey soil. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The city of Phnom Penh is {{experiencing}} growth and, with this growth, an increased level {{of air pollution}} {{in the form of}} airborne particles that are attributed to increased vehicle traffic in the city – vehicular exhaust and re-entrained dust. For this study, airborne particulates were counted and sorted using a six-channel laser particle counter. Initial sample counts were taken at 88 sites within the city of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on days representative of dry season conditions. A subset of 33 sites was re-sampled on a day representative of the wet season. Objectives of this study are to provide a baseline count for airborne particulates in the city of Phnom Penh, and to explore the characteristics of the particulate counts utilizing summary statistics and maps. The median Phnom Penh city-wide fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>particle</b> counts are 1. 07 * 108 /m 3 and 1. 36 * 106 /m 3, respectively. While the fine particle count can be attributed to vehicle exhaust, the <b>coarse</b> <b>particle</b> count is attributed to re-entrained road dust and dirt roads. The overall <b>coarse</b> <b>particle</b> count is influenced by a number of hot spots across the city. Selective paving of these hot spots will greatly reduce the level of airborne coarse particulates. Key words: Phnom Penh, Cambodia, particulates, particle counter, air pollution...|$|R
