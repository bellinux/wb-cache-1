5000|$|... 4-HO-MET is a class A {{drug in the}} UK, as {{a result}} of the {{tryptamine}} <b>catch-all</b> <b>clause.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{countries}} {{contain a}} [...] "substantially similar" [...] <b>catch-all</b> <b>clause</b> in their drug law, such as New Zealand and Australia. This includes 6-APB {{as it is}} similar in chemical structure to the class A drug MDA, meaning 6-APB {{may be viewed as}} a controlled substance analogue in these jurisdictions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{application}} for rescission of the default judgment {{is being made}} by a person other than those referred to in 1, 2 or 3 above. This is a <b>catch-all</b> <b>clause</b> for rescission of default judgments. The application must be supported by affidavit, and set out {{the reasons why the}} applicant seeks rescission of the default judgment.|$|E
40|$|Several linear-time {{algorithms}} for automata-based {{pattern matching}} rely on failure transitions for efficient back-tracking. Like epsilon transitions, failure transition do not consume input symbols, but unlike them, they {{may only be}} taken when no other transition is applicable. At a semantic level, this conveniently models <b>catch-all</b> <b>clauses</b> and allows for compact language representation. This work investigates the transition-reduction problem for deterministic finite-state automata (DFA). The input is a DFA A and an integer k. The question is whether k or more transitions can be saved by replacing regular transitions with failure transitions. We show that while the problem is NP-complete, there are approximation techniques and heuristics that mitigate the computational complexity. We conclude by demonstrating the computational difficulty of two related minimisation problems, thereby cancelling the ongoing search for efficient algorithms...|$|R
5000|$|On 18 October 2012 the ACMD {{released}} a report about MXE, saying that the [...] "harms of methoxetamine are commensurate with Class B of the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971)", {{despite the fact that}} the act does not classify drugs based on harm. The report went on to suggest that all analogues of MXE should also become class B drugs and suggested a <b>catch-all</b> <b>clause</b> covering both existing and unresearched arylcyclohexamines.|$|E
5000|$|On October 18, 2012 the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs in the United Kingdom {{released}} a report about methoxetamine, saying that the [...] "harms of methoxetamine are commensurate with Class B of the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971)", {{despite the fact that}} the act does not classify drugs based on harm. The report went on to suggest that all analogues of Methoxetamine should also become class B drugs and suggested a <b>catch-all</b> <b>clause</b> covering both existing and unresearched arylcyclohexamines, including 3-MeO-PCE.|$|E
50|$|Bromo-DragonFLY {{is widely}} {{reported}} by the media as being a class A drug. However, as of 2014, it remains unclear to what extent it is covered by the UK phenylethylamine <b>catch-all</b> <b>clause,</b> with commentators noting both the structural similarities and differences to the phenylethylamine class. If the prosecution could demonstrate structural similarity in court, it {{would be considered a}} Class A substance but as a benzodifuran it is significantly different to this class. It is not explicitly named in the misuse of drugs act. It would be covered by the UK Psychoactive Substances Act 2016.|$|E
40|$|The Armed Career Criminal Act (2 ̆ 2 ACCA 2 ̆ 2) {{supplements}} states’ {{law enforcement}} efforts against chronic violent offenders by substantially raising {{the penalty for}} armed criminals with past “violent felony” convictions. The ACCA defines the term “violent felony” by giving several specific examples and then adding a <b>catch-all</b> <b>clause.</b> One question that has continued to face courts since the ACCA’s enactment is what constitutes a violent felony under the <b>catch-all</b> <b>clause.</b> The Seventh Circuit recently categorized the offense of drunk driving as a “violent felony” under the <b>catch-all</b> <b>clause</b> and qualified drunk driving as a predicate act subject to recidivist sentence enhancement under the ACCA. In light of drunk driving’s non-violent nature, however, the Seventh Circuit’s expansion of the ACCA’s predicate acts blurs the distinction between crimes of violence and crimes of neglect and allows excessive penalties to be imposed on crimes that Congress did not intend for heightened punishment. This Comment examines the Seventh Circuit’s broad interpretation and concludes that the Seventh Circuit should not have enlarged the ACCA’s predicate acts to include negligent drunk driving...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of copyright law are dual, i. e., {{to protect the}} interests of copyright holders and to promote affordable access to works. The regime of fair use is an important mechanism to achieve {{the balance of the}} two aspects. The fair use regime in Chinese copyright law is a closed model and some of the provisions are rigid, which cannot meet the demand of the society. The draft of the third copyright law revision proposes a <b>catch-all</b> <b>clause</b> which would change the regime from being closed to open. However, it fails to provide a clear criterion which can ensure the certainty of law. By contrast, Chinese courts show their flexibility in recognizing fair use and the remedies thereafter, especially in recognizing new circumstances of fair use beyond the law. This phenomenon, however, has not received the attention it deserves as it has great significance for copyright law overall. The literature in both Chinese and English on this phenomenon is quite limited. On the basis of a comprehensive review of the cases regarding fair use recognition, this thesis finds that in spite of the closed model and rigid provisions in legislation, the Chinese judiciary has applied existing provisions in a flexible manner. The flexibility is reflected in three aspects: the courts make expansionary or restricted interpretations according to practical needs; they determine new situations of fair use beyond the statute on various grounds, including the US-style four-factor analysis, {{objectives of}} the copyright law, principles of the civil law and customary practices; when deciding remedies and compensations, judges take account of various considerations to achieve a balance of interests, which also brings a certain degree of flexibility. The contrast between rigidity of legislation and flexibility in judicial practices is remarkable as well as puzzling. This thesis tries to explain this phenomenon {{in the context of the}} legislative history of Chinese copyright law and judicial tradition. It is argued that the hybrid characteristic of copyright law provides the ideological foundation of flexible application in trials, and the pragmatic judicial tradition provides the institutional conditions. The flexible practices are not occasional acts of individual judges, but reasonable collective choices of the judiciary system to achieve copyright objectives in the digital economy, i. e., the balance of interests of copyright holders and the public. These practices, however, have caused concerns due to the illegitimacy of judges’ discretion and uncertainty of the law. As a response, this thesis recommends a <b>catch-all</b> <b>clause</b> to clarify the open status of the fair use regime in Chinese Copyright Law during its third revision. It suggests that, in order to achieve the balance of flexibility and legal certainty, the following changes should be considered: (1) adding a general fair use clause which contains specific factors for judges’ consideration; (2) providing the flexibility for the use of the work of others for creation; and (3) adding mature categories of fair use which are summarized from the judicial experiences to the list of permissible acts. published_or_final_versionLawMasterDoctor of Legal Studie...|$|E
