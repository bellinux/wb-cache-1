40|$|Deuterium {{labelling}} experiments {{reveal a}} remarkably different hydrogen addition mode during homogeneously catalysed C=C bond reduction of itaconic acid derivatives 1 a-d using molecular hydrogen (hydrogenation) or formic acid/triethylamine (transfer hydrogenation). The expected vicinal addition of two hydrogen atoms across the double bond prevails for all substrates in conventional hydrogenation, whereas the deuterium pattern {{depends largely on}} the nature of the carboxyl group in the beta (or allylic) position during transfer hydrogenation. Vicinal addition is observed only in case of itaconic acid 1 a and alpha-methylitaconate 1 c, while 1, 3 -addition is preferred with dimethylitaconate 1 b and beta-methylitaconate 1 d. Significant amounts of polydeuterated products are formed also during hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation. Monitoring the deuterium pattern as a function of time reveals that deuterium scrambling is responsible for polydeuteration, but not for the change of the addition mode. The use of monodeuterated formic acid isotopomers shows that the incorporation from the hydridic formyl position occurs preferentially at the terminal end of the double bond (C- 3) whereas the protic hydrogen is directed either in the higher substituted olefinic (C- 2) or the methylene (C- 1) position. Control experiments using mesaconic (2) and <b>citraconic</b> (3) <b>acids</b> demonstrate that double bond migration in 1 a-d is negligible under the reaction conditions. These results are best rationalised on the basis of a common mechanism for hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation that involves (i) the generation of Rh H intermediates, (ii) reversible hydride transfer to coordinated substrate to form two isomeric sigma-alkyl intermediates, and (iii) irreversible product liberation through protolytic Rh-C cleavage. The key intermediates are similar if not identical for hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation. The change of the hydrogen transfer pattern can be explained on the basis of the relative rates of the individual steps within the catalytic cycle as compared to the rate of isomerisation of the sigma-alkyl intermediates...|$|R

At these slightly basic conditions, primary amines are nucleophilic and will readily react with the added anhydride reagent. As the reaction proceeded, the pH of the solution dropped, slowing the reaction rate.

As anhydride reagent was depleted, the pH change slowed or stopped. Additional aliquots of <b>citraconic</b> <b>acid</b> (up to 10 for the system described here) were added and the cycle repeated.

CJ-PEGBT was synthesized by linking pentynoic acid and <b>citraconic</b> <b>acid</b> to inulin. The citraconylamide pendants, used as pH reversible spacer, were exploited to further conjugate doxorubicin, whereas the alkyne moiety was orthogonally functionalized with an azido PEG-biotin derivative by copper(II) catalyzed 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition. DSC measures, AFM, and UV spectrophotometry were employed to systematically investigate adsorption of CJ-PEGBT onto RGO and its physicochemical stability in aqueous media, demonstrating that a stable π-staked nanosystem can be obtained.

40|$|Clarification of the {{metabolic}} mechanisms underlying salt stress responses in plants will allow further optimization of crop breeding and cultivation to obtain high yields in saline-alkali land. Here, we characterized 68 differential metabolites of cultivated soybean (Glycine max) and wild soybean (Glycine soja) under neutral-salt and alkali-salt stresses using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) -based metabolomics, {{to reveal the}} physiological and molecular differences in salt tolerance. According to comparisons of growth parameters under the two kinds of salt stresses, the level of inhibition in wild soybean was lower than in cultivated soybean, especially under alkali-salt stress. Moreover, wild soybean contained significantly higher amounts of phenylalanine, asparagine, <b>citraconic</b> <b>acid,</b> citramalic acid, citric acid and α-ketoglutaric acid under neutral-salt stress, and higher amounts of palmitic acid, lignoceric acid, glucose, citric acid and α-ketoglutaric acid under alkali-salt stress, than cultivated soybean. Further investigations demonstrated that the ability of wild soybean to salt tolerance was mainly based on the synthesis of organic and amino acids, and the more active tricarboxylic acid cycle under neutral-salt stress. In addition, the metabolite profiling analysis suggested that the energy generation from β-oxidation, glycolysis and the citric acid cycle plays important roles under alkali-salt stress. Our results extend the understanding of mechanisms involved in wild soybean salt tolerance and provide an important reference for increasing yields and developing salt-tolerant soybean cultivars...|$|E
30|$|Polycarboxylic acids form ester cross-links through {{esterification}} reaction with hydroxyl {{groups of}} cellulose, {{in the presence}} of selective weak catalysts such as alkali metal salts of phosphorous containing inorganic acids, e.g. sodium hypophosphite providing high level of resiliency when cured, imparting wrinkle resistance and smooth drying properties without producing any bad odour and stiff handle. Citric acid is the most extensively studied polycarboxylic acid having advantage of being inexpensive, wide availability, non-toxic and environmentally acceptable. It shows only moderate effectiveness as durable press finishing agent due to the presence of an α-hydroxyl group in its molecule which hinders its esterification with cellulose (Andrews 1990; Andrews et al. 1993; Bhattacharyya et al. 1999; Kittinaovarut 2003; Schramm and Rinderer 2000; Welch and Peters 1997; Yatagai and Takahashi 2005, 2006). Yellowing of fabric occurs at high curing temperatures (> 175  °C) causing dehydration of the citric acid through formation of unsaturated polycarboxylic acids, such as aconitic acid, <b>citraconic</b> <b>acid</b> and itaconic acid; but exposing in open atmospheric moisture reverses the heat induced yellowing process to original whiteness (Choi 1993; Murray 1995; Schramm and Rinderer 1999; Welch and Peters 1999, 2000, 2002). During curing in presence of a catalyst, citric acid forms ester linkage (Welch and Peters 1997; Bhattacharyya et al. 1999); cross-links between two cellulose chains firstly by formatting a 5 -membered cyclic anhydride as reactive intermediate and then the reaction between cellulose and anhydride intermediate, which is pH dependent (Yang et al. 2000).|$|E

In addition to early detection, close monitoring of disease progression in CRC can be critical for patient prognosis and treatment decisions. Efforts have been made to develop new methods for improved early detection and patient monitoring; however, research focused on CRC surveillance for treatment response and disease recurrence using metabolomics has yet to be reported. In this proof of concept study, we applied a targeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolic profiling approach focused on sequential metabolite ratio analysis of serial serum samples to monitor disease progression from 20 CRC patients. The use of serial samples reduces patient to patient metabolic variability. A partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model using a panel of five metabolites (succinate, N 2, N 2 -dimethylguanosine, adenine, <b>citraconic</b> <b>acid,</b> and 1 -methylguanosine) was established, and excellent model performance (sensitivity[*]=[*] 0. 83, specificity[*]=[*] 0. 94, area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) [*]=[*] 0. 91 was obtained, which is superior to the traditional CRC monitoring marker carcinoembryonic antigen (sensitivity[*]=[*] 0. 75, specificity[*]=[*] 0. 76, AUROC[*]=[*] 0. 80).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the synthesis and characterization of optically active polyaniline its derivatives. The novel optically active emeraldine salts PAn. (+) -or (-) -HCSA and PAn. (-) -HCSA were prepared as dark green films via the enantioactive electropolymerization of aniline {{in the presence}} of (+) -or (-) -HCSA, respectively. The two films PAn. (+) - or (-) -HCSA and PAn. (-) -HCSA exhibited strong mirror imaged CD spectra. This was rationalised in terms of the polyaniline chain adopting a helical structure in which one screw-sense is preferentially maintained depending on which hand of the CSA- anion is incorporated. The electrochemically synthesised chiral polyanilines were characterized using electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical quartz microbalance, and resistometry. Different electrochemical techniques could be employed for the electrosynthesis of the polymers, namely potentiostatic, potentiodynamic and galvanostatic polymerization, giving films with similar chiroptical, electrochemical and mechanical properties. Dedoping and redoping of the optically active emeraldine salts PAn. (+) -HCSA were studied using both cyclic voltammetry and chemical (NH 4 OH) methods. Interestingly, replacement of the (+) -CSA- anion by either Cl- or (-) - CSA- did not significantly alter the CD spectrum of the films, indicating that the initial macroasymmetry of the polymer chains is maintained during these treatments. The optically active polyanilines PAn. (+) - or (-) -HCSA and PAn. (-) -HCSA were also generated chemically in solution by the enantioselective acid doping of neutral emeraldine base (EB) with either PAn. (+) - or (-) -HCSA in various solvents such as NMP, DMSO, DMF and CHCI 3. Dark green films of these optically active polyaniline have also been obtained by casting onto glass from the above acid doped solutions in various solvents. Related optically active polytoluidines were similarly chemically synthesised in solution via the acid doping of neutral polytoluidine with either (+) - or (-) - camphorsulfonic in the solvents such as DMSO, and DMF. In all cases mirror-image circular dichroism spectra were obtained when the (+) - or (-) - CSA- anions were incorporated. These chiral conducting polyanilines were then studied as modified electrodes on glassy carbon. Compounds such as K 3 [Fe(CN) 6], 2, 6 - anthraquinone disulfonic acid disodium salt were found to undergo normal redox behaviour on these modified electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry studies also showed that <b>citraconic</b> <b>acid</b> could be reduced on these electrodes. However, attempts to achieve the asymmetric reduction of this prochiral substrate via electrolysis were unsuccessful, presumably due to the high resistance of the polyaniline at the potential required for the reduction. However, the electrochemical oxidation of methyl-p-tolyl sulfide to the corresponding sulfoxide could be carried out via electrolysis at this chiral modified electrode, giving a small degree chiral induction. Chiral polypyrroles have been similarly synthesised by incorporating (+) - camphorsulfonate or (+) - bromo-camphorsulfonate as the chiral counterions. The electrochemical behaviour, as well as morphology and tensile strength of the PPy. (+) - CSA- obtained was examined, as well as their use as chiral modified electrodes for the electrochemical reduction and electrolysis of some simple compounds such as K 3 [Fe(CN) 6], 2, 6 - anthraquinone disulfonic acid disodium salt and <b>citraconic</b> <b>acid.</b> Finally, the ability of chiral membranes made by depositing PAn. (+) -HCSA on either polysulfone or polyvinilidine flouride to discriminate between the enantiomeric forms CSA- has been explored. These membranes were found to transport (+) -CSA- considerably more readily than (-) -CSA-, suggesting that they have potential for the separation of the enantiomeric forms of chiral anions...|$|E
