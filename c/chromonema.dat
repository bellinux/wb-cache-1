XPERIMENTAL analysis of diploid chromosome architecture has focused predominantly on mitotic rather than interphase chromosome structure. However, a serious limitation in studying mitotic chromosome structure is their tremendous packing density and folding complexity. As discussed previously (Belmont et al., 1987), most investigators have dealt with this complexity either by focusing on surface topology or by using procedures aimed at unfolding the chromosome. Depending on the experimental approach, different observed features have been emphasized leading to several different and mutually exclusive models of mitotic chromosome structure. These models include successive helical folding (Sedat and Manuelidis...|$|E
40|$|Periodicity in the {{distribution}} of prominent bands was analysed from the light and electron microscopic maps of salivary gland chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster. The data obtained indicate that a similar distribution of prominent chromomeres in an individual interphase chromatid results in a unilateral accumulation of chromatin at the <b>chromonema</b> stage, if the helical axis of <b>chromonema</b> consists of ~S- 9 interchromomere + chromomere units per turn. Orientation of the largest chromomeres mainly on one lateral half and the smallest chromomeres mairrly on the opposite lateral half of the <b>chromonema</b> apparently bends it to form the chromosomal 'macro * coil. Thus the increase in DNA content in the chromomeric loops located at specific intervals along the chromatids may have {{an important role in the}} evolution of coiling hierarchy in the eukaryotic chromosomes...|$|E
40|$|Chromosome {{structure}} and mitosis {{have been examined}} in three evolutionarily diverse members of the Pyrrophyta. Chromosome uncoiling, revealing the <b>chromonema,</b> has been correlated with the uptake of [3 H]thymidine. In addition, chromosome uncoiling has been observed during gamete formation, gamete fusion, and in the nucleolar organizing region of the chromosomes suggesting that dinoflagellate chromosomes undergoing duplication, transcription or pairing have a morphology different from the characteristic tightly banded structure generally observed during most of interphase and mitosis. The dinoflagellate <b>chromonema</b> is composed of 2. 5 -nm fibers and 9. 0 -nm granules coiled into a helix around a central core of 9. 0 -nm fibers. Chromosome attachment to nuclear channels and kinetochore division and separation have been examined in several dinoflagellates. After evaluating many nuclear and cytoplasmic characteristics of the dinoflagellates it appears that this group of organisms are true eukaryotes which {{may be on the}} main line to the evolution of the mitotic spindle typical of higher plant and animals cells. ...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of {{tertiary}} chromatin {{structure in}} mammalian interphase chromosomes is largely derived from artificial tandem arrays. In these model systems, light microscope images reveal fibers or beaded fibers after high-density targeting of transactivators to insertional domains spanning several megabases. These images of fibers have lent support to <b>chromonema</b> fiber models of tertiary structure. To assess {{the relevance of}} these studies to natural mammalian chromatin, we identified two different ∼ 400 -kb regions on human chromosomes 6 and 22 and then examined light microscope images of interphase tertiary chromatin structure when the regions were transcriptionally active and inactive. When transcriptionally active, these natural chromosomal regions elongated, yielding images characterized {{by a series of}} adjacent puncta or “beads”, referred to hereafter as beaded images. These elongated structures required transcription for their maintenance. Thus, despite marked differences in the density and the mode of transactivation, the natural and artificial systems showed similarities, suggesting that beaded images are generic features of transcriptionally active tertiary chromatin. We show here, however, that these images do not necessarily favor <b>chromonema</b> fiber models but can also be explained by a radial-loop model or even a simple nucleosome affinity, random-chain model. Thus, light microscope images of tertiary structure cannot distinguish among competing models, although they do impose key constraints: chromatin must be clustered to yield beaded images and then packaged within each cluster to enable decondensation into adjacent clusters...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Analysis of the {{relationship}} between transcriptional activators and chromatin organization has focused largely on lower levels of chromatin structure. Here we describe striking remodeling of large-scale chromatin structure induced by a strong transcriptional activator. A VP 16 -lac repressor fusion protein targeted the VP 16 acidic activation domain to chromosome regions containing lac operator repeats. Targeting was accompanied by increased transcription, localized histone hyperacetylation, and recruitment of at least three different histone acetyltransferases. Observed effects on large-scale chromatin structure included unfolding of a 90 -Mbp heterochromatic chromosome arm into an extended 25 – 40 -�m <b>chromonema</b> fiber, remodeling of this fiber into a novel subnuclear domain, and propagatio...|$|E
40|$|<b>Chromonema</b> heliothidis n. gen., n. sp. is {{described}} as an entomophilic nematode of Heliothis zea and other lepidopterous larvae; the diagnosis of the family Steinernermatidae is emended. In most morphological and host-parasite features, this nematode is similar to neoaplectanid nematodes; however, males are different in having a peloderan bursa and straight to slightly curved spicules. Although the infective-stage juveniles only give rise to hermaphrodites, the nematode is heterogonic, with {{both males and females}} being produced in the second generation. Parasitized hosts are brick-red in color and luminescent in the dark because of the association of a chromogenic, bioluminescent bacterium with the nematode. The nematode is capable of parasitizing a wide range of insects with lepidopterous larvae being most susceptible...|$|E
40|$|There are 19 telomitic rodshaped {{chromosomes}} inAularches. The spermatogonial {{cells and}} the behaviour of the chromosomes in them {{are similar in}} general to the same processes in other grasshoppers. There is strong evidence for the <b>chromonema</b> theory {{of the structure of}} chromosomes. The chromonemata are double in the telophases and become very thin and reach the limit of visibility during the resting stage. This supports the observations of Robertson, McClung and others on the telophase splits in grasshoppers. The chromosome vesicles are formed in the interphase due to the limited centrifugal movement of the chromosome matrices. The chromonemata exhibit a spiral structure in the prophase. The earliest prophase stages show the chromonemata to be double. The chromonemata gradually thicken and uncoil leading to the late prophase chromosomes. ...|$|E
40|$|Eukaryotic genomes are {{organized}} into condensed, heterogeneous chromatin fibers {{throughout much of}} the cell cycle. Here we describe recent studies indicating that even transcriptionally active loci may be encompassed within 80 - to 100 -nanometer-thick <b>chromonema</b> fibers. These studies suggest that chromatin higher order folding may be a key feature of eukaryotic transcriptional control. We also discuss evidence suggesting that adenosine- 5 -triphosphate–dependent chromatin-remodeling en-zymes and histone-modifying enzymes may regulate transcription by controlling the extent and dynamics of chromatin higher order folding. Compaction of eukaryotic genomesinto condensed chromatin fibers isrequired to fit over a meter of DNA within the limited volume of the nucleus; consequently, this compacted structure is inherently repressive to processes that re-quire access to the DNA sequence. The role of higher order chromatin folding in tran-scriptional control received the lion’s shar...|$|E
40|$|We use Monte Carlo {{simulations}} {{to study}} attractive and excluded volume interactions between nucleosome core particles in 30 nm-chromatin fibers. The nucleosomes {{are treated as}} disk-like objects having an excluded volume and short range attraction modelled by {{a variant of the}} Gay-Berne potential. The nucleosomes are connected via bendable and twistable linker DNA in the crossed linker fashion. We investigate the influence of the nucleosomal excluded volume on the stiffness of the fiber. For parameter values that correspond to chicken erythrocyte chromatin we find that the persistence length is governed to a large extent by that excluded volume whereas the soft linker backbone elasticity plays only a minor role. We further find that internucleosomal attraction can induce the formation of hairpin configurations. Tension-induced opening of such configurations into straight fibers manifests itself in a quasi-plateau in the force-extension curve that resembles results from recent micromanipulation experiments. Such hairpins {{may play a role in}} the formation of higher order structures in chromosomes like <b>chromonema</b> fibers. Comment: 11 pages, 5 figures, Phys. Rev. E, in pres...|$|E

These changes in large-scale chromatin structure occurred even with inhibition of ongoing transcription by α-amanitin. Our results suggest a functional link between recruitment of the transcriptional machinery and changes in large-scale chromatin structure. Based on the observed long-range propagation of changes in large-scale chromatin structure, we suggest a possible rationale for the observed clustering of housekeeping genes within Mbp-sized chromosome bands...|$|E
40|$|The {{internal}} structure of an aerobic spore-forming bacterium, Bacillus aneurinolyticus {{has been studied}} by means of ultramicrotomy accompanied with electron microscopy. A fine reticular structure which suggested the <b>chromonema</b> net-works in {{the nucleus of the}} higher organism was observed within the nuclei of cells in a certain stage of development, and an attempt to reveal its behavior during cellular division and the process of sporulation has been made. In the dividing vegetative cells, the reticulum was observed to be made up of rod-like structures, however, its interpretation as being chromosomes had not been ventured. A portion of the reticular structure (nuclear material) of the vegetative cell has been assumed to share a most important role in forming an endospore, the nucleus of which was observed to bear a more granular structure. The {{internal structure}} of the developing endospore, turned into a characteristic profile of the spore as it matured. The survival of the reticular structure was also discernible among the disintegrating cellular elements of the sporulating cells. A nucleolus-like osmiophilic granule and a considerable number of cytoplasmic granules which were identified as the oxidative-reductive sites of the cells, were observed...|$|E
