40|$|Abstract. An {{evolutionary}} scenario {{to explain}} the transient nature and short total duration of the X-ray burst of SAX J 1808. 4 – 3658 is proposed. An optical companion of the neutron star(a“turn-off ” Main-Sequence star) fills its Roche lobe at the orbital period (P orb) ∼ 19 hours. During the initial high masstransfer phase when the neutron star is a persistent X-ray source, the neutron star is spun up to a millisecond period. Due to its chemical composition gradient, the secondary does not become fully convective when its mass decreases below 0. 3 M⊙, hence a magnetic braking remains an effective mechanism to remove orbital angular momentum and the system evolves with Rochelobe overflow towards a short orbital period. Near an orbital period of two hours the mass transfer rate becomes so small (∼ 10 − 11 M⊙/yr) that the system <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> be observed as a persistent X-ray source.

40|$|Postmodernism and neo-liberalism {{is often}} thought of as two {{opposite}} conceptions of the reality and the world. This thesis takes on a critical view of this assertion and the main purpose was to perform a correlation between postmodernism and neo-liberalism. With different theoretical assumptions about constructions of thoughts, agency and structure and the welfare-state a theoretical framework was created. According to this framework the two isms were correlated {{to each other and}} the welfare-state to see if there where similarities or dissimilarities between the isms. The assumptions of this thesis are that there are correlations between postmodernism and neo-liberalism in the constructions of thoughts, namely similar view on epistemology. The two isms also show similarity between each other towards the foundations upon which the modern welfare-state rests. This is mainly manifested in their common view of the institutions of the welfare-state, which the isms both finds problematic. This results in a mutual problematic view on positive freedom, the foundation of legitimacy, the means and economic democracy as they are manifested in a given welfare-state. However, the motive for criticism rests mostly on different justifications for the two isms. Anyhow, their views share doubts about the legitimacy of the welfare-state in common. This even though postmodernism is partly a result of the welfare-politics.

40|$|Aerospace {{technology}} {{plays an}} important role in the modern scientific research and engineering applications. Most energy consumed by equipment inside the spacecraft is converted into waste heat. Current thermal control and management technology research for international aerospace has made considerable progress. Vapor compression heat pump is an important aerospace thermal control means to lunar probe program and deep space exploration. Compressors are the most important components in vapor compression heat pump systems. How to improve the performance of aerospace refrigeration compressors is a key technology. Micro-gravity environment has a great impact on system performance. For the study of the performance of compressor and heat pump system under micro-gravity environment, a test bed for the gravity independence of space-borne vapor compression heat pump system is designed and built. The test system of gravity independence mainly consists of three parts: refrigerant cycle system, water cycle system and data acquisition system. The paper tests the gravity independence of rotary compressor performance, and evaluates the performance of compressor and heat pump system in micro-gravity environment. The results show that when the control voltage of compressor speed is 2 V, the maximum tilt angle is about 60 ° under the condition of low speed operation. The inclination angle of compressor has little effect on evaporation and condensation pressure. Evaporation and condensation pressure is 4. 3 bar and 12 bar, respectively, and the pressure ratio is steady. Energy efficiency ratio and coefficient of performance are about 3. 3 and 4. 2, respectively. Under the condition of the maximum tilt angle of 60 °, the system could run in the compressor speed control range of 1 - 3. 5 V. There’s a balance point when the control voltage is 1 - 2 V, and the maximum of energy efficiency ratio and coefficient of performance are 3. 1 and 4. 0, respectively. When the voltage is 2. 5 - 3. 5 V, the compressor suction and exhaust temperature is difficult to stabilize, showing a periodical rise and fall. If the voltage is more than 3. 5 V, the compressor stops to run for self-protection. Under the condition that the compressor works in full, the maximum tilt angle is 20 °. When the tilt angle is less than 20 °, the compressor is under normal operation; when the tilt angle is more than 20 °, the compressor <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> maintain the operation, resulting in downtime. When the tilt angel is less than 20 °, the performance parameters do not change with the increase of the inclination angle. Evaporation and condensation pressure stabilize at 4. 2 and 13 bar, respectively. Energy efficiency ratio and coefficient of performance are about 2. 7 and 3. 6, respectively. Under the condition of the tilt angle of 15 °, as the control voltage increases from 1. 5 to 5 V, the energy efficiency ratio decreases from 3. 5 to 2. 7, and the coefficient of performance drops from 4. 2 to 3. 6...|$|E
40|$|Launch {{vehicles}} {{and most of}} their payloads spend {{the majority of their}} time on the ground. The cost of ground operations is very high. So, why so often is so little attention given to ground processing during development? The current global space industry and economic environment are driving more need for efficiencies to save time and money. Affordability and sustainability are more important now than ever. We <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> treat space vehicles as mere science projects. More RLV's (Reusable Launch Vehicles) are being developed for the gains of reusability which are not available for ELV's (Expendable Launch Vehicles). More human-rated vehicles are being developed, with the retirement of the Space Shuttles, and for a new global space race, yet these cost more than the many unmanned vehicles of today. We can learn many lessons on affordability from RLV's. DFO (Design for Operations) considers ground operations during design, development, and manufacturing-before the first flight. This is often minimized for space vehicles, but is very important. Vehicles are designed for launch and mission operations. You {{will not be able to}} do it again if it is too slow or costly to get there. Many times, technology changes faster than space products such that what is launched includes outdated features, thus reducing competitiveness. Ground operations must be considered for the full product Lifecycle, from concept to retirement. Once manufactured, launch vehicles along with their payloads and launch systems require a long path of processing before launch. Initial assembly and testing always discover problems to address. A solid integration program is essential to minimize these impacts, as was seen in the Constellation Ares I-X test rocket. For RLV's, landing/recovery and post-flight turnaround activities are performed. Multi-use vehicles require reconfiguration. MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) must be well-planned [...] - even for the unplanned problems. Defect limits and standard repairs need to be in-place as well as easily added. Many routine inspections and maintenance can be like an aircraft overhaul. Modifications and technology upgrades should be expected. Another factor affecting ground operations efficiency is trending. It is essential for RLV's, and also useful for ELV's which fly the same or similar models again. Good data analysis of technical and processing performance will determine fixes and improvements needed for safety, design, and future processing. Collecting such data on new or low-frequency vehicles is a challenge. Lessons can be learned from the Space Shuttle, or even the Concorde aircraft. For all of the above topics, efficient business systems must be established for comprehensive program management and good throughput. Drawings, specifications, and manuals for an entire launch vehicle are often in different formats from multiple vendors, plus they have proprietary constraints. Nonetheless, the integration team must ensure that all data needed is compatible and visible to each appropriate team member. Ground processing systems for scheduling, tracking, problem resolution, etc. must be well laid-out. The balance between COTS (commercial off the shelf) and custom software is difficult. Multiple customers, vendors, launch sites, and landing sites add to the complexity of efficient IT (Information Technology) tools...|$|E
30|$|During the middle–late {{stages of}} steam {{injection}} processes, steam channeling and steam override occur {{and become more}} and more serious, resulting in poor development effect of CSS and SF. It mainly results in decreased daily oil production, increased water cut, and low cumulative oil–steam ratio (OSR). In general, the average oil recovery of CSS after eight cycles is about 20 % and that of SF is 40 – 50 %. That suggests the heavy oil reservoirs have huge developing potential after steam injection. Hot-water flooding is considered as an effective EOR technique for heavy oil after steam injection (8, Diaz-Munoz and Farouq Ali 1975; Fournier 1965; Harmsen 1971; Tagavifar et al. 2016; Zhao and Gates 2013; Luo and Torabi 2013). It <b>can</b> <b>not</b> only <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> heat the reservoir, but also make use of the residual heat of steam. Compared with other thermal recovery methods, the sweep area in the hot-water flooding process mainly locates {{in the bottom of the}} reservoir, in spite of the permeability of the upper layer being higher than that of the bottom. The EOR mechanisms of hot-water flooding include (1) heating and viscosity reduction—heavy oil viscosity reduces dramatically with the increase of temperature, which decreases viscosity fingering and then improves areal sweep efficiency. (2) Pressure maintenance—similar to conventional water flooding, hot-water flooding can maintain reservoir pressure and supplement displacement energy. (3) Mobility ratio reduction—as oil viscosity is decreased, the mobility ratio between oil and water also decreases so much that oil-flow ability increases. (4) Sweep efficiency improvement—the injected steam usually flows to the upper layer of the reservoir preferentially due to its lower density, while the injected hot-water can carry the retained heat of steam to the bottom region under the action of gravity because of its higher density, thus improving the vertical sweep efficiency of the reservoir. (5) The thermal expansion of rock and fluid—the injection of hot-water causes thermal expansion of rock and fluid in the reservoir, which is beneficial for formation pressure recovery. But for reservoir that is flooded by hot-water after steam injection, this effect is not very obvious. As thermal expansion of rock and fluid is much stronger. (6) Relative permeability and wettability alteration—as water temperature rises, polar substances such as asphaltene and colloid are not absorbed on the rock. The rock surface tends to be hydrophilic and the residual oil saturation declines.|$|R
