40|$|Motivated by the Nekrasov-Okounkov formula on hook lengths, {{the first}} author conjectured that the Plancherel average of the 2 k-th power sum of hook lengths of {{partitions}} with size n is always a polynomial of n for any k∈N. This conjecture was generalized and proved by Stanley (Ramanujan J., 23 (1 [...] 3) : 91 [...] 105, 2010). In this paper, inspired {{by the work of}} Stanley and Olshanski on the differential poset of Young lattice, we study the properties of two kinds of difference operators D and D^- defined on functions of partitions. Even though the calculations for higher orders of D are extremely complex, we prove that several well-known families of functions of partitions are annihilated by a power of the difference operator D. As an application, our results lead to several generalizations of classic results on partitions, including the marked hook formula, Stanley Theorem, Okada-Panova hook length <b>formula,</b> and Fujii-Kanno-Moriyama-Okada <b>content</b> <b>formula.</b> We insist that the Okada constants K_r arise directly from the computation for a single partition λ, without the summation ranging over all partitions of size n.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we prove the Hook <b>Content</b> <b>Formula</b> (HCF) (and Hook Length Formula (HLF)) using induction. Instead {{of working with}} Young tableaux directly, we {{introduce}} a vector notation (sequences of these vectors represent ("single-vote") ballot sequences {{in the case of}} SYT, and "multi-vote" ballot sequences [...] where the voter may choose any number of candidates [...] in the case of SSYT) to aid in the inductive argument. Next, we establish an identity which allows us to prove a formula that counts multi-vote ballot sequences. We demonstrate that, in the non-degenerate case (when this formula counts SSYTs) it coincides with the HCF. To do the latter, we borrow parts of a technique outlined by Wilson and Van Lint in their proof of the HLF. We then establish an identity, which is really a special case of the equation mentioned above, and show that the HLF follows from it. (Wilson and Van Lint prove this identity directly, and use it to prove the HLF in a similar manner.) We then note the appearance of an expression resembling the Weyl dimension formula and conclude with a combinatorial result. Comment: 12 page...|$|R

Methods: Secondary data analysis from a randomized clinical trial where healthy term infants were randomized after birth to a higher (HP) or lower (LP) protein <b>content</b> <b>formula</b> that was consumed until age 1 year. A non-randomized group of breastfed (BF) infants was used for reference. Anthropometry, dietary intakes and calciuria (calcium/creatinine ratios) from spot urine samples were assessed at ages 3 and 6 months. At 6 months, the kidney volumes were assessed using ultrasonography, and the serum urea and creatinine levels were determined. Results: BF infants showed the highest calciuria levels, followed by the HP and the LP groups (p < 0. 001 for all comparisons). Either protein intakes or formula types modulated the calciuria in linear regression models adjusted for other influencing dietary factors. The usual cut-off values classified 37. 8 % (BF), 16. 8 % (HP) and 4. 9 % (LP) of the infants as hypercalciuric. Conclusions: Feeding types during {{the first months of}} life affect calciuria, with BF infants presenting the highest levels.

40|$|Obesity usually {{results from}} a {{combination}} of several modifiable and non-modifiable contributing factors, such as genetics, race, and socioeconomic status. Other factors, including birth by cesarean section, perinatal antibiotics usage, and promotion of exclusive breastfeeding for six months, could be potentially prevented or modulated. However, one of the factors can be easily implemented through reduction of protein <b>content</b> in infant <b>formulas</b> for non-breastfed infants. High protein (HP) in infant formula is one of the causes of rapid weight gain, predisposing the neonates to later obesity. This study was performed to evaluate the effect of HP formula on weight gain and resulting risks of later obesity. The samples (i. e., non-breastfed infants) were randomly divided into two groups of HP formula (2. 9 and 4. 4 g protein/ 100 kcal before and after five months of age, respectively) and LP formula (1. 77 and 2. 2 g protein/ 100 kcal before and after five months of age, respectively) in this study. At the age of two, weight-for-length z-score of the infants in the HP formula group was calculated at 0. 20 (95 %CI: 0. 06, 0. 34), which was higher compared to the LP group. Meanwhile, the latter group had results similar to the findings of the control group (breastfed). Body length of the infants was not affected by the extent of protein intake. A six-year follow-up of the subjects indicated a significantly lower body mass index (BMI) (0. 51) in the LP formula group (95 % CI: 0. 13, 0. 90; P= 0. 009). In addition, a 2. 43 fold risk of later obesity (95 % CI: 1. 12, 5. 27; P= 0. 024) was reported in the LP group, which was lower compared to the HP formula group. Given the role of HP formula as one of the contributing factors in the development of metabolic syndrome and obesity risks in infants, it is recommended that lower protein <b>content</b> <b>formulas</b> be used in non-breastfed neonates to prevent later obesity and other complications...|$|R

40|$|Steam {{explosion}} {{is one of}} {{the leading}} and most promising biorefinery technologies for lignocellulosic biomass. Water as the only transfer medium participated in steam explosion process is closely correlated with refining efficacy and energy consumption, while researches on steam explosion are neglected from transfer mechanism. In this work, from water transfer perspective, steam explosion process was innovatively divided into four specific stages and the multi-stage mass transfer model of steam explosion process was firstly established. From this model, quantitative relation of water composition in each stage and final water <b>content</b> <b>formula</b> were evaluated, which is efficient to guide the process energy efficiency with several proposed regulation strategies. By combining transfer process simulation with pretreatment efficacy evaluation, much water in feedstock presented a buffering effect on reaction and transfer issues during steam explosion process, thereby weakening the actual severity of treatment. 40 % water content of cellulosic biomass was optimized from the compromise between treatment efficacy and energy efficiency. The yield of overall glucose through pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis was increased by over 20 % with a potential cost savings of steam consumption by simply coordinating water content of cellulosic biomass prior to steam explosion treatment. Thus, results in the work emphasize the water transfer and regulation during steam explosion process on understanding water reaction mechanism, enhancing pretreatment efficacy and saving energy, leading to more efficient use of biomass.

40|$|Background: Nutritional factors {{during a}} {{sensitive}} period can influence child {{development in a}} sex-related manner. Objective: Our aim was to investigate whether sex modulates the responses of relevant biochemical parameters and growth to different protein intakes early in life. Design: In a randomized controlled trial, formula-fed infants were assigned to receive formula with higher protein (HP) or lower protein (LP) content. The main outcome measures were insulin-like growth factor (IGF) - 1 axis parameters, weight, length, BMI, leptin, and C-peptide/creatinine ratio at 6 mo of age. Dietary intake during the first 6 mo of life was also assessed. Results: The IGF- 1 axis response to HP feeding was modulated by sex. Total and free IGF- 1 and IGF binding protein 3 concentrations were higher in girls than in boys. Compared with the LP diet, the HP diet was associated with higher IGF- 1 and lower IGF binding protein 2 secretion. The response to this HP <b>content</b> <b>formula</b> tended to be stronger in girls than in boys. The HP diet {{was associated with a}} higher C-peptide/creatinine ratio. The leptin concentration was higher in girls than in boys and was correlated to the IGF- 1 axis parameters. No interaction between sex and nutritional intervention was shown on growth. Conclusions: Our findings show that the endocrine response to a high protein diet early in life may be modulated by sex. The IGF- 1 axis of female infants shows a stronger response to the nutritional intervention than does that of male infants, but there is no enhanced effect on growth.
