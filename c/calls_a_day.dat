5|$|After the {{manifesto}} was published, the FBI received over {{a thousand}} <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> for months {{in response to the}} offer of a $1million reward for information leading to the identity of the Unabomber. Many letters claiming to be from the Unabomber were also sent to the UNABOM Task Force, and thousands of suspect leads were reviewed. While the FBI was occupied with new leads, David Kaczynski hired private investigator Susan Swanson in Chicago to investigate Ted's activities discreetly. The Kaczynski brothers had become estranged in 1990, and David had not seen Ted for ten years. David later hired Washington, D.C., attorney Tony Bisceglie to organize evidence acquired by Swanson, and make contact with the FBI, given the likely difficulty in attracting the FBI's attention. He wanted to protect his brother from the danger of an FBI raid, such as the Ruby Ridge or the Waco Siege, since he assumed Ted would not take kindly to being contacted by the FBI and would be likely to react violently.|$|E

[...] The Chicago Tribune noted Schwa's initial menu did just that, {{featuring}} [...] "a soft-boiled organic egg coated in brioche, served with potato puree and Illinois sturgeon caviar". [...] Within weeks, the restaurant had garnered a strong buzz among local foodies. [...] National press attention quickly followed, including Carlson receiving [...] "Best New Chef" [...] honors from Food & Wine magazine, as Schwa {{earned a reputation}} for great food and an innovative chef-customer relationship. By early 2007, Schwa was receiving 100 <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> and had a three-month-long waiting list for reservations.|$|E

500|$|Describing {{the time}} spent {{promoting}} the album as [...] "some weird roller coaster ride", DJ Shadow was dismayed {{by the lack of}} reaction he received upon returning to his hometown of Davis, compared to the thriving attention he had received within the British music scene. He felt that he had been manipulated by the press and his record label and [...] "went from being angry to being depressed about the perceived lack of control [...] had in [...] life." [...] DJ Shadow found himself compelled to produce new tracks such as [...] "High Noon" [...] as a way of expressing his feelings at the time. It was following this period that an interest in DJ Shadow's work began to generate in the United States, with newspapers running stories on Endtroducing..... and DJ Shadow receiving several phone <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> enough to convince him to hire his own manager. The album later debuted on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart, where it eventually peaked at number 37. A deluxe edition of Endtroducing..... was released on June 7, 2005. The re-issue includes a second disc of B-sides, remixes, and demo material entitled Excessive Ephemera as well as liner notes by DJ Shadow discussing the album's making. A second deluxe edition commemorating the album's 20th anniversary, entitled Endtrospective, was released on October 28, 2016, featuring demo material, alternate takes, live versions, and a bonus remix album entitled Endtroducing... Re-Imagined, as well as additional photography and expanded liner notes.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, {{following}} Gary Speed's {{departure from}} the job as manager of Sheffield United for the position as the head coach of Wales, Adams {{was one of a}} handful of names linked to the vacant position at United. On Christmas Eve, Vale chairman Bill Bratt announced he had [...] "reluctantly" [...] given Adams permission to talk to Sheffield United. Six days later it was announced that he would be taking the position, and he announced his three aims as manager would be to firstly avoid relegation, to then challenge for promotion, and finally [...] "to develop a structure that will build us a reputation for home grown talent that fans can be proud of in their team". Former United player Alan Cork was installed as his assistant, Cork had worked as Adams' assistant at Fulham, Swansea, Leicester and Coventry. The fourth manager at the club that season, he brought in Dave Bassett in a consultancy role after finding managing the club a bigger task than he had previously assumed. As Adams explained: [...] "When you're manager at Port Vale you probably get three <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> and one of those is from the wife asking me what time I'm coming home for my tea." [...] His honeymoon period dissipated quickly, as United failed to win in his first eleven games in charge (four draws and seven defeats) and slipped into 23rd spot after letting slip a two-goal lead to lose 3–2 to fellow relegation strugglers Scunthorpe United. Adams told the press that [...] "The fans were singing 'you're not fit to wear the shirt', I cannot disagree with them. That is as disappointing a result as I have ever had in my career." [...] It took three months before he achieved his first win. The victory came on 8 March 2011 (his fourteenth game in charge), as his side came from behind to beat Nottingham Forest 2–1. Sheffield United were relegated to League One at the end of the season, finishing six points short of safety. Adams and United parted company after a meeting with owner Kevin McCabe. McCabe stated that he wished to initiate a [...] "clean sweep at the top and start afresh"; whilst Adams said that whilst he was [...] "very, very disappointed with the decision... I am a Blade and will always be a Blade." ...|$|E

A {{telegram}} fetched me home unexpectedly just as I was entering for my degree. I found my father seriously ill and almost broken-hearted. I stayed with him, and in a fortnight he died. There was just enough--barely enough--to pay what he owed, and nothing left of his small fortune. His brother, my uncle, came down to the funeral, and I regret to say that even then I quarreled with him. He made use of language concerning my father and his folly which I could not tolerate. My father was very simple and very credulous and very honorable. He was just the sort of man who becomes the prey of these wretched circular-mongering sharks. What he did, he did for my sake. My uncle spoke of him with contempt, spoke as though he were charged with the care of me through my father's foolishness. I am afraid I made no allowance for my uncle's peculiar temperament. The moment the funeral was over, I turned him out of the house. I have no other relatives. I came to London sooner than remain down in the country and be found a position out of charity, which is, I suppose, what would have happened. I took a room and looked for work. Naturally, I was glad to get anything. I used to make about forty <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> till I called at your husband's office in Tooley Street and got a situation." ...|$|E
