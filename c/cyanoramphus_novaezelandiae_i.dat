For the past decade, there have been increasing reports of feather loss in this species on the island.

50|$|The Norfolk parakeet (Cyanoramphus cookii), {{also called}} Tasman parakeet, Norfolk Island green parrot or Norfolk Island red-crowned parakeet, is {{a species of}} parrot in the family Psittaculidae. It is endemic to Norfolk Island (located between Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia in the Tasman Sea). The species was once {{considered}} a subspecies of the red-fronted parakeet of New Zealand. The name Tasman parakeet is used by Christidis and Boles on the argument that this species and the Lord Howe red-crowned parakeet (<b>Cyanoramphus</b> <b>novaezelandiae</b> subflavescens) are probably a single species for which they use biogeographical arguments. Tasman is used for other species with the same distribution and they propose that name for that reason. However, the latter subspecies {{was not included in}} the genus-wide phylogenetic reconstruction using DNA sequences, and the lumping of the species should be considered tentative.|$|R
40|$|Summary: The diet of red-crowned parakeets (<b>Cyanoramphus</b> <b>novaezelandiae</b> novaezelandiae) and yellowcrowned parakeets (C. auriceps auriceps) was {{compared}} on Little Barrier Island, New Zealand between 1986 and 1987. Significant dietary differences {{were observed in}} these sympatric, congeneric species. Yellowcrowned parakeets ate significantly more invertebrates than red-crowned parakeets, which fed on {{a greater variety of}} plant foods. Red-crowned parakeets were found in all vegetation types depending on the availability of food and were commonly seen foraging on the ground in open habitats. In contrast, yellowcrowned parakeets were more arboreal and showed distinct preferences for forested habitats. The existence of both parakeet species in sympatry is examined as is the ecological importance of invertebrate food sources. Observed differences in the behaviour and ecology of parakeet species on Little Barrier Island are used to provide insight into the present day distribution and status of parakeets on mainland New Zealand. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R
25|$|Raoul {{is part of}} the Kermadec Islands {{subtropical}} moist forests ecoregion and {{is largely}} covered with closed-canopy forest, predominantly of the evergreen Kermadec pōhutukawa (Metrosideros kermadecensis) and the Kermadec nikau palm (Rhopalostylis baueri, formerly described as Rhopalostylis cheesemanii). It is just far enough south that the occasional fertile coconut from Polynesia that washes up on shore and takes root will not survive in the longterm {{due to a lack of}} warmth. The island has no native land mammals and was formerly home to vast colonies of seabirds who nested in the forests. The islands may once have had a species of megapode (based on early settler records) and a subspecies of kereru. Currently native landbirds on the island include the Kermadec red-crowned parakeet (<b>Cyanoramphus</b> <b>novaezelandiae</b> cyanurus), the Australasian harrier, pukeko, tui and several introduced species. The island forms part of the Kermadec Islands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it is an important site for nesting seabirds.|$|R
40|$|Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD) is a {{viral disease}} {{distributed}} worldwide with a potentially critical impact on many rare parrots. While {{efforts have been}} made to determine its prevalence in wild and captive psittacines, only limited work has been done to document complete genomes of its causative agent, beak and feather disease virus (BFDV). Here, we describe five full genomes of BFDV isolated from wild specimens of an endemic New Zealand parrot, the red-fronted parakeet (<b>Cyanoramphus</b> <b>novaezelandiae).</b> The isolates share [99 % nucleotide similarity amongst themselves and * 91 – 92 % similarity to BFDV isolates from southern Africa, Europe and Australia. A maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree including 42 other full-genome sequences indicated that the five isolates from red-fronted parakeets represent an undescribed genotype of BFDV. These isolates are evolutionarily most closely related to the Cacatuini isolates from Thailand and the Lorinae isolates from Australia in the rep gene ML tree; however, in the cp ML tree, the evolutionary relationship is closer to viruses found in the Psittacini...|$|R
40|$|Feathers {{are known}} to contain amplifiable DNA at their base (calamus) and have {{provided}} an important genetic source from museum specimens. However, feathers in subfossil deposits generally only preserve the upper shaft and feather ‘vane’ which {{are thought to be}} unsuitable for DNA analysis. We analyse subfossil moa feathers from Holocene New Zealand rockshelter sites and demonstrate that both ancient DNA and plumage information can be recovered from their upper portion, allowing species identification and a means to reconstruct the appearance of extinct taxa. These ancient DNA sequences indicate that the distal portions of feathers are an untapped resource for studies of museum, palaeontological and modern specimens. We investigate the potential to reconstruct the plumage of pre-historically extinct avian taxa using subfossil remains, rather than assuming morphological uniformity with closely related extant taxa. To test the notion of colour persistence in subfossil feathers, we perform digital comparisons of feathers of the red-crowned parakeet (<b>Cyanoramphus</b> <b>novaezelandiae</b> novaezelandiae) excavated from the same horizons as the moa feathers, with modern samples. The results suggest that the coloration of the moa feathers is authentic, and computer software is used to perform plumage reconstructions of moa based on subfossil remains...|$|R
40|$|Pathogen {{outbreaks}} in {{the wild}} can contribute to a population’s extinction risk. Concern over the effects of pathogen outbreaks in wildlife is amplified in small, threatened populations, where degradation of genetic diversity may hinder natural selection for enhanced immunocompetence. Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) was detected {{for the first time}} in an island population of red-crowned parakeets (<b>Cyanoramphus</b> <b>novaezelandiae)</b> in 2008 on Little Barrier Island (Hauturu-o-Toi) of New Zealand. By 2013, the prevalence of the viral infection had significantly decreased within the population. We tested whether the population of red-crowned parakeets showed a selective response to BFDV, using neutral microsatellite and two immunity-associated genetic markers, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We found evidence for selection at viral-associated TLR 3; however, the ability of TLR 3 to elicit an immune response in the presence of BFDV warrants confirmation. Alternatively, because red-crowned parakeet populations are prone to fluctuations in size, the decrease in BFDV prevalence over time may be attributed to the Little Barrier Island population dropping below the density threshold for viral maintenance. Our results highlight that natural processes such as adaptation for enhanced immunocompetence and/or density fluctuations are efficient mechanisms for reducing pathogen prevalence in a threatened, isolated population...|$|R
40|$|During a {{study on}} health and disease in Red-crowned Parakeets (<b>Cyanoramphus</b> <b>novaezelandiae)</b> on Tiritiri Matangi Island and Little Barrier Island (Hauturu-o-Toi) in New Zealand between 2011 and 2013, an {{outbreak}} of feather loss prompted the collection of skin biopsies (n 5135) under anesthesia {{from the head of}} captured birds. A subset of samples (n 57) was frozen to obtain whole specimens for identification of ectoparasites. Mites (range 1 – 11) were observed in 79 / 135 (58. 5 %) skin biopsies, whereas feather loss was only found in 47 / 142 (33. 1 %) birds captured during the sampling period. Compact orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis and acanthosis were found in association with mites. Procnemidocoptes janssensi (Acari: Epidermoptidae, Knemidokoptinae) was identified from whole mites obtained from skin biopsies. We describe the presence, pathology, and stages of infestation for knemidokoptinid mange in a wild parrot population in New Zealand. Given the clinical and pathologic changes observed and poor knowledge of the parasite’s New Zealand host and geographic distribution, further work is recommended for this and sympatric parrots, to understand relationships between the host, parasite, environment, and expression of disease. Results from this study reinforce the value of including biopsy samples for the investigation of skin disease in wild birds, particularly to link etiologic agents with pathologic changes...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Non-toxic {{plain and}} cinnamon-flavoured carrots and cereal-based baits used in {{poisoning}} operations {{for control of}} the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) were offered to seven species of captive rare birds at Mt Bruce National Wildlife Centre. Some individuals of all species ate plain baits. Antipodes Island parakeets (Cyanoramphus unicolor) preferred carrot to cereal-based baits, North Island kokako (Callaeas cinerea wilsoni) and North Island saddlebacks (Philesturnus carunculatus rufusater) preferred cereal-based baits to carrots, but the other species showed no bait preference. Most baits eaten were greater than 2 g. Some individuals of all species also ate cinnamon-flavoured baits. However, cinnamon deterred North Island kaka (Nestor meriodionalis septentrionalis), Antipodes Island parakeets, and kokako from feeding on baits the first day offered, though not subsequently. Insufficient baits were eaten by North Island weka (Gallirallus australis greyi), red-crowned parakeets (<b>Cyanoramphus</b> <b>novaezelandiae</b> novaezelandiae), and Reischek's parakeets (Cyanoramphus n. hochstetteri) to determine whether they were also deterred by cinnamon. Only saddlebacks were definitely not deterred. All species except red-crowned and Reischek's parakeets probably ate sufficient to receive a lethal dose if the baits had been toxic. Baits may be made less acceptable to birds by increasing the strength or slowing the release of cinnamon, or by using a more repellent flavour. Because baits may always be acceptable to some birds, wildlife managers need to know the chances of wild rare birds feeding on baits before approving poisoning operations in areas where they occur...|$|R
40|$|Research {{into the}} {{diseases}} of free–ranging wildlife requires targeted surveillance for pathogen(s) of interest, however also relies on reference data of general health indicators against which findings can be interpreted. Wildlife reintroductions and translocations in New Zealand introduce specific disease risks related to spread of disease agents {{from the source}} site, exposure to novel disease at the destination, or changes in transmission factors for existing diseases at the destination. The discovery of Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) causing clinical disease in wild Red-crowned Parakeets (RCP, <b>Cyanoramphus</b> <b>novaezelandiae)</b> intended for translocation in 2008 led to an increased interest from conservation managers in the pathogens affecting this species. This study aimed to investigate health and disease in a free-ranging population of RCP experiencing feather loss, with an epidemiological focus to determine temporal trends in disease prevalence, and infer risk factors for disease expression. We captured 229 individuals over 5 sampling sessions between 2011 - 2013, including 4 surveys on Tiritiri Matangi Island (n= 184), and one survey on Hauturu-o-Toi/Little Barrier Island (LBI) (n= 45). Normal haematological and biochemical reference ranges were described. The relatively high creatine kinase results highlighted a potential susceptibility to capture myopathy in this species, and warrant further investigation. Comparison of DNA-based sexing results to beak measurements demonstrated high concordance between the two sexing methods. We investigated BFDV in the population by PCR of blood and feather, and found a low total prevalence on Tiritiri Matangi Island of 1. 09...|$|R
40|$|With human impacts like habitat {{destruction}} {{and climate change}} contributing to range contractions in species, translocations stand out as an important tool for conserving species suffering from these effects. However, {{an understanding of the}} life history of many threatened species prior to translocation is often lacking, but critical for translocation success. For example, dispersal away from the release site—particularly when a protected release site is surrounded by unmanaged habitat—can result in translocation failure, and therefore successful translocation practice must include an understanding of a species’ dispersal patterns. I conducted a study examining the breeding biology and post-fledging dispersal of a population of red-crowned parakeets <b>Cyanoramphus</b> <b>novaezelandiae),</b> or kakariki, recently translocated to a mainland sanctuary in Wellington, New Zealand. The sanctuary, ZEALANDIA, is fenced to exclude invasive mammalian predators; however, birds can and do leave. Approximately one-third of juveniles that dispersed outside the sanctuary were killed by predators. Kakariki post-fledging dispersal was male-biased, possibly driven by inbreeding avoidance, and distance dispersed decreased with increasing body condition. Parental age may have also influenced offspring dispersal. In addition, I found that kakariki reproductive success may be affected by age, and estimated lifetime reproductive success was > 30 fledglings by age five. Conservation initiatives could work on controlling predators in currently unprotected reserves and around food sources that kakariki targeted, particularly in summer and autumn when many plants are fruiting and recently fledged juveniles are more active. Future translocations should consider selecting younger birds to translocate to take advantage of their high lifetime reproductive success and therefore improve viability of populations...|$|R
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{ecology of}} a translocated population of red-crowned kakariki (<b>Cyanoramphus</b> <b>novaezelandiae)</b> was monitored during 2004 - 2006, covering two breeding seasons on Tiritiri Matangi Island. Red-crowned kakariki nested in tree cavities, ground burrows and in vegetation clusters located in forest remnants, grasslands and replanted vegetation {{as well as}} in nestboxes. There was a marked difference in reproductive success between the two breeding seasons. In 2004 - 2005 1. 4 fledglings per breeding pair were produced. In contrast. 3. 4 fledglings per breeding pair were produced in 2005 - 2006. This increase was the result of changes in loss rate during the nesting cycle. Nest failure occurred in 57 % of nests in 2004 - 2005 whereas only 8 % of nests were affected in 2005 - 2006. In both breeding seasons, incubation was the main stage of losses. Clutches hatched with various degrees of asynchrony. Brood sizes ranged from one to nine nestlings. Within broods, nestlings of different hatching ranks reached similar mass at fledgling. Likewise, nestlings of different hatching ranks gained similar weight over the linear portion of the growth curve and grew wings at a similar rate. However, last hatched nestlings fledged with shorter wings. Furthermore, mortality was higher for last hatched nestlings. Sex ratios at the clutch level and at fledgling did not deviate from parity. However, at the clutch level there was a higher proportion of males in clutches laid early and middle in the breeding season. Various lines of evidence suggest that food availability has a direct effect on reproductive success of red-crowned kakariki and can exacerbate the costs of asynchronous hatching. Therefore it is a priority to investigate natural changes in food resources of the red-crowned kakariki and to assess the potential of direct management to improve the conservation of the species...|$|R

40|$|Introduced {{mammalian}} {{predators and}} anthropogenic habitat modification {{have resulted in}} the loss of 62 avian species since humans arrived in New Zealand. The conservation paradigm for New Zealand relies upon predator free, ecologically intact or restored islands to serve as sanctuaries and breeding sites for a range of threatened species. Island breeding programs and translocations to restore native fauna to the mainland and other off-shore sites, introduce specific risks related to disease spread. Beak and Feather Disease Vims (BFDV), was found in clinically affected juvenile Red Crowned Parakeet (RCP, <b>Cyanoramphus</b> <b>novaezelandiae)</b> on Hautum Island in 2008. This finding had major implications for conservation management of parrots in New Zealand, including the critically endangered kakapo (Strigops habroptilus) and orange fronted parakeet (Cyanoramphus malherbi). Feather loss had also been reported in RCP on nearby Tiritiri Matangi Island, suspected to be caused by BFDV. BFDV is endemic in the exotic Eastern rosella (Platycercus eximius) and Sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita) on the North Island of New Zealand. A spill over event likely spread the vims to RCP on nearby islands in the Hauraki Gulf of the Auckland region. Four cross-sectional surveys were conducted between 201 1 - 2012 on Tiritiri Matangi Island to determine the presence, prevalence and seasonal trends of key diseases of parrots that may result in feather loss. A total of 184 birds were captured in mist nets. All birds were anaesthetised to collect samples of blood, feathers and faeces, and in 2012 a skin biopsy from the head was included. Individuals were examined for general condition including stages of moult and body weight, and morphometrics and standardised photos were obtained. Hippoboscid flies were collected opportunistically when observed on birds. Blood and feather samples were tested for BFDV by PCR, and a subset of samples was tested for the presence of antibodies to BFDV using the haemagglutination inhibition test. Skin was processed routinely for histopathology and examined under light microscopy for evidence of BFDV as well as other causes of feather loss. The prevalence of feather loss in the study population changed substantially during the 2 year project, from 0...|$|R
40|$|Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) is a {{single-stranded}} DNA {{virus that}} is the etiological agent of beak and feather disease in both wild and captive parrots. Given that BFDV is globally recognized as a conservation threat for wild parrots, between 2011 - 2013, red-crowned parakeets (<b>Cyanoramphus</b> <b>novaezelandiae,</b> n = 229), which are endemic to New Zealand, were captured in mist nets on Tiritiri Matangi Island and Hauturu-o-Toi/Little Barrier Island (LBI), New Zealand, for disease surveillance. Blood and feathers from all birds were tested by PCR for BFDV, and full genomes were recovered and sequenced. A subset of blood samples (n = 96) were tested for antibodies to BFDV by the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. A further 238 feather samples were obtained from red-crowned parakeets from three sites in the Wellington region of the North Island, and these were screened for BFDV. The DNA-based prevalence of BFDV infection determined on Tiritiri Matangi Island was 1. 09 % (CI 95 %, 0. 1 - 3. 9 %); on Hauturu-o-Toi/LBI, 4. 4 % (95 % CI, 0. 5 %- 15. 1 %); on Kapiti Island, 3. 4 % (CI 95 %, 1. 1 - 7. 8 %); at the ZEALANDIA-Karori sanctuary, 1. 6 % (95 % CI, 0 - 8. 4 %); and on Matiu-Somes Island, 0 % (CI 95 %, 0 - 12. 3 %). Seroprevalence for BFDV, indicating prior or current exposure, in the Tiritiri Matangi Island population, it was 2 % (CI 95 %, 0 - 10. 1 %), and in the Hauturu-o-Toi/LBI population was 14 % (CI 95 %, 5. 3 - 27. 9 %). BFDV-positive birds {{showed no signs of}} clinical disease, with the exception of an individual bird obtained opportunistically from Shakespear Regional Park during the study period, which had classical signs of feather loss. Phylogenetic analysis of the 11 full genome sequences recovered from BFDV-positive red-crowned parakeets revealed evidence of ongoing viral flow between red-crowned parakeets and eastern rosellas (Platycercus eximius) in the Hauraki Gulf/Auckland region, with separate but closely related strains from the Wellington region of the North Island. This is the first study to report HI results for a New Zealand endemic parrot species, and the first epidemiological analysis of serial cross-sectional surveys in a BFDV-infected population of red-crowned parakeets in New Zealand. We postulate that although BFDV remains a threat to small, isolated or naïve populations of parrots globally, the low viral prevalence in this and other studies suggests that native parakeets in New Zealand may act as dead-end or spillover hosts...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the release techniques, post-release survival and behavioural ecology of hihi (Notiomystis cincta), a rare New Zealand honeyeater. It aims at offering management strategies for translocated populations. The only self-sustaining population of hihi exists on Little Barrier Island. The New Zealand Department of Conservation is trying to establish self-sustaining populations elsewhere. In 1991 and 1992 hihi transfers to Kapiti Island were approached in an experimental way. Experiments provided four main conclusions: (1) immediate-release birds survived better than delayed-release birds; (2) {{there was no difference between}} the survival of birds released in pairs or in a group; (3) hihi released in the absence of resident conspecifics survived better than those released in their presence; and (4) birds released in the absence of resident conspecifics moved to an area with residents in three days. The breeding system of hihi is highly variable, including monogamy, polyandry, polygyny and polygynandry. Males have physical features found in other species with highly variable mating systems. Male and female hihi benefit from a mixed reproductive strategy where a female hihi can solicit copulations from males other than her partner and male hihi can perform extra-pair copulations both with willing females or by forced copulation. Field tests aimed at determining the influence of the distribution of food and nest sites on the choice of mating system by hihi are proposed. The phenology of a selected group of plants, important as honeyeater food, was followed from 1992 to 1994. The onset and length of the flowering and fruiting periods for particular plant species varied between the years. The number of fruits and flowers per tree also varied. Hihi egg laying periods coincided with the period of greatest flowering. Hihi breeding success was low every year. In 1993 - 94 there was great competition for nest sites with kakariki <b>Cyanoramphus</b> <b>novaezelandiae.</b> It is suggested that hihi failure to establish self-sustaining populations on Kapiti Island is mainly the result of competition for nest sites and food limitation. It is recommended that feeding stations and nesting boxes are established in three different areas of the island. Food should be provided during the breeding season. The quality of nectar in some small flowers, and the rate of flower visitation by hihi, tui Prosthemadera novaezelandiae and bellbirds Anthornis melanura to those flowers were measured. The estimated nectar consumption rate for all flowers was enough to sustain hihi and bellbirds' energetic requirements. It is suggested that honeyeaters might play a previously unrecognised but important role in pollination. Forest regeneration on the New Zealand mainland could be hampered by the loss of hihi and serious reduction in the abundance of tui and bellbirds. Necessary studies to elucidate the role of honeyeaters in pollination are offered...|$|R
40|$|The way {{in which}} most animals sense and {{interpret}} the environment around them differs from species to species. Even two closely related species such as the red-crowned parakeet (<b>Cyanoramphus</b> <b>novaezelandiae)</b> and the Antipodes Island parakeet (C. unicolor) may respond to the same stimulus in very different ways. Individual birds can also show different personality traits or temperament phenotypes when presented with a novel environment. Despite being closely related, the two species {{used in this study}} have evolved in different natural habitats and use different foraging strategies. The Antipodes Island parakeets are naturally found on a group of sub-Antarctic islands known as the Antipodes Islands where they live in the tussock and sledge fields that cover the large islands and feed on the grasses and other vegetation. The red-crowned parakeets {{can be found on the}} small remnants of podocarp forests around New Zealand where they can be seen living in the canopy and on the forest floor, where they feed on mostly fruits, flowers and berries with a small proportion of invertebrates. I postulated that the evolutionary selection pressures on these two species will have resulted in differing behaviour and sensory physiology that could be measured in an experimental setting. Five individuals from each species was presented with four options in four different sensory experiments (sound, taste, colour and smell). The four different options were presented on top of a metal pole that was placed in each corner within a 1 m 3 perspex box. The behaviours shown by the birds over each 20 -minute testing period was recorded and analysed in terms of both sensory preferences and personality traits. Each sensory experiment was repeated four times with each of the 10 birds. This mean that each bird was tested a total of 16 times (four repeats for each of the four sensory tests). The Antipodes Island parakeets showed interest in all four sensory experiments and spent time investigating all of the options presented to them, but showed the clearest preference for the olfactory stimulus of carrion. They were overall more active and showed a lower level of neophobia towards the novel environment of the testing apparatus. The red-crowned parakeets showed the opposite reaction to the novel environment of the testing apparatus by being less active and preferring to stay in one place rather than investigating more of the testing box. The red-crowned parakeets also only showed interest in the colour sensory test spending more time investigating the four colour options more than any other sensory option. Both the Antipodes Island parakeet and the red-crowned parakeets were captive bred and raised in the same captive facility. This meant that all the birds were exposed to the same captive environment and may have a low level of genetic diversity. The results of this study showed that even though all the birds were raised in the same conditions there were still measurable differences between the two species in behaviour and sensory choices. This suggests that in each species, some innate behaviours driven by evolutionary selection on their ancestor’s life history have persisted despite their common early learning environment in captivity...|$|R
