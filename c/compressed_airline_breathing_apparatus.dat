50|$|A {{self-contained}} <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> (SCBA) {{sometimes referred}} to as a compressed air <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> (CABA), or simply <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> (BA), is a device worn by rescue workers, firefighters, and others to provide breathable air in an immediately dangerous to life or health atmosphere (IDLH). When not used underwater, they are sometimes called industrial breathing sets. The term self-contained means that the breathing set is not dependent on a remote supply (e.g., through a long hose). If designed for use under water, it is called SCUBA (self-contained underwater <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus).</b>|$|R

5000|$|Protection {{is divided}} up into three {{categories}} of personal protective equipment, Full, BA and BA for fire only. Full denotes that full personal protective equipment provisions must be used around and {{in contact with the}} chemical, which will usually include a portable <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> and water tight and chemical proof suit. BA (acronym for <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus)</b> specifies that a portable <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> must be used at all times in and around the chemical, and BA for fire only specifies that a <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> is not necessary for short exposure periods to the chemical but is required if the chemical is on alight. BA for fire only is denoted within the emergency action code as a white letter on a black background, while a black letter on a white background denotes <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> at all times. When changing the background colour is not possible (such as with handwriting), the use of brackets means the same as a black background.

40|$|In {{the current}} {{practice}} of the Mining Rescue Service of the Czech Republic, since 2005, the insulated overpressure regenerative <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatuses</b> with a closed circuit and supply of medicinal oxygen are used as the backbone working <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatuses.</b> At {{the end of the}} year 2010, the compressed-air <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatuses</b> were introduced into the {{practice of the}} Mining Rescue Service of the Czech Republic, which, in precisely defined types of mine rescue service interventions and under precisely defined conditions, can replace the aforementioned backbone working insulated overpressure regenerative <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatuses.</b> Recently, mining rescue services in deep coal mines have been more and more often conducted under conditions of an irrespirable mine atmosphere containing high concentrations of carbon monoxide, but at the same time containing sufficient oxygen for the breathing physiology of mine rescuer (for example, interventions dealing with the disposal of machinery under conditions of occurrence of endogenous mining fire of coal). This fact, after a long time, has resumed again the discussion of miners' rescue experts about whether it would be possible to implement the use of <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatuses</b> filtrating carbon monoxide into practice by the Mining Rescue Services of the Czech Republic in order to ensure a sufficient level of safety for mining rescuers even in an unexpected and rapid decline of the oxygen amount in the mine air at the site of the mine rescue service. The benefit of the <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatuses</b> filtrating carbon monoxide is their significantly lower weight, long protection period and also significantly smaller dimensions and design variability of the device. The disadvantages are higher breathing resistances and a higher temperature of the air mass inhaled from the <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> filtrating carbon monoxide...|$|R
5000|$|Immersion {{swimming}} with <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> (also {{known by its}} acronym, IM, and as immersion) is underwater swimming using mask, monofin and underwater <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> conducted in a swimming pool. While there are no requirements on how a <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> is carried, it cannot be exchanged or abandoned during a race. IM races are held for distances of 100 and 400 m. A swimmer's face must be immersed {{for the duration of}} the race or risk disqualification. IM races are not conducted in open water for 'safety and security reasons'. [...] Historically, IM swims were conducted in openwater up to distances of 1000m.|$|R
