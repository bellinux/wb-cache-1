40|$|A new {{computerised}} design {{model for}} the buckling strength assessment of stiffened panels is presented. The overall formulation is very general, and in principle, any type of stiffening arrangements of open or <b>closed</b> <b>profile</b> type, corrugations etc. can be analysed. The model {{is based on an}} orthotropic version of Marguerre’s non-linear plate theory. The stiffened panel is treated as an integrated unit, allowing for internal redistribution of membrane stresses between component plates, while preventing overall buckling and permanent deformations/sets. By using non-linear plate theory, the strength model is more theoretical consistent than existing code formulations, which are mainly based on empirical curve fitting to a limited number of numerical and experimental results. Complicated items such as bi-axial loading combined with in-plane shear loads and non-linear mode interaction problems are dealt with in a sound physical framework, and empirical approximations are reduced to a minimum. The model also provides a set of reduced anisotropic/orthotropic macro material coefficients {{that can be used in}} refined linear global FE analysis of ship hulls to reflect the increased membrane flexibility experienced by compressed stiffened panels. This area of application allows for redistribution of loads between gross elements such as stiffened panels, frames, girders and bulkheads and ensures a more realistic assessment of the nominal stress flow in a ship hull. The presented model is planned to constitute the basis for a new DNV buckling procedure for stiffened panels...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a {{non-traditional}} cam and roller-follower mechanism is described here. In this mechanism, the roller-crank rather than the cam is used as the continuous input member, while both complete a full rotation in each revolution and remain in contact throughout. It is noted {{that in order to}} have the cam fully rotate for every full rotation of the roller-crank, the cam cannot be a <b>closed</b> <b>profile,</b> rather the roller tra-verses the open cam profile twice in each cycle. Using kinematic analysis, the angular velocity of the cam when the roller traverses the cam profile in one direction, is related to the angular velocity of the cam when the roller retraces its path on the cam in the other direction. Thus, one can specify any arbitrary function relating the motion of the cam to the motion of the roller-crank for only 180 ° of rotation in the angular velocity space. The motion of the cam in the remaining portion is then automatically determined. In specifying the arbitrary motion, many desirable characteristics such as multiple dwells, low acceleration and jerk, etc., can be obtained. Useful design equations are derived for this purpose. Using the kinematic in-version technique, the cam profile is readily obtained once the motion is specified in the angular velocity space. The only limitation to the arbitrary motion specification is making sure that the transmission angle never gets too low, so that the force will be transmitted eciently from roller to cam. This is addressed by incorporating a transmission index into the motion specification in the synthesis process. Consequently, in this method we can specify any arbitrary motion within a permissible zone, such that the transmission index is higher than the specified minimum value. Single-dwell, double-dwell and a long hesitation motion are used as examples to demonstrate the eectiveness of the design method. Force closure using an optimall...|$|E
40|$|Incremental {{launching}} of steel bridges is a demanding undertaking, on the erection site {{as well as}} on the designers desk. Not seldom, the structure itself is during the launching subjected to high concentrated forces on the lower flange when passing over the launching shoe or a intermediate support (e. g. column). These concentrated forces, commonly referred to as patch loads, may be of such magnitude that it governs the thickness of the web in the bridge girder and a small increase in web thickness leads to a substantial gain of steel weight of the bridge. Hence also a higher material cost. One solution to this problem is to reduce the buckling length of the web with the use of a longitudinal stiffener of open (a plate) or closed type (<b>closed</b> <b>profile</b> of e. g. V-shape). The improved patch load resistance is in the Eurocode nowadays determined with the help of the yield resistance for the web and contributing parts of the loaded flange reduced with a factor dependent of the slenderness of the web and the influence of the longitudinal stiffener. Parts in the expressions for the yield resistance and the reduction factor have been somewhat questioned and over the years a substantial amount of tests and FE simulations of longitudinally stiffened webs has been carried out. This research work has produced a large amount of test data which has been used herein to further improve the prediction of the patch load resistance of longitudinally stiffened steel girder webs. Based on the use of the gathered test data from the literature and previously done research, a calibrated patch load resistance function was developed for both open and closed longitudinal stiffeners. Furthermore, a partial safety factor for the proposal was determined according to the guidelines in the Eurocode. In all, the proposal was proven to have an improved level of prediction than other comparable proposals (e. g. Eurocode). Another questioned part in the commonly used design codes is the reduction function concerning local buckling under uniformly in-plane compression. The nowadays used function (the Winter function) has been developed during the 30 -ies based on tests on cold formed specimens and has been criticized as being too optimistic regarding plates with large welds. At LTU a series of tests on welded specimens made of high strength steel with large welds was conducted to investigate the aforementioned concerns. Along with test data found in a literature survey, the tests showed that the Winter function was shown to be too optimistic and a new reduction function, based on the test data, was proposed also for this application.

As a result, a method has been developed at the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU which allows the integration of press hardening of tubes and <b>closed</b> <b>profiles</b> into the media-based forming process. Using this press hardening technology, the original material strength of 500 MPa can be increased to between 1200 and 1900 MPa, depending on the chosen material.

To control and improve the process and therefore the part quality and process reliability, all these factors and their dependencies have to be taken into account. In addition to 22 MnB 5, other manganese-boron alloyed steels and different heating strategies have been tested.

For instance, a load acting in a cross-sectional plane of a beam is considered to induce not only bending and torsion but also distortion. The distortion produces non-uniform shear and axial stresses together with a non-uniform warping of the cross-section. These resulting effects, significant for very thin-walled open <b>profiles</b> (and thin-walled <b>closed</b> <b>profiles</b> with high distortional loadings), are shown in this paper to be important when compared to bending and torsion stresses even in simple loading cases. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
