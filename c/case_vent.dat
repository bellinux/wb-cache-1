50|$|Two Thiokol solid-propellant motors powered the Pershing 1 missile. Since a solid-propellant motor {{cannot be}} turned off, the missile used thrust {{reversal}} and <b>case</b> <b>venting</b> for selective range. Splice bands and explosive bolts attached the rocket motors. The missile {{was controlled by}} an analog guidance computer using a ball-and-disk integrator and a control computer. As directed by the onboard computers, the bolts exploded and ejected the splice band. Another squib would open the thrust reversal ports in the forward end of the stage and ignite the propellant in the forward end, causing the motor to reverse direction. Testing found that the second stage would draft behind the warhead and cause it to drift off course, so explosive charges {{on the side of}} the motor opened the <b>case</b> and <b>vented</b> the propellant. The range could be graduated but the maximum was 740 km. Jet vanes in the motor nozzles and air vanes on the motor case steered the missile. The onboard analog guidance computer and the Eclipse-Pioneer ST-120 (Stable Table-120) inertial navigation system provided guidance. The warhead could be conventional explosive or a W50 nuclear weapon with three yield options— the Y1 with 60 kiloton yield, Y2 with 200 kiloton yield and Y3 with 400 kiloton yield; the conventional warhead was never deployed.|$|R

40|$|We have {{discovered}} a previously unidentified thermal explosion mode using the Los Alamos deflagration cylinder test (DFCT). The DFCT is a “pipe bomb”-style test similar to the detonation cylinder test (DTCT), which {{has been used for}} many years to calibrate detonation product equations of state. The shot is heated in an oven to a uniform test temperature. The pre-heated high explosive (HE) is triggered by a hot wire initiator on one end. The tube is back-illuminated by a bright light source, and its combustion-driven deformation and subsequent break-up are observed by a high-speed framing camera. Like the DTCT, the DFCT tube wall motion provides the primary diagnostic. A variety of reactive responses are possible, including quasi-steady deflagration and deflagration-to-detonation transition. This paper focuses on the behavior of the HMX-based explosive PBX 9501 at 155 C. Under this condition burning appeared to occur only at the HE/tube interface, causing the tube to peel away from the HE core. Peel-off propagated as a wave that traveled along the tube at ∼ 500 m/s. This failure mode resulted in vigorous <b>case</b> <b>venting,</b> but the response was otherwise benign. We derive a steady peel-off-wave model that reproduces the essential observed features for realistic PBX 9501 parameter values...|$|R

40|$|The Stability in Waves {{committee}} of the 27 th ITTC has nvestigated the significance of scale effects in air pressure on flooding model tests under atmospheric conditions. For this purpose, the committee classified the flooding cases into the trapped air <b>case</b> and <b>vented</b> air <b>cases,</b> and investigated the flooding process for a simple geometry using the state equation of air and the orifice equation. As a result, the committee concluded that the scale effect is large for the case of trapped air and small vent area. For the other cases, the effect is small and can therefore be neglected in the model test of a damaged ship.

40|$|AbstractAn rf-driven {{reaction}} cell {{offers the}} potential for enormous efficiency in the removal of interfering ions prior to mass analysis in inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Concomitant with this efficiency {{is the potential for}} interference production within the reaction cell. Operation of a low rf-amplitude quadrupole reaction cell in a bandpass mode, either rf-only or with additional dc voltage between pole pairs, is shown to suppress these in-cell interferences. Examples of various types of interferences (spectral and continuum) are shown, and their elimination without sacrificing sensitivity is demonstrated. The advantage of dynamically sweeping the bandpass in concert with the mass analyzer is shown.

Results show that incorporating the SOFC is not beneficial in <b>cases</b> where <b>venting</b> hydrogen overboard is permissible. However, when venting hydrogen is not permissible - which is the situation for most missions - the HAC-SOFC provides a 5 to 7 fold increase in range/endurance compared to equivalent battery powered systems.

Pointed rounds give bullets a better ballistic coefficient, improving the effective range of the cartridge by decreasing aerodynamic drag.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the poor}} level of {{photosynthetic}} light reaching deep-sea environments, most fish need to rely on organic matter sinking from higher levels, or, in rare <b>cases,</b> hydrothermal <b>vents</b> for nutrients. This makes the deep-sea much poorer in productivity than shallower regions. Also, animals in the pelagic environment are sparse and food doesn’t come along frequently. Because of this, organisms need adaptations {{that allow them to}} survive. Some have long feelers to help them locate prey or attract mates in the pitch black of the deep ocean. The deep-sea angler fish in particular has a long fishing-rod-like adaptation protruding from its face, on the end of which is a bioluminescent piece of skin that wriggles like a worm to lure its prey. Some must consume other fish that are the same size or larger than them and they need adaptations to help digest them efficiently. Great sharp teeth, hinged jaws, disproportionately large mouths, and expandable bodies {{are a few of the}} characteristics that deep-sea fishes have for this purpose. The gulper eel is one example of an organism that displays these characteristics.|$|R
40|$|Body {{condition}} {{is important because}} it is correlated with population and habitat quality parameters. Since the direct measurements are either lethal or unreliable, a wide range of non-lethal body condition indices has been proposed. The aim of our study was to apply and compare three body condition indices (Fulton's index, relative body condition mass index and residual index) using body size indicator - body mass data for 24 populations of the yellow bellied toad (Bombina variegata). The condition index should be independent of body size indicator, in this <b>case</b> snout <b>vent</b> length (SVL). Therefore we tested all three indices for the statistical independence of SVL and for the normality of distribution. Fulton's index violated the independence assumption, whereas the relative body condition mass index did not have a normal distribution. Residual index was found both independent of SVL and normally distributed. Moreover, the residual index highlighted biological significant differences on the basis of altitude and season. Our results recommend the residual index as a useful tool in amphibian monitoring and conservation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} a set of operating points of a fan built in ventilation system of our test car. These operating points are given by the fan pressure characteristics and are defined by a pressure drop of the HVAC system (air ducts and vents) and volumetric flow rate of ventilation air. To cover a wide range of pressure drops situations, four <b>cases</b> of <b>vent</b> flaps setup were examined: (1) all vents opened, (2) only central vents closed (3) only central vents opened and (4) all vents closed. To cover a different volumetric flows, the each case was measured at least for four different speeds of fan defined by the fan voltage. It was observed that the pressure difference of the fan is proportional to the fan voltage and strongly depends on the throttling of the air distribution system by the settings of the <b>vents</b> flaps. In <b>case</b> of our test car we identified correlations between volumetric flow rate of ventilation air, fan pressure difference and fan voltage.

50|$|VRLA Gel and AGM {{batteries}} offer {{several advantages}} compared with VRLA flooded lead acid and conventional standard lead-acid batteries. The battery can be mounted in any position, since the valves only operate on over-pressure faults. Since the battery {{system is designed}} to be recombinant and eliminate the emission of gases on overcharge, room ventilation requirements are reduced, and no acid fume is emitted during normal operation. Flooded cell gas emissions are of little consequence in all but the smallest confined areas, and pose very little threat to a domestic user, so a wet cell battery designed for longevity gives lower costs per kWh. In a gel battery, the volume of free electrolyte that could be released on damage to the <b>case</b> or <b>venting</b> is very small. There is no need (or ability) to check the level of electrolyte or to top up water lost due to electrolysis, reducing inspection and maintenance requirements. Wet cell batteries can be maintained by a self-watering system or by topping up every three months. The requirement to add distilled water is normally caused by overcharging. A well-regulated system should not require top-up more often than every three months.|$|R

40|$|Runaway {{reactions}} {{are characterized by}} the exponential increase of the temperature and pressure of a chemical system that could potentially lead to {{the explosion of the}} reactor or storage vessel of concern. The consequences of a runaway reaction may be very severe in terms of life, economic and environmental losses. Emergency relief systems (ERS) are the ultimate mitigation method to prevent vessel explosion following the runaway reaction. In the case of the runaway of gas producing chemical systems, ERS sizing requires the assessment of the maximum gas production rates. Significant work was performed in the 1980 ?s by the Design Institute for Emergency Relief Systems to develop vent sizing methods for runaway reaction <b>cases.</b> While <b>vent</b> sizing methods developed for vapor systems provided relatively good results, those developed for gas generating systems (hybrid or gassy) tend to be oversized and still need to be improved. A very significant part of this work includes the improvement of the current methods for the measurements of the maximum gas production rate for such systems. The objective of this thesis work is to experimentally study the decomposition of a gas generating system under runaway condition using adiabatic calorimetry and assess the maximum gas production rate corresponding to the runaway. A critical analysis of the current methodologies to interpret experimental data to compute the maximum gas production rate was done.

40|$|An {{interesting}} {{transport phenomenon}} is observed through openings between two compartments {{separated by a}} thin, vented, horizontal partition such as those between containment internals in nuclear power systems, in industrial installations in event of fire, passive cooling of heated structures and in natural building ventilation. A heavier fluid located {{on the top of}} a lighter fluid and separated by a horizontal vent constitutes a gravitationally unstable system. Horizontal vents produce flow, which are unstable with irregular oscillatory behavior. The objective of the present work was to simulate such type of flow across a circular opening in horizontal partition in presence of buoyancy force. Unsteady, axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations have been solved with Finite Volume Method. The equations were solved using the in-house CFD code based upon the well-established pressure-based finite volume methodology. In terms of temporal differencing second order accurate Crank-Nicolson scheme was used. Interpolation to cell faces for the convective terms was performed using a third order QUICK scheme, second order central differencing was used for the viscous terms. Pressure-velocity coupling was based on the SIMPLE procedure. The upper chamber was filled with salt water and the lower chamber with fresh water, creating a density differential between the two chambers. Opposing forces at the interface created a gravitationally unstable system, and an oscillating exchange of fluid developed.

There has been an assumption that these plastic panels will melt and provide smoke and heat venting during a fire. The plastics commonly used in New Zealand, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polycarbonate, acrylic and glass fibre-reinforced polyester (GRP) have been tested in small scale experiments to further the understanding of the behaviour of the materials at elevated temperatures. The behaviour of particular interest is the effectiveness of the skylight as a vent for hot buoyant gases. Small scale experiments have been conducted to find the mass flow rate of an unobstructed vent. Experiments have then been carried out on samples of the four skylight materials for a range of exposure temperatures and times. The mass flow has been measured for the deformed sample and compared to the unobstructed flow. The results of the small scale experiments have been analysed and an empirical relationship has been developed for the PVC and polycarbonate material. The acrylic behaviour does not provide enough data to include it in the empirical relationship. The GRP failed to melt and was therefore also excluded from the empirical relationship.

We present an analysis of the susceptibility to lava flow invasion in Goma, by means of computer simulations based on the steepest descent path and probabilisticcomputed flow spreading and obstacle overcoming. The DEM is obtained from a topographic map of Goma by using the DEST algorithm.

The benchmark problem SBEP-V 20 covers release scenarios that were experimentally investigated in the past using helium as a substitute to hydrogen. The aim of the experimental investigations was to determine the ventilation requirements for parking hydrogen fuelled vehicles in residential garages. Helium was released under the vehicle for 2 h with 7. 200 l/h flow rate. The leak rate corresponded to a 20 % drop of the peak power of a 50 kW fuel cell vehicle. Three double vent garage door geometries are considered in this numerical investigation. In each <b>case</b> the <b>vents</b> are located at {{the top and bottom of}} the garage door. The vents vary only in height. In the first case, the height of the vents is 0. 063 m, in the second 0. 241 m and in the third 0. 495 m. Four HySafe partners participated in this benchmark. The following CFD packages with the respective models were applied to simulate the experiments: ADREA-HF using k-epsilon model by partner NCSRD, FLACS using k-epsilon model by partner DNV, FLUENT using k-epsilon model by partner UPM and CFX using laminar and the low-Re number SST model by partner JAC.

40|$|The {{great variety}} of {{geological}} and hydrological conditions in the deep sea generates many different habitats. Some are only recently explored, although their true extent and geographical coverage are still not fully established. Both continental margins and mid-oceanic seafloors are much more complex ecologically, geologically, chemically and hydrodynamically than originally thought. As a result, fundamental patterns of species distribution first observed and explained {{in the context of}} relatively monotonous slopes and abyssal plains must now be re-evaluated in the light of this newly recognized habitat heterogeneity. Based on a global database of nematode genus composition, collected as part of the Census of Marine Life, we show that macrohabitat heterogeneity contributes significantly to total deep-sea nematode diversity on a global scale. Different deep-sea settings harbour specific nematode assemblages. Some of them, like coral rubble zones or nodule areas, are very diverse habitats. Factors such as increased substrate complexity in the case of nodules and corals seem to facilitate the co-existence {{of a large number of}} genera with different modes of life, ranging from sediment dwelling to epifaunal. Furthermore, strong biochemical gradients in the <b>case</b> of <b>vents</b> or seeps are responsible for the success of particular genera, which are not prominent in more typical soft sediments. Many nematode deep-sea genera are cosmopolitan, inhabiting a variety of deep-sea habitats and oceans, whereas only 21 % of all deep-sea genera recorded are restricted to a single habitat. In addition to habitat heterogeneity, regional differences are important in structuring nematode assemblages. For instance, seeps from different regions yield different genera that thrive on the sulphidic sediments. This study also shows that many areas and habitats remain highly under-sampled, affecting our ability to understand fully the contribution of habitat heterogeneity versus regional differences to global nematode diversity...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWhen a {{fixed roof}} storage tank is {{surrounded}} by a pool fire, and when the vents are not correctly dimensioned, the inside pressure can raise until the mechanical limits of the structure. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a tool that will allow to follow the variations of the pressure and temperature in the gas phase, as a function of the size of the vent. This will help the sizing of new tank's vents or evaluating the risk of already build structures. The model also gives the temperature's distribution in the liquid phase, at each time step. In <b>case</b> of undersized <b>vents,</b> this information will be convenient to describe the phenomenological aspect of the accident after the rupture of the tank i. e., to qualify and quantify the fire ball generated and its effect on persons and structures. Currently, if few analytical models exist to quantify the fire ball and its effects after the rupture, none are able to describe with accuracy the prerupture phenomena. The tool developed takes into account the two phases of the accident and allows to study complete and consistent scenari...|$|R
40|$|Analytical and {{experimental}} laboratory studies were conducted for rapid pressurizing of entrapped gas {{at the end}} of a horizontal liquid pipeline. In this paper analytical {{and experimental}} model study are presented for pressurizing entrapped gas pocket {{at the end of}} a liquid column in a horizontal pipeline. Analytical models are considered such as (1) acoustic effect of both liquid and gas side, (2) variation of liquid length, and (3) thermal damping process. Closed form of solutions were derived for a lumped liquid and lumped gas model if pipeline is a horizontal. Experiments were conducted to verify the analytical models. Comparison of analytical and experimental model results were presented. 	Analytical model was developed to define the physics behind the gas <b>venting</b> <b>case.</b> Experiments were conducted for a range of orifice sizes from 1 / 16 to of the pipe diameter with reservoir pressure two, three and four times of ambient pressure for five different pipe configurations. Experimental results confirm the assumption of modified entrapped air model is correct. Ph. D.

40|$|Haemolysis in {{cardiac surgery}} {{is a common}} {{intractable}} problem, the consequences of which are still undervalued. Every study on this topic has attracted considerable interest, and the paper of Ricci et al. cannot be overlooked [1]. There are two main causes of haemolysis during cardiac surgery: effect of extracorporeal circulation support devices on patient’s blood (cardiopulmonary bypass, extracorporeal mem-brane oxygenation, cell salvage, etc.) and red blood cell transfusion. Certainly, mech-anically induced haemolysis occupies the leading position in cardiac surgery. Lack of significant effect of transfusion in the above study {{may be due to}} small variance in dose or age of transfused red blood cells (RBCs), but it cannot be ignored. It is impos-sible to completely eliminate haemolysis when using extracorporeal circulation support devices; that depends not only on the device design features, but also on the procedure conditions in each <b>case</b> (left atrial <b>venting</b> flow, suction intensity, venous and arterial cannula position, etc). Increased free haemoglobin level causes dysregu-lation of vascular tone and tissue oxygenation due to decreased NO bioavailability, increased oxidative stress, and damage to kidney tubules [2]. It is worth noting tha...|$|R
