50|$|<b>Cefpimizole</b> (INN) is {{a third-generation}} {{cephalosporin}} antibiotic.|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of <b>cefpimizole</b> (formerly U- 63196 E) was {{compared with that}} of other broad-spectrum cephalosporins and penicillins. Overall, <b>cefpimizole</b> exhibited limited activity against gram-positive cocci and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae as compared with the other cephalosporins tested. The {{activity of}} <b>cefpimizole</b> against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefoperazone and mezlocillin (90 % MIC, 32 micrograms/ml) but poorer than that of ceftazidime (90 % MIC, 8 micrograms/ml). <b>Cefpimizole</b> appears to have no in vitro advantage over the cephalosporins with which it was compared...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>cefpimizole</b> (free acid equivalents of <b>cefpimizole</b> sodium), a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic, {{were determined}} after single- and multiple-dose 20 -min intravenous infusions of 1, 2, and 4 g. The kinetics of single-dose administration of <b>cefpimizole</b> correspond to a two-compartment model {{with an average}} apparent volume of distribution of 20. 0 +/- 3. 5 liters, a distribution rate constant of 2. 24 +/- 1. 00 h- 1, and a terminal rate constant of 0. 358 +/- 0. 036 h- 1 (half-life, 1. 9 h). The total body clearance was 118. 6 +/- 20. 2 ml/min. The primary route of elimination for <b>cefpimizole</b> was the renal route, with approximately 80 % of the administered dose excreted as the parent compound. The elimination rate constant, as calculated from urinary excretion data, was 0. 339 +/- 0. 043 h- 1, which is {{in close agreement with}} the terminal rate constant for plasma. Renal clearance of <b>cefpimizole</b> was 96. 2 +/- 17. 3 ml/min. Dose proportionality over the three dose levels was obtained from area under the plasma curve and cumulative urinary excretion data. The results of the multiple-dose study indicated that no apparent change in the distribution or elimination kinetics of <b>cefpimizole</b> occurred after the administration of 1 -, 2 -, and 4 -g doses for 7 days, three times a day. The kinetics from the multiple-dose study were in close agreement with those from the single-dose study. No accumulation of <b>cefpimizole</b> occurred, and nondetectable levels was observed 24 h after administration of the last dose. Peaks that could be attributed to metabolites of <b>cefpimizole</b> were not observed during high-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of either plasma or urine specimens...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cefpimizole</b> was {{compared}} with cefoperazone and cefotaxime against 6, 599 clinical bacterial isolates from five medical centers. Cefoperazone and cefotaxime were both {{more active and}} provided a greater spectrum of antimicrobial coverage than <b>cefpimizole.</b> Some of the <b>cefpimizole</b> minimum concentrations inhibiting 50 % of tested strains were as follows: Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae, 16 micrograms/ml; Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2. 0 micrograms/ml; Proteus mirabilis, 1. 0 microgram/ml; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 micrograms/ml; Staphylococcus spp., 32 micrograms/ml; and the enterococci, greater than 32 micrograms/ml...|$|E
40|$|Four new cephalosporins, cefotaxime, <b>cefpimizole</b> (U 63196 E), BMY 28142, and HR 810 were {{evaluated}} in experimental pneumococcal meningitis. Cefotaxime penetrated only moderately into the cerebrospinal fluid of rabbits with meningitis, whereas <b>cefpimizole,</b> BMY 28142, and HR 810 all exhibited unusually good penetration. The bactericidal activity in infected cerebrospinal fluid was comparable {{for the four}} drugs...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a two-center dose ranging study {{to evaluate the}} efficacy, tolerance, and toxicity of <b>cefpimizole,</b> a new cephalosporin, {{in the treatment of}} uncomplicated gonorrhea in 96 males. Twelve patients at each center were treated intramuscularly with single doses of 1. 0, 0. 5, 0. 25, and 0. 125 g of <b>cefpimizole.</b> All urethral infections were cured at the highest dose, but lower doses produced progressively decreasing cure rates of 90 % (0. 5 g), 83 % (0. 25 g), and 71 % (0. 125 g). Treatment failures of rectal and pharyngeal infections occurred at the highest dose level. Geometric mean MICs for <b>cefpimizole</b> for successfully and unsuccessfully treated volunteers were 0. 088 and 0. 282 micrograms/ml, respectively. A prominent adverse effect was clinically significant pain at the injection site, which occurred in 57 (59 %) of 96 patients. Results of the study demonstrate that <b>cefpimizole</b> offers no advantage over currently available antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea in men...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cefpimizole</b> sodium (AC- 1370, U- 63196 E) was {{administered}} intramuscularly in doses from 100 mg (0. 5 ml) to 2, 000 mg (two 3. 5 -ml doses) to healthy human volunteers in three double-blind placebo and positive-controlled (cefotaxime, cephalothin) single-dose studies {{and in two}} multiple-dose studies. Mild transient pain was observed at the injection site, but no erythema, petechia, necrosis, or atrophy was noted. Creatinine phosphokinase values were increased during the study in the cefpimizole- and placebo-treated groups but began to return to normal {{toward the end of}} the study period (day 5). They were not paralleled by a similar magnitude of elevation in serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase or by pain and tenderness. There were no clinically meaningful or statistically significant changes (P greater than 0. 5) or trends in vital signs and no other patterns of drug-related clinical abnormalities noted in any of the laboratory measurements evaluated (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis). No serious side effects occurred during or after the study. <b>Cefpimizole</b> was well tolerated locally and systemically by all the subjects at all administered dosage levels. <b>Cefpimizole</b> concentrations in serum (microbiological assay) remained above 1 microgram/ml at 12 h after drug administration for all dose levels. The median peak concentrations in plasma for the 500 - and 1, 000 -mg twice-daily dosages of <b>cefpimizole</b> were, respectively, 21. 6 and 45. 5 micrograms/ml on day 1, 16. 2 and 43. 7 micrograms/ml on day 3, and 20. 1 and 41. 4 micrograms/ml on day 6 of the study. The apparent terminal disposition half-life throughout the study was about 2. 0 h. The median amounts of <b>cefpimizole</b> excreted in the urine for the first 12 h of each day evaluated were 370 and 1, 071 mg on day 1, 416 and 972 mg on day 3, and 370 and 975 mg on day 6 for the 500 - and 1, 000 -mg twice-daily dosages, respectively. Dose proportionally of <b>cefpimizole</b> was obtained for the 500 - and 1, 000 -mg and the 2, 000 -mg groups. The absorption, distribution, and elimination of <b>cefpimizole</b> after multiple-dose intramuscular administration were uniform, were linear in relation to dose, and did not result in drug accumulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>cefpimizole</b> (free acid equivalents of <b>cefpimizole</b> sodium), a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic, {{were evaluated}} after intramuscular administration of single doses (dose range, 100 to 1, 000 mg) and multiple doses (dose range, 500 to 2, 000 mg) given b. i. d. for 6 or 11 days. The kinetics after intramuscular administration correspond to a one-compartment model with first-order input. The apparent volume of {{distribution of the}} absorbed dose averaged 18. 6 +/- 3. 4 (standard deviation) liters for 58 individuals; the absorption-phase and elimination-phase rate constants averaged 2. 53 +/- 1. 16 h- 1 (half-life, 0. 27 h) and 0. 338 +/- 0. 041 h- 1 (half-life, 2. 05 h), respectively; and the mean residence time was 3. 43 +/- 0. 43 h. The total body clearance of the absorbed dose after single-dose intramuscular administration was 102 +/- 13 ml/min. The primary route of elimination was renal with 73 to 83 % of the administered dose excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. Renal clearance averaged 81 +/- 13 ml/min. Dose proportionality was obtained from area under the plasma curve, concentration maximum in plasma, and cumulative urinary excretion levels. Multiple-dose evaluation of intramuscular administration of <b>cefpimizole</b> indicated no apparent change in the absorption or elimination phases after b. i. d. dosing for 6 or 11 days. The kinetic parameters determined from multiple-dose plasma and urine levels were {{in close agreement with}} the same parameters calculated from single-dose results. No apparent accumulation of <b>cefpimizole</b> occurred, and nondetectable levels of drug were observed in the 24 -h plasma and 24 - to 48 -h urine specimen after administration of the last dose. The kinetics of <b>cefpimizole</b> after intramuscular administration were similar to the kinetics obtained after intravenous infusion...|$|E
40|$|Many {{cephalosporin}} antibiotics {{have recently}} been invented and {{attempts have been made}} to use them clinically. The choice of which of these drugs should be used has been difficult in gynecology. The efficacies of these drugs depend on their antibacterial spectra, potencies, and concentrations in tissues. This study was designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of various cephem antibiotics in the exudate of the retroperitoneal space that is formed after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. These cephem antibiotics were cefoxitin, cefotiam, cefotetan, cefpiramide, cefminox, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, cefbuperazone, ceftazidime, <b>cefpimizole,</b> flomoxef, and cefuzonam. The maximum concentrations after administration of a 1 -g dose in the exudate of the pelvic retroperitoneal space were 37. 9 micrograms/ml with cefminox, 30. 3 micrograms/ml with <b>cefpimizole,</b> 21. 6 micrograms/ml with flomoxef, 21. 5 micrograms/ml with ceftazidime, and 17. 6 micrograms/ml with cefbuperazone, which were relatively high. When selecting antibiotics for prophylactic use against infections in the retroperitoneal space after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, on the basis of drug transfer, flomoxef, cefminox, cefbuperazone, ceftazidime, and <b>cefpimizole</b> were considered to be the drugs of first choice at a dose of 1 g...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{susceptibility}} of 406 clinical isolates to BMY- 28142, a new semisynthetic cephem, was evaluated and compared with <b>cefpimizole,</b> HR 810, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, moxalactam, and cefoperazone in a broth microdilution assay. On a weight basis, {{the activity of}} BMY- 28142 against Escherichia coli, Proteus species, and Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia was superior to the other cephems. Against gentamicin-susceptible and -resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, BMY- 28142 was more active than the other cephems, except ceftazidime and HR 810. A total of 74 % of gram-negative and 56 % of gram-positive isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins were susceptible to {{less than or equal}} to 8 micrograms of BMY- 28142 per ml. Finally, for 83 % of tested isolates, the bactericidal concentration of BMY- 28142 was within one dilution of the inhibitory concentration...|$|E
40|$|High-performance liquid {{chromatography}} {{was used to}} determine the penetration of 19 antimicrobial agents into human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The ratios of the intracellular concentration to the extracellular concentration of ampicillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, ceftizoxime, <b>cefpimizole,</b> and ceftazidime were all less than 0. 6. Lincomycin showed a high intracellular-to-extracellular ratio (3. 0), while clindamycin achieved a ratio of 15. 5, which was the highest ratio of all of the 19 tested antibiotics. Ratios for rifampin, isoniazid, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim were 8. 2, 1. 1, 9. 6, and 6. 1, respectively. Six quinolone-class antimicrobial agents had ratios from 2. 2 to 8. 2. Flucytosine showed a penetration ratio of 4. 6. Clindamycin uptake was temperature dependent and occurred best with live polymorphonuclear leukocytes; sodium fluoride, adenosine, and puromycin were inhibitory. The results obtained in this study correlate well with the results of other studies involving radioisotopic methods. This indicates that high-performance {{liquid chromatography}} is a useful method for determining the intracellular penetration of antimicrobial agents...|$|E
