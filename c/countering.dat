40|$|<b>Counters</b> are {{the basic}} {{building}} block in embedded system design. <b>Counters</b> are used for counting purpose. Similarly it is used for frequency division. <b>Counters</b> are the Sequential Circuits in which the output depends upon the previous as well as present input. Basically <b>counters</b> are classified in two categories one is Asynchronous <b>Counter</b> and another is Synchronous <b>Counter.</b> The operation of the <b>counter</b> is depending upon the clock which is a timing signal. Clock is required to change {{the state of the}} <b>counter</b> i. e. triggering. For high speed (fast response) clock is taken as negative edge triggered. <b>Counters</b> are designed using flip flops that {{are the basic}} storage elements in digital design. A sequential circuit is the combination of Combinational circuit and Memory. The present input is stored in combinational circuit and the previous input is stored in memory. There are various types of <b>counters</b> such as Ripple <b>Counter,</b> Up <b>Counter,</b> Down <b>Counter,</b> Johnson <b>Counter</b> and Synchronous <b>Counter.</b> Here we present the design of 64 bit up down <b>counter</b> & implementation is done on FPGA...|$|R

5|$|A {{team from}} the Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 that it had measured {{the density of the}} binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being less than that of water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with a layer of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. <b>Countering</b> this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus.
