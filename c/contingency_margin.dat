40|$|Eurozone {{convergence}} {{provides a}} unique opportunity for accession countries to abandon macroeconomic stabilisation policies that suffer from weak credibility. On the other hand, expectations of future improvements in macroeconomic variables and trend appreciation of the currency may undermine the relationship between interest rates, exchange rates and economic fundamentals, making the economy vulnerable to sudden changes in market sentiments regarding the timing and path to Eurozone accession. Recent developments in Hungary illustrate the impact of changing expectations on exchange rate and interest rate volatility. Two lessons {{can be drawn from}} the Hungarian experience. First, benign market sentiment and easier access to finance does not imply less pressure to correct macroeconomic imbalances in the long run. Second, convergence strategies should be robust with respect to sudden shifts in capital flows. Programmes should maintain the shock absorbing capacity of fiscal and monetary policies and offer a <b>contingency</b> <b>margin</b> to ensure compliance with the announced adjustment plan in case of unforeseen developments. Slower convergence programmes might be more successful. Comparative Economic Studies (2004) 46, 104 – 126. doi: 10. 1057 /palgrave. ces. 8100043...|$|E
30|$|Our {{feasibility}} {{analysis shows}} that QKD in an uplink scenario between a ground station and a satellite in LEO is possible using a space segment that adheres to the 12 U CubeSat standard. The SWaP analysis {{shows that the}} requirements of volume, weight, and power can be met with a comfortable <b>contingency</b> <b>margin.</b> The design of the receiver telescope with a FOV of 215 μrad guarantees a low background count rate for a ground station located on the Canary Islands (or a similar astronomical observation location) even under the assumption of operation during a full moon phase. At the same time, the FOV is large enough that the required pointing precision is within reach of current ADCS technology. We have estimated the link budget for an orbital scenario in which the satellite passes directly over the OGS, {{as well as for}} one in which its ground track passes at a distance of 500  km. For this we used conservative estimates of the uplink beam spreading due to diffraction and atmospheric turbulence. Subsequently taking conservative parameters for the detection system, and notably a large coincidence time window of 1  ns, we show that the QKD experiment is possible for both orbital scenarios as long as the DCR per detector is not much larger than 250  cps. The secure key length accumulated after one pass would be 1 · 10 ^ 5 and 1.3 · 10 ^ 4 bit for the direct and distant overpass, respectively, for a Fried parameter r _ 0 = 20 cm. With a DCR of 1000  cps, the satellite would need to pass almost directly over the OGS to see a reasonable secure key generation rate (that still reaches 5 · 10 ^ 4 bit per pass; however, passing at a horizontal distance of 500  km the secure key length after one pass would be zero bit). This is an order of magnitude lower than that reported in an early feasibility study carried out by Rarity and colleagues [36], mostly due to a more conservative and realistic estimate of the atmospheric link losses (an order of magnitude higher: nominally 45  dB versus 35  dB). We have subsequently investigated the effect of increasing the source brightness or decreasing the coincidence time window within still highly realistic limits. Settling on a source pair generation of 3 · 10 ^ 8 s^- 1 and a coincidence time window of 200  ps, both within easy technological reach, we have shown that a secure key rate of between 1.3 · 10 ^ 5 and 4.6 · 10 ^ 5 bits/pass (for, respectively, the distant and the direct overpass, and assuming that up to 300  s of the orbit can be effectively used for QKD) can be reached as long as the DCR of the detectors remain within a factor of ten of their initial DCR (i.e., < 250 cps), also after exposure to radiation in space. There is now growing evidence that Si-APDs, and in especially the thin junction, small diameter types such as we propose to use, will be able to operate in space with such low dark count rates up to one year or longer. Recent reports point towards deep cooling and/or laser annealing as probably successful mitigation strategies [41, 76]. With the shorter coincidence time window a DCR of 1000  cps per detector can be tolerated, yielding calculated secure key lengths of 9 · 10 ^ 4 and 4 · 10 ^ 5 bits for, respectively, the distant and direct overpasses (with r _ 0 = 20 cm). The calculated kHz secret key rates compare favorably to the several kHz sifted key rate demonstrated in the Micius downlink QKD experiment, especially considering its use of a 300 -mm diameter telescope on the satellite that results in an atmospheric link attenuation below 22  dB, and a decoy-state source [15].|$|E

40|$|Artículos en revistasA {{steady state}} {{security}} margin {{for a particular}} operating point {{can be defined as}} the distance from this initial point to the secure operating limits of the system. Four of the most used steady state security margins are the power flow feasibility <b>margin,</b> the <b>contingency</b> feasibility <b>margin,</b> the load margin to voltage collapse, and the total transfer capability between system areas. This is the second part of a two part paper. Part I has proposed a novel framework of a general model able to formulate, compute and improve any steady state security margin. In Part II the performance of the general model is validated by solving a variety of practical situations in modern real power systems. Actual examples of the Spanish power system will be used for this purpose. The same computation and improvement algorithms outlined in Part I have been applied for the four security margins considered in the study, outlining the convenience of defining a general framework valid for the four of them. The general model is used here in Part II to compute and improve: (a) the power flow feasibility margin (assessing the influence of the reactive power generation limits in the Spanish power system), (b) the <b>contingency</b> feasibility <b>margin</b> (assessing the influence of transmission and generation capacity in maintaining a correct voltage profile), (c) the load margin to voltage collapse (assessing the location and quantity of loads that must be shed in order to be far away from voltage collapse) and (d) the total transfer capability (assessing the export import pattern of electric power between different areas of the Spanish system). info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of bounds on voltage and thermal security margins with respect to <b>contingencies.</b> A <b>margin</b> is the maximal pre-contingency power transfer between either a generation and a load area or two generation areas, such that specirfied contingencies do not overload lines or make the system voltage unstable. The minimum and maximum margins are computed for given intervals of variations of bus injections. Each bound is the solution of a constrained L 1 -norm minimization (or maximization) problem, for which specific algorithms are given. Thermal overloads are handled through linearization, while for voltage stability, fast time simulation and instability mode analysis are used. Nonlinear situations of branch overload are also considered. The method is illustrated on an 80 -bus test system. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Recent, {{unprecedented}} {{increases in}} wind penetration pose new challenges to maintaining good control performance in power systems. The stochastic nature of wind power creates {{an incentive to}} treat control resources as stochastic. This work presents a stochastic, time-dependent model of contingency reserve (CR) activation {{that is based on}} system behavior expected by the NERC and WECC disturbance control performance standards. The model quantifies CR activation as a statistical combination of probability density functions (PDFs) that represent CR response deficiencies and generation outage probabilities. This work also formulates an algorithm for determining the CR response deficiency PDFs in real time from observed energy management system data. The proposed model has multiple applications such as a deterministic or stochastic unit commitment, system adequacy evaluation, <b>contingency</b> reserve <b>margins,</b> and <b>contingency</b> reserve allocation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{development}} of a dispatch/pricing model to examine the effect of maintaining voltage stability margins on spot prices, and also presents models for voltage stability constrained reactive power planning. We develop an AC OPF primal problem incorporating both multiple generator contingency constraints and multiple voltage stability <b>margin</b> <b>contingency</b> constraints. Active and reactive power trade off functions for the generators and the opportunity cost of foregoing active power generation to provide increased reactive power are considered. The objective is to minimise costs while maintaining the capability to deal with pre-defined contingency events. The dual of the primal problem is analysed to determine generation, reserve and demand price equations, which are examined to establish the effects on active and reactive power spot prices of generator contingency constraints and voltage stability <b>margin</b> <b>contingency</b> constraints. We also develop a voltage stability constrained and contingency constrained reactive power planning model. This uses a non-linear mixed integer programming algorithm to efficiently formulate and solve the VAR planning problem. Next, a statistical approximation procedure simplifying the voltage stability constrained planning model is presented. An equation of the locus of the PoCs is developed using statistical regression methods and used to simplify the full MINLP model. Finally, a preventive/corrective control model is developed to guard against voltage instability while taking into account the load-shed dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Artículos en revistasA {{steady state}} {{security}} margin {{for a particular}} operational point {{can be defined as}} the distance from this initial point to the secure operational limits of the system. Four of the most used steady state security margins are the power flow feasibility <b>margin,</b> the <b>contingency</b> feasibility <b>margin,</b> the load margin to voltage collapse, and the total transfer capability between system areas. A comprehensive literature survey has shown that these security margins have been studied separately. This fact has suggested to the authors the possibility of researching a common analysis framework valid for all of them. This is the first part of a two-part paper. In part I, a novel mathematical formulation valid to address the study of any steady state security margin is proposed. The developed general approach is presented in three steps: (a) formulation, (b) computation, and (c) improvement of security margins. In part II, the performance of the proposed approach when used to compute and improve the aforementioned steady security margins is illustrated through its application to the Spanish power system. Results denote that this approach can be a useful tool to solve a variety of practical situations in modern real power systems. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Mars Sample Return (MSR) is {{the highest}} {{priority}} science mission {{for the next decade}} as recommended by the recent Decadal Survey of Planetary Science. This paper presents an overview of a feasibility study for a MSR mission. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine whether emerging commercial capabilities can be used to reduce the number of mission systems and launches required to return the samples, with the goal of reducing mission cost. The major element required for the MSR mission are described and include an integration of the emerging commercial capabilities with small spacecraft design techniques; new utilizations of traditional aerospace technologies; and recent technological developments. We report the feasibility of a complete and closed MSR mission design using the following scenario that covers three synodic launch opportunities, beginning with the 2022 opportunity: A Falcon Heavy injects a SpaceX Red Dragon capsule and trunk onto a Trans Mars Injection (TMI) trajectory. The capsule is modified to carry all the hardware needed to return samples collected on Mars including a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV); an Earth Return Vehicle (ERV); and hardware to transfer a sample collected in a previously landed rover mission to the ERV. The Red Dragon descends to land on the surface of Mars using Supersonic Retro Propulsion (SRP). After previously collected samples are transferred to the ERV, the single-stage MAV launches the ERV from the surface of Mars to a Mars phasing orbit. The MAV uses a storable liquid, pump fed bi-propellant propulsion system. After a brief phasing period, the ERV, which also uses a storable bi-propellant system, performs a Trans Earth Injection (TEI) burn. Once near Earth the ERV performs Earth and lunar swing-bys and is placed into a Lunar Trailing Orbit (LTO 0 - an Earth orbit, at lunar distance. A later mission, using a Dragon and launched by a Falcon Heavy, performs a rendezvous with the ERV in the lunar trailing orbit, retrieves the sample container and breaks the chain of contact with Mars by transferring the sample into a sterile and secure container. With the sample contained, the retrieving spacecraft, makes a controlled Earth re-entry preventing any unintended release of pristine Martian materials into the Earth's biosphere. Other capsule type vehicles and associated launchers may be applicable. The analysis methods employed standard and specialized aerospace engineering tools. Mission system elements were analyzed with either direct techniques or by using parametric mass estimating relationships (MERs). The architecture was iterated until overall mission convergence was achieved on at least one path. Subsystems analyzed in this study include support structures, power system, nose fairing, thermal insulation, actuation devices, MAV exhaust venting, and GN&C. Best practice application of loads, mass growth <b>contingencies,</b> and resource <b>margins</b> were used. For Falcon Heavy capabilities and Dragon subsystems we utilized publically available data from SpaceX; published analyses from other sources; as well as our own engineering and aerodynamic estimates. Earth Launch mass is under 11 mt, which is within the estimated capability of a Falcon Heavy, with margin. Total entry masses between 7 and 10 mt were considered with closure occurring between 9 and 10 mt. Propellant mass fractions for each major phase of the EDL - Entry, Terminal Descent, and Hazard Avoidance - have been derived. An assessment of the entry conditions on the thermal protection system (TPS), currently in use for Dragon missions, has been made. And shows no significant stressors. A useful mass of 2. 0 mt is provided and includes mass growth allowances for the MAV, the ERV, and mission unique equipment. We also report on alternate propellant options for the MAV and options for the ERV, including propulsion systems; crewed versus robotic retrieval mission; as well as direct Earth entry. International Planetary Protection Policies as well as verifiable means of compliance will have a large impact on any MSR mission design. We identify areas within our architecture where such impacts occur. This work shows that emerging commercial capabilities can be used to effectively integrated into a mission to achieve an important planetary science objective...|$|R
