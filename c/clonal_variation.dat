The target cells were isolated from Epstein-Barr seronegative donors, and the same donor's cells could be studied repeatedly {{over long periods of}} time. When these cells were transformed by Epstein-Barr virus and had proliferated sufficiently to be studied, they had an average cloning efficiency of 3 %.

40|$|The {{last few}} years have seen a growing {{interest}} {{in the study of}} DNA methylation because of its now acknowledged implication in cancer. The use of bisulfite to convert unmethylated cytosine to uracil, even as methylated cytosine remains unchanged, constitutes the basis for differentiating between methylated and unmethylated specific CpG sites in CpG islands. This technique therefore is {{critical to the success of}} this approach. Different parameters have to be considered in order to achieve a total conversion of cytosines to uracils. Several bisulfite-based methods are available for analyzing DNA methylation status. Methylation-sensitive single-strand conformation analysis (MS-SSCA) yields specific and semiquantitative data. The method is based on bisulfite treatment of DNA followed by polymerase chain reaction using primers without a CpG site to avoid selective amplification of either methylated or unmethylated DNA, and finally by single-strand conformation analysis (SSCA). The method allows one to establish <b>clonal</b> <b>variations</b> in the DNA methylation status for clones representing as little as 5 - 10 % of the total cell population.

50|$|MDS, {{formerly}} known as preleukemia, are a group of bone marrow neoplastic diseases that share many of the morphologic features of AML, with some important differences. First, the percentage of undifferentiated progenitor cells, blast cells, is always less than 20%, and there is considerably more dysplasia, defined as cytoplasmic and nuclear morphologic changes in erythroid, granulocytic and megakaryocytic precursors, than what is usually seen in cases of AML. These changes reflect delayed apoptosis or a failure of programmed cell death. When left untreated, MDS can lead to AML in about 30% of cases. Due {{the nature of the}} FA pathology, MDS diagnosis cannot be made solely through cytogenetic analysis of the marrow. Indeed, it is only when morphologic analysis of marrow cells is performed, that a diagnosis of MDS can be ascertained. Upon examination, MDS-afflicted FA patients will show many <b>clonal</b> <b>variations,</b> appearing either prior or subsequent to the MDS. Furthermore, cells will show chromosomal aberrations, the most frequent being monosomy 7 and partial trisomies of chromosome 3q 15. Observation of monosomy 7 within the marrow is well correlated with an increased risk of developing AML and with a very poor prognosis, death generally ensuing within 2 years (unless prompt allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant is an option).|$|R

Shell height, shell diameter, aperture diameter and collar height did not differ significantly between the two morphotypes. The number of conical spines varies from 0 to 8. However, the distribution of spine numbers showed two main modes at 0 (spineless form 45. 1 % of individuals) and 4 - 6 (38. 9 %), suggesting the possible existence of two genetically distinct lineages. Spines may have ecological and evolutionary significance. Our results suggested that the spiny and spineless morphotypes of D. tuberspinifera represent either a single variable taxon with different ecotypes or sibling species.

The nib 1 mutation replaces conserved tryptophan 490 with leucine in the protease domain of Ulp 1. Complete deletion of ULP 1 is lethal, even in a strain that lacks the 2 μm circle.

While the development of subpopulations of isogenic cells in bioprocesses is well described (intra-population variability), a possible variability between genetically identical cultures growing under macroscopically identical conditions (clonal variability) is not. A high such clonal variability has been found for the recombinant expression of the styrene monooxygenase genes styAB from Pseudomonas taiwanensis VLB 120 in solvent-tolerant Pseudomonas putida DOT-T 1 E using the alk-regulatory system from P. putida GPo 1. In this study, the oxygenase subunit StyA fused to eGFP was used as readout tool to characterize the population structure in P. putida DOT-T 1 E regarding recombinant protein content. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that in individual cultures, at least two subpopulations with highly differing recombinant StyA-eGFP protein contents appeared (intra-population variability). Interestingly, subpopulation sizes varied from culture-to-culture correlating with the specific styrene epoxidation activity of cells derived from respective cultures (clonal variability).

BAP <b>clonal</b> <b>variation</b> is characterized by an alternation between a Bap+ and Bap- phenotype. The switching is regulated by the phoM operon {{and the presence of}} glucose; the pho- 510 mutant form of the phoM operon abolishes both BAP <b>clonal</b> <b>variation</b> and the effect of glucose (B. L. Wanner, J. Bacteriol. 169 : 900 - 903, 1987). In this paper we show that a mutation of the adenyl cyclase (cya) and the cyclic AMP receptor protein (crp) gene also abolish BAP clonal variation; either simultaneously reduces the amount of BAP made in phoR mutants. Also, the pho- 510 mutation is epistatic; it increases BAP synthesis in delta cya phoR and delta crp phoR mutants. These data are consistent with the wild-type phoM operon having a negative, as well as a positive, regulatory role in gene expression. Furthermore, the data suggest that adenyl cyclase and Crp indirectly regulate BAP synthesis in a phoR mutant via an interaction with the phoM operon or its gene products. However, phoM operon expression was unaffected when tested with phoM operon lacZ transcriptional fusions.

The present experiments, using a cell-free protein-synthesizing system from wheat germ; show that albumin messenger RNA activity is directly proportional to the rate of albumin synthesis in three different hepatoma clones, thus suggesting a pretranslational control of albumin production.

Telomere length, telomerase activity, and chromosome instability were measured in multiple clones isolated from three related human B-lymphoblast cell lines that vary in TP 53 expression; TK 6 cells express wild-type TP 53, WTK 1 cells overexpress a mutant form of TP 53, and NH 32 cells express no TP 53 protein. <b>Clonal</b> <b>variations</b> in both telomere length and chromosome stability were observed, and shorter telomeres were associated with higher levels of chromosome instability. The shortest telomeres were found in WTK 1 - and NH 32 -derived cells, and these cells had 5 - to 10 -fold higher levels of chromosome instability. The primary marker of instability was the presence of dicentric chromosomes. Aneuploidy and other stable chromosome alterations were also found in clones showing high levels of dicentrics. Polyploidy was found only in WTK 1 -derived cells. Both telomere length and chromosome instability fluctuated in the different cell populations with time in culture, presumably as unstable cells and cells with short telomeres were eliminated from the growing population.

Two hundred sixteen trees from nine clones were sampled in the four sites. • Results Site had a highly significant (P[*]<[*] 0. 001) effect on extractives and tree growth and a moderate effect on lignin and holocellulose. Clonal effects were also significant (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) for all studied traits. Clone[*]×[*]site interactions were significant for all studied traits except for holocellulose. No significant estimated correlations between chemical properties of wood and growth traits were observed. However, a weak and negative estimated correlation between lignin and growth traits existed. This suggests that selection for growth traits might lead to a minor reduction in lignin in triploid breeding of P. tomentosa. • Conclusions Our results revealed that chemical properties of wood were under stronger genetic control than growth traits in triploid hybrid clones of P. tomentosa.

40|$|The Py 235 {{merozoite}} rhoptry protein of the rodent malaria agent Plasmodium (yoelii) yoeli is encoded by the Py 235 {{multigene family}} {{whose members are}} transcribed during the parasite's asexual life-cycle in a fashion where single schizonts subsequently give rise to sets of merozoites containing distinct Py 235 transcripts. Homologues of Py 235 are found in other malaria species, and antibodies to both Py 235 and P. falciparum homologues inhibit merozoite invasion, suggesting a unique survival strategy involving immune evasion and host adaptation. Using a mathematical approach to model this free-living stage of Plasmodium in interaction with specific antibodies and a heterogeneous red blood cell population, we investigate if, and under what conditions, this mechanism of <b>clonal</b> phenotypic <b>variation</b> {{can play a role}} in immune evasion and adaptation to a dynamic erythropoietic environment...|$|R
