5|$|Most of Kassandra's {{family has}} <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her as mad, and become angry when she feels {{compelled}} to vocalize prophecies that foretell the end of Troy. Despite Kassandra's warnings, the city experiences an earthquake sent by Poseidon, killing the three young sons of Helen and Paris. After Patroklus is killed by Hector, his closest friend Akhilles again joins the fight to get his revenge. Hector {{and his younger brother}} Troilus are killed, to the grief of everyone in Troy. Akhilles kills Penthesilea in battle, and soon after Kassandra fires a fatally poisoned arrow at his unprotected heel.|$|E
25|$|By the 1940s, when Tolkien {{began writing}} The Lord of the Rings, he had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Balrog as Noldorin balch 'cruel' + rhaug 'demon', with a Quenya {{equivalent}} Malarauko (from nwalya- 'to torture' + rauko 'demon').|$|E
500|$|The Parliamentary {{leader of}} the {{opposition}} Labour party, Harold Wilson, attacked the new Prime Minister as [...] "an elegant anachronism". He asserted that nobody from Douglas-Home's background knew of the problems of ordinary families. In particular, Wilson demanded to know how [...] "a scion of an effete establishment" [...] could lead the technological revolution that Wilson held to be necessary: [...] "This is the counter-revolution... After half a century of democratic advance, of social revolution, the whole process has ground to a halt with a fourteenth earl!" [...] Douglas-Home pooh-poohed this as inverted snobbery, and observed, [...] "I suppose Mr Wilson, when you <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it, is the fourteenth Mr Wilson." [...] He called Wilson [...] "this slick salesman of synthetic science" [...] and the Labour party [...] "the only relic of class consciousness in the country". The opposition retreated, with a statement in the press that [...] "The Labour Party is not interested {{in the fact that the}} new Prime Minister inherited a fourteenth Earldom– he cannot help his antecedents any more than the rest of us." ...|$|E

500|$|Bo's {{first wife}} was Li Danyu, the {{daughter}} of former Beijing Party First Secretary Li Xuefeng. They wed in September 1976 and had a son, [...] "Brendan" [...] Li Wangzhi (李望知), the following year. Their son graduated from Columbia University in 2001. Li Danyu insisted that her son change his surname to Li following her divorce from Bo Xilai in 1984. Li Wangzhi was reportedly low-key and modest and was not commonly associated with his father during the latter's political heyday. Li Wangzhi obtained a master's degree in media studies and worked {{for a few years}} at Citibank, then worked for a law firm in Beijing; he eventually went into private equity. Li had remarked publicly that his father's arrest [...] "destroyed his life". In 2014, Li released a statement on his microblog feed revealing that his father was doing well in prison and that medical treatment is available to him should he need it. Li wrote, [...] "life is short... if the law allows, I would like to see him more. <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it, the only times I've seen him [...] was at funerals, in the courtroom, or in prison." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "You {{can even}} say the Samsung {{chairman}} {{is more powerful}} than the President of South Korea. [...] Korean people have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Samsung as invincible and above the law", said Woo Suk-hoon, host of a popular economics podcast in a Washington Post article headlined [...] "In South Korea, the Republic of Samsung", published on 9 December 2012. Critics claimed that Samsung knocked out smaller businesses, limiting choices for South Korean consumers, and sometimes colluded with fellow giants to fix prices while bullying those who investigate. Lee Jung-hee, a South Korean presidential candidate, said in a debate, [...] "Samsung has the government in its hands. Samsung manages the legal world, the press, the academics and bureaucracy".|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Maxime Rodinson, a {{distinguished}} Marxist scholar of Islam, responded to French avant-garde enthusiasm for Khomeini's revolution in a three part article in Le Monde, by arguing that, {{in response to}} successive assaults by Crusaders, Mongols, Turks and Western imperialism, [...] Islamic countries had come to feel embattled, and the impoverished masses had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> their elites, linked to foreigners, as devoid of traditional piety. Both nationalism and socialism imported from the West were recast in religious terms, {{in a process of}} political Islamicization which would be devoid of the progressive side of nationalism and revert to what he called [...] "a type of archaic fascism" [...] characterized by policing the state to enforce a totalitarian moral and social order.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1993, Massachusetts Institute of Technology {{linguistics}} {{professor and}} political commentator Noam Chomsky praised the film {{because of the}} way people were portrayed doing the real work of unions. According to Chomsky: [...] "he real work is being done by people who are not known, that's always been true in every popular movement in history...I don't know how you get that across in a film. Actually, <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it, there are some films that have done it. I mean, I don't see a lot of visual stuff, so I'm not the best commentator, but I thought Salt of the Earth really did it. It was a long time ago, but at the time I thought {{that it was one of}} the really great movies—and of course it was killed, I think it was almost never shown." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1960, the DOB {{held their}} first {{convention}} in San Francisco, {{which was so}} successful that they held one every two years until 1968. Press releases announcing the convention were sent to local radio and newspapers, prompting the San Francisco Chronicle to direct a jab at Russell Wolden and publicize the convention when Herb Caen wrote, [...] "Russ Wolden, if no one else, will be interested {{to learn that the}} Daughters of Bilitis will hold their nat'l convention here May 27–30. They're the female counterparts of the Mattachine Society — and one of the convention highlights will be an address by Atty. Morris Lowenthal titled, 'The Gay Bar in the Courts.' Oh brother.

2500|$|Ozu {{told me to}} come [...] in {{the room}} [...] and circle around. So I did as I was told, but of course it wasn’t good enough. After the third take, Ozu {{approved}} it… The reason [...] circles around the room once is that she’s nostalgic for all the memories there and she also wants to make sure she’s left nothing behind. He didn’t show each of these things explicitly, but through my smoothly circling the room—through how I moved, through the pacing and the blocking—I think that’s {{what he was trying to}} express. At the time, I didn’t understand. I remember I did it rhythmically: I didn’t walk and I didn’t run; I just moved lightly and rhythmically. As I continued doing it, that’s what it turned into, and Ozu okayed it. <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it, it was that way of walking rhythmically that I think was good. I did it naturally, not deliberately. And of course it was Ozu who helped me do it.|$|E
