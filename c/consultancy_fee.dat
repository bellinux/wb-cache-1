40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} non-audit services <b>fees</b> (<b>consultancy</b> <b>fees)</b> paid to auditors and (1) audit fees, and (2) the occurrence of qualified audit opinions. The positive association between <b>consultancy</b> <b>fees</b> and audit fees is shown {{to be due to}} certain company specific events that generate a demand for consultancy services as well as requiring additional audit effort. Identified company specific events are mergers and acquisitions, new share issues, new accounting and information systems, new CEOs, and corporate restructurings. When these events are absent, there is no statistically significant relationship between audit <b>fees</b> and <b>consultancy</b> <b>fees</b> after controlling for company size. Companies that have relatively high <b>consultancy</b> <b>fees</b> are more likely to receive a clean audit opinion. This {{may be due to the}} non-audit work clearing up problem areas at the client company or it may be due to high <b>consultancy</b> <b>fees</b> impairing auditor independence. With the available data it is not possible to distinguish between these two reasons. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2002. ...|$|R

5000|$|Kozhikode Light Metro is a {{proposed}} mass rapid transport system (MRTS) {{for the city}} of Kozhikode (Calicut), in India. In 2010, the State government explored the possibility of implementing a metro rail project for Kozhikode city and its suburbs. The proposal was to have a corridor connecting the Karipur Airport to the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital through the heart of the city. An inception report was submitted by a Bangalore-based consultant, Wilber Smith, on the detailed feasibility study on the prospect of implementing the Mass Rapid Transport System (MRTS) and Light Rail Transit System (LRTS) in the city. However, the project has been scrapped to be replaced by Kozhikode Monorail project. The State Cabinet then decided to form a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to implement monorail projects in Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram, and administrative sanction was given in October 2012. The state government issued orders entrusting the Thiruvananthapuram Monorail project to the KMCL on 26 November 2012. The government had handed over the Kozhikode Monorail project to the KMCL prior to that. On 12 June 2013, the State Cabinet gave clearance for an agreement to be signed between KMCL and DMRC, that would make the latter the general consultant for the monorail projects in Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram. The DMRC will receive a <b>consultancy</b> <b>fee</b> of 3.25% of the [...] 55.81 billion ( [...] 35.90 billion for Thiruvananthapuram and [...] 19.91 billion for Kozhikode). The agreement was signed on 19 June 2013. However, due to cost overrun and the cold response from the bidders the project was put on hold. Bombardier Transportation was the only bidder for the project. The project was later scrapped and Light metro was proposed.|$|E

Figures of savings made for the client by the consultants from both the pre-contract estimates and the various contractors’ variation claims were collated and analyzed.

40|$|A Research project {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Science in Actuarial Science at Strathmore UniversityKenya has witnessed a steep rise {{in the cost of}} healthcare since January 2008 (Nduati, 201 O) says Mr. Peter Nduati, {{the chief executive officer of}} Resolution Health East Africa, a medical insurance provider. The cost of healthcare in the country has been increasing by 10 to 20 per cent annually in the last 10 years, as per the research by Smart Company. Over the period, the <b>consultancy</b> <b>fee</b> in various hospitals has risen from Sh 800 to Sh 2, 000, which is a 150 per cent increase. The cost of simple painkillers have gone up by up to 28 per cent as of recently. In the three years preceding. September 2010, medical costs in Kenya were reported to have risen by an average of 20 % per annum, more than any other country on the continent. This was largely attributed to the steep rise in doctor's fees, thanks to the collapse of the pricing guidelines fronted by the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board. Consultation fees for general practitioners tripled within the same period while specialists such as gynecologists and oncologists were charging up to Ksh. 10, 000 before diagnosis (Yumbya, 2010). For a country grappling with high inflation and perennial increase in prices of medicines, the need for health insurance needs little emphasis. (Liss, 2014...|$|E
