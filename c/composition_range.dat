5|$|Level Mountain has {{experienced}} volcanic eruptions sporadically {{for the last}} 15 million years, making it the most persistent volcano of the NCVP. More than 20 eruptive centres are present on the summit and flanks of the massif. These have produced mainly felsic and mafic lavas, a chemical <b>composition</b> <b>range</b> typical of bimodal volcanism. Such volcanism commonly occurs at hotspots, continental rifts and leaky transform faults. The existence of olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel xenocrysts in Level Mountain basalt suggest that volcanism at the massif originated from the upper mantle. Hiatuses of up to a million years or more can be expected between periods of volcanic activity at Level Mountain.|$|E

2500|$|Volcanism 22to 21million {{years ago}} {{constructed}} the Coquihalla Volcanic Complex about [...] northeast of Hope. It comprises volcanic and intrusive rocks that are calc-alkaline felsic to intermediate in composition. Coquihalla Mountain, the highest {{summit of the}} Bedded Range with an elevation of , is a major preserved stratovolcano and {{represents one of the}} few remaining Miocene volcanoes in southwestern British Columbia. As a result, the Coquihalla Volcanic Complex has been a subject of geological studies to annunciate the remains of what might have been an extensive cover of volcanic rocks during the early Miocene epoch. The Coquihalla Complex also has a different igneous composition than Canadian Cascade Arc volcanoes that formed in the last two million years. Rhyolite tuffs are the primary igneous rocks comprising the Coquihalla Volcanic Complex, with small amounts of basalt or andesite present. This contrasts with modern Canadian Cascade volcanoes in that they are mainly composed of volcanic rocks in the basalt to andesite <b>composition</b> <b>range,</b> with few rocks of more felsic composition than dacite. Changes in magma composition have also occurred in the American portion of the Cascade Arc.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of glass research it was most important to know {{the relation between the}} glass composition and its properties. For this purpose Otto Schott introduced the additivity principle in several publications for calculation of glass properties. This principle implies that the relation between the glass composition and a specific property is linear to all glass component concentrations, assuming an ideal mixture, with Ci and bi representing specific glass component concentrations and related coefficients respectively in the equation below. The additivity principle is a simplification and only valid within narrow composition ranges as seen in the displayed diagrams for the refractive index and the viscosity. Nevertheless, the application of the additivity principle lead the way to many of Schott’s inventions, including optical glasses, glasses with low thermal expansion for cooking and laboratory ware (Duran), and glasses with reduced freezing point depression for mercury thermometers. Subsequently, English and Gehlhoff et al. published similar additive glass property calculation models. Schott’s additivity principle is still widely in use today in glass research and technology.-Al2O3-Na2O-K2O-CaO-MgO in the <b>composition</b> <b>range</b> of technical glasses |journal=Glass Technology |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=88–95 |date=June 1972 }} ...|$|E
