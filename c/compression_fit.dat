40|$|Most {{compression}} {{algorithms used}} in storage systems today {{are based on}} an increasingly outmoded sequential processing model. Systems wishing to decompress blocksout-of-orderorinparallelmustresetthecompressor’s state before each block, reducing adaptiveness and limitingcompressionratios. Toremedythissituation,we present Non-Linear Compression, a novel compression model enabling systems to impose an arbitrary partial order on inter-block dependencies. Mutually unordered blocks may be compressed and decompressed out-oforder or in parallel, and a compressor can adaptively compress each block based on all causally prior blocks. This graph structure captures the system’s data dependenciesexplicitlyandcompletely,enablingthecompressor to adapt using long-lived state without the constraint of sequential processing. Preliminary experiences with a simple Huffman compressor suggest that non-linear <b>compression</b> <b>fits</b> adiverse set of storageapplications. ...|$|R

The postoperative edema compromises the functional follow-up treatment. Based on the good experience with <b>fitted</b> <b>compression</b> treatment of the lower extremities, the beneficial effects of this treatment in reduction of swelling and therefore a quicker restoration of function after surgical treatment of distal radius fractures were investigated. Materials and Methods: Based on a preliminary exam in a prospective randomized study with 60 patients occurring an isolated distal radius fracture the effect of <b>fitted</b> <b>compression</b> gloves compared to elastic bandage therapy in the postoperative functional treatment was analyzed. Results: The 57 included patients showed a statistically significant quicker volume reduction in the compression glove group.

40|$|International audienceGiven that {{real-time}} {{systems are}} specified {{to a degree}} of confidence, budget overruns {{should be expected to}} occur in a system at some point. When a budget overrun occurs, it is necessary to understand how long such a state persists, in order to determine if the fault tolerance of the system is adequate to handle the problem. However, given the rarity of budget overruns in testing, it cannot be assumed that sufficient data will be available to build an accurate model. Hence this paper presents a new application of Markov Chain based modelling techniques combined with forecasting techniques to determine an appropriate fault model, using Lossy <b>Compression</b> to <b>fit</b> the model to the available data.

40|$|As part of {{an ongoing}} investigation, the {{influence}} of in-cylinder charge density, and injector nozzle geometry on the behavior of diesel sprays were examined using high-speed imaging. Both liquid and vapor penetration profiles were investigated in operating conditions representative of a modern turbocharged after-cooled HSDI diesel engine.

Differences in spray liquid and vapor penetrations were observed for different nozzle geometries and in-cylinder conditions over a range of injection fuelling representative of those in a typical engine map. Investigation into the differences in spray structure formed by multi-hole and single-hole injections were also undertaken. The results of the spray penetration profiles from the experiments were compared to empirical correlations in the literature and differences observed were attributed to flow structures within the nozzle, which are not taken into account by these correlations. ...|$|R

40|$|The article Measuring the Hubble {{constant}} by Mario Livio and Adam Riess (Physics Today, October 2013, page 41) reviewed {{studies of}} the expanding universe from the 1920 s to the present.

We therefore offer the following clarifications. Most significantly, papers by Arthur Eddington and by Willem de Sitter in 1930, who successfully promoted Georges Lematres 1927 article for the Scientific Society of Brussels, effected a paradigm shift in interpretation of extragalactic redshifts in 1930. Before then, the astronomical community was generally unaware of the existence of nonstatic cosmological solutions and did not broadly appreciate that redshifts could be thought of locally as Doppler shifts in an expanding matter distribution. Certainly, in 1929 Edwin Hubble referred only to the de Sitter solution of 1917. At the time, the relation between distance and redshift predicted in that model was generally seen purely as a manifestation of static spacetime curvature...|$|R

We {{present a}} {{technique}} for answering queries over RDF data through an evolutionary search algorithm, using fingerprinting and Bloom filters for rapid approximate evaluation of generated solutions.

Secondly, through Bloom filter <b>compression</b> we can <b>fit</b> large graphs in main memory, reducing the need for disk I/O during query evaluation. Finally, since the individuals evolve independently, parallel execution is straightforward. We present our prototype that evaluates basic SPARQL queries over arbitrary RDF graphs and show initial results over large datasets. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} material {{models for}} a porous, polymeric scaffold used for bone. The material {{was made by}} co-extruding poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL), a biodegradable polyester, and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). The water soluble PEO was removed resulting in a porous scaffold. The stress-strain curve in <b>compression</b> was <b>fit</b> with a phenomenological model in hyperbolic form. This material model will be useful for designers for quasi-static analysis as it provides a simple form that can easily be used in finite element models. The ASTM D- 1621 standard recommends using a secant modulus based on 10 % strain. The resulting modulus has a smaller scatter in its value compared to the coefficients of the hyperbolic model, and it is therefore easier to compare material processing differences and ensure quality of the scaffold. A third material model was constructed from images of the microstructure. Each pixel of the micrographs was represented with a brick finite element and assigned the Young’s modulus of bulk PCL or a value of 0 for a pore. A compressive strain was imposed on the model and the resulting stresses were calculated. The elastic constants of the scaffold were then computed using Hooke’s law for a linear-elastic isotropic material. The model was able to predict the small strain Young’s modulus measured in the experiments to within one standard deviation. Thus, by knowing the microstructure of the scaffold, its bulk properties can be predicted from the material properties of the constituents...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — As shape {{parameterization}} {{defines the}} design variables for the optimization of some object (geometric knowledge representation), {{it is very}} important to apply parameterizations with a low number of control points in order to reduce the dimensionality of the search space. A parameterization for 2 D and 3 D geometries based on piecewise Bezier curves and surfaces is proposed here. The requested C 1 inter- segment continuity is accomplished by automatically generating additional control points without increasing the number of optimization variables. The computational procedure takes the initially given complex surface or points cloud (2 D or 3 D), adaptively splits the domain into 2 D or 3 D patches and iteratively tries to reduce the necessary number of control points while satisfying the requested modeling accuracy. This adaptive parameterization procedure can serve as a geometric data-set <b>compression</b> utility and <b>fits</b> well into evolutionary optimization.
