The ±450kV high-voltage direct <b>current</b> <b>line</b> in Hydro-Québec's power grid uses a T-shaped tower, lattice or pole, to support two bundles of three conductors on each side. The direct current power line sometimes uses two poles or a wider, pyramidal, self-supporting lattice structure for angle towers.|$|E

50|$|A {{traction}} current pylon is a railroad pylon carrying {{at least one}} circuit for {{traction current}}. In Germany, traction <b>current</b> <b>lines</b> with two systems (4 conductor cables) typically have a single level arrangement of the conductor cables. For traction <b>current</b> <b>lines</b> with four systems (8 conductor cables), the two-level arrangement (4 conductor cables on each crossbar) is frequently used, except for traction <b>current</b> <b>lines</b> supplying high-speed railway lines are used. For these lines a three-level arrangement is used, in which the lowest cross bar has four conductor cables {{and each of the}} two highest cross bars have two conductor cables. The three-level arrangement is also used for traction current pylons with 6 electric circuits (12 conductor cables). For the supply of rapid-transit railways operated with alternating <b>current,</b> some overhead <b>line</b> pylons have cross bars for traction <b>current</b> <b>lines</b> above the contact wire. Other pylons carry electric circuits for traction current and also for three-phase alternating current.|$|R

5|$|The <b>current</b> <b>line</b> {{scheme of}} the R1 started {{operating}} on , after {{the dismantling of}} the former route of the Barcelona–Mataró–Maçanet-Massanes railway through the Barcelona neighborhood of Poblenou. Earlier, all the commuter rail services coming from Mataró used the route through Poblenou, terminating at Estació de les Rodalies, a terminus station that was located adjacent to the still existing Estació de França. All services coming from Mataró were then rerouted through the Sagrera rail complex and the Meridiana Tunnel to access Barcelona, terminating at L'Hospitalet de Llobregat or Barcelona–El Prat Airport stations, depending on the station of origin. The services coming from Mataró terminated at the airport, whilst the services coming from north of Mataró terminated at L'Hospitalet de Llobregat. Since the new through line scheme offered more stops within Barcelona and better connections with the city's metro system, the line's ridership doubled. Throughout 1989, this new line scheme was incorporated as part of line 1 of Rodalies Barcelona (predecessor of the R1), the Cercanías commuter rail system for the Barcelona area, created in the same year.|$|E

50|$|Traction <b>current</b> <b>lines</b> are {{operated}} symmetrically against earth. In {{the case}} of 110 kV lines, for example, each conductor has a voltage of 55 kV against earth. The grounding is made in larger substations and in power stations for traction current, using transformers for the cancellation of the earth leakage current. As {{is the case for}} all symmetrical powerlines there are also at traction power lines twisting points. A traction powerline for one circuit has usually two conductors. Since most traction <b>current</b> <b>lines</b> possess two electric circuits, four conductors are on the pylons as a rule (in contrast with three-phase alternating <b>current</b> <b>lines,</b> whose number of conductors are an integral multiple of three).|$|R

Lines 2 and 3, built by Attiko Metro and operated until 2011 by Attiko Metro Operations Company, are known respectively as the red and blue lines and were inaugurated in January 2000.

The overall service frequency reduces as the line gets closer to central Barcelona, where the core route between Pl. Catalunya and Gràcia stations provides a headway of less than 2 minutes in each direction during rush hours. Thus, with up to 32 trains per hour in each direction, the Pl. Catalunya–Gràcia section of the Barcelona–Vallès Line is one of Europe's busiest commuter rail lines by number of operations together with RER line A in Paris or portions of the Berlin S-Bahn.|$|E

40|$|Magnetic {{nanoparticles}} (MNPs) {{are increasingly}} being used as ‘magnetic labels’ in medical diagnostics. Practical applications of MNPs necessitate reducing their non-specific interactions with sensor surfaces that result in noise in measurements. Here we describe the design and implementation of a sensing platform that incorporates circular shaped <b>current</b> <b>lines</b> that reduce non-specific binding by enabling the “magnetic washing” of loosely attached MNPs attached to the senor surface. Generating magnetic fields by passing electrical currents through the circular shaped <b>current</b> <b>lines</b> enabled the capture and collection of fluorescent MNPs that was more efficient and effective than straight <b>current</b> <b>lines</b> reported to-date. The use of fluorescent MNPs allows their optical detection rather than with widely used magnetoresistive sensors. As a result our approach is not affected by magnetic noise due to the flow of currents. Our design is expected to improve the speed, accuracy, and sensitivity of MNPs based medical diagnostics...|$|R
