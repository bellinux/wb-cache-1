Due to the predominance of cyanobacteria in this lake, we hypothesized that bacterial <b>carbon</b> <b>flow</b> to grazers would be larger than phytoplankton <b>carbon</b> <b>flow</b> to grazers. Using epifluorescent and light microscopy and radiotracer techniques, we measured the carbon biomass of planktonic functional groups and <b>carbon</b> <b>flow</b> between these groups.

Microphytoplankton dominated the carbon biomass of all plankton, whereas the calanoid copepod, Diaptomus, dominated the carbon biomass of the grazers.

40|$|Intense {{disturbance}} may locally destroy {{patches of}} habitat and shape the landscape into {{a mosaic of}} reassembling communities. The development of ecosystem properties during such community reassembly is poorly understood. In intertidal bare sediments, trophic relations between microphytobenthos or heterotrophic bacteria and macrofauna invertebrates may guarantee fundamental ecosystem properties such as <b>carbon</b> <b>flow</b> through the food web. We studied the dynamic relation between reassembling macrofauna communities and such microbial <b>carbon</b> <b>flow</b> during recovery after severe disturbance. We deliberately induced prolonged hypoxia in winter and early summer and allowed recolonisation for periods of two and five months. <b>Carbon</b> <b>flow</b> was quantified from basal resources (microphytobenthos and bacteria) to intermediate consumers using 13 C as a tracer. Within the period of study (5 months), microbial <b>carbon</b> <b>flow</b> fully recovered, although macrofauna diversity was still very low compared to the natural communities (ranging from 6 to 17 species). More than 90 % of microbial <b>carbon</b> <b>flow</b> to macrofauna {{was due to the}} consumers that recolonised within two months. Two of these species were dominant contributors to microphytobenthos carbon transfer to fauna. Furthermore, at an early stage of reassembly, this ecosystem property was remarkably similar when disturbance took place at different times of the year (winter or early summer), although there were differences in assemblage composition and functional diversity. We conclude that species assemblages and ecosystem function developed relatively independently in this benthic system.

40|$|Previous results {{indicated}} poor sugar consumption and early inhibition of metabolism and growth when Clostridium cellulolyticum was cultured on medium containing cellobiose and yeast extract. Changing from complex medium to a synthetic medium {{had a strong}} effect on (i) the specific cellobiose consumption, which was increased threefold; and (ii) the electron flow, since the NADH/NAD+ ratios ranged from 0. 29 to 2. 08 on synthetic medium whereas ratios as high as 42 to 57 on complex medium were observed. These data indicate a better control of the <b>carbon</b> <b>flow</b> on mineral salts medium than on complex medium. By continuous culture, it was shown that the electron flow from glycolysis was balanced by the production of hydrogen gas, ethanol, and lactate. At low levels of <b>carbon</b> <b>flow,</b> pyruvate was preferentially cleaved to acetate and ethanol, enabling the bacteria to maximize ATP formation. A high catabolic rate led to pyruvate overflow and to increased ethanol and lactate production. In vitro, glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, and ethanol dehydrogenase levels were higher under conditions giving higher in vivo specific production rates. Redox balance is essentially maintained by NADH-ferredoxin reductase-hydrogenase at low levels of <b>carbon</b> <b>flow</b> and by ethanol dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase at high levels of <b>carbon</b> <b>flow.</b> The same maximum growth rate (0. 150 h− 1) was found in both mineral salts and complex media, proving that the uptake of nutrients or the generation of biosynthetic precursors occurred faster than their utilization. On synthetic medium, cellobiose carbon was converted into cell mass and catabolized to produce ATP, while on complex medium, it served mainly as an energy supply and, if present in excess, led to an accumulation of intracellular metabolites as demonstrated for NADH.

In vivo assays with transcriptional lacZ fusions showed that FruR controls the expression of FruR operator-containing genes encoding key enzymes of virtually every major pathway of carbon metabolism. Moreover, a fruR null mutation altered the rates of utilization of at least 36 carbon sources.
