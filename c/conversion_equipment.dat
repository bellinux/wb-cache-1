40|$|International audienceA {{great deal}} of {{interest}} {{has been paid to}} induction machine control over the last years. However, most previous works have focused on the speed/flux/torque regulation supposing the machine magnetic circuit to be linear and ignoring the machine power <b>conversion</b> <b>equipments.</b> The point is that speed regulation cannot be ensured in optimal efficiency conditions, {{for a wide range of}} speed-set-point and load torque, unless the magnetic circuit nonlinearity is explicitly accounted for in the motor model. On the other hand, the negligence of the power <b>conversion</b> <b>equipments</b> makes it impossible to deal properly with the harmonic pollution issue due to 'motor - power supply grid' interaction. This paper presents a theoretical framework for a global control strategy of the induction machine and related power equipments. The proposed strategy involves a multi-loop nonlinear adaptive controller designed to meet the three main control objectives, i. e. tight speed regulation for a wide range speed-reference variation, flux optimization for energy consumption and power factor correction (PFC). Tools from the averaging theory are resorted to formally describe the control performances...|$|R

2500|$|The {{tendency}} of N2O4 to reversibly break into NO2 {{has led to}} research into its use in advanced power generation systems as a so-called dissociating gas. [...] "Cool" [...] dinitrogen tetroxide is compressed and heated, causing it to dissociate into nitrogen dioxide at half the molecular weight. [...] This hot nitrogen dioxide is expanded through a turbine, cooling it and lowering the pressure, and then cooled further in a heat sink, causing it to recombine into nitrogen tetroxide at the original molecular weight. [...] It is then much easier to compress to start the entire cycle again. [...] Such dissociative gas Brayton cycles {{have the potential to}} considerably increase efficiencies of power <b>conversion</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The working {{principle}} of a self-centering, power-driven and external-clamping device is induced. The device {{is based on}} self-locking worm and worm wheel and slot-and-crank drive. Its mechanical properties and calculation formula is also given out. After the device being driven by gear motor, output torque rotates the driving and driven gears first, and then transmits the driving force to the upper and the lower worms; Then the upper and the lower worms rotate their meshing worm gears separately and the worm gears sway the upper and the lower crank-connecting rods articulated in worm gears; Lastly, three times amplification of the force is realized by the force-amplifier of the upper and the lower crank connecting rods. The device can center automatically {{up and down and}} clamps the workpiece. Besides, the device is with less energy <b>conversion</b> <b>equipments,</b> compact structure, well flexibility and high greenization.

50|$|Turbines {{are to be}} {{deployed}} in arrays of multiple units spaced no less than 15 m apart where the site conditions, depth, and needed infrastructure are suitable. Exact depth and spacing is determined based on site conditions, including current flows and water depth.

This entire structure is installed at a depth that avoids any interference with recreational or navigational uses of a water resource. The power will be transmitted by cable to <b>conversion</b> <b>equipment</b> located on shore. The <b>conversion</b> <b>equipment</b> will convert the power from DC to AC, adjust the voltage and connect to the power grid.
