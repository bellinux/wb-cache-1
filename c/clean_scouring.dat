60|$|We {{first visited}} the lodging house for single men in Charles Street, Drury Lane. This {{was one of}} the first {{experiments}} made in this line, and to effect the thing in the most economical manner possible, three old houses were bought and thrown into one, and fitted up for the purpose. On the ground floor we saw the superintendent's apartment, and a large, long sitting room, furnished with benches and <b>clean,</b> <b>scoured</b> tables, where the inmates were, some of them, reading books or papers: the day being wet, perhaps, kept them from their work. In the kitchen were ample cooking accommodations, and each inmate, as I understand, cooks for himself. Lord Shaftesbury said, that--something like a common table had been tried, but that it was found altogether easier or more satisfactory for each one to suit himself. On this floor, also, was a bathing room, and a well-selected library of useful reading books, history, travels, &c. On the next floor were the dormitories--a great hall divided by board partitions into little sleeping cells about eight feet square, each containing a neat bed, chair, and stand. The partition does not extend quite up to the wall, and by this means while each inmate enjoys the privacy of a small room, he has all the comfort of breathing the air of the whole hall.|$|R
40|$|The wool {{production}} and fleece analysis of 50 extremely plainbodied stud ewes are given. The ewes were {{typical of the}} sheep of the stud (including the stud rams) and were obtained from a breeder who had consistently bred for extreme plainness, so that this characteristic is successfully being transmitted to the progeny. Thirty-five four-toothed stud ewes, recorded in 1940, gave an average greasy fleece of 13 • 28 lb.; a <b>clean</b> <b>scoured</b> fleece of 7 • 47 lb. as bone dry, or 8 • 7 lb. at 16 per cent. Regain; a yield of 58 • 4 per cent as dry or 67 • 7 per cent. on the the Bradford system; an average staple length of 4 • 0 inches and a 60 's quality number with a coefficient of variability of 4 • 5 per cent., indicating a uniform group. The number of fibres per square inch of skin ranged from 31, 700 to 45, 000, {{with an average of}} 41, 600. The average fleece density was 2 • 51 per cent. Fifteen four-toothed stud ewes, recorded in 1941, gave an average greasy fleece weight of 12 • 17 lb. with 6 • 99 lb. of <b>clean</b> <b>scoured</b> wool as bone dry, or 8 • 1 lb. of clean wool at 16 per cent. Regain. The yield was 58 • 1 per cent. as dry or 67 • 3 per cent. on the Bradford system. The average staple length was 3 • 8 inches and the quality number a 60 's with a coefficient of variability of 4 • 3 per cent. showing a uniform group. The number of fibres growing per square inch of skin ranged from 30, 200 to 71, 600 with an average of 46, 700. The average fleece density was 2 • 54 per cent. It is concluded that the extremely plainbodied stud here described possesses a good stud standard of production in regard to the total wool, the length, and the fleece density. The view held by many sheepmen that extremely plainbodied sheep must necessarily have inferior fleeces, cannot be substantiated. Not only do these sheep produce profitable fleeces, but by virtue of their smooth skins and strong constitutions, they possess the practical advantages of the plain bodied type. The reliability of judging merino {{wool production}} in practice is discussed. It is contended that the judgment of fleece density and quantity of wool is difficult because of the grease factor and an increased need for fleece testing has been experienced. In the stud analysed there is a highly significant correlation between greasy fleece weights and scoured fleece weights and an insignificant correlation between greasy fleece weights and yield. In consequence, the breeder can, by selecting the highest greasy fleece weights, automatically improve upon the clean wool production. This recommendation does not hold where there is a definite relationship between greasy fleece weights and yields. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{inheritance}} and interrelationships between wool, growth and carcass traits was carried out {{as part of the}} development of a large lean white-faced sire breed. Cross-bred progeny, from three sire breeds (Romney, Dorset, and Border Leicester) mated to Romney ewes, provided information on carcass fatness and composition, liveweight, ultra-sonic backfat depth, fleeceweight and objective measures of fleece characteristics. An overall total a total of 28 sires and 765 progeny were used to collect this information. The analysis of half-sib records was carried out under an assumption of positive assortive mating on ultra-sonic backfat depth. It was considered that any bias, relative to random mating, was minimal due to incomplete assortment, dominance, epistasis and crossbreeding influences. It was assumed that the progeny were only half-sibs in relation to breed, and thus the between-breed component only estimated one-quarter of the between-breed variance. Further, the sires were nested within their respective breeds. The data corrected for the significant non-genetic effects before the variance and covariance components were estimated. In general, the estimates of the Within-breed heritability for the wool and growth traits ranged from 0. 1 to 0. 6 and were similar to literature values. The carcass estimates were higher than literature values in most cases. The incorporation of the between-breed component resulted in the between-breed heritability being larger in magnitude. This was may of been due to non-additive genetic effects, such as heterosis, in the between-breed component. The ratio of the between-breed genetic variance to the total genetic variance indicated that there was large between-breed variation in liveweight and wool traits and sma 1 l variation in the carcass traits. The total genetic and total phenotypic correlations presented here suggest that selection for lean growth and wool production can be accomplished by the joint selection of liveweight and greasy fleeceweight. Expected correlated responses in the other traits would include: a) increase liveweight and fleeceweight at all ages, increase ultra-sonic fat depth, GR measurerment, lean content, clean fleeceweight, staple length, mean fibre diameter, <b>clean</b> <b>scoured</b> yield, and b) decrease the carcass C measurement, decrease bone and fat contents, and loose wool bulk. Selection against ultra-sonic backfat depth would result in leaner animals at a constant weight. But the moderately positive correlations with liveweight and fleeceweight would appear to negate the associated advantage of a reduction in carcass fatness...|$|R

40|$|Genetic, {{phenotypic}} {{and environmental}} parameters were estimated from hogget traits recorded on 237 Perendale x (Merino x Romney) ewe hoggets between 1977 and 1984. Non-genetic effects on weaning weight (WW) for 634 ewe and ram lambs were analysed. A selection objective and criteria was defined and appraised for the flock. The traits examined were hogget liveweight (HLW), greasy fleece weight (GFW), clean fleece weight (CFW), quality number (QN), character grade (CHG), handle grade (HG), cotting grade (CG), soundness grade (SG), greasy colour grade (GCG), scoured colour grade (SCG), staple length (SL), total crimp number (TCN), <b>clean</b> <b>scoured</b> yield (Y), mean fibre diameter (MFD) and crimps per centimetre (CPC). The {{least squares method}} of fitting constants was used to estimate the major environmental factors influencing the traits studied. Heritabilities (h 2) were obtained by the daughter-dam regression (DDR) and daughter-dam correlation (DDC) methods. The genetic (rG), phenotypic (rP) and environmental (rE) correlations were calculated by the daughter-dam method. The estimates of environmental effects agree in most cases with the published estimates. Between year differences were important sources of variation and had a highly significant effect on all traits except SCG. Rearing rank effect {{was found to be}} the most important source of variation for WW and HLW. Age of dam and sex had a highly significant effect on WW. Neither rearing rank nor age of dam exerted any significant influence on wool traits. The estimates of heritability calculated by daughter-dam regression method were: HLW (0. 16), GFW (0. 17), CFW (0. 24), QN (0. 42), CHG (0. 38), SG (0. 02), GCG (0. 38), SCG (0. 09), SL (0. 12), TCN (0. 08), Y (0. 41) and MFD (0. 29). Genetic and phenotypic correlations calculated among some hogget traits were respectively: HLW x GFW (0. 67 and 0. 66); HLW x CFW (0. 62 and 0. 56); HLW x SL (0. 79 and 0. 44); HLW x MFD (- 0. 45 and 0. 24); GFW x CFW (0. 87 and 0. 94); GFW x SL (0. 37 and 0. 60); GFW x MFD (- 0. 98 and 0. 38); CFW x GCG (0. 52 and 0. 02); QN x MFD (- 0. 79 and - 0. 30); SG x MFD (0. 73 and - 0. 21); GCG x SCG (0. 87 and 0. 38); GCG x Y (0. 96 and 0. 04) and SCG x Y (0. 77 and 0. 00). Lifetime economic weights derived using the marginal profit method were calculated to define a selection objective for the flock studied. The traits included in the objective were number of lambs weaned (NLW (dam)), WW, CFW, MFD and SCG. Besides the traits in the objective, HLW, GFW, QN and GCG were included as selection criteria. The appropriate selection indices for ram hoggets (I 1), ewe hoggets (I 2) and lambs (I 3) were respectively: I 1 = 4. 66 NLW (dam) + 0. 62 HLW + 0. 10 WW + 3. 91 GFW - 1. 70 MFD + 0. 50 GCG. I 2 = 4. 79 NLW (dam) + 0. 61 HLW + 0. 04 WW + 1. 99 GFW + 0. 23 QN + 1. 60 GCG. I 3 = 4. 87 NLW (dam) + 0. 48 WW...|$|R
40|$|Selection {{responses}} and genetic parameters were estimated on wool, body and reproductive traits in a New Zealand Romney flock. In 1956 the flock {{was divided into}} 3 sub-flocks, {{each of which has}} been a closed breeding group (consisting approximately 80 ewes and 4 rams) since 1958. In one group the most open-faced yearlings were retained for breeding, in another, those with heaviest yearling fleece weights, while in the third replacements were chosen at random. Traits examined included post-shearing live weight (LW), greasy fleece weight (GFW), clean fleece weight (W), quality number (QN), character grade (CHG), staple length (SL), total crimp number (TCN), crimp frequency (CF), <b>clean</b> <b>scoured</b> yield (Y) and mean fibre diameter (MFD) for the ewes and ram and ewe hoggets; number of lambs born (LB) and number of lambs reared (LR) per ewe joined; date-of-birth (DOB), birth weight (BW), weaning weight (WW), medullameter index (MI) and face-cover grade (FC) for the ram and ewe hoggets and the standard deviation of the fibre diameter (SFD) and percent medullated fibres (PMF) for the ewe hoggets. The average inbreeding coefficient increased by approximately 0. 10 in all 3 flocks over the 21 years evaluated. Within years, sheep with the highest inbreeding coefficients generally suffered a depression in the level of performance. Heritabilities (h 2) and genetic correlations (rg) were calculated using the paternal half-sib correlation approach. Most h 2 estimates were similar to already published values. Estimates of the h 2 of ram hogget GFW were substantially smaller than corresponding ewe hogget values (0. 07 to 0. 15 cf 0. 28 to 0. 34). Face-cover grade h 2 in the face-cover flock appeared to be much reduced, suggesting a possible decline in genetic variation for this trait. Phenotypic and genetic correlations were calculated amongst all hogget traits and between ewe hogget and ewe average lifetime performance traits. Very high genetic and phenotypic correlations were found between hogget GFW and hogget W. Ewe hogget GFW tended to be positively associated with LB and LR, both genetically and phenotypically. Hogget FC was generally unrelated to other hogget and ewe traits. Ewe hogget performance in LW, GFW, W, QN, SL, TCN, Y and MFD were generally moderately to strongly related with the performance of the same ewe in corresponding traits at older ages. There was often wide variation in the three (one from each group) genetic correlation estimates for pach pair of traits. This variation was attributed to either the small number of observations available (about 80 sires per flock with 5 to 7 progeny per sire) or changing genetic variance and covariance components in the selection flocks. Realized heritability (h 2 r) estimates for FC and hogget GFW ranged between 0. 39 to 0. 54 and 0. 06 to 0. 19, respectively. The h 2 r estimates of hogget GFW were in good agreement with the paternal half-sib correlation estimates of h 2 derived from the ram hogget data but were markedly less than equivalent estimates obtained from the ewe hogget data. The h 2 r estimates of FC were generally higher than paternal half-sib estimates, but were in good agreement with estimates derived by other workers. In the face-cover flock correlated responses were generally small. Positive correlated responses of about 10 % were recorded in LB and LR over the 21 years evaluated. In the fleece weight group the components contributing toward increased GFW all showed positive correlated responses. Lamb production (LB and LR) of the fleece weight group showed an increase of about 30 %, relative to the control flock, over the 21 years studied...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{records of}} 1, 113 New Zealand Romney ewe hoggets from two subflocks {{maintained}} on control (CSR) and intensive (HSR) stocking rates were analysed. The data represented the progeny of 34 sires and were collected between 1967 and 1974 inclusive which covered four consecutive two-year sire periods. The traits investigated were hogget live-weight (HLW), greasy fleece weight (GFW), clean wool weight {{per unit area}} (WA), <b>clean</b> <b>scoured</b> yield (Y), staple length (SL), mean fibre diameter (MFD), standard deviation of the fibre diameter (SFD), quality number (QN), crimps per centimeter (CPC), total crimp number (TCN), character (CHG), tippiness (TG), handle (HG), lustre (LG), greasy colour (GCG), scoured colour (SCG), discoloured area (DAG), cotting (CG), cotted area (CAG) and soundness (SG). Stocking rate had significant effect on all the traits excepting MFD, SFD, TCN and HC. HSR depressed the traits investigated excepting Y, SFP, QN, CPC, HG, GCG, SCG, CG and CAG. Year effects except in DAG were an important source of variation. The influence of birth-rank except on HLW, SFD, CHG and HG was small. Stocking rate x year interactions except in CPC, TCN, CHG, TG, HG, GCG and CAG were important. Sire x stocking rate interactions were significant in HLW, MFD, SFD, TCN and GCG only, whereas sire x year interactions were significant in HLW, GFW, HG and SCG. Sire x stocking rate and sire x year interactions were included in different ways in some formulae for calculation of heritability estimates. These estimates were calculated from paternal half-sib analyses in CSR, HSR and combined data. The various estimates for the different traits were in the following ranges:- HLW 0. 21 - 0. 72, GFW 0. 38 - 0. 61, WA 0. 31 - 0. 49, Y 0. 19 - 0. 53, SL 0. 54 - 0. 63, MFD 0. 34 - 0. 87, SFD 0. 35 - 0. 66, QN 0. 46 - 0. 72, CPC 0. 48 - 0. 88, TCN 0. 65 - 1. 09, CHG 0. 24 - 0. 34, TG 0. 13 - 0. 27, HG 0. 23 - 0. 66, LG 0. 32 - 0. 42, GCG 0. 22 - 0. 44, SCG 0. 10 - 0. 39, DAG 0. 04 - 0. 21, CG 0. 12 - 0. 67, CAG 0. 13 - 0. 53, SG 0. 00 - 0. 22. No significant differences between the estimates in the two stocking rates except in CG and SG were observed. The relevance of these comparisons is discussed in terms of sire x stocking rate and sire x year interactions. Intra-trait genetic correlations between the two stocking rates were close to unity except in HLW (P< 0. 05); Y, SFD, GCG, SCG (0. 05 <P< 0. 1). Genetic correlations between traits were calculated by the paternal half-sib method. The correlation coefficients suggest that the HLW selection results in higher fleece weight, longer staples, better fleece character, increased variation in fibre diameter, higher quality number and crimping and more lustre. Selection for fleece weight would result in longer staples, less cotting and less susceptibility to break and increased mean fibre diameter. Correlated responses expected with selection for fineness are reduced staple length, more cotting and less sound wool. Selection for TCN results in favourable changes in HLW, GFW, TG, cotting, colour and soundness. Favourable changes in yield, crimping, discoloured area are expected following selection for whiteness of a midside sample, whereas GFW could decline. Applications of the results are discussed with particular reference to the role played by sire x stocking rate and sire x year interactions in the genetic improvement of characters of economic importance in New Zealand Romney sheep...|$|R

25|$|A {{biological}} {{survey was}} carried out in 1993, near Rother Valley Country Park, and only seven types of invertebrates were found, all of which were highly tolerant to pollution. It was recognised that the straight engineered channel where the river had been re-instated after coal mining was not well suited to the support of life, and so a stone weir was constructed, to help with natural aeration of the water, and to increase the flow velocity so that the gravel below the weir was <b>scoured</b> <b>clean.</b> A bay was constructed above the weir, where fish could escape when the river was affected by flooding or pollution incidents. A trial release of fish, funded by contributions from Rhone Poulenc, Coalite Chemicals and Yorkshire Water, was made in April 1994. Half of the total of 2,500 chub and 2,500 roach were released near the new weir, and the other half at Hall Road in Staveley. It soon became clear from anglers that the fish were spreading along the river, and a further 40,000 fish were released that winter. Another survey in September 1995 revealed good growth rates in the fish, and barbel were thriving. Brown trout, thought to have come from the River Hipper or the Barlow Brook, were also found in the Rother, and since these are much less tolerant to organic pollution and low oxygen levels, were a clear indicator that conditions were improving. The following year, chub and dace were released at Old Whittington, and clear evidence that the fish were breeding in the river was found. The river had become a self-sustaining fishery again, and organised angling began {{for the first time in}} over 100 years.|$|R
