2500|$|The {{shift to}} the CWG process {{initially}} resulted in a reduced output of water gas tar {{as compared to the}} volume of coal tars. The advent of automobiles reduced the availability of naphtha for <b>carburetion</b> oil, as that fraction was desirable as motor fuel. MGPs that shifted to heavier grades of oil often experienced problems with the production of tar-water emulsions, which were difficult, time consuming, and costly to break. (The cause of tar change ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] 389 four-barrel V8 {{remained}} the standard engine. A new lineup of optional engines was introduced this year {{which included the}} [...] 389 Tri-Power and three versions of the larger 421in³ V8 including a standard four-barrel version rated at , a [...] Tri-Power option, and the 421 HO option with Tri-Power <b>carburetion</b> and [...] The same selection of transmissions continued including the standard three-speed manual, optional four-speed manual, or three-speed Roto Hydra-matic.

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 40, DeLorean {{had broken}} the record for {{youngest}} division head at GM, and was determined to continue his string of successes. Adapting to the frustrations that he perceived in the executive offices was, however, a difficult transition for him. DeLorean believed there was an undue amount of infighting at GM between divisional heads, and several of Pontiac's advertising campaign themes met with internal resistance, such as the [...] "Tiger" [...] campaign used to promote the GTO and other Pontiac models in 1965 and 1966. One of the biggest disappointments for Pontiac was the GM's fourteenth floor's Ed Cole's decision to ban multiple <b>carburetion.</b> Multiple <b>carburetion</b> had been with Pontiac since 1956 starting with 2X4 bbls. and Pontiac's famous Tri-Power (3X2bbls.) since 1957. Ironically the only GM cars to escape this ban was Ed Cole's beloved Corvair and Corvette. There are scores of this conflict with Ed Cole that go way back to Bunkie Knudsen. The most memorable would be the 1964 GTO {{was supposed to be}} equipped with disc brakes which were even tooled for free by Kelsey Hayes, and radial tires were supposed to be offered but were killed by Cole as well.|$|E
2500|$|The 1967 {{model year}} saw the {{introduction}} for the Pontiac Firebird pony car, {{a variant of}} the Chevrolet Camaro that was the brand's answer to the hot-selling Ford Mustang. Intermediate sized cars (Tempest, LeMans, GTO) were mildly face-lifted but all full size cars and GTO lost their Tri-Power engine option though it did get a larger 400 cubic-inch V8 that replaced the previous 389. Full-sized cars got a major facelift with rounder wasp-waisted body lines, a name change for the mid-line series from Star Chief to Executive and a one-year-only Grand Prix convertible. 1968 introduced the Endura 'rubber' front bumper on the GTO, the precursor to modern cars' integrated bumpers, and {{the first of a series}} [...] "Ram Air" [...] engines, which featured the induction of cold air to the carburetor(s) for more power, and took away some of the sting from deleting the famous Tri-Power multiple <b>carburetion</b> option from the engine line up. This Tri carburetor deletion came from the 14th floor of GM banning multiple <b>carburetion</b> and headed by GM president Ed Cole. The Ram Air V garnered much auto press publicity, but only a relative few were made available for sale. Full-sized cars and intermediates reverted from vertical to horizontal headlights while the sporty/performance 2+2 was dropped from the lineup.|$|E
2500|$|Drivetrains were {{unchanged}} from 1964 {{with the}} 250-horsepower two-barrel carbureted 300-cubic-inch V8 the standard powerplant on all models {{with a standard}} three-speed manual transmission or optional four-speed manual or two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic. Available at extra cost with the new LeSabre [...] "400" [...] package was the 250-horsepower 300-cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel <b>carburetion</b> and 10.25 to 1 compression which required premium fuel, compared to the standard two-barrel engine that used regular fuel. The 400 package also included the more desirable Super Turbine [...] "400" [...] three-speed automatic transmission also found in Buick's higher-priced Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera models.|$|E
2500|$|For 1973, {{wider and}} lower split {{waterfall}} grilles flanked a new federally mandated [...] front bumper on all Delta 88 models and larger one-piece rounded rectangular taillights replaced the four-segmented lights of 1972. Engine offerings included a standard 350 Rocket V8 with two-barrel carburetor (150 net horsepower) or optional 455 Rocket V8 with four-barrel <b>carburetion</b> and [...] with single exhaust or [...] with dual exhausts. Model offerings {{were the same}} as 1972 with the Delta 88 Royale series now including the sole Olds convertible offering following the demise of the intermediate Cutlass Supreme convertible after 1972.|$|E
2500|$|... water {{emulsions}} {{is complex}} and was related to several factors, including free carbon in the <b>carburetion</b> oil and the substitution of bituminous coal as a feedstock instead of coke.) The production of large volumes of tar-water emulsions quickly filled up available storage capacity at MGPs and plant management often dumped the emulsions in pits, from which {{they may or may}} not have been later reclaimed. Even if the emulsions were reclaimed, the environmental damage from placing tars in unlined pits remained. The dumping of emulsions (and other tarry residues such as tar sludges, tank bottoms, and off-spec tars) into the soil and waters around MGPs is a significant factor in the pollution found at FMGPs today.|$|E
2500|$|The styling {{changes for}} 1941 were modest, but the changes {{under the hood}} were major. The {{compression}} ratio was raised from 6.6:1 to 7.0:1, the [...] "turbulator" [...] pistons were redesigned, smaller spark plugs were substituted for the previous type and “Compound Carburetion” was introduced. Compound <b>Carburetion</b> was the forerunner of the modern four-barrel carburetor, and consisted of twin two-barrel carburetors. One unit operated all of the time, while the other operated only under hard acceleration. The new engine delivered 165 horsepower. With five more horsepower than a senior Packard, 15 more than any Cadillac, and 25 more than the largest Chryslers, {{it was the most}} powerful engine available that year on an American car.|$|E
2500|$|The {{performance}} was such in 1923, three tourers [...] "put up a passable showing" [...] {{at the first}} 24 Hours of Le Mans, leading to the creation for 1924 of the 15 Sport, with twin <b>carburetion,</b> larger valves, and Dewandre-Reprusseau servo-assisted four-wheel brakes (at a time when four-wheel brakes of any kind were a rarity); they ran second and third, and were comparable to the 3 litre Bentleys. The 15 CV Sport did better in 1925, winning Le Mans, followed home by a sister in third, while in 1926, Bloch and Rossignol won at an average 106km/h (66mph), leading a 1-2-3 sweep by Lorraines. Lorraine-Dietrich thus became the first marque to win Le Mans twice {{and the first to}} win in two consecutive years.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Carburetion</b> {{had five}} {{separate}} circuits. Suzuki used peripheral ports for the RE5, as they give better high-speed running but {{are known to}} have low-speed issues. This is dealt with by using a two-stage Mikuni carburetor. An 18mm throat splits into two small peripheral induction tracts. The primary butterfly is directly controlled by one of the five throttle cables, providing smooth low-speed running. A diaphragm controls the secondary carburetor port, and this is activated when a set vacuum is reached in the carburetor circuit. This much larger 32mm port enters the rotor chamber between and slightly below the two small primary ports. Indirectly involved with <b>carburetion</b> is the unique [...] "port valve". This small butterfly valve pivots in the rotor housing inside the secondary port and is directly controlled by another of the throttle cables. Without the port valve, the long induction tract of the secondary port would fill with traces of exhaust gasses whenever the secondary valve was closed. This occurs as the tip of the rotor passes the induction port {{at the end of the}} exhaust cycle before beginning the induction cycle. If this was allowed to happen, when the secondary throat finally opened the engine would first swallow an induction charge contaminated with exhaust gasses causing a momentary misfire and felt as a dead spot or hesitation in acceleration. The port valve is therefore effectively timed to remain closed whenever the secondary carburetor throat is closed, isolating the induction tract from exhaust gasses. Carburetor tuning involves adjusting cables controlling the primary butterfly and the port valve, among other things, illustrated by Suzuki Service Bulletin Nine. The carburetor also incorporated a fuel pump which was mechanically actuated at 35 degrees of primary butterfly movemement (later changed to 28 degrees) to enrich the fuel mixture during acceleration.|$|E
2500|$|In 1957 engine {{displacement}} grew to [...] with the [...] "Super Turbo Fire V8" [...] option producing [...] {{with the help}} of continuous (closed loop) mechanical fuel injection. These so-called [...] "fuelie" [...] cars are quite rare, since most Bel Airs were fitted with <b>carburetion.</b> The 1957 Bel Air is among the most recognizable American cars of all time; well-maintained examples, especially Sport Coupes and Convertibles are highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts. They are roomy, with tastefully restrained, period use tail fins and chrome. A second automatic transmission, Turboglide, was optional. [...] While the original two-speed Powerglide continued unchanged, Turboglide provided a continuously variable gear ratio which made [...] "shifting" [...] imperceptible. [...] The shift quadrant on Turboglide cars followed a [...] "P R N D Gr" [...] pattern.|$|E
2500|$|The GTO {{also saw}} several {{mechanical}} changes in 1967. The Tri-Power <b>carburetion</b> system {{was replaced with}} a Rochester Quadrajet four-barrel carburetor. The 389 engine received a larger cylinder bore (4.12inches, 104.7mm) for a total displacement of 400CID (6.5L) V8. The 400 cubic inch engine was available in three models: economy, standard, and high output. The economy engine used a two-barrel carburetor rather than the Rochester Quadrajet and produced [...] at 4400 rpm, and [...] at 3400 rpm. The standard engine produced [...] at 5000 rpm, and the highest torque of the three engines at [...] at 3400 rpm. The high output engine produced the most power for that year at [...] at 5100 rpm, and produced [...] at 3600 rpm. Emission controls were fitted in GTOs sold in California.|$|E
2500|$|A new {{crosshatch}} grille {{and revised}} taillight lenses {{were the only}} appearance changes made to the 1979 Grand Prix. The same models, base, LJ and SJ continued as before as did the basic engine lineup including the [...] Buick V6 standard on base and LJ models, the [...] Pontiac V8 with two-barrel carburetor that was optional on both of those models, and the [...] 301 V8 with four-barrel <b>carburetion</b> that was standard on the SJ and optional on the other models. Transmissions remained the same as before with the three-speed manual standard with the V6 engine on the base model and automatic transmission optional. The automatic transmission was standard on LJ and SJ models and all models when a V8 engine was ordered. Again, the Pontiac V8s were not available in California, where they were replaced by Chevy [...] rated at 140 and [...]|$|E
2500|$|When postwar {{automobile}} production resumed in the 1946 model year, chrome {{was more}} sparingly applied, swept-back fenders were fitted to sedans {{as well as}} coupes, and a war-inspired [...] "bombsight" [...] hood ornament was adopted. The instrument panel was two-toned with woodgrain facings except on convertibles which used body-colored panels. Series identification was found on cloisonne emblems centered in the bumper guard front and rear. Compound <b>Carburetion</b> was eliminated and the compression ratio was reduced to 6.60:1. As a consequence the 1946 Roadmaster's horsepower fell from 165 to 144. Torque {{on the other hand}} was hardly affected. Nevertheless, Roadmaster’s [...] I-8 still produced more horsepower than a top of the line Chrysler's. Due to wartime inflation prices were substantially higher. The biggest change was in sales proportions. Roadmaster increased its share of Buick sales from four percent in 1941 to 20 percent in 1946, with a total of about 31,400 sold.|$|E
2500|$|The first Pontiac GTO was {{an option}} {{package for the}} Pontiac Tempest, {{available}} with the two-door coupe, hardtop, and convertible body styles. The US$295 package included a [...] V8 rated at [...] at 4800rpm with a single Carter AFB four-barrel carburetor and dual exhaust, chromed valve covers and air cleaner, seven-blade clutch fan, a floor-shifted three-speed manual transmission with Hurst shifter, stiffer springs, larger diameter front sway bar, wider wheels with 7.50 × 14 redline tires, hood scoops, and GTO badges. Optional equipment included a four-speed manual, Super Turbine 300 two-speed automatic transmission, more powerful [...] "Tri-Power" [...] <b>carburetion</b> (three two-barrel Rochester 2G carburetors) rated at , metallic drum brake linings, limited-slip differential, heavy-duty cooling, ride and handling package, and the usual array of power and convenience accessories. With every available option, the GTO cost about US$4,500 and weighed around [...] A tachometer was optional, and {{was placed in the}} far right dial on the dash.|$|E
2500|$|The 1976 [...] four-cylinder engine, {{as used in}} the Vega {{got some}} refinements. Named [...] "Dura-built 140", it {{features}} quieter hydraulic lifters eliminating valve adjustments. The basic four develops 70 horsepower, but two-barrel <b>carburetion</b> increases the rating to 84. The 1976 model was the introduction of Chevrolet's new 5.0 liter (305 CID) V8 engine with a two-barrel carburetor generating [...] at 3800 rpm, but only for California and high-altitude Monza customers, and replaced the 5.7 liter (350 CID) V8. The 262 V8 was again the optional engine in 49 states. A mid-year option for the 1976 model year was a sport front end available for the Towne Coupe, which features the 2+2's polyurethane front end and quad headlamps. The Monza Spyder option package was first introduced in 1976. It features a two-barrel carburetor version of the four-cylinder engine as standard, a floor console, F41 suspension with larger front and rear stabilizer bars, and special shock absorbers. This equipment had been standard on the original 1975 2+2 (excluding the mid-year [...] "S" [...] model).|$|E
