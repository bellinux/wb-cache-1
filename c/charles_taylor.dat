Adam dresses as Sabrina, scares Ashley and she falls down a staircase, {{causing her to}} miscarry her child, whose father is Victor. Adam then blackmails her doctor, <b>Charles</b> <b>Taylor,</b> into telling her that her child was still alive. Rafe Torres (Yani Gellman) is appointed to investigate Adam, who seduces him to divert his attention from Adam's criminal activity.

5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal.

Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, <b>Charles</b> <b>Taylor,</b> the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E
5|$|In 1837, Sherman {{left school}} {{and found a}} job as a junior {{surveyor}} on construction of improvements to the Muskingum River.

The following year, he moved to Mansfield to study law in the office of his older brother, <b>Charles</b> <b>Taylor</b> Sherman. He was admitted to the bar in 1844 and joined his brother's firm. Sherman quickly became successful at the practice of law, and by 1847 had accumulated property worth $10,000 and was a partner in several local businesses. By that time, Sherman and his brother Charles were able to support their mother and two unmarried sisters, who now moved to a house Sherman purchased in Mansfield.
