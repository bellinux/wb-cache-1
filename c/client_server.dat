2500|$|In November 1990, Wang {{announced}} their first personal computers running Unix. Previously, Wang's {{presence in the}} UNIX and open systems markets had been modest. In 1987, Wang developed a new typesetting system in conjunction with Arlington MA-based Texet Corp. The system used Xerox printers and UNIX workstations from Sun, but the product vanished before coming to market, partially because few Wang employees could use or support UNIX. UNIX ran on the VSInteractive Systems first ported IN/ix (their IBM360 version of SYS5 UNIX) to run in a VSOS Virtual machine circa 1985, and then Wang engineers completed the port so that it ran [...] "native" [...] on the VS hardware soon thereafterbut performance was always sub-par as UNIX was never {{a good fit for}} the inherently batch-mode nature of the VS hardware, and the line-at-a-time processing approach taken by the VS workstations; indeed, the workstation code had to be largely rewritten to bundle up each keystroke into a frame to be sent back to the host when running UNIX so that [...] "tty" [...] style processing could be implemented. PACE, which offered its data dictionary, excellent referential integrity, and speedy application development, {{was in the process of}} being ported to UNIX under the name OPEN Pace. A <b>client</b> <b>server</b> RDBMS model, built on the original product's ideology, OPEN Pace was demonstrated at the North American PACE User Group Conferences in both Boston and Chicago. OPEN Pace, along with a new Windows-based word processor called UpWord (which was at the time considered a strong contender to retake Wang's original market leadership from Microsoft), were touted as their new direction. However, after a marketing study suggested that it would require large capital investments in order to be viable competitors against Microsoft, both products were simply abandoned.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in {{software and hardware}} changed the way database systems are built and operate. In this paper we present database architectures based on the <b>Client</b> [...] <b>Server</b> paradigm and study their performance and scalability under different query/update workloads. The architectures are: Standard <b>Client</b> [...] <b>Server,</b> <b>Client</b> [...] <b>Server</b> with Multiple Disks, and Enhanced <b>Client</b> [...] <b>Server.</b> Data replication and client query result caching are used as the main mechanisms to improve the query throughput. The role of the server is to maintain system [...] wide data consistency {{and in the case}} of Enhanced <b>Client</b> [...] <b>Server</b> to selectively propagate updates on demand. Our study shows that except for the case of mostly update workloads, the Standard <b>Client</b> [...] <b>Server</b> architecture is outperformed by the other two architectures by one or more orders of magnitude. The <b>Client</b> [...] <b>Server</b> with Multiple Disks architecture offers performance comparable to that achieved by the Enhanced <b>Client</b> [...] <b>Server</b> f [...] ...|$|R
