25|$|A {{wide range}} of social reforms were carried out during Moro's periods as prime minister. The 1967 Ponte Law (Legge Ponte) {{introduced}} urgent housing provisions {{as part of an}} envisioned reform of the entire sector, such as the introduction of minimum standards for housing and environment. A law promulgated on 14 December 1963 introduced an annual allowance for university students with income below a given level. Another law, promulgated on 10 March 1968, introduced voluntary public pre-elementary education for children aged three to five years. A law promulgated on 21 July 1965 introduced new pension provisions under the general scheme. The legal minima was raised, all current pensions were revalued, seniority pensions (pensioni d’anzianità) were introduced (after 35 years of contributions workers could retire even before attaining pensionable age), and within the national social security institution (Istituto nazionale della previdenza sociale), a Social Fund (Fondo Sociale) was established, ensuring to all members pensioners a basic uniform pension largely financed by state, known as the social pension (not related to the later social pension introduced in 1968). A law of 22 July 1966 extended pension insurance to small traders. A law of 22 July 1966 extended health insurance to retired traders, and a law of 29 May 1967 extended compulsory health insurance to retired farmers, tenant farmers, and sharecroppers, and extended health insurance to the unemployed in receipt of unemployment benefits. A law of 18 March 1968 introduced the principle of earnings-related pensions within the general scheme, with the pension formula to equal 1.626% of average earnings in the last 3 years of work multiplied by the number of <b>contribution</b> <b>years</b> (maximum pension: 65% of previous earnings) up to 40.

3000|$|As {{noted by}} Hairault et al.

In the 2006 TWR survey, individuals report the number of years they have contributed to the pension system so far. As in 2006, the required number of <b>contribution</b> <b>years</b> to be entitled to a pension at the highest replacement rate is 40 years, the distance to the full pension age is obtained by subtracting the number of years individuals have already contributed from 40.

Formally, the distance D [...]...|$|E
30|$|If a {{disability}} award is made, an individual receives {{a disability}} pension {{from the first}} pillar, which is a pay-as-you-go system aimed at guaranteeing a basic standard of living. The level of the first pillar pension is an increasing function {{in the number of}} <b>contribution</b> <b>years,</b> average lifetime earnings, and the number of dependent children. Individuals who contributed to the second pillar prior to disability onset automatically receive a disability pension from the second pillar if they have been awarded a disability pension from the first pillar. The second pillar is an employer-based, fully funded occupational pension scheme, which is mandatory for all employees whose annual earnings exceed CHF 20, 000. The net replacement rate of the first two pillars amounts to 60 - 80 % and can reach 100 % for beneficiaries with dependent children. DI beneficiaries may claim means-tested supplemental benefits if the combined income from the two pillars is not sufficient to cover basic needs. These benefits guarantee an income of CHF 3, 000 per month for singles and CHF 4, 500 per month for couples.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAs most {{developed}} countries, France {{has gone}} over the last 20 years {{through a process of}} pension system reforms, mainly aiming at increasing the average retirement age, through increasing the required number of <b>contribution</b> <b>years</b> or through postponing legal (minimal and/or normal) ages. Public debates over which lever should be preferred have been paramount in France, with concerns focusing on redistribution issues between high wage high life-expectancy and low-wage low life-expectancy workers. In this paper, we empirically address this issue by simulating the differentiated impacts of the past French reforms on average retirement ages across wage quartiles. Our simulations show that increasing the required duration criterion –as was done by the 1993 and 2003 reforms– have redistributive impact as regards retirement age, while increasing the normal age –as was done by the 2010 reform– has a counter-distributive impact. The redistributive impact on average of the required duration criterion however only holds thanks to the fact that disabled workers –most of them in the lowest wage quartile– are exempted from it. Last, increasing minimal age has ambiguous impacts according to gender: redistributive among women but counter-distributive among men...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{preliminary}} estimate of the financial impact of the recent reform of the Spanish pension system. After updating the projections of pension expenditure constructed in de la Fuente and Doménech (2010) for the period 2008 - 60, we analyze the impact on this variable of raising the retirement age from 65 to 67 years, extending from 15 to 25 years the period over which wages are averaged to calculate the starting pension and increasing from 35 to 37 the number of <b>contribution</b> <b>years</b> required to obtain a "full pension. " Conditional {{on a series of}} assumptions about the evolution of employment, productivity and demographics, our estimates suggest that these measures will reduce pension expenditure by up to 1. 4 percentage points of GDP once the reforms have been fully implemented in 2027, thereby stabilizing pension expenditure at a bit over 9 % of GDP during the transition period and preventing the emergence of a structural deficit in the system {{before the end of the}} next decade. On the other hand, the existing uncertainty about the future evolution of the relevant variables suggests that it would be desirable to bring forward in time the introduction of the periodic evaluation of the system (the so-called sustainability factor) so as to have in place a mechanism that can be used to modulate the rhythm and scope of the reform if the system's financial situation requires it before the end of the transitional period...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of caval {{contribution}} to {{flow in the}} Right and Left Pulmonary Artery (RPA and LPA) of Fontan patients is of great interest, because uneven flow distribution to the lungs is associated with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. However, in Fontan circulation more than 1 source of flow to the RPA and LPA is present, which makes difficult to quantify the flow distribution with standard methods. Although a novel MRI application was developed to quantify caval <b>contribution</b> <b>years</b> ago, it has limitations {{and it is not}} applicable to patients with turbulent flow in the Pulmonary Arteries (PA) [1]. We propose a new method to easily quantify the flow distribution in Fontan patients. Methods A 4 D Flow sequence was acquired in 12 healthy volunteers and 9 Fontan patients on a 1. 5 T Philips scan. Flow distribution was quantified with particles traces using the software “GTFlow”. The new method consists of emitting particles from a Region Of Interest (ROI) with a temporal resolution of ~ 40 ms. Then, we quantified the flow distribution by counting the particles arriving to a different ROI. To validate this method, 2 independent observers compared the flow contribution of the main PA to the RPA and LPA in healthy volunteers. This was done calculating net forward flow, which was used to validate the distribution of flow obtained with our new method. Thereafter, we quantified the flow distribution of the Superior and Inferior Vena Cava (SVC andIVC) totheRPAandLPAinFontanpatients...|$|E
