40|$|The {{ability to}} extract and analyse correct {{precedent}} cases and <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> is critical because recommending correct <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> {{is of utmost}} importance in ensuring that every case is trialed accordingly. Currently, precedent cases and <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> are searched and extracted manually thus, causing backlog in juvenile delinquency trials. This paper discusses {{the development of a}} Juvenile Delinquency Legal Reasoning (JDLRes) Model that has the ability to imitate human reasoning in assisting probation officer to recommend <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> for juvenile delinquency cases. Rule-based reasoning (RBR) and case-based reasoning (CBR) are the techniques used to add consistency with flexibility when recommending <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> for new cases. The simulation model was developed to validate JDLRes Model. The comparison results between the model and human expert reveal the existence of generality aspect in the legal domain. Future work requires the study of precedent cases and <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> in different states in Malaysia...|$|R

5000|$|It is an {{established}} procedure in the UK for rights-holders to use 'Section 97' <b>court</b> <b>orders</b> to require ISPs to block copyright-infringing sites.
