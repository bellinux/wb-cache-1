25|$|When Mark Coleman got {{injured and}} had {{to drop out of}} his matchup against Tito Ortiz, Griffin {{accepted}} a rematch against Ortiz at UFC 106. Griffin also wore white and black fight shorts instead of his trademark tan shorts for the fight. Griffin {{went on to win the}} gory battle by split decision, showing superior striking skills and a stronger ground game than in their previous fight. After the fight Griffin said, “Tito was a great fight for me to come back, we’ll have to do a third that’s 1-1 man.” With a split decision in both of their fights, Griffin seemed more than willing to get a rubber match put together with Ortiz to settle the score once and for all. “You <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> was a guy getting ready for Mark Coleman, no offense, and he’s a guy coming off back surgery. We’ll do it again, I won’t break my foot, he’ll be in better shape,” commented Griffin.|$|E
500|$|Disraeli's {{literary}} and political career interacted over his lifetime and fascinated Victorian Britain, making him [...] "one {{of the most}} eminent figures in Victorian public life", and occasioned a large output of commentary. Critic Shane Leslie noted three decades after his death that [...] "Disraeli's career was a romance such as no Eastern vizier or Western plutocrat <b>could</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>He</b> began as a pioneer in dress and an aesthete of words.... Disraeli actually made his novels come true." ...|$|E

60|$|Bradley was silent. How <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> {{her what}} she had become to him? How <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> {{her that she was}} woven into the {{innermost}} mesh of his intellectual fibre.|$|R
500|$|J. P. Davis was {{inspired}} to write the script after observing an older trainer working with a young boxer in a Brooklyn gym: [...] "I watched the guy spar. You <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> wasn't going anywhere, but you could never convince the trainer. He's almost a caretaker. He's watching out for you completely. You could see the devotion involved." [...] Drawing upon material originally created for his critically acclaimed one-man off-Broadway show [...] "Dreamer Awakens," [...] Davis completed the script in 1999 and moved to Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Ponsford used a heavy bat——nicknamed [...] "Big Bertha". Opposition players {{sometimes}} {{joked that}} Ponsford's bat {{was larger than}} allowed under the laws of cricket and indeed in one match in Sydney, it {{was found to be}} slightly larger than permitted—the result of the bat spreading from his powerful hitting. Throughout his innings, Ponsford would pull his cap further to the left. Robinson claimed that [...] "if you saw the peak at a rakish angle towards his left ear you <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> was heading for his second hundred". When volunteering for service with the Royal Australian Air Force, Ponsford discovered he possessed abnormal colour vision, unable to distinguish red from green. The examining doctor was astonished and asked Ponsford, [...] "What colour did [...] look to you after it was worn?" [...] Ponsford replied, [...] "I never noticed its colour, only its size." [...] A later study identified Ponsford's specific colour vision as protanopia, a form of dichromacy in which red appears dark. Ponsford did not enjoy batting on rain-affected wickets. When on tour his teammates did not ask if it had rained last night, merely [...] "Did Ponny wake during the night?"—legend had it that even the slightest trickle would wake him and have him anguishing over having to bat on the [...] "sticky" [...] in the morning.|$|E
500|$|On October 25, 2005, Giants patriarch Wellington Mara {{died after}} a brief illness, {{at the age of}} 89. Mara had been {{involved}} with the Giants since he was nine years old, when he was a ball boy for the team. Mara was universally beloved by the players. Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson, who played during some of the team's down years in the 1970s, never became angry at Mara despite being frustrated with the team's performances. [...] "The Giants’ organization cares about its players more than most teams in the NFL. This stems from the top. The Maras are family men and Wellington, especially, has sought to cultivate a family atmosphere in the team.... If any NFL owner deserves a championship, it is Mara." [...] According to Parcells, Wellington made an effort {{to get to know each}} of his players. [...] "The Giants are Wellington Mara’s whole life, they have been his whole life. He’s at the office every day, he’s at practice very day, he loves hanging around the locker room and getting to know the players." [...] Despite his strong religious convictions, he put aside his personal beliefs, and avoided preaching to players who were having problems. [...] "Nobody did more for me than Wellington Mara." [...] Lawrence Taylor said. [...] "He didn’t have to save me, he didn’t have to keep helping me to find help.... And he never lectured me. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> disapproved but he never lectured me." [...] Several players went to Mara's bedside as he was dying to say goodbye to the owner. The team dedicated their next game to Mara, and shut out the Redskins 36–0.|$|E

60|$|All {{the blood}} in Watty Wilkins's body seemed to fly back to his heart, and {{immediately}} after it rushed to his brain and toes. Prompt action! no time to think! Life! death! Watty never afterwards <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> clearly what <b>he</b> felt or did on that tremendous occasion, but Jack <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> what <b>he</b> did, for he saw him do it.|$|R

2500|$|A {{number of}} media critics, {{including}} Toronto Sun columnist and former radio personality Ted Woloshyn, criticized CP24 Radio 1050 {{as a poor}} substitute for a true news radio format. In his column on the format change, Woloshyn noted {{a number of instances}} where he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> was listening to content that had been prepared for television, not radio, presentation: ...|$|E
2500|$|McKagan {{was one of}} {{the last}} people {{confirmed}} to have seen Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain before he died on April 5, 1994. He sat next to Cobain on a flight from Los Angeles to Seattle on April 1. McKagan later recalled, [...] "I didn't have any foresight that the guy was going to do what he did. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> was bummed out, and I'd been that way before... I thought I'd ask him to come stay at my house; I turned around and he was gone." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, Haggard {{recorded}} [...] "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive," [...] {{also written}} by Liz Anderson {{with her husband}} Casey Anderson, which became his first number-one single. When the Andersons presented the song to Haggard, they were unaware of his prison stretch. Bonnie Owens, Haggard's backup singer and then-wife, is quoted by music journalist Daniel Cooper in the liner notes to the 1994 retrospective Down Every Road: [...] "I guess I didn't realize how much the experience at San Quentin did to him, 'cause he {{never talked about it}} all that much.... I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> was in a dark mood ... and I said, 'Is everything okay?' And he said, 'I'm really scared.' And I said, 'Why?' And he said, 'Cause I'm afraid someday I'm gonna be out there ... and there's gonna be ... some prisoner ... in there the same time I was in, stand up—and they're gonna be about the third row down—and say, 'What do you think you're doing, 45200?'" [...] Cooper notes that the news had little effect on Haggard's career: [...] "It's unclear when or where Merle first acknowledged to the public that his prison songs were rooted in personal history, for to his credit, he doesn't seem to have made some big splash announcement. In a May 1967 profile in Music City News, his prison record is never mentioned, but in July 1968, in the very same publication, it's spoken of as if it were common knowledge." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{waited for}} a few seconds and then whistled once more. Was he mistaken, or did an {{answering}} whistle sound out? <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b> <b>He</b> set his face grimly and trudged on.|$|R
50|$|In 1982, a Russian {{physicist}} {{discovered something}} extraordinary {{was behind the}} strange radar anomalies he was recording. Something dark, which will eventually alter the path of mankind. Before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> anyone, <b>he</b> mysteriously vanished.|$|R

60|$|What {{the captain}} thought no one <b>could</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>He</b> {{remained}} on the bridge night and day, clad {{from head to foot}} in oil-skin garments, facing the furious blast as if it were his native air, watching every motion of his vessel, and gazing intently into the world of ebony ahead as if trying to read his fate there.|$|E
60|$|He {{lapsed into}} a pensive torpor. The {{immediate}} dangers and stresses {{of his position}} he saw {{with a sort of}} static clearness.

60|$|At last an old colonel starts up, {{and asked}} the general what he thought might {{occasion}} the writing this letter?

Then a doubt was started, whether the king and Parliament were not in any treaty, which this agreement might be prejudicial to.|$|E
60|$|Made {{reckless}} by this, I {{stepped down}} to another branch {{directly over the}} bear, and tried again to rope him. It was of no use.

I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> was growing angrier every instant, and also braver. Suddenly the noose, quite by accident, caught his nose. He wagged his head and I pulled. The noose tightened.|$|E

But this does not acquit him, Mrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners so very disengaged? What right had he to endeavour to please, as he certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged to another?--How <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> what mischief <b>he</b> might be doing?--How <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>he</b> might not be making me in love with him?--very wrong, very wrong indeed." ...|$|R
