50|$|Literally {{shredding}} paper documents {{prior to}} their disposal is a commonplace physical information security control, intended to prevent the information content - if not the media - from falling into the wrong hands. Digital data can also be shredded in a figurative sense, either by being strongly encrypted or by being repeatedly overwritten until there is no realistic probability of the information ever being retrieved, even using sophisticated forensic analysis: this too constitutes a physical information security control since the purged <b>computer</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> can be freely discarded or sold without compromising the original information content. The two techniques may be combined in high-security situations, where digital shredding of the data content is followed by physical shredding and incineration to destroy the storage media.|$|E

[...] A solution was found in flash memory, which is an electronic non-volatile <b>computer</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. Solid-state storage typically uses the NAND type of flash memory, which may be written and read in chunks {{much smaller than the}} entire size of the storage device. The size of a minimal chunk (page) for read operations is much smaller than the minimal chunk size (block) for write/erase operations, resulting in an undesirable phenomenon called write amplification that limits the random write performance and write endurance of flash-based solid-state storage devices. Another type of solid-state storage devices uses volatile random-access memory (RAM) combined with a battery that allows the contents of RAM to be preserved for a limited amount of time after the device's power supply is interrupted. As an advantage, RAM-based solid-state storage is much faster compared to flash, and does not experience write amplification.|$|E

Meanwhile, the information revolution and the extraordinary increase in the spread of knowledge have given birth to a new era [...] one of knowledge and information which effects directly economic, social, cultural and political activities of all regions of the world, including Nigeria. Through technologies such as DVDs, laptop <b>computers,</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media,</b> Internet, satellite TV, cellular telephones, and videoconferencing; globalization creates spectacular opportunities for increasing the dissemination of information and dialogue. But, there is a drastic inequality of accessibility of networks between the urban and rural dwellers. However, this paper examines the social inequality attached to the jagged accessibility of new technologies among rural dwellers in Nigeria. Exchanging information among people promotes the sharing of ideas, values, collaboration and knowledge production but the means by which these social advantages can be of importance are unevenly distributed in the local communities. This paper observes the factors causing technological divide between the urban areas and rural areas in Nigeria, which has drastically reduced the social actions and development among the dwellers, and even in the community. It easy to identify technology as a unifying force, bringing together various cultural uniqueness, peoples and thought patterns via channels of global networks but it is disheartening to know that network inequality between rural and urban areas has dwindled the level of social services available to rural masses. Thus, this study intends to x-ray the empowerment of rural inhabitants in the spatial hierarchy creating public access points and community connectivity...|$|R

These unusual results indicate the presence of long range repulsive interactions. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and density functional theory calculations support this conclusion. In addition to answering an outstanding question in epitaxial growth, i. e., to find systems where long range interactions are present, the high density of magnetic islands, tunable with θ, is of interest for nanomagnetism applications...|$|E

40|$|Flash memory devices—that is, {{non-volatile}} <b>computer</b> <b>storage</b> <b>media</b> {{that can}} be electrically erased and reprogrammed—are vital for portable electronics, but the scaling down of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) flash memory to sizes of below ten nanometres per data cell presents challenges. Molecules have been proposed to replace MOS flash memory 1, but they suffer from low electrical conductivity, high resistance, low device yield, and finite thermal stability, limiting their integration into current MOS technologies. Although great advances {{have been made in}} the pursuit of molecule-based flash memory 2, there are a number of significant barriers to the realization of devices using conventional MOS technologies 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Here we show that core–shell polyoxometalate (POM) molecules 8 can act as candidate storage nodes for MOS flash memory. Realistic, industry-standard device simulations validate our approach at the nanometre scale, where the device performance is determined mainly by the number of molecules in the storage media and not by their position. To exploit the nature of the core–shell POM clusters, we show, at both the molecular and device level, that embedding [(Se(IV) O 3) 2] 4 − as an oxidizable dopant in the cluster core allows the oxidation of the molecule to a [Se(V) 2 O 6] 2 − moiety containing a {Se(V) –Se(V) } bond (where curly brackets indicate a moiety, not a molecule) and reveals a new 5 + oxidation state for selenium. This new oxidation state can be observed at the device level, resulting in a new type of memory, which we call ‘write-once-erase’. Taken together, these results show that POMs have the potential to be used as a realistic nanoscale flash memory. Also, the configuration of the doped POM core may lead to new types of electrical behaviour 9, 10, 11. This work suggests a route to the practical integration of configurable molecules in MOS technologies as the lithographic scales approach the molecular limit 12...|$|E

How would you dispose of your old computer, or how would the company you work for dispose of their old computers? The majority of Irish homeowners, would bring their old computers to local civic amenity centres, give it away to a relative or sell it on to another party.

What {{is wrong with the}} methods currently being used for discarding of our old PCs? With this question in mind, Rits Information Security embarked on a study to highlight the problems home users, and corporate users face when discarding retired PCs. In this paper, Rits Information Security describes research in which a number of hard disks were taken from computers after they had been released for resale on Irish online auction sites. The research that was undertaken involved an analysis of the disks to determine if any information remained on these disks, and whether the information could be easily recovered using commonly available tools and techniques. From this analysis, a number of disks could be traced to specific organisations, including large financial institutions, various consultancy firms, numerous small trade organisation, auctioneers, and insurance brokers.
