40|$|Numerical {{calculation}} {{techniques of}} turbulent shear flows are classified into two categories:one is K-e turbulence {{model and the}} other is large eddy simulation (LES). The standard K-emodel has been established at present to predict turbulent structure in <b>closed</b> <b>duct</b> flows, whileLES is being developed to predict coherent eddy structure in more simple duct flows. Thestandard K-e model cannot be, however, applied to open channel surface flows, because theturbulence near the free surface is more depressed than the <b>closed</b> <b>duct</b> flows. In the present study a new modified K-e model is proposed to predict reasonably the turbulentstructure in open channel flows with both of low and high Reynolds numbers.

Such flows are known to be very sensitive to the effective shape of the container used to host the fluid and its thermal boundary conditions. For the case of temperature gradients having the main component directed along the horizontal direction, related convective phenomena fall under the general heading of “Hadley flow”. Here we introduce a general framework for the determination of the properties of these flows in the case of domains having converging or diverging top and bottom walls. The framework is built via a hybrid approach in which typical techniques of CFD are used in synergy with analytical solutions of the energy equation. The proper use of initial and boundary conditions results in algorithm convergence acceleration.

In the experiments, the nozzle is mounted vertically, with the nozzle exit plane at a height of 73 jet diameters above ground level. Relative to the nozzle exit plane (NEP), {{the location of the}} duct inlet is varied at 10, 5, and - 1 jet diameters. Far-field sound pressure levels were obtained at 54 jet diameters above ground with the aid of acoustic sensors equally spaced around a circular arc of radius equal to 80 jet diameters from the jet axis. Data on the jet acoustic field for the partially open duct were obtained and compared with those with a free jet and with a <b>closed</b> <b>duct.</b> The results suggest that for the partially open duct the overall sound pressure level (OASPL) decreases as the distance between the NEP and the duct inlet plane decreases, while the opposite trend is observed for the <b>closed</b> <b>duct.</b> It is also concluded that the observed peak frequency in the partially open duct increases above the free jet value as the angle from the duct axis is increased, and as the duct inlet plane becomes closer to the NEP...|$|E

This analysis follows and integrates the line of inquiry started in past authors’ work about the typical properties of these flows and associated hierarchy of bifurcations in rectangular geometries. The Navier Stokes and energy equations are solved in their time-dependent and non-linear formulation to investigate the onset and evolution of oscillatory disturbances and other effects breaking the initially unicellular structure of the flow. It is shown that a kaleidoscope of oscillatory patterns is made possible by the new degree of freedom represented by the opposite inclination of the walls with respect to the horizontal direction. Even minute variations in the geometry and/or initial conditions can cause significant changes. Multiple states exist which can replace each other in given sub-regions of the space of parameters. Observed regimes include: stationary convection, weakly oscillating rolls, coalescing rolls, traveling waves, and modulated (pulso-traveling) disturbances.

Measurements included left ventricular fractional shortening, right and left ventricular outputs, colour and pulsed Doppler ductal and atrial shunting and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) derived from ductal shunt or tricuspid incompetence velocities.  RESULTS—The babies were retrospectively classified into a respiratory group (n= 19) and a persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) group (n= 13) {{on the basis of}} clinical history and radiology. At the initial echocardiogram, just 50 % of babies had suprasystemic SPAP. Despite better oxygenation, more of the PPHN group had suprasystemic PAP (85 % vs 26 %). A correlation between SPAP and Oxygen index (OI) was present only in the respiratory group (r= 0. 7). Low ventricular outputs (< 150 ml/kg/min) were common in both groups (53 % and 79 %). The respiratory group had more <b>closed</b> <b>ducts</b> (47 % vs 0 %) and those ducts which were patent were more constricted (1. 75 mm vs 2. 6 mm). Pure right to left ductal shunts were seen in just 15 % and pure right to left atrial shunts in just 6 % of all babies. The serial echocardiograms showed that SPAP fell and <b>ducts</b> <b>closed</b> well before oxygenation improved. Ventricular outputs increased with age in both groups.  CONCLUSIONS—Apart from early on in the sickest babies with a primarily respiratory diagnosis and the babies with primary PPHN, most right to left shunting occurred at an intrapulmonary level. ...|$|R
40|$|The Launch Systems Testbed (LST) {{represents}} {{the evolution of}} vibroacoustics research and development work performed at NASA John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) over the last 15 years. The LST {{is located at the}} Launch Equipment Test Facility (LETF) in the KSC industrial complex. The LETF is operated by Sierra Lobo, Inc., as a member of University-Affiliated Technology Development Contract (USTDC) to KSC Spaceport and Engineering and Technology Directorate (YA), with ASRC Aerospace Corporation as a the prime contractor. Trajectory Simulation Mechanism (TSM) is a major component of the LST, developed specifically to simulate nonstationary acoustic loads on launch pad structures, vehicles, and payloads. TSM enhances the capabilities within LST for simulating launch environments of future vehicles. The scaled launch environments will be used to predict the full-scale launch environment via an appropriate scaling procedure. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) has tasked NASA KSC to perform a basic technology test program in support of developing a low-cost clean pad (incorporating passive mitigation techniques) for future launch vehicles. The overall goal of the program is to develop innovative launch exhaust management systems, which effectively reduce launch acoustic environment with innovative duct designs, while eliminating traditional sound suppression water systems. Passive techniques, such as nontraditional duct geometries, resonators, and diffusers, etc., will be investigated. The overall goals are to advance innovative concepts for a clean pad while developing ideas to reduce transmitted sound via investigation and modeling of jet exhaust acoustic and flow field characteristics. The series of tests outlined in this report represent baseline tests and are geared towards defining the acoustic load environment on the TSM pad for open and <b>closed</b> <b>duct</b> configurations. This report summarizes the cold jet acoustic testing for Mach 2. 5 supersonic nitrogen jet issuing from a nozzle with 1 -inch exit diameter. Acoustic data, including spectral sound power and Overall Sound Pressure Level (OASPL), are obtained both for a free jet and with the jet flowing through a rigid-walled duct with a J-deflector. The relative performance of <b>closed</b> <b>duct</b> and open duct is evaluated. The results show that the <b>closed</b> <b>duct</b> is superior to the partially open duct, and results in about 3 -decibel (dB) noise reduction (near the duct axis) relative to the free jet. The location of the nozzle exit plane (NEP) relative to the duct inlet plane (DIP) has a significant effect on the acoustic field. The results suggest that the location of NEP at 10 inches above the DIP results in reduced acoustic loads relative to 5 inches above the duct inlet and 1 inch into the duct inlet...|$|E

40|$|Determination {{of local}} {{boundary}} shear stress {{is an important}} topic in hydraulic engineering.

This paper presents such a method called the momentum balance method (MBM). A theoretical relationship between the boundary shear stress and parameters of the primary flow region has been established. The results obtained from MBM agree reasonably well with other methods, indicating that the new method is workable in <b>closed</b> <b>duct</b> flows, and possibly its applicability can be extended {{to a wide range of}} boundary conditions...|$|E

The evolved flow and wave pattern due to a collision of an incident shock wave with the door, causing the door opening, is studied by employing a high speed schlieren system and recording pressures at different places inside the tube as well as on the rotating door. Analyzing this data sheds light on the air flow evolution and the behavior of the opening door. In the present work, emphasis is given to understanding the complex, unsteady flow developed behind the transmitted shock wave as it diffracts over the opening door. It is shown that both the door inertia and the shock wave strength influence the opening dynamic evolution, but not in the proportions that might be expected...|$|E

This period also witnessed the construction of rain and spring water gathering ponds {{to be used in}} summer. An illustrative example of such a pond is Suleiman ponds lying near Al-Khader village to the southwest of Bethlehem. The main objective of constructing these ponds in that area was to collect the water of a number of springs which were particularly abundant with water during winter and spring. The ponds got their name from the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman who ordered them to be built. The springs were chosen because of their conspicuous height of 800 [*]m above sea level, which is 63 [*]m higher than the holy Aqsa Mosque of Jerusalem. Thus, water easily flowed to that sanctuary, owing to the difference in altitude, and supplied the mosque with potable and ablution water. These ponds were supervised by officials who were entrusted with their maintenance and protection from pollution. Accordingly, further measures were taken to keep this water source clean. Throwing any dirt around and in the pool, watering livestock there, or doing anything that may cause water quality deterioration was strictly banned.|$|R

A hsPDA decreases cerebral blood flow and oxygen saturation by the ductal steal phenomenon. Aim: To determine the relationship between echocardiographic parameters, cerebral oxygenation and a hsPDA in preterm infants. Methods: 380 preterm infants (2) was continuously monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy during 72 h after birth, and afterwards for at least 1 h before echocardiography. Echocardiographic parameters included ductal diameter, end-diastolic flow in the left pulmonary artery, left atrium/aorta ratio and ductal flow pattern. Results: rScO 2 was significantly related only to ductal diameter over time. Mixed modelling analysed the course of rScO 2 over time, where infants were divided into four groups: a <b>closed</b> <b>duct,</b> an open haemodynamically insignificant duct (non-sPDA), a hsPDA, which was successfully closed during study period (SC hsPDA) or a hsPDA, which was unsuccessfully closed during study period (UC hsPDA). SC hsPDA infants showed the highest rScO 2 on day 6, while UC hsPDA infants had the lowest rScO 2 values. Conclusions: Ductal diameter is the only echocardiographic parameter significantly related to cerebral oxygenation over time. Cerebral oxygenation takes a different course over time depending {{on the status of}} the duct. Low cerebral oxygenation may be suggestive of a hsPDA...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{streaming}} {{is generated}} by Reynolds stress {{in the sense of}} mean acoustic momentum flux in a sound field. In the case of an acoustic standing wave produced by an air column oscillation in a <b>closed</b> <b>duct,</b> the friction and the Reynolds stress in the resulting Stokes layer are the essentials of acoustic streaming generation {{in the vicinity of the}} duct wall. The thickness of the Stokes layer decreases with the oscillatory Reynolds number. The plane wave propagation in the duct is assumed for the case of high Reynolds number except for the thin Stokes layer adjacent to the duct wall. The velocity profiles of the streaming are estimated theoretically from the steady component of the second-order term of a perturbation expansion in which the first-order approximation is a sinusoidal oscillation of the air column with plane waves. The present paper describes theoretical analysis of the velocity profiles of the acoustic streaming in the Stokes layer by means of the matched asymptotic expansion method. The results obtained show the existence of reverse streaming in a very thin layer adjacent to the wall and the effects of thermal boundary conditions at the wall on the velocity profiles of acoustic streaming in the Stokes layer...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of three-dimensional turbulent structure, I. e. cellular secondary currentsor longitudinal vortices, {{is very important}} in hydraulic engineering because these currentscause three-dimensional bed shear stress, sediment distributions and bed configurations suchas sand ridges in straight rivers. The present study has carried out highly accurate measurements of secondary currentsin fully-developed open channel flows by making use of a powerful two-color Laser DopplerAnemometer (LDA) system with a direct digital signal processing. The primary and secon-dary velocity distributions, the maximum-velocity-dip phenomena, the bed and side-wallshear stress distributions and also the turbulence characteristics were made clear by varyingthe aspect ratio of channel. The effects of free surface on three-dimensional structurewere then examined by comparison with the data of <b>closed</b> <b>duct</b> flow. A strong free-surfacevortex is produced due to high an-isotropy of turbulence which is caused by the existenceof free surface. This vortex produces a velocity dip and also restrains the development ofthe bottom vortex. Although the bottom vortex may be divided into smaller ones with anincrease of the aspect ratio, multi-cellular secondary currents are not produced any longerin the central zone. The variation of bed shear stress, however, suggests strongly that multi-cellular secondary currents will be produced in all the cross section by a mutual interactionof the flow and sand ridges...|$|E

40|$|To {{measure a}} flow in a <b>closed</b> <b>duct,</b> {{one of the}} {{available}} methods is to explore the velocity field. With this method, {{the quality of the}} flow measurement is very dependent on the location of the velocity measurement points in the duct section. Recommendations about velocity schemes are proposed in international standards (ISO 3966, ISO 7145, EN 12599 …) for circular and rectangular ducts. These recommendations assume that a turbulent flow profile is established. This requires flow profiler and/or long straight lengths upstream and downstream the measurement section. On site, these recommendations are difficult to apply strictly because conditions of straight lengths are often not available. Secondly, the velocity measurement schemes proposed in standards are often time consuming and users prefer sometimes to simplify them. In this case, the estimation of the measurement error is not known. A numerical study has been carried out to investigate the influence of the velocity measurement scheme on the flow measurement when the distance between disturbances and the measurement section is small in the case of circular and rectangular ducts. The results are presented in term of measurement error according to the shape of the duct, velocity scheme, number of velocity measurements, distance between disturbances and measurement section...|$|E

To determine whether the PDA is hemodynamically significant (HSDA), several echocardiographic parameters have been suggested, including retrograde diastolic blood flow in the descending aorta (Dao). OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the impact of}} an HSDA, including retrograde diastolic flow in the Dao, on regional tissue oxygen saturation (rSO 2) and extraction measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). METHODS: This is a prospective observational cohort study in which we included preterm infants (GA 1. 4 and/or left pulmonary artery end-diastolic flow velocity > 0. 2 m/s and/or retrograde diastolic blood flow in the Dao. RESULTS: Forty-nine infants were included, with a median GA of 27. 6 weeks (IQR: 26. 1 - 29. 0), birth weight of 980 g (IQR: 800 - 1, 200), and postnatal age of 77 h (IQR: 70 - 107). Infants with a <b>closed</b> <b>duct</b> (n = 11), a non-HSDA (n = 18), and an HSDA (n = 20) had similar cerebral and renal NIRS measurements. Retrograde diastolic blood flow in the Dao, present in 11 infants with PDA, also did not affect cerebral and renal NIRS measurements. CONCLUSION: In preterm infants with clinical signs of an HSDA within 2 weeks after birth, cerebral and renal oxygen saturation and extraction are not affected by an HSDA or by retrograde diastolic blood flow in the Dao...|$|E
40|$|Ripple {{formation}} beneath sea waves is analyzed both by {{experimental and}} analytical means when {{the bottom is}} made up of a mixture of sands. An oscillatory flow is obtained in a <b>closed</b> <b>duct</b> by the oscillations of two rigidly connected pistons located at the ends of the duct. The amplitude and period of the oscillations can be continuously varied. A fixed tray, located {{at the bottom of the}} duct and filled with different types of sediments, allows ripple formation to be observed. The presence of graded sediments is found to have a stabilizing effect and causes longer ripples to appear. Moreover a selective sediment transport is observed and quantified which tends to pile up the coarse grains at ripple crests leaving the fine ones in the troughs. As in the companion paper, the theory is based on a linear stability analysis of a flat sandy bottom subject to an oscillatory flow. Because of the presence of a mixture, a modified version of Exner equation is used and an “hiding” factor should be inserted in the sediment transport rate formula. The flow regime in the bottom boundary layer is assumed to be turbulent. The conditions for ripple appearance are determined along with their wavelengths as they form. Good agreement is found between experimental data and theoretical findings...|$|E
