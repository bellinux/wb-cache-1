It was played at <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> in Denver, Colorado, on October 1, 2007. The Rockies won the game 9–8 in thirteen innings on a controversial play at home plate.|$|E
5|$|The Colorado Rockies {{were created}} as an {{expansion}} franchise in 1993 and <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> opened in 1995. The Rockies {{advanced to the}} playoffs that year, but were eliminated in the first round. In 2007, they advanced to the playoffs as a wild-card entrant, won the NL Championship Series, and brought the World Series to Denver {{for the first time}} but were swept in four games by the Boston Red Sox.|$|E
2500|$|In {{its first}} season, Yankee Stadium quickly {{acquired}} {{a reputation as}} a [...] "bandbox" [...] and a [...] "launching pad" [...] because of the high number of home runs hit at the new ballpark. [...] Through its first 23 games, 87 home runs were hit at the venue, easily besting Enron Field's (now called Minute Maid Park) previous record set in 2000. [...] Early in the season, Yankee Stadium was on pace to break <b>Coors</b> <b>Field's</b> 1999 single-season record of 303 home runs allowed, and the hometown Daily News (using the back-page headline [...] "HOMERS ODYSSEY") started publishing a daily graphic comparing each stadium's home run totals through a similar number of games.|$|R

This normally {{would not have been}} a problem due to <b>Coors</b> <b>Field's</b> underground heating system, and the Rockies have played in freezing conditions before. However, MLB began giving serious thought to postponing the game after hearing that the temperature would barely make it above freezing, and reports of icy roads and numerous accidents clinched the decision. This pushed Game 4 back to October 12, with Game 5, if necessary, to be played the next day in Philadelphia with no travel day.|$|R
5|$|On June 19, 2015, in a 9–5 {{win over}} the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium, Posey hit a grand slam and stole a base, {{becoming}} the first Giants catcher in 112 years since Roger Bresnahan to accomplish the feat. Four days later, in a 6–0 {{win over the}} San Diego Padres at AT Park, Posey hit another grand slam. On July 5, 2015, Posey was selected to his third career All-Star Game and was number one in voting for NL catchers. On September 6, 2015, at <b>Coors</b> <b>Field,</b> in a 7–4 win over the Colorado Rockies, Posey hit his 100th career home run.|$|E
5|$|After a May 23 neck surgery, Manning {{could not}} use the Colts' {{facilities}} for practice and workouts due to the NFL lockout. Reluctant to have witnesses to his recovery, he used the Colorado Rockies baseball team's trainers at <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> in Denver. Manning was unable to complete his throwing motion, and his arm strength had significantly diminished. Based on an MRI, doctors told him {{in the late summer}} that he needed spinal fusion surgery and that at his age they could not guarantee his return to the NFL. On September 7, the Colts officially ruled Manning out for the season opener against Houston, ending his consecutive starts streak of 208 games (227 including playoffs); the team signed Kerry Collins out of retirement and named him interim starting quarterback. After seeking other opinions, Manning had the second surgery on September 8.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2008 the Cubs {{won for the}} 10,000th time in {{the history}} of the {{franchise}} on the road against the Colorado Rockies. Like the 9,000th win, the 10,000th win came in a 76 victory at <b>Coors</b> <b>Field.</b> The Cubs were the second franchise to achieve 10,000 regular season wins; the San Francisco Giants/New York Giants were the first. The franchise flew a special 10,000th win flag along with a Cubs Win flag to commemorate the landmark achievement for the franchise. This was unusual not just for the 10,000th win, but also for flying the flag in reference to a road game. The special flag flew from the afternoon of April 24, 2008 until immediately prior to the next home game on April 29, 2008 at 7:05pm against the Milwaukee Brewers. After the flag was taken down, it was autographed by all members of the 2008 Chicago Cubs and auctioned off for charity.|$|E
5|$|Seven Rockies {{pitchers}} {{have started}} on two Opening Days: Kevin Ritz, Darryl Kile, Mike Hampton, Jason Jennings, Aaron Cook, Ubaldo Jiménez, and Jorge De La Rosa. Kile {{has the best}} Opening Day record with twowins and nolosses. Armando Reynoso is the only Rockies pitcher to start on Opening Day in Colorado's former home of Mile High Stadium. Rockies starting pitchers have an Opening Day record of fourwins, twolosses, and one no decision when at home.

25|$|The next {{confrontation}} between the two teams was in 2008, with the Red Wings sweeping the Avalanche 4–0 {{on the way to}} the Stanley Cup. A stadium series game took place on February 27, 2016 between the two teams at <b>Coors</b> <b>Field.</b> The Red Wings won the game 5–3.|$|E
25|$|Citi Field's {{interior}} design is primarily influenced by PNC Park, {{which was the}} favorite ballpark of Mets COO Jeff Wilpon. Other influences include Great American Ball Park, <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> and Citizens Bank Park. Shea Stadium was the only ballpark in the Major Leagues to feature orange foul poles instead of the standard yellow, a unique characteristic that made its way into Citi Field.|$|E
25|$|The {{baseball}} behaves {{differently in}} those stadiums with artificial turf as well. Artificial surfaces are harder and more uniform than grass, {{and the ball}} tends to roll farther and straighter, and to bounce truer and more highly on these fields. Teams built to play {{the majority of their}} games on this field tend to place a higher premium on defence (since it is more likely to get an infield out) and speed (since {{it is more important to}} be able to beat out a throw) than on power hitting. The altitude of the stadium (most notably <b>Coors</b> <b>Field)</b> can also impact the distance a batted ball travels and the amount of ball movement a pitcher can generate with his deliveries, although recently balls have begun being placed in humidors at high-altitude parks to negate these effects. The amount of moisture in the dirt on the basepaths can also affect the behaviour of ground balls and the ease with which players may steal bases; some teams are known to alter the amount of watering done to the dirt depending on the skills of the home and visiting team. The amount of foul territory is also an important variable, since foul pop-ups that would be outs in some parks (e.g. the Oakland Coliseum) may end up in the stands in other parks, thereby allowing the batter to remain at the plate (e.g. Fenway Park and <b>Coors</b> <b>Field).</b> On the whole, though, these variations do not produce effects as great as variations in cricket pitches, with one arguable exception being <b>Coors</b> <b>Field.</b>|$|E
25|$|On August 8, Sunny Kim, another South Korean {{starting}} pitcher {{who had just}} joined the Rockies from the Washington Nationals, and Kim started doubleheader games at <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> against the Florida Marlins. They became the first two pitchers with same last name to start both ends of doubleheader since Gaylord and Jim Perry for the Cleveland Indians in 1974. The Rockies won both games and Kim collected a win.|$|E
25|$|On July 28, 2006, Kim {{had five}} {{consecutive}} strikeouts against the San Diego Padres, tying the Rockies record for consecutive strikeouts. In four different starts, he recorded nine strikeouts each against the Florida Marlins, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Pirates and Washington Nationals. Kim {{became the only}} pitcher in Major League history to pitch shutout wins in consecutive starts at <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> by beating the Oakland Athletics on June 19 and the Texas Rangers on June 25.|$|E
25|$|The Colorado Rockies are an American {{professional}} baseball team based in Denver, Colorado. The Rockies compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) {{as a member}} club of the National League (NL) West division. The team's home venue is <b>Coors</b> <b>Field,</b> located in the Lower Downtown area of Denver. The Rockies won their only National League championship in 2007, after having won 14 of their final 15 games {{in order to secure}} a Wild Card position. In the World Series they were swept by the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox in four games.|$|E
25|$|Dee Gordon {{had three}} hits, {{including}} two triples, in the Dodgers 7–2 {{win over the}} Colorado Rockies at <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> on June 6. He was the first Dodgers player with two triples in a game since Rafael Furcal in 2010. Tim Federowicz hit a three-run homer the next day, but the Dodgers still lost 5-4 in 10 innings on a walk-off triple by Brandon Barnes. The {{final game of the}} Rockies series was called off after 5½ innings because of rain but the Dodgers were credited with a 6–1 win. Clayton Kershaw struck out nine batters in the five innings, becoming the first pitcher in Major League history to record four straight games of exactly nine strikeouts. The game was the Dodgers first regulation game called before nine innings since a 2004 game that was also at <b>Coors</b> <b>Field.</b> Scott Van Slyke hit two home runs and drove in four on June 9 as the Dodgers beat the Cincinnati Reds 6–2 at Great American Ball Park. Josh Beckett threw six shutout innings and the Dodgers racked up 12 hits in a 6–1 win over the Reds after a two-hour rain delay before the second game of the series. The Dodgers struck out 12 times, managed only four hits, and were shut out 5–0 by Johnny Cueto on June 11 and wound up with a series split after dropping a day game the following day, 4–1.|$|E
25|$|The Freeway series {{continued}} {{the next night}} at Angel Stadium, as Jered Weaver held the Dodgers offense in check and the Angels won 4-3. The Angels took the finale to the series, 3-2, thanks to solid pitching by Jason Vargas and an RBI infield single by Chris Nelson. The Dodgers concluded a tough month of May with a game at <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> against the Colorado Rockies. Kershaw pitched seven plus solid innings but Todd Helton two-run homer off closer Brandon League tied {{the game in the}} bottom of the ninth. The Dodgers rallied to score two in the tenth for their first extra inning win of the season, 7-5.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Bob Uecker {{abruptly}} left NBC Sports {{before a}} chance to call the All-Star Game from <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> in Colorado.

Also in 1998, NBC's coverage of the ALCS was the highest rated for any League Championship Series since before the 1994 strike. NBC averaged a 9.4 rating for the six games, which was a 6% increase than the network's coverage of the 1997 NLCS in the same time slot. The rating was 13% more than Fox's ALCS coverage in 1997 and 12% more than NBC's coverage in 1996.|$|E
25|$|On April 29, 2007, Tulowitzki turned {{just the}} 13th unassisted triple play in MLB history, during a 9–7 home victory at <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> over the Atlanta Braves. As of 2009, {{eight of the}} 15 unassisted triple plays {{have been made by}} a shortstop. In the top of the seventh, Tulowitzki caught third baseman Chipper Jones' line drive with the runners moving, then stepped on second base to retire Kelly Johnson and tagged Édgar Rentería – who made no attempt to escape – before he could return to first base. Confused and not realizing what he had done, Tulowitzki went back and tagged second again, then threw the ball to Helton at first, neither of which was necessary.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers next {{traveled}} back to <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> {{to wrap up}} {{the month}} of August with a three-game series against the Rockies. The Dodgers bullpen imploded and they lost the opener 8–1. A rain out on August 30 forced the Dodgers and Rockies to play a day-night doubleheader the following day. In the opener, the Dodgers offense continued to struggle and they were routed again, 7–0. This {{was the first time}} the Rockies had shutout the Dodgers at home since August 27, 2012. In the second game, the Rockies scored five runs off of a shaky Bud Norris in the first inning but came back and won the game on a grand slam homer by Andrew Toles in the eighth inning, 10–8.|$|E
25|$|Beckett {{made his}} Dodgers {{debut in the}} opener of a series against the Colorado Rockies at <b>Coors</b> <b>Field.</b> He allowed 3 runs in 5 innings and struck out 6, but the Dodgers offense was shut out {{completely}} and the bullpen blew up in a 10–0 loss. Kemp injured himself by crashing into the center field wall in the 1st inning and {{had to leave the}} game, Capuano allowed 4 runs in the first and the Dodgers new look offense continued to struggle as they lost 8–4 on August 28. The Dodgers offense finally came alive the next day, jumping to a 10–1 lead thanks to a 2-run homer by Hanley Ramírez, a grand slam by A. J. Ellis and 7 solid innings from Joe Blanton. The bullpen faltered in the seventh and eighth by the Dodgers held on to win 10–8.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers began August {{by making}} a flurry of trades which sent a number of minor leaguers for outfielder Josh Reddick, {{starting}} pitcher Rich Hill and relievers Jesse Chavez and Josh Fields. These moves led to the surprise demotion of outfielder Yasiel Puig to the minors. However, the new look team had trouble in the next series at <b>Coors</b> <b>Field.</b> In the opener, Carlos González was 3-for-5 with two doubles and four RBI as the Colorado Rockies beat the Dodgers 7–3. Rookie Brock Stewart made his second spot start in the next game and was pounded, allowing four home runs and nine runs overall, in a 12–2 loss. They avoided the road sweep thanks to Kenta Maeda pitching 5 solid innings for his 10th win, the 13th Dodger rookie pitcher with double digit wins. Corey Seager tied Hanley Ramírez for the Los Angeles Dodgers single-season record for home runs by a shortstop with his 19th in the 4–2 win.|$|E
25|$|Double-A Springfield Cardinals sensational {{starting}} LH-pitcher Marco Gonzales, the club's , {{a standout}} for his changeup and his command (3-2, 2.33 ERA in 7 G, 38.2 IP, 33 H, 2 HR, 10 W, 46 SO), made {{the long jump}} to make his major league debut on June 25, at <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> against the Colorado Rockies, near {{where he grew up}} in Fort Collins. He pitched five innings, facing 24 batters, giving up seven hits, two walks, a home run, and five runs, while striking out three, including two in the first inning, including NL-batting leader Troy Tulowitski (.353). He doubled in his first at-bat, and scored the game's first run. Leaving after five innings with the team trailing 5-1, the team rallied for five runs over the last three innings, and won the game, 9-6 with Pat Neshek getting his second win of the season. The game was the first for the Cardinals since 1980 to receive four sacrifice flies. Gonzales became the first Cardinals' starter to make his debut without playing at the Triple A level since Cliff Politte in April 1998.|$|E
25|$|Zack Greinke {{allowed only}} two runs (one earned) in eight innings on July 3 at <b>Coors</b> <b>Field</b> and a Juan Uribe RBI {{single in the}} top of the ninth gave the Dodgers a 3–2 win over the Rockies. On the fourth of july, Clayton Kershaw allowed only two hits and no runs in eight innings while {{striking}} out eight in the team's 9-0 win. Dan Haren struck out a season high eight batters on July 5, but also allowed a season high eight runs and 10 hits. The Dodgers scored five runs in the fifth in an attempted comeback but fell one run short in an 8-7 loss. The Dodgers cruised to an 8-2 win in the series finale behind Josh Beckett's five scoreless innings. However, he walked three in the game which ended the Dodgers MLB record streak for consecutive starts with no more than two walks at 39. After the game, the Dodgers learned that they had four players selected to the 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Kershaw and Greinke were selected to the team, the fourth straight selection for Kershaw. Yasiel Puig was voted as a starter by the fan voting and Dee Gordon was selected as a reserve. Hyun-jin Ryu was unable to get out of the third inning as he allowed seven runs on ten hits and the Dodgers were pounded by the Detroit Tigers 14-5 at Comerica Park. Max Scherzer out dueled Greinke in a battle of former Cy Young Award winners and the Dodgers ended their road trip with a 4-1 loss to the Tigers.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals placed starter Stephen Strasburg on the {{paternity}} list on April 24, {{with the}} right-hander anticipating {{the birth of}} his second child, and made Jacob Turner the fourth spring training non-roster invitee (after Guthrie, Albers, and Green) to crack the team's active roster in the month of April. Turner, a right-handed pitcher whose contract was selected from Class-AAA Syracuse, was given the opportunity to start against the Colorado Rockies in the first of a four-game set at <b>Coors</b> <b>Field.</b> Although Turner supplied a quality start, giving up three earned runs over six innings, and left the game with a lead, the Rockies scored five unanswered runs off the Nationals' bullpen for an 8–4 finish. The game ended up being the only one the Nationals lost on their 10-game roadtrip, with their 9–1 run through series visiting the Braves, Mets, and Rockies standing as the best such mark in team history. On April 25, Trea Turner hit for the cycle {{for the first time in}} his career, cracking a two-run home run off Rockies reliever Jordan Lyles in the sixth inning and rounding out his four-hit night with a bases-clearing triple in the seventh inning as the Nationals won a high-scoring 15–12 contest. In an emphatic finish to the trip, on April 27, the Nationals defeated the Rockies 16–5, with the winning margin of 11 runs being supplied entirely in the seventh inning — the most runs the Montreal–Washington franchise had scored in an inning in almost 20 years. Strasburg was also reactivated on April 27 and Grace was optioned back to Class-AAA Syracuse, with Jacob Turner reassigned to the bullpen after his spot start.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{began the}} month of June where they left off in May, losing their fifth {{straight}} game. This time they committed four errors and were pounded by the Colorado Rockies 13–3 at <b>Coors</b> <b>Field.</b> In that game, the Dodgers set a Major League record by having five sons of former Major Leaguers in the lineup {{at the same time}} (Tony Gwynn, Jr., Jerry Hairston, Jr., Iván DeJesús, Jr., Dee Gordon and Scott Van Slyke). It was also the first time a starting infield of four major league sons had ever occurred: first baseman Van Slyke, second baseman Hairston, third baseman De Jesus and shortstop Gordon. The losing streak came to an end the next day, when they got a strong pitching performance from Aaron Harang and some timely hitting, including Bobby Abreu's first homer as a Dodger, in a 6–2 win. However, the Dodgers offense went back into hibernation the next day as they dropped the series finale to the Rockies 3–2. The Dodgers road trip continued on June 4 as they traveled to Citizens Bank Park to open a four-game series against the Philadelphia Phillies. Dee Gordon hit a triple to lead off the ninth against Phillies closer Jonathan Papelbon and then scored on a single by Elián Herrera to give the Dodgers the winning margin in the 4–3 victory. Herrera came through the next night as well, hitting a two-RBI double off Cliff Lee {{in the top of the}} eighth to give the Dodgers the go-ahead run in a 2–1 victory over the Phillies. Dee Gordon delivered a two-run single during the Dodgers three-run sixth inning on June 6 as they again came from behind to beat the Phillies, this time by a score of 6-5. Kenley Jansen picked up his third save in three days against the Phillies. The Dodgers, helped by three Phillies errors, swept the series with an 8–3 victory in the series finale. The victory was the 100th career win for pitcher Aaron Harang and the team's first ever four-game series sweep in Philadelphia. The Dodgers continued the lengthy road trip with a cross-country flight to Seattle to take on the Mariners in interleague play. In the opener Nathan Eovaldi pitched six scoreless innings before the Mariners got a run off of relief pitcher Scott Elbert. It was all they needed because Kevin Millwood and five relief pitchers combined to pitch a no-hitter against the Dodgers. This was the first official no-hitter against the Dodgers since Kent Mercker of the Atlanta Braves had done it on April 4, 1994. The Dodgers got back into the winning ways the next day as Clayton Kershaw stuck out a season high 12 batters in 7 innings and Jerry Hairston, Jr. hit a home run and had 5 RBI in the 8–3 win. Andre Ethier hit his fourth career grand slam to back Chad Billingsley's strong effort as the Dodgers closed out the lengthy road trip with an 8–2 victory over the Mariners. Billingsley allowed only one run in 7 innings while striking out 8.|$|E
