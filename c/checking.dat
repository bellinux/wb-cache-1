The <b>Check</b> Clearing for the 21 st Century Act of 2003 (<b>Check</b> 21) was intended to make <b>check</b> collection more efficient and less costly by facilitating wider use of electronic <b>check</b> processing. It authorized a new legal instrument [...] the substitute <b>check</b> [...] a paper copy of an image of the front and back of the original <b>check.</b> <b>Check</b> 21 facilitated electronic <b>check</b> processing by allowing banks to use electronic imaging technology for collection and create substitute <b>checks</b> from those images for delivery to banks that do not accept <b>checks</b> electronically. <b>Check</b> 21 mandated that GAO evaluate the implementation and administration of the act. The report objectives are to (1) determine the gains in economic efficiency from <b>check</b> truncation and evaluate the benefits and costs to the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and financial institutions; (2) assess consumer acceptance of the <b>check</b> truncation process resulting from <b>Check</b> 21; and (3) evaluate the benefits and costs to bank consumers from <b>check</b> truncation.
