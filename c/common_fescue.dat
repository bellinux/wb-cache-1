It is native to western North America from British Columbia to Colorado and New Mexico to Baja California, where it grows in many types of open habitat, {{including}} grasslands. It is dominant on some grasslands of California, and it was probably an abundant native grass before the habitat was altered by invasive non-native grasses. It occurs on serpentine soils with associates such as serpentine reedgrass (Calamagrostis ophitidis). It is also known from parts of South America. It is an annual grass producing one stem or a clump of several stems growing up to 75 centimeters tall. The inflorescence has several open branches bearing clusters of purple-tinged spikelets. The spikelet has 1 to 6 flowers. The grass is usually cleistogamous, its flowers fertilizing themselves.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to 1) evaluate the establishment and peak standing crop of Berber Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata var. "Berber"), Palestine Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata var. "Palestine"), and Sheep Fescue (Festuca ovina var. "Covar"); 2) to assess establishment and production changes resulting from environmental gradients (elevation, slope, aspect, soil texture, precipitation, and resident annual community) across the foothill landscape; 3) develop a mathematical model that predicts site potential for restoration; and 4) evaluate the utility of Geographic Information Systems for creation and analysis of spatial data which identify site production potential. Sixteen sites were chosen which reflect the general character of the foothill rangelands in southwestern Oregon. A Randomized Complete Block design was used to select treatment arrangement on each site. Seeded treatments received both chemical (Glyphosate, Hoelon, and 2, 4 -D) and mechanical (residue removal) disturbance. Test species were seeded into three replications at each site. Each replication also included a non-treatment control. Standing crop data for test species and resident exotics were collected after three growing seasons. Berber orchardgrass did not establish at most sites and where establishment did take place production was less than 132 kgDM/ha. Palestine orchardgrass established on on {{a majority of the}} study sites and produced most aboveground phytomass at mid-elevations where coarser soil textures and deeper soil depths were <b>common.</b> Sheep <b>fescue</b> was the most successful of the three test species and did best on low elevation high clay sites. There was significantly (P= 0. 001) more phytomass produced by annual exotics on seeded plots than on undisturbed controls at most sites. Both Palestine orchardgrass and sheep fescue treatments significantly suppressed the annual exotics when compared to the Berber treatments. Generally, "Covar" sheep fescue can establish and successfully compete with exotics on heavier textured soils at low elevations. "Palestine orchardgrass is adapted to mid-elevation coarser soils...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{horizontal}} {{gene transfer}} has brought an active nuclear gene, PgiC 2, from a polyploid Poa species (P. palustris or a close relative) into the <b>common</b> grass sheep’s <b>fescue</b> (Festuca ovina). The donor and the receptor species are strictly reproductively separated, and PgiC 2 {{occurs in a}} polymorphic state within F. ovina. The active gene copy is normally closely linked to a very similar pseudogene. Methodology/Principal Findings: By genome walking we have obtained the up- and downstream sequences of PgiC 2 and of corresponding genes in the donor and recipient species. Comparisons of these sequences show that the complete upstream region necessary for the gene’s expression {{is included in the}} transferred segment. About 1 kb upstream of PgiC 2 a fragment with transposition associated properties has been found (TAF). It is present in P. palustris and its polyploid relatives, though not at the homologous position, and is absent from many other grasses, including non-transgenic F. ovina plants. It is possible that it is a part of a transposing element involved in getting the gene into a transferring agent and/or into the recipient chromosome. Conclusions/Significance: The close similarity of the up- and downstream regions with the corresponding regions in P. palustris excludes all suggestions that PgiC 2 is not a HGT but the result of a duplication within the F. ovina lineage. The small size of the genetic material transferred, the complex nature of the PgiC 2 locus, and the associated fragment with transposition...|$|R
40|$|Objective Four {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (LAB) strains isolated from <b>common</b> vetch, tall <b>fescue</b> and perennial ryegrass on the Tibetan Plateau were characterized, and their effects on the fermentation quality of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) silage were studied. Methods The four isolated strains and one commercial inoculant (G, Lactobacillus plantarum MTD- 1) were evaluated using the acid production ability test, morphological observation, Gram staining, physiological, biochemical and acid tolerance tests. The five LAB strains were added to Italian ryegrass for ensiling at three different temperatures (10 °C, 15 °C, and 25 °C). Results All isolated strains (LCG 3, LTG 7, I 5, and LI 3) could grow at 5 °C to 20 °C, pH 3. 0 to 8. 0 and NaCl (3. 0 %, 6. 5 %). Strains LCG 3, LTG 7, I 5, and LI 3 were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactobacillus paraplantarum, and Lactobacillus casei by sequencing 16 S rDNA, respectively. All LAB inoculants significantly (p< 0. 05) increased lactic acid (LA) contents and ratios of lactic acid to acetic acid, and reduced pH and ammonia nitrogen/total nitrogen (AN/TN) compared with uninoculated silages at various temperatures (10 °C, 15 °C, and 25 °C). Compared to the commercial inoculant G, I 5, and LI 3 showed similar effects on improving the silage quality of Italian ryegrass at 10 °C and 15 °C, indicated by similar pH, LA content and AN/TN. Conclusion All inoculants could improve the silage fermentation quality at various temperatures (10 °C, 15 °C, and 25 °C). At the temperature of 10 °C and 15 °C, strain I 5 and LI 3 had similar effects with the commercial inoculant G on improving the silage quality of Italian ryegrass...|$|R
40|$|Seed accessions from 7 plant {{families}} and 28 species stored for above 20 {{years in the}} National gene bank of Bulgaria were evaluated. All seed accessions were maintained as base collection under long-term storage conditions with low moisture contents (5 ± 2 %) in hermetically closed containers at − 18 °C. On the basis of experimental data, the seed storage characters σ (standard deviation of seed death in storage), P 50 % (the time for viability to fall to 50 %) and P 10 % (the time for viability reduction of 10 %) were determined allowing the prediction of seed storage life and the regeneration needs. The results showed significant differences in loss of seed viability among species and within the species. After 20 – 24 years of storage, eleven crops showed minimal viability decline under 5 % {{as compared to the}} initial viability (oats, barley, maize, bread wheat, durum wheat, smooth brome grass, faba bean, chickpea, sunflower, cucumber and pepper). For the same storage time, another group of crops (sorghum, triticale, orchard grass, tall <b>fescue,</b> <b>common</b> vetch, grass pea, lentil, common bean, rapeseed, tobacco, flax, cabbage and tomatoes) presented 5 – 10 % reduction of seed viability. More significant changes in seed viability – above 10 % – were detected for peanuts, lettuce, soybean and rye. The σ values varied from 20. 41 years (Arachis hypogaea L.) to 500 years (for Avena sativa L. and Triticum aestivum L). There was wide variation across species, both in time taken for the viability to fall to 50 % and in time taken for the seed viability reduction of 10 %. The study illustrates the positive effect of both seed storability early monitoring and prediction of regeneration needs as a tool for limiting undesired losses...|$|R
40|$|V prvem delu raziskave je bil namen ugotoviti sestavo zeli in njihovo neto energijsko vrednost za laktacijo (NEL) glede na staranje. Na trajnem nižinskem travinju v Blatni Brezovici in Murskih Črncih smo zbrali vzorce sedmih vrst zeli: navadni rman (Achillea millefolium L.), ozkolistni trpotec (Plantago lanceolata L), navadna lakota (Gallium mollugo L.), plazeča zlatica (Ranunculus repens L.), gomoljasta zlatica (Ranunculus bulbosus L), navadni regrat (Taraxacum officinale F. Weber) in topolistna kislica (Rumex obtusifolus L.). Ugotovili smo, da pufrska sposobnost pri navadnem rmanu in ozkolistnem trpotcu narašča s staranjem rastlin ob vseh treh oziroma štirih košnjah. Vsebnost vodotopnih ogljikovih hidratov (VOH) se je ob prvi košnji najmanj spreminjala pri navadnem rmanu (+ 12 g VOH kg- 1 suhe snovi (SS) dnevno v Murskih Črncih) in ozkolistnem trpotcu (– 0, 11 g kg- 1 SS dnevno v Murskih Črncih). Največje zmanjševanje VOH s staranjem smo ugotovili pri topolistni kislici (– 3, 40 g VOH kg- 1 SS dnevno). Vsebnost surovih maščob (SM) se je ob prvi košnji najhitreje zmanjševala pri navadnem regratu (– 0, 54 oziroma – 0, 75 g SM kg- 1 SS dnevno). Najmanj surovih beljakovin (SB) smo ugotovili v rastlinah iz družine zlatičnic (88 do 162 g SB kg- 1 SS). Surova vlaknina (SVl) je najhitreje naraščala pri gomoljasti zlatici (4, 31 g SVl kg- 1 SS dnevno), najpočasneje pa pri navadnem regratu (0, 29 oziroma 0, 50 g SVl kg- 1 SS dnevno). Največjo vsebnost NEL ob prvi košnji smo določili v plazeči zlatici (6, 73 – 7, 38 MJ NEL kg- 1 SS), najmanjšo maja pri navadnem rmanu (4, 36 – 6, 29 MJ NEL kg- 1 SS) in topolistni kislici (4, 50 – 5, 41 MJ NEL kg- 1 SS). Vsebnost NEL se je najhitreje zmanjševala pri navadnem rmanu in gomoljasti zlatici (– 0, 05 MJ NEL kg- 1 SS dnevno), najpočasneje pa pri ozkolistnem trpotcu in plazeči zlatici (– 0, 01 MJ NEL kg- 1 SS dnevno). V drugem delu raziskave nas je zanimala silirna sposobnost navadnega rmana in ozkolistnega trpotca v primerjavi z mnogocvetno ljuljko (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) in travniško bilnico (Festuca pratensis L.), pa tudi vpliv 10 in 30 % deleža omenjenih zeli v mešanici na kakovost fermentacije omenjenih silaž. Hkrati smo proučevali vpliv venenja na kakovost fermentacije in na vsebnost β-karotena v silažah. S podaljševanjem časa venenja in omejeno fermentacijo se je pH-vrednost zelo uvelih silaž razen mnogocvetne ljuljke zmanjšala manj kakor pH-vrednost neuvelih ali uvelih silaž (p < 0, 05). Neuvele in uvele silaže mnogocvetne ljuljke so bile slabše kakovosti od silaž travniške bilnice, navadnega rmana, ozkolistnega trpotca ali mešanice travniške bilnice z 10 - ali 30 -odstotnim deležem zeli. Povezave med vsebnostjo β-karotena in drugimi produkti fermentacije so razen povezave s pH-vrednostjo in BK šibke, vendar statistično značilne (p < 0, 05). Ugotavljamo, da rastlinska vrsta in venenje (p < 0, 001), pa tudi njun interakcija (p < 0, 01) vplivajo na vsebnost β-karotena v silaži. Mnogocvetna ljuljka in travniška bilnica vsebujeta v sveži snovi in tudi v silažah več β-karotena v primerjavi z ozkolistnim trpotcem ali navadnim rmanom. Največje izgube β-karotena smo ugotovili v zelo uvelih silažah navadnega rmana (– 56, 7 %) in ozkolistnega trpotca (51, 1 %), precej manjše pa v silaži mnogocvetne ljuljke (48, 4 %) in travniške bilnice (37, 0 %). Primerjava izgub β-karotena med venenjem in siliranjem trav in zeli kaže, da so izgube med venenjem večje kakor med siliranjem. Rezultati kažejo, da se, razen pri travniški bilnici, največ β-karotena izgubi v prvih 24 urah venenja. The aim of {{the first}} part of the study was to {{determine}} the composition and net energy value for lactation (NEL) of selected forbs in dependence of ageing. On a permanent lowland grasslands in Blatna Brezovica and Murski Črnci we have collected seven forb species: common yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.), ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata L), Italian ryegrass (Gallium mollugo L.), creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens L.), bulbous buttercup (Ranunculus bulbosus L), common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale F. Weber) and broad leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolus L.). The results show, that the buffering capacity (BK) in common yarrow and ribwort plantain increased with the aging of plants during all harvests. The concentration of water soluble carbohydrates (VOH) at the first cut changed the least in common yarrow (+ 12 g VOH kg- 1 of dry matter (DM) per day in Murski Črnci) and ribwort plantain (- 0. 11 g VOH kg- 1 of DM per day in Murski Črnci). The largest reduction of VOH with aging was found in broad leaved dock (- 3. 40 g VOH kg- 1 of DM per day). Crude fat (SM) content at the first cut declined the most rapidly in common dandelion (- 0. 54 and - 0. 75 g SM kg- 1 of DM per day). A minimum crude protein (CP) content was found in plants from the buttercup family (88 to 162 g SB kg- 1 of DM). Crude fiber (CF) content has increased the most rapidly in the bulbous buttercup (4. 31 g CF kg- 1 of DM per day) and the slowest in the common dandelion (0. 29 and 0. 50 g CF kg- 1 of DM per day). The highest content of NEL at the first cut was determined in creeping buttercup (6. 73 to 7. 38 MJ NEL kg- 1 of DM), while the lowest content of NEL was found in common yarrow (4. 36 – 6, 29 MJ NEL kg- 1 of DM) and broad leaved dock (4. 50 – 5, 41 MJ NEL kg- 1 of DM). The NEL value declined the fastest in common yarrow and bulbous buttercup (- 0. 05 MJ NEL kg- 1 of DM per day, respectively) and the slowest in ribwort plantain and creeping buttercup (- 0. 01 MJ NEL kg- 1 DM per day). In the second experiment we have studied the ensiling capacity and the quality of silages from common yarrow and ribwort plantain in comparison to Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis L.), as well as the influence of 10 and 30 % addition of the above mentioned herbs on the quality of the silage fermentation. We also studied the influence of wilting on the fermentation quality and the content of β-carotene in silages. With increasing time of wilting and reduced fermentation activity, the pH value in highly-wilted silages, with the exception of Italian ryegrass, decreased to a lesser extent than the pH value in un-wilted or wilted silages (P< 0. 05). The un-wilted and wilted silages of Italian ryegrass were of lower quality than silages made of meadow <b>fescue,</b> <b>common</b> yarrow, ribwort plantain or silages from a mixture of meadow fescue with addition of 10 or 30 % of forbs. The correlations between the content of β-carotene and other fermentation products, with the exception of the correlation of pH value with the BK, were relatively weak but statistically significant (P < 0. 05). We have noted that the plant species and wilting (P < 0. 001), as well as their interaction (P < 0. 01), influenced the content of β-carotene in the silage. Italian ryegrass and meadow fescue contained more β-carotene in the fresh material as well as in silages, in comparison to the ribwort plantain and common yarrow. The largest loss of β-carotene was observed in a highly-wilted silages of common yarrow (- 56. 7 %) and ribwort plantain (- 51. 1 %), whereas the losses were considerably lower in the silage of Italian ryegrass (- 48. 4 %) and meadow fescue (- 37. 0 %). Comparison of losses of β-carotene as a consequence of wilting and ensiling of grasses and herbs shows, that the loss of β-carotene due to wilting is greater than the one caused by ensiling. The results show that, with the exception of meadow fescue, the β-carotene losses are largest during the first 24 hours of wilting...|$|R
