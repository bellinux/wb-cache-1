50|$|The {{state has}} a <b>current</b> <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> of over 14,000 MW. The highest peak demand for {{electricity}} in Queensland for which data is currently available was 8,891 MW and occurred on 18 January 2010. Queensland's resources sector creates a strong demand for electricity at mines, smelters and refineries, which are often located in regional Queensland. Two interconnectors between Queensland and New South Wales allow the state to export power south. The first was the Terranora interconnector, commissioned in 2000. The second to be commissioned was the Queensland - New South Wales Interconnector (QNI) in early 2001. The QNI initially had a capacity of 300 MW. With improvements to the electricity systems at either end, the capacity has more than doubled, and currently Queensland can export up to 1380 MW of electricity, or import up to 880 MW. More than 75% of the additional generating capacity built since {{the creation of the}} National Electricity Market (NEM) is in Queensland, explaining the relatively large difference between the state's generating capacity and demand.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} energy cogeneration effect of bagasse in the South African sugar industry. At {{the present moment}} very few sugar mills are exporting surplus electricity generated to the national grid. There {{is a need to}} take advantage of the abundant bagasse that is produced from the sugar industry through more efficient combustion processes to co-generate process steam and electricity for the supply to the grid. The industry also needs to take advantage of available technologies to efficiently generate electricity from bagasse using high pressure steam boilers. Using the current available technology the industry has a potential to produce about 3000 GWh per year and this is about 1. 3 % of the <b>current</b> <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> in South Africa. This translates to a generating capacity of 343 MW. Application of Integrated gasification combined cycle can result in 11000 GWh and this is about 5 % of the <b>current</b> <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> at Eskom. In terms of MW this is equivalent to a generating capacity of 1255 MW. The other benefit derived from cogeneration is the 1. 619 kilo tonnes reduction in the use of coal which also translates to 2. 84 Mt of carbon dioxide. The cogeneration project will also improve the competitiveness of the sugar industry provided a viable price per KWh of electricity is agreed upon...|$|E

The <b>current</b> <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> of hydropower projects in Nepal is about 600 MW. Despite adequate availability of surface water, several water resources projects have not been yielding expected output primarily due to sedimentation problems, which were underestimated at design stage {{in most of the}} cases.

To understand the electrochemical characterization of these microarrayed electrodes, Cyclic Voltammetry experiments have been conducted using histidine buffer solution. Further tests have been carried out under similar conditions using (a) 2 D planar metal microarrays fabricated through liftoff process that have similar layout to that of 3 D Carbon microarrays and (b) C-MEMS fabricated 3 D Carbon microarrays for comparing their abilities in terms of electrochemical behavior.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) relied on its 11 coal-burning plants to supply 60 percent of its electric power in fiscal year 2001. These plants account for almost all of TVA's emissions of two key air pollutants [...] sulfur dioxide (SO 2), which {{has been linked to}} reduced visibility, and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which contribute to the formation of harmful ozone. To meet an increase in demand of 1. 7 percent annually through 2010, TVA estimates that it will need to expand its <b>current</b> <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> of 30, 365 megawatts by 500 megawatts annually. Building new generating capacity can produce more emissions, which raises environment concerns. To lessen the need for new capacity, TVA and other electricity suppliers promote the efficient use of electricity through "demand-side management" programs, which seek {{to reduce the amount of}} energy consumed or to change the time of day when it is consumed. Even though TVA intends to increase its capacity to generate electricity through 2005, it also expects to reduce its SO 2 and NOx emissions during the same time period, primarily by burning lower-sulfur coal, installing devices to control emissions at its existing plants, and relying on fuels other than coal for new capacity. Although TVA's demand-side management programs have allowed customers to cut their electrical consumption, these programs have made only modest contributions to reducing peak-time demand. TVA has limited the scope of its key program to reduce peak-time consumption by residential customers because TVA believes the program is not cost-effective. TVA projects that its demand-side programs will produce nearly twice as much in savings between 2001 and 2005 as was achieved in the previous five years. Other large utilities have more fully implemented the types of programs that TVA now has in place and have also implemented a greater array of demand-side management tools. These programs have involved a much higher proportion of their residential customers and established different prices for electricity used during different times of the day. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. In South Africa, {{electrical}} energy is taken for granted. The low electricity price has helped electricity intensive industries to be competitive. Unfortunately {{it has also}} prevented industries to become energy efficient. During the National Electrification Programme, more than 3. 1 million homes were supplied with electricity. This has mainly increased the peak demand for electricity supplied by Eskom. Projections show that peak demand will be higher than Eskom's <b>current</b> <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> by as early as 2007. In order to curb this growth in electricity demand, Eskom launched a Demand Side Management programme in accordance with regulations drawn up by the Department of Minerals and Energy and the National Energy Regulator. The main purpose for this programme is to reduce {{electrical energy}} usage during evening peak demand times, {{as well as to}} encourage an energy efficient society. One way of implementing this evening peak reduction is to shift the load to other times of the day. An inherent problem with this method is the possible increase of an electrical energy user's maximum demand. Such an increase could incur additional costs to an electricity user. In order to limit this maximum demand, certain systems could be shut down when the electrical energy use {{is on the verge of}} reaching peak levels. It will be shown that rock winders are the most suitable of all the systems used on a mine to manage the maximum demand. All underground mines make use of winders to extract excavated ore. Winder motors are usually large electrical energy consumers. As such, they provide an efficient and fast means of limiting the maximum demand. It is intended to switch off winder motors whenever the overall electricity demand of the mine reaches a peak level - as long as production is not influenced. This system was successfully implemented at AngloGold Ashanti's Kopanang gold mine in South Africa. During the first month of installation, the system managed the mine's maximum demand at a level of 88 MVA. A calculated annual saving of R 137 000 was achieved, with a maximum potential saving of R 349 000. This research showed that rock winders can be successfully used to manage a mine's maximum demand. It can be implemented on most deep level mines that use rock winders. Suitable sites include gold, platinum and diamond mines. Master...|$|E

Methods: Lung function and respiratory muscle pressure <b>generating</b> <b>capacity</b> were measured at first mobilization, at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation {{and one year}} after discharge. Lung function was measured in all 109 subjects, and 55 of these performed additional measurements of respiratory muscle pressure <b>generating</b> <b>capacity.</b> Trajectories of respiratory muscle function for different lesion level groups were assessed by multi-variate multi-level regression models.
