25|$|Marton Depot {{was built}} in 1901 to {{accommodate}} 50 trams. It was used for central routes but declined in use after the closure in 1936 of the Layton and <b>Central</b> <b>Drive</b> sections. It closed for tram use between 1939 and 1944 due to the war and accommodated aircraft of the Vickers Aircraft Company. It closed on 11 March 1963, with the last car to leave being Standard car 48.

25|$|In the 1930s manager Walter Luff, {{as part of}} {{a five-year}} plan for modernisation, {{introduced}} a fleet of modern streamlined tramcars including the English Electric double-deck Luxury Dreadnoughts (later known as 'Balloons') and single-deck open-topped Open Boats and enclosed Railcoaches. These formed the backbone of the fleet into the 21st century. In 1936 route closures began with the <b>Central</b> <b>Drive</b> and Layton routes. Lytham Road closed in 1961, Marton in 1962 and the tramroad line on Dickson Road to North Station in 1963. Marton and Copse Road Depots closed in 1963 and Bispham Depot in 1966. This left the line from Starr Gate to Fleetwood, which remains. Blackpool Borough Council transferred the operation of the tramway and buses to Blackpool Transport Services Limited in 1986.|$|E

500|$|The {{northern}} diversion {{was easily}} overcome, {{and failed to}} confuse the Australians into committing their reserves, while the <b>central</b> <b>drive</b> was launched too early– in fact {{the day before the}} assault was scheduled to begin– consequently undermining Japanese attempts to achieve sufficient weight of forces to overcome the defenders. The seaborne landing also suffered a significant setback when {{more than half of the}} seven landing craft were destroyed by PT-128 and PT-194 on the night of 8/9 October while on their way to the landing beach. They subsequently suffered heavy casualties during the assault around the beach, with US and Australian troops there mounting a stubborn defence. The beach was guarded by a Bofors 40 mm gun of the 10th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery, 2-pounder anti-tank guns and machine guns of the 2/28th, and two 37 mm guns and two [...]50-calibre machine guns manned by the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment. One of the [...]50 calibre machine guns, manned by Private Nathan van Noy, assisted by Corporal Stephen Popa, engaged a group of Japanese led by a bugler and two men with flame-throwers. A Japanese hand grenade landed in their weapon pit, shattering one of van Noy's legs and wounding Popa, but they continued to fire. Another Japanese grenade silenced them. Van Noy was subsequently awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E

40|$|Essential hypertension, insulin resistance, heart failure, congestion, {{diuretic}} resistance, {{and functional}} renal disease are all characterized by excessive <b>central</b> sympathetic <b>drive.</b> The {{contribution of the}} kidney’s somatic afferent nerves, as an underlying cause of elevated <b>central</b> sympathetic <b>drive,</b> {{and the consequences of}} excessive efferent sympathetic signals to the kidney itself, as well as other organs, identify the renal sympathetic nerves as a uniquely logical therapeutic target for diseases linked by excessive <b>central</b> sympathetic <b>drive.</b> Clinical studies of renal denervation in patients with resistant hypertension using an endovascular radiofrequency ablation methodology have exposed the sympathetic link between these conditions. Renal denervation could be expected to simultaneously affect blood pressure, insulin resistance, sleep disorders, congestion in heart failure, cardiorenal syndrome and diuretic resistance. The striking epidemiologic evidence for coexistence of these disorders suggests common causal pathways. Chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system has been associated with components of the metabolic syndrome, such as blood pressure elevation, obesity, dyslipidemia, and impaired fasting glucose with hyperinsulinemia. Over 50 % of patients with essential hypertension are hyperinsulinemic, regardless of whether they are untreated or in a stable program of treatment. Insulin resistance is related to sympathetic drive via a bidirectional mechanism. In this manuscript, we review the data that suggests that selective impairment of renal somatic afferent and sympathetic efferent nerves in patients with resistant hypertension both reduces markers of <b>central</b> sympathetic <b>drive</b> and favorably impacts diseases linked through central sympathetics—insulin resistance, heart failure, congestion, diuretic resistance, and cardiorenal disorders...|$|R

2500|$|The <b>central</b> <b>drive</b> shaft, {{called the}} [...] "eccentric shaft" [...] or [...] "E-shaft", {{passes through the}} center of the rotor and is {{supported}} by fixed bearings. The rotors ride on eccentrics (analogous to crankpins) integral to the eccentric shaft (analogous to a crankshaft). The rotors both rotate around the eccentrics and make orbital revolutions around the eccentric shaft. Seals at the corners of the rotor seal against the periphery of the housing, dividing it into three moving combustion chambers. The rotation of each rotor on its own axis is caused and controlled by a pair of synchronizing gears A fixed gear mounted on one side of the rotor housing engages a ring gear attached to the rotor and ensures the rotor moves exactly 1/3 turn for each turn of the eccentric shaft. The power output of the engine is not transmitted through the synchronizing gears. The force of gas pressure on the rotor (to a first approximation) goes directly to the center of the eccentric part of the output shaft...|$|E

2500|$|Allison Keene of Collider.com {{awarded the}} season 3 stars out of 5 {{after seeing the}} first six episodes. She called the season [...] "a confused, choppy mix of the supernatural seen {{through the lens of}} {{business}} casual... Despite a very good cast and a great origin story, Iron Fist is predictable, a little hammy, and has no real sense of how to tell a cohesive story. As such, it has a few moments that are great and many that are not." [...] Keene also noted the [...] "glacial pace forces plot points and character interactions to be drawn out to a ludicrous degree. Even when things do pick up from there, the editing is choppy, the narrative doesn’t connect particularly well, and Danny’s personality and decision making abilities are split somewhere between an adult man and a 12-year-old boy (which is no real fault of Jones’ — he comes off as charming). It leaves the show with a lot of moving parts and a lot of potential, but ultimately without a <b>central</b> <b>drive</b> or clear motivations." [...] Keene agreed with Fienberg on the lack of villain the season presented as well as, [...] "a very awkwardly shoe-horned Claire Temple", noting at this point it is [...] "less and less believable as each show wears on that the eventual Defenders haven’t run into each other, or that these connecting characters don’t bother mentioning other supers they know [...]" [...] She concluded that instead of presenting [...] "what could have been the boldest" [...] of the Marvel Netflix series, it instead [...] "doubled-down on the problems" [...] the other series had instead of learning from them.|$|E

40|$|<b>Central</b> {{respiratory}} <b>drive</b> was {{studied in}} 13 piglets {{of both sexes}} varying in age from 19 to 67 days. The distal trachea was cannulated and the maximum rate of isometric inspiratory pressure change (dP/dt) max, was measured at the airway. Curves were constructed relating this measurement to changes in arterial PCO 2 during carbon dioxide rebreathing. Data were obtained at intervals corresponding to stepwise reductions in <b>central</b> respiratory <b>drive</b> produced by added chloralose anaesthesia. Laryngeal reflex activation was achieved by electrical stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerves (SLN). This caused permanent respiratory arrest at a critical level of central respiratory depression expressed as {{the slope of the}} curve relating (dP!dt) max to arterial PCO 2. Severely anemic piglets showed markedly decreased <b>central</b> respiratory <b>drive</b> at a given dose of anesthesia compared to controls. This was consistent with the observed greater sensitivity to laryngeal nerve stimulation in these animals. It is concluded that anemia may be associated with impaired functional maturation of central respiratory mechanisms and consequent susceptibility to laryngeal reflex apnea and asphyxial death. These observations may pertain to factors associated with the sudden infant death syndrome. There is increasing evidence to support the notion that the sudden infant death syndrome is caused by respiratory arrest and asphyxia [1, 2, 3]. Hence, factors whic...|$|R
