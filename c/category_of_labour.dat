As {{many of the}} islands' {{young men}} had joined the armed forces at the outbreak of war, there was a shortfall in manual labour on the farms, particularly for the potato crop. 150 registered conscientious objectors associated with the Peace Pledge Union and 456 Irish workers were recruited for Jersey. Some chose to remain and were trapped by the occupation. Some of the conscientious objectors were communists and regarded the German-Soviet pact as a justification for working for the Germans. Others participated in non-violent resistance activities. As the Irish workers were citizens of a neutral country (see Irish neutrality during World War II), they were free {{to work for the}} Germans as they wished and many did so. The Germans attempted to foster anti-British and IRA sympathies with propaganda events aimed at the Irish (see also Irish Republican Army - Abwehr collaboration in World War II). John Francis Reilly convinced 72 of his fellow Irishmen in 1942 to volunteer for employment at the Hermann Göring ironworks near Brunswick. Conditions were unpleasant and they returned to Jersey in 1943. Reilly stayed behind in Germany to broadcast on radio and joined the SS Sicherheitsdienst. The Channel Islands were amongst the most heavily fortified parts of the Atlantic Wall, particularly Alderney which is the closest to France. On 20 October 1941 Hitler signed a directive, against the advice of Commander-in-Chief von Witzleben, to turn the Channel Islands into an [...] "impregnable fortress". In the course of 1942, one twelfth of the resources funnelled into the whole Atlantic Wall was dedicated to the fortification of the Channel Islands. Hitler had decreed that 10% of the steel and concrete used in the Atlantic Wall go to the Channel Islands. It is often said the Channel Islands were better defended than the Normandy beaches, given the large number of tunnels and bunkers around the islands. By 1944 in tunneling alone, 244,000 m3 of rock had been extracted collectively from Guernsey, Jersey and Alderney (the majority from Jersey). At the same point in 1944 the entire Atlantic Wall from Norway to the Franco-Spanish border, excluding the Channel Islands, had extracted some 225,000 m3.|$|E

Each chapter develops a central Marxist theme; the continuing centrality of work; class and classification; commodity fetishism and primitive accumulation; labour movements {{and the way in}} which labour moves; unemployment, subjectivity and class consciousness, and the new forms of resistance developed in Europe, Latin America and East Asia.

I As a result of the transformations and metamorphoses of the last decades, in particular in the developed capitalist countries and with significant repercussions in third world countries with intermediary industrialisation, labour presents a multiple process. On the one hand, we see a de-proletarianisation of industrial labour in the capitalist developed countries. In other words there has been a reduction of the traditional industrial labour class. In parallel, on the other hand there is a significant underproletarianisation of labour occurring in the diverse forms of partial, precarious, casual, subcontracted labour attached to the manufacturing industries, to the informal economy and to the private sector. Therefore, one can see a significant heterogeneity, complexity and fragmentation of labour. Empirical evidence from various research studies has not supported the thesis of the suppression or elimination of the working class under capitalism, especially in view of the increase of multiple forms of casual or precarious labour.

By repeatedly interrupting of narration, the assemblage techniques, the distance-creating gesture of reflecting and the medialization of the Other Timm avoids any exoticism and aims to deconstruct German colonialism.

40|$|The {{issue of}} labour is {{presently}} a central theme in Kenyan history, but {{the emergence of}} wage employment {{is one of the}} most neglected although interesting stories about it remain to be told. Earlier works are mostly generalised, not focused on a specific <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour.</b> This necessitated the need to examine the migrant labour system in Kimilili, a largely unmapped area of recent Kenyan social and economic history. The study investigated the emergence of a wage labour force in response to the economic changes brought by British annexation and establishment of European farms. This paper, apart from tracing African squatter’s response to wage labour between 1940 and 1963, also examines the early forms of protest. It also analyses the colonial government’s reaction to squatter responses to wage employment, in Trans Nzoia in the neighbourhood of Kimilili. In particular, the reaction of the colonial government to Dini Ya Musambwa (DYM) and labour consciousness is highlighted. This is partly assessed in terms of accommodation; a situation when squatter labourers accepted European employment and solved labour issues amicably. The study was based on archival research, oral interviews as well as analysing the existing literature on socio-economic history in general and labour history in particular.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to contemporary debates around {{the changing nature}} of work through a critical engagement with postoperaista (workerist) thought. The categories and concepts of affective labour and immaterial production, particularly as developed in recent postworkerist research, have been important in progressing analyses of contemporary shifts in the arrangements of work and reproduction. The focus upon the affective, emotional and cognitive has contributed to an innovative reconsideration of the growth of service work, cognitive labour, and complex demarcations of production and reproduction. Ultimately, however, this thesis argues that postworkerism reaches a political impasse by grounding labour in an ontology of affect and reinscribing a substantialist account of value. The thesis identifies three key limitations to the existing postworkerist analyses of immaterial and affective labour: historical, intensive and extensive. Each of these limits {{is a result of the}} particular way in which postworkerist thought entwines a Spinozist ontology of affect with the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour.</b> The thesis develops a critique of the historical construction of affective labour to address the first limit. It addresses the second limit by looking at the mobilisation of affect as a technique of management, and thus as an intensive mechanism in the control of labour. And it encounters the final limit in a discussion of affective technologies and their role in the extensive measurement of work. Having addressed these limits, I show that an analysis of affect in terms of class composition makes it possible to engage the question of affective labour without recapitulating the ontological and political impasse of postworkerism.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} an immanent {{critique of}} the concept of attention economy from the perspectives of labour, time, and power. The attention economy is a notion forged by authors belonging to the field of political economy in order to explain the growing value of human attention in societies characterised by post-industrial modes of production. In a world in which information and knowledge become central to the valorisation process of capital, human attention becomes a scarce and hence increasingly valuable commodity. At the same time, the attention economy turns human attention into a form of labour and hence into a new mechanism of capitalist exploitation. Using a series of contemporary readings of Marx (Postone; Lazzarato; Negri and Hardt;Deleuze and Guattari), this thesis develops a critique which does not simply apply Marxist categories to the object of the attention economy, but which uses the attention economy as a concrete object of analysis for reflecting upon both the validity and the importance of Marx‟s critique of political economy for a critique of contemporary capitalism. In other words, this research suggests that, although the attention economy has indeed turned human attention into a new form of labour, it is only through a systematic reinterpretation of Marx‟s categories that this claim can be fully grasped. This reinterpretation comprises two general aspects. Firstly, this thesis argues that {{the way in which the}} attention economy produces and exploits value puts into crisis the traditional <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> based on an industrial mode of production and which relies solely on abstract labour time as its general equivalent. This calls for an analysis of the labour-value relation from the standpoint of the endogenous transformation of capitalism. Secondly, this thesis suggests that the attention economy operates as a concrete power mechanism which reterritorializes the unleashed productive powers in order to reproduce capital‟s command over human activity. This requires addressing the specific transformations of the diagram of power from disciplinary societies towhat Deleuze has defined as societies of control...|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{the most}} recent time-period, all {{modalities}} of migration have existed, side-by-side, in Croatia, hence confirming {{a high degree of}} mobility of its population, and also indicating a wide range of factors causing migration. The scale of Croatian migration, the spatial distribution of the various sending areas, the demographic structure of the migrant contingent, and especially the negative migration balance on the national level, {{as well as on the}} level of the country’s main regions, are all indications of a negative effect on socio-economic and especially demographic development. At the same time, some forms of migration that have previously dominated – e. g. economic migration to the countries of Western Europe, seasonal internal migration and circulation of labour, rural-urban migration – are by now becoming phenomena of second-rate importance. Nevertheless, in the present migration constellation, migration still has a negative effect on the demographic development of Croatia. The internal demographic polarisation within Croatia, characterised by propulsive areas on the one hand, and an ever broader depopulational pole on the other, is increasing in relevance, since the vitality of demographic events (natural growth and a positive migration balance) is tied to large cities, which brings about a further problem, i. e. an asimetrical spatial development caused by the growing oligocentric significance of regional centres. The author estimates that natural growth of Croatia’s population in the inter-census period from 1991 to 2001 amounted to 45, 000. If only that component would be taken into account, Croatia’s population should have fallen from 4, 784, 265 to 4, 739, 265. The population, however, fell to 4, 437, 460. Therefore, on the basis of such (in fact discrepant) criteria, 301, 805 more persons left Croatia, than arrived through immigration in the same time-period. Two basic categories that have contributed to this loss are residents of Croatia that, according to the recommendations of international istitutes, are not registered as residents of settlements in the country, since they have been absent for more than twelve months. These categories are refugees and the contingent of persons employed abroad (and supported family members, living abroad with them). Another more recent <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> migrants should be added, which could be, conditionally, labelled “the brain drain”. Although it is difficult to make comparisons, during the census of 1991 a total of 285, 216 persons from Croatia were found to be employed abroad (or residing abroad as supported family members). This accounted for 6. 0 % of the total population of Croatia. If viewed today, the percentage of persons abroad in regard to the population residing in the country has fallen to 5. 6 %. This ratio does not include the population of refugees, which will certainly, at least in part, return to Croatia. If this group would have been incorporated in the category of persons abroad, the ratio would significantlybe different (although, during the official census, census-takers registered such persons as labour migrants and not as refugees). According to the author’s estimate, which is not a precise calculation (due to problems pertaining to methodological categories), in 2001 11. 9 % of Croatia’s population was living abroad...|$|E

40|$|State {{control over}} the labour market usually results in the {{creation}} <b>of</b> different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour,</b> each having partial and unequal access to that market. In the Third World, typically, justification for control arises from an over-supply <b>of</b> unskilled rural <b>labour</b> and a small demand for such labour in the wage economy. To reduce massive urban unemployment, the state attempts to control the process of rural-urban migration by, inter alia, manipulating the labour market. ^ In South Africa, the civilised <b>labour</b> policy <b>of</b> the Pact government and the highly sophisticated system of black influx control introduced after the Second World War are two examples of such state control. In these cases, racial <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour,</b> having differential access to the labour market, were created.

Since 1962, when it was administratively coordinated for the first time, this policy has been applied in the Western Cape, a region comprising the 68 magisterial districts situated south-west of Port Elizabeth, Kimberley and the Orange River. In this region, black work-seekers' access to the labour market is severely curtailed. A series of regulations, particular to the Western Cape, are applied with the object of restricting the number of blacks resident in the region; denying blacks permanent rights of sojourn in the region; restricting the scope of employment for blacks in the region; and favouring coloured above black work-seekers throughout the region. In short, the policy aims to replace black by coloured labour and thereby aims to reduce to a minimum the number of blacks in the region.

40|$|L'automation relève des {{sciences}} de {{la nature}} et des sciences de l'homme à la fois. Dans cet article, l'auteur s'applique à montrer que l'automation, envisagée comme problème humain, ou par rapport à ses conséquences probables sur la société en général, et sur les travailleurs en particulier, soulève des opinions variées, parfois contradictoires. Il propose un cadre de discussion, qui permette de tenir compte du plus grand nombre d'opinions possibles et il situe l'automation dans la chaîne historique des innovations. Automation {{is a question}} of the day. But opinions on the subject are divided. Professor Weiner, on the one hand, {{had this to say about}} it: "Let us remember that the automatic machine [...] . is the precise economic equivalent of slave labor. Any labor that competes with slave lahor must accept the economic conditions of slave labor. It is perfectly clear that this will produce an unemployment situation, in comparison with which [...] . the depression of the ' 30 will seem a pleasant joke. This depression will ruin many industries — possibly even the industries that have taken advantage of the new potentialities". On the other hand, Mr. D. J. Davis regards automation as a normal achievement and even wonders how our industrial society could go on without it: "We at Ford do not share the apprehensions of some that the increased use of automation equipment may throw thousands of people out of work or otherwise dislocate our economy. Indeed, without automation in the steel, chemical, refining, food processing and cigarette industries — to mention only a few that are much more highly automated than we ever hoped to be — there simply would not be enough production for their products to fill our needs and certainly not at prices we could, afford to pay". Mr. Davis, clearly enough, argues from the viewpoint of a production economist or engineer and is concerned mostly with the increase in efficiency and productivity; while Professor Wiener emphasizes the impact of automation upon the labour market. Both may hold extremist views about it. An inquiry conducted by the McGraw-Hill Department of Economics into 1, 574 companies, 20 % of which had automated their equipment, shows that 26 % of the automated companies recorded a 21 % increase in employment, 23 % a 16 % decrease. In the aggregate, a proportion of 51 % of those companies have recorded no change in global employment. But the report further discloses that automation is apt to change the pattern of the labour market, for it increases the demand for skilled labour. In 40 % of the companies investigated, it required a skilled maintenance personnel; in 21 %, it created the need for an increase in the engineering staff. On the other hand, the demand for unskilled labour declined, giving a 10 % decrease in employment opportunities for that <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> in the last 25 years, while the chance for a higher percentage of lay-off is forecast for the next 15 years. Although automation is likely to modify the character of the demand for labour over a period it may not change the global volume of employment. Because, however, automation may create such conditions as would stimulate the rise of new industries, the volume of employment should even grow, and then, assuming that those new industries are automated, the impact upon the social structure would be the greater. One may with advantage view automation with reference to the problems raised in economic history by "innovation". A number of inquiries have been made into the impact of innovation upon employment. — particularly with respect to "technological unemployment". The Carroll Report (1886), the Weintraub Report (1940) are cases in point. It may be that innovations are necessary elements in the normal growth of a capitalist society; they are bound to happen, by all means. In terms of normal growth — the long-run view emphasized by traditional economics — the loss incurred as a consequence of innovations is held to be compensated by advantages accrued to society from the same or other innovations. But, as an English economist has put it, in the long run we are all dead. The writer may suggest, by the way, that also in the short run some of us may be "all dead", as a consequence, direct or indirect, of automation. The short-run view emphasizes social adjustment; and social adjustment is one aspect of the general weal. Care must be taken, therefore, that in discussing automation, the perspective be defined in relation to a number of levels of analysis...|$|E
40|$|South Africa is {{currently}} confronting an HIV|AIDS crisis. HIV prevalence {{in the population}} {{is currently}} estimated at about 13 per cent with that number projected to increase {{over the next five}} years or so. Given the massive scale of the problem and the concentration of effects on adults of prime working age, the pandemic is expected to sharply influence a host of economic and non-economic variables. While the pandemic will certainly influence the rate of economic growth, structural changes are also likely to be one of the primary economic hallmarks of the AIDS pandemic. This paper builds on the work of Arndt and Lewis (2000) who estimated the aggregate macroeconomic impacts of the HIV|AIDS pandemic in South Africa using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) approach. They found that, despite dramatically lower rates of growth of the unskilled labor pool relative to the 'no AIDS' trend, estimated unemployment rates for unskilled labor in their base 'AIDS' scenario increased absolutely over most of the upcoming decade and are essentially the same (slightly higher in fact) as the rates estimated for a fictional 'no AIDS' scenario. In this paper, we seek to further investigate the interactions between unemployment and AIDS using the basic modeling approach set forth in Arndt and Lewis. Before projecting the impacts of the pandemic on unemployment, recently compiled historical data on employment, unemployment, and remuneration are presented. The unemployment problem is, rather, an employment problem; and it is concentrated primarily in the unskilled and semi-skilled labour category. Job creation performance over the past three decades in this category has been dismal with total employment (formal sector and informal sector) of unskilled and semi-skilled labourers in 1999 at only 92 per cent of the level present in 1970. In a country with an extraordinarily complex historical legacy such as South Africa, it is impossible to attribute this disastrous job creation performance to any single factor. Nevertheless, large differences in remuneration trends across labor classes and standard economic theory point to these trends as major contributing factors. By 1999, real remuneration per unskilled and semi-skilled worker had grown to 250 per cent of the 1970 level while remuneration for other categories had remained essentially flat. Based on these data, the neoclassical conclusion that unskilled and semi-skilled labor has been systematically pricing itself out of the market seems practically unavoidable. Employment growth has, given slow economic growth rates, gone hand in hand with wage moderation as in the highly skilled and skilled segments. In contrast, employment compression has been associated with substantial real remuneration growth as in the unskilled and semi-skilled segment. With this historical background in mind, we turn to examining the interactions between the AIDS pandemic and unemployment using a CGE approach. In the model, the unskilled and semi-skilled wage is fixed relative to the producer price index. As a result, employment levels by activity are the equilibrating variables. We find that, even though the pandemic is projected to drive growth rates in the supply of unskilled and semi-skilled labour to around zero, our analysis indicates that the pandemic will also depress labour demand leaving the unemployment rate, in our base 'AIDS' scenario, essentially unchanged compared with a fictional 'no AIDS' scenario. The pandemic depresses labour demand through three effects. Declines in the rate of overall economic growth. Pronounced declines in sectors that supply investment commodities, particularly the Construction and Equipment sectors. These two sectors happen to use unskilled and semi-skilled labour intensively and together account for a significant share (16. 3 per cent) of total payments to this <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour.</b> Beyond this investment demand effect (brought on by reduced savings), AIDS induced morbidity effects on unskilled and semi-skilled workers tend to depress output relatively more in sectors that use unskilled and semi-skilled labour intensively with further negative implications for employment. Countering these three effects will be key to palliating the negative economic consequences of the pandemic and reducing unemployment rates. To reduce the unemployment problem, South Africa must have rapid overall economic growth ideally with sectors that use unskilled and semi-skilled labour intensively leading the way. Results indicate that a policy of real wage moderation (or even modest decline) presents a straightforward option for bolstering overall economic growth. A wage moderation policy also provides a particularly large stimulus for sectors that use unskilled and semi-skilled labour intensively with further positive implications for employment.

A detailed review <b>of</b> different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> statutes in later chapters reveals specific conflict of laws problems that could not be solved through any single rule, especially when in international air transport setting. The divergence between domestic labour statutes and Treaties of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation or Air Transport Agreements also create subtle circumstance. All these point to the conflict <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> laws in international air transport as a relatively unexplored sphere, and the desirability of international unification of certain principles.

50|$|Labor law (also {{known as}} {{employment}} law) {{is the body}} of laws, administrative rulings, and precedents which address the legal rights of, and restrictions on, working people and their organizations. As such, it mediates {{many aspects of the}} relationship between trade unions, employers and employees. In Canada, employment laws related to unionized workplaces are differentiated from those relating to particular individuals. In most countries however, no such distinction is made. However, there are two broad <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> law. First, collective labour law relates to the tripartite relationship between employee, employer and union. Second, individual labour law concerns employees' rights at work and through the contract for work. The labour movement has been instrumental in the enacting <b>of</b> laws protecting <b>labour</b> rights in the 19th and 20th centuries. Labour rights have been integral to the social and economic development since the industrial revolution.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to explore a seeming puzzle {{in the context of}} Bangladesh. There is a {{considerable}} body of evidence from the country pointing to the positive impact of paid work on women’s position within family and community. Yet, according to official statistics, not only has women’s labour force participation risen very slowly over the years, but also a sizeable majority of women in the labour force are in unpaid family labour. We draw on an original survey of over 5000 women from eight different districts in Bangladesh to explore some of the factors that lead to women’s selection into the labour force, and into different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> market activity, with a view to gaining {{a better understanding of the}} combination of cultural norms and economic considerations that explain these findings...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study of}} {{horizontal}} and vertical solidarity within a national labour movement, based on a nationwide survey of members of affiliated unions of the Congress of South African Trade Unions. On the one hand, the survey reveals relatively high levels of vertical and horizontal solidarity, despite the persistence of some cleavages on gender and racial lines. On the other hand, the maintenance and deepening of existing horizontal and vertical linkages in a rapidly changing socio-economic context, represents one of many challenges facing organized labour in an industrializing economy. COSATU’s strength is contingent not only on an effective organizational capacity, and a supportive network linking key actors and interest groupings, {{but also on the}} ability to meet the concerns of existing constituencies and those assigned to highly marginalized <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Active {{labour market}} policy has gained {{emphasis}} in several OECD countries to promote efficient labour markets, and to combat rising unemployment. Consequently {{the question has}} gained interest, how to make these policies more effective. During {{the last ten years}} several {{attempts have been made to}} review the advances in the field <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> market policy evaluation. The paper gives an overview of the field, considering what steps could be taken, and what priorities could be assigned in the development of a rather comprehensive national evaluation practice. It is argued that each <b>of</b> the different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> market policy evaluation [...] policy analysis, impact analysis, and implementation analysis [...] should be taken seriously. Priority should be given especially to the development of implementation analysis: setting up sound monitoring systems and performance indicators must be considered as very important steps. Implementation evaluation has a close relationship to impact evaluation because appropriate structures of monitoring and performance indicators are a necessary precondition for impact studies. ...|$|R

25|$|Since {{the start}} of the CSM, eight <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> CARICOM {{nationals}} have been eligible for free movement throughout the CSME without the need for work permits. They are: University Graduates, Media Workers, Artistes, Musicians, Sportspersons, Managers, Technical and Supervisory Staff attached to a company and Self-Employed Persons/Service Providers. In addition the spouses and immediate dependent family members of these nationals will also be exempt from work permit requirements. At the July 2006 CARICOM Summit, it was agreed to allow for free movement <b>of</b> two more <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> skilled persons; tertiary-trained Teachers and Nurses. It was also agreed that higglers, artisans, domestic workers and hospitality workers are {{to be added to the}} <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> allowed free movement at a later date, pending the agreement of an appropriate certification. This envisioned extension for the latter <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> workers such as artisans was achieved in October 2007 with the launch of the Caribbean Vocational Qualification (CVQ). In 2009 Antigua and Barbuda was granted a five-year exemption to the extension of free movement to domestic workers, and in 2015 it was seeking the continuation of this exemption for a further 5 years.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} resource-based theory can be {{considered}} as a special case <b>of</b> the <b>labour</b> theory <b>of</b> value. Marx's development <b>of</b> the <b>labour</b> theory <b>of</b> value is used as a basis for exploring resource-based theory. The stages in the Circuit of Capital provide the structure for this exploration. Five <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> power are defined and developed which assists us in the exploration of various competitive phenomena of interest to strategy scholars. The resource-based theory of the firm (RBT) (Peteraf, 1993; Wernerfelt, 1984) argues that resources that are valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable and imperfectly substitutable are an organisation's main source of sustainable competitive advantage (Barney, 1991). Whilst most of the contributions to this view have focused on the ease with which valuable resources can be imitated, less consideration has been paid to what makes particular resources valuable in the first instance. Most contributions start from an assumption of a resource’s value, and then proceed to consider issues of imitability (Miller and Shamsie, 1996). This paper suggests that, in order to address this questio...|$|R
30|$|Following {{the pattern}} of {{responses}} from other variables in the different scenarios, additional jobs (labour force) will be created in Scenarios 2 and 4, while {{a reduction in the}} labour force is observed in Scenario 3. The scope of both unskilled and skilled jobs is expected to increase in equal proportion in Scenarios 2 and 4 with an expected increase of 83 thousand and 957 thousand jobs, respectively. An equal share of unskilled and skilled job reduction is expected from Scenario 2, i.e. total 46 thousand. Like other variables, the job creation also shows a similar pattern in case of ‘with USA’ and ‘without USA’ in the TPP. In the case of the TPP without the USA, Scenarios 1 and 4 are estimated to contribute 64 thousand and 510 thousand additional jobs to the economy. Scenario 2 is likely to reduce 31 thousand jobs. Out of a total <b>of</b> 5 <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour,</b> official and managerial jobs are expected to increase the most.|$|R

We propose a method to adjust flow estimates for bias, based on fitting separate multinomial logistic models to the classification error probabilities and the true state transition probabilities using values of auxiliary variables. Our approach has the advantages {{that it does not}} require external information on misclassification rates, it permits the identification of factors that are related to misclassification and true transitions and it does not assume independence between classification errors at successive points in time. Constraining the prediction of the stocks to agree with the observed stocks protects against model misspecification. We apply the approach to data on women from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with three <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> force status. The model fitted is shown to have interpretable coefficient estimates and to provide a good fit. Simulation results indicate good performance of the model in predicting the true flows and robustness against departures from the model postulated...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} some of the main drivers of high unemployment rates in the European Union countries starting from two sources highlighted in the economic literature: the shortfall of the aggregate demand and the increasing labour market mismatches. Our analysis is based on a panel database and focuses on two objectives: to measure the long and short-term impact of GDP growth on unemployment over recent years for different <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> market participants (young, older and low educated workers) and to evaluate the relationship between mismatches related to skills (educational and occupational) and unemployment. One of the main conclusions is that unemployment rates of young and low educated workers are more responsive to economic growth variations both in the long and short run, while unemployment rates of older workers show a greater capacity of adjustment. In addition, occupational mismatches seem to have a significant long-term impact on the changes in unemployment <b>of</b> all <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> unemployed, whereas the short run effect is rather mixed, varying across countries. One explanation is the fact that during crisis, economy’s structure tends to change more rapidly than labour market and educational system can adapt...|$|R
