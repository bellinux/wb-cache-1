5|$|An Octopus card may be {{returned}} to any MTR Customer Service Centre for a refund of the remaining credit stored on it.

5|$|On 6 November 2005, Octopus Cards Limited {{launched}} Octopus Rewards, {{a program}} that allows cardholders to earn rewards at merchants that are partners in the program. Participating merchants provide consumers with tailor-made offers and privileges. The rewards that the program offers are {{in the form of}} points, or reward dollars, stored on the card. Once a card is registered for the program, the <b>cardholder</b> may accumulate reward points by making purchases at participating merchants, and payments may be made in the form of cash, credit cards, or Octopus cards themselves. The rate at which reward points are earned per dollar-amount purchase differs by the merchant at which that the purchases are made. At Wellcome, for example, one point is earned for every purchase of HK$200; and at Watsons, points are earned at a rate of 0.5 percent per dollar amount of a purchase. Once these reward dollars are accumulated, they may be redeemed as payment for purchases at partner merchants for at least HK$1 per reward dollar. To redeem the accumulated reward dollars, cardholders must use the entire value amount in whole, and may not elect to use it partially. If the purchase price is lower than the amount of reward dollars available, the amount difference remains stored on the card. Founding partners for the Octopus Rewards program include HSBC, UA Cinemas and Wellcome.|$|E

25|$|Most {{of these}} {{conditions}} are usually described in a <b>cardholder</b> agreement which the <b>cardholder</b> signs when their account is opened.|$|E
25|$|Each month, the <b>cardholder</b> is sent a {{statement}} indicating the purchases {{made with the}} card, any outstanding fees, and the total amount owed. In the US, after receiving the statement, the <b>cardholder</b> may dispute any charges {{that he or she}} thinks are incorrect (see , which limits <b>cardholder</b> liability for unauthorized use of a credit card to $50). The Fair Credit Billing Act gives details of the US regulations. The <b>cardholder</b> must pay a defined minimum portion of the amount owed by a due date, or may choose to pay a higher amount. The credit issuer charges interest on the unpaid balance if the billed amount is not paid in full (typically at a much higher rate than most other forms of debt). In addition, if the <b>cardholder</b> fails to make at least the minimum payment by the due date, the issuer may impose a late fee or other penalties. To help mitigate this, some financial institutions can arrange for automatic payments to be deducted from the cardholder's bank account, thus avoiding such penalties altogether, as long as the <b>cardholder</b> has sufficient funds.|$|E
25|$|The main {{benefit to}} the <b>cardholder</b> is convenience. Compared to debit cards and checks, a credit card allows small {{short-term}} loans to be quickly made to a <b>cardholder</b> who need not calculate a balance remaining before every transaction, provided the total charges do not exceed the maximum credit line for the card.|$|E

25|$|Many banks {{now also}} offer {{the option of}} {{electronic}} statements, either in lieu of or in addition to physical statements, which can be viewed at any time by the <b>cardholder</b> via the issuer's online banking website. Notification {{of the availability of}} a new statement is generally sent to the cardholder's email address. If the card issuer has chosen to allow it, the <b>cardholder</b> may have other options for payment besides a physical check, such as an electronic transfer of funds from a checking account. Depending on the issuer, the <b>cardholder</b> may also be able to make multiple payments during a single statement period, possibly enabling him or her to utilize the credit limit on the card several times.|$|E

25|$|A {{secured credit}} card {{is a type}} of credit card secured by a deposit account owned by the <b>cardholder.</b> Typically, the <b>cardholder</b> must deposit between 100% and 200% of the total amount of credit desired. Thus if the <b>cardholder</b> puts down $1,000, they will be given credit in the range of $500–1,000. In some cases, credit card issuers will offer {{incentives}} even on their secured card portfolios. In these cases, the deposit required may be significantly less than the required credit limit, and can be as low as 10% of the desired credit limit. This deposit is held in a special savings account. Credit card issuers offer this because they have noticed that delinquencies were notably reduced when the customer perceives something to lose if the balance is not repaid.|$|E
40|$|Overdrafts {{have been}} an ongoing concern of policymakers. They {{are one of the}} main issues in the prepaid card rules that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is {{currently}} proposing. Despite regulatory interventions and heated debate between proponents and opponents of further intervention, little research has been conducted to understand the overdraft behavior of prepaid <b>cardholders.</b> This paper attempts to fill that gap by analyzing a large micro-level dataset of general purpose reloadable (GPR) prepaid <b>cardholders.</b> We find that a small percentage of GPR prepaid <b>cardholders</b> regularly make overdraft transactions and incur overdraft fees, but they tend to spend and load more funds on their card as well as use their card {{for a longer period of}} time than do <b>cardholders</b> who do not make overdraft transactions. Our results suggest that some <b>cardholders</b> may be making a deliberate decision to overdraw their account and pay overdraft fees...|$|R

50|$|The DCC {{provider}} {{guarantees that}} the amount in the <b>cardholder's</b> currency will be debited to the <b>cardholder's</b> account, and that the merchant's account will be credited with the amount in the local currency. The exchange rate risk is borne by the DCC provider. The <b>cardholder's</b> credit card issuer may choose to impose an additional foreign transaction fee on the transaction, which appears on the statement, but typically they will not charge this fee when not providing a service.|$|R
25|$|The {{credit card}} issuer issues {{a credit card}} to a {{customer}} at the time or after an account has {{been approved by the}} credit provider, which need not be the same entity as the card issuer. The cardholders can then use it to make purchases at merchants accepting that card. When a purchase is made, the <b>cardholder</b> agrees to pay the card issuer. The <b>cardholder</b> indicates consent to pay by signing a receipt with a record of the card details and indicating the amount to be paid or by entering a personal identification number (PIN). Also, many merchants now accept verbal authorizations via telephone and electronic authorization using the Internet, known as a card not present transaction (CNP).|$|E
25|$|After {{purchasing}} the card, the <b>cardholder</b> loads the account with {{any amount of}} money, up to the predetermined card limit and then uses the card to make purchases {{the same way as}} a typical credit card. Prepaid cards can be issued to minors (above 13) since there is no credit line involved. The main advantage over secured credit cards (see above section) is that the <b>cardholder</b> is not required to come up with $500 or more to open an account. With prepaid credit cards purchasers are not charged any interest but are often charged a purchasing fee plus monthly fees after an arbitrary time period. Many other fees also usually apply to a prepaid card.|$|E
25|$|The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is the {{security}} standard {{issued by the}} Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC).

50|$|One {{significant}} disadvantage is that <b>cardholders</b> {{are likely}} to see their browser connect to unfamiliar domain names {{as a result of}} vendors' MPI implementations and the use of outsourced ACS implementations by issuing banks, which might make it easier to perform phishing attacks on <b>cardholders.</b>|$|R

25|$|A credit card's {{grace period}} {{is the time}} the <b>cardholder</b> has to pay the balance before {{interest}} is assessed on the outstanding balance.
