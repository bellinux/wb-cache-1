5|$|A {{number of}} fixed {{structures}} can create structural colours, by mechanisms including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres and deformed matrices. Structures can {{be far more}} elaborate than a single thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out the inevitable <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect. Each mechanism offers a specific {{solution to the problem}} of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.|$|E
25|$|The visuo-spatial sketchpad {{is part of}} Baddeley and Hitch’s {{model of}} working memory. It is {{responsible}} for temporarily storing visual and spatial information, which is currently being used or encoded. It is {{thought of as a}} three-dimensional cognitive map, which contains spatial features about where the person is and visual images of the area, or an object being concentrated on. It is used in tasks such as mental image manipulation where a person imagines how a real object would look if it were changed in some way (rotated, flipped, moved, <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour,</b> etc.). It is also responsible for representing how vivid an image is. A vivid image is one which you have a high potential for retrieving its sensory details. The visuo-spatial sketchpad is responsible for holding onto the visual and spatial qualities of a vivid image in your working memory, and the degree of vividness is directly affected by the limits of the sketchpad.|$|E

Following customer feedback and comments about the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour,</b> the colour scheme {{was returned to}} the original white and buff, but with the addition of the fluttering house flag, complete with the red lettering. For much of the first decade of the 21st century, Scillonian III remained in this appearance.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{includes}} the [...] "fish eyes" [...] which occur throughout the marls {{in the red}} mudstones. These are small spherical regions in which the iron oxide colouration has been discharged about a centre. A minute speck is usually found in the middle. The colour {{has been attributed to}} the decay of small specks of organic matter but recent work suggests that a radioactive centre may be responsible. Other examples of this secondary <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> from red to greenish-grey are seen along joint planes where the altered zone may only be a fraction of a millimetre thick and sometimes on the cheeks of a gypsum vein.|$|E
2500|$|In {{announcing the}} change, Tiley said Plexicushion {{would have a}} [...] "lower rubber content than Rebound Ace, was firmer under foot and {{retained}} less heat through its thinner top layer." [...] Tiley later said that the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour,</b> from green to blue, would also benefit players and officials, although this change was quite arbitrary. The manufacturers of Rebound Ace derided the new surface, with director Paul Bull saying that, [...] "We had an Australian icon event with a unique Australian product {{and now we are}} just going to become a clone of the U.S. Open." [...] Bull also said that the inconsistencies in pace were down to the organizers' imperative, who kept asking for the pace to be adjusted to pander for certain players, such as Hewitt. Bull, however, conceded that a change was needed; and said that the suggestion of a Rebound Ace court with a rubber mat thickness of around 5mm was made.|$|E

2500|$|The Plexicushion surface {{received}} a relatively mixed reception from players. Lleyton Hewitt, Justine Henin and Serena Williams were all keen {{to endorse the}} new courts; with Hewitt's appraisal focused on the greater consistency of the courts. Henin called it a [...] "good surface" [...] but {{said she did not}} find it markedly distinguishable from Rebound Ace, saying the biggest difference was the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour.</b> Williams claimed that the court was not as [...] "bouncy" [...] and was causing less physical strain on her feet and ankles. One source of criticism from players was the slower than expected pace, although many of these comments came prior to the event's commencement. Players were exposed to the new courts through other tournaments, played in advance of the Open; and practise on the new surface. Roger Federer described it as slow, with Novak Djokovic, Jelena Janković and James Blake all corroborating this opinion, albeit from experience in preliminary tournaments. Pundit and former World No. 1 Pat Rafter said it was possible that the courts would speed up in time.|$|E
