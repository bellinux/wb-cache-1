5|$|This {{letter was}} one of several that Travis sent during the siege of the Alamo. Each carried a similar message—the Mexican army had invaded Texas, the Alamo was surrounded, and the Texians needed more men and {{ammunition}} to wage a successful defense. No assistance was forthcoming from the Texas government. By this point infighting had rendered the provisional government <b>completely</b> <b>ineffective,</b> and delegates convened on March 1 at the Convention of 1836 to create a new government. Most of the delegates believed that Travis exaggerated the difficulties he faced.|$|E
5|$|In 10–20% of endometrial cancers, mostly Grade3 (the highest histologic grade), {{mutations}} {{are found}} in a tumor suppressor gene, commonly p53 or PTEN. In 20% of endometrial hyperplasias and 50% of endometrioid cancers, PTEN suffers a loss-of-function mutation or a null mutation, making it less effective or <b>completely</b> <b>ineffective.</b> Loss of PTEN function leads to up-regulation of the PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway, which causes cell growth. The p53 pathway can either be suppressed or highly activated in endometrial cancer. When a mutant version of p53 is overexpressed, the cancer tends to be particularly aggressive. P53 mutations and chromosome instability are associated with serous carcinomas, which tend to resemble ovarian and Fallopian carcinomas. Serous carcinomas are thought to develop from endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma.|$|E

According to PVA Deputy Commander Han Xianchu's evaluation of PVA, [...] "many regiments and battalions are <b>completely</b> combat <b>ineffective,</b> with some divisions only half strength". On February 7, 1951, Mao decided that PLA 3rd, 19th, 20th Army and 47th Corps—from Sichuan, Gansu, Hebei and Hunan provinces respectively—would enter Korea to replace the PVA 13th Army currently on the front. But despite the massive mobilization effort, only the 26th Corps from the recovering PVA 9th Army actually arrived at the front during March 1951.|$|R

40|$|Increased relaxin (RLN) peptide {{expression}} {{has been}} found in prostrate, breast, and endometrial cancers. The proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects of relaxin contribute to cancer growth, and thus a small-molecule antagonist of relaxin signaling may inhibit these cancer-promoting effects. We have identified several antagonists, which suppress activation of the G protein-coupled relaxin receptor, relaxin/insulin like family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP 1), and are <b>completely</b> or partially <b>ineffective</b> against the closely related receptor RXFP 2. The goal {{of this study is to}} define the region of relaxin receptor responsible for antagonist response. Comparison of amino acid sequences between RXFP 1 and RXFP 2 revealed 14 differences in this region of the proteins from which we created point mutants to analyze the differential response of the two receptors. The activation of the receptors transiently transfected in HEK 293 T cells was quantified by measuring cyclic AMP (cAMP) production, which is induced when RXFP 1 is stimulated by RLN or when RXFP 2 is activated by its cognate ligand, INSL 3. It was determined that a singular amino acid change in RXFP 1 is not sufficient to affect antagonistic response. Then, we tested the efficacy of the antagonists against a series of mutant receptors containing different portions of RXFP 1 and RXFP 2. The cDNA fragments of the two receptors were produced using high-fidelity PCR and combined by an infusion protocol. All chimeric receptors were tested for their cAMP response to RLN and INSL 3. First, two chimeric receptors were analyzed: RXFP 1 / 2 and RXFP 2 / 1, containing the ectodomain of one receptor and seven transmembrane domain (7 TM) of the second. An additional 5 chimeras were created with the C-terminal parts of the RXFP 1 or RXFP 2 7 TM. The substitution of the 7 TM in RXFP 2 with the RXFP 1 domain rendered the chimeric receptor more responsive to antagonists. Furthermore, another two chimeras were created to assess the significance of the individual C-terminal parts for RXFP 1 and RXFP 2 on overall antagonism. Our data provides insight on the nature of small molecule binding to the receptor, which will facilitate further modifications of the antagonists to increase their activity and efficacy as a potential agent to suppress tumorigenesis...|$|R

Lin ordered his forces to besiege Siping, but they suffered very high casualties and made little progress, partially due to the defenders' strong entrenched position and air support, and due to the attackers' poor artillery support (Lin only had seventy pieces of artillery around Siping). Lin's forces broke into the city twice and engaged in street-to-street fighting, but were driven back both times with heavy casualties.
