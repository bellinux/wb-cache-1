Three were rebuilt for use on the Montrealer, an overnight train between Washington, D.C. and Montreal. Booths and lounge seating replaced the coach seating and club seats. These were later rebuilt as all-table dinettes. Most clubs were rebuilt as club-dinette <b>cars,</b> <b>with</b> one half given over to booths and the other having 2×1 seating.

Red Bull equipped both of their <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> new turning vanes for the Grand Prix {{in order to improve}} the airflow underneath the car and therefore create more downforce. The new device had previously only been used by Daniil Kvyat during the previous race in Singapore. After a poor performance in Singapore, Mercedes introduced a revised rear wing endplate, while McLaren brought a new front wing to Suzuka.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{popularity}} of the film's <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> customizers and hot rodders in the years since its release, their fate immediately after the film is ironic.

The yellow Deuce and the white T-bird went unsold, despite being priced as low as US$3,000. The registration plate on Milner's yellow deuce coupe is THX138 on a yellow, California license plate, slightly altered, reflecting Lucas's earlier science fiction film.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Amtrak found {{itself with a}} supply of surplus Metroliner <b>cars</b> <b>with</b> {{problematic}} propulsion systems, but with sound body and frame, stored at their Wilmington and Bear shop complexes in Delaware. The coaches were, except for the propulsion systems, a near-identical match to Amfleet coaches. Twenty-nine of the 31 coaches were renumbered and used as cab control cars for corridor services. This allowed trains to operate in push-pull service, rather than needing to be turned around on a wye at terminals or to have a locomotive on each end.|$|E
