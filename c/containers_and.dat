5|$|Gulf {{promoted}} {{the concept of}} branded product sales by selling gasoline in <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> from pumps marked with a distinctive orange disc logo. A customer buying Gulf-branded gasoline could be assured of its quality and consistent standard. (In the early 20th century, non-branded gasoline in the United States was often contaminated or of unreliable quality).|$|E
5|$|Since 2002, the American National Archives stores {{important}} national documents {{such as the}} Declaration of Independence and the Constitution within argon-filled {{cases to}} inhibit their degradation. Argon is preferable to the helium {{that had been used}} in the preceding five decades, because helium gas escapes through the intermolecular pores in most <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> must be regularly replaced.|$|E
5|$|Storm Coaster is themed {{around the}} effects of a Category 5 Tropical Cyclone at a coastal {{shipping}} port. Theming surrounding the ride depicts a path of destruction from the storm, with boats, cars, shipping <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> other debris strewn throughout. However, the port {{is in the eye of}} the storm and everyone must evacuate via Coast Guard rescue boats.|$|E
50|$|For {{military}} transport planes special <b>container</b> <b>and</b> pallet loaders are used.

5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} airtight <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E
5|$|Cookie {{cutting and}} decorating reached its {{cultural}} zenith during the boomer years with Christmas cookie cutouts of reindeer, trees, stars, and bells providing sustenance {{for kids and}} dads. Moms packed their favorite home baked cookies into Tupperware <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> carried them to cookie swap parties with friends and neighbors. Red plastic cutters replaced tin cutters {{during the war years}} when metal was scarce and can be found today at garage sales and flea markets.|$|E
5|$|Drywood {{termites}} {{thrive in}} warm climates, and human activities can {{enable them to}} invade homes since they can be transported through contaminated goods, <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> ships. Colonies of termites have been seen thriving in warm buildings located in cold regions. Some termites are considered invasive species. Cryptotermes brevis, the most widely introduced invasive termite species in the world, has been introduced to all the islands in the West Indies and to Australia.|$|E

5|$|Hand grenade, {{explosive}}: Before explosive grenades, incendiary grenades {{were used}} by the Eastern Roman Empire, incorporating Greek fire. Early prototypes to the modern explosive grenade, according to British scientist and sinologist Joseph Needham, appear in the military book, Wujing Zongyao ("Compilation of Military Classics"), by 1044. During the Song Dynasty, weapons known as Zhen Tian Lei were created when Chinese soldiers packed gunpowder into ceramic or metal <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> thrown at the enemy. Further descriptions and illustrations of early Chinese hand grenades are provided in the Huolongjing.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, the New Zealand Red Cross provided $10,000 (2004NZD) for essential relief supplies. In addition, the New Zealand government provided $70,000 {{for assistance in}} the most affected areas, after the country's Air Force dispatched a plane over Vanuatu {{to determine the extent}} of damage. The Government of Australia similarly sent a helicopter reconnaissance mission to determine damage, as well as two planes with $200,000 (2004AUD) in relief supplies, including 2,400tarps, 2,600water <b>containers,</b> <b>and</b> 5,200packets of water purification tablets. The French government also sent a helicopter and assistance as per the 1992 FRANZ Agreement between New Zealand, Australia, and France.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,000schools {{and churches}} were {{converted}} to emergency shelters, but residents only occupied 47 of them before the storm's arrival. The country's high crime rate led islanders to fear for their belongings should they abandon their homes. UNICEF prepared 4emergency health kits and 1,000water <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program prepared food stock in nearby Haiti, ready to move them to Jamaica if they were needed, although damage to their airport ultimately prevented their distribution.|$|E

5|$|The {{exoskeleton}} of {{the abdomen}} {{is divided into}} plates called dorsal tergites and ventral sternites. Wax is secreted from glands on the abdomen and extruded between the sternites where it resembles flakes of dandruff. It is secreted by the queen when she starts a nest and by young workers. It is scraped from the abdomen by the legs, moulded until malleable and used {{in the construction of}} honeypots, to cover the eggs, to line empty cocoons for use as storage <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> sometimes to cover the exterior of the nest.|$|E
5|$|The years 904â€“906 saw {{the use of}} {{incendiary}} projectiles called 'flying fires' (fei-huo). Needham (1986) {{argues that}} gunpowder was first used in warfare in China in 919 as a fuse for the ignition of another incendiary, Greek fire. Initially, gunpowder mixtures were utilised through traditional engines and throwing mechanisms; <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> grenades were thrown by mangonels and trebuchets, and explosive rockets and arrows were developed, along with gunpowder flamethrowers.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of Exmoor's human occupation from Mesolithic times onwards. In the Neolithic period people started to manage animals and grow crops on farms cleared from the woodland, rather than act purely as hunter gatherers. It is also likely that extraction and smelting of mineral ores to make tools, weapons, <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> ornaments in bronze and then iron started in the late Neolithic and into the Bronze and Iron Ages.|$|E

5|$|While the Trans-Siberian {{has always}} {{been used by the}} Czarist, Soviet and modern Russian {{government}} to project political power into their territories in Asia, in the 1960s it was opened by the USSR as an international trade route connecting the Western Pacific with Europe. Freight shipments on the Trans-Siberian, however, experienced increasing problems over time with dilapidated rail infrastructures, theft, damaged freight, late trains, inflated freight fees, uncertain scheduling for return of <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> geopolitical tension. As a result, use of the railway for international trade declined to almost zero by the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of Hurricane Beta, the U.S. {{ambassador}} to Nicaragua signed a disaster declaration on October28, prompting the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to send aid. Before the storm hit, $200,000 {{was sent to}} the country for emergency relief supply distribution and helicopter fuel. On November1, USAID and OFDA airlifted 200 rolls of plastic sheeting, 5,020 ten-litre water <b>containers,</b> <b>and</b> 2,736 hygiene kits, valued at $120,877. Another $22,000 was used to supply an aircraft and Bell 204/205 helicopter to assist affected areas. On November10, another $100,000 was sent for sanitation and health activities. The United Nations sent $10,000 to the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region to cover emergency needs. Forty-five tents were sent to communities in need. The Spanish Government also sent $377,188 in aid and to Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|As an adult, {{the house}} sparrow mostly feeds on {{the seeds of}} grains and weeds, but it is {{opportunistic}} and adaptable, and eats whatever foods are available. In towns and cities, it often scavenges for food in garbage <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> congregates in the outdoors of restaurants and other eating establishments to feed on leftover food and crumbs. It can perform complex tasks to obtain food, such as opening automatic doors to enter supermarkets, clinging to hotel walls to watch vacationers on their balconies, and nectar robbing kowhai flowers. In common with many other birds, the house sparrow requires grit to digest the harder items in its diet. Grit can be either stone, often grains of masonry, or the shells of eggs or snails; oblong and rough grains are preferred.|$|E
50|$|In {{cases where}} the blades are removable, the {{container}} should have an o-ring or gasket between {{the body of the}} <b>container</b> <b>and</b> the base to seal the <b>container</b> <b>and</b> prevent the contents from leaking. The blending container is generally shaped in a way that encourages material to circulate through the blades, rather than simply spinning around.|$|R

5|$|Exposure to {{radiation}} {{sources such as}} high-energy, ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to {{the immune system and}} changes to the white blood cell count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of cancer, plus damage to the eyes, nervous system, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. On a round-trip Mars mission lasting three years, nearly the entire body would be traversed by high energy nuclei, each of which can cause ionization damage to cells. Fortunately, most such particles are significantly attenuated by the shielding provided by the aluminium walls of a spacecraft, and can be further diminished by water <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research will be needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.|$|E
5|$|In this installment, Link gains {{experience}} {{points to}} upgrade his attack, magic, and life by defeating enemies. This feature is exclusive to Zelda II {{in the game}} series. He can raise each of these attributes {{to a maximum of}} eight levels. Raising a life level will decrease the damage Link receives when hit, raising a magic level will decrease the magic points (MP) cost of spells, and raising an attack level will strengthen his sword's offensive power. Each attribute requires a different amount of experience to level up, with the life level requiring the least number of points to level and attack requiring the most. When enough points are acquired to raise an attribute, the player may choose to level up that attribute or to cancel and continue gaining experience points towards the next level in another attribute. Once Link has raised an attribute to the maximum level of eight, further advances in that attribute will earn Link an extra life, without advancing the attribute itself. Link begins the game with four Heart <b>Containers</b> <b>and</b> four Magic <b>Containers</b> <b>and</b> can acquire up to four more of each, permanently increasing his life points and magic points respectively. Other games in The Legend of Zelda series only allow Link to increase his strength through new weapons, items, and Heart Containers. Certain enemies drain Link's experience when they attack, but he will never lose a level once raised. When a game ends or is saved, the cartridge records Link's current ability levels and the number of experience points required for the next increase, but resets his accumulated points to zero.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey is a {{role-playing}} game {{in which}} players control the main protagonist, who can be named by the player. The environments within the Schwarzwelt are seen and navigated from a first-person perspective: the 3D environment is displayed on the top screen of the Nintendo DS, while a 2D map is displayed on the bottom screen. Explored environments are automatically mapped out, with highlights being placed for unopened <b>containers</b> <b>and</b> doorways. These environments contain traps including pits, shifting floors, and floor tiles which damage the protagonist if stepped on. Alongside the main story quests, human non-playable characters and demons within the Schwarzwelt unlock side quests which yielded rewards upon completion. During the game, the protagonist's Demonica suit can be upgraded to open new pathways, enabling entry into new areas for story progression, {{as well as new}} parts of previously explored areas.|$|E
