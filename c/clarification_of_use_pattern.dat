40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a method for}} predicting resource availability in opportunistic grids by means <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>pattern</b> analysis (UPA), a technique based on non-supervised learning methods. This prediction method {{is based on the}} assumption of the existence of several classes <b>of</b> computational resource <b>use</b> <b>patterns,</b> which can be used to predict the resource availability. Trace-driven simulations validate this basic assumptions, which also provide the parameter settings for the accurate learning <b>of</b> resource <b>use</b> <b>patterns.</b> Experiments made with an implementation of the UPA method show the feasibility <b>of</b> its <b>use</b> in the scheduling of grid tasks with very little overhead. The experiments also demonstrate the method`s superiority over other predictive and non-predictive methods. An adaptative prediction method is suggested to deal with the lack of training data at initialization. Further adaptative behaviour is motivated by experiments which show that, in some special environments, reliable resource <b>use</b> <b>patterns</b> may not always be detected.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{contribution}} that pattern languages could make to user participation {{in the design of}} interactive systems, and we report on our experiences <b>of</b> <b>using</b> <b>pattern</b> languages in this way. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>patterns</b> and pattern languages in the design of interactive systems. Pattern languages were originally developed by the architect, Christopher Alexander, both as a way of understanding the nature of building designs that promote a ‘humane’ or living built environment; and as a practical tool to aid in participatory design of buildings. Our experience suggests that pattern languages do have considerable potential to support participatory design in HCI, but that many pragmatic issues remain to be resolved. </p...|$|R
