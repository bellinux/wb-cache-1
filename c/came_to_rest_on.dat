5|$|August 27–28, 1878 – Streets are {{clogged with}} fallen trees as a {{hurricane}} passes to the north. At {{the height of}} a storm, a floating dry dock—the largest ever built at the time—is damaged after breaking from its moorings at HM Dockyard, crushing wharves and a mooring bridge. The dock <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> a breakwater.|$|E
5|$|As {{an active}} civil airfield, {{operations}} at Duxford are {{regulated by the}} Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). In 2002 a privately operated Aero L-39 Albatros suffered a braking failure on landing, overran the runway and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> the M11 motorway, a student pilot being killed after ejecting at ground level. An Air Accidents Investigation Branch inquiry recommended a review of arrangements for aircraft taking off or landing towards the M11. As a result, the CAA and Duxford agreed {{to a reduction in}} the runway's 1500m declared length, from 1350m to 1200m, in order to provide a greater margin of error.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{all of the}} aircraft's {{wreckage}} still lies {{where it}} <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> the slopes of Mount Erebus, under a layer of snow and ice. During warm periods, when snow recedes, it is visible from the air.|$|E

25|$|On 27 November 1984, a Beechcraft Baron 58, {{registration}} VH-ETV, {{operating a}} charter {{flight to the}} airport, suffered a left landing gear failure and was substantially damaged. The aircraft departed the runway surface and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> the grass. None of the occupants were seriously injured.|$|E
25|$|On June 13, 1997, a North American Airlines Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner {{struck the}} runway with gear {{retracted}} during a botched approach, resulting in propellor strikes and {{a fire in}} one engine when it <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> runway 25. The aircraft was written off, but the crew escaped without injury.|$|E
25|$|On September 19, 1996, A {{privately owned}} Grumman F9F-2 Panther crashed while takeoff on runway 35. Pilot {{attempted}} a takeoff abort but over ran {{the end of}} the runway crashed through a boundary fence, crossed over Kilgore Road, and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> an embankment. Pilot suffered numerous injuries and aircraft was a total loss.|$|E
50|$|In some {{versions}} of the Greek flood myth, the ark of Deucalion <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> the slopes of Parnassus. This is the version of the myth recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses.|$|R
5000|$|Due {{partly to}} its short length, [...] "The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner" [...] poem {{has been widely}} anthologized. In fact, Jarrell <b>came</b> <b>to</b> fear that his {{reputation}} would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> it alone.|$|R
50|$|Rocks, each 30 cm {{or so in}} diameter, are {{suspended}} from ropes of different lengths. As the net is raised, some of the rocks one-by-one <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> a platform thereby keeping everything in balance.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} just cleared high-tension {{overhead power}} lines and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> a narrow strip of land surrounded by tall trees immediately south of the A30 road, and a short distance south of the King George VI Reservoir {{near the town of}} Staines-upon-Thames. There was no fire on impact, but one broke out during the rescue effort when cutting apparatus was used.|$|E
25|$|On 26 June 2016, {{the roller}} coaster Tsunami derailed, falling into the crowd below, {{injuring}} seven children and two adults. On the way down it hit the main structure and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> a toddlers' ride. Ten park guests were taken to local hospitals for treatment. The park was evacuated following the incident. The ride was dismantled and removed eight months later.|$|E
25|$|On 31 August 2012, ATR 42-500 {{registration}} AP-BHJ, operating Flight 653 from Islamabad to Lahore, was {{landing at}} Allama Iqbal International Airport when it undershot the runway and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> a grassy {{area on the}} right side of Runway 36R. There were no fatalities among the 42 passengers and 4 crew members. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and withdrawn from service.|$|E

50|$|The Swift (นกนางแอ่น): At dusk, the swifts {{fly around}} the city centre and <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> houses, {{buildings}} and electricity lines—especially on the Bell Tower that is well lit at night. The birds have become one of Betong's symbols.|$|R
5000|$|Off {{the coast}} of South America, the atomic powered cruise liner Prince Charles is hijacked by revolutionaries. Flood tides carry it deep into the Amazon basin where it {{eventually}} <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> land, like Noah's Ark, with hundreds of passengers.|$|R
25|$|On January 12, 1992, Graham Sellers, {{the pilot}} and only {{occupant}} of a Piper Twin Comanche two-engine four-seater plane, died when both engines failed on his final approach to land at the airport. Sellars was test flying the aircraft after it had been serviced for engine problems. His plane clipped the treetops, crashed through the airport's perimeter chain link fence and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> the grass next to Runway 33.|$|E
25|$|Corden-Lloyd {{was killed}} {{and the other two}} {{passengers}} were wounded. The machine <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> its right side. The pilot remained trapped inside the wreckage, but he survived thanks to his helmet. The IRA claimed they had shot at the helicopter with an M60 machine gun. The IRA unit vanished into the Dromad woods to the Republic of Ireland. Some Gardaí witnessed the attack {{from the other side of}} the border.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Normandie {{was seized}} by U.S. {{authorities}} at New York and renamed USS Lafayette. In 1942, the liner caught fire while being converted to a troopship, capsized onto her port side and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> the mud of the Hudson River at Pier 88, {{the site of the}} current New York Passenger Ship Terminal. Although salvaged at great expense, restoration was deemed too costly and she was scrapped in October 1946.|$|E
5000|$|March 19, 2008: Cirrus flight 1569 from Berlin-Tempelhof {{overshoots}} runway 27 and <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> a well {{close to}} a highway. Nobody of the 27 on board is hurt, but the aircraft, a Dornier Do 328 (D-CTOB), is severely damaged.|$|R
50|$|The name Tektite {{generally}} {{refers to}} a class of meteorites formed by extremely rapid cooling. These include objects of celestial origins that strike the sea surface and <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> the bottom (note project Tektite's conceptual origins within the U.S space program).|$|R
50|$|Finally, in {{the fourth}} movement, Prokofiev reprises musical {{materials}} from earlier in the symphony, beginning at a comfortable andante pace and gradually accelerating.

25|$|On 9 November 2012, BFL509, a Curtiss C-46A (C-GTXW), {{landed at}} Yellowknife Airport {{and when it}} rolled to the runway 16/34 intersection, the left main landing gear collapsed. The {{aircraft}} then <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> the left wing and suffered substantial damage. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service. The cause of the accident was that a hammer, lodged between the inboard drag strut and sliding member, caused the landing gear to collapse.|$|E
25|$|During {{the impact}} and short ground roll, the nose gear collapsed, the right main gear {{separated}} from the aircraft, penetrating the central fuel tank and cabin space, and the left main gear was pushed up through the wing. The aircraft <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> the threshold markings {{at the start of}} the runway. A significant amount of fuel leaked, but there was no fire. Four crew members and eight passengers received minor injuries, and one passenger received serious injuries (concussion and a broken leg).|$|E
25|$|The train's {{speed at}} the time of {{derailment}} was an estimated 65–70km/h. The F 1200 locomotive was the first to derail, sliding down the embankment until it <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> its right side on the road below. The cars between the locomotive and the dining car were completely destroyed while the dining car partially slid down the embankment towards the road, ending up at a 45° angle on the slope between the embankment and the road. The last two cars remained standing on the tracks.|$|E
5000|$|The hidden feature (backstage {{on their}} European tour) can be {{accessed}} by waiting {{a couple of minutes}} on the title screen. A car will be heard to crash, a wheel will then roll across and <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> the screen, allowing a pop-up option of [...] "Backstage".|$|R
5000|$|If {{the ball}} does not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> {{the spot where}} it was placed, it must be {{replaced}} without penalty. If it will not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest,</b> it must be placed at the nearest point where it will <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest,</b> and either not in a hazard if not originally in one, or in the same hazard the ball was originally in.|$|R
50|$|A lander is a {{spacecraft}} which descends toward and <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> {{the surface of}} an astronomical body. By contrast with an impact probe, which makes a hard landing and is damaged or destroyed so ceases to function after reaching the surface, a lander makes a soft landing after which the probe remains functional.|$|R
25|$|The number 4 engine {{ripped through}} {{the roof of a}} cabinet shop in San Bruno. Slashing through a wooden beam, the jet engine then {{penetrated}} an 8-inch thick concrete wall, damaging equipment outside, and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> a mound of dirt. A large section of wing came down on Grand Avenue in South San Francisco, starting a grass fire. A 6-foot section of the wing hit the ground in Holy Cross cemetery and a charred chunk of the engine exhaust struck the rear of a housing area, also in South San Francisco. No injuries were reported.|$|E
25|$|Swiss International Air Lines Flight 850 (LX 850) was an {{international}} scheduled passenger flight from Basle, Switzerland, to Hamburg, Germany. On 10 July 2002, {{the flight was}} unable to land at Fuhlsbüttel Airport due to weather. Attempts were made to divert to other airports at Berlin and Eberswalde before the crew decided to land at Werneuchen. On landing, the aircraft struck an earth bank which ripped off all three undercarriage legs, and <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> its belly with an engine on fire. One of the sixteen passengers suffered minor injuries. The aircraft was written off.|$|E
25|$|Heart Mountain is an 8,123-foot (2,476 m) klippe {{just north}} of Cody in the U.S. state of Wyoming, rising {{from the floor of}} the Bighorn Basin. The {{mountain}} is composed of limestone and dolomite of Ordovician through Mississippian age (about 500 to 350 million years old), but it rests on the Willwood Formation, rocks that are about 55 million years old—rock on the summit of Heart Mountain is thus almost 300 million years older than the rocks at the base. For over one hundred years, geologists have tried to understand how these older rocks <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> much younger strata.|$|E
50|$|A {{dry dock}} (sometimes dry-dock or drydock) is a narrow basin or vessel {{that can be}} flooded to allow a load to be floated in, then drained to allow that load <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>rest</b> <b>on</b> a dry platform. Dry docks are used for the construction, maintenance, and repair of ships, boats, and other watercraft.|$|R
