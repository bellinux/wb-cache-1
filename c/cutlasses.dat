5|$|In {{addition}} to these gunnery drills, Broke was fond of preparing hypothetical scenarios to test his crew. For example, after all hands had been drummed to quarters, he would inform them of a theoretical attack {{and see how they}} would act to defend the ship. Though the use of <b>cutlasses</b> in training was avoided a method of swordsmanship training called 'singlestick' was regularly practised. This was a game employing roughly similar cuts, thrusts and parries as were used with the cutlass, but as it was played with wooden sticks with wicker hand guards; hits, although painful, were not often dangerous. It soon developed quickness of eye and wrist. Many of the crew became very expert.|$|E
5|$|In Puerto Rico {{there were}} many minor slave revolts in which the slaves clashed with the {{military}} establishment. In July 1821, Marcos Xiorro, a bozal slave, planned and organized a conspiracy against the slave masters and the colonial government of Puerto Rico. According to his plot, {{which was to be}} carried out on July 27, during the festival celebrations for Santiago (St. James), several slaves were to escape from various plantations in Bayamón, which included the haciendas of Angus McBean, C. Kortnight, Miguel Andino and Fernando Fernández. They were then to proceed to the sugarcane fields of Miguel Figueres, and retrieve <b>cutlasses</b> and swords which were hidden in those fields. Xiorro, together with a slave from the McBean plantation named Mario and another slave named Narciso, would lead the slaves of Bayamón and Toa Baja and capture the city of Bayamón. They would then burn the city and kill those who were not black. After this, they would all unite with slaves from the adjoining towns of Río Piedras, Guaynabo and Palo Seco. With this critical mass of slaves, all armed and emboldened from a series of quick victories, they would then invade the capital city of San Juan, where they would declare Xiorro as their king. Unfortunately for the slave conspirators, the plot was divulged by a fellow slave to the authorities.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Cutlass</b> Supreme was {{downsized}} for 1978, {{along with}} the rest of the <b>Cutlass</b> line. An upscale <b>Cutlass</b> Calais model was added, differing from the <b>Cutlass</b> Supreme only in minor trim details. The new notchback <b>Cutlass</b> Supreme proved to be far more popular than the controversial fastback <b>Cutlass</b> Salon coupe and sedan introduced at the same time.|$|R
50|$|Over {{time the}} <b>Cutlass</b> name {{accumulated}} great brand equity, becoming not only Oldsmobile's best-selling model {{but one of}} the most popular nameplates in the industry in the 1970s. By the 1980s, Oldsmobile was using the <b>Cutlass</b> as a sub-marque, with numerous vehicle lines bearing the name simultaneously. These included the <b>Cutlass</b> Calais compact, the midsize <b>Cutlass</b> Ciera, the <b>Cutlass</b> Cruiser station wagon, and top of the line midsize <b>Cutlass</b> Supreme.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Cutlass</b> {{line was}} {{redesigned}} for 1973 using GM's new [...] "Colonnade" [...] A-body platform. While rooflines were shared with other GM divisions, <b>Cutlass</b> bodies now sported convex bulges aft {{of the front}} wheel and fore of the rear wheel on all body styles. The model lineup consisted of the base <b>Cutlass,</b> <b>Cutlass</b> [...] "S", <b>Cutlass</b> Supreme, <b>Cutlass</b> Salon, Vista Cruiser station wagon, and the 4-4-2 appearance package on the <b>Cutlass</b> [...] "S" [...] colonnade coupe. The <b>Cutlass</b> [...] "S" [...] and 4-4-2 offered, as an extra-cost option, unique Strato bucket seats with high seatbacks and built-in head restraints that could be swiveled 90 degrees to permit easier entry and exit for the driver and front-seat passenger.|$|R
25|$|The conspirators {{intended}} to free prisoners, {{and with them}} take the viceroy hostage, proclaim the independence of Mexico, and declare war on Spain. To accomplish this, they were counting on 1,000 pesos of silver, two pistols, and some 50 <b>cutlasses</b> and machetes to initiate a popular uprising under the patronage of the Virgin of Guadalupe.|$|E

25|$|In the British forces {{they are}} also worn for any {{appearance}} at Court. In the United States, every Naval officer {{at or above the}} rank of Lieutenant Commander is required to own a sword, which can be prescribed for any formal outdoor ceremonial occasion; they are normally worn for changes of command and parades. For some Navy parades, <b>cutlasses</b> are issued to Petty Officers and Chief Petty Officers.|$|E
50|$|Until 1984, the deluxe <b>Cutlass</b> Supreme {{model was}} known as the <b>Cutlass</b> Calais. When the Calais {{nameplate}} moved to its own platform in 1985, the top Supreme was renamed to <b>Cutlass</b> Salon. As the new front-wheel drive <b>Cutlass</b> Supreme model was being launched in 1988, the rear-drive G-special coupe remained in production for one final model year as the <b>Cutlass</b> Supreme Classic.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Cutlass</b> became America's {{best selling}} car {{this year and}} would hold this title for most years into the 1980s. A restyled front end with waterfall-type split grilles and new {{rectangular}} headlights was introduced that would become an Olds <b>Cutlass</b> trademark in coming years, lasting into the late 1980s. Coupe bodies were reshaped for a smoother, less contoured look than the 1973-75 design, a design change shared with Buick's top line Regal. <b>Cutlass</b> four-door sedans and wagons kept their bulges {{through the end of}} model year 1977. Taillights were revised and the license plate/fuel filler was moved above the bumper. The base <b>Cutlass</b> line was dropped, with the <b>Cutlass</b> S nameplate now applied to the entry-level coupe and sedan this year - both of which featured an aerodynamic slanted front nose in contrast to the upright front ends of other <b>Cutlass</b> models including the <b>Cutlass</b> Supreme coupe, sedan and wagon, Vista Cruiser wagon, <b>Cutlass</b> Salon coupe and sedan, and the new <b>Cutlass</b> Supreme Brougham coupe. The 4-4-2 option was still offered on <b>Cutlass</b> S coupes as an appearance/handling package.|$|R

25|$|Oldsmobile F-85 (1961–1972) - compact sedan, coupe and {{station wagon}} {{powered by a}} 215CID {{aluminum}} block V8 engine from 1961 to 1963. In 1964 the F-85 was upgraded to an intermediate sized car and the aluminum V8 was replaced by conventional cast-iron six-cylinder and V8 engines. The Cutlass was initially the top model of the F-85 line but became a separate model by 1964 with the F-85 nameplate continued only on the lowest priced models through the 1972 model year, after which all Oldsmobile intermediates were <b>Cutlasses.</b>|$|E
25|$|In June 1900, {{early in}} the Boxer Rebellion, Keyes led a mission to capture a {{flotilla}} of four Chinese destroyers moored to a wharf on the Peiho River. Together with another junior officer, he took boarding parties onto the Chinese destroyers, captured the destroyers and secured the wharf. Shortly thereafter he led a mission to capture the heavily fortified fort at Hsi-cheng: he loaded HMS Fame with a landing party of 32 men, armed with rifles, pistols, <b>cutlasses</b> and explosives. His men quickly destroyed the Chinese gun mountings, blew up the powder magazine {{and returned to the}} ship.|$|E
50|$|The third <b>Cutlass</b> {{nameplate}} introduced was {{the compact}} <b>Cutlass</b> Calais (originally just Oldsmobile Calais) on the front-wheel-drive N-body in 1985. The famed 4-4-2 nameplate was revived for the <b>Cutlass</b> Calais in 1990 and 1991.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Cutlass</b> Ciera {{shared the}} <b>Cutlass</b> {{nameplate}} with the smaller <b>Cutlass</b> Calais {{and the larger}} <b>Cutlass</b> Supreme. It shared the same engines and certain interior features with the Buick Century. The car enjoyed many factory specialty models including the Holiday coupe, GT, pace car, and International models - the latter of which had a stock body kit.|$|R
25|$|Oldsmobile <b>Cutlass</b> Supreme (1966–1997) - more {{performance}} and luxury than the lower priced <b>Cutlass</b> and <b>Cutlass</b> S models, fitting {{in at the}} lower end of the personal luxury car market.

25|$|In 1799 a {{conspiracy}} was discovered. Pedro de la Portilla, a Criollo employee {{in the tax}} collectors' office, met with about twenty youths in the Alley of the Gachupines (Spurs) in Mexico City. The meeting discussed the situation Criollos found themselves in relation to Peninsulares. (Criollos were Europeans born in the New World, and Peninsulares were Europeans born in Iberia. Gachupines became an insulting term for Peninsulares.) Those present agreed to rise in arms to rid the country of the Gachupines. For this purpose, they assembled a number of old <b>cutlasses.</b> As this was almost their only armament, the conspiracy {{became known as the}} Conspiracy of the Machetes.|$|E
25|$|A colonial {{police force}} was {{established}} in the 1840s to handle the high crime rate in Hong Kong. By China's standards, colonial Hong Kong's code of punishment was considered laughably loose and lenient. The lack of intimidation may have been the leading cause for the continual rise in crime. Po Leung Kuk {{became one of the first}} organisations established to deal with the abduction of women and prostitution crisis. Crime at sea was also common as some pirates had access to <b>cutlasses</b> and revolvers. Court sessions for criminal and admiralty matters were first held on 4March 1844 under the aegis of the first governor, Lieutenant General Sir Henry Pottinger and the Lieutenant-governor George D'Aguilar.|$|E
25|$|Thompson commandeered the {{government}} brig, {{which was in}} Nelson at the time. On the morning of 17 June the party, its size swelled to between 49 and 60 men, including chief surveyor Frederick Tuckett and others who had joined the party after landing, approached the Māori camp. The New Zealand Company's storekeeper James Howard issued the British men with <b>cutlasses,</b> bayonets, pistols and muskets. At the path {{on the other side}} of a stream, Te Rauparaha stood surrounded by about 90 warriors, as well as by women and children. He allowed Thompson and five other men to approach him, but requested the rest of the British party to remain on their side of the stream.|$|E

25|$|However, swords {{were still}} used in combat, {{especially}} in Colonial Wars between native populations and Colonial Empires. For example, during the Aceh War the Acehnese Klewangs, a sword {{similar to the}} machete, proved very effective in close quarters combat with Dutch troops, leading the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army to adopt a heavy cutlass, also called klewang (very similar in appearance to the US Navy Model 1917 Cutlass) to counter it. Mobile troops armed with carbines and klewangs succeeded in suppressing Aceh resistance where traditional infantry with rifle and bayonet had failed. From that time on until the 1950s the Royal Dutch East Indies Army, Royal Dutch Army, Royal Dutch Navy and Dutch police used these <b>cutlasses</b> called Klewang.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{being in}} the majority, none of the loyalists put up a {{significant}} struggle once they saw Bligh bound, and the ship was taken over without bloodshed. The mutineers provided Bligh and eighteen loyal crewmen a 23-foot (7m) launch (so heavily loaded that the gunwales {{were only a few}} inches above the water). They were allowed four <b>cutlasses,</b> food and water for perhaps a week, a quadrant and a compass, but no charts, or marine chronometer. Most of these were obtained by the clerk, Mr Samuel, who acted with great calm and resolution, despite threats from the mutineers. The launch could not hold all the loyal crew members, so four were detained on Bounty for their useful skills; they were later released in Tahiti.|$|E

5000|$|One of Oldsmobile {{best known}} brands was [...] "Cutlass". First used in 1961, by the 1980s it was confusingly used on three {{different}} platforms, with the Oldsmobile <b>Cutlass</b> Ciera becoming Oldsmobile's best selling model which {{at different times}} would be sold alongside the smaller <b>Cutlass</b> Calais, and a newer <b>Cutlass</b> Supreme. The Aurora-inspired Intrigue introduced in 1988 retired the aging <b>Cutlass</b> nameplate with the intention to recast Oldsmobile into a future as in import fighter and its stodgy past as existing model names which {{had served in the}} past including <b>Cutlass</b> were phased out. But sales would continue to decline, as <b>Cutlass</b> briefly re-appeared as a rebadged Malibu in 1997. To reduce costs at General Motors by consolidating a profusion of divisions, the Oldsmobile division was entirely phased out in 2004.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Cutlass</b> line {{soon became}} Oldsmobile's biggest seller, {{accounting}} for 43% of the division's total volume in 1974, with the <b>Cutlass</b> Supreme coupe being {{the single most}} popular model. With rectangular headlights newly legalized in 1975, the <b>Cutlass</b> received a facelift for the 1976 model year featuring quad headlights and a waterfall grille. This attractive redesign boosted sales even further. The <b>Cutlass</b> line {{as a whole was}} America's best-selling car in 1976, helping Oldsmobile to become the only marque outside of Ford and Chevrolet to break one-million units sold. By 1977, however, GM had downsized its full-size models, and the <b>Cutlass</b> Supreme was now nearly identical in size to the redesigned Delta 88. That situation would last only that one year, as GM planned to downsize the Olds <b>Cutlass</b> and other intermediates for 1978.|$|R
50|$|The 1985 <b>Cutlass</b> Supreme was {{produced}} by Oldsmobile and designed after the Oldsmobile Calais, which became a separate model on the GM N platform in the same year. The rear-wheel drive <b>Cutlass</b> Calais was renamed the <b>Cutlass</b> Salon (taking {{its name from the}} upscale Supreme coupe and sedan that preceded the Calais).|$|R
25|$|On 11 February 1842, {{with the}} {{principal}} officers of the schooner on shore, a number of seamen who had been drinking demanded they {{be allowed to go}} ashore. The Officer of the Watch, Lieutenant Charles Fuller, ordered the marine guard to defend the ship, only to have the sergeant of marines, Seymour Oswald, strike him on the head with a tomahawk. Fuller drew his Colt revolver, and in the melee that followed, Fuller was shot dead and his body was beaten with muskets and <b>cutlasses.</b> Two midshipmen were also injured, and another lieutenant was locked below deck. The mutineers fled from the ship, but they soon were apprehended by the United States revenue cutter Jackson and placed in the New Orleans jail. Two of the mutinous sailors were returned to the ship, while the rest remained in New Orleans, pending extradition.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April 1810, while off Falerna, Ayscough {{observed}} two 100-ton settees being {{loaded on}} the beach. He immediately sent the ship's boats {{under the command}} of Lieutenant George Sartorius, accompanied by the boats of , {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Robert Oliver. Unfortunately three of the boats were swamped close to shore when they struck a hidden reef, and two men from Espoir were lost. The rest of the men swam ashore, but their powder now being wet, were only armed with <b>cutlasses.</b> The British came under fire from two long 6-pounders concealed behind some rocks, but nevertheless drove off the enemy, spiked the guns and set the ships on fire, before righting their boats and returning to the ships for the loss of only two men killed. Later, on 20 April, two sloops were captured and scuttled off Ischia.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, Porter's gunboats {{opened fire}} on the sea face of the fort and by noon they succeeded in {{silencing}} all but four guns. During this bombardment Hoke sent about 1,000 troops from his line to Fort Fisher, however only about 400 were able to land and {{make it into the}} defense while the others were forced to turn back. Around this time the sailors and marines, led by Lieutenant Commander Kidder Breese, landed and moved against the point where the fort's land and sea faces met, a feature known as the Northeast Bastion. The Union Army's original plan was for the naval force, armed with revolvers and <b>cutlasses,</b> to attack in three waves with the marines providing covering fire, but instead, the assault went forward in a single unorganized mass. General Whiting personally led the defense and routed the assault, with heavy casualties in the naval force.|$|E
