5|$|At the Paris Air Show in June 2011, Hong Kong Airlines had {{announced}} a signed contract for 10 Airbus A380's however due to China's anger with the European Union over plans to force all airlines {{to take part}} in its carbon-trading scheme, the Chinese government has blocked progress on Airbus’s sale of 10 A380s to Hong Kong Airlines. Normally, airlines in Hong Kong are not required to seek approval from the Chinese government to proceed with aircraft orders. The A380 cancellation became an issue as Hong Kong Airlines' parent, Hainan Airlines, is registered in mainland China, not Hong Kong SAR. In early January 2012, HKA's <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> head Kenneth Thong stated in a TV interview that the order was going ahead.|$|E

For t-test independent, the first and the second test to director, shows significant result. It is not different from test result for commisioner. However, the test result for independence director shows the inconsistence result, which there is the significant result in first test, but insignificant result in the second test.

The results show that an increase {{on the number of}} independent boards is associated with higher liquidity. In addition, the results show that there was a significant relationship between liquidity and ownership structure. In other words, the relationships between liquidity and individual investors and five biggest investors are positive and the relationships between liquidity and institutional ownership and the biggest investor ownership are negative. In addition, there is not a significant relationship between liquidity and duality of managers...|$|R

25|$|<b>Corporate</b> <b>governance</b> is the mechanisms, {{processes}} and relations by which corporations are controlled and directed. Governance structures and principles identify {{the distribution of}} rights and responsibilities among different participants in the corporation (such as the board of directors, managers, shareholders, creditors, auditors, regulators, and other stakeholders) and includes the rules and procedures for making decisions in corporate affairs. <b>Corporate</b> <b>governance</b> includes the processes through which corporations' objectives are set and pursued {{in the context of}} the social, regulatory and market environment. Governance mechanisms include monitoring the actions, policies, practices, and decisions of corporations, their agents, and affected stakeholders. <b>Corporate</b> <b>governance</b> practices are affected by attempts to align the interests of stakeholders. Interest in the <b>corporate</b> <b>governance</b> practices of modern corporations, particularly in relation to accountability, increased following the high-profile collapses of a number of large corporations during 2001–2002, most of which involved accounting fraud; and then again after the recent financial crisis in 2008.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{corporations}} would be redefined in this millennium. Instead of only maximizing the shareholder value, the corporate goal would be enlarged to encompass maximizing green stakeholder value as well. Corporations would increasingly recognize the multiple environmental stakeholder groups involved in <b>corporate</b> environmental <b>governance.</b> Barely ten years ago, the stakeholders for corporations were fairly well defined. They were local, state and federal regulatory agencies- those who issue permits, monitored compliance, and if necessary, issue notices of violations and fines. <b>Corporate</b> environmental <b>governance</b> is all about conducting the corporate environmental affairs of a company {{in such a way}} as to meet and exceed the expectations of all environmental stakeholders. These stakeholder groups comprise regulators, governments, financial institutions, end-use consumers, employees and local community. In order to improve corporate relationships with the various stakeholder groups, organizations need to identify and assess their environmental concerns.
