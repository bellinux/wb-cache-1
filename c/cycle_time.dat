40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} simulation for analyzing cluster tool <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> and cluster tool capacity planning. The objective of this project {{was to develop a}} flexible and expandable tool for rapidly calculating tool <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> for a multiple step process through alternative tool configurations. The calculated process <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> are then used to calculate equipment tool set requirements against product demand. The Seagate Industrial Engineering group utilized a simulation based cluster tool model developed to predict cluster tool <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> and analyze cluster tool capacity across multiple tools and compare with results from static probability based model predictions. ...|$|R
40|$|In current research, {{the minimum}} <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> of finite state {{machines}} are estimated by computing the delays of the combinational logic in the finite state machines. Even though these methods deal with false paths, they ignore the sequential and periodic nature of minimum <b>cycle</b> <b>times,</b> and hence may give pessimistic results. In this paper, we first prove {{conditions under which}} combinational delays are correct upper bounds on minimum <b>cycle</b> <b>times.</b> Then, we present a sequential approach to compute the minimum <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> of finite state machines, {{taking into account the}} effects of gate delay variations, reachable state space, initial states, unrealizable transitions, multiple cycle false paths, and periodicity of the present state vector sequences. We formulate and solve the problem exactly using Timed Boolean Functions, and give an efficient algorithm to solve for upper bounds of minimum <b>cycle</b> <b>times.</b> The exact formulation with Timed Boolean Functions provides a framework for further improvements on existing algorithms to compute the minimum <b>cycle</b> <b>times.</b> We implemented the algorithm and obtained the tightest bounds known on ISCAS benchmarks. From the experiments, we found that for about 20 % of the circuits (not all shown in section 8), combinational delays, e. g. floating, viability, and transition delays, give pessimistic upper bounds for <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> by as much as 25 %. ...|$|R
5|$|The most {{important}} material properties for the dies are thermal shock resistance and softening at elevated temperature; other important properties include hardenability, machinability, heat checking resistance, weldability, availability (especially for larger dies), and cost. The longevity of a die is directly {{dependent on the}} temperature of the molten metal and the <b>cycle</b> <b>time.</b> The dies used in die casting are usually made out of hardened tool steels, because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved, therefore the dies are very expensive, resulting in high start-up costs. Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher alloy steels.|$|E
5|$|These {{are used}} when the casting alloy {{cannot be used}} in hot-chamber machines; these include aluminium, zinc alloys with a large {{composition}} of aluminium, magnesium and copper. The process for these machines start with melting the metal in a separate furnace. Then a precise amount of molten metal is transported to the cold-chamber machine where it is fed into an unheated shot chamber (or injection cylinder). This shot is then driven into the die by a hydraulic or mechanical piston. The biggest disadvantage of this system is the slower <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> due {{to the need to}} transfer the molten metal from the furnace to the cold-chamber machine.|$|E

Here we show that when we extract <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> from 100 sets of paired random series, we find six distinct clusters of common <b>cycle</b> <b>times</b> ranging from about 3 years to about 32 years. <b>Cycle</b> <b>times,</b> CT, get shorter when one series in a pair is an increasingly stronger leading series, measured as LL-strength, to the other, CT ≈ - (minus) LL-strength.

25|$|Hydrogen peroxide, in both {{liquid and}} as vaporized {{hydrogen}} peroxide (VHP), is another chemical sterilizing agent. Hydrogen peroxide is strong oxidant, which {{allows it to}} destroy {{a wide range of}} pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide is used to sterilize heat or temperature sensitive articles such as rigid endoscopes. In medical sterilization hydrogen peroxide is used at higher concentrations, ranging from around 35% up to 90%. The biggest advantage of hydrogen peroxide as a sterilant is the short <b>cycle</b> <b>time.</b> Whereas the <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> for ethylene oxide may be 10 to 15 hours, some modern hydrogen peroxide sterilizers have a <b>cycle</b> <b>time</b> as short as 28 minutes.|$|E

25|$|Metrics {{applicable}} to the ED can be grouped into three main categories, volume, <b>cycle</b> <b>time,</b> and patient satisfaction. Volume metrics including arrivals per hour, percentage of ED beds occupied and age of patients are understood at a basic level at all hospitals as an indication for staffing requirements. <b>Cycle</b> <b>time</b> metrics are the mainstays of the evaluation and tracking of process efficiency and are less widespread since an active effort is needed to collect and analyze this data. Patient satisfaction metrics, already commonly collected by nursing groups, physician groups and hospitals, are useful in demonstrating the impact of changes in patient perception of care over time. Since patient satisfaction metrics are derivative and subjective, they are less useful in primary process improvement. Health information exchanges can reduce nonurgent ED visits by supplying current data about admissions, discharges, and transfers to health plans and accountable care organizations, allowing them to shift ED use to primary care settings.|$|E
