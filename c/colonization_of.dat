5|$|Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} skin {{disease of the}} pilosebaceous unit and {{develops}} due to blockages in the skin's hair follicles.

5|$|The {{range of}} the North American river otter has been {{significantly}} reduced by habitat loss, beginning with the European <b>colonization</b> <b>of</b> North America. In some regions, though, their population is controlled to allow the trapping and harvesting of otters for their pelts.

A number of reintroduction projects have been initiated to help stabilize the reduction in the overall population.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} {{astronomer}} Steven J. Dick at the United States Naval Observatory considered the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact by analyzing events of similar {{significance in the}} history of science. The study argues that the impact would be most strongly influenced by the information content of the message received, if any. It distinguishes short-term and long-term impact. Seeing radio-based contact as a more plausible scenario than a visit from extraterrestrial spacecraft, the study rejects the commonly stated analogy of European <b>colonization</b> <b>of</b> the Americas as an accurate model for information-only contact, preferring events of profound scientific significance, such as the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions, as more predictive of how humanity might be impacted by extraterrestrial contact.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conjecture}} is {{that the}} breed is descended from the 89horses brought to the islands in 1526 by Spanish explorer Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón. His attempted <b>colonization</b> <b>of</b> San Miguel de Gualdape (near the Santee River in South Carolina) failed, forcing the colonists to move, possibly to North Carolina. Vázquez de Ayllón and about 450 of the original 600colonists subsequently {{died as a result}} of desertion, disease, and an early frost. Lacking effective leadership, the new settlement lasted for only two months; the survivors abandoned the colony and fled to Hispaniola, leaving their horses behind.|$|E

5|$|Deterioration of whale {{carcasses}} happens {{though a}} series of three stages. Initially, moving organisms such as sharks and hagfish, scavenge the soft tissues at a rapid rate over a period of months, and as long as two years. This is followed by the <b>colonization</b> <b>of</b> bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as crustaceans and polychaetes, throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing hydrogen sulfide enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms, which in turn, support other organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets, and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 species per site.|$|E
5|$|In {{its role}} {{supporting}} <b>colonization</b> <b>of</b> New Netherland, the West India Company had {{an executive board}} of nine members from the College of XIX to manage the concerns of their colony. Van Rensselaer was {{also a member of}} this group. In the early career of the Company, Van Rensselaer was one of its mainstays, placing several of his vessels at its disposal and twice advancing money to save its credit. His name is conspicuously identified with all its measures of policy, including the original settlement of Manhattan Island, New Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|Lemuriforms are {{currently}} {{thought to have}} evolved in Africa, and the earliest known strepsirrhine primates from Africa are azibiids from the early Eocene, which likely descended from a very early <b>colonization</b> <b>of</b> the Afro-Arabian land mass in the Paleocene (66 to 55mya). Stem lemuriforms, including Djebelemur and 'Anchomomys' milleri, {{have been found in}} Africa and date from 50 to 48 mya and were very distinct from European adapiforms. However, they lack a toothcomb. These stem lemuriforms suggest an early common ancestry with cercamoniines from outside of Europe. Based on large, procumbent lower teeth, Plesiopithecus, a fossil primate found in late Eocene deposits at the Fayum Depression in Egypt, is thought to be most closely related to lemuriforms. Together, Djebelemur, ‘Anchomomys’ milleri, and Plesiopithecus are considered to be sister taxa (the closest relatives) of lemuriform primates.|$|E

5|$|Rhodotus palmatus is saprobic, {{meaning it}} obtains {{nutrients}} from decomposing organic matter. It grows scattered or clustered {{in small groups}} on rotting hardwoods, such as basswood, maple, and especially elm; in Europe it is known to grow on horse chestnut. The mushroom prefers low-lying logs {{in areas that are}} periodically flooded and that receive little sunlight, such as areas shaded by forest canopy. A pioneer species in the fungal <b>colonization</b> <b>of</b> dead wood, it prefers to grow on relatively undecayed substrates. It is often found growing on dark-stained wood, especially the dried-out upper parts of trunks that have lost their bark. R. palmatus tends to fruit in cooler and moister weather, from spring to autumn in the United States, or autumn to winter in Britain and Europe.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1820s, Oregon City {{developed}} near Willamette Falls. It {{was incorporated}} in 1844, {{becoming the first}} city west of the Rocky Mountains to have that distinction.

McLoughlin attempted to persuade the British government (which still held sway over the area) to allow American settlers to live on the land, and provided significant help to American <b>colonization</b> <b>of</b> the area, all against the HBC's orders. Oregon City prospered because of the paper mills that were run by the water power of Willamette Falls, but the falls formed an impassable barrier to river navigation. Linn City (originally Robins Nest) was established across the Willamette from Oregon City.|$|E
