25|$|Diagnosis {{is usually}} made by rectal palpation. Treatment {{includes}} fluid therapy and analgesics, but surgery is indicated {{if there is}} severe distention of the cecum or if medical therapy does not improve the situation. Surgery includes typhlotomy, and although <b>cecal</b> bypass has been performed {{in the past to}} prevent reoccurrence, a recent study suggests it is not necessary. Surgery has a good prognosis, although rupture can occur during surgical manipulation. The cause of <b>cecal</b> impactions are not known. <b>Cecal</b> impassion should be differentiated from large colon impaction via rectal, since <b>cecal</b> impaction has a high risk of rupture even before developing severe pain. Overall prognosis is 90%, regardless of medical or surgical treatment, but rupture does occur, often with no warning.|$|E
25|$|A further {{factor is}} an {{increase}} in the bacterial mass and activity of the ileum as some fibers e.g., pectin are digested by bacteria. The bacterial mass increases and <b>cecal</b> bacterial activity increases.|$|E
25|$|Some non-absorbed carbohydrates, e.g. pectin, gum arabic, {{oligosaccharides}} and resistant starch, are fermented to short-chain {{fatty acids}} (chiefly acetic, propionic and n-butyric), and carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. The <b>cecal</b> fermentation of 40–50g of complex polysaccharides will yield 400–500mmol total short-chain fatty acids, 240–300mmol acetate, and 80–100mmol of both propionate and butyrate. Almost {{all of these}} short-chain fatty acids will be absorbed from the colon. This means that fecal short-chain fatty acid estimations do not reflect <b>cecal</b> and colonic fermentation, only the efficiency of absorption, {{the ability of the}} fiber residue to sequestrate short-chain fatty acids, and the continued fermentation of fiber around the colon, which presumably will continue until the substrate is exhausted.|$|E
25|$|Enlargement of the cecum is {{a common}} finding when some dietary fibers are fed and this is now {{believed}} to be normal physiological adjustment. Such an increase {{may be due to}} a number of factors, prolonged <b>cecal</b> residence of the fiber, increased bacterial mass, or increased bacterial end-products.|$|E
25|$|Only 5% {{of large}} {{intestinal}} impactions at referral hospital are involve the cecum. Primary <b>cecal</b> impactions usually consist of dry feed material, with the horse slowly developing clinical signs over several days. Secondary <b>cecal</b> impactions may occur post-surgery, orthopedic or otherwise, and the cecum does not function properly. Horses usually show clinical signs 3–5 days post general anesthesia, including decreased appetite, decreased manure production, and {{gas in the}} cecum which can be auscultated. The cecum quickly distends due to fluid and gas accumulation, often leading to rupture within 24–48 hours if not corrected. This impaction may be missed since decreased manure production can be attributed secondarily to surgery, and often rupture occurs before severe signs of pain. Horses are most at risk {{for this type of}} impaction if surgery is greater than 1 hour in length, or if inadequate analgesia is provided postoperatively.|$|E
25|$|In a {{more recent}} paper, the {{appendix}} {{was found to have}} evolved at least 32 times (and perhaps as many as 38 times) and to have been lost no more than six times. This suggests that the <b>cecal</b> appendix has a selective advantage in many situations and argues strongly against its vestigial nature. This complex evolutionary history of the appendix, along with a great heterogeneity in its evolutionary rate in various taxa, suggests that it is a recurrent trait.|$|E
25|$|Large {{intestinal}} ileus is {{most commonly}} seen in horses following orthopedic surgery, but its risk is also increased {{in cases where}} post-operative pain is not well-controlled, after long surgeries, and possibly following ophthalmologic surgeries. It is characterized by decreased manure output (<3 piles per day), rather than nasogastric reflux, as well as decreased gut sounds, signs of colic, and the occasional impaction of the cecum or large colon. <b>Cecal</b> impactions can be fatal, so {{care must be taken}} to monitor the horse for large intestinal ileus after orthopedic surgery, primarily by watching for decreased manure production.|$|E
25|$|Rectal {{examinations}} are {{a cornerstone}} of colic diagnosis, as many large intestinal conditions can be definitively diagnosed by this method alone. Due {{to the risk of}} harm to the horse, a rectal examination is performed by a veterinarian. Approximately 40% of the gastrointestinal tract can be examined by rectal palpation, although this can vary based {{on the size of the}} horse and the length of the examiner's arm. Structures that can be identified include the aorta, caudal pole of the left kidney, nephrosplenic ligament, caudal border of the spleen, ascending colon (left dorsal and ventral, pelvic flexure), the small intestine if distended (it is not normally palpable on rectal), the mesenteric root, the base of the cecum and the medial <b>cecal</b> band, and rarely the inguinal rings. The location within the colon is identified based on size, presence of sacculations, number of bands, and if fecal balls are present.|$|E
25|$|Three morphotypes of cecal-appendices can be {{described}} among mammals based primarily on {{the shape of the}} cecum: a distinct appendix branching from a rounded or sac-like cecum (as in many primate species), an appendix located at the apex of a long and voluminous cecum (as in the rabbit, greater glider and Cape dune mole rat), and an appendix {{in the absence of a}} pronounced cecum (as in the wombat). In addition, long narrow appendix-like structures are found in mammals that either lack an apparent cecum (as in monotremes) or lack a distinct junction between the cecum and appendix-like structure (as in the koala). A <b>cecal</b> appendix has evolved independently at least twice, and apparently represents yet another example of convergence in morphology between Australian marsupials and placentals in the rest of the world. Although the appendix has apparently been lost by numerous species, it has also been maintained for more than 80 million years in at least one clade.|$|E
2500|$|The {{appendix}} (or vermiform appendix; also <b>cecal</b> [...] appendix; vermix; or vermiform process) is a blind-ended tube {{connected to}} the cecum, from which it develops in the embryo. The cecum is a pouchlike structure of the colon, located at the junction of the small and the large intestines.|$|E
2500|$|Recently ... {{improved}} {{understanding of}} gut immunity has merged with current thinking in biological and medical science, pointing to an apparent {{function of the}} mammalian <b>cecal</b> appendix as a safe-house for symbiotic gut microbes, preserving the flora during times of gastrointestinal infection in societies without modern medicine. This function is potentially a selective force for the evolution and maintenance of the appendix.|$|E
2500|$|In the photo, an {{apparent}} field defect {{in this segment}} of a colon has generated four polyps (labeled {{with the size of}} the polyps, 6mm, 5mm, and two of 3mm, and a cancer about 3cm across in its longest dimension). These neoplasms are also indicated, in the diagram below the photo, by 4 small tan circles (polyps) and a larger red area (cancer). [...] The cancer in the photo occurred in the <b>cecal</b> area of the colon, where the colon joins the small intestine (labeled) and where the appendix occurs (labeled). [...] The fat in the photo is external to the outer wall of the colon. [...] In the segment of colon shown here, the colon was cut open lengthwise to expose the inner surface of the colon and to display the cancer and polyps occurring within the inner epithelial lining of the colon.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{surgical}} procedures {{have been developed}} to create a neovagina, as none of them is ideal. [...] Surgical intervention should be considered only after non-surgical pressure dilation methods have failed to produce a satisfactory result. [...] Neovaginoplasty can be performed using skin grafts, a segment of bowel, ileum, peritoneum, , buccal mucosa, amnion, or dura mater. [...] Success of such methods should be determined by sexual function, and not by vaginal length alone, as has been done in the past. [...] Ileal or <b>cecal</b> segments may be problematic because of a shorter mesentery, which may produce tension on the neovagina, leading to stenosis. [...] The sigmoid neovagina is thought to be self-lubricating, without the excess mucus production associated with segments of small bowel. [...] Vaginoplasty may create scarring at the introitus (the vaginal opening), requiring additional surgery to correct. [...] Vaginal dilators are required postoperatively to prevent vaginal stenosis from scarring. [...] Other complications include bladder and bowel injuries. [...] Yearly exams are required, as neovaginoplasty carries a risk of carcinoma, although carcinoma of the neovagina is uncommon. [...] Neither neovaginoplasty nor vaginal dilation should be performed before puberty.|$|E
2500|$|In the colon, a field defect {{probably}} arises {{by natural}} selection of a mutant or epigenetically altered cell among the stem cells {{at the base of}} one of the intestinal crypts on the inside surface of the colon. A mutant or epigenetically altered stem cell may replace the other nearby stem cells {{by natural selection}}. This may cause a patch of abnormal tissue to arise. [...] The figure in this section includes a photo of a freshly resected and lengthwise-opened segment of the colon showing a colon cancer and four polyps. [...] Below the photo there is a schematic diagram of how a large patch of mutant or epigenetically altered cells may have formed, shown by the large area in yellow in the diagram. [...] Within this first large patch in the diagram (a large clone of cells), a second such mutation or epigenetic alteration may occur so that a given stem cell acquires an advantage compared to other stem cells within the patch, and this altered stem cell may expand clonally forming a secondary patch, or sub-clone, within the original patch. This is indicated in the diagram by four smaller patches of different colors within the large yellow original area. Within these new patches (sub-clones), the process may be repeated multiple times, indicated by the still smaller patches within the four secondary patches (with still different colors in the diagram) which clonally expand, until stem cells arise that generate either small polyps or else a malignant neoplasm (cancer). In the photo, an apparent field defect in this segment of a colon has generated four polyps (labeled with the size of the polyps, 6mm, 5mm, and two of 3mm, and a cancer about 3cm across in its longest dimension).

5000|$|Another {{difference}} {{found between}} the two populations was the discovery, in the Mrčaru lizards, of <b>cecal</b> valves, which slow down food passage and provide fermenting chambers, allowing commensal microorganisms to convert cellulose to nutrients digestible by the lizards. Additionally, the researchers discovered that nematodes were common in the guts of Mrčaru lizards, but absent from Kopište P. sicula, which do not have <b>cecal</b> valves. The <b>cecal</b> valves, which occur in less than 1 percent of all known species of scaled reptiles, {{have been described as}} an [...] "adaptive novelty, a brand new feature not present in the ancestral population and newly evolved in these lizards".|$|E
50|$|<b>Cecal</b> bascule is a {{cause of}} large bowel {{obstruction}} where there is folding of the cecum anteriorly over the ascending colon. It {{is one of two}} types of <b>cecal</b> volvulus, the other being axial ileocolic. It is caused by rotational torsion of the cecum or ascending colon along its own axis. In <b>cecal</b> bascule, the base of the cecum folds anteriorly over the ascending colon, creating a flap-valve, obstructing emptying of the cecum. The condition can be complicated by necrosis or organ perforation before the diagnosis is made, particularly if the ileocecal valve is competent, preventing retrograde decompression of the cecum into the ileum.|$|E

5000|$|Hindgut fermenters are {{subdivided}} {{into two groups}} based on the relative size of various digestive organs {{in relationship to the}} rest of the system: colonic fermenters tend to be larger species such as horses, and <b>cecal</b> fermenters are smaller animals such as rabbits and rodents. [...] However, in spite of the terminology, colonic fermenters such as horses make extensive use of the cecum to break down cellulose. Also, colonic fermenters typically have a proportionally longer large intestine than small intestine, whereas <b>cecal</b> fermenters have a considerably enlarged cecum compared {{to the rest of the}} digestive tract.|$|E

50|$|Histomoniasis is {{characterized}} by blackhead in birds. H. meleagridis is released in the cecum where the eggs of the nematode undergo larval development. The parasite migrates to the mucosa and submucosa where they cause extensive and severe necrosis of the tissue. Necrosis is initiated by inflammation and gradual ulceration, causing thickening of the <b>cecal</b> wall. The lesions are sometimes exacerbated by other pathogens such as Escherichia coli and coccidia. Histomonads then gain entry into small veins of the blood stream from the <b>cecal</b> lesions and migrate to the liver, causing focal necrosis. Turkeys are noted to be most susceptible to the symptoms in terms of mortality, sometimes approaching 100% of a flock. Diagnosis can be easily performed by necropsy of the fresh or preserved carcass. Unusual lesions have been observed in other organs of turkey such as the bursa of Fabricius, lungs, and kidneys.|$|E
50|$|The link {{to stress}} {{suggests}} the condition may be {{brought on by}} changes in the microflora of the cecum and colon that lower the number of anaerobic bacteria, {{increase the number of}} Gram-negative enteric bacteria, and decrease anaerobic fermentation of soluble carbohydrates, resulting in damage to the <b>cecal</b> and colonic mucosa and allowing increased absorption of endotoxins from the lumen of the gut.|$|E
