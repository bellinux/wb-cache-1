50|$|All modern roller {{coasters}} have up-stop wheels that hug {{the bottom of}} the rail. As their name implies, they prevent the train from <b>coming</b> up <b>off</b> the track. Side friction wheels hug the sides of the rail, either the outside or inside, depending on the track manufacturer. These wheels help the train stay {{in the center of the}} two rails to keep the train from derailing. The last wheel set are called tractor wheels, or running wheels. Tractor wheels have a simple but important purpose. These wheels bear the weight of the train on the track, keeping the train running on the track. Tractor wheels may lift off the track in when the vertical g-force is zero or negative, but the up-stop wheels keep the train from <b>coming</b> completely <b>off</b> the rails.|$|R
