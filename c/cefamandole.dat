50|$|H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius is {{currently}} susceptible {{to a number}} of antibiotics. These include ampicillin, chloramphenicol, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, <b>cefamandole,</b> cefuroxime, cefotaxime, tetracycline, ceftriaxone and rifampin. Health officials are hesitant in using systemic antibiotics like rifampin. Although they may help in treating the BPF clone, more studies should be done before this antibiotic is applied to more cases. Premature use of this antibiotic without further studies (and the use of rifampin to treat sporadic cases) could result in a potential development of resistance and excessive expenses.It is important to distinguish between H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius and the clone referred to as the “BPF clone.” The non-clone, typical version of H. aegyptius manifests itself in non-invasive conjunctivitis. The epidemic nature of this bacteria has been seen in the high frequency of “control” subjects from the affected areas of Brazil that have or had recently had conjunctivitis. These control subjects did not develop Brazilian Purpuric Fever, and therefore were probably not carrying the more dangerous BPF clone of H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius.

After a 1 -g, 20 -min intravenous (i. v.) infusion, the average peak blood level of <b>cefamandole</b> was 87. 6 versus 64. 1 μg/ml for cephalothin. An i. v. infusion of 500 mg/h for 2 h (after a loading dose of 750 mg) gave an average steady-state blood level of 28. 5 μg/ml for <b>cefamandole</b> and 18. 2 μg/ml for cephalothin. Mean peak serum levels after 1 g intramuscularly were similar {{for the two}} antibiotics (about 21 μg/ml), but with <b>cefamandole</b> they persisted longer, and the area under the blood level curve was about 25 % greater. The average t½ as determined from both i. v. studies was 34 min for <b>cefamandole</b> versus 30 min for cephalothin. The mean serum clearance for cephalothin, due to its partial conversion to a metabolite, was much greater than for <b>cefamandole</b> (425 versus 272 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2), but the renal clearances were similar for the two antibiotics (268 versus 257 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2). Other values for <b>cefamandole</b> and cephalothin were: 24 -h urinary excretion, 80 and 66 %; serum protein binding, 74 and 70 %; and apparent volume of distribution, 12. 8 and 18. 5 liters/ 1. 73 m 2, respectively. Thus, the pharmacology of the two antibiotics was similar. Blood levels were somewhat higher with <b>cefamandole</b> i. v., but {{the results suggest that}} dosage regimens should be the same for the two antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{potential}} for an interaction between cephalosporins and aminoglycosides leading to renal injury, an evaluation of the effect of a new cephalosporin, <b>cefamandole</b> nafate, on the toxicity of the aminoglycoside tobramycin was performed in laboratory animals. High doses of <b>cefamandole</b> nafate did not increase the acute toxicity (lethality) of tobramycin in rats or mice. In a subacute experiment in rats, dose-related tobramycin nephrotoxicity, as evidenced by blood urea nitrogen changes, increased kidney weights, and histologically determined tubular nephrosis and necrosis, was observed. Concomitant treatment with <b>cefamandole</b> nafate, 500 mg/kg, did not increase tobramycin nephrotoxicity, but protected against the aminoglycoside-induced renal injury. Determination of tissue radioactivity after administration of [14 C]tobramycin indicated that <b>cefamandole</b> nafate treatment resulted in uniformly lower tobramycin tissue concentrations compared with the control, suggesting that the protective effect was produced by enhanced excretion of tobramycin after <b>cefamandole</b> nafate treatment...|$|E
