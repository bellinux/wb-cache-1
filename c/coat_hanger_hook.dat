40|$|Dr Jüri Kermik {{from the}} Design and Craft Programme, Faculty of Arts, was invited guest {{exhibitor}} at the EcoDesign 2011 exhibition in Finland (14 - 18 September). EcoDesign is a prestigious annual event launched in 2009 and held {{as part of}} the Helsinki Design Week. The theme of the 3 rd International EcoDesign was MultiFunction. The exhibition presented ecological and multifunctional furniture from 100 internationally recognized designers from 11 countries including Shigeru Ban, Karim Rashid, Eero Aarnio and Björn Dahlström. Kermik’s design STANDPOINT minimises the amount of material and parts but extends the degree of multifunctionality through detailing, modularity and options for assembly. STANDPOINT utilises only four inter-connectable components for a maximum adjustability. Rather than attempting to define a fixed proposition, Kermik invites the user to create an object to be acted upon. Component parts: four wooden interconnectable and adjustable arms/legs, tray(s) and a box. Compatibles: lampshades, <b>coat</b> <b>hangers,</b> <b>hooks,</b> umbrellas, tools, instruments, clothes, books, maps, flowers, candles etc. Combinations: tripod, easel, stick-leg stand, pedestal, lampstand, crutch, sewing stand, display cabinet, telescope mount, workstand, trestle, plant stand, display stand, deadman, drinks cabinet, cake stand, leg, standard lamp, prop, sawhorse, <b>coat</b> <b>hanger,</b> clothes rack, buttress, music stand, bracket, stick measure, straight edge, mirror stand, notice board, tool box, tool rack, book case, adjustable square, compass, stilt, sign support, gun mount, bookstand, tray stand, magazine rack, key cabinet, valet stand, umbrella stand, candlestand, trivet, navigator’s level...|$|R

The album cover, tour edition releases, and related press materials feature cartoon graphics of a boy wearing a rain parka, and holding a wire <b>coat</b> <b>hanger</b> by its <b>hook.</b> [...] Inside the liner notes for the deluxe edition of the album, there is a photograph {{of each of the}} band members posed in a similar manner, and standing near a telephone box.|$|R
40|$|A coin is {{balanced}} on the flat end of a bent <b>coat</b> <b>hanger.</b> With practice, the <b>coat</b> <b>hanger</b> can be rotated in a complete circle without displacing the coin, as shown in Figure 1, which is taken from the video. This is demonstrated in real time and in slow motion. This demonstration makes use of the contact force between the coin {{and the end of}} the <b>coat</b> <b>hanger</b> to hold the coin in place. The centripetal force exerted by the <b>coat</b> <b>hanger</b> on the coin and the resultant centrifugal reaction exerted on the <b>coat</b> <b>hanger</b> by the coin provide the contact force...|$|R
40|$|A weightless wire <b>coat</b> <b>hanger</b> bent {{out of its}} {{plane is}} one of the {{simplest}} possible structures. All it does is transfer a force and moment around a closed space curve. Assembling a family of <b>coat</b> <b>hangers</b> enables us to build up trusses and frames and if we allow an infinite number of <b>coat</b> <b>hangers</b> which overlap we can assemble plates, shells and fully three dimensional structures. We can apply loads to these structures via a loading frame and wires, also made from <b>coat</b> <b>hangers.</b> A wire carrying an electric current produces a magnetic field in the space surrounding the wire. For the bent <b>coat</b> <b>hanger</b> we can imagine that there is a vector field surrounding the wire {{as a result of the}} force and moment in the wire. We can use this vector field to obtain expressions for the forces and moments in a shell in equilibrium with applied loads...|$|R

2500|$|SMU and Texas A {{both were}} in the Southwest Conference (1915-1996). A group of cadet in Corp decided {{that the best way}} to prepare for the SMU game was to {{fabricate}} spurs hand-made from <b>coat</b> <b>hangers,</b> with rowels made from flattened bottle caps. [...] "Spur them Ponies" [...] was the battle cry. The Sunday prior to the A game saw hundreds of fish out in the quad, pounding bottle caps, punching holes in their centers, and bending <b>coat</b> <b>hangers.</b> The <b>coat</b> <b>hangers</b> had to be bent just so, to keep the spurs attached to the shoes, without doing permanent damage to the required spit-shine. The SMU-A rivalry isn't very strong anymore. However, Freshman in the Corp of Cadets still to this day walk around campus the week before the SMU game with these [...] "Fish Spurs".|$|R
40|$|In polymer processing, the {{material}} flow often passes from an extruder {{to the next}} pro-cessing stage through a die. In many processes, {{the object is to}} obtain a flow of uniform shear deformation history, uniform averaged residence time, and uniform averaged exit velocity coming out of the die. The geometry of dies that meet these demands can be derived analytically for Power Law fluids in an isothermal flow; they turn out to be shaped like <b>coat</b> <b>hangers.</b> The theoretical analysis of <b>coat</b> <b>hanger</b> dies is two-dimensional, implying that the in-fluences of side walls and of a sudden decrease in channel height is neglected. These assumptions are tested by performing both two-dimen,sional and three-dimensional com-putations on a test problem. They prove to be correct. The isothermal flow of material in two types of <b>coat</b> <b>hanger</b> dies is simulated numer-ically with the VIp program. The results of these simulations match quite well with the theoretical analyis, although some improvements might be made. Using the VIp program gives the opportunity to analyse more complex fluids, non-isothermal flows, and multi component flows, and to perform particle tracking on these flows. It is also possible to simulate the filling of a mould with a <b>coat</b> <b>hanger</b> die attached to it. Although <b>coat</b> <b>hanger</b> dies have originally been developed for sheet extrusion, the as-pect of uniform residence time can make them also useful for applications in reaction injection moulding processes. There they can provide uniformity of degree of conversion of {{the material}} flow entering the mould...|$|R

Lana tries to deny that Dr. Thredson raped her and Mary Eunice gives her a {{document}} confirming her pregnancy. Lana and Kit discuss {{what should be done}} with the hostage Thredson – she wants him dead; Kit needs him alive to prove Kit's innocence in the killings. They agree to get him to talk. She shows Thredson the pregnancy document and convinces him to confess. He relates the three killings to her and a hidden Kit plays back the recorded confession. Lana tells Thredson she has aborted the fetus with a <b>coat</b> <b>hanger</b> and Kit hides the tape in the hydrotherapy room. She later returns to kill Thredson with the <b>coat</b> <b>hanger</b> but he has been released and is missing. Mary Eunice stops her and sees the <b>coat</b> <b>hanger,</b> with which Lana admits to aborting the fetus. Mary Eunice assures her that the fetus still lives in Lana's womb.|$|R
