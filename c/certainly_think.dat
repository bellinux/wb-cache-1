500|$|The episode also {{features}} the final appearance of Harry Hamlin as Season 1 antagonist Aaron Echolls after {{the character is}} murdered by Clarence Wiedman (Christopher B. Duncan). Later, we learn that the murder was ordered by Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn), who appears briefly in a small cameo. Dunn had made his final regular appearance in [...] "Donut Run" [...] and had left the show partly due to fan dislike of the character. Dunn later stated {{that he thought that}} the purpose of the cameo was to garner sympathy for the character before his final departure. [...] "I think Rob's goal was to leave the character on a high note. I <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> he did so in a heroic way." ...|$|E

[...] "And sometimes I think it's amusing and flattering and well-done. When I heard [...] on {{the radio}} ... I said, 'that sounds very familiar." [...] Gaga herself addressed the comparisons on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, explaining that she had received an e-mail from Madonna's representatives, who had mentioned their support for [...] "Born This Way". CNN later reported that Madonna's representatives were not aware that the singer, or her team, had sent Gaga an e-mail regarding the situation. AllMusic also note a [...] "striking similarity" [...] between [...] "Express Yourself" [...] and Kylie Minogue's 1991 single [...] "What Do I Have to Do", writing that [...] "Kylie Minogue has always displayed a strong Madonna influence—something she’s readily admitted to in interviews." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1975, after George Moscone {{had been}} elected Mayor, he {{appointed}} Charles Gain as his Chief of Police. Gain, whose conciliatory position towards African Americans had branded {{him as one of}} the most liberal law enforcement officers in the country, soon earned the ire of the police force. Gain implemented policies that proved unpopular with his staff, such as painting police cars powder blue, and barring officers from drinking on the job. His lenient policies towards gays also angered the police force. When asked what he would do if a gay police officer came out, Gain replied [...] "I <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> that a gay policeman could be up front about it under me. If I had a gay policeman who came out, I would support him 100 percent." [...] This statement sent shockwaves through the police department, and made national headlines. Made during the first week of Gain's tenure, the remark also made Mayor Moscone extremely unpopular with the police. The two were so intensely disliked by the police that in 1977 rumors circulated about a plan by right-wing police officers to assassinate Gain, and a year later similar plans formed targeting Mayor Moscone. Upon being informed of this threat, Moscone hired a bodyguard.|$|E

"I <b>certainly</b> did <b>think,</b> Mr. Philip," [...] {{said the}} gentleman alluded to, a very young-looking, apple-faced little man, with a timid manner, {{who stood in}} the {{background}} nervously rubbing his dry hands together--"I <b>certainly</b> did <b>think</b> that the squire looked aged when I saw him this morning." ...|$|R
40|$|Is there a {{quick and}} simple {{technology}} fix for global warming? Canadian environmental scientist David Keith <b>certainly</b> <b>thinks</b> so. He says the science of what’s called geo-engineering (or climate engineering) is already advanced enough to allow humans to combat the impending catastrophes of the future. But others {{see it as a}} recipe for increased climate chaos. All agree, however, {{that when it comes to}} geo-engineering, it’s essentially a matter of when, not if...|$|R

2500|$|During the 1999 NATO {{bombing of}} Yugoslavia, Friedman wrote the {{following}} in The New York Times on April 23, 1999: [...] "Like it or not, {{we are at}} war with the Serbian nation (the Serbs <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> so), and the stakes have to be very clear: Every week you ravage Kosovo is another decade we will set your country back by pulverizing you. You want 1950? We can do 1950. You want 1389? We can do 1389 too." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{meeting with}} Austro-Hungarian Ambassador to Germany Szögyény on 5 July, the German Emperor {{informed}} him that his state could [...] "count on Germany's full support", even if [...] "grave European complications" [...] ensued, and that Austria-Hungary [...] "ought to march at once" [...] against Serbia. He added that [...] "in any case, as things stood today, Russia {{was not at all}} ready for war, and would <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> long before appealing to arms". Even if Russia were to act in defence of Serbia, Wilhelm promised that Germany would do everything in its power, including war, to support Austria-Hungary.|$|E
2500|$|The high {{academic}} standing of the University of Virginia {{in a national}} publication has added to the competitiveness between the two. In 2003, University of Maryland president C.D. Mote asserted that, in academic terms, Virginia was [...] "highly overrated these days ... U.S. News & World Report places them {{at the top of}} the pile with Berkeley, which is ridiculous." [...] Mote further stated that students from the state of Maryland paying a higher tuition cost to attend the University of Virginia [...] "don’t know any better." [...] While the University of Virginia president, John Casteen, said such remarks can be taken out of context, Virginia board of visitors member, William H. Goodwin, responded in The Cavalier Daily, [...] "I <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> a college president should have more class, but you have to expect that from Maryland." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regardless, {{the claims}} by Cruikshank and Ainsworth's {{refutation}} only brought Cruikshank disfavour with the public. To society, as Ellis puts it, [...] "the only possible {{explanation of the}} artist's extraordinary assertions {{is that he was}} a victim of senile delusions". Cruikshank's friend, William Powell Frith, believed that Cruikshank was under an [...] "absurd delusion" [...] in the matter. Another friend, Austin Dobsin, stated, [...] "I <b>certainly</b> <b>think</b> Cruikshank was honestly deluded, but he was, no doubt a vain man" [...] and [...] "He was not exempt from a certain 'Roman infirmity' of exaggerating the importance of his own performances [...] It must also be conceded that he most signally seconded the text by his graphic interpretations; but that this aid or these suggestions were of such a nature as to transfer the credit [...] from authors to himself is more than can be reasonably allowed." ...|$|E
