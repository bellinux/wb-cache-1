40|$|We {{present a}} method to {{automatically}} detect dust and scratches on photographic material, in particular silver halide film, where traditional methods for detecting and removing defects fail. The film is digitized using a novel setup involving cross-polarization and dark-field illumination in a <b>cardinal</b> <b>light</b> configuration, which compresses the signal and highlights the parts that are due to defects in the film. Applying a princi-pal component analysis (PCA) on the four cardinal images allows us to further separate the signal part of the film from the defects. Information from all four principal components is combined to produce a surface defect mask, {{which can be used}} as input to inpainting methods to remove the defects. Our method is able to detect most of the dust and scratches while keeping false-detections low...|$|E
40|$|MTh (Missiology), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The debate amongst Christian apologists {{regarding}} which apologetical {{method is}} most useful, continues, and church history not only testifies to this fact, but also displays {{the variety of}} ways in which apologetics has been approached by theologians of old (Craig, et all., 2000 : 7). Closer analyses of the Presuppositional method of Apologetics sheds <b>cardinal</b> <b>light</b> on this debate, and offers possible conclusions and recommendations regarding the way forward for Apologetics (Bahnsen, 1998 : 467). The nature, effectiveness and reliability of Presuppositionalism become evident through careful analyses of the Bahnsenian method. The views of two South-African opponents of Christianity are apologetically evaluated with the Bahnsenian method. So doing, the Presuppositional method as interpreted by Bahnsen is not only proven effective, but also indispensable to the defence of orthodox Christianity also in South Africa. Master...|$|E

Its theoretical framework should be made from three perspectives of the regional definition, the functional objectives and <b>cardinal</b> content. In <b>light</b> of the reality in the current China, it is comparatively more reasonable to deeply promote the regional rule of law by continuing the mode of government-promotion road. Of course the conflicts between {{the unity of the}} rule of law and regional autonomy, regional rule of law and the unified market construction, official law and unofficial law will appear and needs coordinating. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{fifteenth century}} was a {{critical}} juncture for the College of Cardinals. They were accused of prolonging the exile in Avignon and causing the schism. At the councils {{at the beginning of}} the period their very existence was questioned. They rebuilt their relationship with the popes by playing a fundamental part in reclaiming Rome when the papacy returned to its city in 1420. Because their careers were usually much longer than that of an individual pope, the cardinals combined to form a much more effective force for restoring Rome. In this book, shifting focus from the popes to the <b>cardinals</b> sheds new <b>light</b> on a relatively unknown period for Renaissance art history and the history of Rome...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Ability to {{acclimate}} photo-chemical processes by saplings of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) growing in contrasting light environments was investigated using chlorophyll a fluores-cence. The leaves of saplings acclimated to irra-diance under the open canopy of Larix decidua Mill. showed higher photosynthetic efficiency {{and more efficient}} photoprotective mechanism than those {{under the shade of}} the denser Picea abies Karst. canopy. Interspecific differences in quantum yield of PS II photochemistry, appar-ent electron transport rate, non-photochemical quenching and the values of the <b>cardinal</b> points of <b>light</b> response curves of these parameters resulted from the shade adaptation of leaves and leaf life-span. Acclimation to shade did not increase sen-sitivity to strong PS II downregulation induced by light patch of low intensity but predisposed both species to photoinhibition caused by high light stress. They were able to efficiently use light patches of low intensity, but after high light stress beech leaves from the Larix stand recovered more dynamically in quantum yield of PS II photo-chemistry than silver fir. It may give an advantage to beech in between-species competition for use of short-lasting and intensive sun patches.

40|$|Light-induced {{degeneration}} in rodent retinas is {{an established}} model for of retinal degeneration, including {{the roles of}} oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory activity. In these models, photoreceptor death is elicited via photo-oxidative stress, and is exacerbated by recruitment of subretinal macrophages and activation of immune pathways including complement propagation. Existing light damage models have relied heavily on albino rodents, and mostly using acute light stimuli. These albino models have proven valuable in uncovering the pathogenic mechanisms of such pathways {{in the context of}} retinal disease. However, their inherent albinism hinders comparability to normal retinal physiology, and also makes gene technology analysis time-consuming due to the predominance of the pigmented mouse strains in these applications. In this study, we characterise a new light damage model utilising C 57 BL/ 6 J mice over a 7 day period of chronic light exposure. We use high-efficiency LED technology to deliver a sustained intensity of 100 k lux with negligible modulation of ambient temperature. We show that in the C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse, chronic light exposure elicits the <b>cardinal</b> features of <b>light</b> damage including photoreceptor degeneration, atrophy of the choriocapillaris, decreased retinal function and increases in oxidative stress markers 4 -HNE and 8 -OHG, which emerge progressively over the 7 day period of exposure. These changes are accompanied by robust recruitment of IBA 1 + and F 4 / 80 + microglia/macrophages to the ONL and subretinal space, followed the strong up-regulation of monocyte-chemoattractants Ccl 2, Ccl 3, and Ccl 12, as well as increases in expression of complement component C 3. These findings are in agreement with prior damage models conducted in albino rodents such as Balb/c mice, and support the use of this new model in further investigating the causative features of oxidative stress and inflammation in retinal disease...|$|R
