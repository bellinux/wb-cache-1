Other accessory genes include vif (viral infectivity factor), tat (transcription activator), and rev (protein expression regulator). In primate lentiviruses there is usually an ORF for nef (negative factor); this is not present in BIV. BIV has a structure like all retroviruses, and contains two copies of its positive sense single stranded RNA genome. It has two compartments: the envelope and the core. The envelope comes from the host cell plasma membrane, the virus takes the membrane as it buds and then inserts viral glycoproteins into its envelope.

The carrier state does not require the activity of all the genes necessary for phage production. It is possible to generate carrier states by infecting cells with virus or by electroporating nonreplicating plasmids containing cDNA copies of the viral genomes into the host cells. We have found that carrier states in both Φ 6 and Φ 8 can be formed at high frequency with all three genomic segments or with only the large and small segments.

40|$|Chronic {{infection}} with the hepatitis C virus frequently induces steatosis, {{which is a}} significant risk factor for liver pathogenesis. Steatosis {{is characterized by the}} accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes. The structural protein <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> induces lipid droplet formation and localizes {{on the surface of the}} lipid droplets. However, the precise molecular mechanisms for the core-induced formation of lipid droplets remain elusive. Recently, we showed that the expression of the core protein in yeast as a model system could induce lipid droplet formation. In this study, we probed the cellular factors responsible for the formation of core-induced lipid-droplets in yeast cells. We demonstrated that one of the enzymes responsible for triglyceride synthesis, a phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (Lro 1), is required for the core-induced lipid droplet formation. While core proteins inhibit Lro 1 degradation and alter Lro 1 localization, the characteristic localization of Lro 1 adjacent to the lipid droplets appeared to be responsible for the core-induced lipid droplet formation. RNA virus genomes have evolved using high mutation rates to maintain their ability to replicate. Our observations suggest a functional relationship between the core protein with hepatocytes and yeast cells.

25|$|Like {{protease}} inhibitors, bevirimat {{and other}} maturation inhibitors interfere with protease processing of newly translated HIV polyprotein precursor, called gag.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of people are susceptible to HIV infection. However, in the 1990 s, several individuals noticed that despite repeated exposure to the HIV virus they remained HIV negative. This could be {{due to the fact that}} these individuals were extremely lucky, or perhaps there was something different about them that made HIV infection less likely. William Paxton and his colleagues at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York became interested in this phenomenon of HIV protection. In this case study, you will retrace the steps and experiments that these researchers performed to understand the mechanism underlying the protection against HIV (Paxton et al., 1996). To this end, you must first review a few facts about the HIV virus, the immune system, and HIV infection. The HIV Virus The virus particle is spherical in shape. Its structure consists of multiple enclosed layers, like the skin of an onion. It is considerably smaller than human cells. At the center of a virus particle are two copies of its genetic material. HIV encodes its 9 genes using the nucleic acid molecule RNA (by comparison, our cells use DNA for this capacity). At the <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> particle are also proteins important for the replication of the virus (reverse transcriptase, integrase, protease, ribonuclease). The RNAs and proteins are wrapped in a protein coat (called the capsid) made of the protein p 24. The capsid in turn is wrapped in a double layer of phospholipids. Finally, there are proteins that stick out of the lipid layer, such as gp 120 (sometimes called Env).

Consistent with this model, we found that recombinant capsid proteins with as few as four matrix residues fused to their amino-termini formed spheres in vitro, but that removing these residues refolded the capsid amino-terminus and redirected protein assembly from spheres to cylinders. Moreover, point mutations throughout the putative CA-CA interface blocked capsid assembly in vitro, core assembly in vivo and viral infectivity.

M protein is a major structural protein that is known to play a critical role in virus assembly by binding the helical ribonucleoprotein <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> to the cytoplasmic surface of the cell plasma membrane during budding. In this study, two M protein mutants were tested to determine whether the inhibition of host transcription by M protein is an indirect effect of its function in virus assembly or whether it represents an independent function of M protein. The mutant M protein of the conditionally temperature-sensitive (ts) {{vesicular stomatitis}} virus mutant, tsO 82, was found to be defective in its ability to inhibit host-directed gene expression, as shown by its inability to inhibit expression of a cotransfected target gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The ability of the tsO 82 M protein to function in virus assembly was similar to that of wild-type M protein, as shown by its ability to complement the group III ts M protein mutant, tsO 23. Another mutant, MN 1, which lacks amino acids 4 to 21 of M protein demonstrated that the abilities of M protein to inhibit chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression and to localize to the nucleus were unaffected by deletion of this lysine-rich amino-terminal region but that the ability to function in virus assembly was ablated. Thus, the two M protein mutants examined in this study exhibited complementary phenotypes: tsO 82 M protein functioned in virus assembly but was defective in inhibition of host-directed gene expression, while MN 1 M protein functioned in inhibiting gene expression but was unable to function in virus assembly. These data demonstrate that the role of M protein in inhibition of host transcription can be separated genetically from its role in virus assembly...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Bluetongue virus (BTV), which {{belongs to}} the Reoviridae family and {{orbivirus}} genus, is a non-enveloped, icosahedral, double-stranded RNA virus. Several protein layers enclose its genome; upon cell entry the outer layer is stripped away leaving a core, the surface of which is composed of VP 7. The structure of the trimeric VP 7 molecule has previously been determined using X-ray crystallography. The articulated VP 7 subunit consists of two domains, one which is largely α-helical and the other, smaller domain, is a β barrel with jelly-roll topology. The relative orientations of these two domains vary in different crystal forms. The structure of VP 7 {{and the organization of}} 780 subunits of this molecule in the <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> is central to the assembly and function of BTV. Results: A 23 Å resolution map of the core, determined using electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) data, reveals that the 260 trimers of VP 7 are organized on a rather precise T = 13 laevo icosahedral lattice, in accordance with the theory of quasi-equivalence. The VP 7 layer occupies a shell that is between 260 Åand 345 Å from the centre of the core. Below this radius (230 – 260 Å) lies the T= 1 layer of 120 molecules of VP 3. By fitting the X-ray structure of an individual VP 7 trimer onto the cryoEM BTV core structure, we have generated an atomic model of the VP 7 layer of BTV. This demonstrates that one of the molecular structures seen in crystals of the isolated VP 7 corresponds to the in vivo conformation of the molecule in the core. Conclusions: The β-barrel domains of VP 7 are external to the core and interact with the protein in the outer layer of the mature virion. The lower, α-helical domains of VP 7 interact with VP 3 molecules which form the inner layer of the BTV core. Adjacent VP 7 trimer–trimer interactions in the T= 13 layer are mediated principally through well-defined regions in the broader lower domains, to form a structure that conforms well with that expected from the theory of quasi-equivalence with no significant conformational changes within the individual trimers. The VP 3 layer determines the particle size and forms a rather smooth surface upon which the two-dimensional lattice of VP 7 trimers is laid down...|$|E

40|$|Coronaviruses possess {{three major}} {{size classes of}} polypeptides as judged by {{molecular}} weight: approximately 180, 000, approximately 50, 000, and approximately 23, 000. Human coronaviruses 229 E and OC 43 possess not only three similar size classes of polypeptides but also three distinct antigens, none of which cross-react with the heterologous strain. Polypeptides separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were reacted in rocket immunoelectrophoresis with antiserum monospecific to each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three strain-specific antigens (excised precipitin lines from crossed immunoelectrophoresis profiles were used for immunogens). Monospecific antiserum with neutralizing ability reacted with a polypeptide of 186, 000 daltons for 229 E and a polypeptide of 190, 000 daltons for OC 43. The antigen which elicited neutralizing antibody response was located at the surface, associated with <b>the</b> corona <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virion, glycosylated, and bound by concanavalin A. Another less prominent surface antigen was represented by size classes of 23, 000 daltons for 229 E and 24, 000 for OC 43. <b>The</b> <b>core</b> antigens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> had molecular weights of 49, 000 and 229 E and 52, 000 and OC 43 <b>virus.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> molecular weights and functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antigens <b>of</b> human coronaviruses {{are similar to those}} <b>of</b> animal coronaviruses. <b>The</b> polypeptides <b>of</b> coronaviruses 229 E and OC 43 are nearly identical as judged by molecular weight, but <b>the</b> similar polypeptides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>viruses</b> represent different immunological specificities...|$|R
40|$|Ribonuclease H (RNA·DNA-hybrid ribonucleotidohydrolase, EC 3. 1. 4. 34) {{has been}} {{reported}} to copurify with reverse transcriptase (RNA directed DNA polymerase) of RNA tumor viruses. In addition, viral specific ribonuclease H and reverse transcriptase of avian type-C viruses are thought to be part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same polypeptide. In this report we show that a fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ribonuclease H activity from Rauscher murine leukemia and Kirsten murine sarcoma viruses was separated from reverse transcriptase by anion exchange chromatography while the remaining portion co-purified with the viral polymerase. <b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> this co-purified nuclease activity was about 4 - to 8 -fold lower than the activity found in avian myeloblastosis virus (with respect to <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> ribonuclease H to reverse transcriptase) and this nuclease activity can only be detected by using labeled substrate of high specific radioactivity. However, a complete separation of ribonuclease H activity from reverse transcriptase was obtained by purifying <b>core</b> structures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. While reverse transcriptase was present in the cores, there was no detectable ribonuclease H. Furthermore, a specific antibody against Rauscher leukemia virus reverse transcriptase did not inhibit any virion associated ribonuclease H activity. Our results suggest that in these virions these two enzyme activities reside in two separate molecules and probably in two different compartments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus.</b> These findings emphasize a basic difference between the avian and murine type-C virus DNA polymerases...|$|R

Since this triplet occurs frequently in DNA regulatory regions, it was proposed that these sequences {{may be part of}} a structural element for specific protein interaction. We examine here three additional biologically significant 17 base pair duplexes containing GTG/CAC triplets: (1) a sequence from the mouse heavy chain immunoglobulin enhancer, (2) a sequence from <b>the</b> critical <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Simian <b>Virus</b> 40 (SV 40) enhancer, and (3) a sequence from pBR 322 plasmid used as control for experiments with the SV 40 DNA sequences.

40|$|SUMMARY <b>The</b> {{classification}} <b>of</b> {{chronic hepatitis}} introduced in 1968 is still current, {{but has been}} modified. <b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> bridging hepatic necrosis has been incorporated, and is recognised as an important feature of both acute and chronic aggressive (active) hepatitis (CAH). In <b>the</b> pathogenesis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter, piecemeal necrosis is, however, {{thought to be the}} more important factor. <b>The</b> histo-logical picture <b>of</b> CAH varies widely. Several causes of CAH have been identified, including hep-atitis B virus. Recognition <b>of</b> surface and <b>core</b> components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> in tissue sections has facil-itated study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship between host response and pathological lesion in chronic hepatitis. CAH and primary biliary cirrhosis share histological features, and a mixed form has been postulated. Staining for copper sometimes helps to distinguish the two lesions. A third histological category, chronic lobular hepatitis, comprises patients with histological lesions like those of acute hepatitis, but with a chronic or recurrent course. Ten years ago De Groote et al. (1968) emphasised the need to subdivide chronic hepatitis, according to histological criteria, into categories with differing prognosis. The more benign form, chronic per-sistent hepatitis (CPH), was characterised by in-flammation largely confined to portal tracts, with or without superimposed features of acute hepatitis in the lobules. The essentially benign nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lesion has since been confirmed (Becker et al., 1970; Chadwick et al., 1977), although progression to more serious liver disease is recorded (Vido et al. ...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported that immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH) support <b>the</b> generation <b>of</b> infectious hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 a (clone H 77).

Taken together, our results suggested that HCV genotype 1 a (clone H 77) can be serially passaged in IHH and that HCV infection induces an autophagic response in hepatocytes...|$|R
40|$|Virions {{are thought}} to contain all the {{essential}} proteins that govern <b>virus</b> egress from <b>the</b> host cell and initiation <b>of</b> replication in <b>the</b> target cell. It {{has been known for}} some time that influenza virions contain nine viral proteins; however, analyses of other enveloped viruses have revealed that proteins from the host cell can also be detected in virions. To address whether {{the same is true for}} influenza virus, we used two complementary mass spectrometry approaches to perform a comprehensive proteomic analysis of purified influenza virus particles. In addition to the aforementioned nine virus-encoded proteins, we detected <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> 36 host-encoded proteins. These include both cytoplasmic and membrane-bound proteins that can be grouped into several functional categories, such as cytoskeletal proteins, annexins, glycolytic enzymes, and tetraspanins. Interestingly, a significant number of these have also been reported to be present in virions of other virus families. Protease treatment of virions combined with immunoblot analysis was used to verify <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cellular protein and also to determine whether it is located in <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> influenza <b>virus</b> particle. Immunogold labeling confirmed <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> membrane-bound host proteins on <b>the</b> influenza <b>virus</b> envelope. <b>The</b> identification <b>of</b> cellular constituents of influenza virions has important implications for understanding <b>the</b> interactions <b>of</b> influenza <b>virus</b> with its host and brings us a step closer to defining the cellular requirements for influenza virus replication.

40|$|Replication of {{papovavirus}} DNA {{requires a}} functional replication origin, a virus-encoded protein, large T antigen, and species-specific permissive factors. How these components interact to initiate and sustain viral DNA replication is not known. Toward that end, we {{have attempted to}} identify <b>the</b> viral target(s) <b>of</b> permissive factors. <b>The</b> functionally defined replication origins of polyomavirus and simian virus 40, two papovaviruses that replicate in different species (mice and monkeys, respectively), are composed of two functionally distinct domains: a core domain and an auxiliary domain. <b>The</b> origin <b>cores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>viruses</b> are remarkably similar in primary structure and have common binding sites for large T antigen. By contrast, their auxiliary domains share few sequences and serve as binding sites for cellular proteins. It seemed plausible, therefore, that if cellular permissive factors interacted with the replication origin, their targets {{were likely to be}} in the auxiliary domain. To test this hypothesis we constructed hybrid origins for DNA replication that were composed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auxiliary domain <b>of</b> one <b>virus</b> and <b>the</b> origin <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other and assessed their capacity to replicate in a number of mouse and monkey cell lines, which express the large T antigen <b>of</b> one or <b>the</b> other <b>virus.</b> <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> this analysis showed that <b>the</b> auxiliary domains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viral replication origins could substitute for one another in DNA replication, provided that the viral origin core and its cognate large T antigen were present in a permissive cellular milieu. Surprisingly, the large T antigens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>viruses</b> could not substitute for one another, regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species <b>of</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> host cell, even though the two large T antigens bind to the same sequence motif in vitro. These results suggest that species-specific permissive factors do not interact with the origin-auxiliary domains but, rather, with either the origin core or the large T antigen or with both components to effect DNA replication...|$|R
