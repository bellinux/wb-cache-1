When fuel prices increase suddenly, for instance, consumers may still fill up their empty tanks in the short run, but when prices remain high over several years, more consumers will reduce their demand for fuel by switching to carpooling or public transportation, investing in vehicles with greater fuel economy or taking other measures. This does not hold for <b>consumer</b> <b>durables</b> such as the cars themselves, however; eventually, it may become necessary for consumers to replace their present cars, so one would expect demand to be less elastic.|$|E

This, has led to an increasing amount of awareness programmes being organised by corporate sectors as part of Corporate Social Responsibility. Now the companies are moving towards development of green (eco-friendly) products and services. Green products are produced to satisfy the needs and wants of consumers with minimum detrimental impact on the environment. It is commonly believed that consumer purchase and consumption behaviour is increasing for durable products in the global scenario. The motive behind purchase of green products by consumers is not well studied. Hence, the current study under consideration attempts to identify the factors influencing purchasing behaviour of <b>consumers</b> towards green <b>durables.</b> Green products are new and innovative; the purchase of the same by the consumer is linked with various factors like product, price, availability, promotion, personal factors, risk involved, usage pattern, financial assistance for green purchases, government support, persuading capacity of dealers, features of the product and so on. The study revealed that personal factor; promotion and product play an important role in purchase of green durables. Gender wise, no differential responses were obtained for purchase of green durables on various factors. Occupation wise comparison revealed that the employees from private sectors were willing to pay a high price for green durables, followed by unemployed, entrepreneurs and government servants the least.

The number of jobs being created is remarkably high and yet, unemployment will continue to rise. From the previous forecast last March growth of real GDP is revised upwards by 1 percentage point each – to 4 ½ percent for 1990 and 4 percent for 1991. The revision starts from a higher base as activity proved surprisingly buoyant {{in the first quarter of}} 1990 moving to a year-to-year increase by more than 5 percent. A new and self-sustained upswing has come under way, in which manufacturing industry plays a key role. Output will rise by about 8 percent this year and firms envisage an increase of their investment expenditure by no less than 30 percent. The optimism of entrepreneurs is matched by that of <b>consumers.</b> Purchases of <b>durables</b> went up by 15 percent in the first quarter and total consumption will rise by 4 ¼ percent in 1990, the highest rate in seven years. Despite the rebound in domestic demand the current account will improve by some AS 5 billion both this year and next, yielding a surplus in the order of AS 10 billion in 1991.

40|$|We {{build on}} the Maddison GDP data to {{assemble}} international time series from before 1914 on real per capita personal consumer expenditure, C. We also improve the GDP data in many cases. The C variable comes closer than GDP to the consumption concept that enters into usual asset-pricing equations. (A separation of <b>consumer</b> expenditure into <b>durables</b> and non-durables is feasible for {{only a minority of}} cases.) We have essentially full annual data on C for 22 countries and GDP for 35 countries, and we plan to complete the long-term time series for a few more countries. For samples that start as early as 1870, we apply a peak-to-trough method for each country to isolate economic crises, defined as cumulative declines in C or GDP by at least 10 %. The principal world economic crises ranked by importance are World War II, World War I and the Great Depression, the early 1920 s (possibly reflecting the influenza epidemic of 1918 - 20), and post-World War II events such as the Latin American debt crisis and the Asian financial crisis. We find 87 crises for C and 148 for GDP, implying disaster probabilities around 3. 6 % per year. The disaster size has a mean of 21 - 22 % and an average duration of 3. 5 years. A comparison of C and GDP declines shows roughly coincident timing. The average fractional decline in C exceeds that in GDP during wartime crises but is similar for non-war crises. We simulate a Lucas-tree model with i. i. d. growth shocks and Epstein-Zin-Weil preferences. This simulation accords with the observed average equity premium of around 7 % on levered equity, using a "reasonable" coefficient of relative risk aversion of 3. 5. This result is robust to a number of perturbations, except for limiting the sample to non-war crises, a selection that eliminates most of the largest declines in C and GDP. We plan a statistical analysis that uses all the time-series data and includes estimation of long-run effects of crises on levels and growth rates of C and GDP. We will also study the bond-bill premium (empirically around 1 %) and allow for time-varying disaster probabilities. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{the volume}} of the {{remittance}} inflow has increased remarkably in developing countries, it has attracted the interest of international organisations, academics, and policy makers. In this context, this study analyses the determinants of the receipt of remittances and its impact of on household expenditure and child welfare in Nepal using Nepal living standard survey (NLSSIII) data. It takes the receipt of remittances by households as the cause and their proportional expenditure on different bundles of goods, services (food, housing, <b>consumer</b> goods and <b>durables,</b> education, health and others) and child welfare as an outcome. This study divides the Nepalese households into two groups: one that does not receive any remittances is the control group, and the other receiving remittances from within the country or abroad is the treated group. To estimate the impact of remittances, the treatment effect model calculates potential outcome means (POMs) in the population. The difference between the two means is the average effect of the remittance. The study finds that the variables rural/urban region, ecological zone, family size, gender and education of head, the number of children, poverty of households, and migration network {{have a significant effect on}} the receipt of remittances. Although the probability of the receiving remittance is higher in rural households, they have received significantly less amount of remittances than the urban households. This study finds that households’ expenditure behaviour on food, consumer goods, health, and other bundles has not changed by the receipt of remittances in Nepal. However, there is an increase in the budget share of education and a decrease in the housing expenditure. It is highly likely that malnutrition in Nepalese children increases with the increase in their age. The research findings reveal that the receipt of remittances is helpful in reducing child malnutrition. The receipt of remittances does not increase the educational expenditure of school going children, and there is no difference in educational expenses between boys and girls. Finally, the study does not find any evidence to support that receipt of remittances increases conspicuous consumption of households as proposed by the findings of Chami et al. (2003). Instead, the research findings support the view that Nepalese households invest more in the education with the receipt of remittances. This higher investment may have been caused by the altruism towards the family members or by a knowledge gain...|$|R
