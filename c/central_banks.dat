5|$|Monetarism {{attracted}} the attention of policy makers in the late-1970s and 1980s. Friedman and Phelps's version of the Phillips curve performed better during stagflation and gave monetarism a boost in credibility. By the mid-1970s monetarism had become the new orthodoxy in macroeconomics, and by the late-1970s <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> in the United Kingdom and United States had largely adopted a monetarist policy of targeting money supply instead of interest rates when setting policy. However, targeting monetary aggregates proved difficult for <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> because of measurement difficulties. Monetarism faced a major test when Paul Volcker took over the Federal Reserve Chairmanship in 1979. Volcker tightened the money supply and brought inflation down, creating a severe recession in the process. The recession lessened monetarism's popularity but clearly demonstrated the importance of money supply in the economy. Monetarism became less credible when once-stable money velocity defied monetarist predictions and began to move erratically in the United States during the early 1980s. Monetarist methods of single-equation models and non-statistical analysis of plotted data also lost out to the simultaneous-equation modeling favored by Keynesians. Monetarism's policies and method of analysis lost influence among central bankers and academics, but its core tenets of the long-run neutrality of money (increases in money supply cannot have long-term effects on real variables, such as output) and use of monetary policy for stabilization became a part of the macroeconomic mainstream even among Keynesians.|$|E

5|$|A state {{wishing to}} devalue, {{or at least}} check the {{appreciation}} of its currency, must work within {{the constraints of the}} prevailing International monetary system. During the 1930s, countries had relatively more direct control over their exchange rates through the actions of their <b>central</b> <b>banks.</b> Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, markets substantially increased in influence, with market forces largely setting the exchange rates for an increasing number of countries. However, a state's central bank can still intervene in the markets to effect a devaluation – if it sells its own currency to buy other currencies then this will cause the value of its own currency to fall – a practice common with states that have a managed exchange rate regime. Less directly, quantitative easing (common in 2009 and 2010), tends to lead to a fall {{in the value of the}} currency even if the central bank does not directly buy any foreign assets.|$|E
5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by <b>central</b> <b>banks),</b> and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
40|$|The {{endogenous}} {{theory of}} money, developed by Basil Moore, {{argues that the}} supply of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> money in modern economies is not {{under the control of}} the <b>central</b> <b>bank.</b> According to this view, a <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> typically supplies cash reserves automatically on demand at its minimum lending rate, resulting in a clearly horizontal money supply function. While the paper agrees with Moore that the supply of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> money cannot be determined exogenously by the <b>central</b> <b>bank,</b> it wonders whether the supply is determined completely by the demand of the commercial banks. The paper suggests that the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> has some exogenous power to control the quantity of its supply by rationing. More importantly, the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> is forced to do so! The <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> cannot not merely exist as an automat responding to the wishes of the commercial banks.

40|$|Together with institutional, {{functional}} and organizational independence, financial independence constitutes {{one of the}} cornerstones of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> independence, the economic ratio {{of which has been}} demonstrated extensively in the literature. In broad terms financial independence may be defined as referring to the legal and practical arrangements identifying the finances of a <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> {{and the extent to which}} the bank is subject to outside influence in this regard. In the (legal) debate on <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> accountability, arguably arrangements relating to <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> finances have sometimes been treated in a rather step motherly fashion. Yet, with the wider debate on good governance structures having reached <b>central</b> <b>banking,</b> more attention is paid to such detailed arrangements. This contribution focuses on and aims at providing an overview on the impact on <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> independence of the legal arrangements relating to several aspects of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> finances. While government access to <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> money undoubtedly has an impact on the financial position of the <b>central</b> <b>bank,</b> this contribution focuses on those elements, which are arguably more directly linked to the financial position of a <b>central</b> <b>bank,</b> including capitalization and recapitalization, the determination of the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> budget and the arrangements on profit and loss distribution. In legal studies these arrangements have certainly received less attention.

5|$|The global {{financial}} {{system is the}} worldwide framework of legal agreements, institutions, and both formal and informal economic actors that together facilitate international flows of financial capital for purposes of investment and trade financing. Since emerging in the late 19th century during the first modern wave of economic globalization, its evolution is marked by the establishment of <b>central</b> <b>banks,</b> multilateral treaties, and intergovernmental organizations aimed at improving the transparency, regulation, and effectiveness of international markets. In the late 1800s, world migration and communication technology facilitated unprecedented growth in international trade and investment. At the onset of World War I, trade contracted as foreign exchange markets became paralyzed by money market illiquidity. Countries sought to defend against external shocks with protectionist policies and trade virtually halted by 1933, worsening {{the effects of the}} global Great Depression until a series of reciprocal trade agreements slowly reduced tariffs worldwide.

40|$|When a <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> {{implements}} the LOLR {{policy in}} a financial crisis, bank creditors often infer a bank's quality from {{whether or not it}} borrows from the <b>central</b> <b>bank.</b> We establish a formal model to study the optimal LOLR policy in the presence of this signaling effect, assuming that the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> aims to encourage <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> borrowing to avoid inefficiencies caused by contagion. In our model, {{there are two types of}} banks: a high quality type with high expected asset returns and a low quality type with lower returns. Both types of banks need to roll over their short-term debts. A <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> offers to lend to both types of banks. After private creditors observe whether banks borrow from the <b>central</b> <b>bank,</b> banks try to borrow from the private market. We find that there may exist a separating equilibrium where only low quality banks borrow from the central bank; and two pooling equilibria where both types of banks do and do not borrow from the <b>central</b> <b>bank.</b> Our major results are as follows: (1) Considering the signaling effect, the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> should set its lending rate lower than the prevailing market rate to induce both types of banks to borrow from the <b>central</b> <b>bank.</b> (2) Hiding the identity of banks borrowing from the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> will encourage banks to borrow from the <b>central</b> <b>bank.</b> (3) The <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> may serve as a coordinator for the realization of its favored equilibrium...|$|R
