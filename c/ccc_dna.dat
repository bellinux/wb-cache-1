As {{a first step toward}} understanding how <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> is formed, we analyzed the viral and host factors that may be involved in <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> formation, using transient and stable DNA transfections of HBV and the related avian hepadnavirus, duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV). Our results show that HBV <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> formed in hepatoma cells was derived predominantly from RC DNA with a precise junction sequence. In contrast to that of DHBV, HBV <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> formation in cultured cells was accompanied by the accumulation of a RC DNA species from which the covalently attached viral reverse transcriptase (RT) protein was removed (protein-free or PF-RC DNA). Furthermore, whereas envelope deficiency led to increased <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> formation in DHBV, it resulted mainly in increased PF-RC, but not <b>CCC,</b> <b>DNA</b> in HBV, suggesting that the envelope protein(s) may negatively regulate a step in <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> formation that precedes deproteination in both HBV and DHBV. Interestingly, PF-RC DNA, in contrast to RT-linked RC DNA, contained, almost exclusively, mature plus-strand DNA, suggesting that the RT protein was removed preferentially from mature RC DNA...|$|E

Due to topological differences from conventional circular covalently closed (<b>CCC)</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> vectors, the linear topology of LCC DNA ministrings may present differences with regards to DNA interaction and the physicochemical properties influencing DNA-surfactant interactions in the formulation of lipoplexed particles. In this study, N,N-bis(dimethylhexadecyl) -α,ω-propanediammonium(16 - 3 - 16) gemini-based synthetic vectors, incorporating either CCC plasmid or LCC DNA ministrings, were characterized and compared with respect to particle size, zeta potential, DNA encapsulation, DNase sensitivity, and in vitro transgene delivery efficacy. Through comparative analysis, differences between <b>CCC</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> and LCC DNA ministrings led to variations in the physical properties of the resulting lipoplexes after complexation with 16 - 3 - 16 gemini surfactants. Despite the size disparities between the plasmid <b>DNA</b> vectors (<b>CCC)</b> and <b>DNA</b> ministrings (LCC), differences in DNA topology resulted in the generation of lipoplexes of comparable particle sizes.

Physical mapping of the 5 ' and 3 ' ends of RC DNA and sequence analysis of <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> revealed that <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> synthesis requires {{the removal of the}} RT and an RNA oligomer from the 5 ' ends of minus and plus strand DNA, respectively, removal of sequences from the terminally redundant minus strand, completion of the less than full-length plus strand, and ligation of the ends. Two models have been proposed that could explain <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> formation. The first (model 1) invokes a role for the RT to catalyze a cleavage-ligation reaction leading to the formation of a unit length minus strand in <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> and a DNA repair reaction for the completion and ligation of plus strand DNA; the second (model 2) predicts that <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> formation depends entirely on cellular DNA repair enzymes. To determine which mechanism is utilized, we developed cell lines expressing duck hepatitis B virus genomes carrying mutations permitting us to follow the fate of viral DNA sequences during their conversion from RC to <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA.</b> Our results demonstrated that the oligomer at the 5 ' end of minus strand DNA is completely or at least partially removed prior to <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> synthesis.

40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{replication}} {{and persistence}} are sustained by a nuclear episome, the covalently closed circular (<b>CCC)</b> <b>DNA,</b> {{which serves as}} the transcriptional template for all viral RNAs. <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> is converted from a relaxed circular (RC) DNA in the virion early during infection {{as well as from}} RC DNA in intracellular progeny nucleocapsids via an intracellular amplification pathway. Current antiviral therapies suppress viral replication but cannot eliminate <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA.</b> Thus, persistence of <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> remains an obstacle toward curing chronic HBV infection. Unfortunately, very little is known about how <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> is formed. <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> formation requires removal of the virally encoded reverse transcriptase (RT) protein from the 5 ' end of the minus strand of RC DNA. Tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase- 2 (Tdp 2) was recently identified as the enzyme responsible for cleavage of tyrosyl- 5 ' DNA linkages formed between topoisomerase II and cellular DNA. Because the RT-DNA linkage is also a 5 ' DNA-phosphotyrosyl bond, it has been hypothesized that Tdp 2 might be one of several elusive host factors required for <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> formation. Therefore, we examined the role of Tdp 2 in RC DNA deproteination and <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> formation. We demonstrated Tdp 2 can cleave the tyrosyl-minus strand DNA linkage using authentic HBV RC DNA isolated from nucleocapsids and using RT covalently linked to short minus strand DNA produced in vitro. On the other hand, our results showed that Tdp 2 gene knockout did not block <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> formation during HBV infection of permissive human hepatoma cells and did not prevent intracellular amplification of duck hepatitis B virus <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA.</b> These results indicate that although Tdp 2 can remove the RT covalently linked to the 5 ' end of the HBV minus strand DNA in vitro, this protein might not be required for <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> formation in vivo.

40|$|The {{elimination}} of viral covalently closed circular DNA (<b>CCC</b> <b>DNA)</b> from {{the nucleus of}} infected hepatocytes is an obstacle to achieving sustained viral clearance during antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

First, the effect of adefovir on viral <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> synthesis was examined with primary cultures of DHBV-infected fetal hepatocytes. Adefovir was administered for six consecutive days starting one day before or four days after DHBV inoculation. Dose-dependent inhibition of both virion release in culture supernatants and synthesis of intracellular viral DNA was observed. Although <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> amplification was inhibited by adefovir, <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> was not eliminated by antiviral treatment and the de novo formation of <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> was not prevented by pretreatment of the cells. Next, preventive treatment of experimentally infected ducklings with lamivudine or adefovir revealed that both efficiently suppressed viremia and intrahepatic DNA. However, persistence of viral DNA even when detectable only by PCR was associated with a recurrence of viral replication following drug withdrawal. Taken together, our results demonstrate that adefovir is a potent inhibitor of DHBV replication that inhibits <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> amplification but does not effectively prevent the formation of <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> from incoming viral genomes...|$|E
40|$|Physiocochemical {{evidence}} presented indicates plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) can associate with host chromosome without linear insertion {{of the former}} into the latter. This conclusion {{is based on the}} observation that covalently closed circular (<b>CCC)</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> can cosediment with undegraded host chromosome in a neutral sucrose gradient. When F plus bacteria are lysed under conditions that preserve chromosome, approximately 90 % of CCC F sex factor plasmid (about 1 % of the total DNA) is found in folded chromosomes sedimenting at rates between 1, 500 and 4, 000 s. The remaining 10 % of the <b>CCC</b> F <b>DNA</b> sediments at the rate (80 S) indicative of the free CCC plasmid form. Reconstruction experiments in which 80 S, <b>CCC</b> F <b>DNA</b> is added to F plus or F minus bacteria before cell lysis show that exogenous F DNA does not associate with folded chromosomes. In F plus bacteria, F plasmid is harbored at a level of one or two copies per chromosomal equivalent. In bacteria producing colicin E 1, the genetic determinant of this colicin, the Col E 1 plasmid, is harbored at levels of 10 to 13 copies per chromosomal equivalent; yet, greater than 90 % of these plasmids do not cosediment with the 1, 800 S species of folded chromosome. However, preliminary evidence suggests one or two Col E 1 plasmids may associate with the 1, 800 S folded chromosome. Based on {{evidence presented}} in this and other papers, we postulate F plasmid can link to folded chromosome because the physicochemical structure of the plasmid resembles a supercoiled region of the chromosome and, therefore, is able to interact with the ribonucleic acid that stabilizes the folded chromosome structure.

A real-time PCR assay for the quantitation of total and covalently closed circular (<b>ccc)</b> HBV <b>DNA</b> in serum and in PBMCs was developed. This assay was highly sensitive (detection limit: 27 IU/mL), linear over a wide range (9 log 10), and was displayed high inter- and intra-assay reproducibility for the quantitation of total DNA. Genotypes A to E were detected and the results were consistent with those obtained with the COBAS Amplicor HBV Monitor Test. The specificity of the methodology was increased by prior treatment with an enzyme that digests relaxed circular DNA, and the elimination of background signals from virus adsorbed to the surface of PBMCs. HBV DNA was detected in the serum and PBMCs of 12 HBsAg-positive patients, with less than 1 % in the cccDNA form.

The binding to PM 2 DNA has been demonstrated by competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA), retardation of the DNA:antibody complexes in agarose gels and visualization by electron microscopy. The antibody binding {{is dependent on the}} degree of negative supercoiling. Thus, PM 2 form II and form III did not bind the antibody. The low salt RIA results indicated the presence of 200 - 400 bp of left-handed DNA per PM 2 molecule.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} antiviral agents and HBV genotypes on intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (<b>ccc</b> <b>DNA)</b> in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients. METHODS: Seventy-one patients received lamivudine (n = 35), or sequential therapy with lamivudine- interferon alpha 2 b (IFN-α 2 b, n = 24) for 48 wk, or IFN-α 2 b (n = 12) for 24 wk. All subjects were followed up for 24 wk. Intrahepatic <b>ccc</b> <b>DNA</b> was measured quantitatively by PCR. HBV genotypes were analyzed by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: Sequential lamivudine- INF-α therapy, lamivudine and INF-α monotherapy reduced <b>ccc</b> <b>DNA</b> of 1. 7 log, 1. 4 log and 0. 8 log, respectively (P < 0. 05). Seventeen out of the 71 patients developed HBeAg seroconversion, the reduction of <b>ccc</b> <b>DNA</b> in the HBeAg seroconversion patients was more significant than that in the HBeAg positive patients (3. 0 log vs 1. 6 log, P = 0. 0407). Twenty-four weeks after antiviral therapy withdrawal, 16 patients had a sustained virological response, the baseline intrahepatic <b>ccc</b> <b>DNA</b> in the patients with a sustained virological response was significantly lower than that in the patients with virological rebound (4. 6 log vs 5. 4 log, P = 0. 0472).

We found that administration of the viral DNA polymerase inhibitor, lamivudine, induced a significant drop of viral titer {{and the emergence of}} WHV drug resistant variants 5 months after the start of therapy. However, rebound of viral titers was not observed in the following 5 – 7 months. Genotyping of WHV <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> and virion DNA collected before and during lamivudine therapy showed that, before the emergence of viral titer rebound, <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> of drug resistant variants always co-existed with a significant proportion of wild type <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA,</b> even when drug resistant variants were the dominant viruses in serum. This phenomenon indicates the spread of drug resistant variants was hampered by pre-occupancy of hepatocytes by wild type virus. The slow replacement of wild type <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> in the presence of lamivudine supports the concept that <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> is stable in vivo. ^ We next asked if cytokines were capable of eliminating both hepadnavirus replicative intermediates and <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> in a natural chronic infection model. Recombinant adenovirus was injected into woodchucks chronically infected with WHV to induce a bystander effect. Biopsy samples obtained at two-week post adenovirus infection showed a 2 – 3 fold elevated expression of INF-γ, TNF-α and T cell markers, accompanied by a 10 – 20 fold reduction of WHV replicative intermediate DNA. At the same time, <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> and viral mRNA declined around 3 -fold. Since the clearance of adenovirus infected hepatocytes in the first two weeks was relatively slow (around 50 % based on X-gal staining), the dramatic reduction of replicative intermediate DNA during the same period, by inference, could be attributed to the noncytolytic effect of cytokines. On the other hand, cytokines induced by adenovirus under the current experiment conditions had no clear effect on <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA.</b> Based on the significant increase of hepatocyte turnover, as indicated by PCNA staining, the moderate loss of <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> might be the result of cell lysis mediated by adenovirus specific CTL. ...|$|E

40|$|Replication of hepadnaviruses {{requires}} a persistent population of covalently closed circular (<b>CCC)</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules in {{the nucleus of}} the infected cell. It is widely accepted that the vital role of this molecule is to be the sole DNA template for the synthesis by RNA polymerase II of all viral transcripts throughout the infection process. Since the transcriptional activity of eukaryotic nuclear DNA is considered to be determined in part by its specific organization as chromatin, the nucleoprotein disposition of the hepadnavirus <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> was investigated. These studies were undertaken on the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> present in the liver cell nuclei of DHBV-infected ducks. The organization and protein associations of the DHBV <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> in situ were inferred from sedimentation, micrococcal nuclease digestion, and DNA superhelicity analyses. These three lines of investigation demonstrate that the DHBV <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> is stably associated with proteins in the nuclei of infected liver cells. Moreover, they provide compelling evidence that the viral nucleoprotein complex is indeed a minichromosome composed of classical nucleosomes but in arrays that are atypical for chromatin. When the DHBV chromatin is digested with micrococcal nuclease, a ladder of viral DNA fragments that exhibits a 150 -bp repeat is produced. This profile for the viral chromatin is obtained from the same nuclei in which the duck chromatin shows the standard 200 -bp ladder. The superhelicity of the DHBV <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> ranges from 0 to 20 negative supertwists per molecule, with all possible 21 topoisomers present in each DNA preparation.

In the DHBV minichromosomes composed of 20 nucleosomes, 96. 7 % of the viral DNA is calculated to be compacted into these chromatin subunits spaced on average by 5 bp of linker DNA; other minichromosomes contain fewer nucleosomes and proportionately more linker DNA. Two major subpopulations of DHBV minichromosomes are detected with comparable prevalence. The two groups correspond to minichromosomes which contain essentially a full or half complement of nucleosomes.

Viral products {{are produced by}} transcription from multiple copies (5 – 50) of covalently closed circular (<b>ccc)</b> viral <b>DNA.</b> This cccDNA does not replicate, but can be replaced by DNA precursors that are synthesized in the cytoplasm. The present study was carried out to determine if long-term treatment with an inhibitor of viral DNA synthesis would lead to loss of virus products, including cccDNA, from the liver of woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus. Viral DNA synthesis was inhibited with the nucleoside analog, lamivudine (2 ′-deoxy- 3 ′-thiacytidine). Lamivudine treatment produced a slow but progressive decline in viral titers in serum, to about 0. 3 % or less of the initial level. However, even after maintenance of drug therapy for 3 – 12 months, > 95 % of the hepatocytes in most animals were still infected. Significant declines {{in the percentage of}} infected hepatocytes and of intrahepatic cccDNA levels were observed in only three woodchucks, two in the group receiving lamivudine and one in the placebo control group. Moreover, virus titers eventually rose in woodchucks receiving lamivudine, suggesting that drug-resistant viruses began to spread through the liver starting at least as early as 9 – 12 months of treatment. Three types of mutation that may be associated with drug resistance were found at this time, in a region upstream of the YMDD motif in the active site of the viral reverse transcriptase.

Viremia was suppressed for at least 8 months, after which drug-resistant virus began replicating to high titers. In addition, replicating viral DNAs were virtually absent from the liver after 6 weeks of treatment. In contrast, cccDNA declined more slowly, consistent with a half-life of ~ 33 to 50 days. The loss of cccDNA was comparable to that expected from the estimated death rate of hepatocytes in these woodchucks, suggesting that death of infected cells was one of the major routes for elimination of cccDNA. However, the decline in the actual number of infected hepatocytes lagged behind the decline in cccDNA, so that the average cccDNA copy number in infected cells dropped during the early phase of therapy. This observation was consistent with the possibility that some fraction of cccDNA was distributed to daughter cells in those infected hepatocytes that passed through mitosis.

One of the mutants isolated, strain AA 0019, has not only increased levels of histidinol phosphate phosphatase (hisB), but also increased levels of gluconate- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (gnd). Ultracentrifugation studies of extrachromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolated from strain AA 0019 revealed the presence of a single species of covalently closed circular (<b>CCC)</b> <b>DNA</b> that sedimented more rapidly through neutral and alkaline sucrose gradients than any of its possible plasmid precursors. From neutral sucrose gradients, sedimentation coefficients of 130, 100, and 86 S were derived, corresponding to the <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> of the large plasmid in strain AA 0019, the F′his,gnd element and the cryptic LT 2 plasmid, respectively. An Escherichia coli plasmid-free strain that upon mating had received the large 130 S plasmid also contained 86 S and 100 S <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> components.

40|$|In a {{posterior}} {{silk gland}} extract, covalently closed circular (<b>ccc)</b> <b>DNA</b> is in a superhelical state that supports more transcription of fibroin gene than does linear DNA. A HeLa cell extract showed neither the supercoiling activity nor {{the preference for}} the transcription of <b>ccc</b> <b>DNA</b> over linear DNA. These activities could {{be added to the}} HeLa cell extract. Phosphocellulose fractionation of the posterior silk gland extract yielded a flow-through fraction and a 0. 6 M KCl eluate fraction that were required for the supercoiling and for the efficient transcription of the ccc template in the acceptor HeLa cell extract. The 0. 6 M KCl fraction had a DNA topoisomerase II activity, and the flow-through fraction contained a supercoiling factor that, with the aid of topoisomerase II, introduced negative supercoils into <b>ccc</b> <b>DNA.</b> When both fractions were added to the posterior silk gland extract, more supercoiling occurred than with the extract alone. Several genes were optimally transcribed under various extents of supercoiling. The fibroin gene and adenovirus 2 major late promoter were fully transcribed as partially supercoiled templates. The sericin gene required more supercoiling for full transcription, whereas no preference for supercoiling was seen with the transcription of hsp 70.

Despite {{the absence of}} any serologic marker of HBV recurrence, however, it remains unknown whether there is occult reinfection in the liver graft. We aimed to detect and quantify the presence of intrahepatic HBV DNA in the liver grafts of patients who remain seronegative for HBsAg for more than 1 year after liver transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Liver biopsy and blood samples were obtained from 23 patients who had been receiving nucleoside analogue prophylaxis alone and remained persistently seronegative for HBsAg (medium, 40. 6 months; range, 10. 7 to 117. 8 months) after OLT for chronic hepatitis B. Liver biopsies were stained for HBsAg and HBcAg by immunohistochemical staining. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect and quantify total and covalently closed circular (<b>ccc)</b> HBV <b>DNA</b> in the liver (lowest detection limit, 10 copies/mL), serum and PBMC. Direct sequencing was used for HBV quasispecies screening. RESULTS: All serum samples were negative for HBV DNA but total &/or cccHBV DNA were detectable in the liver graft of 20 of 23 patients. It was positive in 17 of 20 liver grafts from donors seropositive for anti-HBc as compared to 1 of 3 from anti-HBc-negative donors (p= 0. 043). Pre-transplant liver biopsy specimen was available from 6 donors and intrahepatic HBV DNA was detectable in all 4 who were seropositive for anti-HBc.

40|$|Linear covalently closed (LCC) DNA minivectors {{serve to}} be {{superior}} to conventional circular covalently closed (<b>CCC)</b> plasmid <b>DNA</b> (pDNA) vectors due to enhancements to both transfection efficiency and safety. Specifically, LCC DNA minivectors have a heightened safety profile as insertional mutagenesis is inhibited by covalently closed terminal ends conferring double-strand breaks that cause chromosomal disruption and cell death in the low frequency event of chromosomal integration. The development of a one-step, E. coli based in vivo LCC DNA minivector production system enables facile and efficient production of LCC DNA minivectors referred to as DNA ministrings. This novel in vivo system demonstrates high versatility, generating DNA ministrings catered to numerous potential applications in gene therapy and vaccine development. In the present study, numerous aspects pertaining to the generation of gene therapeutics with LCC DNA ministrings have been explored with relevance to both industry and clinical settings. Through systematic assessment of induction duration, cultivation strategy, and genetic/chemical modifications, the novel in vivo system was optimized to produce high yields of DNA ministrings at ~ 90 % production efficiency. Purification of LCC DNA ministrings using anion exchange membrane chromatography demonstrated rapid, scalable purification of DNA vectors {{as well as its}} potential in the separation of different DNA isoforms. The application of a hydrogel-based strong Q-anion exchange membrane, with manipulations to salt gradient, constituted effective separation of parental supercoiled CCC precursor pDNA and LCC DNA. The resulting DNA ministrings were employed for the generation of 16 - 3 - 16 gemini surfactant based synthetic vectors and comparative analysis, through physical characterization and in vitro transfection assays, was conducted between DNA ministring derived and CCC pDNA derived lipoplexes. Differences in DNA topology were observed to induce differences in particle size and DNA protection/encapsulation upon lipoplex formation. Lastly, the in vivo DNA minivector production system successfully generated gagV 3 (BCE) LCC DNA ministrings for downstream development of a HIV DNA-VLP (Virus-like particle) vaccine, thus highlighting the capacity of such system to produce DNA ministrings with numerous potential applications. 4 month...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackgroundChagas disease, {{caused by}} the {{protozoan}} Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in Latin America and affects 10 million people worldwide. Approximately 12000 deaths attributable to Chagas disease occur annually due to chronic Chagas disease cardiomyopathy (CCC), an inflammatory cardiomyopathy presenting with heart failure and arrythmia; 30 % of infected subjects develop CCC years after infection. Genetic mechanisms {{play a role in}} differential progression to CCC, but {{little is known about the}} role of epigenetic modifications in pathological gene expression patterns in <b>CCC</b> patients’ myocardium. <b>DNA</b> methylation is the most common modification in the mammalian genome. MethodsWe investigated the impact of genome-wide cardiac DNA methylation on global gene expression in myocardial samples from end-stage CCC patients, compared to control samples from organ donors. ResultsIn total, 4720 genes were differentially methylated between CCC patients and controls, of which 399 were also differentially expressed. Several of them were related to heart function or to the immune response and had methylation sites in their promoter region. Reporter gene and in silico transcription factor binding analyses indicated promoter methylation modified expression of key genes. Among those, we found potassium channel genes KCNA 4 and KCNIP 4, involved in electrical conduction and arrythmia, SMOC 2, involved in matrix remodeling, as well as enkephalin and RUNX 3, potentially involved in the increased T-helper 1 cytokine-mediated inflammatory damage in heart.

HBV recombinant baculovirus, which efficiently delivers the HBV genome to HepG 2 cells, was used for this study because (i) antivirals can be administered prior to initiation of HBV infection or after HBV infection and (ii) sufficiently high HBV replication levels are achieved that HBV covalently closed circular (<b>CCC)</b> <b>DNA</b> can be easily detected and individual HBV DNA species can be quantitatively analyzed separately from total HBV DNA. The results showed that the levels of HBV replicative intermediate and extracellular DNA decreased in a concentration-dependent fashion following antiviral treatment. The 50 % effective concentration (EC 50) and EC 90 values and the Hill slopes differed for the different HBV DNA species analyzed. The data clearly indicated that (i) nuclear HBV DNAs are more resistant to antiviral therapy than cytoplasmic or extracellular HBV DNAs and (ii) nuclear HBV <b>CCC</b> <b>DNA</b> is more resistant than the nuclear relaxed circular form.

The effects of varying pulse time and agarose concentration on the electrophoretic mobility cccDNAs, ranging from 2 kilobase pairs (kb) to 16 kb, was investigated. We used both field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) and electrophoresis in contour-clamped homogeneous electric fields (CHEF); both ccc and linear molecules had a minimum mobility {{as a function of}} pulse time in a CHEF apparatus. Linear and cccDNAs of the same size were affected differently by pulse time. The electrophoretic mobility of cccDNAs was pulse-time dependent in both electrophoretic systems;We used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFG) and statistical analysis of Rhizobiaceae DNA sequences from GENBANK to identify rare-cutting restriction endonucleases. By using FIGE and CHEF, the genome sizes of Rhizobium meliloti and Bradyrhizobium japonicum were calculated. Comparisons were made between the genomes of free-living and bacteroid forms. The stability of genomic fingerprints produced by rare-cutting enzymes was studied on B. japonicum DNA plugs. It seems likely that large-scale DNA rearrangements do not occur during B. japonicum bacteroid development, after dedifferentiation, or by maintenance on rich media;FIGE and digestion with rare-cutting restriction enzymes were used to compare the genomes of B. japonicum field isolates from the 123 serocluster, as well as serotype strains USDA 123, USDA 127, and USDA 129. Genomic fingerprints (or field inversion gel electrophoretic types (FIGETs)), produced by four restriction enzymes, showed a high degree of diversity in the sizes of restriction fragments. Isolates could be classified according to FIGETs, and this classification was correlated with a serological classification. Hybridization with a nifHD gene probe to FIGE gels of B. japonicum DNA revealed that restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) existed within members of serocluster 123 and provided further evidence of the relatedness between members of serogroups 123 and 127...|$|R

The presence of the peptide hormone throughout infection or starting up to 8 h after virus uptake resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the levels of intra- and extracellular viral gene products and of secreted virions. Treatment with forskolin or dibutyryl-cyclic AMP, two drugs that also stimulate the cyclic AMP (cAMP) signal transduction pathway, resulted in comparable inhibition, suggesting that the inhibitor effect is related {{to changes in the}} activity of protein kinase A. In persistently infected hepatocytes, only a slight, but continuous, decrease in viral replication was observed upon prolonged drug treatment.
