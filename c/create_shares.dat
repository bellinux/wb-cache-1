30|$|Creating shared {{value is}} the {{opportunity}} driven approach of business entities to benefit the less addressed segment of the society through their core products and services. For bank financial institutions, the opportunity driven approach signifies that banking corporations ought to identify bankable needs that are less addressed or unaddressed and invest on purpose to benefit both society and business. The study strives to develop a conceptual model of how Private Commercial Banks (PCBs) in Bangladesh are <b>creating</b> <b>shared</b> value (a popular concept developed by ([Porter ME, Kramer MR], [The big idea: <b>creating</b> <b>shared</b> value; how to reinvent capitalism—and unleash a wave of innovation and growth], [2011])) through reviewing the products and services of PCBs in light of available literature {{in the field of}} strategic corporate social responsibility and <b>creating</b> <b>shared</b> value. The model has identified core products and services that are <b>creating</b> <b>shared</b> value for both the bank and the society concurrently. It has also identified factors that are limiting shared value creation capacity of PCBs. Thus, the model will assist the money market policy planners especially bankers to identify the products, services, markets, and value chain that could augment capacity of <b>creating</b> <b>shared</b> value and remove the road-blocks for <b>creating</b> upscale <b>shared</b> value in the developing country context.|$|R

30|$|The overall {{findings}} of the study suggest that the PCBs are <b>creating</b> <b>shared</b> value mostly through reconceiving their products and services and redefining their value chain to boost productivity.

In other words, PCBs in a developing country like Bangladesh are <b>creating</b> <b>shared</b> value in line with Porter and Kramer’s shared value concept.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The article {{endeavours}} {{to construct}} a model that links the gap between returns to an investment in ‘Fine Art’ and the ‘real’ price of the 'Fine Art' being traded. Thus the process used in <b>creating</b> <b>shared</b> value within the market for 'Fine Art' is examined. Art prices are usually set in the primary market through the auction process, which should also typically reflect an efficient way of <b>creating</b> <b>shared</b> value. As the auction process in the primary art market is not efficient; it does not <b>create</b> <b>shared</b> value as would occur in a typical free market structure. Artificial rigidities exist within the primary art market; thus the links between the primary art market and the secondary art market are shown by incorporating the concepts of the 'Value of Information' and ‘Strategic Uncertainty’ into the transmission mechanism...|$|R
30|$|The study {{presumes that}} the more the PCBs will {{practice}} ethical standards such as value based baking, safe custody, online transactions etc., the more they could <b>create</b> <b>shared</b> value. Managing stakeholders’ interest {{in the best possible}} ways as well as enhancing goodwill, brand image, profit, and social acceptance of business could also help <b>create</b> <b>shared</b> value. However, internal and external challenges could negatively influence shared value efforts of PCBs to scale up faster. Hence, mitigating those challenges for creating and cultivating upscale shared value is extremely desirable.|$|R
30|$|Perhaps Porter and Kramer’s (2011) most {{relevant}} contribution {{comes from the}} claim that “the purpose of the corporation must be redefined as <b>creating</b> <b>shared</b> value” (p. 2) and {{by pointing out that}} the first step to do so is the identification of the societal needs as well as the benefits or harms that the business embodies through its products. Accordingly, Porter and Kramer (2011) established three ways for <b>creating</b> <b>shared</b> value: by reconceiving products and markets, by redefining productivity in the value chain, and by creating supportive industry clusters where the company operates.|$|R

40|$|Purpose of {{the article}} The authors {{describe}} theoretical approaches and researches of intellectual capital invest-ments and present their analysis {{of the role of}} the intellectual capital investments for company’ sustainable per-formance. Deaper analysis of the concepts will help to clarify understanding if intellectual capital investments are company’s additional expenditures or a tool for <b>creating</b> <b>shared</b> value. Methodology/methods The following qualitative and quantitative research methods were used: literature re-view, logical and comparative analysis, deductive method to interpret the general information, the statistical method to group information and to analyze the different regularities, the empirical method to obtain information by conducting a survey, and induction method to interpret and generalize the survey results. Scientific aim of the paper is to analyze and assess role of intellectual capital investments for a company and interrelation with the concept of <b>creating</b> <b>shared</b> value. Findings On the one hand, intellectual capital investments in scientific literature are defined as expenditures, but on the other hand - these expenditures provide different benefits (monetary and non-monetary) for company and value for stakeholders. Therefore the concept of intellectual capital investments is connected to the concept of <b>creating</b> <b>shared</b> value and the concept of stakeholders. According to these concepts <b>creating</b> <b>shared</b> value provides benefits for different groups (stakeholders) and as a result sustainable growth for the company. Conclusions (limits, implications etc) It is difficult to increase the amount of intellectual capital investments if the company’s owner does not understand the importance of sustainable strategy. The state and other stakeholders can create most favorable conditions for sustainable development, but it cannot be effective without motivation and understanding of what is the business expectations. It means that motivation and values of each stakeholder are the main factor for <b>creating</b> <b>shared</b> value and company’s sustainable performance...|$|R

40|$|Shared {{displays}} {{are important}} tools for promoting collaboration. Ubiquitous computing presents new {{requirements for the}} design of shared display systems. Contextualisation of information at shared displays is becoming more important. The ability to rapidly <b>create</b> <b>shared</b> display systems is motivated by the fact that shared displays play central roles in collaboration. Low level implementation issues, common to shared display systems can be an obstacle for this. A toolkit for creation of such systems is therefore needed to provide basic shared display functionality to developers. This master thesis presents a toolkit for <b>creating</b> <b>shared</b> display applications on UbiCollab, a platform supporting collaborative work in ubiquitous environments. The work shows the development of the toolkit and how the toolkit can be used to <b>create</b> a <b>shared</b> display system. The toolkit takes advantage of the opportunities the UbiCollab platform provides on contextualisation of information. </p...|$|R
