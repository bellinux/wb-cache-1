5|$|The {{geometry}} of a back country ski {{depends on its}} purpose—skis suited for forested areas where loose powder can predominate may be shorter and wider than those selected for open, exposed areas where <b>compacted</b> <b>snow</b> may prevail. Sidecut on Telemark skis promotes turning in forest and rugged terrain. Width and short length aid turning in loose and deep snow. Longer, narrower and more rigid skis with sharp edges are suited for snow that has been compacted by wind or freeze-thaw. Touring ski design may represent a general-purpose compromise among these different ski conditions, plus being acceptable for use in groomed tracks. Traction may come from a textured or waxed grip zone, as with classic skis, or from ski skins, which are applied to the ski bottom for long, steep ascents and have hairs or mechanical texture that prevents sliding backwards.|$|E
5|$|Groomed trail skiing {{occurs at}} facilities, such as Nordmarka (Oslo), Royal Gorge Cross Country Ski Resort and Gatineau Park, Quebec, where trails {{are laid out}} and groomed for both classic and skate-skiing. Such {{grooming}} and track setting (for classic technique) requires specialized equipment and techniques that adapt to {{the condition of the}} snow. Trail preparation employs snow machines that tow snow compaction, texturing and track-setting devices. Groomers must adapt such equipment to the condition of the snow—crystal structure, temperature, degree of compaction, moisture content, etc. Depending on the initial condition of the snow, grooming may achieve an increase in density for new-fallen snow or a decrease in density for icy or <b>compacted</b> <b>snow.</b> Cross-country ski facilities may incorporate a course design that meets homologation standards for such organizations as the International Olympic Committee, the International Ski Federation or national standards. Standards address course distances, degree of difficulty with maximums in elevation difference and steepness—both up and downhill, plus other factors. Some facilities have night-time lighting on select trails—called lysløype (light trails) in Norwegian and elljusspår (electric light trails) in Swedish. The first lysløype were opened in 1946 in Nordmarka and at Byåsen (Trondheim).|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} was nearly {{ignored by the}} USAF for service in Vietnam, but a political rivalry with the U.S. Army and the Army's use of the CV-2 Caribou and later pre-production order for the de Havilland Canada C-8 Buffalo, led to a decision to deploy C-123s there. To compete with the well-performing CV-2, the USAF and Fairchild furthered development on the C-123 {{to allow it to}} do similar work on short runways. This additional development increased the utility of the aircraft and its variants to allow it to perform a number of unique tasks, including the HC-123B which operated with the USCG fitted with additional radar equipment for search and rescue missions through 1971, and the C-123J which were fitted with retractable skis for operations in Greenland and Alaska on <b>compacted</b> <b>snow</b> runways.|$|E
2500|$|Williams Field or Willy Field [...] is a United States Antarctic Program {{airfield}} in Antarctica. Williams Field {{consists of}} two snow runways located on approximately 8 meters (25ft) of <b>compacted</b> <b>snow,</b> lying on top of 8–10ft of ice, floating over 550 meters (1,800ft) of water. The airport, which is approximately seven miles from Ross Island, serves McMurdo Station and New Zealand’s Scott Base. Until the 2009-10 summer season, Williams was the major airfield for on-continent aircraft operations in Antarctica.|$|E

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare to what degree various {{proportions}} of studded and unstudded winter tyres affect the roughness and polishing of road surfaces covered with ice and <b>compact</b> <b>snow.</b> The test was conducted on a track including two straight sections. The main section had five test lanes, each with a different proportion of cars with studded tyres: 100 %, 75 %, 50 %, 25 % and 0 % of the respective lane traffic. Each test lane included sections of ice and <b>compact</b> <b>snow</b> with subsections for constant speed, braking and acceleration. Another section had two lanes for driving at constant speed: one for cars with studded tyres and one for cars with unstudded tyres. The lane in this section was covered with <b>compact</b> <b>snow.</b> The total number of runs per test lane was 642 in the main section and 1605 in the second section.|$|R

30|$|This {{field study}} was {{designed}} to compare to what degree various proportions of studded and unstudded winter tyres affect the roughness and polishing of road surfaces covered with ice and <b>compact</b> <b>snow</b> under controlled conditions. More specifically, we aimed to replicate the main features of the test conducted by Tuononen and Sainio [14] with two major exceptions: (1) two types of typical wintry surfaces were included, i.e. surfaces covered with ice and <b>compact</b> <b>snow,</b> whereas Tuononen and Sainio focused on icy surfaces only, and (2) the use of test lanes was far more substantial than in the test of Tuononen and Sainio, i.e. we aimed to get closer to the wear of lanes in road traffic and thereby achieve more valid results.|$|R

50|$|Snow tires - Snow tires perform three functions: compaction, shear bonding and bearing. On roadways they compact {{the snow}} {{in front of them}} and provide a shear bond between the treads and the <b>compacted</b> <b>snow.</b> Off-road, they also provide bearing on the <b>compacted</b> <b>snow.</b> The bearing contact must be low enough for the tires not to sink too deeply for forward {{progress}} to become impeded by compacting {{the snow in}} front of them. Tread design is critical to snow tires used on roads and represent a tradeoff between on-snow traction and dry and wet-road comfort and handling.|$|E
50|$|The walls, fixtures, and {{fittings}} are made entirely of ice or <b>compacted</b> <b>snow,</b> and are held together using a substance known as snice, which takes {{the place of}} mortar in a traditional brick-built hotel. Sometimes steel framing is used in their construction.|$|E

30|$|The {{effects of}} tyre type on rut depth {{show that the}} depth {{increased}} much faster on <b>compact</b> <b>snow</b> than on ice during the test. In fact, the snowy surface wore so quickly and inconsistently that {{we were unable to}} accurately measure the increase in ruts. However, on icy surfaces, the more vehicles there were with studded tyres, the deeper the mean depth of ruts {{was at the end of}} the test.|$|R
30|$|Because {{the section}} with <b>compact</b> <b>snow</b> wore inconsistently, the results include more {{variance}} {{than those for}} the icy surface, but we consider them to correspond relatively well with the latter. Specifically, compared to the lane with 100 % of vehicles with studded tyres {{at the end of}} the test, the largest mean friction reduction was 22 – 23 % on snow-covered surfaces and 20 – 31 % on ice-covered surfaces.|$|R
30|$|Another {{straight}} section (B) had two lanes for driving at constant speed, one for cars with studded tyres {{and one for}} cars with unstudded tyres. The lane surfaces in this section were covered with <b>compact</b> <b>snow.</b> The main purpose of including this section in the test was to ensure interpretable results if the more complex design of section A were to fail. Both sections A and B included an additional reference lane with no test (surface-wearing) vehicles.|$|R

30|$|The {{test was}} {{conducted}} on an oval track 1.8  km in length including two straight sections. The main straight section (A) of the track had five test lanes, each with a different proportion of cars with studded tyres: 100 %, 75 %, 50 %, 25 % and 0 % of the respective lane traffic. The remainder were cars with unstudded winter tyres. Each test lane included sections of ice and <b>compact</b> <b>snow</b> with subsections for constant speed, braking and acceleration.|$|R
30|$|Test cars {{equipped}} with studded and unstudded winter tyres drove around a test track {{according to the}} designed procedure. The main straight section of the track had five lanes, each with a different proportion of cars with studded tyres: 100 %, 75 %, 50 %, 25 % and 0 % of the respective lane traffic. The remainder were cars with unstudded winter tyres. Each lane included sections of ice and <b>compact</b> <b>snow</b> with subsections for constant speed, braking and acceleration. The lanes were driven 642 times. The ambient temperature was approximately 0  °C during the test.|$|R
50|$|Snow becomes {{suitable}} for packing when it approaches its melting point and becomes moist and compact. Making a snowman of powdered snow is difficult since {{it will not}} stick to itself, and if the temperature of packing snow drops, it will form an unusable denser form of powdered snow called crust. Thus, {{a good time to}} build a snowman may be the next warm afternoon directly following a snowfall with a sufficient amount of <b>snow.</b> Using more <b>compact</b> <b>snow</b> allows {{for the construction of a}} large snowball by simply rolling it until it grows to the desired size. If the snowball reaches the bottom of the grass it may pick up traces of grass, gravel or dirt.|$|R
50|$|Water ramps into {{oversized}} pools, ponds, or lakes {{are constructed}} as training locations for aerial skiing, mogul skiing, and snowboarding acrobatics events. Such structures typically comprise three sections, in-run, a kicker, and a water surface for landing. They permit {{the practice of}} new skills with reduced risk, as {{the impact of a}} water landing is less dangerous than a comparable impact on <b>compacted</b> <b>snow.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Snow runways - In 2016, CRREL Research Civil Engineers {{designed}}, {{built and}} tested a new snow runway for the McMurdo Station, called [...] "Phoenix". It is designed accommodate approximately 60 annual sorties of heavy, wheeled transport aircraft. The <b>compacted</b> <b>snow</b> runway {{was designed and}} constructed to service a Boeing C-17 weighing more than 500,000 pounds. This required engineering knowledge of the properties of mechanically-hardened snow.|$|E
5000|$|This system {{measures}} {{the difficulty of}} routes on water ice. The WI scale spans grades from 1 to 7. There also exists a rating scale for Alpine Ice (<b>compacted</b> <b>snow</b> or glacial ice) that has the same rating system as the [...] "WI" [...] system, but is instead denoted by [...] "AI." [...] The primary {{difference between the two}} is the density of the ice, Water Ice being much more dense.|$|E
2500|$|In modern times, the {{creation}} of relatively simple dome-like structures has been documented among various indigenous peoples around the world. The wigwam was made by Native Americans using arched branches or poles covered with grass or hides. The Efé people of central Africa construct similar structures, using leaves as shingles. Another example is the igloo, a shelter built from blocks of <b>compact</b> <b>snow</b> and used by the Inuit people, among others. The Himba people of Namibia construct [...] "desert igloos" [...] of wattle and daub for use as temporary shelters at seasonal cattle camps, and as permanent homes by the poor. Extraordinarily thin domes of sun-baked clay 20 feet in diameter, 30 feet high, and nearly parabolic in curve, are known from Cameroon.|$|R

5|$|A snow groomer is {{a machine}} {{designed}} to smooth and <b>compact</b> the <b>snow,</b> rather than removing it altogether. Early snow groomers {{were used by}} residents of rural areas to compress the snow close to their homes, and consisted of a heavy roller hauled by oxen which <b>compacted</b> the <b>snow</b> to make a smooth surface for sledging. With {{the invention of the}} motor car, snow groomers were replaced by snowplows and snow blowers on public thoroughfares, but remained in use at ski resorts, where they are used to maintain smooth, safe trails for various wintersports, including skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling. Snow groomers remained unchanged throughout the 20th century, with most consisting of heavy roller which could be attached to a tractor or snowcat and then hauled across the area to be groomed.|$|R
