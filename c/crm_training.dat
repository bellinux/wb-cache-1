40|$|Crew Resource Management (CRM) skill {{identification}} and specification has been problematic with difficulties becoming {{apparent in the}} broader context of the training enterprise especially {{in the areas of}} crew assessment and operational integration. Airlines have developed listings of CRM skills over the last ten years with many working at the more general marker level. There has been a recent shift from general markers to the more detailed observable behaviors which has provide an airline with more focused assessments, but there are still problems integrating the behaviors across flight operations. Airlines need a flexible, iterative method to identify, specify, and link CRM skills to key elements of training and flight operations. Such a method should be adaptable to the operational and organizational factors essential to the long-term implementation of a skill-based training program.

40|$|The {{majority}} of aviation {{incidents and accidents}} are attributable to human error (Billings & Reynard, 1984). Most of these human errors involve the ineffective use of team process factors, which are {{often referred to as}} Crew Resource Management (CRM) skills in the commercial aviation literature (Helmreich & Foushee, in press). In addition to these applied concerns, a revised version of McGrath's (1964) theory of group performance (Foushee & Helmreich, 1988) suggests that one must analyze the process (i. e., team process) by which a group's inputs (e. g., personality, attitudes) are transformed into group outcomes (e. g., task performance, mission safety) in order to understand how a task-oriented group functions.

The flying {{experience}} of participants was between 354 and 220 hours {{with an average of}} 292 hours. Participants were randomly divided into two groups, 21 pilots in the experimental group, and 20 pilots in control group. Two ADM mnemonic methods, SHOR and DESIDE, that had been previously been assessed by instructor pilots as being the most applicable and having the potential to significantly improve the quality of military pilots’ decision-making formed the basis of the ADM training programs. Overall, results from both the simulator-based trials (which assessed the product of the ADM training programme) and the pencil-and-paper tests (which assessed the process that the trainees applied) showed gains being made in both Situation Assessment and Risk Management skills attributable to the decision making training course. The results strongly suggest that such a short training course can be effective in terms of improving pilots’ skill in situation assessment and risk management. However, these gains were at the cost of a decreased speed of responding. Nevertheless, it is suggested that a simple, short, cost-effective training program in the appropriate use of ADM mnemonic methods may ultimately produce significant gains in flight safety.

40|$|Thesis (MBA (Business Management)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} approaches to CRM within the luxury hotel sector in Cape Town in order to add value not only to guests, but to all stakeholders of the hotel. This was done by conducting a literature review, supported by a sound base of primary research. The findings proved that CRM theory holds true for most luxury hotels and the notion that luxury hotels in modern times cannot afford to be without a CRM initiative, was underpinned. Furthermore, the concept of an aligned strategy and vision in terms of a hotel's CRM approach was found to be integral. Staff buy-in and co-operation are of utmost importance for any hotel property implementing a <b>CRM</b> initiative. Additionally, <b>training</b> and education on the importance of CRM was highlighted as an important factor to get all staff on board. Management needs to become customer relationship management experts themselves in order to inspire and motivate staff to excel at building relationships with guests. Moreover, the common mistake of hotels to place greater impetus on <b>CRM</b> technology than <b>training</b> and lack of leveraging CRM investments was examined as some of the main reasons for the failure of CRM initiatives. Although CRM technologies are extremely powerful tools and may facilitate a hotel's CRM strategy, they cannot be viewed in isolation and made responsible for the success of such a programme. Training is vital to enable staff to use these systems optimally and to turn guest data into gold. The importance of people was also emphasised in the light of personalisation of service; having the correct staff with an aptitude for guest service and hospitality is imperative. Lastly, the concept of customer-centric processes and systems was stressed. Everything a hotel does in terms of CRM efforts should be derived from the notion of guest satisfaction. Guest satisfaction is the one essential element that will enable a hotel to flourish and enjoy a firm base of repeat business. Repeat business is the most rewarding type of business for a hotel as it means that guests are satisfied with their service and will promote the hotel to others at no additional cost to the hotel. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die doel van hierdie navorsingstuk was om die houding van luukse hotelle in Kaapstad teenoor kliënte verhoudingsbestuur (KVB) te bepaal en vas te stel hoe alle aandeelhouers van die hotel voordeel kan trek uit KVB. Die doelwit was bereik met behulp van primêre en sekondêre navorsing. Die bevindinge het bewys dat KVB teoreties waarde toevoeg tot meeste luukse hotelle. Die feit is geboekstaaf dat luukse hotelle nie sonder KVB kan oorleef nie. Dit was ook gevind dat 'n geintegreerde strategie en visie van uiterste belang is in KVB in hotelle. Personeel samewerking en entoesiasme is ook uitgelig as belangrike elemente wat die sukses van KVB bepaal. In hierdie opsig, was opleiding 'n integrale faktor tot die bevordering van personeel deelname. Die bestuur van hotelle moet self kundiges raak op die gebied van KVB om sodoende personeel te inspireer en motiveer om ook waardevolle kliënteverhoudinge te bou. Algemene foute wat hotelle begaan in terme van KVB is die feit dat meer klem gelê word op KVB tegnologie as op opleiding en dat die opbrengs op die inisiële belegging in KVB nie in ag geneem word nie. Alhoewel KVB tegnologie van onskatbare waarde is om 'n hotel se KVB strategie suksesvol te maak, kan die sukses van so 'n strategie nie alleenlik daaraan toegeskryf word nie. Ten einde die personeel te bemagtig om hierdie sisteme optimaal te benut, moet opleiding weereens as 'n area van belang beklemtoon word. Nog 'n prioriteit is die kwaliteit van personeel wat aangestel word; personeel moet 'n natuurlike aanvoeling hê vir kliënte diens en persoonlike interaksie...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{descriptive}} research aimed at accessing and describing the CRM practices of hotels in Ghana. The main objective of study was to classify the hotels in Ashanti region of Ghana into two categories - low CRM conscious and high CRM conscious {{with respect to the}} four behavoural components of CRM (Key Customer Focus, CRM Organization, Knowledge Management, and Technology-based CRM.) proposed by Sin, Tse and Yim (2004). The target population of the study was hotels in Ghana. Hotels in Ashanti region was taken as the sample size of the study. The major findings of the study are that hotels with high ‗star ratings‘ reported high level of CRM practices, consciousness and orientation than the hotels with low ‗star ratings‘. It was found that the level of CRM consciousness and orientation of the hotels vary with respect to the four dimensions (Key Customer Focus, CRM Organization, Knowledge Management, and Technology-based CRM.). The Technology-based CRM dimension recorded the lowest level of orientation among the hotels and the Knowledge Management dimension recorded the highest level of orientation. Again, {{the results of the study}} suggest that significant majority of the hotels exhibit high level of orientation to the Key Customer Focus dimension and Knowledge Management dimension of CRM. Likewise, the findings suggest that a significant majority of the hotels exhibit low level of orientation towards the CRM Organization dimension, and the Technology-based CRM dimension of CRM. The study recommends that the government of Ghana should consider a policy that will encourage management of hotels to practice CRM. For example, government could institute a day to create awareness and to award hotels for best CRM practice as in the case of farmers and teachers. The hotel industry could also institute award night to create awareness of the importance CRM practices to the industry and to encourage good CRM practices among hotels of the industry as in the case of the Ghana music industry. This will go a long way to encourage the hotels and make them conscious of their customers. It is recommended that since majority of the customer service officers of the hotels have low level of education and experience, management of the hotels should consider engaging more qualified and experienced <b>CRM</b> officers or <b>train</b> the existing <b>CRM</b> officers to handle CRM issues of the hotels. Against the findings that the use of technology is low among the hotels, it is recommended that the hotels should make maximum use of the existing level of information technology to leverage effective and efficient CRM practice.

40|$|Values can be {{described}} as verbal representations of desirable life states (Rokeach, 1973), that can influence moment to moment behaviour (Hayes, 2004). For individuals, values can act like a compass or set of guiding principles that shape and direct choices and actions, particularly in times of conflict or competing priorities. Organisationally, including within the mental health recovery field, the adoption of values statements as a set of guiding principles is common both at the service level and within policy (Farkas 2 ̆ 6 Gagne, 2005). Though these high-level practices are aimed at shaping behaviour of individuals in organisations, research has not previously examined the specific and targeted use of interventions to promote autonomous uptake of desired behaviours by newly trained mental health workers. The motivation of individual staff is often overlooked when organisations attempt to create behavioural changes (Baldwin 2 ̆ 6 Ford, 1998, Ferlie, Fitzgerald, Wood 2 ̆ 6 Hawkins, 2005). The current research investigates the utility of values-based interventions as a means of fostering self-determined commitment to changed work practices. Within organisations, staff wellbeing is increasingly acknowledged as critical to effectiveness (e. g.,, Ramlall, 2013) and is highly relevant in the mental health context where employee 2 ̆ 2 ill-being 2 ̆ 2 is high (Maslach 2 ̆ 6 Jackson, 1981; Russinova et al, 2011). Henceforth, the current research also seeks to clarify the link between autonomous motivation and increased employee wellbeing. The format of the thesis is as follows: Chapter 1 introduces the bodies of literature underpinning this research, first providing a background to mental health recovery and the acknowledged challenges of operationalising a recovery vision into practice (Slade, 2012; Farkas 2 ̆ 6 Gagne, 2005). Theory related to values and Self Determination Theory (SDT – Deci 2 ̆ 6 Ryan, 1985 b) is described, with a specific focus on the potential applicability of values interventions as a specific form of autonomy support, extending the current literature beyond a set of general principles. Chapter 2 elaborates understanding of the concepts autonomy and autonomous motivation, in addition to detailing the continuum model of motivation acknowledged within SDT. Internalisation – the process through which low autonomy behaviours become more autonomously motivated according to SDT – is described with reference to the current understanding of autonomy supportive practices. Finally, the concept of values as a novel form of autonomy supportive practices to facilitate internalisation of socially determined behaviours and principles is expanded upon to aide deeper conceptual understanding of the processes being targeted in this research. Chapter 3 outlines the full protocol of this research. Chapter 4 details an investigation of the impact of a values-focused staff intervention as an adjunct to training in an evidence-based recovery framework (Collaborative Recovery Model - CRM Oades et al., 2005) and compares it to a more traditional method of implementation support. A total of 146 mental health workers from 5 community managed organisations delivering recovery services to individuals across 4 Australian states were randomised to either the values or implementation support condition according to their worksite. Results indicated that values clarification and commitment promoted increased autonomous commitment and plans to implement the newly <b>trained</b> <b>CRM</b> practices compared to implementation planning intervention. Additionally, a specific component of highly autonomous motivation (integrated motivation) was identified as relevant in this context where goals are socially controlled. Chapter 5 details a longitudinal investigation comparing the impact of ongoing values versus implementation focused staff intervention on CRM related goal striving, and staff wellbeing. Contrary to hypotheses, {{there was no difference in}} successful striving towards CRM related goals or wellbeing of mental health workers across a range of measures between the experimental conditions after 6 -months. In effort to extend the findings detailed in Chapter 4, this chapter examines the relationship between changes in integrated motivation (i. e., a highly relevant component of autonomous motivation), successful striving toward the CRM principles, and mental health worker wellbeing. Results from the 116 participants who completed intervention components at 6 months indicated a significant positive correlation between increases in integrated motivation and increased successful striving toward CRM principles. Increases in integrated motivation were also significantly negatively correlated with one aspect of employee wellbeing, namely, burnout. The hypothesis that increases in integrated motivation mediates the relationship between changes in successful CRM goal striving and burnout was tested, with modest support for the unique influence of integrated motivation. Chapter 6 outlines limitations in the coaching protocol, issues related to participant attrition and data loss, in addition to specific issues related to the measurement of key variables (e. g., self-reported rather than objectively rated goal striving). The chapter concludes with suggestions for further research. Overall, the current research suggests purposeful targeting of values as an adjunct to traditional training may promote greater autonomous motivation within mental health workers. The motivational component “integrated motivation” seems to have particular relevance to optimising autonomous motivation in controlled contexts like the workplace. However, further research to strengthen the effectiveness and fully understand the relevance of values interventions as a method of autonomy supportive practices is required to support translation of increased planned implementation of the CRM principles in to changed practice...|$|R
5000|$|On October 16, 2001, an EMB 145 was {{on final}} {{approach}} to Roanoke, Virginia. The captain had briefed a [...] "no go-around" [...] {{for a night}} visual approach to a [...] "Special Airport". The approach was not stabilized, and the airspeed decreased {{to the point of}} a stall. The airplane struck the runway in a nose high pitch attitude, the aft fuselage struck the runway first then settled on the landing gear. The first officer made initial call-outs of slow airspeed and then stopped when the captain failed to respond to her callouts. After landing, the airplane was taxied to the gate where a post-flight inspection limited to the main landing gear did not find the damage to the tail section. The incident was not reported by either pilot to the company and the airplane was allowed to be flown by the next crew the following morning on its scheduled service back to Charlotte, North Carolina, where a post flight inspection revealed the tail strike. When interviewed, the captain first denied having been involved in a hard landing and speculated that the tail strike must have been the result of an over rotation on takeoff from the morning crew. When faced with the CVR and FDR data, she eventually admitted to the incident. She reported that she briefed [...] "no go-around" [...] because no takeoffs were authorized on the runway at night or in IMC conditions; however, the first officer knew this was incorrect, but did not challenge the captain. Both pilots had received <b>CRM</b> <b>training,</b> which included crew member assertiveness, methods of fostering crew input, and situational awareness, and training on special use airports; however it was not followed by either pilot. The captain said the first officer was passive and quiet. The first officer reported the captain was defensive and did not take criticism very well. It is remarkable that the damage to the tail section was not discovered during the preflight visual inspection performed by the morning flight or ground crews. The aircraft had an MELed APU and needed the engines to be started with the assistance of an external air cart. The connection for the air cart is located at the aft bottom fuselage section where the damages were visible. The access panel was bent. Yet the ground crew did not notify the flight deck crew. When the walk-around visual inspection was performed by the morning crew's first officer, it was performed during the hours of darkness {{with the help of a}} flashlight. The air cart was already connected and forced the first officer to walk around the cart and away from the aircraft, missing the tail strike damages. [...] Both crews were terminated from employment; however, the first officer of the accident flight and the captain of the morning flight were eventually reinstated with help of their union (ALPA). The accident captain was able to recover her certificates and privileges but was not reinstated. The first officer from the morning crew died from illness prior to being reinstated.|$|E
