60|$|The {{next day}} Mr. Fotheringay heard two {{interesting}} items of news.

6000|$|Stealthily {{he began}} to {{approach}} the house. He stood by the <b>climbing</b> <b>rose</b> of the porch, listening. He heard voices upstairs. Perhaps the children would be downstairs. He listened intently. Voices were upstairs only. He quietly opened the door. The room was empty, save for the baby, who was cooing in her cradle. He crossed to the hall. At {{the foot of the}} stairs he could hear the voice of the Indian doctor: [...] "Now little girl, you must just keep still and warm in bed, and not cry for the moon." [...] He said [...] "de moon," [...] just as ever.--Marjory must be ill.|$|E

60|$|Up, into a vast amphitheatre of sward, whose walls banked out {{the narrow}} sky above. And here, {{in the focus}} of the huge ring, an object {{appeared}} which stirred strange melancholy in Lancelot,--a little chapel, ivy-grown, girded with a few yews, and elders, and grassy graves. A <b>climbing</b> <b>rose</b> over the porch, and iron railings round the churchyard, told of human care; and from the graveyard itself burst up one of those noble springs known as winter-bournes in the chalk ranges, which, awakened in autumn from the abysses to which it had shrunk during the summer's drought, was hurrying down upon its six months' course, a broad sheet of oily silver over a temporary channel of smooth greensward.|$|E
60|$|In such {{a village}} as my colored brother drove me {{through on the}} way to the beach it was of an {{absolute}} fitness; and I wish I could convey a due sense of the exquisite keeping of the place. Each white house was more or less closely belted in with a white fence, of panels or pickets; the grassy door-yards glowed with flowers, and often a <b>climbing</b> <b>rose</b> embowered the door-way with its bloom. Away backward or sidewise stretched the woodshed from the dwelling to the barn, and shut the whole under one cover; the turf grew to the wheel-tracks of the road-way, over which the elms rose and drooped; and from one end of the village to the other you could not, as the saying is, find a stone to throw at a dog. I know Holland; I have seen the wives of Scheveningen scrubbing up for Sunday to the very middle of their brick streets, but I doubt if Dutch cleanliness goes so far without, or comes from so deep a scruple within, as the cleanliness of New England. I felt so keenly the feminine quality of its motive as I passed through that village, that I think if I had dropped so much as a piece of paper in the street I must have knocked at the first door and begged the lady of the house (who would have opened it in person after wiping her hands from her work, taking off her apron, and giving a glance at herself in the mirror and at me through the window blind) to report me to the selectmen in the interest of good morals.|$|E
60|$|A strange {{impulse was}} sharp in her, {{but it was}} not, for her part, the desire to shift the weight. She could as little have slept as she could have slept that morning, days before, when she had watched the first dawn from her window. Turned to the east, this side of her room was now in shade, with the two wings of the {{casement}} folded back and the charm she always found in her seemingly perched position--as if her outlook, from above the high terraces, was that of some castle-tower mounted on a rock. When she stood there she hung over, over the gardens and the woods--all of which drowsed below her, at this hour, in the immensity of light. The miles of shade looked hot, the banks of flowers looked dim; the peacocks on the balustrades let their tails hang limp and the smaller birds lurked among the leaves. Nothing therefore would have appeared to stir in the brilliant void if Maggie, at the moment {{she was about to}} turn away, had not caught sight of a moving spot, a clear green sunshade in the act of descending a flight of steps. It passed down from the terrace, receding, at a distance, from sight, and carried, naturally, so as to conceal the head and back of its bearer; but Maggie had quickly recognised the white dress and the particular motion of this adventurer--had taken in that Charlotte, of all people, had chosen the glare of noon for an exploration of the gardens, and that she could be betaking herself only to some unvisited quarter deep in them, or beyond them, that she had already marked as a superior refuge. The Princess kept her for a few minutes in sight, watched her long enough to feel her, by the mere betrayal of her pace and direction, driven in a kind of flight, and then understood, for herself, why the act of sitting still had become impossible to either of them. There came to her, confusedly, some echo of an ancient fable--some vision of Io goaded by the gadfly or of Ariadne roaming the lone sea-strand. It brought with it all the sense of her own intention and desire; she too might have been, for the hour, some far-off harassed heroine--only with a part to play for which she knew, exactly, no inspiring precedent. She knew but that, all the while--all the while of her sitting there among the others without her--she had wanted to go straight to this detached member of the party and make somehow, for her support, the last demonstration. A pretext was all that was needful, and Maggie after another instant had found one. She had caught a glimpse, before Mrs. Verver disappeared, of her carrying a book--made out, half lost in the folds of her white dress, the dark cover of a volume that was to explain her purpose in case of her being met with surprise, and the mate of which, precisely, now lay on Maggie's table. The book was an old novel that the Princess had {{a couple of days before}} mentioned having brought down from Portland Place in the charming original form of its three volumes. Charlotte had hailed, with a specious glitter of interest, the opportunity to read it, and our young woman had, thereupon, on the morrow, directed her maid to carry it to Mrs. Verver's apartments. She was afterwards to observe that this messenger, unintelligent or inadvertent, had removed but one of the volumes, which happened not to be the first. Still possessed, accordingly, of the first while Charlotte, going out, fantastically, at such an hour, to cultivate romance in an arbour, was helplessly armed with the second, Maggie prepared on the spot to sally forth with succour. The right volume, with a parasol, was all she required--in addition, that is, to the bravery of her general idea. She passed again through the house, unchallenged, and emerged upon the terrace, which she followed, hugging the shade, with that consciousness of turning the tables on her friend which we have already noted. But so far as she went, after descending into the open and beginning to explore the grounds, Mrs. Verver had gone still further--with the increase of the oddity, moreover, of her having exchanged the protection of her room for these exposed and shining spaces. It was not, fortunately, however, at last, that by persisting in pursuit one didn't arrive at regions of admirable shade: this was the asylum, presumably, that the poor wandering woman had had in view-- several wide alleys, in particular, of great length, densely overarched with the <b>climbing</b> <b>rose</b> and the honeysuckle and converging, in separate green vistas, at a sort of umbrageous temple, an ancient rotunda, pillared and statued, niched and roofed, yet with its uncorrected antiquity, like that of everything else at Fawns, conscious hitherto of no violence from the present and no menace from the future. Charlotte had paused there, in her frenzy, or what ever it was to be called; the place was a conceivable retreat, and she was staring before her, from the seat to which she appeared to have sunk, all unwittingly, as Maggie stopped at the beginning of one of the perspectives.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To study {{biometric}} {{characteristics of}} <b>climbing</b> <b>roses</b> leaves (length of compound leaf, {{the number of}} leaf blades, total leaf area and leaf blade area) and select the best varieties on this base. Methods. General biological (biometric) study and statistical evaluation. Results. As follows from the morphological analysis, a significant leaf size variation in the studied varieties of <b>climbing</b> <b>roses</b> was revealed. The leaf size in such varieties as ‘Kahovka’, ‘Flammentanz’, ‘Krasnyi Maiak’ was the largest, in ‘New Dawn’ and ‘Krymskoe Solnyshko’ – the smallest one. Based on the leaf biometric study of 9 varieties of <b>climbing</b> <b>roses,</b> the authors defined that ‘Flammentanz’, ‘Krasnyi Maiak’, ‘Kahovka’ varieties had the highest values of leaf parameters. The ‘Veilchenblau’ variety differed significantly from the other studied samples by the form and color of leaves that had {{a positive impact on}} its decorative value. Data obtained allowed to select varieties {{that can be used in}} landscaping not only because of flower decorative characteristics, but also due to attractive leaf appearance, as well as varieties for application in breeding programs related to this trait. Conclusions. Biometric characteristics of <b>climbing</b> <b>roses</b> leaves (length of compound leaf, the number of leaf blades, total leaf area and leaf blade area) were studied, and in compliance with the results the best varieties were selected that can be re­commended for use in gardening and breeding...|$|R

50|$|Sam McGredy IV, {{along with}} fellow Ulsterman and rose hybridizer Pat Dickson, campaigned for {{passage of a}} Plant Breeders' Rights act in the UK, {{starting}} in 1955. At the time, anyone could propagate a new rose and sell it with no payment to the hybridizer. Rose hybridizers only made money on their creations for the year or two {{that they had a}} head start on their competitors. Most rose hybridizers owned a nursery for the propagation and sale of plants, which supported their hybridizing. The Plant Breeders' Rights Act was passed in 1964, allowing McGredy IV to secure rights to the <b>climbing</b> <b>rose</b> 'Handel'.|$|E
50|$|The {{gardens are}} well known for the famous Kiftsgate rose, a scented <b>climbing</b> <b>rose,</b> which is shade-tolerant and very vigorous. It is claimed that the Rosa filipes 'Kiftsgate' is the largest rose in Britain {{measuring}} 80 ft x 90 feet x 50 ft high at last measurement, as reported on the Kiftsgate website. It was planted in 1938 and named by Graham Stuart Thomas in 1951. The same official website says {{that it would be}} even larger were it not cut back, and the owners fear for the integrity of the beech tree which it has colonised owing to the weight of its foliage.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} literary references to A Shropshire Lad, often with characters in novels or dramas quoting a few lines or even whole poems. Since Housman's ashes were interred at St Laurence Church, Ludlow, it was visited in 1996 by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra to celebrate the centenary of A Shropshire Lad. A wall hanging named after the book is now displayed near the south door there. The book's centenary was also celebrated by Wood's Shropshire Brewery, when they named their bitter after it. In the same year, a pink <b>climbing</b> <b>rose</b> with a strong fragrance, bred by David Austin, was also named after the book.|$|E

5000|$|All {{aforementioned}} {{classes of}} roses, both Old and Modern, have [...] "climbing" [...] forms, whereby the canes of the shrubs grow {{to be much}} longer and more flexible than the normal [...] "bush" [...] forms. In the Old Garden Roses, this is often simply the natural growth habit; for many Modern <b>Roses,</b> however, <b>climbing</b> <b>roses</b> are the results of spontaneous mutations. For example, 'Climbing Peace' is designated as a [...] "Climbing Hybrid Tea," [...] for it is genetically identical to the normal [...] "shrub" [...] form of the 'Peace' hybrid tea rose, except that its canes are long and flexible, i. e. [...] "climbing." [...] Most <b>Climbing</b> <b>Roses</b> grow 8-20 feet tall and exhibit repeat blooming.|$|R
