5|$|Catastrophic injuries—defined {{as serious}} {{injury to the}} spine, spinal cord, or brain—and {{fatalities}} are uncommon in football; both have become less common since the 1970s, although {{a small number of}} them still occur each year. Both concussions and catastrophic injuries <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by helmet-to-helmet collisions as well as impact against the ground or other players' knees; in other cases, they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by players who have sustained a head injury returning to play, which can place the player at risk of sustaining a severe injury. Despite the decrease in catastrophic injuries, a greater number of NFL players have reported major injuries and shortened careers since the 1970s, in part due to the increasing size and speed of players and the use of artificial turf.|$|E

5|$|Climate {{change is}} the {{variation}} in global or regional climates over time. It reflects changes in the variability or average state of the atmosphere over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years. These changes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by processes internal to the Earth, external forces (e.g. variations in sunlight intensity) or, more recently, human activities.|$|E
5|$|Croup <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by {{a number}} of viruses {{including}} parainfluenza and influenza virus. Rarely is it due to a bacterial infection. Croup is typically diagnosed based on signs and symptoms after potentially more severe causes, such as epiglottitis or an airway foreign body, have been ruled out. Further investigations—such as blood tests, X-rays, and cultures—are usually not needed.|$|E
5|$|Impulse control {{disorders}} including pathological gambling, compulsive sexual behavior, binge eating, compulsive {{shopping and}} reckless generosity <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by medication, particularly orally active dopamine agonists. The dopamine dysregulation syndrome – with wanting of medication leading to overusage – {{is a rare}} complication of levodopa use (Giovannoni, et al. 2000).|$|E
5000|$|Secondary - defect lies {{outside of}} the gonad: e.g. Polycystic ovary syndrome, and Kallmann syndrome, also called hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Hemochromatosis and {{diabetes}} mellitus <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>causes</b> of this as well.|$|R

5|$|Many {{of these}} systems made {{landfall}} shortly after weakening from a Category5. This weakening <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by dry air near land, shallower waters due to shelving, interaction with land, or cooler waters near shore. In southern Florida, the return period for a Category5 hurricane is roughly once every 50 years.|$|E
5|$|After the {{shakeout}} of {{the casting}} it is inspected for defects. The most common defects are misruns and cold shuts. These defects <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by cold dies, low metal temperature, dirty metal, lack of venting, {{or too much}} lubricant. Other possible defects are gas porosity, shrinkage porosity, hot tears, and flow marks. Flow marks are marks left {{on the surface of}} the casting due to poor gating, sharp corners, or excessive lubricant.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{condition}} is otitis externa (outer ear infections), which {{is common to}} a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them more prone to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} science, starvation is {{a problem}} encountered in concurrent computing where a process is perpetually denied necessary resources to process its work. Starvation may <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by errors in a scheduling or mutual exclusion algorithm, but <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by resource leaks, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> intentionally <b>caused</b> via a denial-of-service attack such as a fork bomb.|$|R

5|$|Anterior cord syndrome, due {{to damage}} to the front portion of the spinal cord or {{reduction}} in the blood supply from the anterior spinal artery, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks. Below the level of injury, motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost, while sense of touch and proprioception (sense of position in space) remain intact. These differences are due to the relative locations of the spinal tracts responsible {{for each type of}} function.|$|E
5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} dogs that have long, {{pendulous}} ears are more predisposed to ear problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold of the ear can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an inflammation of the ear canal which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> {{by a variety of}} factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{replication}} is for {{the most}} part extremely accurate, however errors (mutations) do occur. The error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as 10−8 per nucleotide per replication, whereas for some RNA viruses it can be as high as 10−3. This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations. Small mutations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by missense (change a codon to encode a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature stop codon). Larger mutations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome. Additionally, DNA repair mechanisms can introduce mutational errors when repairing physical damage to the molecule. The repair, even with mutation, is more important to survival than restoring an exact copy, for example when repairing double-strand breaks.|$|E

5|$|Gene flow is the {{exchange}} of genes between populations and between species. It can therefore {{be a source of}} variation that is new to a population or to a species. Gene flow <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by the movement of individuals between separate populations of organisms, as might be caused by the movement of mice between inland and coastal populations, or the movement of pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations of grasses.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the road surface, vibrations in a motorcycle <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as engine balance shafts, rubber engine mounts, and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems designed to reduce it. Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be abated by changing the air flow over key parts, such as the windshield.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} {{protected}} by the skull, suspended in cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier. However, the brain is still susceptible to damage, disease, and infection. Damage <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by trauma, or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke. The brain is susceptible to degenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, dementias including Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia and clinical depression, {{are thought to be}} associated with brain dysfunctions. The brain can also be the site of tumours, both benign and malignant; these mostly originate from other sites in the body.|$|E

5|$|The prepatellar bursa and the {{olecranon}} bursa {{are the two}} bursae {{that are}} most likely to become infected, or septic. Septic bursitis typically occurs when the trauma to the knee causes an abrasion, though it is also possible for the infection to be caused by bacteria traveling through the blood from a pre-existing infection site. In approximately 80% of septic cases, the infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus; other common infections are Streptococcus, Mycobacterium, and Brucella. It is highly unusual for septic bursitis to be caused by anaerobes, fungi, or Gram-negative bacteria. In very rare cases, the infection <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Weld spatter, {{while not}} {{affecting}} {{the integrity of}} the weld, damages its appearance and increases cleaning costs. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by excessively high current, a long arc, or arc blow, a condition associated with direct current characterized by the electric arc being deflected away from the weld pool by magnetic forces. Arc blow can also cause porosity in the weld, as can joint contamination, high welding speed, and a long welding arc, especially when low-hydrogen electrodes are used.|$|E
5|$|In other diseases, {{defects in}} nuclear genes lead to {{dysfunction}} of mitochondrial proteins. This {{is the case}} in Friedreich's ataxia, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and Wilson's disease. These diseases are inherited in a dominance relationship, as applies to most other genetic diseases. A variety of disorders <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by nuclear mutations of oxidative phosphorylation enzymes, such as coenzyme Q10 deficiency and Barth syndrome. Environmental influences may interact with hereditary predispositions and cause mitochondrial disease. For example, there may be a link between pesticide exposure and the later onset of Parkinson's disease. Other pathologies with etiology involving mitochondrial dysfunction include schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, cardiovascular disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, and diabetes mellitus.|$|E
