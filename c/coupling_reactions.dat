ILs are an appealing medium for the formation and stabilization of catalytically active transition metal nanoparticles. More importantly, ILs can be made that incorporate coordinating groups, for example, with nitrile groups on either the cation or anion (CN-IL). In various C-C <b>coupling</b> <b>reactions</b> catalyzed by a palladium catalyst, it has been found that palladium nanoparticles are better stabilized in CN-IL compared to non-functionalized ionic liquids; thus enhanced catalytic activity and recyclability are realized.|$|E

[...] They {{also tend to be}} thermally unstable, which can be useful in certain <b>coupling</b> <b>reactions.</b> Despite these difficulties, organocopper reagents are frequently generated and consumed in situ with no attempt to isolate them. They are used very frequently in organic chemistry as alkylating reagents because they exhibit greater functional group tolerance than corresponding Grignard and organolithium reagents. The electronegativity of copper is much higher than its next-door neighbor in the group 12 elements, zinc, suggesting diminished nucleophilicity for its carbon ligands.|$|E
2500|$|CuI {{is used as}} a reagent {{in organic}} synthesis. In {{combination}} with 1,2- or 1,3 diamine ligands, CuI catalyzes the conversion of aryl, heteroaryl, and vinyl bromides into the corresponding iodides. NaI is the typical iodide source and dioxane is a typical solvent (see aromatic Finkelstein reaction). [...] Aryl halides are used to form carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bonds in process such as the Heck, Stille, Suzuki, Sonogashira and Ullmann type <b>coupling</b> <b>reactions.</b> [...] Aryl iodides, however, are more reactive than the corresponding aryl bromides or aryl chlorides. 2-Bromo-1-octen-3-ol and 1-nonyne are coupled when combined with dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II), CuI, and diethylamine to form 7-methylene-8-hexadecyn-6-ol.|$|E
2500|$|Sonogashira {{cross-coupling}} of {{aryl halides}} and alkynl groups occur with a palladium-copper co-catalyst {{in the presence}} of a base. A co-catalyst of palladium-copper is used in the coupling due to the improved reactivity that is achieved. [...] Sonogashira <b>coupling</b> <b>reactions</b> are advantageous in that the reaction has technical simplicity as well as functional group compatibility. CMPs are easily formed using this method due to the ease of rotation of alkynes in planar monomers to achieve a 3-D network. [...] The strength of these planar monomers can be tuned to control the pore diameters of CMPs. [...] Solvents in the Sonogashira coupling reaction can also play a role in the formation of CMPs. Solvents that facilitate the synthesis of CMPs best are dimethylformamide,1,4-dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran. These solvents help neutralize the formation of the hydrogen halide produced as a byproduct. A disadvantage of using terminal alkynes as a monomer, is that terminal alkynes readily undergo homocoupling under the presence of oxygen, so the reaction must be carried out without the presence of oxygen and water.|$|E
