5000|$|Additional 1108 {{hardware}} instructions included {{double precision}} arithmetic, double-word load, store, and comparison instructions. The processor could {{have up to}} 16 input/output channels for peripherals. The 1108 CPU was, {{with the exception of}} the 128-word (200 octal) ICR (Integrated Control Register) stack, entirely implemented via discrete component logic cards, each with a 55-pin high density connector, which interfaced to a machine wire wrapped backplane. Additional hand applied twisted pair wiring was utilized to implement backplane connections with sensitive timing, connections between machine wire wrapped backplanes, and connections to the I/O channel <b>connector</b> <b>panel</b> in the lower section of the CPU Cabinet. The ICR (Integrated Control Register) stack was implemented with [...] "new" [...] integrated circuit technology, replacing the thin film registers on the 1107. The ICR consisted of 128 38-bits, with a half-word Parity Bit calculated and checked with each access. The ICR was logically the first 128 memory addresses (200 Octal), but was contained in the CPU. The core memory was contained in a one or more separate cabinet(s), and consisted of two separate 32K modules, for a total capacity of 64K 38-bit words (36-bits data and a Parity Bit for each 18-bit half-word). The basic cycle time of the core memory was 750 ns, and the supporting circuitry was implemented with the same circuit card/backplane technology as the 1108 CPU.|$|E

50|$|LabVIEW {{integrates}} {{the creation}} of user interfaces (termed front panels) into the development cycle. LabVIEW programs-subroutines are termed virtual instruments (VIs). Each VI has three components: a block diagram, a front panel, and a <b>connector</b> <b>panel.</b> The last is used to represent the VI in the block diagrams of other, calling VIs. The front panel is built using controls and indicators. Controls are inputs: they allow a user to supply information to the VI. Indicators are outputs: they indicate, or display, the results based on the inputs given to the VI. The back panel, which is a block diagram, contains the graphical source code. All of the objects placed on the front panel {{will appear on the}} back panel as terminals. The back panel also contains structures and functions which perform operations on controls and supply data to indicators. The structures and functions are found on the Functions palette and can be placed on the back panel. Collectively controls, indicators, structures, and functions will be referred to as nodes. Nodes are connected to one another using wires, e.g., two controls and an indicator can be wired to the addition function so that the indicator displays the sum of the two controls. Thus a virtual instrument can be run as either a program, with the front panel serving as a user interface, or, when dropped as a node onto the block diagram, the front panel defines the inputs and outputs for the node through the connector pane. This implies each VI can be easily tested before being embedded as a subroutine into a larger program.|$|E
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{delivered}} several 64 -element linear arrays of pyroelectric elements fully integrated on silicon wafers with MOS readout devices. They have delivered detailed {{drawings of the}} linear arrays to LANL. They have processed a series of two inch wafers per submitted design. Each two inch wafer contains two 64 element arrays. After spin-coating copolymer onto the arrays, vacuum depositing the top electrodes, and polarizing the copolymer films {{so as to make}} them pyroelectrically active, each wafer was split in half. The authors developed a thicker oxide coating separating the extended gate electrode (beneath the polymer detector) from the silicon. This should reduce its parasitic capacitance and hence improve the S/N. They provided LANL three processed 64 element sensor arrays. Each array was affixed to a <b>connector</b> <b>panel</b> and selected solder pads of the common ground, the common source voltage supply connections, the 64 individual drain connections, and the 64 drain connections (for direct pyroelectric sensing response rather than the MOSFET action) were wire bonded to the <b>connector</b> <b>panel</b> solder pads.

40|$|Military and {{aerospace}} industries use Mil-Spec type electrical connections on bulkhead panels that require inline access for mate and demate operations. These connectors are usually in tight proximity to other connectors, or recessed within panels. The pliers described {{here have been}} designed to work in such tight spaces, and consist of a mirrored set of parallel handles, two cross links, two return springs, and replaceable polyurethane-coated end effectors. The polyurethane eliminates metal-to-metal contact and provides a high-friction surface between the jaw and the connector. Operationally, the user would slide the pliers over the connector shell until the molded polyurethane lip makes contact with the connector shell edge. Then, by squeezing the handles, the end effector jaws grip the connector shell, allowing the connector to be easily disconnected by rotating the pliers. Mating the connector occurs by reversing the prescribed procedure, except the connector shell is placed into the jaws by hand. The molded lip within the jaw allows the user to apply additional force for difficult-to-mate connectors. Handle design has been carefully examined to maximize comfort, limit weight, incorporate tether locations, and improve ergonomics. They have been designed with an off-axis offset for wiring harness clearance, while placing the connector axis of rotation close to the user s axis of wrist rotation. This was done to eliminate fatigue during multiple <b>connector</b> <b>panel</b> servicing. To limit handle opening width, with user ergonomics in mind, the pliers were designed using a parallel jaw mechanism.

30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the {{evaluated}} structural performance of the TRRPC-FC sandwich façade elements developed within this project. The characterization of the structural performance of the developed sandwich elements was established through experiments and modelling. The experimental part of the program consisted of characterizing the mechanical behaviour for the individual materials, components and large-scale elements. Component tests were conducted to determine a suitable <b>connector</b> and <b>panel</b> design for the elements. Four-point bending tests were performed on large-scale TRRPC-FC sandwich element beams to quantify the flexural capacity, level of composite action, resulting deformation, crack propagation and failure mechanisms. Deformations were captured during flexural testing using an optical full-field deformation measurement system based on digital image correlation (DIC). Furthermore, numerical modelling based on finite element analysis (FEA) was applied to understand the connector performance and the resulting composite action between the two RPC panels in the sandwich element.|$|R

In order to study {{the influence of the}} boundary conditions and shear connector patterns on flexural behavior of the panels, two groups of panels were cast and tested. Failure modes of the test panels under the uniformed transverse load, load-deformation response, strains in two concrete wythes, crack loads and ultimate load-bearing capacity were recorded and analysed. Test results showed that different angles and distances of plane truss shear connectors affected the ultimate flexural strengths significantly. The strain curves of two concrete wythes revealed that the plane truss shear <b>connectors</b> of <b>panels</b> worked well to make the two wythes act as a solid slab.
