5|$|During the 20th {{century and}} {{following}} the wide-scale adoption of the scientific method, astrology has been challenged successfully on both theoretical and experimental grounds, and {{has been shown to}} have no scientific validity or explanatory power. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in it has largely declined. While polling studies have demonstrated that approximately 25% of Americans, Canadians, and Britons say they <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that star and planet positions affect their lives, astrology is now recognized as pseudoscience.|$|E

25|$|Some (like the Liberals) of Sweden's {{major parties}} <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> {{it would be}} in the {{national}} interest to join, but all parties have pledged to abide by the results of the referendum, and none have shown any interest in raising the issue again. There was an agreement among the parties not to discuss the issue before the 2010 general election. In a poll from May 2007, 33.3% were in favour, while 53.8% were against and 13.0% were uncertain.|$|E
25|$|Although the McDaniels <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> Ben's body {{is in an}} area of {{the cave}} beyond the reach of current search capabilities, they have also entertained the {{possibility}} that his death was not an accident but the result of foul play. A private investigator they hired believes that his body may have been removed before any authorities were contacted, or that he may even have been murdered on land and the narrative of his disappearance fabricated as a cover story. The family believes that the suspicious, supposedly accidental, death of Vortex Spring's owner late in 2011 is related to the case. They have also criticized the local police investigation as inadequate, particularly a lie detector test passed by the employee who was the last person known to have seen Ben alive.|$|E

25|$|Dunduzu Chisiza {{had died}} in September 1962, {{apparently}} in a car crash, although many people in Malawi <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> he was murdered on Banda's instructions. Although the balance of probabilities is that Chisiza's death was accidental, {{it is clear that}} before his death, he saw the possibility of a dictatorship as a major threat. His preference was for a strong central government uniting all sectional interests and allowing dissenting views to be expressed. In a pamphlet written shortly before his death, he argued that, whereas it was necessary for the strong leadership of one individual and acceptance of his decisions during an independence struggle, once independence had been achieved, the former subordinates should cease to be submissive. He considered that a leader surrounded only by willing subordinates would soon become dictatorial; a prescient claim in view of Banda's later actions. Chisiza agreed with Banda on many issues, however on others he dissented more, and more publicly, than any other minister.|$|E
25|$|The Hungarian-American {{business}} magnate George Soros warns in “Does the Euro have a Future?” {{that there}} is no escape from the “gloomy scenario” of a prolonged European recession and the consequent threat to the Eurozone’s political cohesion so long as “the authorities persist in their current course.” He argues that to save the Euro long-term structural changes are essential in addition to the immediate steps needed to arrest the crisis. The changes he recommends include even greater economic integration of the European Union. Soros writes that a treaty is needed to transform the European Financial Stability Fund into a full-fledged European Treasury. Following the formation of the Treasury, European Council could then ask the European Commission Bank to step into the breach and indemnify the European Commission Bank in advance against potential risks to the Treasury’s solvency. Soros acknowledges that converting the EFSF into a European Treasury will necessitate “a radical change of heart.” In particular, he cautions, Germans will be wary of any such move, not least because many <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that they have a choice between saving the Euro and abandoning it. Soros writes however that a collapse of European Union would precipitate an uncontrollable financial meltdown and thus “the only way” to avert “another Great Depression” is the formation of a European Treasury.|$|E

500|$|Later observations, however, {{have caused}} the {{dopamine}} hypothesis to lose popularity, at least in its simple original form. [...] For one thing, patients with schizophrenia do not typically show measurably increased levels of brain dopamine activity. [...] Also, other dissociative drugs, notably ketamine and phencyclidine that act on glutamate NMDA receptors (and not on dopamine receptors) can produce psychotic symptoms. Perhaps most importantly, those drugs that do reduce dopamine activity are a very imperfect treatment for schizophrenia: [...] they only reduce a subset of symptoms, while producing severe short-term and long-term side effects. [...] Even so, many psychiatrists and neuroscientists <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that schizophrenia involves some sort of dopamine system dysfunction. [...] As the [...] "dopamine hypothesis" [...] has evolved over time, however, the sorts of dysfunctions it postulates have tended to become increasingly subtle and complex.|$|E
