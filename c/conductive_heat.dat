5|$|In recent years, {{in order}} to {{minimize}} labor costs in high production manufacturing, industrial welding has become increasingly more automated, most notably with the use of robots in resistance spot welding (especially in the automotive industry) and in arc welding. In robot welding, mechanized devices both hold the material and perform the weld and at first, spot welding was its most common application, but robotic arc welding increases in popularity as technology advances. Other key areas of research and development include the welding of dissimilar materials (such as steel and aluminum, for example) and new welding processes, such as friction stir, magnetic pulse, <b>conductive</b> <b>heat</b> seam, and laser-hybrid welding. Furthermore, progress is desired in making more specialized methods like laser beam welding practical for more applications, such as in the aerospace and automotive industries. Researchers also hope to better understand the often unpredictable properties of welds, especially microstructure, residual stresses, and a weld's tendency to crack or deform.|$|E

A mullite cylinder FIR heater, with a main wavelength of 4 - 7 μm, was used for FIR heating. Death of fungi by FIR heating and by thermal <b>conductive</b> <b>heating</b> both followed first-order reaction kinetics, and the apparent death rate con-stants under different temperature conditions were obtained.

25|$|As {{the cycle}} {{named after him}} doesn't waste caloric, the {{reversible}} engine has to use this cycle. Imagine now two large bodies, a hot and a cold one. He postulates now {{the existence of a}} heat machine with a greater efficiency. We couple now two idealized machine but of different efficiencies and connect them to the same hot and the same cold body. The first and less efficient one lets a constant amount of entropy ∆S = Q/T flow from hot to cold during each cycle, yielding an amount of work denoted W. If we use now this work to power the other more efficient machine, it would, using the amount of work W gained during each cycle by the first machine, make an amount of entropy ∆S' > ∆S flow from the cold to the hot body. The net effect is a flow of ∆S' − ∆S ≠ 0 of entropy from the cold to the hot body, while no net work is done. Consequently, the cold body is cooled down and the hot body rises in temperature. As the difference of temperature rises now the yielding of work by the first is greater in the successive cycles and due to the second engine difference in temperature of the two bodies stretches by each cycle evan more. In the end this set of machines would be a perpetuum mobile that cannot exist. This proves that the assumption of the existence of a more efficient engine was wrong so that an heat engine that operates the Carnot cycle must be the most efficient one. This means that a frictionless heat engine that lacks of <b>conductive</b> <b>heat</b> flow driven by a difference of temperature shows maximum possible efficiency.|$|E
500|$|The surface {{heat flow}} anomaly around the Hawaiian Swell is {{only of the}} order of 10mW/m2, far less than the {{continental}} United States range of 25 to 150mW/m2. This is unexpected for the classic model of a hot, buoyant plume in the mantle. However, {{it has been shown that}} other plumes display highly variable surface heat fluxes and that this variability may be due to variable hydrothermal fluid flow in the Earth's crust above the hotspots. This fluid flow advectively removes heat from the crust, and the measured <b>conductive</b> <b>heat</b> flow is therefore lower than the true total surface heat flux. The low heat across the Hawaiian Swell indicates that it is not supported by a buoyant crust or upper lithosphere, but is rather propped up by the upwelling hot (and therefore less-dense) mantle plume that causes the surface to rise through a mechanism known as [...] "dynamic topography".|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study we examine {{physical}} characteristics of a thin and rigid magnetic flux tube with a steady flow inside, which is embedded vertically upward in the solar atmosphere.

However, the upflow flow creates a dominant cooling which works against the <b>conductive</b> <b>heating,</b> resulting in a steeper temperature gradient with a shallower transition region.

40|$|The {{origin of}} the bimodality in cluster core entropy is still unknown. At the same time, recent work has shown that thermal {{conduction}} in clusters is likely a time-variable phenomenon. We consider if time-variable conduction and active galactic nuclei (AGN) outbursts could {{be responsible for the}} cool-core (CC), non-cool-core (NCC) dichotomy. We show that strong AGN heating can bring a CC cluster to an NCC state, which can be stably maintained by <b>conductive</b> <b>heating</b> from the cluster outskirts. On the other hand, if conduction is shut off by the heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability, then the cluster will cool to the CC state again, where it is stabilized by low-level AGN heating. Thus, the cluster cycles between CC and NCC states. In contrast with massive clusters, we predict the CC/NCC bimodality should vanish in groups, due to the lesser role of <b>conductive</b> <b>heating</b> there. We find tentative support from the distribution of central entropy in groups, though firm conclusions require a larger sample carefully controlled for selection effects...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{idealized}} model, the caloric transported from a hot to a cold body by a frictionless heat engine that lacks of <b>conductive</b> <b>heat</b> flow, {{driven by a}} difference of temperature, yielding work, {{could also be used}} to transport the caloric back to the hot body by reversing the motion of the engine consuming the same amount of work, a concept subsequently known as thermodynamic reversibility. Carnot further postulated that no caloric is lost during the operation of his idealized engine. The process being completely reversible, executed by this kind of heat engine is the most efficient possible process. The assumption that heat conduction driven by a temperature difference cannot exist, so that no caloric is lost by the engine, guided him to design the Carnot-cycle to be operated by his idealized engine. The cycle is consequently composed of adiabatic processes where no heat/caloric ∆S = 0 flows and isothermal processes where heat is transferred ∆S > 0 but no temperature difference ∆T = 0 exist. The proof of the existence of a maximum efficiency for heat engines is as follows: ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{simulation of}} steady-state intratumoral temperatures achieved {{by a simple}} modality of local heat therapy: interstitial treatment with parallel arrays of warmed, <b>conductive</b> <b>heating</b> elements. During “conductive heating” power is directly deposited only in the interstitial probes. Adjacent tissue is warmed by heat conduction. Simulations of interstitial <b>conductive</b> <b>heating</b> involved solution of the bioheat transfer equation on a digital computer using a finite difference model of the treated tissue. The simulations suggest that when the complete temperature distributions for conductive interstitial hyperthermia are examined in detail, substantial uniformity of the temperature distributions is evident. Except for a thin sleeve of tissue surrounding each heating element, a broad, flat central valley of temperature elevation is achieved, with a well defined minimum temperature, very close to modal and median tissue temperatures. Because probes are inserted directly in tumor tissue, the thin sleeve of overheated tissue would {{not be expected to}} cause normal tissue complications. The temperature of the heated probes must be continuously controlled and increased in the face of increased blood flow in order to maintain minimum tumor temperature. However, correction for changes in blood flow is possible by adjusting probe temperature according to a feedback control scheme, in which power dissipation from each probe is the sensed input variable. <b>Conductive</b> interstitial <b>heating</b> with continually controlled probe temperature deserves investigation as a technique for local hyperthermia therapy...|$|R
