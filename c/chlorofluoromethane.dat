40|$|Two basic {{assumptions}} of the simple potential model applied to the carbon 1 s electron binding energies and mean dipole moment derivatives of the fluoro-, chloro- and <b>chlorofluoromethanes</b> are examined. Although the relaxation energies of the fluoromethanes vary less than the experimental errors in the binding energy measurements, {{this is not true}} for the chloro- and <b>chlorofluoromethanes.</b> Correction of the potential model for the relaxation effects results in a statistically significant improvement in the potential model regression results. A charge-charge flux-overlap model analysis using ab initio results of MP 2 / 6 - 311 ++G(3 d, 3 p) wave function calculations shows that the total mean dipole moment derivatives are essentially equivalent to their charge contributions for the atoms in the fluoromethanes. This indicates that the mean dipole moment derivatives can be interpreted as atomic charges for these molecules. On the other hand, charge flux and overlap contributions are very important for the chloro- and <b>chlorofluoromethanes.</b> In spite of this complication the carbon 1 s binding energies and mean dipole moment derivatives can be described by the simple potential model for all the <b>chlorofluoromethanes</b> treated here. Also this model leads to a theoretical prediction of the fundamental infrared intensity sum for CCl 4 of 308. 9 km. mol- 1, slightly lower than the measured value of 322. 2 km. mol- 1...|$|R

40|$|Inert chlorofluoromethanes {{are used}} by man as {{refrigerants}} and aerosol propellants. These substances eventually escape and diffuse upward into the stratosphere. At great enough heights, UV sunlight can photodissociate these chlorofluorocarbons into chlorine atoms which will catalytically destroy ozone molecules. <b>Chlorofluoromethane</b> production has been increasing steadily {{in recent years to}} its present level of about a megaton per year, and chlorofluorocarbon usage will probably continue to grow in the future. Calculations with a one-dimensional time-dependent atmospheric model suggests that, if projected increases in <b>chlorofluoromethane</b> use materialize and there is no tropospheric destruction mechanism for these gases, the total global abundance of ozone may be reduced by more than 20 per cent over the next 50 years.

A description of the model and of the experiments is presented.

40|$|The {{ab initio}} G 2, G 2 (MP 2), CBS- 4, CBS-Q, and BAC-MP 4 {{methods have been}} used to {{calculate}} the enthalpies of formation of the series of four chloromethanes and six <b>chlorofluoromethanes</b> [CHxFyCl 4 -x-y, x) 0 - 3, y) 0 - 3]. Calculated values of ∆fH ° using the first four ab initiomethods exhibit comparatively large systematic negative errors compared with experimental values, up to- 50 kJ/mol, which are nearly linearly dependent upon the number of C-F and C-Cl bonds in the molecule. It is found for the <b>chlorofluoromethanes</b> that the application of bond additivity corrections (BAC’s) to the ab initio enthalpies effectively removes systematic errors in the calculations and yields values that are in close agreement with experimentally derived heats. The rms deviations of the corrected calculated enthalpies from the experimental values are 2. 4, 2. 6, 3. 4, 4. 7, and 3. 8 kJ/mol for the G 2 (MP 2), G 2, CBS-Q, CBS- 4, and BAC-MP 4 methods, respectively. These deviations are lower than the rms errors (6. 9 kJ/mol) in the experimental enthalpies. Therefore, it is concluded that any of these calculational procedures, together with bond additivity corrections to remove systematic error, may profitably be used to obtain accurate enthalpies of formation in chlorofluorocarbon species...|$|R
40|$|Rate {{coefficients}} and branching ratios {{have been}} measured for {{the reactions of}} O- and O 2 - with CCl 4, CCl 3 F, CCl 2 F 2, CClF 3, CF 4, CHCl 3, CH 2 Cl 2, and CH 3 Cl using a selected ioin flow tube at 300 K and 0. 6 Torr. Measured rate coefficients for all reactions (except for O- 2 /CClF 3 and O- 2 and O-/CF 4 which do not react) are at or close to the collisional rate. Where electron transfer is exoergic it is observed for the <b>chlorofluoromethanes</b> {{but not for the}} chloromethanes. It is suggested that nucleophilic attack of O- and O- 2 on both chlorine and carbon (in the case of the <b>chlorofluoromethanes)</b> and on chlorine, carbon and hydrogen (in the case of the chloromethanes) are required to produce the observed products. It is also suggested that, with the exception of methyl chloride, the halide ion, X- (X = Cl or F), is not formed directly, but by the decomposition of ClX- which is formed with excess vibrational energy. Following a discussion of the relevance of our results to the effects of oxygen doping upon the response of an electron capture detector (ECD) to halocarbon, it is concluded that the currently accepted mechanism to explain the observed increased sensitivity of the ECD is partially in error. © 1993...|$|R

40|$|The <b>chlorofluoromethane</b> {{problem and}} the SST problem {{have been subject to}} {{continuing}} evaluation by the use of one-dimensional stratospheric photochemistry models. The problems to some extent appear to be inversely related to one another through hydroxyl radical reactions; in other words, processes which tend {{to increase the amount of}} OH in a model tend to increase the sensitivity of the ozone column to ClX perturbations, while at the same time decreasing the sensitivity to NO(x) perturbations. Evaluations of sensitivity to ClX and NO(x) have varied as new input information has become available and modeling techniques have improved.

40|$|Recent {{measurements}} of key HO(x) reaction rates are presented which imply that OH concentrations at altitudes below 30 km {{are lower than}} those predicted by current photochemical models. The consequences of the lower OH abundances are examined with respect to calculated perturbations of ozone by added nitrogen oxides, chlorine, and water vapor. Consideration is also given to the perturbation of stratospheric ozone by continuing release of <b>chlorofluoromethanes</b> {{in light of the}} new HO(x) reaction rates. The ozone loss is found to be reduced by about 25 % compared with earlier estimates, mainly because the reduced OH abundance below 30 km slows the reaction between OH and HCl...|$|R

40|$|Measurements of the {{kinetics}} of {{the reaction}} of OH with HNO 3, and mechanisms of HNO 3 removal from the stratosphere, are reported. Bimolecular rate constants were determined at temperatures between 224 and 366 K by monitoring the concentrations of OH radicals produced by HNO 3 photolysis and HNO 3 according to their resonance fluorescence and 184. 9 -nm absorption, respectively. The rate constant measured at 298 K {{is found to be}} somewhat faster than previously accepted values, with a negative temperature dependence.

40|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} two specific ozone perturbation mechanisms are examined. The {{need to look}} back to predictions of the near past {{as well as the}} future as a means of testing model results is emphasized. The two perturbations examined are that due to <b>chlorofluoromethane</b> (CFM) release and that due to the air pollutants CO and nitrogen oxide. A steady-state model is used to investigate the characteristics of the stratospheric-tropospheric photochemical system for differing levels of CO and nitrogen oxide fluxes at the ground and for simultaneously changing the stratospheric from CFM release. Two basic scenarios chosen to illustrate the competing effects of the two types of perturbation use the time-dependence for chlorine radical buildup calculated for constant continued release of CFM's...|$|E
40|$|A good {{test of the}} {{transport}} and ultraviolet radiation treatment for any model can {{be based on the}} consideration of the three gases N 2 O, CFCl 3 (F- 11), and CF 2 Cl 2 (F- 12). Attention is given to a two-dimensional model which makes it possible to study changes in seasonal and latitudinal distributions which result from O 2 cross-section changes. A latitude-dependent ozone decrease has already been predicted by two-dimensional models for <b>chlorofluoromethane</b> (CFM) release. For this reason, it is of interest to determine if a strong latitude-dependent change is detectable in the CFM profiles. One-dimensional models have pointed toward a trend of decreased trace gas concentrations in correlation with decreased O 2 cross sections. The O 2 cross sections between 180 and 230 nm are changed within a range of experimentlly allowed values. It is found that lower O 2 absorption cross sections lead to larger photodissociation rates for the trace gases F- 11, F- 12, and N 2 O...|$|E

In this report we demonstrate an approach to estimating the increase in skin cancer incidence associated with increases in skin cancer incidence associated with increases in ultraviolet radiation. The purpose is to demonstrate the logic used and the assumptions that must be made when such estiamtes are made or cited. We emphasize that such estimates should be considered crude until the many assumptions can be investigated...|$|R
40|$|Polarization-dependent {{resonant}} inelastic {{x-ray scattering}} (RIXS) {{has been shown}} to be a probe of molecular-field effects on the electronic structure of isolated molecules. In this experimental analysis we explain the linear dichroism observed in Cl 2 p polarized RIXS following Cl 1 s excitation of a series of <b>chlorofluoromethanes</b> (CF 3 Cl, CF 2 Cl 2, CFCl 3, and CCl 4) as due to molecular-field effects, including singlet-triplet exchange.

40|$|Estimates {{are made}} {{of changes in the}} {{atmospheric}} climate due to the radiative effects of 10 ppb of <b>chlorofluoromethanes</b> (CFM's). The estimates are derived {{on the basis of a}} 12 -layer stratospheric general circulation model with a specified change of ocean temperature. Two tropical maxima in zonal average temperature change were observed: one in the upper troposphere and one centered at the tropopause. The temperature change exceeds the surface temperature change by a factor of at least two. If the 1975 CFM emission rate were to continue indefinitely, stratospheric water-vapor concentrations would increase by up to 60 % due to CFM radiative effects. This would reduce ozone concentrations by an additional 4 % of the natural ozone column...|$|R
