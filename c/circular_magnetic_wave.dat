40|$|The linear {{stability}} of a magnetized plasma accompanying temperature gradient was reexamined by using plasma kinetic theory. The anisotropic velocity distribution function was decomposed into two components. One {{is proportional to}} the temperature gradient parallel to and the other {{is proportional to the}} temperature gradient perpendicular to the back ground magnetic field. Since the amplitude of the anisotropic velocity distribution function is proportional to the heat conductivity and the heat conductivities perpendicular to the magnetic field is strongly reduced, the first component of the anisotropic velocity distribution function is predominant. The anisotropic velocity distribution function induced by the temperature gradient along the back ground magnetic field drives plasma kinetic instability and the <b>circular</b> polarized <b>magnetic</b> plasma <b>waves</b> are excited. The instability is almost identical to Weibel instability in weakly magnetized plasma. However, depending on whether wave vectors of modes are parallel to or antiparallel to the back ground magnetic field, the growth rate is suppressed or enhanced due to back ground magnetic field. In the strongly magnetized plasma, one mode is stabilized and only one of the modes remains unstable. The Jitter radiation spectrum formulae emitted by relativistic electrons when they travel through the magnetized plasma with the plasma waves driven by the instability, are deduced at the first time. The synchrotron emission and the Jitter radiation are simultaneously emitted from the same relativistic electron. The Jitter radiation is expected to be circularly polarized but with a very small polarization degree since almost the same amount of left and right handed <b>circular</b> polarized <b>magnetic</b> <b>waves</b> are excited by the instability.

The experiments have been carried out using the transverse magneto-optical Kerr effect in <b>circular</b> and axial <b>magnetic</b> field. The electric current flowing through two wires in opposite directions produced the <b>circular</b> <b>magnetic</b> field. The successive opposite jumps of circular magnetization appear as a result of mutual interaction of the microwires. A strong influence of the axial magnetic field on the circular bistability has been found.

In the case of propagating <b>magnetic</b> field <b>wave</b> (with specified amplitude, frequency and the wavelength), the low temperature dynamical mode is a propagating spin wave and the system becomes structureless or random in the high temperature. A dynamical symmetry breaking phase transition is observed at a finite (nonzero) temperature.

The dynamic nonequilibrium transition temperature was found to decrease as the amplitude of the propagating <b>magnetic</b> field <b>wave</b> increases.

40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{response of}} an Ising ferromagnet to a plane polarised standing <b>magnetic</b> field <b>wave</b> is modelled and studied here by Monte Carlo simulation in two dimensions. The amplitude of standing <b>magnetic</b> <b>wave</b> is modulated along the direction x. We have detected two main dynamical phases namely, pinned and oscillating spin clusters. Depending {{on the value}} of field amplitude the system is found to undergo a phase transition from oscillating spin cluster to pinned as the system is cooled down. The time averaged magnetisation over a full cycle of magnetic field oscillations is defined as the dynamic order parameter. The transition is detected by studying the temperature dependences of the variance of the dynamic order parameter, the derivative of the dynamic order parameter and the dynamic specific heat. The dependence of the transition temperature on the magnetic field amplitude and on the wavelength of the <b>magnetic</b> field <b>wave</b> is studied at a single frequency. A comprehensive phase boundary is drawn in the plane described by the temperature and field amplitude for two different wavelengths of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>wave.</b> The variation of instantaneous line magnetisation during a period of magnetic field oscillation for standing wave mode is compared to those for the propagating wave mode. Also the probability that a spin at any site, flips, is calculated.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} analysis of the time evolution of ground magnetic fluctuations in three (12 – 48 s, 24 – 96 s and 48 – 192 s) period bands during nightside auroral activations. We use an independently derived auroral activation list composed of both substorms and pseudo-breakups to provide {{an estimate of the}} activation times of nightside aurora during periods with comprehensive ground magnetometer coverage. One hundred eighty-one events in total are studied to demonstrate the statistical nature of the time evolution of <b>magnetic</b> <b>wave</b> power during the ∼ 30 min surrounding auroral activations. We find that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>wave</b> power is approximately constant before an auroral activation, starts to grow up to 90 s prior to the optical onset time, maximizes a few minutes after the auroral activation, then decays slightly to a new, and higher, constant level. Importantly, <b>magnetic</b> ULF <b>wave</b> power always remains elevated after an auroral activation, whether it is a substorm or a pseudo-breakup. We subsequently divide the auroral activation list into events that formed part of ongoing auroral activity and events that had little preceding geomagnetic activity. We find that the evolution of wave power in the ∼ 10 – 200 s period band essentially behaves in the same manner through auroral onset, regardless of event type. The absolute power across ULF wave bands, however, displays a power law-like dependency throughout a 30 min period centered on auroral onset time. We also find evidence of a secondary maximum in wave power at high latitudes ∼ 10 min following isolated substorm activations. Most significantly, we demonstrate that <b>magnetic</b> <b>wave</b> power levels persist after auroral activations for ∼ 10 min, which is consistent with recent findings of wave-driven auroral precipitation during substorms. This suggests that <b>magnetic</b> <b>wave</b> power and auroral particle precipitation are intimately linked and key components of the substorm onset process...|$|R
