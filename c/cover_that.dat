5|$|The {{cover was}} created by graphic artist Margo Nahas. It was not {{specifically}} commissioned; Nahas {{had been asked to}} create a <b>cover</b> <b>that</b> featured four chrome women dancing, but declined due to the creative difficulties. Her husband brought her portfolio to the band anyway, and from that material they chose the painting of a putto stealing cigarettes that was used. The model was Carter Helm, who was the child of one of Nahas' best friends, whom she photographed holding a candy cigarette.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} World War I, six guns in BSG mounts {{equipped}} Battery Friedrich August on {{the island}} of Wangerooge. Three of these were transferred to Helgoland after 1935 when Hitler renounced the Treaty of Versailles which had demilitarized the island. By 1938, they equipped Battery von Schröder and were manned by troops of the Second Naval Artillery Battalion (II. Marine-Artillerie-Abteilung), later 122nd Naval Artillery Battalion (122. Marine-Artillerie-Abteilung). After the French were defeated in 1940 all three guns were transferred to Le Trésorerie, near Boulogne-sur-Mer, France where they assumed their former name of Battery Friedrich August. These guns were initially in open barbettes with 360° traverse, but these were later rebuilt into concrete casemates with overhead <b>cover.</b> <b>that</b> could elevate to 50degrees and train 220degrees in either direction.|$|E
5|$|Colbert wrote The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter while {{teaching}} {{a seminar on}} self-publishing to graduate students at the University of North Carolina. He had it self-published in March 2001 and hired a company {{to take care of}} accounting, marketing, promotion, and selling. Colbert has never met Rowling and the book has not been approved by her or Warner Brothers (the owner of the film rights to the Harry Potter novels). He was given permission to publish it as long as he noted on the <b>cover</b> <b>that</b> it had not been approved by Rowling.|$|E
5|$|In Akagi predecessor, Hōshō, the hot {{exhaust gases}} vented by {{swivelling}} funnels posed {{a danger to}} the ship, and wind-tunnel testing had not suggested any solutions. Akagi and Kaga were given different solutions to evaluate in real-world conditions. Akagi was given two funnels on the starboard side. The larger, forward funnel was angled 30° below horizontal with its mouth facing the sea, and the smaller one exhausted vertically a little past the edge of the flight deck. The forward funnel was fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot exhaust gases and a <b>cover</b> <b>that</b> could be raised to allow the exhaust gases to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea. Kaga adopted a version of this configuration when she was modernized during the mid-1930s.|$|E

5|$|Regardless, on 1 April, Operation Pegasus began. Opposition {{from the}} North Vietnamese was {{light and the}} primary problem that {{hampered}} the advance was continual heavy morning cloud <b>cover</b> <b>that</b> slowed the pace of helicopter operations. As the relief force made progress, the Marines at Khe Sanh moved out from their positions and began patrolling at greater distances from the base.

5|$|During World War II Fleming had {{mentioned}} to friends {{that he wanted}} to write a spy novel, {{but it was not until}} 17 February 1952 that he began to write his first novel, Casino Royale. He started writing his book at his Jamaican home Goldeneye, typing out 2,000 words in the morning, directly from his own experiences and imagination; he finished work on the manuscript in just over two months, completing it on 18 March 1952. Publishers Jonathan Cape were initially reluctant to publish the book, but were persuaded by Fleming's brother Peter (1907–1971), who had previously published material through them. On 13 April 1953 Casino Royale was released in the UK in hardcover, priced at 10s, 6d, with a <b>cover</b> <b>that</b> had been devised by Fleming himself. The first edition of 4,728 copies of Casino Royale sold out in less than a month; a second print run the same month also sold out, as did a third run of more than 8,000 books published in May 1954. At the time, Fleming was the Foreign Manager for Kemsley Newspapers, an organisation which owned The Sunday Times. Upon accepting the job, Fleming requested that he be allowed three months holiday per year, which allowed him the freedom to write.|$|E
5|$|Eventually she {{expanded}} beyond make-up artistry to {{body painting}} {{to express her}} own artistic vision. In August 1991, Demi Moore caused international artistic commotion by appearing {{on the cover of}} Vanity Fair seven months pregnant with her daughter Scout LaRue in the photo More Demi Moore, with Gair as the make-up artist and Annie Leibovitz as the photographer. Exactly one year later, she returned to the cover of the same magazine nude as a product of Gair and Leibovitz in a nearly equally as shocking body painting, Demi's Birthday Suit (pictured right). Gair was the primary body painter of this art and the magazine cover art propelled Gair to fame. Fifteen years later, it continues to be considered the most well-known example of modern body painting. The 1992 <b>cover</b> <b>that</b> entailed a thirteen-hour sitting for Gair and her team of make-up artists was a commemoration of the August 1991 photo. The shooting was storied because photographer Annie Leibovitz could not decide where to shoot and reserved two mobile homes, four hotel rooms and five houses. The pop culture attention given to Gair and her body painting led Absolut Vodka to consider an Absolut Gair body painting promotion in 1993.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{comes from}} frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring {{long periods of}} precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures. Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool. Occasionally, warm air masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. These warm air masses can bring sunny weather, particularly during the afternoon when {{they come from the}} north or northwest {{as a result of a}} trough located in central Argentina. On the other hand, warm air masses from Brazil bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with high cloud <b>cover</b> <b>that</b> is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime air. These warm air masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the warmest air masses, leading to the warmest temperatures. Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in warm and tropical air from the north is weaker in winter due to lower insolation, leading to the winds from the north being less intense and shorter lived.|$|E
