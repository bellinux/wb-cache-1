40|$|Objectives: Complaints by {{patients}} and their relatives are {{an important source of}} information for service improvement. In order to take remedial measures, the present study evaluated the complaints of {{patients and their}} relatives about our emergency department (ED). Methods: Records of all patient complaints, from June 2008 to June 2012, were retrieved from the Quality Improvement Unit (QIU) archives. All complainants were contacted by phone. The socio-demographic profiles of complainants, their reasons for complaints, and the outcomes were analyzed using the SPSS statistical package. Results: The results revealed that 54 <b>complaints</b> have <b>been</b> made against our ED over four years relating to medical care, staff attitudes, waiting time, and financial reasons. Of the complainants, 75. 9 % were male (n= 41), and 24. 1 % (n= 13) were female. The majority (29. 7 %, 20. 4 %) of the <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> due to medical care and attitude problems. Most <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> made for green code patients (55. 6 %). The majority of <b>complaints</b> <b>were</b> about emergency physicians (38. 9 %). <b>Complaint</b> frequency <b>was</b> 0. 18 per 1. 000 visits. Conclusions: <b>Complaints</b> <b>are</b> potentially useful quality assurance tools, and can identify remediable system flaws. The main causes of <b>complaints</b> <b>are</b> medical care, staff attitude, and waiting time, and many of these causes are remediable...|$|R

5|$|Brooks was {{assigned}} three prominent Minstrel attorneys, {{and after a}} year of sitting on the docket, at about 11 AM on April 15, 1874, Baxter's demurrer to Brook's <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> suddenly called up. Neither of Baxter's lawyers were present in the court room, and the demurrer had been submitted without their knowledge. Without giving Baxter any time to testify, Judge Whytock overruled the demurrer and awarded Brooks $2,000 in damages and the office of Governor of Arkansas. Neither Brooks nor the court notified the legislature or Governor Baxter. Judge Wytock then swore in Joseph Brooks as the new governor of Arkansas, despite having no authority to do so.|$|E
5|$|Circuit Judge Jon I. Gordon {{dismissed}} the lawsuit without prejudice in November requesting the plaintiffs refile with a clarified complaint.

In response to a motion to dismiss filed by the parent company, the judge ruled in January 2009 in favor of Burger King. In his decision, Judge Gordon stated that the franchise contract clearly does provide Burger King the right to establish minimum hours standards for its franchises. After purchase of the company by 3G, Burger King conceded to the franchises request the mandate be changed to a recommendation and relaxed its position on the extended hours.|$|E

The Commission began an antitrust investigation in 2007 of Apple's business practices after the <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> made, but ultimately the Commission probe found no agreements between Apple and major record labels on how iTunes is run in Europe, only that Apple had been paying higher wholesale prices to UK music labels and was passing the cost along to UK customers.|$|E

5|$|In 2012 the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the UK banned some of Proactiv's {{advertising}} as misleading.

According to the ASA, the celebrities had signed statements saying they had used the UK version {{for a few weeks}} one to three years earlier, but the advertisements gave the appearance that they had continued to benefit from it, so the viewer's <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> upheld.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's works, {{especially}} his Lives of the Poets series, describe various features of excellent writing. He {{believed that the}} best poetry relied on contemporary language, and he disliked the use of decorative or purposefully archaic language. He was suspicious of the poetic language used by Milton, whose blank verse he believed would inspire many bad imitations. Also, Johnson opposed the poetic language of his contemporary Thomas Gray. His greatest <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> that obscure allusions found in works like Milton's Lycidas were overused; he preferred poetry that could be easily read and understood. In addition to his views on language, Johnson believed that a good poem incorporated new and unique imagery.|$|E

5|$|A {{controversy}} over the effects of running blade length arose at the 2012 Paralympic Games, as Brazilian runner Alan Oliveira and USA runner Blake Leeper changed to longer running blades {{within a few months}} before the 2012 Paralympic Games. This led to marked improvement in their running times. Pistorius complained after the 200m race that the blades provided artificially lengthened running strides, which would be an infringement of the IPC rules, regardless of that the blades were within the allowable height limits for the athletes concerned. His <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> supported by single-leg runners including Jerome Singleton and Jack Swift, who called for the T43 double blade and T44 single blade classes to be separated in future events, as single blade runners were unable to adjust the height of the prostheses, and must always match the length of their biological leg with a running blade.|$|E
5|$|Beiderbecke {{attended}} Davenport High School from 1919 to 1921. During this time, {{he sat in}} {{and played}} professionally with various bands, including those of Wilbur Hatch, Floyd Bean and Carlisle Evans. In the spring of 1920 he performed for the school's Vaudeville Night, singing in a vocal quintet called the Black Jazz Babies and playing his horn. He also performed, {{at the invitation of}} his friend Fritz Putzier, in Neal Buckley's Novelty Orchestra. The group was hired for a gig in December 1920, but a <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> lodged with the American Federation of Musicians, Local 67, that the boys did not have union cards. In an audition before a union executive, Beiderbecke was forced to sight read and failed. He did not earn his card.|$|E
5|$|Chesney was {{a builder}} in his diocese, where {{he ordered the}} {{construction}} of the episcopal palace. He also founded a Gilbertine house of canons just outside the city of Lincoln, the priory of St Catherine, shortly after the order was recognised by the papacy in 1148. Unusually for its time it was only founded for men, although Gilbertine monastic houses typically accommodated both men and women. In 1161 he bought the Old Temple in London as a house for himself. These expenditures contributed to his financial difficulties, along with royal demands, which led to complaints about Chesney's spending. Another cause for <b>complaint</b> <b>was</b> that he gave away some of his estates as marriage portions for his nieces. Chesney also was a benefactor to the town of Banbury, to which he granted the right to hold a fair some time before 1154.|$|E
