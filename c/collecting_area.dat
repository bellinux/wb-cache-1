25|$|Rocket mail is the {{delivery}} of mail by rocket or missile and is a specialised <b>collecting</b> <b>area</b> of aerophilately called Astrophilately. One of the early famous rocketeers was Stephen Smith, a Secretary of the Indian Airmail Society, who launched 270 rockets between 1934 and 1944 of which 80 contained mail. Other topics for consideration are: USPS rocket mail from 1936 or 1959 launches, Russian submarine-launched rocket mail, or reusable launch vehicle mail.|$|E
2500|$|The {{telescope}} has {{an expected}} mass {{about half of}} Hubble Space Telescope's, but its primary mirror (a 6.5 meter diameter gold-coated beryllium reflector) will have a <b>collecting</b> <b>area</b> about five times as large ( [...] vs. [...] ). The JWST is oriented toward near-infrared astronomy, but can also see orange and red visible light, {{as well as the}} mid-infrared region, depending on the instrument. The design emphasizes the near to mid-infrared for three main reasons: High-redshift objects have their visible emissions shifted into the infrared, cold objects such as debris disks and planets emit most strongly in the infrared, and this band is difficult to study from the ground or by existing space telescopes such as Hubble.|$|E

2500|$|JWST's {{primary mirror}} is a 6.5-meter-diameter {{gold-coated}} beryllium reflector with a <b>collecting</b> <b>area</b> of 25m2. [...] This {{is too large}} for existing launch vehicles, so the mirror is composed of 18 hexagonal segments, which will unfold after the telescope is launched. Image plane wavefront sensing through phase retrieval {{will be used to}} position the mirror segments in the correct location using very precise micro-motors. [...] Subsequent to this initial configuration they will only need occasional updates every few days to retain optimal focus. This is unlike terrestrial telescopes like the Keck which continually adjust their mirror segments using active optics to overcome the effects of gravitational and wind loading, and is made possible {{because of the lack of}} environmental disturbances of a telescope in space.|$|E
2500|$|Several other minor {{refinements}} {{were made}} to stethoscopes until, in the early 1960s, David Littmann, a Harvard Medical School professor, created a new stethoscope that was lighter than previous models and had improved acoustics. In the late 1970s, 3M-Littmann introduced the tunable diaphragm: a very hard (G-10) glass-epoxy resin diaphragm member with an overmolded silicone flexible acoustic surround which permitted increased excursion of the diaphragm member in a Z-axis {{with respect to the}} plane of the sound <b>collecting</b> <b>area.</b> The left shift to a lower resonant frequency increases the volume of some low frequency sounds due to the longer waves propagated by the increased excursion of the hard diaphragm member suspended in the concentric accountic surround. Conversely, restricting excursion of the diaphragm by pressing the stethoscope diaphragm surface firmly against the anatomical area overlying the physiological sounds of interest, the acoustic surround could also be used to dampen excursion of the diaphragm in response to [...] "z"-axis pressure against a concentric fret. This raises the frequency bias by shortening the wavelength to auscultate a higher range of physiological sounds.|$|E
2500|$|The Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter (VBSDC), {{built by}} {{students}} at the University of Colorado Boulder, is operating continuously to make dust measurements. It consists of a detector panel, about , mounted on the anti-solar face of the spacecraft (the ram direction), and an electronics box within the spacecraft. The detector contains fourteen polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) panels, twelve science and two reference, which generate voltage when impacted. Effective <b>collecting</b> <b>area</b> is [...] No dust counter has operated past the orbit of Uranus; models of dust in the outer Solar System, especially the Kuiper belt, are speculative. The VBSDC is always turned on measuring the masses of the interplanetary and interstellar dust particles (in the range of nano- and picograms) as they collide with the PVDF panels mounted on the New Horizons spacecraft. The measured data is expected to greatly contribute {{to the understanding of}} the dust spectra of the Solar System. The dust spectra can then be compared with those from observations of other stars, giving new clues as to where Earth-like planets can be found in the universe.

40|$|Special {{collections}} librarians {{at small}} or medium sized institutions may lack the resources required {{to build new}} <b>collecting</b> <b>areas</b> or further enrich the <b>collecting</b> <b>areas</b> mandated by their mission. As one measure to overcome this challenge at Pepperdine University, we are experimenting with an approach that we call “digital surrogate” donations. In these cases, we work with donors to create digital surrogates—typically scans of images or texts—of select physical materials with which donors are not quite ready to part. Per a modified donor agreement, the digital surrogate collections are then made available to researchers through our digital archive and open access digital collections. This technique has proved successful in expanding both our Malibu history and film and television <b>collecting</b> <b>areas,</b> as these digital surrogates serve to attract other (physical) donations to our archives. We also {{see this as a}} step in building donor relations as we make explicit the hope that the donor will eventually give us the physical originals as well. This Pecha Kucha talk will demonstrate these benefits, but also address the risks and unknowns inherent to digital surrogate projects. For example, what intellectual property issues are raised when rights to an object in its digital form are separated from rights to an object in its physical form? How do we as an institution monitor the chain of custody of a digital surrogate collection’s original, physical source? And ultimately as research continually shifts to an online environment, will the benefits of digital surrogate collections outweigh any threats they pose to the orthodoxy of archives and manuscripts best practices? * Note: script of talk is included in the Notes section of each slide...|$|R
