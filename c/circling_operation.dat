This yields a positive answer to a question raised by S.  Jennings and repeated later by A. Krasil'nikov. Furthermore, for a ring R with unity whose multiplicative group R∗ is metabelian, it is shown that R is Lie metabelian, provided that R is generated by R∗ and R modulo its Jacobson radical is commutative and artinian. This implies that a local ring is Lie metabelian if and only if its multiplicative group is metabelian...|$|R
40|$|Greither and Pareigis have {{established}} a connection between Hopf Galois structures on a Galois extension $L/K$ with Galois group $G$, and the regular subgroups {{of the group of}} permutations on $G$, which are normalized by $G$. Byott has rephrased this connection in terms of certain equivalence classes of injective morphisms of $G$ into the holomorph of the groups $N$ with the same cardinality of $G$. Childs and Corradino have used this theory to construct such Hopf Galois structures, starting from fixed-point-free endomorphisms of $G$ that have abelian images. In this paper we show that a fixed-point-free endomorphism has an abelian image if and only if there is another endomorphism that is its inverse with respect to the <b>circle</b> <b>operation</b> in the near-ring of maps on $G$, and give a fairly explicit recipe for constructing all such endomorphisms.

40|$|A new machine {{system has}} been designed, {{developed}} and evaluated for extensive circle spraying of oil palms (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) {{in an effort to}} overcome the inefficient spraying problem with the conventional spraying system. The machine system consists of a four-wheeled drive 4 WD prime mover with front mounted machine attachments for the <b>circle</b> spraying <b>operation.</b> The configuration of the circle spraying attachment consists of a hexagonal curved spray boom, lifting arm, opening-tilting mechanism unit, storage tank, spray pump, solid cone nozzles, and associate hydraulic system. Field performance tests on the machine system showed an average effective field capacity of 7. 89 ha per man per day and when compared to the earlier reported effective field capacity of the walking spray-operated equipment using Serena LT 16 knapsack sprayer; a difference of 1. 97 time for circle spraying of mature palms grove. Reduction in the human energy expenditure of 101. 28 kJ man- 1 h- 1 or 10. 68 % but an increase in the spraying cost of 1. 53 USD ha- 1 or 24. 9 % were obtained with the machine system against the walking spraying-operated equipment using Serena LT 16 knapsack sprayer. Justification for machine system to be cost effective could be satisfied if the present effective field capacity is increased to 1. 263 time with good skilled operator or if the current R&D cost is reduced to 0. 41 time. This is because the improved field capacity of new machine system could not rationalize its current R&D cost.

40|$|The Flying Fish {{unmanned}} aerial {{system is}} designed to perform persistent surveillance on the open ocean by gathering data as a drifting surface buoy and periodically repositioning via self-initiated flight. The robust stable airframe supports an avionics package with inertial navigation, pressure, and ultrasonic range sensors interfaced with an embedded Linux computer and extended-range modem to a ground station. Flying Fish maintains a preset watch area, defined by center coordinates and a radius, through autonomous flight/drift cycles. This paper describes the multi-mode guidance logic and gain-scheduled control system that enables fully-autonomous operations. The mode-switching logic relies on geometric and temporal rules to select the appropriate flight mode, and intercept-guidance to ensure the aircraft properly flies across its watch circle.

500|$|The Coalition also {{pursued a}} {{different}} operational plan. The Coalition's operational strategy brought its different forces {{closer and closer}} together in concentric circles, to a single point in Saxony. Known as the Trachenberg Plan, the Sixth Coalition's operating plan established clear, concise and specific guidelines for commanders, from the Army through the basic company level: act offensively against an inferior foe; act defensively against a superior foe, underscoring to commanders at all levels the risk of underestimating the threat of Napoleon and his army. The new plan divided the Allied force into three armies: Silesia, Bohemia, and Northern Germany. The Silesian army, composed of Prussians and Russians, left 50,000 men in the Province of Silesia and moved the remaining 100,000 to join with 120,000 Austrians in Saxony. [...] The Crown Prince of Sweden, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, a former Marshal of France and a favorite of Napoleon's, established an army of observation at Hamburg and Lübeck, and another 70,000 concentrated [...] southwest of Berlin. Using this plan, the Coalition pushed Napoleon and his allies into an increasingly smaller <b>circle</b> of <b>operation.</b> In theory, while this concentrated Napoleon's force, it also limited his maneuvering options.
