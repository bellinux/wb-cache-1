40|$|High density {{concrete}} {{is widely}} used in railway, <b>crane</b> <b>counterweight,</b> radiation shielding in nuclear plants or other radiation related application in medical establishment. The {{aim of this study}} is to increase the density of concrete and accomplish it by using steel treatment waste as aggregates- iron dross (mainly iron oxides) and steel punchings which are locally available. Two different mixes with the same w/c ratio and cement content were designed by using fine grinded iron dross and a mix of steel punchings with sizes less than 11. 2 mm as aggregates. The traditional concrete aggregates were replaced by steel treatment waste in the amount of 50 % and 100 %. Physical and mechanical properties (density, compressive and tensile strength, freeze-thaw resistance and others) were determined for obtained concrete. The concrete with density up to 4640 kg/m 3 was obtained in this stud...|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} are {{proposed}} some mechanical systems, all certainly {{used in the}} Classic Age, that could be easily adopted to power the siege towers, devices invented by Greek engineers and called Helepolis. These ancient motors are made up by capstans, tread wheels like those used for Greek-Roman <b>cranes</b> and <b>counterweight</b> motors, all installed into the helepolis. The proposed motors are also analyzed from a mechanical {{point of view in}} order to examine, at least theoretically, their effectiveness in such applications...|$|R
40|$|Cranes {{are often}} the most {{conspicuous}} machines on a construction site. This is due to their large size, {{in addition to the}} important role they have in transporting heavy payloads vertically and horizontally. There are two major families of construction cranes: tower cranes and mobile cranes. Mobile cranes that are mounted on tracks are a subgroup referred to as ``crawler cranes''. Crawler cranes are widely used on construction sites, and are a backbone of the United States construction industry, thus a detailed study of these cranes' behavior is essential. This research studies the tip-over stability of crawler cranes in heavy-lifting applications. Two major applications are discussed: crawler <b>cranes</b> using movable <b>counterweights</b> and crawler <b>cranes</b> in tandem lifting. M. S...|$|R
