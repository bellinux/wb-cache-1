5|$|Conductive CVD diamond is {{a useful}} {{electrode}} under many circumstances. Photochemical methods {{have been developed for}} covalently linking DNA to the surface of polycrystalline diamond films produced through CVD. Such DNA modified films <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> for detecting various biomolecules, which would interact with DNA thereby changing electrical conductivity of the diamond film. In addition, diamonds <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to detect redox reactions that cannot ordinarily be studied and in some cases degrade redox-reactive organic contaminants in water supplies. Because diamond is mechanically and chemically stable, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> as an electrode under conditions that would destroy traditional materials. As an electrode, synthetic diamond <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> in waste water treatment of organic effluents and the production of strong oxidants.|$|E
