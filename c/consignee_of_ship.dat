5000|$|Golden Fleece was a 968-ton clipper. It was wrecked on April 22, 1854, {{as it was}} exiting Golden Gate on {{a voyage}} way to Manilla. The wreck {{occurred}} at the rocks near Fort Point. The Daily Alta California wrote that [...] "lying broadside OR to the rocks... bilged and full of water, her mainmast is gone, also the fore and main top mast". On April 22, 1854, the wreck was sold in a public auction and [...] "The purchasers of the wreck are busily engaged stripping her of everything moveable, {{at the same time}} preparations are being made to raise her... The sails, rigging, guns, &C., saved by the <b>consignee</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship,</b> were sold at auction yesterday, the two brass pieces bringing $580".|$|R

50|$|Merchandise often {{sold through}} {{consignment}} shops includes antiques, athletic equipment, automobiles, books, clothing (especially children's, maternity, and wedding clothing, {{which are often}} not worn out), furniture, firearms, music, musical instruments, tools, paragliders and toys. eBay, drop-off stores and online sellers often use the consignment model of selling. Art galleries, as well, often operate as <b>consignees</b> <b>of</b> the artist.|$|R
50|$|The Anthony Gibbs and Sons, {{represented}} in South America by (Williams or) Guillermo Gibbs & Cia. of Valparaiso, {{had much more}} important investments in Peru than in Chile. In Peru, the House of Gibbs owned of 58% of the Compañía de Salitres de Tarapacá ("Tarapaca Nitrate Company") and had been guano <b>consignee</b> <b>of</b> the government in Europe.|$|R
50|$|It {{permits the}} Secretary {{to require the}} owner or <b>consignee</b> <b>of</b> food refused {{admission}} into the United States, but not ordered destroyed, to affix to the container of the food a label that clearly and conspicuously bears the statement: UNITED STATES: REFUSED ENTRY, and it prohibits an importer from port shopping with respect to food that has previously been denied entry.|$|R
50|$|The flyer {{also warned}} river pilots {{that they would}} receive the same {{treatment}} if they tried {{to bring in the}} Polly. (Another such broadside specifically warning river pilots was later issued on December 7.) <b>Consignees</b> <b>of</b> the tea would also suffer dire consequences if they accepted shipment. Captain Ayres was ushered to the Arch Street Wharf and from there returned to his ship. He then refitted the Polly with food and water and sailed it back to Britain, still laden with its cargo of tea.|$|R
5000|$|The Uniform Bills of Lading Act {{was adopted}} in 1909 and {{passed by the}} US Uniform Law Commission. The act {{addressed}} the judicial and legislative treatment of {{issues such as the}} extent of the carrier's liability to the <b>consignee</b> <b>of</b> the goods or to the buyer of the bill of lading based upon the carrier's issuance of the bill. [...] It governed the relationship between persons with interest in the goods, and carriers who transported those goods. It set described how a carrier could limit its liability.|$|R

6000|$|LATER.--After lunch Harker and {{his wife}} {{went back to their}} own room, and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They are hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are {{knitting}} together in chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got the letters between the <b>consignee</b> <b>of</b> the boxes at Whitby and the carriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife's transcript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here it is [...] .|$|R
60|$|Randolph, who {{had already}} determined, as a forlorn hope, to write a {{cautious}} letter to the captain (informing him briefly of the news without betraying his secret, and directed to the care <b>of</b> the <b>consignees</b> <b>of</b> the Dom Pedro in Brazil, by the next post), {{was glad to be}} able to add this medical opinion to relieve his patron's mind of any fear of having hastened his brother's death by his innocent appearance. But here the entrance of Sibyl Eversleigh with her friends drove all else from his mind.|$|R
60|$|We reached Bordeaux {{without any}} further accident, or delay. I {{discharged}} {{in the usual}} way, and began to look about me, for another freight. It had been my intention to return to New York, {{and to keep the}} festivities of attaining my majority, at Clawbonny; but, I confess the discourse of these eternal gossips, the Brighams, had greatly lessened the desire to see home again, so soon. A freight for New York was offered me, but I postponed an answer, until it was given to another ship. At length an offer was made me to go to Cronstadt, in Russia, with a cargo of wines and brandies, and I accepted it. The great and better informed merchants, as it would seem, distrusted the continuance of the hollow peace that then existed, and a company of them thought it might be well to transfer their liquors to the capital of the czar, in readiness for contingencies. An American ship was preferred, on account of her greater speed, as well as on account of her probable neutral character, in the event of troubles occurring at any unlooked-for moment. The Dawn took in her wines and brandies accordingly, and sailed for the Baltic about the last of August. She had a long, but a safe passage, delivering the freight according to the charter-party, in good condition. While at Cronstadt, the American consul, and the <b>consignees</b> <b>of</b> an American <b>ship</b> that had lost her master and chief-mate by the smallpox, applied to me to let Marble carry the vessel home. I pressed the offer on my old friend, but he obstinately refused {{to have anything to do}} with the vessel. I then recommended Talcott, and after some negotiation, the latter took charge of the Hyperion. I was sorry to part with my mate, to whom I had become strongly attached; but the preferment was so clearly to his advantage, that I could take no other course. The vessel being ready, she sailed the day after Talcott joined her; and, sorry am I to be compelled to add, that she was never heard of, after clearing the Cattegat. The equinox of that season was tremendously severe, and it caused the loss of many vessels; that of the Hyperion doubtless among the rest.|$|R
50|$|After {{a recall}} is issued, FSIS conducts {{effectiveness}} checks {{to ensure that}} the company’s customers (or consignees) have received notice of the recall and are making every effort to retrieve and destroy the recalled product or return it to the recalling firm. FSIS personnel verify that the recalling firm has been diligent and successful in notifying and advising their <b>consignees</b> <b>of</b> the need to retrieve and control recalled product, and that the consignees have responded accordingly. FSIS has formal agreements with many state governments that allow those states to participate in effectiveness checks, thus improving the speed and effectiveness of recalls.|$|R
50|$|Dewey's {{ships were}} {{scattered}} {{up and down}} the Asiatic coast; {{but by the end of}} March the whole squadron, except the antiquated wooden Monocacy, had been gathered in the port of Hong Kong, their coal and stores replenished. Then came a period of waiting; the commodore was constantly making ready. First he sent the fleet paymaster over to the <b>consignees</b> <b>of</b> the English steamship Nanshan, and bought her as she was, with 3,300 tons of coal on board. Then he bought Zafiro, a steamship of the Manila-Hong Kong line, just as she was, with all her fuel and provisions, and on her was placed all the spare ammunition, so that she became the magazine of the fleet.|$|R
5000|$|The Bill of Lading designates that {{a carrier}} shall assume all risk of loss, damage, delay and {{liability}} in the transportation of any goods for shippers {{from the time}} of carrier's receipt of such goods and from a shipper until proper delivery has been made. Carriers are responsible for full actual loss. If the <b>consignee</b> <b>of</b> goods finds the freight damaged or unacceptable the bill of lading also serves as a legal instrument to dispute the delivery of goods in accordance to the provisions of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations Section 1005, Section 14706 (the Carmack Amendment), [...] and applicable state law to rectify any losses that happened due to the carrier.|$|R

50|$|A {{consignor}} who consigns {{goods to}} a consignee transfers only possession, not ownership, {{of the goods}} to the consignee. The consignor retains title to the goods. The <b>consignee</b> takes possession <b>of</b> the goods subject to a trust. If the consignee converts the goods to a use not contemplated in the consignment agreement, such as by selling them and keeping the {{proceeds of the sale}} for the <b>consignee,</b> the crime <b>of</b> embezzlement has been committed.|$|R
50|$|In every colony except Massachusetts, {{protesters were}} able to force the tea consignees to resign or to return the tea to England. In Boston, however, Governor Hutchinson was {{determined}} to hold his ground. He convinced the tea <b>consignees,</b> two <b>of</b> whom were his sons, not to back down.|$|R
50|$|Irla {{gradually}} {{made his}} way into the world of business and politics. With his brothers, he began industrial and commercial activities from Sant Feliu de Guíxols. He created the company Josep Irla & Co. using the capital of the three brothers. From this base, they opened a factory of cork stoppers that was extended over the years. They were <b>consignees</b> <b>of</b> boats and owned a schooner, with which they traded in wine and cork with Barcelona, acting as customs agents.In 1902, Irla married Florence Bas and Parent, also of Sant Feliu de Guixols and descendant of a family of workers. The couple had no children, but if they had two godchildren, Incarnation, daughter of peasants from a farm from Romanyà de la Selva, and Lola Aimerich, a cousin who was orphaned.|$|R

50|$|In the {{carriage}} of goods by sea, air or land, goods may be lost, damaged or deteriorated. The bill of lading (transport document used almost exclusively for {{carriage of goods}} by sea) is a contract of carriage between the consignor, the carrier and consignee that acts as a receipt of transfer of goods and as a negotiable instrument. The bill of lading also determines rights and liabilities agreed between parties to an international sale contract. Also reservations as to {{the quality and quantity of}} the goods are marked on the bill when accepting goods so as to stifle any accusations from the <b>consignee</b> <b>of</b> damage in transit. The consignor retains ownership of the goods until the bill of lading is transferred to the <b>consignee.</b> Most bills <b>of</b> lading today are governed by international conventions such as the Hague Rules (International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills of Lading); Hague-Visby Rules, which is a revised version of the Hague Rules by a Brussels Protocol in 1968; and Hamburg Rules. These rules impose minimum responsibilities and liabilities that cannot be softened by contract. On the other hand, the United States and the United Kingdom adopted the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA).|$|R
50|$|After the review, the {{consignee}} {{will return}} those items deemed unsuitable for resale to the consignor (such as torn or dirty items or items {{deemed to be}} fakes, which cannot be sold in some jurisdictions), accept those to be resold, and establish the target resale price, the <b>consignee's</b> share <b>of</b> it, {{and the length of}} time the items will be held for sale.|$|R
40|$|This work {{analyzes}} {{the use of}} the train by the Galician companies when they do business transactions with northern Portuguese operators. The residual usage of this infrastructure (0. 01 of all the transactions) is proved opposite the masive use of the truck; factors that explain the choice and the possible truck-versus-train replacement are established. The statistical study includes representative industrial companies and the main <b>consignees</b> <b>of</b> regular lines in the port of Vigo as spectrum. A formative explained structural equation model and a linear regression of the modal choice and its effect on the referred replacement are suggested. As conclusion, the need of improvement of the infrastructures in the connection mentioned above is assessed by companies and logistic operators (these last ones are more interested in changing) although the real liberalization of the rail operators market is a priority as without this, the improvement mentioned above would not affect the modal choice significantly...|$|R
5000|$|Azgapet is {{a leader}} of a tribe or clan in ancient and medieval Armenia, similar to chieftain. The term {{originates}} from the words azg (Armenian: ազգ), which means extended family or clan, and pet, which means chief. [...] The term azgapet {{had been used in}} addition to other similar terms for tribal collectivities, such as tanuter (Armenian: տանուտեր) and nahapet (Armenian: նահապետ). Patriarch Hayk, the legendary and eponymous progenitor of the Armenian people, is sometimes referred to as azgapet. One prominent medieval work where Armenian azgapets were mentioned include The History of the Province of Aghvank by Movses Kaghankatvatsi. The author of the “History..” mentions several dignitaries, including azgapets, who signed the Constitution of Aghven, a 5th-century legal document commissioned by King Vachagan II the Pious of Aghvank. One family with origins in the village of Syghnakh in the Nagorno Karabakh Republic claims descent from azgapet Marut, a chieftain from Varanda Valley and a <b>consignee</b> <b>of</b> the Constitution.|$|R

60|$|After {{being about}} three weeks in the Ardent, we eight prisoners were sent on board the Ramilies, to be tried as Englishmen who had been {{fighting}} against their king. The trial took place on board the Asia, 74, a flag-ship; but {{we lived in the}} Ramilies, during the time the investigation was going on. Sir Thomas Hardy held several conversations with me, on the quarter-deck, in which he manifested great kindness of feeling. He inquired whether I was really an American; but I evaded any direct answer. I told him, however, that I had been an apprentice, in New York, in the employment of Jacob Barker; which was true, in one sense, as Mr. Barker was the <b>consignee</b> <b>of</b> the Sterling, and knew of my indentures. I mentioned him, as a person more likely to be known than Captain Johnston. Sir Thomas said he had some knowledge of Mr. Barker; and, I think, I have heard that they were, in some way, connected. This was laying an anchor to-windward, as it turned out, in the end.|$|R
