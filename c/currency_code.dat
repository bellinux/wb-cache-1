5|$|Today, silver bullion has the ISO 4217 <b>currency</b> <b>code</b> XAG, one of {{only four}} {{precious}} metals to have one (the others being palladium, platinum, and gold). Silver coins are produced from cast rods or ingots, rolled to the correct thickness, heat-treated, and then used to cut blanks from. These blanks are then milled and minted in a coining press; modern coining presses can produce 8000 silver coins per hour.|$|E
5|$|Platinum is a {{precious}} metal commodity; its bullion has the ISO <b>currency</b> <b>code</b> of XPT. Coins, bars, and ingots are traded or collected. Platinum finds use in jewellery, usually as a 90–95% alloy, {{due to its}} inertness. It is {{used for this purpose}} for its prestige and inherent bullion value. Jewellery trade publications advise jewellers to present minute surface scratches (which they term patina) as a desirable feature in attempt to enhance value of platinum products.|$|E

The {{table below shows}} the ISO <b>currency</b> <b>codes</b> of former <b>currencies</b> and their common names (which do not always match the ISO 4217 names).

25|$|On 2 February 2009, the RBZ {{announced}} that a further 12 zeros were to {{be taken off the}} currency, with 1,000,000,000,000 third Zimbabwe dollars being exchanged for 1 new fourth dollar. New banknotes were introduced with face values of Z$1, Z$5, Z$10, Z$20, Z$50, Z$100 and Z$500. The banknotes of the fourth dollar circulated alongside the third dollar, which remained legal tender until 30 June 2009. The new ISO <b>currency</b> <b>code</b> was ZWL.|$|E
25|$|On 30 July 2008, {{the dollar}} was redenominated. After 1 August 2008, ZW$10 billion were worth ZW$1. The new <b>currency</b> <b>code</b> was ZWR. The {{denominations}} {{to be issued}} were coins valued Z$5, Z$10 and Z$25, and banknotes worth Z$5, Z$10, Z$20, Z$100, and Z$500. Due to frequent cash shortages and the apparently worthless Zimbabwean dollar, foreign currency was effectively legalised as a de facto currency on 13 September 2008 via a special program. This program officially allowed a number of retailers to accept foreign money. This reflected {{the reality of the}} dollarisation of the economy, with many shop keepers refusing to accept Zimbabwe dollars and requesting US dollars or South African rand instead. Despite redenomination, the RBZ was forced to print banknotes of ever higher values to keep up with surging inflation, with ten zeros reappearing by the end of 2008.|$|E
25|$|The in-game {{economy in}} Eve Online {{is an open}} economy that is largely player-driven. Non-player {{character}} (NPC) merchants sell skill books used by players to learn new skills and blueprints to manufacture ships and modules. NPC merchants also buy and sell Trade Goods.

The characters themselves gather the necessary raw materials to manufacture {{almost all of the}} ships and ship modules in the game. NPC ships can be looted and salvaged for items and materials. Non-player created ships and equipment may be purchased from various NPC factions as a character gains status with them, and can be resold in the in-game economy.

It was divided into 100 centų (genitive case; singular centas, nominative plural centai). The litas was first introduced on 2 October 1922 after World War I, when Lithuania declared independence and was reintroduced on 25 June 1993, following a period of currency exchange from the ruble to the litas with the temporary talonas then in place. The name was modeled after the name of the country (similar to Latvia and its lats). From 1994 to 2002, the litas was pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of 4 to 1. The litas was pegged to the euro at the rate of 3.4528 to 1 since 2002. The euro was expected to replace the litas by January 1, 2007, but persistent high inflation and the economic crisis delayed the switch. On 1 January 2015 the litas was switched to the euro at the rate of 3.4528 to 1.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2005, {{the head}} of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Dr. Gideon Gono, {{announced}} that Zimbabwe would have a new currency the following year, and new banknotes and coins would be produced. However, in June 2006, it was decreed that, for a new currency to be viable, Zimbabwe had to first achieve macro-economic stability (i.e., double digit inflation). Instead, in August 2006, the first dollar was redenominated to the second dollar at the rate of 1000 first dollars to 1 second dollar (1000:1). At the same time, the currency was devalued against the US dollar, from 101000 first dollars (101 once revalued) to 250 second dollars, a decrease of about 60% (see exchange rate history table below). ISO originally assigned a new <b>currency</b> <b>code</b> of ZWN to this redenominated currency, but the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe could not deal with a currency change, so the <b>currency</b> <b>code</b> remained 'ZWD'. The revaluation campaign, which Gideon Gono named [...] "Operation Sunrise", was completed on 21 August 2006. It was estimated that some ten trillion old Zimbabwe dollars (22% of the money supply) were not redeemed during this period.|$|E
