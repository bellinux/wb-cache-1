40|$|We analyse the {{mortality}} of couples by fitting a multiple state model {{to a large}} insurance data set. We find evidence that mortality rates increase {{after the death of}} a partner and, in addition, that this phenomenon diminishes over time. This is popularly known as a “broken-heart” effect and we find that it affects widowers more than widows. Remaining lifetimes of joint lives therefore exhibit short-term dependence. We carry out numerical work involving the pricing and valuation of typical <b>contingent</b> <b>assurance</b> contracts and of a joint life and survivor annuity. If insurers ignore dependence, or mis-specify it as long-term dependence, then significant mis-pricing and inappropriate provisioning can result. Detailed numerical results are presented...|$|E

Disney also allowed Friends of Port Disney to use their logo on invitations and bumper stickers.
