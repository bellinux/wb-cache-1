5|$|Arsenal {{were not}} to win the League or the FA Cup for another 18 years. The '53 Champions squad was old, and the club failed to attract strong enough replacements. Although Arsenal were {{competitive}} during these years, their fortunes had waned; the club {{spent most of the}} 1950s and 1960s in midleague mediocrity. Even former England captain Billy Wright <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> the club any success as manager, in a stint between 1962 and 1966.|$|E
5|$|The plane's {{landing gear}} {{mired in the}} water and mud, causing the plane to flip upside down and skid to a stop. Although the {{aircraft}} survived the landing nearly intact, Petty Officer Koga died instantly on impact, probably from a broken neck or a blunt-force blow to his head. Koga's wingmen, circling above, had orders to destroy any Zeros that crash-landed in enemy territory, but as they did not know if Koga was still alive, they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> themselves to strafe his plane. They decided to leave without firing on it. The Japanese submarine stationed off Akutan Island to pick up pilots searched for Koga in vain before being driven off by the destroyer USS Williamson.|$|E
5|$|Chotiner {{was given}} an office at the RNC, {{nominally}} as the official in charge of tickets for the inauguration. RNC chairman Ray Bliss and his aides were disturbed by his presence, and were told he would be gone after January 20. Meanwhile, Nixon and his aides considered a new RNC chairman finally settling on Maryland Congressman Rogers Morton, who agreed to take the position once Bliss left, though Morton was not told of the promise to Chotiner. When the President-elect met with Bliss on January 10, 1969, he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> himself to fire the chairman. With the situation unresolved, and Morton's appointment unannounced, Chotiner sat in his RNC office for {{a month after the}} inauguration with nothing to do, as the RNC staff wondered at his presence.|$|E

5|$|Erzherzog Ferdinand Max {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in Trieste on 6 May 1863. She was launched on 24 May 1865; the builders were forced to complete fitting-out work quickly, as tensions with neighboring Prussia and Italy erupted into the concurrent Austro-Prussian War and the Third Italian War of Independence in June 1866. Erzherzog Ferdinand Maxs rifled heavy guns were still on order from Krupp, and {{they could not be}} delivered due to the conflict with Prussia. Instead, the ship was armed with old smooth-bore guns. Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, the commander of the Austrian Fleet, immediately began to mobilize his fleet. As the ships became fully manned, they began to conduct training exercises in Fasana. With his flag aboard Erzherzog Ferdinand Max, Tegetthoff brought the Austrian fleet to Ancona on 26 June in an attempt to draw out the Italians, but the Italian commander, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, refused to engage Tegetthoff. Tegetthoff made another sortie on 6 July, but again <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> the Italian fleet to battle.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{destroyer}} attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Collingwood and {{the rest}} of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard the fleet flagship over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> his fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its night-time cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. Collingwood fired a total of 52 armour-piercing, capped and 32 HE shells from her main armament and 35 four-inch shells during the battle. Prince Albert was a sub-lieutenant commanding the forward turret during the battle and sat in the open on the turret roof during a lull in the action.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{destroyer}} attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Iron Duke and {{the rest}} of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard Iron Duke over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> his fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its nighttime cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. Iron Duke returned to Scapa Flow, arriving at 11:30. Over the course of the battle, Iron Duke had fired ninety rounds from her main battery, along with fifty rounds from her secondary guns.|$|E

5|$|Following the German {{torpedo boat}} attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Benbow {{and the rest}} of the Grand Fleet saw no further {{significant}} action in the battle. This was, in part, due to poor communication between Jellicoe and his subordinates over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> his fleet to action. Benbow fired briefly at a group of torpedo boats at about 21:10, with a salvo of 6-inch shells and a single 13.5-inch round. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its nighttime cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. In the course of the battle, Benbow had fired forty 13.5-inch armour-piercing, capped shells and sixty 6-inch rounds.|$|E
5|$|Habsburg {{was built}} by the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in Trieste. Her keel was laid down in June 1863, and she was launched on 24 June 1865. The builders were forced to complete fitting-out work quickly, as tensions with neighboring Prussia and Italy erupted into the concurrent Austro-Prussian War and the Third Italian War of Independence in June 1866. Habsburgs rifled heavy guns were still on order from Krupp, and {{they could not be}} delivered due to the conflict with Prussia. Instead, the ship was armed with old smooth-bore guns. Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, the commander of the Austrian Fleet, immediately began to mobilize his fleet. As the ships became fully manned, they began to conduct training exercises in Fasana. On 26 June, Tegetthoff sortied with the Austrian fleet and steamed to Ancona in an attempt to draw out the Italians, but the Italian commander, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, refused to engage Tegetthoff. Tegetthoff made another sortie on 6 July, but again <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> the Italian fleet to battle.|$|E
5|$|Halperin {{cautioned that}} Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, {{and some of}} the {{statements}} about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> herself to raise the subject.|$|E
25|$|On {{the weaker}} east front of Army Group Kempf, the Soviet 57th Army cleared the right {{bank of the}} Donets between Chuguyev & Zmiyev, but the army command somehow <b>could</b> <b>not</b> quite <b>bring</b> itself to try for a full scale breakthrough.|$|R

5|$|It {{was found}} that Choor Singh had two private {{contacts}} with a material witness {{in the course of}} the disciplinary proceedings, even though it is a well-established rule that a decision-maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings or any of his witnesses in the absence of the other party or his counsel. The High Court found that there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh might or <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> an unprejudiced mind to the disciplinary inquiry. The key finding was that the two private contacts with the material witness gave an appearance of a real likelihood of bias. On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E
5|$|Kaiser Max {{was built}} by the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) shipyard; her keel was laid down in October 1861, and her {{completed}} hull was launched on 14 March 1862. Fitting-out work was completed the following year, when she was commissioned into the Austrian fleet. She proved to be very wet forward owing to her open bow, and as a result, tended to handle poorly. In June 1866, Italy declared war on Austria, {{as part of the}} Third Italian War of Independence, which was fought concurrently with the Austro-Prussian War. Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, the commander of the Austrian Fleet, immediately began to mobilize his fleet. As the ships became fully manned, they began to conduct training exercises in Fasana. Tegetthoff brought the Austrian fleet to Ancona on 27 June, in an attempt to draw out the Italians, but the Italian commander, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, refused to engage Tegetthoff.

5|$|While Royal Oak was {{attacking the}} battlecruisers, a German torpedo boat {{flotilla}} launched {{an attack on}} the British line. Royal Oaks secondary guns were the first to open fire, at 19:16, followed quickly {{by the rest of the}} British line. Following the German destroyer attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Royal Oak and the rest of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard the fleet flagship over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>bring</b> his fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its night-time cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none.
