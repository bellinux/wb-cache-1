25|$|For spatial simulations, {{geometries}} can be {{specified by}} analytic geometry equations, derived from combination of simple shapes or derived from imported images, such as 3D <b>confocal</b> <b>microscope</b> stacks. Utilities for segmenting image data into regions such as nucleus, cytosol and extracellular are provided.|$|E
25|$|An {{offshoot}} of IRENE, the <b>Confocal</b> <b>Microscope</b> Cylinder Project, can capture a high-resolution three-dimensional {{image of the}} surface, down to 200µm. In order to convert to a digital sound file, this is then played by {{a version of the}} same 'virtual stylus' program developed by the research team in real-time, converted to digital and, if desired, processed through sound-restoration programs.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{preserve}} the historic content of the recordings, cylinders can be read with a <b>confocal</b> <b>microscope</b> and converted to a digital audio format. The resulting sound clip in most cases sounds better than stylus playback from the original cylinder. Having an electronic version of the original recordings enables archivists to open access to the recordings to a wider audience. This technique also {{has the potential to}} allow for reconstruction of damaged or broken cylinders.|$|E

50|$|Microlens {{enhanced}} or dual spinning disk <b>confocal</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{work under}} the same principles as spinning-disk <b>confocal</b> <b>microscopes</b> except a second spinning disk containing micro-lenses is placed before the spinning disk containing the pinholes. Every pinhole has an associated micro-lens. The micro-lenses act to capture a broad band of light and focus it into each pinhole significantly {{increasing the amount of}} light directed into each pinhole and reducing the amount of light blocked by the spinning disk. Microlens enhanced <b>confocal</b> <b>microscopes</b> are therefore significantly more sensitive than standard spinning disk systems. Yokogawa Electric invented this technology in 1992.|$|R

25|$|The major {{limitation}} of these bimane based probes {{and many other}} reported probes is that these probes are based on irreversible chemical reactions with glutathione, which renders these probes incapable of monitoring the real-time glutathione dynamics. Recently, the first reversible reaction based fluorescent probe-ThiolQuant Green (TQG)-for glutathione was reported. ThiolQuant Green can not only perform high resolution measurements of glutathione levels in single cells using a <b>confocal</b> <b>microscope,</b> but also be applied in flow cytometry to perform bulk measurements.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} modern developments. The {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) and the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) are two early versions of scanning probes that launched nanotechnology. There are other types of scanning probe microscopy. Although conceptually similar to the scanning <b>confocal</b> <b>microscope</b> developed by Marvin Minsky in 1961 and the scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) developed by Calvin Quate and coworkers in the 1970s, newer scanning probe microscopes have much higher resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a visual}} {{examination}} and a dermatoscopic exam, or in vivo diagnostic {{tools such as}} a <b>confocal</b> <b>microscope,</b> the doctor may biopsy the suspicious mole. A skin biopsy performed under local anesthesia is often required to assist in making or confirming the diagnosis and in defining severity. Elliptical excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, followed by histological analysis and Breslow scoring. Incisional biopsies such as punch biopsies are usually contraindicated in suspected melanomas, because {{of the possibility of}} sampling error or local implantation causing misestimation of tumour thickness. However, fears that such biopsies may increase the risk of metastatic disease seem unfounded.|$|E

5000|$|In some <b>microscopes</b> (mainly <b>confocal</b> <b>microscopes),</b> it is {{possible}} to make use of different lifetime of the excited states of the added fluorescent markers and the endogenous molecules to exclude most of the autofluorescence.|$|R
50|$|A {{cohort of}} {{biologists}} and science educators, the AMS's members use {{a wide array}} of microscopical techniques (light microscopy, electron microscopy, fluorescence and <b>confocal</b> <b>microscopes)</b> to further their research and eventually publish their research in its journal Invertebrate Biology.|$|R
25|$|The RealThiol (RT) probe is {{the second}} {{generation}} reversible reaction-based GSH probe developed by the Wang group. A few key features of RealThiol: 1) it has a much faster forward and backward reaction kinetics compared to ThiolQuant Green, which enables real time monitoring of GSH dynamics in live cells. 2) only micromolar to sub-micromolar RealThiol is needed for staining in cell based experiments, which induces minimal perturbation to GSH level in cells. 3) a high quantum yield coumarin fluorophore was implemented so that background noise can be minimized 4) equilibrium constant of the reaction between RealThiol and GSH has been fine tuned to respond to physiologically relevant concentration of GSH. RealThiol {{can be used to}} perform measurements of glutathione levels in single cells using a high resolution <b>confocal</b> <b>microscope,</b> as well as be applied in flow cytometry to perform bulk measurements in high throughput manner.|$|E
2500|$|Any of {{the image}} {{correlation}} spectroscopy methods can also be performed on a spinning disk <b>confocal</b> <b>microscope,</b> which in practice can obtain faster imaging speeds compared to a laser scanning <b>confocal</b> <b>microscope.</b> [...] This approach has recently been applied to diffusion in a spatially varying complex environment, producing a pixel resolution map of a diffusion coefficient. The spatial mapping of diffusion with FCS has subsequently been extended to the TIRF system. Spatial mapping of dynamics using correlation techniques had been applied before, but only at sparse points or at coarse resolution.|$|E
2500|$|Minsky's inventions {{include the}} first head-mounted {{graphical}} display (1963) and the <b>confocal</b> <b>microscope</b> (1957, a predecessor to today's widely used confocal laser scanning microscope). [...] He developed, with Seymour Papert, the first Logo [...] "turtle". [...] Minsky also built, in 1951, the first randomly wired neural network learning machine, SNARC.|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} in optical architecture promises small-scale, high-resolution in vivo imaging for medical applications. Single-axis <b>confocal</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{are commonly used}} to obtain high-resolution images of biological tissue. Traditionally, excised tissue samples are fixed with preservative chemicals and in-spected under a tabletop microscope. However, there is now rapidly growing interest in in vivo imaging, which will permit observation of biological processes that were previously inacces-sible. The biggest challenge in realizing this goal is miniaturiz-ing themicroscope while maintaining high resolution and image quality. Extended efforts toward constructing small versions of single-axis <b>confocal</b> <b>microscopes</b> have involved either shifting the op-tical fiber movement or using the lens to scan the sample. But the results are neither fast enough for real-time imag...|$|R
50|$|Two-photon {{excitation}} microscopy: Although {{they use}} a related technology (both are laser scanning microscopes), multiphoton fluorescence microscopes are not strictly <b>confocal</b> <b>microscopes.</b> The term <b>confocal</b> arises from {{the presence of a}} diaphragm in the conjugated focal plane (confocal). This diaphragm is usually absent in multiphoton microscopes.|$|R
5000|$|Four {{types of}} <b>confocal</b> <b>microscopes</b> are commercially available:Confocal laser {{scanning}} microscopes use multiple mirrors (typically 2 or 3 scanning linearly along the x and the y axis) {{to scan the}} laser across the sample and [...] "descan" [...] the image across a fixed pinhole and detector.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the motion}} is slow (in biology, for example, {{diffusion}} in a membrane), getting adequate statistics from a single-point FCS experiment {{may take a}} prohibitively long time. [...] More data {{can be obtained by}} performing the experiment in multiple spatial points in parallel, using a laser scanning <b>confocal</b> <b>microscope.</b> [...] This approach has been called Image Correlation Spectroscopy (ICS). [...] The measurements can then be averaged together.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{variations}} of FCS are only applicable to serial scanning laser microscopes. [...] Image Correlation Spectroscopy and its variations all were implemented on a scanning confocal or scanning two photon microscope, but transfer to other microscopes, like a spinning disk <b>confocal</b> <b>microscope.</b> [...] Raster ICS (RICS), and position sensitive FCS (PSFCS) incorporate the time delay between {{parts of the}} image scan into the analysis. [...] Also, low-dimensional scans (e.g. a circular ring)only possible on a scanning systemcan access time scales between single point and full image measurements. [...] Scanning path has also been made to adaptively follow particles.|$|E

25|$|Urea in {{concentrations}} up to 8 M {{can be used}} to make fixed {{brain tissue}} transparent to visible light while still preserving fluorescent signals from labeled cells.

40|$|Confocal {{fluorescence}} microscopy {{is often used}} in brain imaging experiments, however conventional <b>confocal</b> <b>microscopes</b> are limited in their field of view, working distance, and speed for high resolution imaging.

This multiregion and multi-spot imaging method can be used in other imaging modalities, such as multiphoton microscopes, and the field of view can be extended well beyond 12 mm x 12 mm...|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} explore the 3D {{capabilities}} of the <b>confocal</b> <b>microscope,</b> the instrument still had to be combined with high-end graphics computers. The first combination of a <b>confocal</b> <b>microscope</b> with specialized computer hardware that enabled digital image processing was presented by Van der Voort et al. (1985). In the late 1980s, Biorad introduced the first commercial laser scanning <b>confocal</b> <b>microscope</b> to the market, followed by Carl Zeiss and Leica soon after. All of these instruments delivered quality 3D images however, there was no software to properly visualize and analyze the content.
