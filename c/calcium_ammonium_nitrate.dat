40|$|Among {{fundamental}} nutrients, nitrogen fertilization {{is considered}} one of the most effective factors affecting both the yield and the quality of plant material. Nitrogen form used for fertilizing is also of great importance. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of nitrogen nutrition (<b>calcium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> and urea) as well as (green, purple, and‘Fino Verde’) on the chemical composition and yielding of basil (Ocimum basilicumL.). After drying the plant material at a temperature of 60 °C and milling, total nitrogen was determined by means of Kjeldahl method, while mineral nitrogen content (N-NH 4, N-NO 3) was analyzed in 2 % acetic acid extract. Yield of fresh basil matter depended significantly on the variety grown. The highest yields were obtained from a cultivar of ‘Fino Verde’ fertilized with <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate.</b> The purple variety plants fertilized with urea were characterized by a largest amount of total nitrogen.

40|$|Abstract. New {{pseudostem}} cultivars of Japanese bunching onion {{may be a}} good alterna-tive {{to common}} bulb onion grown for bunches in early spring season. There is still limited knowledge upon the requirement of this vegetable species for nitrogen fertilization. In two factorial field experiment, <b>calcium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> and Entec 26 – nitrogen mineral fertilizer containing DMPP nitrification inhibitor used as the source of N and ap-plied at the rates of 75, 150 and 225 kg·ha- 1 were compared. Seed propagated transplants produced in the greenhouse were planted in early April and harvested after 10 weeks of cultivation in the open field. The yield and nutritional value of edible parts expressed by the content of dry matter, vitamin C, total chlorophyll, carotenoids, volatile oils, total N, NO 3 – N, P K Ca and Mg were estimated. Results of the study proved that all tested fertil-izers were equally valuable sources of nitrogen for Japanese bunching onion. The use of Entec 26 was associated with higher amounts of total chlorophyll and carotenoids in edi-ble part of plants if compared to commonly recommended <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> and similar to calcium nitrate. The other important advantage of this fertilizer was a substantial de-cline of nitrates content. The increment of preplant nitrogen rate from 75 to 150 and 225 kg·ha- 1 did not affect the crop yield and significantly enhanced the nitrates accumula-tion in plants at harvest.

40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} characteristics and confidence limits {{associated with the}} overall absolute error in NADP/NTN measurements are identified and quantified. Data from the U. S.

Absolute errors are estimated by comparison of paired measurements from collocated instruments. Spatial {{and temporal}} differences in absolute error were identified and are consistent with longitudinal distributions of NADP/NTN measurements and spatial differences in precipitation characteristics. The magnitude of error for <b>calcium,</b> magnesium, <b>ammonium,</b> <b>nitrate,</b> and sulfate concentrations, specific conductance, and sample volume is of minor environmental significance to data users.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between shoot growth and foliar nitrogen (N) in E. globulus seedlings was {{studied in the}} glasshouse to determine standard values for N deficiency and toxicity diagnosis. Seedlings were grown for 9 weeks in yellow sand, at 10 rates of N, applied as <b>ammonium</b> sulphate, <b>calcium</b> <b>nitrate</b> or <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate.</b> Shoot dry weight (DW) increased linearly with N rate for all forms of N in the deficiency range.

Maximum shoot DW for nitrate fed plants and <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate</b> fed plants were 51 % and 84 % respectively of ammonium fed plants.

Mycorrhizal grapevine plants had higher shoot dry weight and number of leaves than non-mycorrhizal and with a higher growth response with calcium nitrate as the N source. For the macronutrients P and K, and for the micronutrient B, leaf concentration was higher in mycorrhizal plants. Non-mycorrhizal plants had higher concentration of microelements Zn, Mn, Fe, and Cu than mycorrhizal. There were no differences in soluble solids (degrees Brix) in grapevine berries among mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants.

40|$|Three {{glasshouse}} experiments, using light textured soils, {{were conducted}} to investigate the effects of nitrogen (N) source and calcitic lime on i) soil pHw(soil pH in water), ii) tuber yield, iii) leaf chemical composition, and iv) cadmium (Cd) accumulation in tubers of the potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) cultivars Russet Burbank and Atlantic. The N sources applied were <b>calcium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> urea, and <b>ammonium</b> sulfate. Rates of calcitic lime ranged from 0 to 20 t ha- 1. Liming increased soil pHwvalues up to 2. 8 units, and depending on sampling time, differences in soil pHwof up to 1. 8 units occurred between the N sources. In 2 of the 3 experiments {{there was a significant}} interaction between lime and N source in their effects on tuber yield. When calcium nitrate was the N source, liming decreased tuber yields. In contrast, with ammonium sulfate yield increased. The effects of liming and N source on the chemical composition of the 5 th leaf were not consistent between experiments. Liming significantly decreased potassium (K), sulfur (S), boron (B), and manganese (Mn) concentrations and increased calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) concentrations. The application of ammonium sulfate consistently decreased Ca and Mg concentrations in the 5 th leaf compared with calcium nitrate. Liming significantly decreased tuber Cd concentrations in all experiments. The use of calcium nitrate as the N source resulted in significantly higher Cd concentrations in tubers compared with ammonium sulfate when no calcitic lime was applied. It is possible that Ca added in this fertilizer enhanced Cd uptake through displacement of Cd from soil surfaces. N. A. Maier, M. J. McLaughlin, M. Heap, M. Butt and M. K. Smar...|$|R
