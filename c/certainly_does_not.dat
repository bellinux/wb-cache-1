5|$|Dawkins is an atheist, and is {{well known}} for his {{criticism}} of creationism and intelligent design. In The Blind Watchmaker (1986), he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In The God Delusion (2006), Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> exist and that religious faith is a delusion. He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{a planet}} around Alpha Centauri B was announced, but in 2015 a new {{analysis}} {{concluded that it}} almost <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> exist and was just a spurious artefact of the data analysis.|$|E
25|$|Typically {{this element}} is {{expressed}} as {{the intent to}} commit a felony “therein”. The {{use of the word}} “therein” adds nothing and <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> limit the scope of burglary to those wrongdoers who break and enter a dwelling intending to commit a felony on the premises. The situs of the felony does not matter, and burglary occurs if the wrongdoer intended to commit a felony at the time he broke and entered.|$|E

25|$|The coachwhip {{trevally}} has had extremely {{little information}} collected regarding its diet, ecological interactions, reproduction and growth. Based on other {{fish in the}} same genus, it is certainly a predatory fish, although its diet is wholly unknown. The species is of very little importance to fisheries, and <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have catch statistics kept for it, usually counted among other species of trevally. It is usually taken as bycatch in trawling and hook and line fisheries.|$|E
500|$|Positive {{comments}} {{came from}} functionalist architect Erich Mendelsohn in 1938, who wrote to Holden {{that he was}} [...] "very much taken and am convinced {{that there is no}} finer building in London." [...] Architectural historian Arnold Whittick described the building as a [...] "static massive pyramid ... obviously designed to last for a thousand years", but thought [...] "the interior is more pleasing than the exterior. There is essentially the atmosphere of dignity, serenity and repose that one associates with the architecture of ancient Greece." [...] Nikolaus Pevsner was less enthusiastic. He described its style as [...] "strangely semi-traditional, undecided modernism" [...] and summarised the result: [...] "The design <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> possess the vigour and directness of Charles Holden's smaller Underground stations." [...] Others have described it as Stalinist or as totalitarian due to its great scale.|$|E
500|$|For the 2004–05 season, {{the team}} {{moved into the}} Atlantic Division and the Raptors decided to revamp the team. Raptors President and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Richard Peddie fired Grunwald on April 1, 2004, after the team ended the season three games short of the eighth and final playoff spot in the {{previous}} season. Head coach Kevin O'Neill and his four assistant coaches were also dismissed immediately after Grunwald's termination. Toronto interim manager Jack McCloskey said: [...] "While the blame for that <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> rest on O'Neill and his staff alone, we need a change." [...] Rob Babcock was named General Manager on June 7, 2004, alongside the appointments of Wayne Embry as senior advisor and Alex English as director of player development. Sam Mitchell, a former NBA forward and assistant coach of the Milwaukee Bucks, was hired as new {{head coach of the}} Raptors.|$|E

500|$|Gabrielle Union, a {{rape victim}} {{and one of the}} main stars of The Birth of a Nation, wrote in the Los Angeles Times, [...] "As {{important}} and ground-breaking as this film is, I cannot take these allegations lightly. On that night, 17-odd years ago, did Nate have his date’s consent? It’s very possible he thought he did. Yet by his own admission he did not have verbal affirmation; and even if she never said “no,” silence <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> equal “yes.” Although it’s often difficult to read and understand body language, the fact that some individuals interpret the absence of a “no” as a “yes” is problematic at least, criminal at worst." [...] Sources suggest that Parker and Celestin's accuser was either unconscious or extremely drunk when Parker invited Celestin to have sex with her (Parker was already actively engaged in a sex act with her at the time).|$|E
500|$|Senate House divided opinion.

[...] The onset of the Second World War prevented any further progress on the full scheme, although Adams, Holden & Pearson did design further buildings for the university in the vicinity.|$|E
500|$|Dawkins rose to {{prominence}} in public debates relating {{science and religion}} {{since the publication of}} his most popular book The God Delusion in 2006, which became an international best seller. As of 2015, more than three million copies were sold and the book has been translated into over 30 languages. Its success has been seen by many as indicative of a change in the contemporary cultural zeitgeist and has also been identified with the rise of New Atheism. In the book, Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> exist and that religious faith is a delusion—"a fixed false belief". In his February 2002 TED talk entitled [...] "Militant atheism", Dawkins urged all atheists to openly state their position and to fight the incursion of the church into politics and science. On 30 September 2007, Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett met at Hitchens' residence for a private, unmoderated discussion that lasted two hours. The event was videotaped and titled [...] "The Four Horsemen".|$|E

500|$|Henry Brougham {{wrote of}} the public {{reaction}} to Charlotte's death, [...] "It really was as though every household throughout Great Britain had lost a favourite child." [...] The whole kingdom went into deep mourning; linen-drapers ran out of black cloth. [...] Even the poor and homeless tied armbands of black on their clothes. [...] The shops closed for two weeks, as did the Royal Exchange, the Law Courts, and the docks. [...] Even gambling dens shut down {{on the day of}} her funeral, as a mark of respect. [...] Wrote The Times, [...] "It <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> belong to us to repine at the visitations of Providence... there is nothing impious in grieving for that as a calamity." [...] Mourning was so complete that the makers of ribbons and other fancy goods (which could not be worn during the period of mourning) petitioned the government to shorten the period, fearing they would otherwise go bankrupt. [...] A dissenting note was struck by poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, who in his An Address to the People on the Death of the Princess Charlotte, indicated that the execution of three men the day after the Princess's death for plotting to overthrow the government was a greater tragedy.|$|E
500|$|Homer is an [...] "everyman" [...] and embodies several American {{stereotypes}} of working class blue-collar men: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, dim witted, clumsy and a borderline alcoholic. Matt Groening describes him as [...] "completely ruled by his impulses". Dan Castellaneta calls him [...] "a dog {{trapped in a}} man's body", adding, [...] "He's incredibly loyal– not entirely clean– but you gotta love him." [...] In his book Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner describes Homer as [...] "the most American of the Simpsons" [...] and believes that while the other Simpson family members could be changed to other nationalities, Homer is [...] "pure American". In the book God in the Details: American Religion in Popular Culture, the authors comment that [...] "Homer's progress (or lack thereof) reveals a character who can do the right thing, if accidentally or begrudgingly." [...] The book [...] includes a chapter analyzing Homer's character {{from the perspective of}} Aristotelian virtue ethics. Raja Halwani writes that Homer's [...] "love of life" [...] is an admirable character trait, [...] "for many people are tempted to see in Homer nothing but buffoonery and immorality. [...] He is not politically correct, he is more than happy to judge others, and he <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> seem to be obsessed with his health. These qualities might not make Homer an admirable person, but they do make him admirable in some ways, and, more importantly, makes us crave him and the Homer Simpsons of this world." [...] In 2008, Entertainment Weekly justified designating The Simpsons as a television classic by stating, [...] "we all hail Simpson patriarch Homer because his joy is as palpable as his stupidity is stunning".|$|E

2500|$|For a {{long time}} Adventists held the concept that the pre-advent {{judgment}} was only concerned with God judging mankind and deciding their eternal destiny.

2500|$|Arguments {{about the}} {{existence}} of God typically include empirical, deductive, and inductive types. Different views include that: [...] "God does not exist" [...] (strong atheism); [...] "God almost <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> exist" [...] (de facto atheism); [...] "no one knows whether God exists" [...] (agnosticism);"God exists, but this cannot be proven or disproven" [...] (de facto theism); and that [...] "God exists and this can be proven" [...] (strong theism).|$|E

2500|$|Many of German's {{colleagues in}} the musical {{establishment}} did, however, find his work {{to be of the}} highest quality, including Elgar and Sir John Barbirolli. A recording of his Richard III, Theme and Six Diversions and The Seasons was released by Naxos in 1994. Hulme writes that [...] "German's orchestral music <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> deserve the neglect it has suffered, for it still has much to offer modern audiences.

Banas said that Mrs. Drew felt [...] "terrible" [...] about Meier's death. A vigil was held for Megan Meier on November 24, 2007.
