5000|$|Fred ('Freddie') W. Barnes {{was hired}} as chief {{engineer}} in 1905, and patented the [...] "Gradua" [...] variable-ratio belt drive transmission that year. The Gradua system simultaneously changed {{the diameter of the}} crankshaft belt-drive pulley to alter the drive ratio, while moving the rear wheel forward or back to maintain belt tension. [...] The Gradua's action was controlled by a rotating lever atop the fuel tank, and was among the first attempts to provide multiple drive ratios for a motorcycle, at a time when very simple, direct belt-drive transmission was the industry norm. Variable drive ratios proved a significant advantage in competition, leading riders of other marques to complain the Gradua gave an unfair advantage; eventually Zeniths with Gradua gears were banned from many competitions. Zenith capitalized on this ban, adding the word [...] "Barred" [...] to their advertising and logo. The Gradua system was replaced by the now-standard gearbox and <b>chain</b> <b>transmission</b> in 1924.|$|E
50|$|CC1 was a {{double-ended}} tank locomotive on two three-axle bogies, all {{wheels on}} each bogie {{being driven by}} a two-cylinder steam engine via a <b>chain</b> <b>transmission.</b> A double-ended boiler, comprising two square barrels and a single central firebox, was located in {{the central part of}} the locomotive. Turf and water were supplied from bunkers and tanks at either end. As in 356, augers were used to feed turf from the bunkers to the firebox, where two mechanical stokers were fitted. Between the bunkers and the boiler were the cabs and a smokebox and superheater for each boiler barrel. Hot gases were ducted from the smokeboxes to feedwater heaters and then to induction fans (driven by steam turbines) before exhausting from the locomotive's two chimneys. Spark arrestors were fitted at a later stage, along with a system for passing captured sparks back to the firebox. The overall layout resembled a Double Fairlie, although CC1 differed in having only one boiler and in having its buffers and drawgear mounted on the locomotive frame, rather than on the bogies.|$|E
