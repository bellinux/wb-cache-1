60|$|And {{thus the}} whole private {{life of the}} street was {{threaded}} in lights. There {{was a sense of}} indecent exposure, from so many backs. He felt himself almost in physical contact with this contiguous stretch of back premises. He heard the familiar sound of water gushing from the sink in to the grate, the dropping of a pail outside the door, the clink of a <b>coal</b> <b>shovel,</b> the banging of a door, the sound of voices. So many houses cheek by jowl, so many squirming lives, so many back yards, back doors giving on to the night. It was revolting.|$|E

5000|$|At first, {{the trip}} remains uneventful.

5000|$|In the 19th century, Frederick Winslow Taylor {{pioneered the}} [...] "scientific management" [...] method, which {{proposed}} {{a way to}} find the optimum method of carrying out a given task. Taylor found that he could, for example, triple the amount of coal that workers were shoveling by incrementally reducing the size and weight of <b>coal</b> <b>shovels</b> until the fastest shoveling rate was reached. Frank and Lillian Gilbreth expanded Taylor's methods in the early 1900s to develop the [...] "time and motion study". They aimed to improve efficiency by eliminating unnecessary steps and actions. By applying this approach, the Gilbreths {{reduced the number of}} motions in bricklaying from 18 to 4.5, allowing bricklayers to increase their productivity from 120 to 350 bricks per hour.|$|R

5000|$|The Shovelhead {{engine is}} a {{motorcycle}} engine that {{was produced by}} Harley-Davidson from 1966 to 1984, built as a successor to the previous Panhead engine. When the engine was first produced, the Shovelhead had a shallower combustion chamber, larger valve drop for both intake and exhaust, better porting, and stronger valves and pistons. This gave the new engine an extra 10 horsepower, along with a different appearance. The engine gained the nickname “Shovelhead” due to {{the look of the}} rocker heads the heads having the appearance of an old <b>coal</b> <b>shovel</b> that was flipped upside down, giving the appearance of a shovel. While the engine did have problems earlier in its timeline, the new and improved motor gave Harley-Davidson a 26% sales increase.|$|E

25|$|On 21 January 1942, Jim Crawford {{enlisted in}} the Australian Army Medical Corps. Crawford wanted to enlist earlier {{but he had not}} been {{medically}} fit. When Crawford grew tired of peeling spuds he was discharged in September and worked as a stoker in the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, serving aboard mine-sweepers guarding the B.H.P steel works at Whyalla. While working as a stoker, Crawford founded a Worker's study group. Crawford also spoke at War Loan Rallies. At one rally he spoke on a platform with future Australian Prime Minister, Harold Holt, who shouted Crawford to a double whisky after his speech. Jim was charged with mutiny for organising to stop work of naval stokers until they were paid trade union rates. They stood firm and gained the Union rates they were after, however, Crawford was transferred to New Guinea to the Naval Depot HMS Ladava. In 1944, he experienced the bombing by the Japanese in New Guinea. He also served aboard an Icelandic fishing trawler converted to minesweeper HMS Beryl. While working on the minesweeper Crawford had to <b>shovel</b> <b>coal</b> into the furnace. This <b>coal</b> <b>shovelling</b> had caused permanent damage to Crawford's lungs and he developed emphysema. In January, 1945, he was discharged from the navy with a pension as he was suffering from a duodenal ulcer. Once discharged from the navy, he arrived back in Melbourne and wrote for large newspapers, such as the Sporting Globe and the Melbourne Guardian. He worked for the Melbourne Guardian for ten years, writing mostly about political issues.|$|R
50|$|The scenery outside quickly {{becomes a}} blur {{as the train}} travels faster and faster. Casey adds more coal to the engine's furnace, and, when running out, also uses up his <b>coal</b> <b>shovel</b> and rocking chair, until the ribbing on the engine's boiler {{exterior}} is forced off. Casey grabs and fits the engine's funnel back on, before it falls off, when the train speeds down one hill, it heads past a 7 mile sign, and burns it and the tracks. As the engine's cowcatcher nearly snaps off, Casey pulls it back on, before the engine's boiler gets so hot that the parts fall off, and while Casey manages to fix it time, he bravely gives his engine some running repairs while the train is seen roaring down a hill.|$|E
50|$|Tom slumps {{down and}} walks away, but hides behind a curtain, {{grabbing}} Jerry out of Butch's hand. Butch turns {{the corner to}} find only Tom, who is sitting on Jerry, but Jerry gives him away by lifting the cat up. Butch dumps Tom into a trash can and chases Jerry, but Tom runs {{into the kitchen and}} dresses himself up as Mammy to trick Butch. Butch offers Jerry to Tom, thinking he is Mammy, but Tom wallops Butch over the head with a frying pan. Butch then does the same thing in the living room, Tom falls for the same trick, getting walloped over the head with a <b>coal</b> <b>shovel.</b> Butch runs off with Jerry, but runs into an ironing board and knocks himself out, allowing Jerry to escape. Both cats pick up the weapons they were knocked out by and chase after the mouse.|$|E
50|$|A {{short while}} later, {{a group of}} armed men on horseback watch the train from up on a {{hillside}} in a desert and charge down toward the train because they think there's gold on Casey's engine. The next shot finds the whole gang inside the engine's cab, brandishing their guns and knives menacingly. At first, Casey is {{so caught up in}} stoking the engine's boiler with coal from the engine's coal tender, that he is oblivious to their presence and doesn't notice the thieves. It is in the next moment that he accidentally picks up one of the bandits standing on his coal shovel-full of coal that he finally notices the uninvited company before he nearly shovels a bandit into his engine's furnace. Even then, Casey is extremely annoyed by this new distraction than anything else and begins to fight the train bandits, hitting them repeatedly with his <b>coal</b> <b>shovel,</b> and continuing to stoke the engine's boiler with coal from the engine's coal tender.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{the dead}} man's switch, the {{electrification}} and dieselisation of railways also helped reduce the required {{staff in the}} locomotive to a sole driver - as diesel and electric traction {{does not require a}} fireman to <b>shovel</b> <b>coal</b> into a boiler.|$|R
50|$|At the Saltcoats coal yards the <b>coal</b> was <b>shovelled</b> into {{carts and}} then taken the half {{mile to the}} waiting ships where it was simply tumbled into hold causing more {{breakage}} and reduction in the coal size which was however said to suit {{the needs of the}} Irish market. The boats using the harbour could carry around 300 cart loads of coal at a time. 'Panwood' was a poorer quality coal not usually exported that was suitable for the saltpans.|$|R
