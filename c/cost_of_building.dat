5|$|Shaw had {{prepared}} preliminary designs of Woodland House by August 1875, and building began early in 1876, with construction being undertaken by W. H. Lascelles. The initial <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> {{the house was}} £4,500. Fildes and his family moved into {{the house in the}} Autumn of 1877. Fildes house was larger than Marcus Stone's, and costlier to build. Shortly after Fildes had commissioned Shaw to design his house, Fildes' grandmother, Mary, had died, leaving him her property.|$|E

In 1867 or 1869, she sold the house, the Collins Tract and the remainder of Lot Number20 to Charles Harmison (1823–1896) for $8,500, moving with her remaining children to Missouri (where she died in 1883). The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> the house financially strained the Parsons family; historian Catherine Snider Long suggests that Elizabeth Miller Parsons sold the house as a result of additional, war-related financial stress from which the family could not recover.|$|E
5|$|For {{various reasons}} it was {{impossible}} to apply some of the terms of the Act.

Despite efforts to ban outdoor relief, parishes continued to offer it as a more cost-effective method of dealing with pauperism. The Outdoor Labour Test Order and Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order were both issued to try to prevent people receiving relief outside of the workhouse.|$|E

The College was also granted the advowsons for the parishes. To cover the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> the College, Courtenay obtained a bull to levy a charge of fourpence in the pound on all ecclesiastical revenue raised in his archbishopric.

5|$|The District of Columbia {{government}} {{responded by}} threatening to veto any further Metro subway construction unless construction of the Green Line was made Metro's highest priority. Twenty-four hours of intense discussions later, Metro agreed to the District government's wishes. Construction began on the Waterfront Station, and the station was largely complete by January 1981. Once complete, the station was used for storage. By December 1980, Metro was still predicting that the Green Line to Anacostia would open in July 1986. But in January 1981, Metro admitted that the line would not open until at least 1990 because of funding constraints. Two months later, Metro estimated the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> the Green Line from U Street NW to Anacostia at $175 million.|$|E

5|$|These modernizations {{have been}} criticized by some naval historians, given that not only these ships would {{eventually}} prove to be inferior to the British battleships {{they were meant to}} face (namely the Queen Elizabeth-class), since by the time the decision to proceed was taken a war between Italy and the United Kingdom seemed more likely, but also because the cost of the reconstruction would be not much less than the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> a brand new Littorio-class battleship; moreover, the reconstruction work caused bottlenecks in the providing of steel plates, that caused substantial delays {{in the construction of the}} modern battleships, which otherwise might have been completed at an earlier date.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} arose regarding {{whether to}} lay natural or artificial turf. Kristofer Hæstad, one of Start's star players, {{stated that he}} would not continue to play for the club if artificial turf was laid. The contract with the municipality stated that the stadium would have to be built with artificial turf. In March, Start decided that they would instead lay natural grass, and if necessary pay the municipality for the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> another artificial turf venue. The name of the venue was announced on 21 October, after the club had signed a ten-year naming rights agreement with Sparebanken Sør worth NOK35 million. The rights to sell the naming rights were first transferred from the stadium owner to the company Rettighetskompaniet AS, which subsequently sold these to Sparebanken Sør.|$|E

This study aims to investigate the magnitude <b>of</b> workplace accident <b>costs</b> to building contractors and identify factors influencing workplace accident <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> projects. Data were collected using multiple techniques (structured interviews, archival records and questionnaires) from 47 completed building projects in Singapore. Data were analyzed using bivariate correlation analysis and moderated regression analysis. It is found that the average direct accident costs, indirect accident costs and total accident <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> projects account for 0. 165 %, 0. 086 % and 0. 25 % of contract sum, respectively. It is concluded that workplace accident <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> projects are influenced by accident rates, project hazard level, project size, company size and the involvement of sub-contractors. The {{findings of this study}} may enhance decision makers' understanding of financial implications of workplace accidents in their building projects and motivate them to undertake accident prevention initiatives voluntarily...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the impact of spatial {{implementation}} conditions on the effectiveness <b>of</b> investing in <b>building</b> a residential house in the Municipality of Prevalje. It looks at data on advertised and sold residential houses, and vacant building lots. Basic statistics are calculated. The <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> a new residential house are compared with the estimated market value of the appraised residential house in order to establish the rationality <b>of</b> investing in <b>building.</b> To discuss the influence spatial implementation conditions have on the effectiveness of investing, we examined how different ratios between the lay-out <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> and the area <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> plot, and different factors of the use of land affect the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> a residential house. We have established that spatial implementation conditions have very little influence on the effectiveness <b>of</b> investing in <b>building</b> a residential house. In the Municipality of Prevalje, such investments would not be rational, seeing that the estimated market value of a residential house is much lower than the estimated <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> a new residential house...|$|R

5|$|As {{early as}} 1980, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> the Auburn Dam was {{estimated}} at $1 billion. As of 2007, the cost to build the dam would be about $10 billion. Other projects to improve safety margins and spillway capacity of Folsom Dam, and to increase the capacity of levees in the Sacramento area, were projected to cost significantly less while also providing similar levels of flood protection. Also, the United States National Research Council believes that existing stream-flow records, which only date back about 150 years, are insuffient to justify {{the construction of a}} dam as large as Auburn. The amount of water supply that Auburn Dam would actually make available was also in question, because while the American River floods in some years, in other years it barely discharges enough water to fill already-existing reservoirs. This casted doubts that Auburn could deliver enough water to justify its own cost, or the completion of Folsom South Canal, the other major feature of the Auburn-Folsom South Unit Project.|$|E
5|$|Canada's Wonderland's first {{interactive}} dark {{ride was}} Scooby-Doo's Haunted Mansion (renamed Boo Blasters on Boo Hill after Cedar Fair's {{purchase of the}} park), which opened in 2000. It was designed by Sally Corporation and relies entirely on physical sets and theming rather than projected animations, and uses basic, moving props. About four years later, park management began discussing {{the addition of a}} new attraction inside Wonder Mountain. The technology available at the time meant the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> a more advanced dark ride was too expensive for a regional amusement park. In 2011, as technology improved and the costs decreased, the park started planning a second interactive dark ride. Several companies were contacted to design the audio-visual portion of the future ride; park management chose Triotech to do so.|$|E
5|$|In December 2016, {{after it}} was {{announced}} that Phase 2 might cost $6 billion, transit experts expressed concern that the Second Avenue Subway might be so excessively costly as to preclude construction of Phases 3 and 4, as well as future expansions. One expert stated that the Phase 1 project was the most expensive subway project in the world, and that compared to other subway systems around the world, the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> new subways in New York City was much higher. The Second Avenue Subway's per-mile construction cost is higher than that of other projects in similar cities like London's Crossrail and Paris's Grand Paris Express, which themselves are among the most expensive underground-railway projects in the world. MTA officials stated that the Second Avenue Subway cost as much as it did only because of the complex underground infrastructure in Manhattan, as well as the fact that the New York City Subway runs all the time.|$|E

5|$|The RAN {{conducted}} armament effectiveness {{studies of}} each of the six DDL variants in parallel with Y-ARD's development of the designs. These studies found that including an area air defence capability and an ability to operate two helicopters greatly improved the DDL's effectiveness. As a result, these features were included in the Navy's specification for the DDL design which was issued in late 1970. By this time the design had evolved to specify a general-purpose destroyer of 4,200 tons, armed with a five-inch gun and a Tartar missile launcher, and capable of operating two helicopters. The changes increased the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> the ships, and the number planned was reduced to three. Nevertheless, the DDL design was considered likely to result in very capable ships, with the 1972–73 edition of Jane's Fighting Ships commenting favourably.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} Caernarfon were {{built at the}} same time as the castle, under the overall {{supervision}} of Master James of Saint George, Edward's chief architect in North Wales. Between 1283 and 1284, Richard the Engineer acted as James' deputy on the site; later, between 1295 and 1308, Walter of Hereford performed a similar role, and may have also been responsible for earlier work on the walls as well. Huge amounts of labourers were mobilised from across England for the task, massed at Chester and then brought into Wales for each summer building season. Work on the walls progressed quickly, albeit in uneven bursts: local houses were demolished to make way for the fortifications and the stone walls and gates were probably finished by 1292. The <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> the town walls was around £3,500, a large sum for the period.|$|E
