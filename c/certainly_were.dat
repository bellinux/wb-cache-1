Taxes on wealth, social position, and ownership of the means of production (typically land and slaves) were all common. Practices such as tithing, or an offering of first fruits, existed from ancient times, and can be regarded as a precursor of the income tax, but they lacked precision and <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> not based on a concept of net increase.|$|E
500|$|Simon Wiesenthal {{and others}} have speculated about the {{existence}} of a Nazi fugitive network code-named ODESSA (an acronym for Organisation der ehemaligen SS-Angehörigen, Organization of former SS members) that allegedly helped war criminals find refuge in Latin America. British writer Gitta Sereny, who conducted interviews with SS men, considers the story untrue and attributes the escapes to postwar chaos and Hudal's Vatican-based network. While the existence of ODESSA remains unproven, Sereny notes that [...] "there <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> various kinds of Nazi aid organizations after the war — it would have been astonishing if there hadn't been." ...|$|E

After {{watching}} the film, Tezuka remarked [...] "Well, there <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> a lot of characters in the film.... here were also some that weren't in the film". Akai and Yamaga later realized the omission of Tezuka's characters; they were subsequently used in the Daicon IV animation. According to Toshio Okada, the theme of water in the opening represented [...] "opportunity" [...] and Lawrence Eng, an otaku researcher, describes the theme as, [...] "...making the best use of one's opportunities while fighting against those who would seek to steal such opportunity away." ...|$|E

500|$|Gernsback's new magazine, Amazing Stories, was successful, but Gernsback {{lost control}} of the {{publisher}} when it went bankrupt in February 1929. By April he had formed a new company, Gernsback Publications Incorporated, and created two subsidiaries: Techni-Craft Publishing Corporation and Stellar Publishing Corporation. Gernsback sent out letters advertising his plans for new magazines; the mailing lists he used almost <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> compiled from the subscription lists of Amazing Stories. This would have been illegal, as the lists were owned by Irving Trust, the receiver of the bankruptcy. Gernsback denied using the lists under oath, but historians have generally agreed that he must have done so. The letters also asked potential subscribers to decide the name of the new magazine; they voted for [...] "Science Wonder Stories", which became the name of one of Gernsback's new magazines.|$|E
500|$|The 2003 {{edition of}} the FA Community Shield, an annual English {{football}} match, was contested between Manchester United and Arsenal at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on 10 August. Lehmann made his first competitive start for Arsenal and Touré continued to partner Campbell in central defence. United took a 15th-minute lead through Mikaël Silvestre, but Henry equalised for Arsenal soon after, from a free-kick. Jeffers was sent off {{in the second half}} for kicking out at Phil Neville and no further goals scored meant the outcome of the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. Goalkeeper Tim Howard saved Van Bronckhorst and Pirès' spot kicks as United won the game 4–3 on penalties. Wenger made reference to Arsenal's low crowd turnout after the match and suggested it meant there was [...] "less and less appetite" [...] for the Shield. He was unhappy with the league season commencing on the following Saturday: [...] "I would have preferred to have had two more weeks, especially for the French players who were in the Confederations Cup. We <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> not as fit as Manchester United and know many of our players were behind them fitness-wise." ...|$|E
500|$|Academic {{debate over}} the Commission's value has been strong. On the one hand, William Holdsworth wrote that the Commission was riven by strife between its lawyerly members and those of a more radical nature, and that its {{proposals}} were sometimes extreme. Other academics argued that the reform scheme was of great merit, and Hostettler, writes that [...] "there {{is no evidence to}} confirm the belief of Sir William Holdsworth that the lawyers had a difficult time with the laymen". Mary Cotterell, writing in the English Historical Review, notes that 13 of the 21 members were certainly not radicals, although Moyer and Bemers, Blount and Peters <b>certainly</b> <b>were.</b> The lawyers, all moderates, nevertheless dominated the discussions. Debate was on a highly technical level which prevented many of the laymen contributing much, although six of them had been educated at the Inns of Court. The large number of meetings and sheer volume of work produced also suggests that there was little dissent and argument. John Hostettler, in his biography of Hale, has suggested that if the measures had been put into law immediately, [...] "we would have been honouring such pioneers for their farsightedness in enhancing our legal system and the concept of justice".|$|E

500|$|In 1902 Bohuslav Brauner {{suggested}} {{that there was a}} then-unknown element with properties intermediate between those of the known elements neodymium (60) and samarium (62); this was confirmed in 1914 by Henry Moseley who, having measured the atomic numbers of all the elements then known, found there was no element with atomic number 61. In 1926, two groups (one Italian and one American) claimed to have isolated a sample of element 61; both [...] "discoveries" [...] were soon proven to be false. In 1938, during a nuclear experiment conducted at Ohio State University, a few radioactive nuclides were produced that <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> not radioisotopes of neodymium or samarium, but {{there was a lack of}} chemical proof that element 61 was produced, and the discovery was not generally recognized. Promethium was first produced and characterized at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1945 by the separation and analysis of the fission products of uranium fuel irradiated in a graphite reactor. The discoverers proposed the name [...] "prometheum" [...] (the spelling was subsequently changed), derived from Prometheus, the Titan in Greek mythology who stole fire from Mount Olympus and brought it down to humans, to symbolize [...] "both the daring and the possible misuse of mankind's intellect." [...] However, a sample of the metal was made only in 1963.|$|E

[...] He published a variety of decipherments between 1922 and 1930, concluding finally that, although he had failed to find them, there <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> concealed messages.

2500|$|The Portland Oregon Journal {{reported}} on July 4 receiving {{a letter from}} an L. G. Bernier of Richland, Washington (about [...] east of Mt. Adams and [...] southeast of Mt. Rainier). Bernier wrote that he saw three of the strange objects over Richland flying [...] "almost edgewise" [...] toward Mt. Rainier about one half-hour before Arnold. Bernier thought the three {{were part of a}} larger formation. He indicated they were traveling at high speed: [...] "I have seen a P-38 appear seemingly on one horizon and then gone to the opposite horizon in no time at all, but these disks <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> traveling faster than any P-38. [...] No doubt Mr. Arnold saw them just a few minutes or seconds later, according to their speed." [...] The previous day, Bernier had also spoken to his local newspaper, the Richland Washington Villager, and was among the first witnesses to suggest extraterrestrial origins: [...] "I believe it may be a visitor from another planet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry Cow's {{music was}} {{challenging}} and uncompromising and this often led to them {{being accused of}} deliberately making their music inaccessible. As a result, they were virtually ignored in their own country. Even Virgin Records, who had started dropping experimental groups in favour of commercial ones, was now showing little to no interest in Henry Cow. This led to the group having to continuously make decisions as to whether to continue or not (there <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> no economic inducements). Cutler said, [...] "We had to make what amounted to political decisions about {{the organization of the}} group and its relation to the commercial structures, and this was bound to be reflected in the music too." [...] Henry Cow's anti-capitalist stance was brought on partly out of necessity rather than choice. They began working outside the music industry and doing everything for themselves. They abandoned agencies and managers and stopped looking for approval from the music press. Henry Cow quickly became self-sufficient and self-reliant.|$|E

2500|$|Newspaper reports or {{scores of}} satires {{of the eighteenth}} century provide {{substantial}} amount of information on thriving extensive gay subculture in the City of London of that period. So called [...] "molly markets" [...] for [...] "picking up trade", [...] among which Moorfields and St. James's Park were most notorious, <b>certainly</b> <b>were</b> not difficult to find. Not only did the open areas see [...] "mollies', named so either according to the Latin word for [...] "soft" [...] or echoing a real name of many female immigrant prostitutes from Ireland, but most alehouses and coffee houses had a room out back for already agreed gay men, where they could find the privacy they sought. Thus, Molly houses were used for rendezvous every night by 30 to 40 men, predominantly from working class. However, the regular gatherings were disliked by the society. Neither did the 18th century judicial system recognise homosexual relations regarding it as assault and punished with fine, confinement, pillory or hanging. The 18th century Old Bailey records describe 85 trials for sodomitical offences and 50 for blackmailing, notably recording the name of Charles Hitchen as [...] "under City Marshal, formerly a Cabinet-maker in St. Paul's Churchyard", who committed [...] "that detestable Sin of Sodomy". Hitchen was targeted by the Societies for the Reformation of Manners, while being a member of it, which performed a sweep of London attempting to root out [...] "sodomitical practices." ...|$|E
