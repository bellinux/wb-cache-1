5|$|Ancient Slavs {{developed}} {{a method of}} obtaining red dye from the larvae of the Polish <b>cochineal.</b> Despite the labor-intensive process of harvesting the <b>cochineal</b> and a relatively modest yield, the dye {{continued to be a}} highly sought-after commodity and a popular alternative to kermes throughout the Middle Ages until it was superseded by Mexican <b>cochineal</b> in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Some hemipterans {{are used}} to produce dyestuffs such as carmine (also called <b>cochineal).</b> The scale insect Dactylopius coccus {{produces}} the brilliant red-coloured carminic acid to deter predators. Up to 100,000 scale insects are {{needed to make a}} kilogram (2.2lbs) of <b>cochineal</b> dye.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} cheaper Mexican <b>cochineal</b> {{led to an}} abrupt slump in the Polish <b>cochineal</b> trade, and the 1540s saw a steep decline in {{quantities}} of the red dye exported from Poland. In 1547, Polish <b>cochineal</b> disappeared from the Poznań customs registry; a Volhynian clerk noted in 1566 that the dye no longer paid in Gdańsk. Perennial knawel plantations were replaced with cereal fields or pastures for raising cattle. Polish <b>cochineal,</b> which until then was mostly an export product, continued to be used locally by the peasants who collected it; it was employed not only for dyeing fabric {{but also as a}} vodka colorant, an ingredient in folk medicine, or even for decorative coloring of horses' tails.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cochineals</b> were {{of value}} to the pre-Columbian {{societies}} of the Andes region. Rulers of the Inca Empire stored supplies of the insects as a commodity, as {{they were the only}} source of red dye for clothing and other textiles. Red was the color of royalty among the Incas. After Spanish colonization of the Americas began, <b>cochineals</b> were shipped worldwide as a commercial product.|$|R

50|$|In general, <b>cochineals</b> are waxy gray insects, but {{the adult}} females turn bright red when crushed, {{due to their}} carminic acid content. Most species are covered in thin, sticky strands of wax; D. coccus lacks these. As in other scales, the tiny males have wings, and the larger females do not.|$|R

5|$|Polish <b>cochineal</b> {{was widely}} traded in Europe during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. In the 15th and 16th centuries, along with grain, timber, and salt, {{it was one}} of Poland's chief exports, mainly to {{southern}} Germany and northern Italy as well as to France, England, the Ottoman Empire, and Armenia. In Poland, the <b>cochineal</b> trade was mostly monopolized by Jewish merchants, who bought the dye from peasants in Red Ruthenia and other regions of Poland and Lithuania. The merchants shipped the dye to major Polish cities such as Kraków, Gdańsk (Danzig), and Poznań. From there, the merchandise was exported to wholesalers in Breslau (Wrocław), Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Augsburg, Venice, and other destinations. The Polish <b>cochineal</b> trade was a lucrative business for the intermediaries; according to Marcin of Urzędów (1595), one pound of Polish <b>cochineal</b> cost between four and five Venetian pounds. In terms of quantities, the trade reached its peak in the 1530s. In 1534, 1963 stones (about 30 metric tons) of the dye were sold in Poznań alone.|$|E
5|$|Cacti have {{a variety}} of uses: many species are used as {{ornamental}} plants, others are grown for fodder or forage, and others for food (particularly their fruit). <b>Cochineal</b> is the product of an insect that lives on some cacti.|$|E
25|$|To produce dye from <b>cochineals,</b> {{the insects}} are {{collected}} {{when they are}} around 90 days old. Harvesting the insects is labour-intensive, as they must be individually knocked, brushed, or picked from the cacti and placed into bags. The insects are gathered by small groups of collectors who sell them to local processors or exporters.|$|R

Tadpoles feed on algae, mosquito larvae, and other edible material that may be present in their nursery. Unlike other Phyllobates spp., P. terribilis tadpoles are somewhat versatile feeders.|$|R

The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate the mortality of Coccus viridis by Lecanicillium spp. on faces of the leaves, and branches of Coffea arabica. This work was conducted in greenhouse at UFV. The experiment was carried out from February 2005 to June 2006. Seeds of the lineage IAC 15 from the variety “Catuaí Vermelho” coffee (C. arabica) were used. The nutritive solution utilized was composed for 3. 0 mmol/L of N, 9. 0 mmol/L of K, 1. 0 mmol/L of P, 4. 0 mmol/L of Ca, 2. 1 mmol/L of S, 46 µmol/L of B, 0. 3 µmol/L of Cu, 60. 0 µmol/L of Fe, 2. 0 µmol/L of Mg, 0. 5 µmol/L of Mo e 36. 0 µmol/L of Mn. The <b>cochineals</b> were collected from coffee leaves in commercial crops from Viçosa, MG. These <b>cochineals</b> were maintained into cages in the greenhouse. The fungus was obtained of infected <b>cochineals</b> coming into these cages. The plants were infected with eight months of age. For {{the preparation of the}} treatments was infested <b>cochineals</b> no infected by the Lecanicillium spp. The densities of dead and living C. viridis in leaves and branches were evaluated with 0, 15, 30, 35, 45, 60 e 75 days after of the infestation. Variance analysis and the averages compared with the Scott-Knott test and simple linear regression analysis. Lecanicillium spp. caused mortality in all C. viridis stages. Generally speaking, the high mortality occurred in the third instar. In addition, the fungi caused high mortality in this insect in the abaxial faces of C. arabica...|$|R

5|$|With the {{partitions}} of Poland {{at the end}} of the 18th century, vast {{markets in}} Russia and Central Asia opened to Polish <b>cochineal,</b> which became an export product againthis time, to the East. In the 19th century, Bukhara, Uzbekistan, became the principal Polish <b>cochineal</b> trading center in Central Asia; from there the dye was shipped to Kashgar in Xinjiang, and Kabul and Herat in Afghanistan. It is possible that the Polish dye was used to manufacture some of the famous oriental rugs.|$|E
5|$|Dyestuffs {{including}} carmine (<b>cochineal),</b> shellac, and kermes {{have been}} made from the bodies of insects. In classical times, Tyrian purple was extracted from sea snails such as Stramonita haemastoma (Muricidae) for the clothing of royalty, as recorded by Aristotle and Pliny the Elder.|$|E
50|$|A {{prickly pear}} cactus, Opuntia monacantha, was {{introduced}} to southwest Madagascar in the late 18th century by the French colonialists, who used it as natural fence to protect military forts and gardens. The cactus quickly spread and found use as cattle feed by Antandroy pastoralists. In the early 20th century, <b>cochineals</b> were introduced as biological control for the plant that had become a nuisance; they rapidly eradicated most of the cacti. This was probably associated with famine among the Antandroy people, although some authors challenged the causal link between famine and cactus eradication. Today, several Opuntia species are again present mainly {{in the south of}} Madagascar, spreading into native vegetation in some areas.|$|R
50|$|The dried {{bodies of}} the female insects are roughly 12 to 16% carminic acid. The carmine {{obtained}} is a shade of crimson, and this can be turned different shades by adding metal ions or changing the pH; tin salts or acids produce a bright scarlet, while iron or alkaline compounds turn it a deep purple. The Salasacas of Ecuador still use this process to color their textiles, particularly a red woolen garment worn by women around the shoulders, which each woman personalizes by choosing a different shade of red. They collect <b>cochineals,</b> probably D. confusus, from the wild, press them into cakes, and use the dried cakes to dye the garments three at a time. One is left crimson, one is soaked in lemon juice to turn it scarlet, {{and the third is}} rubbed with wood ashes to turn it purple.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cochineals</b> live on cactus plants, {{especially}} prickly pears (Opuntia spp.), {{as well as}} Cylindropuntia and Grusonia species. One {{species was}} collected from Corynopuntia schottii. They gather in large clumps mainly in shady, sheltered areas on the cactus pads and feed on the sap. Some species also infest the cactus fruits, flowers, stems, and roots; they are often found on the roots during {{times of the year}} when they are less active. Females have three developmental stages (instars), and males have five. They reproduce continuously year-round, with up to six generations per year. Eggs hatch very soon after they are laid, sometimes within minutes, and probably even occasionally while they are still inside the female. D. tomentosus carries its eggs on its body in a mesh of fibers. The wax filaments are produced from setae on the juvenile insect's head. These webby filaments likely aid in dispersal of the insects by catching the wind.|$|R
5|$|The Polish <b>cochineal</b> {{lives on}} {{herbaceous}} plants growing in sandy and arid, infertile soils. Its primary host plant is the perennial knawel (Scleranthus perennis), {{but it has}} also been known to feed on plants of 20 other genera, including mouse-ear hawkweed (Hieracium pilosella), bladder campion (Silene inflata), velvet bent (Agrostis canina), Caragana, smooth rupturewort (Herniaria glabra), strawberry (Fragaria), and cinquefoil (Potentilla).|$|E
5|$|Until 1927, {{the exact}} shades of the {{national}} colors were not legally specified. In practice, the actual hue, particularly of red, depended {{on what kind of}} red dye was available. In pre-partition Poland, crimson, due to its high price, was a color associated with the rich and the privileged. It could be obtained from the domestically harvested Polish <b>cochineal,</b> although imported alternatives were also available: kermes from the Mediterranean Basin (hence karmazyn, the Polish name of the color) and Mexican <b>cochineal</b> after the discovery of the New World. Crimson was reserved for the nobility and considered a symbol of the aristocracy, so that karmazyn became synonymous with a magnate. A royal ban on wearing this color could be a form of punishment; in the 14th century, the Nałęcz clan of Greater Poland were forbidden to dress in crimson for their ancestors' complicity in the assassination of King Premislaus in 1296. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, due to the influence of French fashion, crimson was largely replaced with the cheaper amaranth.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, {{the female}} Polish <b>cochineal</b> lays {{approximately}} 600-700 eggs, encased {{with a white}} waxy ootheca, in the ground. When the larvae hatch in late August or early September, they do not leave the egg case but remain inside {{until the end of}} winter. In late March or early April, the larvae emerge from the ground to feed for a short time on the low-growing leaves of the host plant before returning underground to feed on the plant's roots. At this point, the larvae undergo ecdysis, shedding their exoskeletons together with their legs and antennae, and they encyst by forming outer protective coatings (cysts) within the root tissues.|$|E

The survey was conducted in areas of cultivated vegetables in the vicinity of the Supply Logistics Center of Pernambuco (CEASA) in Recife, the capital of Pernambuco State, in northeastern Brazil. Thirty-three farmers were interviewed, who mentioned 13 animals as pests. The most frequent animal cited as a pest that causes injuries to cultivated plants was the ant, and the most frequent ecological relation cited was <b>cochineals</b> that were described as “mold”. The techniques used to control undesired animals are related to the cultural identity of the farmers and the market, resulting in a predominantly utilitarian perception of natural resources...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} three terms {{denoting}} the colour ‘red’, viz. Armenian karmir, the obviously corresponding Sogdian word karmīr, and karmīl ‘scarlet’ {{found in the}} Hebrew Bible. It will first briefly discuss the etymology of these words (summarising an argument made elsewhere) and argue that the words in question represent a technical term for a red dye from Armenia produced by scale insects. We will then attempt to show that historical data and chemical analysis of extant historical textiles confirm the Armenian red as the relevant dye. Late Biblical Hebrew karmīl occurs only three times. All three attestations {{are found in the}} book 2 Chronicles, and refer to the construction of the temple, as in the passage 2 Chron. 3. 14 : ‣ wayyaʿaś ʾet-happāroket tǝkēlet wǝʾargāmān wǝkarmīl ūbūṣ wayyaʿal ʿālāyw kǝrūbīm “And he [= Solomon] made the veil [of the temple] of blue, and purple and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon. ” In the remaining parts of the Old Testament, the series of blue, purple and crimson or scarlet reoccurs repeatedly, but instead of karmīl there is the expression tōlaʿat šānī, containing the words tōleʿa / tōlaʿ ‘worm, maggot’ and šānī ‘crimson, scarlet’. This expression is reminiscent of French vermeil ‘scarlet’, which is derived from ver ‘worm’. Hebrew karmīl is thus likely a priori to be not a colour, but a technical term for a dye, made from certain scale insects or <b>cochineals</b> such as the one in Fig. 2. In fact, this has been suggested since long ago; and it has also generally been assumed that Hebrew karmīl is a loanword from an Indo-European language and ultimately derives from Proto-Indo- European *ku̯ṛ́mi- ‘worm, maggot’ (the protoform of, for instance, Lithuanian kirmìs, Sanskrit kṛ́mi-, etc.). Slavic words for ‘red’ such as Old Church Slavonic črŭmĭnĭ show the same line of derivation. More precisely, as established already by Delitzsch, the source of karmīl must be an Iranian word related to Persian kirm ‘worm’ and its derivative qirmiz ‘red’. karmīl would then {{be a member of the}} group of Iranian words that entered Hebrew via Aramaic, and which are comparatively frequent in the book 2 Chronicles...|$|R

Assim, este trabalho teve por objetivo estudar as relações entre o ataque de C. viridis e as perdas causadas por este inseto a C. arabica. Este trabalho foi conduzido em casa de vegetação na Universidade Federal de Viçosa. Foram utilizadas sementes da linhagem IAC 15 da variedade “Catuaí vermelho” de café (C. arabica). Para a confecção dos tratamentos esta praga foi criada em casa de vegetação separada do experimento. Os tratamentos foram: plantas infestadas e não infestadas por adultos e ninfas da cochonilha verde. As plantas foram nutridas com solução nutritiva. Durante 110 dias foram avaliados: números de adultos e de ninfas de primeiro, segundo e terceiro ínstares, área foliar, diâmetro do caule, altura das plantas em todas repetições. No final do experimento avaliou-se o peso das raízes, caule, folhas e total. Os pesos das raízes, matéria seca total, área foliar e diâmetro do caule de plantas não atacadas por C. viridis superaram em 1, 31; 1, 41; 1, 50 e 8, 93 vezes, respectivamente o peso de plantas atacadas. As variáveis selecionadas foram: diâmetro do caule (cm), área foliar (cm²), peso de raízes (g), ninfas, adultos e total das cochonilhas. Concluindo que a planta de C. arabica é afetada de forma diferente entre seus órgãos e que a ninfa de terceiro ínstar e adultos são as fases que mais causam danos a C. arabica.

5|$|The insect {{was once}} {{commonly}} {{found throughout the}} Palearctic and was recognised across Eurasia, from France and England to China, but it was mainly in Central Europe where it was common enough to make its industrial use economically viable.

40|$|This {{pilot study}} is about method {{development}} using FT-Raman supplemented with computational methods for analyzing dyes and lac pigments used in folk {{art and craft}} from Hälsingland, Sweden, during the 18 th and 19 th century. The study {{is part of an}} interdisciplinary four years long project funded by the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsrådet). Conservation scientists, chemists, physicists, conservators, art historians and ethnologists from different Swedish universities are collaborating to make a holistic approach and material characterization of wall paintings, painted wall-hangings, decorated wooden furniture and patterned textiles in Decorated Farmhouses of Hälsingland, UNESCO World Heritage since 2012. Spectroscopic methods combined with historic sources are used to understand the materials and the context and time when these artefacts were made. The interdisciplinary collaboration is essential and in this way, new and deeper knowledge of the paint, coatings, painting techniques and dyeing methods in the 18 th and 19 th century Swedish folk art and handicrafts can be obtained. The relevant research questions span over a wide range, for example about the existence and time frame of woad and turkish red dye. Suitable materials for characterization are for example clothing, which are often possible to date historically due embroidered monograms. Therefore, the material characterization of clothing dyes may shed light on the usage and distribution of various folk art techniques. In the pilot study we present different historic dyestuff such as safflower, <b>cochineals,</b> madder, turkish red, brazilwood, fustic, birch leaves, weld, turmeric, woad, indigo and indigo carmine - all common in Sweden during this period. The dye references were made according to old Swedish recipes. Different textile fibres - cotton, wool and linen/flax - were dyed. In addition various colouring matters - for example purpurin, alizarin, atranorin, orcein, myricetin, luteolin, quercetin, rhamnetin, emodin, crocin, curcummin, kaempferol, indigotin and indirubin - were tested to identify specific fingerprint regions for each dye. In order to assist the interpretation of the vibrational spectra of the samples, computational methods were performed. A typical case study is presented below: threads from an authentic textile, a blue skirt from early 19 th century Delsbo parish, were analyzed using FT-Raman spectroscopy. The spectra were then compared with reference spectra. The Raman spectrum of a blue colored linen warp thread is shown together with the spectrum of pure indigotin as a reference (Figure 1). Preliminary results indicate that we are able to identify the main peaks as originating from indigotin in addition background from the linen fibre, suggesting indigo as the dye. Woad was also a common dye during the 18 th and 19 th century in Sweden [1]. Different from indigo, woad may also contain kaempferol. The comparison with reference spectra however did not yield a match in the fingerprint regions of kaempferol at f. ex. 1188 cm- 1 and 1606 cm- 1 [2, 3]. Therefore we may exclude woad as an ingredient in the colouring dye of this specific piece of clothing. Historic sources from 18 th century usually mention woad as an additional ingredient in the indigo vat to catalyze and help the bacterial fermentation process [4, 5]. During 19 th century though, woad is more seldom mentioned as an ingredient and perhaps {{this is an example of}} a more modern indigo vat. Other preliminary results shows that almost all pure colouring matters and some of the dyed textile fibres are easy to analyze with FT-Raman. However, it is difficult to analyse red dyes with this method. Furthermore, wool sometimes complicates the analyses. Therefore, we will continue using FT-Raman analyses and the computational models, supplemented with other analytical methods such as SERS and field-free APCI-TOF MS. References [1] Linders, J.

5|$|While French {{innovations}} enriched {{the cuisine}} in many ways, not every innovation was favorable. Since the French {{introduction of the}} prickly pear cactus in the 18thcentury, the lifestyle of southern pastoralists became increasingly reliant on the plant to ensure food and water for their zebu as well as fruit and water for themselves {{during the dry season}} between July and December. However, in 1925, a French colonist wishing to eradicate the cactus on his property in the southwestern town of Toliara introduced the <b>cochineal,</b> an insect known to be a parasite of the plant. Within five years, nearly all the prickly pear cactus of southern Madagascar had been completely wiped out, sparking a massive famine from 1930–1931. Although these ethnic groups have since adapted in various ways, the famine period is commonly remembered as the time when their traditional lifestyle was ended by the arrival of foreigners on their land.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{complete}} control of the Firm, Morris took an increased interest {{in the process of}} textile dyeing and entered into a co-operative agreement with Thomas Wardle, a silk dyer who operated the Hencroft Works in Leek, Staffordshire. As a result, Morris would spend time with Wardle at his home on various occasions between summer 1875 and spring 1878. Deeming the colours to be of inferior quality, Morris rejected the chemical aniline dyes which were then predominant, instead emphasising the revival of organic dyes, such as indigo for blue, walnut shells and roots for brown, and <b>cochineal,</b> kermes, and madder for red. Living and working in this industrial environment, he gained a personal understanding of production and the lives of the proletariat, and was disgusted by the poor living conditions of workers and the pollution caused by industry; these factors greatly influenced his political views. After learning the skills of dyeing, in the late 1870s Morris turned his attention to weaving, experimenting with silk weaving at Queen's Square.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{some other}} red dyes {{obtained}} from scale insects, the red coloring is derived from carminic acid with traces of kermesic acid. The Polish <b>cochineal</b> carminic acid content is approximately 0.6% of the insect's dried body weight. The insects were harvested shortly before the female larvae reached maturity, i.e. in late June, usually around Saint John the Baptist's day (June 24), hence the dye's folk name, Saint John's blood. The harvesting process involved uprooting the host plant and picking the female larvae, averaging approximately ten insects from each plant. In Poland, including present-day Ukraine, and elsewhere in Europe, plantations were operated {{in order to deal}} with the high toll on the host plants. The larvae were killed with boiling water or vinegar and dried in the sun or in an oven, ground, and dissolved in sourdough or in light rye beer called kvass in order to remove fat. The extract could then be used for dyeing silk, wool, cotton, or linen. The dyeing process requires roughly 3-4oz of dye per pound (180-250g per kilogram) of silk and one pound of dye to color almost 20pounds (50g per kilogram) of wool.|$|E

Eleven cities conquered by Montezuma in the 15th century paid a yearly tribute of 2000 {{decorated}} cotton blankets and 40 bags of <b>cochineal</b> dye each. Production of <b>cochineal</b> is depicted in Codex Osuna. During the colonial period, the production of <b>cochineal</b> (grana fina) grew rapidly. Produced almost exclusively in Oaxaca by indigenous producers, <b>cochineal</b> became Mexico's second-most valued export after silver. Soon after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, it began to be exported to Spain, and by the 17th century was a commodity traded as far away as India. The dyestuff was consumed throughout Europe and was so highly prized, its price was regularly quoted on the London and Amsterdam Commodity Exchanges. In 1777, French botanist Nicolas-Joseph Thiéry de Menonville, presenting himself as a botanizing physician, smuggled the insects and pads of the Opuntia cactus to Saint Domingue. This particular collection failed to thrive and ultimately died out, leaving the Mexican monopoly intact. After the Mexican War of Independence in 1810–1821, the Mexican monopoly on <b>cochineal</b> came to an end. Large-scale production of <b>cochineal</b> emerged, especially in Guatemala and the Canary Islands; it was also cultivated in Spain and North Africa.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, <b>cochineal</b> {{was used}} for {{colouring}} fabrics. During the colonial period, {{with the introduction of}} sheep to Latin America, the use of <b>cochineal</b> increased, as it provided the most intense colour and it set more firmly on woolen garments than on clothes made of materials of pre-Hispanic origin such as cotton or agave and yucca fibers. In general, <b>cochineal</b> is more successful on protein-based animal fibres (including silk) than plant-based material. Once the European market discovered the qualities of this product, the demand for it increased dramatically. By the beginning of the 17th century, it was traded internationally. Carmine became strong competition for other colourants such as madder root, kermes, Polish <b>cochineal,</b> Armenian <b>cochineal,</b> brazilwood, and Tyrian purple, as they were used for dyeing the clothes of kings, nobles, and the clergy. For the past several centuries, it was the most important insect dye used in the production of hand-woven oriental rugs, almost completely displacing lac. It was also used for painting, handicrafts, and tapestries. Cochineal-coloured wool and cotton are important materials for Mexican folk art and crafts.|$|E
25|$|Development of {{chemical}} pigments and dyes helped bring new industrial prosperity to Germany {{and other countries}} in northern Europe, but it brought dissolution and decline elsewhere. In Spain's former New World empire, the production of <b>cochineal</b> colors employed thousands of low-paid workers. The Spanish monopoly on <b>cochineal</b> production had been worth a fortune until the early 19th century, when the Mexican War of Independence and other market changes disrupted production. Organic chemistry delivered the final blow for the <b>cochineal</b> color industry. When chemists created inexpensive substitutes for carmine, an industry {{and a way of}} life went into steep decline.|$|E
