40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study are to examine the influence of surplus free <b>cash</b> flow towards <b>earnings</b> management and the role of good corporate governance as well as the ownership structure in moderating the relationship between surplus free <b>cash</b> flow and <b>earnings</b> management. In this study, good corporate governance is proxied with audit quality and independent audit committee, while the ownership structure is proxied with institutional ownership and managerial ownership. Based on the partial least square (PLS) analysis towards 104 sample manufacturing companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2013 - 2014 selected using purposive sampling, it is found that surplus free cash flow has significant positive effect on earnings management. Meanwhile, the testing towards the 4 (four) moderating variables which is supposed to reduce the positive impact of surplus free cash flow towards the earning management concludes that institutional ownership is proven to reduce the impact of positive surplus of free <b>cash</b> flow toward <b>earnings</b> management. Managerial ownership variable is found to have significant positive effect on the relationship between surplus free <b>cash</b> flow and <b>earnings</b> management. The audit quality and independent audit committee, on the other hand, does not significantly influence the relationship between surplus free <b>cash</b> flow and <b>earnings</b> management. These findings indicate that the agency problem caused by surplus free cash flow will encourage management to do earnings management.

In analyzing cash flow response coefficient determinants, net income and the accounting rate of return are used as benchmarks for comparison with three <b>cash</b> flow <b>earnings</b> measures, <b>cash</b> flow from operations, cash recoveries, and the cash recovery rate. ^ Results indicate that economic growth is a cross-sectional determinant and the risk-free interest rate is an intertemporal determinant with net income as the earnings measure and to a lesser degree with cash flow from operations and <b>cash</b> recoveries as <b>earnings</b> measures. Tests for systematic risk and persistence as response coefficient determinants do not produce results consistent with the predicted signs with <b>cash</b> flow <b>earnings</b> measures nor with Collins and Kothari 2 ̆ 7 s previous results using net income as the earnings measure. Explanatory power is increased considerably when response coefficient determinant variables are added to the basic earnings/returns model for both net income and the two cash flow measures of cash from operations and cash recoveries.

40|$|Purpose - The main aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{earnings}} management behaviours, including both accrual-based and <b>cash</b> flow-based <b>earnings</b> management, of Chinese firms during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Design/methodology/approach - A data set of 1, 392 firm-year observations derived from a large sample of China&# 039;s top listed firms (based on total assets) was constructed and investigated via univariate and ordinary least squares regression analyses. Findings - Two distinct conclusions can be drawn from the results of the study. First, the top Chinese listed firms did engage in earnings management, as indicated by comparisons of the means of the absolute values of both accrual-based and <b>cash</b> flow-based <b>earnings</b> management indicators in the periods before and after 2008 when the GFC started. Second, investigation of earnings management directions revealed that in response to the GFC, the firms from construction-related industries and the airline industry manipulated earnings upwards through either accrual-based and/or <b>cash</b> flow-based <b>earnings</b> management activities. On the other hand, firms in the household durables industry engaged in earnings-reducing activities. These findings reflect the effect of the stimulus package launched by the Chinese Government in an effort to combat the GFC. In addition, the results indicate that firm characteristics such as size, leverage, profitability and growth affected the earnings management behaviours of the firms analysed in the study. Originality/value - The empirically derived findings of this study contribute to the literature pertaining to the effects of the GFC on earnings management practices in China, which has remained relatively scant to date...|$|R

The two victims, Pedro Gomez (25 or 35) and Juan Moreno (19), had been workmen sleeping on floor mattresses at a construction site, guarding against burglary, as a water heater had been recently stolen from the work site.
