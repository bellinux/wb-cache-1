5000|$|Base Stations {{typically}} have a flat surface—referred {{to as the}} Interface Surface—on top of which a user can place one or more Mobile Devices. There are two methods for aligning the transmitting coil (part of the Base Station) and receiving coil (part of the Mobile Device) {{in order for a}} power transfer to happen. In the first concept—called guided positioning—a user must place the Mobile Device on a certain location of the Base Station's surface. For this purpose, the Mobile Device provides an alignment aid that is appropriate to its size, shape and function. The second concept—referred to as free positioning—does not require the user to place the Mobile Device in direct alignment with the transmitting coil. There are several ways to achieve free positioning. In one example a bundle of transmitting coils is used to generate a magnetic field at the location of the receiving coil only. Another example uses mechanical means to move a single transmitting coil underneath the receiving coil. A third option is to use a technique called [...] "Multiple Cooperative Flux Generators."Figure 1-1 illustrates the basic system configuration. As shown, a power transmitter includes two main functional units—a power conversion unit and a communications and control unit. The diagram shows the transmitting <b>coil</b> (<b>array)</b> generating the magnetic field as part of the power conversion unit. The control and communications unit regulates the transferred power to the level that the power receiver requests. The diagram also demonstrates that a Base Station may contain numerous transmitters, allowing for multiple Mobile Devices to be placed on the same Base Station and inductively charge until each of its batteries are fully charged. Finally, the system unit in the diagram comprises all other functionality of the Base Station, such as input power provisioning, control of multiple power transmitters, and user interfacing.|$|E

40|$|Mutual {{coupling}} is {{an important}} issue in RF <b>coil</b> <b>array</b> design for MRI. In this study, the dependence of mutual coupling behavior among RF <b>coil</b> <b>array</b> elements on the tuning capacitor placement is specially investigated at different field strengths. For phased arrays with different tuning capacitor configurations, the degree of mutual coupling is estimated by measuring parameters S 11 and S 12 using Advanced Design System (ADS) simulation and bench measurements. The simulation agrees well with experiment results and shows that the mutual coupling behavior of different configurations varies notably with the resonant frequency. Specifically, at frequencies lower than 64 MHz, the placement of one or two concentrated capacitors suffers less mutual coupling than that of four evenly distributed capacitors around the coil loop; whereas at frequencies higher than 128 MHz, the opposite is observed.

Images were qualitatively analysed by two independent radiologists who graded the visibility of several anatomic structures from 1 = not visible to 5 = excellent.
