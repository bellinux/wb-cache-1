50|$|The idea {{to produce}} sugar in cube form {{came from his}} wife, who cut herself while paring down the {{standard}} large, commercial sugar loaf into smaller parts {{for use in the}} home. Rad had become involved with management of a sugar factory in 1840 (in Datschitz, present day Dačice, in Moravia, a part of the Habsburg empire). He began work on a machine for transforming sugar into cube form, leading to a five-year patent for the <b>cube</b> <b>press</b> he invented, granted on January 23, 1843.|$|R
40|$|During April 2015, {{in celebration}} of National Poetry Month, the James E. Brooks Library hosted a series of poetry {{readings}} featuring local poets. The readings were held in the library’s first floor Academic 2 ̆ 6 Research Commons. The series was arranged and the readings were introduced by Gerard Hogan, Instruction Librarian at the Brooks Library. On Wednesday, April 15 th, Xavier Cavazos and Katharine Whitcomb were the featured poets. Streaming audio {{of the program is}} available through Soundcloud here, or by clicking the link above. Xavier Cavazos is the author of Barbarian at the Gate, selected and introduced by Thomas Sayers Ellis as part of the Poetry Society of America’s New American Poets Chapbook Series and Diamond Grove Slave Tree, which was awarded the inaugural Prairie Seed Poetry Prize from Ice <b>Cube</b> <b>Press.</b> Cavazos teaches in the Central Washington Writing Project, Africana and Black Studies, and the Professional and Creative Writing Programs at Central Washington University. Katharine Whitcomb has degrees from Macalester College and Vermont College of Norwich University.

40|$|On the {{acclimatization}} of micropropagated Juglans plantlets, values fluctuating between 0 and 80 % {{of plant}} loss {{can be found}} in literature, but most studies prefer to ignore the problem. This research focuses on the Juglans hybrid ‘Paradox’ (Juglans regia × Juglans hindsii), exploiting new methodologies to minimize the failure rates on the acclimatization of in vitro rooted plantlets. Data for in vitro rooting and acclimatization are presented. Rockwool <b>cubes,</b> peat <b>pressed</b> pellets and Jiffy Preformas® were tested and compared with the traditional vermiculite moistened with the DKW nutrient solution added with Phytagel, commonly used on Juglans micropropagation protocols. These new approaches allowed the transfer of in vitro rooted plants to acclimatization with a balled-root protection, instead of the traditional bare-root procedure, significantly reducing the post-transplant stress. Information concerning plantlet/mycorrhiza association during acclimatization is also presented...|$|R
50|$|The {{owners and}} {{builders}} {{in the early}} days of Tower Grove East were for the most part siblings, cousins and extended family members of the prominent German Americans living in Compton Heights. Thus architectural trends originating in Compton Heights and Flora Place influenced the designs of homes on South Compton, Shenandoah and several of the other residential avenues. Like Tower Grove Heights, these residences were built on the four-square plan. The typical house is a pyramid or hipped roof on a two-story <b>cube.</b> Often, a <b>pressed</b> brick or limestone course separates the stories. The original developers then varied the theme through detail choices. Attention was heavily focused on the entry, cornice and windows. Buyers would often choose the architectural elements from pattern books that illustrated multiple styles of windows, doors, stairways and fireplace mantels. Thus the interiors of the homes in Tower Grove East are full of surprises. The often austere exterior facades typically hide a wealth of richly designed entries with carved fretwork; built-in hall benches, mirrors and bookcases; wood paneling; stained-glass windows and elaborate staircases.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of proactive complex engineering services (ProCES) in today's business environment, only limited {{attention has been given}} to their design and costing. This thesis proposes a framework for ProCES design planning and requirements that encompasses the whole service life cycle, that is, analysis and design planning, delivery planning, performance planning and adaptation planning. The important requirements for technical service design are identified. These are the commercial, technical and organisational aspects, as well as external and stakeholder involvement. This thesis also proposes a conceptual model for ProCES costing that considers non-routine services, risk, service life cycle, and equipment complexity. The cost model is based on time-driven, activity-based costing (TDABC) but it integrates TDABC with fuzzy logic to overcome challenges associated with equipment complexity, uncertainty, and data availability. This fuzzy-TDABC approach is applied successfully to estimate the service costs for different complex services (i. e. printing <b>press,</b> <b>cube</b> satellite, and ship loader services), demonstrating that it can deal with the complexity and dynamic behaviour of the particular equipment, system or process involved. Together, the design planning and requirements model and the cost model fill a gap in current industrial service research...|$|R
6000|$|We {{are further}} to {{consider}} concerning perception, that the ideas we receive by sensation are often, in grown people, altered by the judgment, without our taking notice of it. When we set {{before our eyes}} a round globe of any uniform colour, v.g. gold, alabaster, or jet, {{it is certain that}} the idea thereby imprinted on our mind is of a flat circle, variously shadowed, with several degrees of light and brightness coming to our eyes. But we having, by use, been accustomed to perceive what kind of appearance convex bodies are wont to make in us; what alterations are made in the reflections of light by the difference of the sensible figures of bodies;--the judgment presently, by an habitual custom, alters the appearances into their causes. So that from that which is truly variety of shadow or colour, collecting the figure, it makes it pass for a mark of figure, and frames to itself the perception of a convex figure and an uniform colour; when the idea we receive from thence is only a plane variously coloured, as is evident in painting. To which purpose I shall here insert a problem of that very ingenious and studious promoter of real knowledge, the learned and worthy Mr. Molineux, which he was pleased to send me in a letter some months since; and it is this:--"Suppose a man BORN blind, and now adult, and taught by his TOUCH to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the cube, which the sphere. Suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table, and the blind man be made to see: quaere, whether BY HIS SIGHT, BEFORE HE TOUCHED THEM, he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe, which the cube?" [...] To which the acute and judicious proposer answers, [...] "Not. For, though he has obtained the experience of how a globe, how a cube affects his touch, yet he has not yet obtained the experience, that what affects his touch so or so, must affect his sight so or so; or that a protuberant angle in the <b>cube,</b> that <b>pressed</b> his hand unequally, shall appear to his eye as it does in the cube."--I agree with this thinking gentleman, whom I am proud to call my friend, in his answer to this problem; and am of opinion that the blind man, at first sight, would not be able with certainty to say which was the globe, which the cube, whilst he only saw them; though he could unerringly name them by his touch, and certainly distinguish them by the difference of their figures felt. This I have set down, and leave with my reader, as an occasion for him to consider how much he may be beholden to experience, improvement, and acquired notions, where he thinks he had not the least use of, or help from them. And the rather, because this observing gentleman further adds, that [...] "having, upon the occasion of my book, proposed this to divers very ingenious men, he hardly ever met with one that at first gave the answer to it which he thinks true, till by hearing his reasons they were convinced." ...|$|R
