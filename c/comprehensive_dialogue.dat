Rajoelina criticized Ravalomanana for his absence and furthermore stated that the meetings he had held with Ravalomanana prior to that were disappointing. Odon Razanakolona, who had been mediating the talks, abandoned his role shortly before Rajoelina withdrew from the talks; according to Razanakolona, the talks were fruitless and deadlocked.|$|E

40|$|The 2016 Global Hunger Index Africa Edition is {{produced}} by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Concern Worldwide, and Welthungerhilfe in conjunction with NEPAD. The GHI Africa Edition is based on data taken from the 2016 Global Hunger Index. IFPRI has calculated the Global Hunger Index, a multidimensional measure of global hunger, for the past eleven years. The series tracks the state of hunger across the globe and spotlights those regions and countries where action to address hunger is most urgently needed. The GHI Africa Edition shows that although progress between countries varies, the level of hunger in all countries across the continent of Africa, for which GHI scores could be calculated, has declined since 2000. Despite this progress, the level of hunger in many countries remains unacceptably high. Of the 42 countries in Africa for which GHI scores could be calculated in this report, only three countries have scores that fall into the “low” hunger category, while 28 fall into the “serious” category and five countries have 2016 scores in the “alarming” category. It is clear that governments must now follow through on their promises with political will and commitment to action that is both strong and sustained. The root causes of hunger are complex and require multi-sectoral and multilevel collaboration. The role of national governments in achieving these goals by significantly enhancing the quality of implementation is also clear. Yet Zero Hunger can only be achieved when governments measure progress and are accountable to citizens, which requires capacities to collect and analyze data, combined with open and <b>comprehensive</b> review and <b>dialogue</b> processes.

All {{of them are}} working in different and important ways to understand {{the workings of the}} brain, the mysteries of the mind and to grasp that elusive concept called consciousness. Although they are all justified in forwarding their respective researches, it is also necessary to integrate these diverse appearing understandings and try and get a comprehensive perspective that is, hopefully, {{more than the sum of}} their parts. There is also the need to understand what each one is doing, and by the other, to understand each other&#x 2032;s basic and fundamental ideological and foundational underpinnings. This must be followed by a <b>comprehensive</b> and critical <b>dialogue</b> between the respective disciplines. Moreover, the concept of mind and consciousness in Indian thought needs careful delineation and critical/evidential enquiry to make it internationally relevant. The brain-mind dyad must be understood, with brain as the structural correlate of the mind, and mind as the functional correlate of the brain. To understand human experience, we need a triad of external environment, internal environment and a consciousness that makes sense of both. We need to evolve a consensus on the definition of consciousness, for which a working definition in the form of a Consciousness Tetrad of Default, Aware, Operational and Evolved Consciousness is presented. It is equally necessary to understand the connection between physical changes in the brain and mental operations, and thereby untangle and comprehend the lattice of mental operations.

40|$|This {{study is}} part of the European FP 7 ALIZ-E project. The goal of this project is to develop the theory and {{practice}} behind an embodied social robot that is capable of maintaining affective interactions with young users over an extended and possibly discontinuous period of time. The target audience of this research consists of young patients suffering from diabetes mellitus. In previous work on ALIZ-E, several activities have been developed that the user can carry out with the robot, such as playing a quiz, math game or imitation game. Research has shown that monitoring one’s diabetes by keeping a diary is beneficial to the child’s health on the short and long term. In this master thesis, we develop a new activity that allows a diabetic child to keep an online diabetes diary together with the robot. We evaluate this new activity by investigating the following research question: How can a robot contribute to the activity of keeping a web-based diary together with diabetic children? We present a <b>comprehensive</b> robot <b>dialogue</b> model that has two main foci: 1) supporting and motivating the child in the task of keeping a diary and 2) forming a bond between the child and the robot through personalized interaction. We tested the dialogue model by performing a pilot experiment in a real-world setting using a within-subjects design (N= 6). The subjects were diabetic {{children between the ages of}} 9 to 12. Over the course of eleven days, they kept an online diary in which they logged their blood glucose values, carbohydrate intake, insulin dosages, exercise, emotional well-being and their daily activities. Every other day the children remotely connected to the robot, which they believed to be autonomous, and performed this activity together. The robot provided explanations where necessary; asked the child relevant questions and shared personal information to establish a social bond. We measured adherence by comparing the frequency of diary entries and the diary content between the two conditions. Engagement was measured by observing the children’s participation and attention during the interactions. We used a questionnaire and observations made during the experiment as indicators for the development of a bond between the robot and the child. The results show that low diary adherence is a common problem among diabetic children. We showed that interacting with the robot while keeping a diary helped to improve adherence. Children had significantly more completed diary entries with the robot present than while the robot was absent. Overall, both the diary and the robot were rated quite positively. Children felt the robot supported them well in performing the task, and they thought the robot was friendly, trustworthy and human-like. The children openly shared information with the robot about their daily lives, and were very inquisitive about the robot’s life as well. This was also explicit in their diaries, where we found a significantly larger amount of information shared in the diaries on days with the robot. The children eventually came to see the robot as a friend. We need to be careful in saying the results we found are solely the result of our intervention. But we do think that using a robot can greatly enhance the pleasure of the activity and therefore the motivation of the child. Keeping a diary with the support from a robot can help the children take the next step in taking responsibility for their own self-management...|$|R
