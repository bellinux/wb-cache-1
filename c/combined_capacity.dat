5|$|Deserts are {{increasingly}} seen as sources for solar energy, {{partly due to}} low amounts of cloud cover. Many successful solar power plants have {{been built in the}} Mojave Desert. These plants have a <b>combined</b> <b>capacity</b> of 354 megawatts (MW) making them the largest solar power installation in the world. Large swaths of this desert are covered in mirrors, including nine fields of solar collectors. The Mojave Solar Park is currently under construction and will produce 280MW when completed.|$|E
5|$|Lake Bonney Wind Farm {{was built}} in three stages. Stage 1 {{consists}} of 46 turbines each having a rated capacity of 1.75 MW (total 80.5 MW) and was finished in March 2005. Construction of Stage 2 began in November 2006 and was finished around April 2008. Stage 2 consists of 53 turbines of 3 MW (total 159 MW). Stage 3 consists of 13 turbines of 3 MW (total 39 MW). The <b>combined</b> <b>capacity</b> of the three stages are 278.5 MW making it the biggest wind farm in Australia {{at the time of}} completion.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the stadium}} has four stands: the Tribune d'Honneur, the Tribune Pasages, the Tribune Populaire Nord, and the Tribune Populaire Sud. The four stands {{currently}} have a <b>combined</b> <b>capacity</b> of 10,898, with 1,324 of these being standing places. The stadium {{is typical of}} many continental European grounds, with an athletics track between the pitch and the stands. Next to the stadium {{there is a small}} annexed ground where the club's reserve and youth teams play their matches. The first televised match at the ground took place on 18 August 1987, when Saint-Étienne were beaten 2–1. The record attendance at the stadium was set on 24 October 1987, when 16,715 people saw Chamois Niortais defeat Marseille by two goals to one in a Division 1 encounter.|$|E
40|$|Studies of the {{relative}} <b>combining</b> <b>capacities</b> of different antisera to Vibrio cholerae and Shigella flexneri were carried out using the Talmage test. In this test the absorption of an I 131 labelled antibody preparation by antigen is blocked {{by the addition of}} unlabelled unknown serum. Sera from rabbits {{in the early stages of}} immunization ("early antisera") had a high agglutinin titer, but low <b>combining</b> <b>capacity.</b> Sera from hyperimmune rabbits ("late antisera") had higher <b>combining</b> <b>capacities</b> than early antisera, but similar or lower agglutinin titers. More antigen was needed to absorb the agglutinins from late antisera than from early ones of the same agglutinin titer, indicating that late antisera contained relatively more antibody. At high concentrations, sera from hyperimmune rabbits agglutinated the homologous antigen more rapidly than did early antisera, even though early sera had similar or higher agglutinin titers. Sera drawn after the anamnestic response to bacterial antigen had the characteristics of late sera; i. e., their <b>combining</b> <b>capacities</b> were high. The possible significance of these findings for the in vitro estimation of protective antibody is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Electromotive force {{measurements}} of cells without liquid junction, {{of the type}} Ag, AgCl, HCl + protein, H 2, have been made at 30 °C. with the proteins gelatin, edestin, and casein in 0. 1 M hydrochloric acid. The data {{are consistent with the}} assumptions of a constant <b>combining</b> <b>capacity</b> of each protein for hydrogen ion, no combination with chloride ion, and Failey's principle of a linear variation of the logarithm of the mean activity coefficient of the acid with increasing protein concentration. The <b>combining</b> <b>capacities</b> for hydrogen ion so obtained are 13. 4 x 10 – 4 for edestin, 9. 6 x 10 – 4 for gelatin, and 8. 0 x 10 – 4 for casein, in equivalents of combined H+ per gm. of protein...|$|R
5|$|Construction of the B Station began {{shortly after}} the A station was completed. The {{stations}} were built during {{a period in which}} there were great advances in power station technology, and in the scale of production, which led to them having a variety of intermediate generator set sizes along with a mix of design styles. Blyth A had a generating capacity of 480megawatts (MW) and the B Station 1,250MW. Their <b>combined</b> <b>capacity</b> of 1,730MW briefly made Blyth Power Station the largest electricity generation site in England, until Ferrybridge C Power Station came into full operation in 1966. The stations were capable of generating enough electricity to power 300,000homes.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, the {{nameplate}} {{capacity of a}} photovoltaic power stations is rated in megawatt-peak (MWp), which refers to the solar array's DC power output. However, Canada, Japan, Spain and {{some parts of the}} United States often specify using the converted lower nominal power output in MWAC; a measure directly comparable to other forms of power generation. A third and less common rating is the mega volt-amperes (MVA). Most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least 1MWp. As at the start of 2017, the world's largest operating photovoltaic power station has a capacity of over 800 megawatts and projects up to 1 gigawatt are planned. As at the end of 2016, about 4,300 projects with a <b>combined</b> <b>capacity</b> of 96GWAC were solar farms larger than 4MWAC.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{solar power plants}} in the Mojave Desert which supply power to the {{electricity}} grid. Insolation (solar radiation) in the Mojave Desert is among the best available in the United States, and some significant population centers {{are located in the}} area. These plants can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) is the name given to nine solar power plants in the Mojave Desert which were built in the 1980s, the first commercial solar plant. These plants have a <b>combined</b> <b>capacity</b> of 354 megawatts (MW) which made them the largest solar power installation in the world, until Ivanpah Solar Power Facility was finished in 2014.|$|E
40|$|Previous studies (1 - 4) on {{pneumonia}} virus of mice (PVM) {{have shown}} that the virus combines either with erythrocytes or with lung particles obtained from species susceptible to infection with the agent but not with other tissues. Moreover, it has been demonstrated (1 - 5) that, unlike influenza (6), mumps (7), and Newcastle disease (8) viruses, spontaneous dissociation from the combined state does not occur with PVM. Release of the virus from combination can be achieved by heat (1 - 3) or treatment with alkali (5) but either procedure destroys the infectivity of the virus, as well as the <b>combining</b> <b>capacity</b> of the tissue component, although neither demonstrably alters the <b>combining</b> <b>capacity</b> of the virus itself. In the course of the present investigation a technique was developed by means of which dissociation of PVM from the combined state can be accomplished without destroying either the infectivity of the virus, the <b>combining</b> <b>capacity</b> of the virus, or the <b>combining</b> <b>capacity</b> of the tissue component. This technique provided a means suitable for a study of some of the factors which influence virus-tissue component combinations. In the present investigation the effects of electrolyte concentration, ionic composition, and pH, as well as virus concentration upon combination have been studied. It will be shown that dissociation of PVM from the combined state is strikingly dependent upon electrolyte concentration and pH; that the effect of electrolytes upon combination between the virus and tissue components is independent of their ionic composition but is dependent upon their concentration; that with respect to combination there is an inverse relationship between virus concentration and electrolyte concentration. In addition, it will be shown that the reactions between influenza viruses and erythrocytes also are strikingly influenced by the ionic environment and certain of the similarities and differences between the reactions of PVM and the influenza viruses with erythrocytes will be presented...|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of a lined channel from Poondi to Tamaraipakkam for a length of 15 km. to convey water from Poondi to Tamaraipakkam was completed in 1972 to reduce the transmission loss.
