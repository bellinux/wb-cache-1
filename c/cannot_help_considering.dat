60|$|I am better a {{great deal}} than I was last week, and have been allowed by Dr. Chambers to come downstairs again, and occupy my old place on the sofa. My health remains, however, in what I <b>cannot</b> <b>help</b> <b>considering</b> myself, and in what, I believe, Dr. Chambers considers, a very {{precarious}} state, and my weakness increases, of course, under the remedies which successive attacks render necessary. Dr. Chambers deserves my confidence--and besides the skill with which he has met the different modifications of the complaint, I am grateful {{to him for a}} feeling and a sympathy which are certainly rare in such of his profession as have their attention diverted, as his must be, by an immense practice, to fifty objects in a day. But, notwithstanding all, one breath of the east wind undoes whatever he labours to do. It is well to look up and remember that in the eternal reality these second causes are no causes at all.|$|E
6000|$|I {{hope this}} letter may arrive {{time enough to}} answer its purpose. I <b>cannot</b> <b>help</b> <b>considering</b> myself as having been placed in a very ridiculous light by the gentlemen who have remarked, answered, and rejoined {{concerning}} my [...] "Monody on Chatterton". I {{have not seen the}} compositions of my competitors (unless indeed the exquisite poem of Warton's, entitled [...] "The Suicide", refer to this subject), but this I know, that my own is a very poor one. It was a school exercise, somewhat altered; {{and it would have been}} omitted in the last edition of my poems but for the request of my friend Mr. Cottle, whose property those poems are. If it be not in your intention to exhibit my name on any future month, you will accept my best thanks, and not publish this letter. But if Crito and the Alphabet-men should continue to communicate on this subject, and you should think it proper for reasons best known to yourself to publish their communications, then I depend on your kindness for the insertion of my letter; by which it is possible those your correspondents may be induced to expend their remarks, whether panegyrical or vituperative, on nobler game than on a poem which was, in truth, the first effort of a young man, all whose poems a candid critic will only consider as first efforts.|$|E
60|$|Thank you, my dear Mr. Kenyon, for the Camden Society books, {{and also}} for these which I return; {{and also for}} the hope of seeing you, which I kept through yesterday. I honor Mrs. Coleridge for the {{readiness}} of reasoning and integrity in reasoning, for the learning, energy, and impartiality which she has brought to her purpose, and I agree with her in many of her objects; and disagree, by opposing her opponents with a fuller front than she is always inclined to do. In truth, I can never see anything in these sacramental ordinances except a prospective sign in one (Baptism), and a memorial sign in the other, the Lord's Supper, and could not recognise either under any modification as a peculiar instrument of grace, mystery, or the like. The tendencies we have towards making mysteries of God's simplicities are as marked and sure as our missing the actual mystery upon occasion. God's love is the true mystery, and the sacraments are only too simple for us to understand. So you see I have read the book in spite of prophecies. After all I should like to cut it in two--it {{would be better for}} being shorter--and it might be clearer also. There is, in fact, some dullness and perplexity--a few passages which are, to my impression, contradictory of the general purpose--something which is not generous, about nonconformity--and what I <b>cannot</b> <b>help</b> <b>considering</b> a superfluous tenderness for Puseyism. Moreover she is certainly wrong in imagining that the ante-Nicene fathers did not as a body teach regeneration by baptism--even Gregory Nazianzen, the most spiritual of many, did, and in the fourth century. But, after all, as a work of theological controversy it is very un-bitter and well-poised, gentle, and modest, and as the work of a woman you must admire it and we be proud of it--that remains certain at last.|$|E
40|$|For my dad, whose secret {{ambition}} {{has always}} been to be a physicist, for my mum, for being the strong woman that she is, and of course, for my husband, for always being here. ivv Acknowledgments Looking back at the five years I have spent in Caltech {{as a part of the}} Institute of Quantum Information (IQI), I <b>cannot</b> <b>help</b> but <b>consider</b> myself incredibly fortunate to have had guidance from so many people. The first person I have to thank is of course my advisor John Preskill. He has put together the amazing place that is IQI, with its constant flux of visitors, postdocs and students, offering me an invaluable chance to meet so many talented people in the field. Along with sharing his insights in physics and always extending a willing hand in times of difficulty, he taught me a most valuabl...|$|R
40|$|The {{greatest}} {{obstacle to}} developing a string phenomenology is our {{lack of understanding of}} the ground state. We explain why the dynamics which determines this state {{is not likely to be}} accessible to any systematic approximation. We note that the racetrack scheme, often cited as a counterexample, suffers from similar difficulties. We stress that the weakness of the gauge couplings, the gauge hierarchy, and coupling unification suggest that it may be possible to extract some information in a systematic approximation. We review the ideas of Kahler stabilization, an attempt to reconcile these facts. We consider whether the system is likely to sit at extremes of the moduli space, as in recent proposals for a low string scale. Finally we discuss the idea of Maximally Enhanced Symmetry, a hypothesis which is technically natural, compatible with basic facts about cosmology, and potentially predictive. 1 In thinking of Yukawa’s great work, one <b>cannot</b> <b>help</b> but <b>consider</b> the importance of asking th...|$|R
40|$|The Government in Rome from 88 - 82 B. C. is a {{politically}} important period to students of Roman History, {{since it is}} the only period when the Democratic Party was in complete control of affairs. Toe traditional picture of these years ~ writers, both modern and ancient, is one bespattered with the blood of proscriptions, the hunger and filth of economic distress and poverty. In general, complete and utter maladministration. However 1 after a careful study of extant sources, one <b>cannot</b> <b>help</b> but <b>consider</b> the writers somewhat biased in their opinions. This thesis is an effort to point out and assist readers in visualizing what Rome was like during those years. The aim is to alter the prevalent opinion, bringing those years into clearer focus and into their proper perspective. T'M purpose is not to prove that the men of the times like Cinna, Garbo, Flaccus, and Marius were merely much maligned individuals whose good intentions have since been lost in the brilliant rhetoric of Cicero, or in the invective of Velleius but rather that their government was an honest effort towards the betterment of the underprivileged classes, even though 'they themselves may have been anxiously working towards the solidification of their somewhat precarious positions as demagogues.

60|$|Perhaps the reader, whom I <b>cannot</b> <b>help</b> <b>considering</b> as {{my guest}} in the Old Manse, and {{entitled}} to all courtesy {{in the way}} of sight-showing,--perhaps he will choose to take a nearer view of the memorable spot. We stand now on the river's brink. It may well be called the Concord,--the river of peace and quietness; for it is certainly the most unexcitable and sluggish stream that ever loitered imperceptibly towards its eternity,--the sea. Positively I had lived three weeks beside it before it grew quite clear to my perception which way the current flowed. It never has a vivacious aspect, except when a northwestern breeze is vexing its surface on a sunshiny day. From the incurable indolence of its nature, the stream is happily incapable of becoming the slave of human ingenuity, as is the fate of so many a wild, free mountain torrent. While all things else are compelled to subserve some useful purpose, it idles its sluggish life away in lazy liberty, without turning a solitary spindle or affording even water-power enough to grind the corn that grows upon its banks. The torpor of its movement allows it nowhere a bright, pebbly shore, nor so much as a narrow strip of glistening sand, in any part of its course. It slumbers between broad prairies, kissing the long meadow grass, and bathes the overhanging boughs of elder-bushes and willows, or the roots of elms and ash-trees and clumps of maples. Flags and rushes grow along its plashy shore; the yellow water-lily spreads its broad, flat leaves on the margin; and the fragrant white pond-lily abounds, generally selecting a position just so far from the river's brink that it cannot be grasped save at the hazard of plunging in.|$|E
5000|$|Serge's libertarian {{tendency}} {{made him}} doubt {{the ability of}} the Soviet Union and any other state to utilize an ideology, no matter how scientific, without it being simultaneously utilized in the repression of free thought: I do not, after all my reflection on the subject, cast any doubt upon the scientific spirit of Marxism, nor on its contribution, a blend of rationality and idealism, to the consciousness of our age. All the same, I <b>cannot</b> <b>help</b> <b>considering</b> as a positive disaster the fact that a Marxist orthodoxy should, in a great country in the throes of social transformation, have taken over the apparatus of power. Whatever may be the scientific value of a doctrine, from the moment that it becomes governmental, interests of State will cease to allow it the possibility of impartial inquiry; and its scientific certitude will even lead it first to intrude into education, and then, by the methods of guided thought, which is the same as suppressed thought, to exempt itself from criticism. The relationships between error and true understanding are in any case too abstruse for anyone to presume to regulate them by authority... Our great Marxists of Russia, nurtured on Science, would not admit any doubt concerning the dialectical conception of Nature- which is, however, no more than a hypothesis, and one difficult to sustain at that.|$|E
50|$|The Cur Dog is a trusty {{and useful}} servant to the farmer and grazier; and, {{although}} it is not taken notice of by naturalists as a distinct race, yet it is now so generally used, especially in the North of England, and such great attention is paid in breeding it, that we <b>cannot</b> <b>help</b> <b>considering</b> it as a permanent kind. They are chiefly employed in driving cattle; in which way they are extremely useful. They are larger, stronger, and fiercer than the Shepherd's Dog; and their hair is smoother and shorter. They are mostly black and white colour. Their ears are half-pricked; {{and many of them are}} whelped with short tails, which seem as if they had been cut: These are called Self-tailed Dogs. They bite very keenly; and as they always make their attack at the heels, the cattle have no defence against them: In this way they are more than a match for a Bull, which they quickly compel to run. Their sagacity is uncommonly great. They know their master's fields, and are singularly attentive to the cattle that are in them: A good Dog watches, goes his rounds; and, if any strange cattle should happen to appear amongst the herd, although unbidden, he quickly flies at them, and with keen bites obliges them to depart.|$|E
