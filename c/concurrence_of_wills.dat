50|$|The will {{theory of}} {{contract}} postulates an extremely subjective approach to contract, whereby consensus {{is the only}} basis for contractual liability. The upshot is that, {{if there is no}} genuine <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>wills,</b> there can be no contract. It is generally agreed, though, that unqualified adherence to this theory would produce results both unfair and economically disastrous.|$|E

In this context it is important to show the differences between labour-law relationship and commercial-law relationship, as well as to look at <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> duties in the past. An amendment to the Commercial Code made performance of the business management in the framework of parallel labour-law relationship possible, but the recodification of Civil Law that shall come into effect as of January 1, 2014 does not take <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> duties into consideration. One of the most important parts <b>of</b> this thesis <b>will</b> be thus looking for an answer to the question, what the situation regarding <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> duties <b>will</b> be in the future. The second crucial problem, that this thesis is focused on, is issue <b>of</b> <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> the powers to act on behalf of the company, i. e. if a member of the Board of Directors is entitled to act even as a contractual or legal representative of a company.

5000|$|Civil law systems {{take the}} {{approach}} that an exchange of promises, or a <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>wills</b> alone, rather than an exchange in valuable rights is the correct basis. So if A promises to give B a book, and B accepts the offer without giving anything in return, B would have a legal right to the book and A could not change her mind about giving it to B as a gift. However, in common law systems the concept of culpa in contrahendo, a form of estoppel, is increasingly used to create obligations during pre-contractual negotiations. Estoppel is an equitable doctrine that provides {{for the creation of}} legal obligations if a party has given another an [...] and the other has relied on the assurance to his detriment.|$|E
60|$|There {{is another}} notion current, pretty closely allied to the former; that {{perfection}} is the constituent cause of beauty. This opinion {{has been made}} to extend much further than to sensible objects. But in these, so far is perfection, considered as such, from being the cause of beauty; that this quality, where it is highest, in the female sex, almost always carries with it an idea of weakness and imperfection. Women are very sensible of this; for which reason they learn to lisp, to totter in their walk, to counterfeit weakness, and even sickness. In all this they are guided by nature. Beauty in distress is much the most affecting beauty. Blushing has little less power; and modesty in general, which is a tacit allowance of imperfection, is itself considered as an amiable quality, and certainly heightens every other that is so. I know it is in every body's mouth, that we ought to love perfection. This is to me a sufficient proof, {{that it is not the}} proper object of love. Who ever said we ought to love a fine woman, or even any of these beautiful animals which please us? Here to be affected, there is no need <b>of</b> the <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> our <b>will.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we review}} the {{investigation}} for the light-matter interaction between surface plasmon field in metal nanoparticle (MNP) and the excitons in semiconductor quantum dots (SQDs) in hybrid SQD-MNP system under the full quantum description. The exciton-plasmon interaction {{gives rise to}} the modified decay rate and the exciton energy shift which are related to the exciton energy by using a quantum transformation method. We illustrate the responses of the hybrid SQD-MNP system to external field, and reveal Fano effect shown in the absorption spectrum. We demonstrate quantum entanglement between two SQD mediated by surface plasmon field. In the absence of a laser field, <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> quantum entanglement <b>will</b> disappear after a few ns. If the laser field is present, the steady states appear, so that quantum entanglement produced will reach a steady-state entanglement. Because one of all optical pathways to induce Fano effect refers to the generation of quantum entangled states, It is shown that the <b>concurrence</b> <b>of</b> quantum entanglement can be obtained by observation for Fano effect. In a hybrid system including two MNP and a SQD, because the two Fano quantum interference processes share a segment of all optical pathways, there is correlation between the Fano effects of the two MNP. The investigations for the light-matter interaction in hybrid SQD-MNP system can pave the way {{for the development of the}} optical processing devices and quantum information based on the exciton-plasmon interaction...|$|R
