2500|$|Eventually Maddock was {{installed}} in his own drawing office within the Cooper building, although it was somewhat cramped, being located beneath the works stores. Initially, Maddock's duties revolved around drawing or redrawing existing components and developing refinements on the existing Cooper 500 and 1000 cars. However, in 1953 Maddock was instrumental in introducing two design features that became Cooper trademarks {{for the rest of}} the decade: the curved-tube <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> and the [...] "curly leaf" [...] leaf spring location bracket. The car that both of these design innovations were pioneered on was the Mark VIII version of the Cooper 500 Formula Three machine.|$|E
2500|$|The Hornet, {{introduced}} for the 1951 model year, {{was based}} on Hudson's [...] "step-down" [...] design that was first seen in the 1948 model year on the Commodore. The design merged body and <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> into a single structure, with the floor pan recessed between the car's chassis rails instead of {{sitting on top of}} them. Thus one [...] "stepped down" [...] into a Hudson. The step-down chassis's [...] "lower center of gravity...was both functional and stylish. The car not only handled well, but treated its six passengers to a sumptuous ride. The low-slung look also had a sleekness about it that was accentuated by the nearly enclosed rear wheels." ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>chassis,</b> <b>frame,</b> or basket, is {{designed}} to be rigid, avoiding deformation that could change critical alignments with the magnet gap, perhaps causing the voice coil to rub against the sides of the gap. Chassis are typically cast from aluminum alloy, or stamped from thin steel sheet, though in some drivers with large magnets cast chassis are preferable as sheet metal can easily be warped in whenever the loudspeaker is subjected to rough handling. Other materials such as molded plastic and damped plastic compound baskets are becoming common, especially for inexpensive, low-mass drivers. [...] Metallic chassis can {{play an important role in}} conducting heat away from the voice coil; heating during operation changes resistance, causes physical dimensional changes, and if extreme, may even demagnetize permanent magnets.|$|E

2500|$|The 1 Ton 109inch was {{produced}} from 1968 to 1977, covering late IIA and series III Models. It {{was basically a}} Series IIB Forward Control built with a standard 109in body, featuring 2.6-litre petrol engine, lower ratio gearbox, ENV front and rear axles, (Salisbury front and rear on later Series IIIs) though some late IIAs were fitted with ENV axles in front and Salisbury on the rear. Later series IIIs had a Rover type front axle with uprated differential. The <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> was unique to the model and featured drop-shackle suspension similar to the military series Land Rovers. 900x16 tyres were a standard feature and these machines were commonly used by utility companies and breakdown/recovery firms. [...] Only 170 IIA and 238 Series IIIs (1 Ton) were built for the home market. Export markets had even fewer examples, making {{this one of the}} rarest types of Land-Rover ever built.|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{immediately}} the T43 design {{was replaced by}} the Mark III version of the [...] "Formula Two" [...] chassis. Maddock and the Coopers upgraded the existing design by switching the front suspension for an improved double wishbone suspension arrangement with coilover shock absorbers, in place of the older cars' transverse leaf spring design. New step-up gears in the transaxle allowed Maddock to lower the engine (now including Climax's stretched [...] FPF in the works Formula One car), reducing the centre of gravity of the new Cooper T45 (Mark III) by mounting the dry-sump engine much lower. Maddock credited this particular innovation to Jack Brabham, who received the suggestion from his Australian friend, Ron Tauranac. Brabham and Cooper contributed other detail improvements, but Maddock left the fundamental <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> virtually unaltered from the T43. The T45 was immediately successful. In the hands of Maurice Trintignant, Rob Walker's new T45 won the very next World Championship round, the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix.|$|E

50|$|Typically the {{material}} {{used to construct}} vehicle <b>chassis</b> and <b>frames</b> is carbon steel; or aluminum alloys to achieve a more light-weight construction.

By 1934, they had developed the Citroën Traction Avant, the first unibody, pressed-steel automobile. In order to hold all this steel together, Budd also pioneered the use of arc welding in automobile manufacturing.|$|R

50|$|For engineering, {{the rear}} kickup on the <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> was {{eliminated}} by {{the adoption of}} a 'banjo' frame. Unlike contemporary practice, the rear axle was placed through large openings {{on both sides of the}} frame, with rubber snubbers to absorb any shock if the car axle should make contact. This in turn permitted a wider body. To help lower the car, the rear springs were mounted on the outer sides of the <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> and not under the frame. This idea was eventually copied by other manufacturers - Chrysler, for example, in 1957.|$|E
50|$|The <b>chassis</b> <b>frame</b> has an {{underframe}} {{designed to}} make {{a unit of the}} engine and gearbox both of which are supported by it along the full length of both their sides. Suspension is by semi-elliptic springs all round. At the rear universal-jointed radius rods tie the rear-axle casing to the <b>chassis</b> <b>frame.</b> A triangular torque rod held at its front end by a spring buffer resists the reaction of driving and braking. Internal expanding brakes are fitted to the rear wheels together with an external hinged shoe brake behind the gear box.|$|E
40|$|A {{historical}} {{review is}} made of the methods adopted in vehicle design. This {{is divided into two}} sections, vehicles with <b>chassis</b> <b>frames</b> and integral structures. Complete solutions have been obtained for all types of <b>chassis</b> <b>frames</b> by Erz and the results of this work are given. The simple frame structural analysis has been extended for buses, with semi-integral and integral construction. Private car structural analysis has been very approximate using pencil and paper method 4 various approaches have been tried with little success. The advent of the digital computer has made the analysis of such complex structures possible and the two basic methods of ‘displacements’ and 'force’ are described. The matrix force method due to Argyris is treated in detail with a complete analysis of a simplified box van structure under idealised loading. This method has been chosen for economy in computer space and its application to a more complex structure, an integral Land Rover, is indicated. With the advent of very large computers it is probable that displacement methods will, take precedence as less work in 'choosing' the idealisation and redundant systems is involved...|$|R
50|$|Tank {{container}} chassis, {{also referred}} to as tank <b>chassis,</b> drop <b>frame</b> <b>chassis</b> or tank trailers, are a form of intermodal transportation for portable bulk liquid containers or ISO tank containers. They are characteristically longer and have lower deck height ideal for transporting constantly shifting payloads. The invention of the tank container revolutionized the way bulk liquids were transported, stored, and handled worldwide. It has improved safety, reduced costs and brought with it the benefits of convenience and efficiency associated with a multi-modal transport system. Invariably the invention of the drop <b>frame</b> <b>chassis</b> followed soon after to accommodate this new type of intermodal container.|$|R
