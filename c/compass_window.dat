50|$|A {{bow window}} or <b>compass</b> <b>window</b> is a curved bay window. Bow windows are {{designed}} to create space by projecting beyond the exterior wall of a building, {{and to provide a}} wider view of the garden or street outside and typically combine four or more casement windows, which join together to form an arch.|$|E
50|$|In carpentry, architecture, and shipbuilding, {{a compass}} is a curve (or bent) {{circular}} form. A compass plane is {{a plane that}} is convex, length-ways, on the underside, for smoothing the concave faces of curved woodwork. A compass saw is a narrow-bladed saw that cuts a curve. A compass timber is a curved (or crooked) timber, sometimes used in shipbuilding. A compass brick is a curved brick. A compass wall is a curved wall. A <b>compass</b> <b>window</b> is a circular bay window (or oriel window).|$|E
50|$|Merchant’s Hope has {{the best}} {{preserved}} compass windows of surviving colonial churches and displays the eventual style of chancel windows universal in eighteenth century Virginia churches. Although they show systematic repairs, they are “very old” and “surely colonial”. They consist of identically sized windows on the north, east, and south walls. There are four windows on the north, two in the east, and three on the south. The vestry door is directly opposite the north-eastern window. On the west wall above the door is a small <b>compass</b> <b>window.</b> The brick embellishment {{is the same as}} the west doorway with rubbed brick, queen closers, and a curved arch. They have two vertical sections made up of 24 over 16 panes. They are true guillotine windows with no counterweights. The wood work on the windows, like the west doorway, is a reverse S-curve, and the muntins are one inch thick. The bottoms consist of wooden sills with a row of beveled bricks below them in oarlock orientation.|$|E

5000|$|The church {{building}} was abandoned in 1806 after {{the construction of}} another Episcopal church in Petersburg when the Town of Blandford in [...] Prince George County was absorbed by Petersburg. Necessary repairs for its preservation {{were made by the}} City of Petersburg in 1882. The church originally had clear glass <b>compass</b> <b>windows</b> but after more than 75 years of abandonment and neglect the windows and doors were long gone. As part of the restoration project, the Ladies' Memorial Association solicited funds from each former Confederate state for the creation and installation of a stained glass window in memory of the Confederate soldiers from that state. Louis Comfort Tiffany's studio was commissioned to design the fifteen memorial <b>compass</b> <b>windows.</b> Each of the large windows contains the image of a Saint and symbols associated with the Saint. The four smaller windows were designed to complement the larger ones.|$|R
5000|$|The bricks {{are laid}} in Flemish bond {{both in the}} water table and the walls and show {{occasional}} use of glazed brick in both headers and stretchers. The walls are 22" [...] thick. Queen closers and rubbed brick are present at the corners, <b>compass</b> <b>windows,</b> and doorways. The transition from the water table to the walls is via an ovolo, or convex, molded brick. It is a large, deep church as already stated, approaching the limit of audibility in its 83-foot length. The modillion cornice, large toothed decorated eaves, are probably of colonial origin.|$|R
5000|$|The 8’ 8” tall {{windows are}} of typical compass style with round arches of voussiors, rubbed brick, and queen closers. There are {{fourteen}} <b>compass</b> <b>windows</b> in all. These windows, {{located on the}} south, east, and north are identical, while the two windows on the west wall are small rectangular openings with flat arches, characteristic of openings for galleries in other churches. There is no evidence for a western gallery in this church (as in its sister church, Lamb's Creek, that lacks the western windows entirely). The doorways are most likely not the original form: the church probably had classical pediments like Pohick Church or Lamb's Creek Church as evidenced by brick repairs surrounding the doors. The original door openings were approximately 6' 7" [...] wide, and the southern entrance was probably the main one. The doorways themselves are also not of colonial age.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a church}} of late construction, begun in 1773 and {{completed}} in 1776, having {{characteristics of a}} rectangular church combined with the contemporary, two story churches of Northern Virginia that stretch in a geographic swath from Falls Church to St. Paul's, King George County. It retains elements such as orientation, south and west doorways, <b>compass</b> <b>windows,</b> and Flemish bond, yet includes elements such as a deep church configuration, a hipped roof, movement of southern door {{to the center of}} the southern wall, classical door pediments, and a pulpit on the northern wall opposite the southern doorway. It lacks elements of deep churches in Northern Virginia such as two tiered windows and cruciform structure. The general doorway plan and placement of the pulpit is remarkably similar to that of Lamb’s Creek Church, designed by the same architect, and resembles several extant middle colony meeting houses.|$|R
6000|$|Disko's face relaxed. His {{skill and}} honour were {{involved}} in the march he had stolen {{on the rest of the}} fleet, and he had his reputation as a master artist who knew the Banks blindfold. [...] "Sixty, mebbe--ef I'm any judge," [...] he replied, with a glance at the tiny <b>compass</b> in the <b>window</b> of the house.|$|R
50|$|The 1849 {{pipe organ}} was {{installed}} by the Garret House Organ Company of Buffalo. This was replaced in 1966 by an organ given by architect Ralph Calder {{in memory of}} his wife, Helen. In 2007, D. F. Pilzecker & Company installed an organ with 78 ranks of pipes to replace the 1966 instrument. The stained glass windows were created by the J&R Lamb Studios of New York City in 1955. The rose window on the west facade was a gift of the Browning family, in memory of their mother Bertie Ann Browning. Replicating a ship's <b>compass,</b> the <b>window</b> is an appropriate tribute inasmuch as the Browning family was associated with shipping on the Great Lakes through the Browning Steamship Co. and owned the Bob-Lo Boats and Bob-Lo Island. The windows on the side walls contain scenes {{from the history of}} Detroit and the Bible.|$|R
