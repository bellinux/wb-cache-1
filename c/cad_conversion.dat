She was widened; her self-unloading machinery was totally replaced; she had dust suppression equipment installed. The changes resulted in a modest increase in her maximum capacity for most cargoes, but reduced her capacity for carrying coal. On 1 March 2015, after her conversion, she was rechristened CSL Tadoussac, instead of merely Tadoussac.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: For {{a surface}} {{mounting}} machine (SMM) in {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) assembly line, there are four problems, e. g. <b>CAD</b> data <b>conversion,</b> nozzle selection, feeder assignment and placement sequence determination. A hierarchical planning for them to maximize the throughput rate of an SMM is presented here. To minimize set-up time, a <b>CAD</b> data <b>conversion</b> system was first applied that could automatically generate the data for machine placement from CAD design data files. Then an effective nozzle selection approach was implemented to minimize the time of nozzle changing. And then, to minimize picking time, an algorithm for feeder assignment was used to make picking multiple components simultaneously as much as possible. Finally, in order to shorten pick-and-place time, a heuristic algorithm {{was used to determine}} optimal component placement sequence according to the decided feeder positions. Experiments were conducted on a four head SMM. The experimental results were used to analyse the assembly line performance...|$|R
40|$|Inspecting large {{industrial}} plants {{in a virtual}} walkthrough environment {{has proven to be}} a valuable tool in Plant Design. Many CG techniques, such as various LOD and culling methods, have been developed to visualize complex models in VR environments. These techniques decide solely based on geometric properties how to optimize the scene. In this paper we introduce the concept of semantically controlled selection of those techniques and show how semantic considerations can enhance the <b>CAD</b> to VR <b>conversion</b> process for large model visualization (LMV) walkthroughs of Plant Design models, improving the performance and adapting the visualization to the users' needs. A taxonomy, together with semantic considerations coming from the relationship between user, model, and resources is the basis to decide which rules should be applied for a specific visualization technique. By extending a LMV walkthrough system we are able to reduce the complexity of {{large industrial}} plant models by a factor of two...|$|R
40|$|Layered {{manufacturing}} (LM) machines use stereolithography (STL) {{files to}} build parts by creating continuous slices {{on top of}} each other. An STL file approximates the surface of a part with planar triangles. This results in geometric errors being introduced in the part surface during the <b>conversion</b> from the <b>CAD</b> model to the STL file format, which in turn leads to errors in the LM manufactured part. CAD packages have built-in export options to reduce this <b>CAD</b> to STL <b>conversion</b> error. However, this is applied to the entire part geometry which leads to an increase in the file size and pre-processing time in LM machines. This paper presents a new approach to locally reduce this CAD to STL translation error. This approach, referred to as vertex translation algorithm (VTA), compares an STL facet to its corresponding CAD surface, computes the chordal error at multiple points on the STL surface, and translates the point with the maximum chordal error until it lies on the design surface. This translation results in the reduction of the chordal error locally without unnecessarily increasing the size of the STL file. In addition, a facet isolation algorithm (FIA) has also been developed and presented in this paper. This isolation algorithm extracts the STL facets corresponding to the surfaces and features of the part that have to be modified by the translation algorithm. The VTA is applied in conjunction with the FIA on a sample service part to reduce the form and profile error of critical feature...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{different}} aspects of converting an engineering drawing to CAD, 3 -D reconstruction from several views has only been dealt with from a geometric perspective, although {{a lot of information}} is of symbolic nature and can be recognized as such directly on a single view. In this paper, we present a first prototype of a system combining geometric reconstruction through the "fleshing out projections" paradigm with symbolic recognition and matching. KEYWORDS engineering drawings, 3 -D reconstruction, fleshing out projections, <b>CAD</b> <b>conversion</b> 1 Introduction At the previous ICDAR [5], we proposed an agenda for achieving real conversion of mechanical engineering drawings to 3 -D CAD representations. The different points which we mentioned as having to be worked on were: ffl primitive recognition, i. e. enhancing the existing state-of-the-art methodologies and development of additional tools for extracting geometric primitives; ffl syntax-based annotation analysis and layer separation, to [...] ...|$|E
40|$|CAD systems offer {{typically}} some visualization {{tools to}} {{have a better understanding of}} the model. Although these possibilities have evolved considerably, even providing 3 D interactive inspection of the models in Virtual Reality (VR), many CAD systems still lack of good performance in this matter, especially when Large Models are considered. This kind of conversion from CAD format to VR typically considers two factors: the modell (size, structure, complexity [...] .) and the resources (memory, processor, graphics [...] .). Thus, a key factor is usually forgotten: the user. User knowledge can bring semantics to the process, and allow a better Large Model Visualization (LMV) for this purpose. In this paper we explain how semantics can help in the <b>CAD</b> <b>conversion</b> for LMV, and improve the performance of visualization in environments with restricted resources. We propose a semantic-based parametric control of the conversion process to manage how different visualization techniques are applied for a specific model...|$|E
40|$|Impellers {{are used}} in various {{mechanical}} applications and they usually operate under severe conditions. Very often a replacement of an impeller is required after certain operation hours due to material failure. Since it is a critical and expensive spare part, accurate manufacturing, following the design requirements of the part, is necessary. In order to avoid any dimensional manufacturing defects, quality control procedures are used based on reverse engineering. The aim of the current paper was to evaluate the overall accuracy of the reverse engineering procedure, when a laser scanner is used for digital data capturing. The specified accuracy of the laser scanner was of ± 0. 084 mm and the scanned data were converted to a Computer Aided Design (CAD) file using commercial design software. In order to assess {{the accuracy of the}} laser scanning and the <b>CAD</b> <b>conversion</b> procedure, a highly accurate coordinate measuring machine was used with a touch trigger probe and specified accuracy of ± 0. 006 mm. The results have shown that the deviation produced by the laser scanning and the associated reverse engineering methodology was up to 1 mm, mostly observed {{at the edges of the}} freeform surfaces. It was concluded that such large deviations are caused from the inaccuracy of the laser scanner, possible errors created by the mesh – polygonal model creation, but most importantly from the errors when creating the B-splines...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of the conversion from azathioprine (AZA) to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) followed by calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) elimination or minimization in patients with progressive chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD). Methods. Between November 6, 1999 and February 12, 2003, 169 patients receiving CNI/AZA/prednisone (153 CsA; 14 tacrolimus) were included in this study. Demographics, immunosuppression, graft function, hematology, and biochemistry were obtained before (- 6, - 3, and - 1 month) and 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after and at last follow-up visit after conversion. Results. Mean age was 34 +/- 12 years, 66 % males, 51 % Caucasian, and 72 % living allograft recipients. Mean follow-up times before and after conversion were 32. 4 and 19. 4 months; 10 patients completed 3 years of follow-up. CNI elimination was performed in 39 % and minimization in 61 % of patients. Overall there was significantly improved graft function at I year after conversion (2. 6 +/- 1. 0 vs 2. 1 +/- 0. 6 mg/dL, P =. 038). the slopes of the regression lines of 1 /Cr vs time were significantly improved from preconversion to after conversion (- 0. 026 vs + 0. 007 mg(- 1) /dL per day(- 1), P =. 001). There was a significant decrease in mean systolic (141 +/- 21 vs 135 +/- 22 mm Hg, P =. 015) and diastolic (89 +/- 15 vs 84 +/- 14 rum Hg, P =. 005) blood pressure values at 1 year. There were four episodes of acute rejection (Banff IA) treated with steroids. Three years after conversion, patient and graft survivals were 95 % and 79 %, respectively. One patient developed posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. Conclusion. Among patients with <b>CAD,</b> <b>conversion</b> from AZA to MMF followed by CNI minimization or elimination was a safe and effective strategy to preserve or improve graft function.
