40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the influence of uncertainties associated with the material properties on the seismic performance of pile-supported wharves. For this purpose a two-dimensional finite difference model, representing typical pile-supported wharf structures from western United States has been constructed using software FLAC 2 D. Incremental dynamic analysis has been applied to evaluate the response of wharf structure under different levels of seismic loading. The uncertainties at both structural and geotechnical parameters have been investigated using a tornado diagram and a Ô¨Årst-Order Second-Moment (FOSM) analysis. It has been found that the uncertainties at the dead load of structure, friction angle <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> and the porosity <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> contribute most to the variability of the displacement ductility factor of the pile-supported wharf structures.

40|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>fills</b> {{that hit}} the seabed will remold the {{underlying}} material. If this material is a clay with sufficiently low shear strength, it will adopt rheological properties, causing flow through the <b>rock</b> <b>fill,</b> and contributing to the initial settlements <b>of</b> the <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> in addition to conventional consolidation theory. The settlements <b>of</b> the <b>rocks</b> depend upon the height <b>of</b> the <b>rock</b> <b>fill</b> and how the rocks have been laid out. This {{is due to the}} viscosity of the clay, and the fact that clay is thixotropic. Thixotropy causes the viscosity to increase with decreased shear rate. The settlements finally come to a stop due to frictional forces from the surface area <b>of</b> the <b>rocks.</b> Clay is a non-newtonian Bingham fluid and will have a laminar flow through the <b>rock</b> <b>fill.</b> The Kozeny-Carman model is the most appropriate model for determining the permeability with laminar fluid flow through porous media.
