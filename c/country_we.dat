Guerrero is the author of In the <b>Country</b> <b>We</b> Love: My Family Divided, a memoir about her parents being detained and deported when she was fourteen.|$|E
5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the <b>country.</b> <b>We</b> got written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper aims at {{assessing}} {{the nature of}} foreign direct investment (FDI) in transition <b>countries.</b> <b>We</b> provide an empirical application of the knowledge-capital model of multinationals (MNEs) to an original panel of a ¢ liates of MNEs in seven transition <b>countries.</b> <b>We</b> succeed in proving that the strategies of MNEs are heterogeneous by looking at FDI ‡ows by sectors of activity and by source <b>countries.</b> <b>We</b> …nd evidence for both horizontal and vertical FDI in the region, while current studies detect only the vertical ones. Therefore, we argue that transition countries start being attractive for foreign investors {{not only because of}} their low labor costs, but also because of their market potential...|$|R

25|$|The {{issue of}} climate change is one that we ignore at our own peril. There may still be {{disputes}} about exactly how much is naturally occurring, but what we can be scientifically certain of is that our continued use of fossil fuels is pushing us {{to a point of}} no return. And unless we free ourselves from a dependence on these fossil fuels and chart a new course on energy in this <b>country,</b> <b>we</b> are condemning future generations to global catastrophe.|$|E
25|$|The {{working men}} have no <b>country.</b> <b>We</b> cannot take from {{them what they}} have not got. Since the proletariat must first of all acquire {{political}} supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word. National differences and antagonism between peoples are daily more and more vanishing, owing {{to the development of}} the bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world market, to uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto. The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster. United action, of the leading civilised countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.|$|E
40|$|Background: Migration {{of health}} {{professionals}} from low and {{middle income countries}} to rich countries is a large scale and long-standing phenomenon, which is detrimental to the health systems in the donor <b>countries.</b> <b>We</b> sought to explore the extent of psychiatric migration.

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 November, the ICRC convoy reached Vukovar, only to be stopped at a bridge near the hospital. An {{armoured}} vehicle blocked access to the bridge leading to the hospital, and a JNA officer at the scene, Major Veselin Šljivančanin, refused to let the ICRC pass. In order to facilitate negotiations with the ICRC at the scene, BBC reporter Martin Bell volunteered his interpreter. In a confrontation recorded by television cameras, Šljivančanin told the ICRC personnel: [...] "This is my <b>country,</b> <b>we</b> have conquered this. This is Yugoslavia, and I am in command here!" [...] The ECMM personnel that {{had arrived at the}} Zidine junction to meet the returning convoy were informed by the JNA that the evacuees would instead be turned over to them in Bosanski Šamac, in northern Bosnia, on 22 November. While Šljivančanin held back the convoy, the prisoners were smuggled out of the hospital in buses in another direction. In total, approximately 300 people were taken away from the hospital.|$|E

The Indiatimes, in an article titled, [...] "Five wise men set for a Chak De act" [...] also argued, [...] "It looks like Indian hockey has done a real Chak de this time around". In addition, former hockey player Aslam Sher Khan, who was appointed by the Indian Olympic Association to head a committee which will replace the IHF, pointed to the film as a model to work towards. He stated in an interview, [...] "We {{have to make a}} Team India as you have seen in Bollywood blockbuster Chak De! India.

He is encased in self satisfied assurance of his own mental superiority." [...] In his speech at the Lyceum Hall, Treatt warned of Australia's attitudes on its success: [...] "A sort of mental haze seems to obscure the vision splendid that lies before this <b>country.</b> <b>We</b> are proud of being a British country, a country with British traditions, institutions, and all those things which go to make up what we call our 'British heritage.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Onn Ja'afar {{proposed}} to open UMNO membership to all Malayans, and renaming it the United Malayan National Organisation, {{which would have}} diluted its identity {{as a champion of}} ketuanan Melayu. Defeated in an internal power struggle, he resigned in 1951 to found the Independence of Malaya Party (IMP). He was succeeded by Tunku Abdul Rahman (often known as [...] "the Tunku"), who insisted on initial Malay sovereignty. Expressing concern over a lack of loyalty to Malaya among non-Malays, he demanded they clarify their allegiance before being accorded citizenship, going on to state: [...] "For those who love and feel they owe undivided loyalty to this <b>country,</b> <b>we</b> will welcome them as Malayans. They must truly be Malayans, and they will have the same rights and privileges as the Malays." [...] Not long after, in 1952, however, he appeared to contradict himself, and insisted that Malays safeguard their special position: [...] "Malaya is for the Malays and it should not be governed by a mixture of races." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson opposes {{federal and}} state gun control {{legislation}}, saying: [...] "I'm {{a firm believer in}} the Second Amendment and so I would not have signed legislation banning assault weapons or automatic weapons." [...] Johnson says that the Second Amendment [...] "was designed to protect us against a government that could be very intrusive. And in this <b>country,</b> <b>we</b> have a growing police state - if people can own assault rifles or automatic rifles, I think leads to a more civil government." [...] Johnson would, however, limit weapons such as rocket launchers. Johnson believes that allowing concealed carrying of guns reduces crime and gun violence. He opposes barring gun sales to individuals on the no-fly list, because he claims that such lists have a high error rate. Johnson has called for a [...] "thousand-person taskforce" [...] or [...] "hot line" [...] to prevent terrorists from obtaining guns, and has questioned why the perpetrator of the Orlando nightclub shooting was not [...] "deprived of his guns" [...] after being interviewed three times.|$|E
