5|$|As with {{cultural}} studies, media {{study is a}} distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, literary criticism and <b>critical</b> <b>theory.</b> Though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms {{is not in the}} remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing factors, such as ideological effects and audience reception, stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{also made}} {{a variety of other}} {{contributions}} in economic history, as well as economic theory and methodology. Weber's analysis of modernity and rationalisation significantly influenced the <b>critical</b> <b>theory</b> associated with the Frankfurt School. After the First World War, Max Weber was among the founders of the liberal German Democratic Party. He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in parliament and served as advisor to the committee that drafted the ill-fated democratic Weimar Constitution of 1919. After contracting Spanish flu, he died of pneumonia in 1920, aged 56.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s French sociologists, {{particularly}} {{those interested in}} <b>critical</b> <b>theory,</b> re-examined this historical legacy. The Annales School conducted extensive research into how order was maintained in pre-revolutionary France, focusing on {{the operation of the}} police, concepts of deviancy and religion. Histories of the Bastille since then have focused on the prison's role in policing, censorship and popular culture, in particular how these impacted on the working classes. Research in West Germany during the 1980s examined the cultural interpretation of the Bastille against the wider context of the French Revolution; Hanse Lüsebrink and Rolf Reichardt's work, explaining how the Bastille came to be regarded as a symbol of despotism, was among the most prominent. This body of work influenced historian Simon Schama's 1989 book on the Revolution, which incorporated cultural interpretation of the Bastille with a controversial critique of the violence surrounding the storming of the Bastille. The Bibliothèque nationale de France held a major exhibition on the legacy of the Bastille between 2010 and 2011, resulting in a substantial edited volume summarising the current academic perspectives on the fortress.|$|E
5|$|The first {{sociology}} {{department to}} be established in the United Kingdom was at the London School of Economics and Political Science (home of the British Journal of Sociology) in 1904. Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse and Edvard Westermarck became the lecturers in the discipline at the University of London in 1907. Harriet Martineau, an English translator of Comte, has been cited as the first female sociologist. In 1909 the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie (German Sociological Association) was founded by Ferdinand Tönnies and Max Weber, among others. Weber established the first department in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 1919, having presented an influential new antipositivist sociology. In 1920, Florian Znaniecki set up the first department in Poland. The Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt (later to become the Frankfurt School of <b>critical</b> <b>theory)</b> was founded in 1923. International co-operation in sociology began in 1893, when René Worms founded the , an institution later eclipsed by the much larger International Sociological Association (ISA), founded in 1949.|$|E

40|$|This {{literature}} review presents {{a bridge between}} current use of <b>critical</b> <b>theories</b> in student affairs and contemporary political critiques of higher education. <b>Critical</b> <b>theories</b> in student affairs {{have been used in}} professional philosophy statements, student development theories, as well as new works of research exploring student experiences and campus practices. Particularly, <b>Critical</b> Race <b>Theory</b> (CRT), feminisms, and queer theory are salient in a number of works using <b>critical</b> <b>theories</b> in student affairs. Applications of <b>critical</b> <b>theories</b> in student affairs do not include a thorough interrogation of the political economic environment surrounding higher education and its relevant implications. Academic capitalism has been used to understand how shifting political conditions have encouraged universities to move closer to the market by taking part in market and market-like activities. Themes in research around emerging Academy-Industry Relations (AIRs) and their impacts present a number of patterns relevant to student affairs practice. Application of the themes in academic capitalism results {{in a number of areas}} for future consideration including equity and access to higher education, responsibility of student affairs professionals to navigate changing political climates, and a pressing need for philosophical examination of professional practice and relevance within the current political context of higher education...|$|R

More substantively it addresses the extent of which technology is autonomous and how much force it has in determining human practice or social structure. <b>Critical</b> <b>theories</b> of technology often take a descriptive theory as their basis and articulate concerns, examining what way the relationship can be changed. The authors mentioned in this article are those that have some concern with technology or media, though they often borrow from one another and of course build upon seminal theorists that preceded them.|$|R
