50|$|Miller in 1910 {{designed}} {{a device that}} prevented cars from rolling backward down the lift hill {{in the event of}} pull chain breakage. It attached to the track and clicked onto the rungs of the chain. Known as the safety <b>chain</b> <b>dog,</b> or safety ratchet, it evolved into the device on the underside of cars that makes that distinctive clinkety-clank sound of wooden coasters.|$|E

The launch dog is {{normally}} retracted and is {{held in place by}} a small magnet, but the launch area has electrical contacts that demagnetize the magnet and cause the launch dog to drop down. The launch dog drops down at an angle, similar to the <b>chain</b> <b>dog</b> that a lifted coaster uses to connect to the lift chain.|$|E

50|$|Lift hills usually {{propel the}} train {{to the top of}} the ride via one of two methods: a chain lift {{involving}} a long, continuous chain which trains hook on to and are carried to the top; or a drive tire system in which multiple motorized tires (known as friction wheels) push the train upwards. A typical chain lift consists of a heavy piece of metal called a <b>chain</b> <b>dog,</b> which is mounted onto the underside of one of the cars which make up the train. This is in place to line up with the chain on the lift hill.|$|E
50|$|The cable lift {{utilizes}} a {{cable loop}} {{in place of}} the traditional chain, which is attached to a short section of chain that engages the trains <b>chain</b> <b>dog.</b> Because a cable is much lighter than a chain, cable lifts are much faster than chain lifts and can be used on much steeper hills - even vertical. A cable also requires far less maintenance than a chain. Another advantage to park guests is that a cable lift is very quiet, partly because the main drive winch is located directly beneath the top of the lift, a location which will normally be relatively far from guest-accessible areas.|$|E
50|$|Abyss, {{not happy}} with the loss, {{attacked}} Raven on the following Impact!, and got Raven's old nemesis, James Mitchell as Abyss's new manager. After weeks of attacks, Raven attempted to gain revenge on Abyss in a Steel <b>Chain</b> <b>Dog</b> Collar match under No Surrender rules at No Surrender with the Championship on the line. In the end, Raven pinned Abyss to retain the title. Abyss was not happy, and showed it by attacking Lance Hoyt on the following Impact, setting up a match at Sacrifice. Abyss defeated Hoyt at the event, and during the main event, attacked Sabu. With the war beginning, Abyss and Sabu met in a No Disqualification match at Unbreakable, with Abyss defeating Sabu. They battled again at Bound for Glory in the Monster's Ball II match that also involved Jeff Hardy and Rhino, with Rhino winning the encounter. During the match, Jeff Hardy gave Abyss a Swanton Bomb through a table from approximately 22 ft 0in. Abyss and Sabu continued to fight, leading to another No Disqualification match at Genesis, with Abyss again defeating Sabu. Due to interference from Sabu, Abyss lost to Jeff Hardy on the November 26, 2005 episode of Impact. A Barbed Wire Massacre match at Turning Point ended the feud. The match was voted TNA's 2005 Match of the Year. In the end, Sabu won the contest, getting his first pinfall over Abyss.|$|E

His heavy, square face bore distinct traces of the fatigue endured in the past twenty-four hours on horseback or in jolting market waggons.

50|$|The chain {{travels through}} a steel trough, and is {{normally}} powered {{by one or}} more motors which are positioned under the lift hill. <b>Chain</b> <b>dogs</b> underneath each train are engaged by the chain and the train is pulled up the lift. Anti-rollback dogs engage a rack (ratcheted track) alongside the chain to prevent the train from descending the lift hill. At the crest of the lift, the chain wraps around a gear wheel where it begins its return {{to the bottom of the}} lift; the train is continually pulled along until gravity takes over and it accelerates downhill. The spring-loaded <b>chain</b> and anti-rollback <b>dogs</b> will disengage themselves as this occurs.|$|R
40|$|We present here {{a suicide}} therapy against {{malignant}} gliomas {{based on the}} transfer to tumor cells of a gene encoding a B-glucosidase, linamarase (lis), which {{in the presence of}} the innocuous substrate linamarin (lin) produces cyanide, blocking the mitochondrial respiratory <b>chain.</b> <b>Dog</b> glioma cells carrying the lis gene are thus sensitive to lin (IC 50 of 250 Mg/mL at 48 hours) and cell death is accompanied by mitochondrial fission and ATP depletion. The combination of lis /lin with an otherwise nontoxic level of glucose oxidase (GO) enhances the therapeutic potential (IC 50 of 50 Mg/mL at 48 hours). GO produces hydrogen peroxide, inducing oxidative damage and increasing cellular stress. We show here the antitumoral effect of the lis /lin/GO therapy in a canine glioma cell line and in a xenograft glioma model in nude mice. The synergic combination causes mitochondrial membrane depolarization and phosphatidylserine externalization and accelerates death by 48 hours. The lethal process is caspase independent; poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 is not implicated; and there is no apoptosis-inducing factor translocation to the nucleus. The combined system induces autophagic cell death that can be rescued by 3 -methyladenine and is characterized by the presence of double-membrane vesicles and punctate LC- 3 pattern.

60|$|Verily of an unearthly {{stock was}} this white hare, for upon its {{approach}} and {{long before it}} neared a village, the <b>chained</b> <b>dogs,</b> by some strange instinct conscious of its coming, trembled in terror, and frantically endeavoured to snap their bonds; unfastened ones fled no man knew whither; and if one happened to be trotting alongside its belated master as he trudged homeward and chanced to meet the ghastly Dobbie with its blood-red eyes, with a scream of pain almost human in its keen intensity, away home scampered the terrified animal, madly dashing over hedge and ditch as though bewitched and fiend-chased.|$|R
5000|$|West {{was also}} known for his {{opposition}} to <b>chaining</b> <b>dogs.</b> He maintained that chaining is inherently cruel to the dogs and endangers human beings because chained animals are exceptionally aggressive. [...] "Chaining" [...] means tying up the dog to an object such as a tree, a stake, or a parking meter. West’s anti-chaining bill contained a section stating that a dangerous dog should be tied up no longer than is necessary to protect the safety of human beings. As passed, however, the law prohibits the restraint of a dog to a permanent object at night, or in bad weather conditions, or within 500 feet of a school.|$|R

Thebe, Alexander's wife and cousin (or half-sister, as the daughter of Jason of Pherae), concealed her three brothers in the house during the day, had the dog removed when Alexander had gone to rest, and, having covered the steps of the ladder with wool, brought up the young men to her husband's chamber. Though she had taken away Alexander's sword, they feared to set about the deed until she threatened to wake him. Her brothers then entered and killed Alexander. His body was cast into the streets, and exposed to every indignity.|$|R
