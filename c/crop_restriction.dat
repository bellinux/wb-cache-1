40|$|The {{overall goal}} {{of this study was}} to analyse the welfare effect of {{improved}} wastewater treatment with the view of making policy recommendations for sustainable urban and peri-urban irrigation agriculture in Kenya. This goal was achieved by investigating three specific objectives. The first objective was to assess the farmers’ awareness of health risks in urban and peri-urban wastewater irrigation. Second objective was to analyse the factors that affect the choice of low-risk adaptations in reuse of untreated wastewater for irrigation. The third objective was to estimate the value that urban and peri-urban farmers who practice wastewater irrigation impute to improvements in specific characteristics of the wastewater input in agriculture. In order to achieve the first objective, an ordered probit model was used to identify the factors that influence farmers’ awareness of health risks in untreated wastewater irrigation. The model was fitted to data collected from a cross-sectional survey of 317 urban farm households in the Kibera informal settlement of Kenya. Results of this study show that gender of household head, household size, education level of household head, farm size, ownership of the farm, membership to farmers’ group, and market access for the fresh produce significantly affect awareness of farmers about health risks in wastewater irrigation. Therefore, there is need for awareness programs to promote public education through regular training and local workshops on wastewater reuse in order to improve the human capital of the urban and peri-urban farmers. To achieve the second objective, the study used a multinomial logit model to analyse the farmers’ choice of low-risk adaptations in untreated wastewater irrigation. A survey of 317 urban and peri-urban farmers was conducted and measures for risk-reduction in wastewater reuse were analysed. The urban and peri-urban farmers were found to have adopted low-risk wastewater irrigation techniques such as cessation of irrigation before harvesting, <b>crop</b> <b>restriction</b> and safer application methods. Results of the study show that adoption of risk-reduction measures is significantly influenced by the following factors: household size, age of the household head, education of household head, access to extension, access to media, access to credit, farmers’ group membership, and risk awareness. Also, marginal analysis of the coefficients confirmed the socio-economic characteristics are key determinants in adoption of low-risk measures in wastewater reuse. The study recommends that policies in support of low-risk urban and peri-urban irrigation agriculture should disaggregate farmers according to their socio-economic and institutional characteristics in order to achieve their intended objectives. To achieve the third objective, the study employed the discrete choice experiment approach to estimate the benefits farmers impute to improvements in attributes of the wastewater irrigation input, whose aim is to reduce the health risks associated with untreated wastewater irrigation. Urban and peri-urban farmers who practice wastewater irrigation drawn from Motoine-Ngong River in Nairobi were randomly selected for the study. A total of 241 farmers completed the presented choice cards for the choice model estimation. A random parameter logit model was used to estimate the individual level willingness to pay for wastewater treatment. The results show that urban and peri-urban farmers are willing to pay significant monthly municipality taxes for treatment of wastewater. Conclusion of this study was that, quality of treated wastewater, quantity of treated wastewater and the riverine ecosystem restoration are significant factors of preference over policy alternative designs in wastewater treatment and reuse.

While previous simulation studies applied smaller isolation distances (40 to 50 m), our research question was whether the conservative nature of isolation distances in Germany constitutes limitations to GM maize cropping. We investigated a variety of landscapes on two spatial scales: 4 federal states and 42 rural counties.|$|R

40|$|Where rapid {{urbanization}} is outpacing urban capacities {{to provide}} sound sanitation and wastewater treatment, most water sources in city vicinity are heavily polluted. This {{is of great}} concern {{as many of the}} leafy vegetables eaten raw in the cities are produced in these areas. Following the new WHO guidelines, different non-treatment options at farm, market, and kitchen level were field tested for health risk reduction with special consideration to efficiency and adoption potential. As most households are used to vegetable washing (although ineffectively), an important entry point for risk reduction is the increased emphasis of the new guidelines on food preparation measures. A combination of safer irrigation practices (water fetching, on-farm treatment, and application), the allocation of farmland with better water sources, and improved vegetable washing in kitchens appear to be able to reduce the potential risk of infections significantly, although it might not be possible to reach the ideal threshold without some kind of wastewater treatment.

Separation toilets for example separate urine {{that can be used}} in agriculture with some <b>crop</b> <b>restrictions</b> as a fertiliser after about 6 months of storage. The grey water has very low loads of nitrogen and can be treated in different combinations of biological and physical treatment and reused. Faecal matter with flush water from the separation toilet can be discharged into Rottebehaelter (an underground pre-composting tank) that retains solid material and drains liquid to a certain extent. Investigation of Rottebehaelter in the different sites and laboratory experiments showed that retained faecal material still contained a high percentage of water. However, odour was not noticed in those Rottebehaelters that have been examined. One of the major advantages of this system over other forms of pre-treatment as the septic tanks is that it does not deprive agriculture of the valuable nutrients and soil conditioner from human excreta. It has to be stated that maintenance is a crucial factor. As an intermediate result of the intensive research of Rottebehaelter it seems that these systems are rather a way of solids retaining, de-watering and long-term storage before the contents are further treated...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} the innovative methods used by urban farmers {{to reduce the}} health and environmental risks linked to wastewater-irrigated agriculture in Nairobi, Kenya. A study involving 317 urban and peri-urban farmers was conducted and innovative methods identified for risk-reduction in wastewater irrigation. According to the results, the farmers’ choice of adaptation measures in wastewater irrigation was: No intervention (49. 8 %), <b>crops</b> <b>restriction</b> (21. 1 %), protective clothing (12. 6 %), safer application (8. 8 %), and irrigation cessation (7. 6 %). The estimated model had a robust explanatory ability since the likelihood ratio statistics were statistically significant (2 c = 222. 13; p= 0. 000). The marginal analysis {{results show that the}} following factors significantly (p= 0. 005) influence the farmers’ choice of low-risk measures in wastewater irrigation: Household size, farming experience, membership to farmers group, access to credit, access to certified seed, access to media, crop income, awareness to World Health Organization irrigation guidelines, and awareness to wastewater hazards. Therefore, it was concluded that education support and creation of awareness about health risks in wastewater irrigation are important for enhanced adoption of risk-reduction technologies among the farmers. There is a need to design policies and programs that support farmers in safe wastewater irrigation, while raising their awareness on the health hazards attributed to untreated wastewater reuse.

Landholders, invited to suggest alternate conditions under which bunters could gain access to restricted land, pointed out that the single most important condition was for the hunter to request permission from the landholder to hunt. Approximately 88 percent of northern and 91 percent of southern landholders favored the concept of hunting.

40|$|Water {{suppliers}} {{in parts}} of Europe currently face occasional Drinking Water Directive compliance challenges {{for a number of}} pesticide active substances including metal- dehyde, clopyralid and propyzamide. Water Framework Directive (WFD) Article 7 promotes a prevention-led (catchment management) approach to such issues.

In this context, embedding agronomic drivers of pesticide use into catchment management and regulatory decision making processes can help to ensure that water quality problems are addressed at source without imposition of disproportionate cost on either agriculture or potable water suppliers. In this study agronomist knowledge, perception and expectations of current and possible future pesticide use was assessed and the significance of this knowledge to other stakeholders involved with pesticide catchment management was evaluated. This was then used to provide insight into the possible impacts of active substance restrictions and associated adaptation options.

These include the market prices variability of harvested products, the specific resource requests for each <b>crop,</b> the <b>restrictions</b> caused by limited machines availability, and the timing of operations required to complete each crop cultivation. We provide two different mathematical formulations for the analyzed problem. The first one represents a natural integer programming formulation looking for the crop-mix that maximizes the farmer's expected profit measured as the difference between revenues obtained by selling the harvested products and the production costs. Since the revenue of each crop depends on the price as quoted at the exchange market and the yield per hectare of harvested product, we define it as a random variable. Then, the second model uses the maximization of the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as objective function and looks for the crop-mix that allows to maximize the average expected profit under a predefined quantile of worst realizations. To test and compare the proposed models with the cultivation choice made by the farmer, we use Italian historical data represented by monthly returns of different crops over a time period of 16 years. Computational results emphasize the advantage of using the CVaR model for a risk-averse farmer and provide interesting insights for farmers involved in similar problems...|$|R

It constitutes further treatment which reduces the microbial contamination of water to a level where it can be used for the irrigation of all <b>crops,</b> without <b>restriction.</b> The storage of treated wastewater takes place during the winter, ensuring that such a resource is not lost and enabling a larger area to be irrigated during the dry season, thereby increasing agricultural production. Storage trials in reservoirs were conducted in north-eastern Tunisia. Their objective was to determine the length and conditions of secondary effluent decontamination as well as the impact of seasonal storage on water quality. The results indicate that the decontamination of effluents slows down with increased reservoir depth. For a depth of less than 150 cm, a reduction of fecal coliforms in the order of 3 log units is attained in 3 days when the average temperature of the water ranges from 22 to 25 degrees C; when this temperature is between 25. 5 and 28 degrees C, the same reduction takes 8 days. Below 20 degrees C, decontamination is considerably reduced: for a mean water temperature ranging from 12. 5 to 18 degrees C, the reduction of fecal coliforms reaches 3 log units only after a retention time of 17 days in the reservoir.

40|$|Oilseed rape (Brassica napus) is an {{important}} combinable break crop in the UK, which is largely protected from arthropod pests by insecticidal chemicals. Despite ongoing debate {{regarding the use of}} neonicotinoids, the dominant seed treatment ingredients used for this crop, there is little publicly available data comparing the efficacy of insecticides in controlling key arthropod pests or comparing the impacts on non-target species and the wider environment. To provide an insight into these matters, a UK-wide expert survey targeting agronomists and entomologists was conducted from March to June 2015. Based on the opinions of 90 respondents, an average of 20 % yield loss caused by the key arthropod pests was expected to have occurred in the absence of insecticide treatments. Relatively older chemical groups were perceived to have lower efficacy for target pests than newer ones, partly due to the development of insecticide resistance. Without neonicotinoid seed treatments, a lack of good control for cabbage stem flea beetle was perceived. Wide spectrum foliar insecticide sprays were perceived to have significantly greater negative impacts than seed treatments on users' health, natural enemies, pollinators, soil and water, and many foliar active ingredients have had potential risks for non-target arthropod species in UK oilseed rape fields for the past 25 years. Overall, 72 % of respondents opposed the neonicotinoid restriction, while 10 % supported it. Opposition and support of the restriction were largely based on concerns for pollinators and the wider environment, highlighting the uncertainty over the side effects of neonicotinoid use. More people from the government and research institutes leaned towards neutrality over the issue, compared to those directly involved in growing the <b>crop.</b> Neonicotinoid <b>restriction</b> was expected to result in greater effort and expenditure on pest control and lower production (0 - 1 t/ha less).

Our {{objective was to}} quantify the impact of two tillage practices and three levels of corn stover harvest on near-surface soil physical quality through the Least Limiting Water Range (LLWR). We evaluated no harvest, moderate and high stover harvest treatments within no-tillage and chisel plow plots following seven years of continuous corn production. Forty undisturbed soil samples {{were taken from the}} 0 – 7. 5 cm deep layer within each treatment and used to determine water retention curves, soil resistance to penetration and bulk density values (Bd). No-tillage plots had higher average soil bulk density and resistance to penetration values, and were more affected by stover harvest than chisel plow plots. The results confirmed that soil resistance to penetration determined the lower limit of the LLWR regardless of tillage or stover treatment, whereas soil aeration controlled the upper limit only at Bd 3 ̆e 1. 45 and Bd 3 ̆e 1. 55 Mg m- 3 for chisel plow and no-tillage, respectively. The LLWR was smallest for no-tillage with moderate or high corn stover harvest, indicating poor soil physical condition for plant growth, while the largest LLWR occurred with moderate stover harvest and chisel plowing. The introduction of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) into an extended rotation with no-tillage improved the LLWR by reducing the potential <b>crop</b> growth <b>restriction</b> due to resistance to penetration. Although bulk density values were only occasionally higher than the critical level (Bd = 1. 60 Mg m- 3 for chisel plow and Bd = 1. 64 Mg m- 3 for no-tillage), lower soil structure quality was evident with no-tillage under moderate or high stover harvest and with chisel plowing under high stover removal. The LLWR was more sensitive than available soil water content for detecting tillage and stover harvest effects on soil structural degradation...|$|R

In Czech Republic the farmers use for production planning mainly their expert knowledge and past experience. However, the mathematical programming approach enables find the true optimal solution of the problem, which especially in the problems with a great number of constraints is not easy to find intuitively. One of the possible barriers for using the general decision support systems (which are based on mathematical programming methods) for agriculture production planning in Czech Republic is its expensiveness. The small farmer can not afford to buy the expensive software or to employ a mathematical programming specialist. The aim of this paper is to present a user friendly linear programming model of the typical agricultural production planning problem in Czech Republic which can be solved via software tools commonly available in any farm (e. g. EXCEL). The linear programming model covering the restrictions on total costs, crop rotation, thresholds for the total area sowed by particular crops, total amount of manure and the need of feed crops is developed. The model is applied in real-world problem of Czech agriculture cooperative and the results of its solution are compared to the real decision made. The applicability of the model in every day agriculture managerial practice in Czech Republic is discussed and its possible enlargement is mentioned...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The aim was {{to analyze}} the {{establishment}} of young “Green Dwarf” coconut plants in soils affected by salts and under water stress, by evaluating leaf area, biomass production and allocation. In the experiment, conducted in protected environment in Fortaleza, CE, in statistical design of randomized blocks in a split plot arrangement, the effects of different water deficit levels (plots) were evaluated, by imposing different percentages of replacement of water losses by potential crop evapotranspiration - ETpc (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 %), associated with subplots consisting of increasing soil salinity levels (1. 72, 6. 25, 25. 80 and 40. 70 dS m- 1) provided by soil collected at {{different parts of the}} Morada Nova Irrigated Perimeter - PIMN. Leaf area and biomass production were sharply reduced by the conditions of water stress and high soil salinity, apparently being more critical to the <b>crop</b> under water <b>restriction</b> condition. The degree of water stress can increase the susceptibility to salinity and plants can be considered, in general terms, as moderately tolerant to the effects of salinity, when combined with water deficiency. Coconut seedlings show full capacity of establishment in PIMN saline soils, corresponding to the level of electrical conductivity of 6. 50 dS m- 1, but only when the water supply remains adequate. For higher salinity levels, plants survive, but their size is reduced by around 50 %, even when fully irrigated...|$|R
40|$|Biomass is broadly {{applicable}} in {{the energy}} sector for power, heat and transport, but it is strongly restricted by its availability. If biomass is supposed {{to contribute to a}} more sustainable energy system, its limited potential needs to be respected. Especially energy crops are in heavy competition with food and fi ber production, nature conservation and construction activity. This paper presents a model HEKTOR which helps to analyse the interdependencies between these various land uses. HEKTOR is a scenario tool that provides insight in the availability of agricultural land for the production of energy <b>crops</b> under sustainability <b>restrictions</b> on a national level. The model was applied to Poland and Germany. Two scenarios are presented: A ‘business-as-usual’ scenario is compared to a ‘sustainability’ scenario. On the one hand, the model quantifi es the confl ict of objectives between enhanced extensifi cation in agriculture and increased area for nature conservation. On the other hand, the synergies in restricting construction activity are assessed. Our results show that the sustainable energy potential from energy crops is strongly restricted for Germany compared to its energy demand whereas in Poland domestic agricultural biomass provides a much higher potential for energy supply, even if sustainability is comprehensively considered. Still, strong interdependencies with other land use are found. For energy crops to remain a sustainable option {{in the energy}} sector, its infl uence on the food markets must be considered more thoroughly and a comprehensive approach to sustainable development in land use is a prerequisite...|$|R
