5|$|North Korea {{has set up}} {{specific}} government {{objectives for}} tobacco control {{and there is a}} national agency to implement them, with eight full-time staff members. Although there is no free of charge smoking <b>cessation</b> quitline that callers could phone and discuss their problems, most health-care facilities offer support in <b>cessation,</b> including <b>cessation</b> programs and nicotine replacement therapy. Costs are covered for the patient partially or in full by the state. In addition to regular health-care clinics, there are 11 specialized anti-smoking centers in the country where consultation is free, but medicine is not. Of medicines, bupropion and varenicline are not legally available in North Korea, but herbal medicines are used as smoking <b>cessation</b> aids.|$|E
5|$|In Australia and the UK smoking <b>cessation</b> is {{the only}} {{licensed}} use of bupropion.|$|E
5|$|In a {{large-scale}} study of programs where bupropion {{was used for}} smoking <b>cessation</b> or treatment of depression, no withdrawal symptoms were observed. As of 2002 there were two case reports of people experiencing withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing buproprion taken to aid smoking cessation; the prescribing information states that dose tapering is not required when discontinuing treatment for smoking <b>cessation.</b>|$|E

40|$|Goldfish {{were trained}} to perform an operant {{response}} {{in order to obtain}} food, thereby allowing the food intake to be accurately determined. The normal daily food intake was established for each fish before it was given a sham operation or bilateral hypothalamic lesions. It was then observed over a period of up to 60 days. Lesions of the lateral areas of the hypothalamus were found to cause <b>cessations</b> of operant feeding of up to 60 days duration, and <b>cessations</b> of feeding on manually presented food of up to 35 days. Lesions of the anterior-medial areas were followed by <b>cessations</b> of operant feeding of up to 26 days. The post-lesioning food intake of fish lesioned in the posterior-medial area was {{similar to that of the}} control fish. No increases in operant feeding were observed after lesioning. The results are considered to be consistent with a genuine aphagia induced by lesions of the lateral hypothalamus...|$|R

5|$|The {{next most}} common use is {{as an aid}} for smoking <b>cessation.</b> Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} of nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion is helpful for smoking <b>cessation</b> in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the effectiveness of bupropion is not due to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. The effectiveness of bupropion is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|E
5|$|Cigarette {{smoking is}} the best-established avoidable {{risk factor for}} {{pancreatic}} cancer, approximately doubling risk among long-term smokers, the risk increasing {{with the number of}} cigarettes smoked and the years of smoking. The risk declines slowly after smoking <b>cessation,</b> taking some 20 years to return to almost that of non-smokers.|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} the {{large-scale}} circulation (LSC) dynamics of turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection is presented. It consists of two stochastic ordinary differential equations motivated by the Navier-Stokes equation, one each for the strength and the azimuthal orientation of the LSC. Stochastic forces represent phenomenologically {{the action of the}} turbulent fluctuations on the LSC. Without adjustable parameters, the model yields a meandering LSC with occasional rotations, and with more rare <b>cessations</b> that occur a few times per day [...] differing only by about a factor of two from experiment. Also as in experiments, the distribution of LSC orientation-change is uniform for <b>cessations</b> and a power law for rotations.

50|$|In 1829, Leopardi wrote La quiete dopo la tempesta ("The Calm After the Storm"), {{in which}} the light and reassuring verses at the {{beginning}} evolve into the dark desperation of the concluding strophe, where pleasure and joy are conceived of as only momentary <b>cessations</b> of suffering and the highest pleasure is provided only by death.|$|R
50|$|The last non-military {{execution}} in Mexico was in 1937, {{and the last}} military execution (of a soldier charged with insubordination and murder) was in 1961, so the official abolition of the military death penalty in 2005 and of the civil death penalty in 1976 lagged the de facto <b>cessations</b> by 68 and 15 years, respectively.|$|R

5|$|Roughly 100,000 British and German {{troops were}} {{involved}} in the unofficial <b>cessations</b> of hostility along the Western Front.

Bruce Bairnsfather described the truce.|$|R
30|$|However, and {{contrary}} to C. thermocellum (Weimer and Zeikus 1977), cultures grown on glucose/cellobiose mixtures demonstrated that C. acetobutylicum was unable to co-utilize both substrates {{at the same time}} and glucose was consistently the preferred carbon source. In the present work, growth <b>cessations</b> were always observed after glucose exhaustion and before cellobiose utilization, resulting in a second growth phase.|$|R
50|$|The Christmas truce, was {{a series}} of brief {{unofficial}} <b>cessations</b> of hostilities occurring on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day of 1914 between German and British or French troops in World War I, particularly that between British and German troops stationed along the Western Front. During the truce, a game of football was played between the British and German soldiers.|$|R

5|$|Suicidal {{behavior}} {{is less of}} a concern when bupropion is prescribed for smoking <b>cessation.</b> According to a 2014 Cochrane review, while there is an association with suicide it is unclear if bupropion was the cause.

5|$|Adjacent and {{now serving}} as an annex to the Palazzo dei Conservatori is Palazzo Caffarelli Clementino; here, {{short-term}} exhibitions are held.
