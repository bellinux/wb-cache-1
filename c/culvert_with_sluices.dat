40|$|I studied {{environmental}} conditions, fish assemblages, and culvert {{features in}} 11 headwater streams (Tennessee and Conasauga river drainages) in Cherokee National Forest (Blue Ridge ecoregion), Tennessee, May-August 2008. Culvert-related effects on instream habitat and fish assemblages were measured at 10 stream sites: five sites contained <b>culverts</b> <b>with</b> artificial bottom substrates and five sites contained <b>culverts</b> <b>with</b> natural bottom substrates. On each stream, paired sampling reaches (reach length 35 times mean reach width, drainage area 3 ̆c 11 km 2) were established 50 m upstream and 50 m downstream of the culvert. Reaches downstream of <b>culverts</b> <b>with</b> artificial substrates (compared to upstream reaches; related-samples t test) exhibited greater water depths, lower gravel/sediment depths, and higher percentages of bedrock and boulder substrates (P 3 ̆c 0. 10). Reaches downstream of natural substrate culverts (compared to upstream reaches) exhibited faster current velocities (P 3 ̆c 0. 10). Fish abundance (predominantly western blacknose dace Rhinichthys obtusus) was consistently higher downstream than upstream (P 3 ̆c 0. 10), {{regardless of the}} culvert type. In addition, reaches downstream of artificial substrate culverts exhibited reduced species evenness compared to upstream reaches. Mark-recapture experiments on two streams documented fish movements through a natural substrate culvert (similar to those in reference areas); however, movements through a perched pipe culvert were not detected. Data collected i n the present study suggest that culverts had localized effects on instream habitat and fish assemblages, and that certain types of culverts may impede fish dispersal...|$|R

40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} and nonindigenous species are 2 {{of the leading}} causes of species loss globally. Thus, scientific information is needed to assess their interactive effects on the biota of lotic ecosystems. We tested the hypothesis that culverts (i. e., pipes) at road–stream intersections elevate flow velocities and differentially slow upstream locomotion of native relative to nonindigenous crayfishes. We: 1) mapped culvert locations and measured their flow; 2) quantified movement of Orconectes propinquus (native) in <b>culverts</b> <b>with</b> velocities of 2, 31, and 42 cm/s; 3) compared the movement of Orconectes rusticus (nonindigenous), O. propinquus, and Orconectes virilis (native) in a <b>culvert</b> <b>with</b> velocity of 30 cm/s; and 4) used a recirculating flume to determine the water velocity that impeded upstream movement (impedance velocity) of each species. Culverts had higher velocities than upstream riffles during baseflow conditions. Orconectes propinquus moved upstream in <b>culverts</b> <b>with</b> flows. 30 cm/s, but individuals slipped more frequently and traveled slower than those tested at 2 cm/s. Orconectes rusticus moved upstream faster in culverts and had an impedance velocity, 6 cm/s faster than O. propinquus (34. 0 6 1. 2 cm/s, mean 6 1 SE) and, 8 cm/s faster than O. virilis (32. 0 6 1. 1 cm/s). Culverts impeded crayfish upstream movement differently among species. Nonindigenous species tolerated higher flows, so culverts may create a filter that favors the spread of invasive species. Culverts should be designed to keep water velocity, 30 cm/s to mitigate flow effects on crayfish passage, thereby minimizing the possible combined effects of {{fragmentation and}} nonindigenous species introductions...|$|R

These parameters include the channel bottom slope, the initial Froude number and the ratio of the initial depth to culvert height. To study the turbulence characteristics, precise and accurate measurements of the mean fluctuating flow quantities such as streamwise and vertical mean velocity components, and streamwise and vertical turbulence intensity components and turbulence shear stress were carried out. Also, this paper presents the results of a Laser Doppler Velocimetry study of hydraulic jumps in a <b>culvert</b> <b>with</b> different relative tailwater depths and different initial Froude numbers. The characteristics of hydraulic jumps were discussed and analyzed. Non– dimensional design curves were provided to relate the jump characteristics. The maximum vertical velocity in the recirculating zone for all jumps is about 6 % of the initial velocity. The results show that the maximum streamwise velocity near the center plane was smaller than that near the side wall. The turbulence shear stress near the center was about (35 - 45) % higher than that near the side wall. After the jump, the flow will recover into a two-dimensional flow...|$|R
