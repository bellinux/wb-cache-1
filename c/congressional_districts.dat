She was in charge of coordinating the women's congress, held at the Panama Pacific Exposition in 1915. When the CUWS became the National Woman's Party (NWP) in 1916, Stevens organized party delegates for each of the 435 <b>Congressional</b> <b>Districts</b> in an effort to attain national women's enfranchisement and defeat candidates who were opposed to women's rights.
