50|$|ATC Zero (Air Traffic Control Zero) is an {{official}} term {{used by the}} U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that means the FAA is unable to safely provide the published ATC (air traffic control) services within the airspace managed by a specific facility. The term is always {{used in conjunction with}} a facility reference. FAA ATC facilities include Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC); Terminal Radar Control facility (TRACON), Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT), Flight Service Stations (FSS), or the Air Traffic Control System Command Center(ATCSCC). The term is defined in FAA Order JO 1900.47, Air Traffic Control <b>Operational</b> <b>Contingency</b> <b>Plans.</b> It is one of three designations used by the FAA (ATC Alert, ATC Limited, and ATC Zero) to describe degraded operations and invoke <b>operational</b> <b>contingency</b> <b>plans.</b>|$|R
40|$|In 1998 Norske Skog, {{then known}} as Australian Newsprint Mills, started an {{extensive}} program to reduce odour that was being generated from its effluent treatment plant. Section 4 (iii) of the Pollution reduction Program issued to (then) Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd on June 15 th 1998 required the company to: “Prepare and submit {{a report to the}} EPA on preferred options for introduction of in-line continuous monitoring that identify the onset of conditions for anaerobic decay within individual plant units. The report must identify <b>operational</b> <b>contingency</b> <b>plans</b> when the onset of conditions for anaerobic decay are detected by the monitors. ” The purpose of this report is to summarise the work done to fulfil the EPA requirement. At the AWWOA conference in 1998, the first findings were reported on the odour reduction program about to undertaken. This paper highlights the success we achieved in implementing this program as well as further steps that were taken to identify odour potential...|$|R
40|$|Abstract] “The Secretary of the Defense Office of Force Transformation (OFT) is {{currently}} undertaking an initiative, {{which seeks to}} provide operationally responsive access to, and near term tactical exploitation of space. TacSat- 1 is the first adaptive experiment in this initiative, which seeks to exploit access to space within the <b>operational</b> <b>contingency</b> <b>planning</b> cycle. ” 5 As this effort becomes successful and scales up to many satellites and other assets, the ground segment quickly becomes the weakest link in that chain as we can foresee thousands of web-enabled space/ground/sea nodes interconnected to provide for a better tactical awareness and more responsive operations. Operational users need to rapidly access the data products they need. If the products do not exist, the ground system needs to quickly discover how to generate them and what sensors to task. Tactical users will not task satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV’s) directly as those assets will become part of an invisible infrastructure available on-demand 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The Open GeoSpatial Consortium (OGC) is actively working on many specifications tha...|$|R
40|$|An {{effective}} strategy of disaster mitigation policy must be formulated immediately. Act 24 of 2007 about Disaster Mitigation (UUPB) {{has provided a}} more certain policy framework for disaster mitigation policy {{but it is still}} subjected to weaknesses. These weaknesses are so obvious in the implementation of disaster mitigation policy at local level. Research is conducted at Malang District, East Java, Indonesia. Method of research is descriptive. Type of data is qualitative which is understood by Van Metter and Van Horn’s theory of policy implementation. Field findings have indicated that at pre-disaster, the following actions are not yet taken such as integrating the implementation of disaster mitigation into a local planning document, reducing the disaster risk, preventing the disaster, formulating the Disaster Risk Analysis, enforcing the space order plan, carrying out the disaster education and training, and formulating technical standard document of disaster mitigation. During the disaster, some important immediate matters are not well managed such as preparedness, early warning and mitigation. A number of urgent documents such as <b>contingency</b> <b>plan</b> and <b>operational</b> <b>plan</b> are not formulated. Risk assessment is inappropriately executed. At post-disaster condition, rehabilitative and reconstruction plans are not maximum. Indeed, an appropriate strategy of disaster mitigation policy needs to be formulated based on the local condition. Within this review, a number of policy strategies that must be considered by the loca...|$|R
40|$|Railway {{infrastructure}} {{already has}} some ‘smart’ characteristics, {{in that it}} ‘knows’ where trains are located and can sometimes detect track and other equipment faults. There is considerable scope to increase these capabilities. There is also a significant and urgent need for such improvements: railways have limited operational flexibility and face increasing passenger and freight traffic demand on existing infrastructure. The reliable provision of additional capacity requires improved system ‘self-knowledge’ for traffic control and management purposes, {{as well as for}} system reliability and safety. The use of smart infrastructure for fault prediction and the guidance of preventive maintenance helps to maintain operational capacity. This approach also helps to reduce track access requirements for traditional maintenance and renewals activities, thus increasing network availability and total capacity. Climate change presents the railway industry with significant challenges, notably in terms of flooding and earthworks failures resulting from increased rainfall intensity. Smart infrastructure includes the prediction and monitoring of such events to maintain safety and enable the timely implementation of <b>operational</b> <b>contingency</b> <b>plans.</b> This paper draws upon a range of sources to identify the needs for and potential benefits of increased deployment of smart infrastructure and other assets on railways in Britain and elsewhere. <br/...|$|R
