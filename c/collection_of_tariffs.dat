Responding to an urgent need for revenue following the American Revolutionary War, after the U.S. Constitution was ratified by the ninth state in 1788 the newly elected First United States Congress passed, and President George Washington, signed the <b>Tariff</b> Act <b>of</b> July 4, 1789, which authorized the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> duties (customs) on imported goods. Tariffs and excise taxes were authorized by the United States Constitution and recommended by the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, in 1789, to tax foreign imports. Hamilton {{thought it was important}} to start the U.S. federal government out on a sound financial basis with good credit and a regular, easily collected source of income. Customs duties (tariffs) on imported goods, as set by tariff rates, were the source of about 80-95% of all federal revenue up to 1860. Having just fought a war over taxation (among other things) the U.S. Congress wanted a reliable source of income that was relatively unobtrusive, brought in enough money to pay off the debt and pay for the relatively low cost federal government (then) and be relatively easy to collect. Tariffs met all these criteria.|$|R

It also provided a degree of protection. [...] "The protective acts of the states furnished the experience on which the national legislators based their proceedings." [...] The general range of duties {{was by no means}} such as would have been thought protective in later days; but the intention to protect was there. The debates over the purpose <b>of</b> the <b>tariff</b> exposed the sectional interests at stake: Northern manufacturers favored high duties to protect industry; Southern planters desired a low tariff that would foster cheap consumer imports. The final bill extracted concessions from both interests, but delivered a distinct advantage to maritime and manufacturing regions of the country. Representative James Madison of Virginia navigated to passage, but was unable to insert provisions that would have discriminated against British imports and shift the carrying trade to French and American vessels. The Tariff Bill was passed in the House by a vote of 31-19 on July 1, 1789; the resultant enrolled Bill was signed by the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate on July 2, 1789; and President Washington signed the Act in law on July 4, 1789.|$|R

With a computable general equilibrium model we analyze the four most prominent trade disputes between the EU and the USA, which we call "mini trade wars": the Hormones, the Bananas, the Foreign Sales Corporations and the Steel cases. The economic analysis revealed several flaws and peculiarities: As a rule, retaliatory tariffs are detrimental to welfare of the retaliating country and amount to "shooting oneself in the foot". Trade wars can only be won by large countries. The WTO arbitrator's estimation of the trade loss in case of non-compliance never translates into equivalent damage to economic welfare. A mechanism to control the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> retaliatory <b>tariff</b> revenues is missing as is a system to compensate the firms suffering the damage.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the SAP on the {{agricultural}} sector {{were found to be}} generally positive, especially the incentives to export agriculture, which benefited directly from the exchange rate devaluation. For some of the food crops the price effects were moderated by lack of infrastructure necessary to expand production. Trade policies resulted in relative isolation of foodcrops from the world markets and, while protecting them from external competition, prevented the beneficial devaluation effects to be passed on to these crops. Despite the fact that several methodological approaches were used in the evaluation, the results can only be considered as indicative due to the dearth of "post-SAP" data. It is difficult, for instance, to give a definitive answer as to the policy response of tree crops and livestock to the programme, given the short time period between the programme's implementation and its evaluation, and the long time it takes for such sectors to fully adjust. Appropriate surveys did not exist in the rural areas, and conducting such surveys was beyond the scope of the project. The extraction of definite conclusions regarding the social dimensions of the policy reforms was, therefore, inhibited. Thus, our conclusions on the social {{effects of the}} programme is based on either aggregated data or data covering only very small areas in the country. The decline of the agricultural sector was, to a certain extent, "natural", i. e. it would have happened even in the presence of "proper policies" {{in the presence of a}} booming oil sector. The study used a number of relatively simple empirical procedures to disentangle policy from non-policy effects. It is important that such methodological devices be transmitted to the staff of the Ministry of Agriculture through training so constant programme monitoring and evaluation can be carried out. Serious problems were faced in evaluating the programme due to the highly divergent sources of data. The establishment of a system for consolidation and computerization of agricultural data is long overdue. Although successful results in the agricultural sector are largely determined by macroeconomic policies, there is room for agricultural policy to improve agricultural performance and well-being in rural areas. Fertilizer subsidies remain an important (and thorny) issue. Despite the Government's own declarations about the (non) functionality of the present system, not much has been done to drastically change it. Implementing a plan to enhance the participation of the private sector in the fertilizer distribution system and reducing the level of the subsidy will be a daunting but worthwhile challenge. The importance of rehabilitation of the feeder road network cannot be overemphasized. Deteriorating rural feeder roads constitute a major impediment to market integration and extenuate interregional price variability. The system of bans on food imports was found to be defective, to expose producers to high price variability and to prevent imports and exports even when domestic prices are very high (low). A move to a system <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> will potentially have many advantages, including <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariff</b> revenues...|$|R
40|$|The {{organized}} and controlled form of collecting consumption taxes and toll from the import and export trade {{goes back to}} the 17 th century in Sweden. The customs administration and procedure were regulated by royal announcements, and the majority of the documents found in the customs archives represent thus records stipulated by such notifications. The customs archives can be used for research on several levels; the announcements reflect currents within both the domestic and foreign politics, while the account lists for financial statistics portray the extent of the trade. The various lists of compilation can be further used to follow for instance the development of different units of measurement, the expansion of tax rates, the value of trade goods or the changes in monetary units or systems. The diaries, architectural plans of the customs offices and maps of the toll areas place the customs officials and their work within the local scenery.

This was done {{after four years of}} preparation that required passing a new law (Law 401) to allow public-private partnerships in water supply. The contract was awarded to the French company Ondéo‐Liban, a subsidiary of Suez Environnement, after a competitive bidding process. The cost of 20 million Euro was financed by the French Development Agency. The contract included the operation, maintenance, and installation of equipment, the organization of the billing system and <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> water <b>tariffs,</b> the management <b>of</b> human and financial resources, and the supervision of the construction of a tertiary water supply network and the expansion of a water treatment plant. The private company increased the billing efficiency from 30% to 60%, reduced water rationing, mapped the network, updated the customer inventory, computerized the accounting system and trained staff. Non-revenue water was reduced from 65% to 45% and the 10-year-long water rationing in the areas of Qalamoun, Qobbe and Abi Samra was eliminated, making Tripoli the only city in Lebanon that receives water 24 hours per day. Water quality and the customer service were also improved. However, cost recovery was not achieved despite an increase in tariffs because bill collection efficiency remained low. The company was unable to introduce metering, although 40,000 meters were acquired. The contract faced a number of challenges: According {{to a study by the}} French Institute for Public-Private Partnerships, the supervisory committee was composed of former employees of the public water company who were not convinced of the usefulness of private sector participation. Despite its achievements, the management contract ended in 2007 without being extended.|$|R
