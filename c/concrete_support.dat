5|$|The {{gymnasium}} has {{a capacity}} of approximately 16,000 and the smaller building can accommodate up 5,300 depending on the events that are taking place. At {{the time it was}} built, the gymnasium had the world's largest suspended roof span. Two reinforced concrete pillars support a pre-stressed steel net onto which steel plates are attached. The bottom anchoring of this steel net is a heavy <b>concrete</b> <b>support</b> system which forms a distinct curve on the interior and exterior of the building. In the interior, this structural anchor is used to support the grandstand seats. The overall curvature of the roof helps protect the building from the damaging effects of strong winds.|$|E
5|$|CT {{scanning}} of {{the known}} specimens of Euchambersia by Benoit and colleagues was subsequently used to provide more <b>concrete</b> <b>support</b> in favour of the venom hypothesis. The canals leading into and from the maxillary fossae, as revealed by the scans, would primarily have supported the trigeminal nerve as well as blood vessels. However, {{the fact that the}} canals also directly lead to the root of the canines would suggest that they had a secondary role in venom delivery. In all, Euchambersia seems to have had a venom gland (housed in the maxillary fossae), a delivery mechanism of the venom (the maxillary canals), and an instrument by which a wound for venom delivery can be inflicted (the ridged canines), which satisfy the criteria of a venomous animal as defined by Wolfgang Bücherl. Benoit et al. noted that this does not conclusively demonstrate that Euchambersia was actually venomous, especially given the previously stated objections. Additionally, there are no living animals with a delivery system analogous to the proposed system for Euchambersia (most deliver venom through the lower jaw, while snakes have specialized ducts.|$|E

25|$|Ahead of the 1997 {{parliamentary}} election, Jagland {{announced the}} cabinet would resign if the Labour Party received less than 36.9% {{of the popular}} vote. This was {{the percentage of the}} vote that the party had received in the 1993 election while Brundtland was still leading, which had provided them with an unclear mandate to govern. The Constitution of Norway does not require a cabinet to be formally approved by Parliament in order to serve, and a minority government that lacks <b>concrete</b> <b>support</b> from its inception may serve {{as long as it does}} not receive a vote of no confidence.|$|E
25|$|Situated on {{the high}} ridge above the gun emplacements, the battery {{observation}} post is a two-level structure built of off-form concrete, to house the range finder and the command post. External timber stairs survive, and rooftop fittings that formerly carried a camouflage netted structure. The upper level contains original timber joinery to observation slit and doorway and four intact concrete mounting blocks, possibly for a vertical rangefinder. The lower level comprises one large room with steel-reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>support</b> beam and pillar beneath the mounting blocks in the upper level. Both levels contain evidence of a later interior fitout as residential accommodation.|$|E
25|$|Damage {{intensity}} {{varied from}} EF1 to EF2 in intensity as the tornado entered Wilcox County and passed {{near the town}} of Rochelle. Off Double Run Road and CR 41, a small farm building was completely destroyed. Two residences had their windows broken, and a metal building structure was severely damaged, with several anchored metal trusses ripped from the concrete foundation; this resulted in total collapse of the building. Additional metal barns and outbuildings nearby were severely damaged. Along Crawford Dairy Road, several large wooden electrical transmission towers were snapped. Farther northeast, a semi-truck trailer was flipped, flattened, and pushed across the road. Another metal building structure had its southeast corner completely destroyed, and it had a few 2ft (0.61m) deep <b>concrete</b> <b>support</b> beams ripped out of the ground. A small home sustained minor roof and siding damage, and several single to double-wide mobile homes were completely destroyed, with debris thrown up to 100yd (91m) downstream. Damage to some of the manufactured homes was consistent with a high-end EF2 tornado. The storm crossed Highway 280, destroying several small wooden sheds and fences, and downing numerous trees before finally lifting along Kingfisher Road west of Abbeville at 4:27p.m. EST (21:27UTC).|$|E

25|$|Natural {{selection}} {{in an environment}} produces reproductive success, which benefits the species. Speciation {{is a process of}} evolution through which new biological species are formed. Dobzhansky studied the specifics of sexual, physiological, and behavioral isolating mechanisms in Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila paulistrorum. Like many of his other studies, Dobzhansky's work on reproductive isolation was aimed at studying the process of evolution in action. Bringing samples from each population back into the laboratory, Dobzhansky showed that he could vary environmental conditions so as to produce the same changes in frequency of inversion patterns that were observed with changing seasons in the field. Dobzhansky concluded that such seasonal fluctuations were the result of natural selection at work, with temperature acting as the selecting agent. These masterful studies provided <b>concrete</b> <b>support</b> for the theory of natural selection, at the same time illustrating the fruitfulness of combining field and laboratory work in the study of evolution. Adaptive evolution occurs through the dominance and survival of competing genes within a species. This is caused by increasing the frequency of those alleles whose phenotypic effects selfishly promote their own reproduction. He also believed new species could not arise from single mutations and must be isolated from others of its species by time, geography, habitat, or breeding season.|$|E

500|$|The Tompkins Hill Road {{overpass}} {{is situated}} {{just south of}} Fields Landing and {{was built in the}} late 1960s. It suffered slight damage during the 1975 earthquake and was due for a retrofit in 1981. The overpass was constructed with cement abutments on earthen ramps on either end and a series of <b>concrete</b> <b>support</b> columns in the middle. Eight [...] reinforced concrete spans accommodated northbound and southbound lanes of traffic, with no anchors connecting the spans with each other or to the abutments. At the time of the shock, two of the southbound spans came off their support (a [...] ledge) and six people were injured when a Volkswagen Beetle and a small pickup truck plummeted off the bridge.|$|E

2500|$|After 2008 global {{financial}} crisis {{which led to}} the steep rise in unemployment especially among the banking and finance industries, Tsang announced on 8 December 2008 to create 60,000 jobs in 2009 by speeding up infrastructure projects and a ten-fold increase in its loan guarantee scheme for small and medium sized enterprises. The Tsang government also quickly formed a Task Force on Economic Challenges to deal with the crisis. Tsang came up with six economic sectors to explore with the recommendations of the Task Force in his 2009–10 policy address: (1) testing and certification, (2) medical services, (3) innovation and technology, (4) cultural and creative industries, (5) environmental industry, and (6) educational services. The government pledged to provide more <b>concrete</b> <b>support</b> in those sectors and called them as the [...] "new economic pillars". After a year of negative record of GDP growth rate, the Hong Kong economy recovered quickly from 2010, despite the poverty population keep growing under Tsang tenure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{supporting}} piles of deep foundation pits are usually made in reinforced concrete materials and rarely in prestressed concrete materials. But prestressed concrete materials have higher stiffness and less deformation and {{are suitable for}} controlling displacements or settlements. So, in this paper a practical engineering project as an example, the prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>supporting</b> piles of the deep foundation pit are calculated and designed. Then, the settlement and inclination of the building adjacent the foundation pit with the prestressed concrete piles are calculated in the numerical software, FLAC. The results calculated in FLAC are compared with the actual settlement and inclination of the adjacent building during the foundation pit is excavated. The comparison confirms the feasibility of the supporting structure. This is a useful trial {{on the design of}} the prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>supporting</b> piles...|$|R
50|$|Cliff {{stabilization}} is {{a coastal}} management erosion control technique. This is {{most suitable for}} softer or less stable cliffs. Generally speaking, the cliffs are stabilised through dewatering (drainage of excess rainwater to reduce water-logging) or anchoring (the use of terracing, planting, wiring or <b>concrete</b> <b>supports</b> to hold cliffs in place).|$|R
