50|$|An {{alternative}} <b>chemical</b> <b>toughening</b> process involves {{forcing a}} surface layer of glass at least 0.1 mm thick into compression by ion exchange of the sodium ions {{in the glass}} surface with potassium ions (which are 30% larger), by immersion of the glass into a bath of molten potassium nitrate. <b>Chemical</b> <b>toughening</b> results in increased toughness compared with thermal toughening and {{can be applied to}} glass objects of complex shapes.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a {{microstructure}} and hardness investigations of the hypoeutectoid steels Mn-Cr-Ni, imitating by its <b>chemical</b> composition <b>toughening</b> steels, are presented in the paper. The analysis of the kinetics of phase transformations of undercooled austenite of steels containing different amounts of alloying elements in their chemical composition, constitutes the aim of investigations...|$|R
