5000|$|Tversky and Kahneman defined {{representativeness}} as [...] "the {{degree to}} which event (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population, and (ii) reflects the salient features of {{the process by which}} it is generated". When people rely on representativeness to make judgments, they are likely to judge wrongly because the fact that something is more representative does not actually make it more likely. The representativeness heuristic is simply described as assessing similarity of objects and organizing them based around the <b>category</b> <b>prototype</b> (e.g., like goes with like, and causes and effects should resemble each other).This heuristic is used because it is an easy computation. The problem is that people overestimate its ability to accurately predict the likelihood of an event. Thus, it can result in neglect of relevant base rates and other cognitive biases.|$|E
50|$|In social {{psychology}} a <b>category</b> <b>prototype</b> may {{be thought of}} as a “representative exemplar” of a category. Self-categorization theory predicts that what is prototypical of a category is contingent on the context in which the category is encountered. More specifically, when the comparative context changes (i.e., the psychologically available stimuli change) this has implications for how the self category is perceived and the nature of subsequent depersonalization. To continue with a prior example, when physicists are a psychologically available comparison group to psychologists, those psychologists are more likely to adopt behaviours that reflect a perception that the ingroup is comparably unscientific. However, when artists are the psychologically available comparison group, those same psychologists are more likely to behave in a manner that highlights the scientific aspects of the category. To rephrase the above process in the language of the theory, self-categorization theory predicts that individuals adopt the features of a salient self category (self-stereotyping), and the content of the category they adopt depends on the present comparative context.|$|E
40|$|Are there {{consequences}} of calling objects by their names? Lupyan (2008) suggested that overtly labeling objects impairs subsequent recognition memory because labeling shifts stored memory representations of objects toward the <b>category</b> <b>prototype</b> (representational shift hypothesis). In Experiment 1, {{we show that}} processing objects at the basic category level versus exemplar level {{in the absence of}} any overt labeling produces the same qualitative pattern of results. Experiment 2 demonstrates that labeling does not always disrupt memory as predicted by the representational shift hypothesis: Differences in memory following labeling versus preference are more likely an effect of judging preference, not an effect of overt labeling. Labeling does not influence memory by shifting memory representations toward the <b>category</b> <b>prototype.</b> Rather, labeling objects at the basic level produces memory representations that are simply less robust than those produced by other kinds of study tasks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract What effect does {{labeling}} {{an object}} {{as a member}} of a familiar category have on memory for that object? Recent studies suggest that recognition memory can be negatively impacted by categorizing objects during encoding. This paper examines the ‘‘representational shift hypothesis’ ’ which argues that categorizing an object impairs recognition memory by altering the trace of the encoded memory to be more similar to the <b>category</b> <b>prototype.</b> Previous evidence for this idea comes from experiments in which a basic-level category labeling task was compared to a non-category labeling incidental encoding task, usually a preference judgment (e. g., ‘‘Do you like this item?’’). In two experiments, we examine alternative tasks that attempt to control for processing demands and the degree to which category information is explicitly recruited at the time of study. Contrary to the predictions of the representational shift hypothesis, we find no evidence that memory is selectively impaired by category labeling. Overall, the pattern of results across both studies appears consistent with well-established variables known to influence memory such as encoding specificity and distinctiveness effects...|$|E

While <b>category</b> <b>prototype</b> structure forms a strong motivating and constraining factor for hyperonym/hyponym contrast (e. g. Lehrer 1990), what is lacking in previous work is a systematic consideration of the phenomenon in real language use. To that end, data from the GloWbE corpus (Davies 2013) was used to investigate which terms for items of clothing (e. g. coat, bra, jeans) can be contrasted with their hyperonym (either clothes or clothing). While marginal members of the ITEM OF CLOTHING category (e. g. belt, hat) have a stronger potential for contrasting with the hyperonym, even prototypical hyponyms (e. g. shirt, jeans) contrasted with clothes/clothing {{in at least some}} contexts. Language users can therefore manipulate category boundaries to meet their discourse needs, exploiting a range of dimensions of difference to create contrast. Many clothing terms were also found to contrast more readily with clothes than with clothing, suggesting that the meaning of clothes is generally narrower than that of its near-synonym clothing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Scene {{recognition}} systems which {{attempt to}} deal with a large number of scene categories currently lack proper knowledge about the perceptual ontology of scene categories and would enjoy significant ad-vantage from a perceptually meaningful scene representation. In this work we perform a large-scale human study to create “SceneNet”, an online ontology database for scene understanding that organizes scene categories according to their perceptual relationships. This perceptual ontology suggests that perceptual relationships do not always conform the semantic structure between categories, and it entails a lower dimen-sional perceptual space with “perceptually meaningful ” Euclidean dis-tance, where each embedded category is represented by a single proto-type. Using the SceneNet ontology and database we derive a compu-tational scheme for learning non-linear mapping of scene images into the perceptual space, where each scene image is closest to its <b>category</b> <b>prototype</b> than to any other prototype by a large margin. Then, we demonstrate how this approach facilitates improvements in large-scale scene categorization over state-of-the-art methods and existing seman-tic ontologies, and how it reveals novel perceptual findings about the discriminative power of visual attributes and the typicality of scenes...|$|E

ARTEX specializes the FACADE model {{of how the}} visual cortex sees, and the ART model of how temporal and prefrontal cortices interact with the hippocampal system to learn visual recognition categories and their names.

40|$|The authors {{contrast}} exemplar-based and prototype-based {{processes in}} dot-pattern categorization. In Experiments 1 A and 1 B, participants provided similarity ratings of dot-distortion pairs that were distortions {{of the same}} originating prototype. The results show that comparisons to training exemplars surrounding the prototype create flat typicality gradients within a category and small prototypeenhancement effects, whereas comparisons to a prototype center create steep typicality gradients within a category and large prototype-enhancement effects. Thus, prototype and exemplar theories make different predictions regarding common versions of the dot-distortion task. Experiment 2 tested these different predictions by having participants learn dot-pattern categories. The steep typicality gradients, the large prototype effects, and the superior fit of prototype models suggest that participants refer to-be-categorized items to a representation near the category’s center (the prototype), {{and not to the}} training exemplars that surround the prototype. Some descriptions of categorization suggest that humans average their exemplar experiences to form a <b>category</b> <b>prototype,</b> compare new items to it, and accept the items as category members if they are similar enough to the prototype. Other descriptions of categorization suggest that humans store the exemplars they experience as whole, independent memory traces, compare new items to these, and accept the items as category members if they are similar enough to the exemplars. This theoretical issue remains unresolved because both prototype and exemplar theories (and models) are powerful enough to explain many phenomena.

Although brand extensions have become a standard strategy for new product introductions in today 2 ̆ 7 s fiercely competitive marketplace, the extant literature has examined brand extensions as if they occur in a competitive vacuum. This study attempts to fill this void by examining brand extensions in a competitive context. Specifically, brand-extension strategy in a competitive context includes two key decisions: (1) whether the brand should be compared against the prototypical brand of the extension category, against a nonprototypical brand, or whether a comparison should be avoided; and (2) whether typical attributes of the extension category or atypical ones should be highlighted. In two experiments, we use comparative and noncomparative ads as vehicles in exploring the two key decisions of brand extension strategy in a competitive context. Our findings suggest that, if there is a high fit between the established image of a brand and the extension category, a brand extension with attributes that are perceived to be typical in the extension category is judged to be of higher quality when consumers evaluate the brand extension on its own grounds rather than in comparison with brands in the extension category. In contrast, when the brand does not fit easily with the extension category, the brand with typical attributes is judged to be of higher quality if the brand is positioned explicitly against the prototypical brand of the extension category. Finally, in cases in which the brand 2 ̆ 7 s attributes in the extension category are atypical (i. e., the brand possesses attributes that differentiate it from other brands in the extension category), positioning the brand against the <b>category</b> <b>prototype</b> is generally preferable to the noncomparative format.
