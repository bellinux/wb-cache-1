First it notes two previous declarations of the Supreme Soviet — [...] "On sovereignty of state of Latvia" [...] of 28 July 1989, which declared that the Latvian SSR will act as a sovereign state and that laws adopted by the Soviet Union will <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>force</b> in the territory of Latvian SSR only if the Supreme Soviet has ratified them and [...] "In question of independence of Latvia" [...] of 15 February 1990, in which the Supreme Soviet condemns declaration [...] "On accession of Latvia to Soviet Union" [...] of 21 July 1940, however none of these explicitly called for secession from the Soviet Union. Secondly it notes Appeal of All-Latvian congress of people deputies of 21 April 1990, which called for restoration of independence. Then it is stated that the Supreme Soviet is acting in accordance with the will of inhabitants of Latvia, which had been clearly expressed by electing as a majority those deputies, who had stated that they will restore independence of the Republic of Latvia in their reelection programme.|$|E

They feared this apparition fully {{as much as}} they did Numa, yet they would gladly have slain the thing could they quickly enough have gathered together their wits; but fear and superstition and a natural mental density held them paralyzed while the ape-man stooped and gathered up the lion skin. They saw him turn then and walk back into the shadows {{at the far end of}} the village.

60|$|It is {{impossible}} to say how, short of independence, Great Britain could have improved upon these terms, and {{it has already been}} shown that to offer independence would mean having to fight the war over again. It has been suggested that Great Britain might have offered a definite date upon which representative institutions should <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>force,</b> but such a promise must be disingenuous, for it must evidently depend not upon a date, but upon the state of the country. The offers of loans to the farmers towards the stocking and rebuilding the farms were surely generous to our defeated foes, and, indeed, it is clear now that in some respects our generosity went too far, and that the interests of the Empire would have suffered severely had these terms been accepted. To have given more would certainly seem not to have offered peace, but to have implored it.|$|E

We have had no news since, for even the wire to Colenso has been cut, and for {{anything}} we know the place may be in possession of the Boers. We have a little fort here, and have been throwing up entrenchments, but if they come in any force {{there is not much}} hope of our getting off. We have an armored train, which yesterday ran to within a mile or so of Colenso without being interfered with, though several parties of the enemy could be seen in the distance. I have great hopes that we shall get half a battalion up from Maritzburg to-morrow; if so, by loopholing the houses and throwing up some breastworks, {{we ought to be able}} to keep the Boers out of the place, unless they <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>force.</b> At any rate, I should advise you to scout next time beyond the Mooi River and to make Maritzburg your head-quarters. So far as we know the Boers have not yet gone beyond that river, and any news of their doing so would certainly be of value. You have done marvellously well in getting away from that party you met, but you might not be so lucky next time, for as they push on they are sure in a short time to be strong all over the country between the Tugela and the Mooi." ...|$|E

30|$|The welfare {{effects of}} three {{regional}} trade agreements {{are not only}} heterogeneous among trade agreements but also heterogeneous within the member countries of an agreement. The welfare losses from the removal of SAFTA are higher on the member countries in comparison to two others RTA. In case of the joint agreement of SAFTA and AFTA, the welfare effect is lower. The intuition is explained before. When a member country of SAFTA and a member country (e.g., Brunei Darussalam and Nepal) of AFTA didn’t have trade agreement with each other before, they will gain significant amount of GDP if SAFTA and AFTA <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>force</b> together.
