40|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>casting</b> is a forming method {{which has}} been known for a long time. This forming {{technique}} has been accepted more and more in the sanitary ware production over the last fifteen years due its clearly higher productivity as compared with plaster mould slip casting. However the application of <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> in the field of non-clay ceramics is very limited and under development. A laboratory <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> machine was used for casting of aqueous silicon nitride slips. Several commercial polymethylmethacrylate materials were applied as the filtering and moulding material. The penetration of fine powder particles into the mould was avoided by partially flocculation of the slips. With the partially flocculated slips lower green densities were reached (maximum 54 per cent) compared with <b>pressure</b> <b>cast</b> deflocculated slips (maximum 63 per cent). In both cases the slip pressure was varied in the range 1 MPa - 3 MPa and it did not significantly influenced the green density. The bending strength of the sintered samples was between 700 and 800 MPa and it is consequently lower than the strength of dry pressed samples. Large pores because of a inhomogeneous distribution of the polyacrylate binder were detected as defects in the microstructure. Further research work is necessary to show the principle benefit of this wet forming method to advantage also for the non-clay ceramic powders...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} made to {{determine}} {{the conditions under which}} the optimum droplet size distribution (ie., narrowest size range with a minimum of fines and over-sized agglomerates), is generated in sprays from <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pressure</b> nozzles. A range of non-Newtonian detergent slurries were tested but the results are of wider application and parallel work was undertaken with water, ionic solutions and chalk slurries. Six <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pressure</b> nozzles were used and the drop-size distributions correlated as a function of fluid properties, pressure, fiowrate, feed temperature, and nozzle characteristics. Measurements were made using a Malvern Particle Size Anayser slung across a specially-designed transparent tower section of approximately 1. 2 m diameter in order to reduce obscuration caused by the spray and improve existing droplet sizing techniques. The results obtained were based upon the Rosin-Rammler distribution model and the Size Analyser provided a direct print-out of size distribution and the parameters characterising it. A Spraying System nozzle, AAASSTC 8 - 8, produced the optimum spray distribution with the detergent slurry at a temperature of 60 °C whilst operating at 1200 psi. With other fluids the Delevan 2. 2 SJ nozzle produced the optimum spray distribution operating at 1200 psi but with the Spraying Systems nozzles there was no clear-cut optimum set of conditions, ie. the nozzle and pressure varied depending upon the fluid being sprayed. The mechanisms of liquid sheet break-up and droplet dispersion were investigated in specially-constructed, scaled-up, transparent nozzles. A mathematical model of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pressure</b> nozzle atomisation was developed based upon fundamental operating parameters rather than resorting to empirical correlations. This enabled theoretical predictions to be made over a wide range of operating conditions and nozzle types. The model predictions for volumetric fiowrate, liquid sheet length and air core diameter showed good agreement with the experimentally determined results. However, the model predicted smaller droplet sizes than were produced experimentally due to inaccuracies identified in the initial assumptions...|$|R

40|$|Turbulence of flows is the {{physical}} {{reason for the}} increase of the hydraulic resistance inside pipes and channels. Identification of turbulence suppression methods, aimed at reduction of the hydraulic resistance, constitutes an important challenge. The authors discuss the feasibility of suppression of the near-wall turbulence in pipes using {{the rotation of the}} flow. The authors argue that the centrifugal force agitated by the flow rotation is the factor capable of depressing the turbulence and stabilizing the near-wall flow. The authors have proven the hypothesis that the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pressure</b> can suppress turbulent fluctuations. The authors compared pulsating and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pressure</b> values to derive the criterial condition of turbulence suppression using flow rotation. Flow rotation can be generated by internal spiral finning. Dependence of the spiral step on the hydraulic resistance coefficient is identified. The calculation of the spiral finning step in a pipe having smooth walls is performed for different values of the Reynolds number. Calculations prove that the total resistance decline may exceed 30 %. Experimental verification of calculations is need.

DesignArticular cartilage was harvested from a rabbit. A cell suspension was then prepared, and transferred in 1 ml aliquots to polypropylene tubes. After 48 h of incubation, <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pressure</b> (6. 9 MPa) was applied every 24 h. Changes in morphology, expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) for insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and type II collagen, cell number, wet weight and protein concentration were evaluated. ResultsMicroscopically, formation of chondrocyte clusters was seen in the cultures subjected to stress. Ultrastructurally, collagen fibers were seen to run parallel to the cytoplasmic surface of the stressed chondrocytes. The peak of IGF-I mRNA expression was seen on day 5, whereas type II collagen mRNA expression peaked on day 14. Cell number, wet weight and protein concentration were significantly increased in the stressed cultures. ConclusionsThese results suggest that mechanical stress might affect the arrangement of collagen fibers and the IGF-I activity of chondrocytes cultured in a tube, thus influencing chondrocyte proliferation and increasing the volume of the extracellular matrix.
