5|$|Congress {{passed a}} new {{counterfeiting}} statute in 1816 when it created the Second Bank of the United States. In United States v. Turner (1833), interpreting the new act, the <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> offense of counterfeiting was committed {{even if the}} signatures forged were those of the wrong bank officers. But, in United States v. Brewster (1833), the <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> crime applied only to counterfeit bills, not counterfeit notes.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court {{construed}} {{the elements}} of the fitting out offense. First, the <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> offense of fitting out a vessel for slave trading could be committed even if the owner of the vessel did not personally fit it out. Second, the <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> statute could be violated by a partial fitting out (as opposed to a complete fitting out) of a vessel for that purpose. Third, the Court held thatsince slave trading was a misdemeanorthere was no distinction between principal and accessory. Fourth, the Court held that, for the statute to be violated, the fitting out must have occurred within the United States. Finally, the <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> statute's mens rea required that the owner intend to cause the vessel to be used for slave trading, as opposed to intending that the vessel be used for slave trading (by some third party).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{academic}} {{suggestions to}} the contrary, in Salinas v. United States (1997), the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> transaction itself need not involve federal funds. The $5,000 transactional amount may be satisfied by {{the value of}} intangible goods or services.|$|E
2500|$|Gartside v IRC {{concerned}} a non-exhaustive discretionary trust; however, in Re Weir's Settlement [...] 1 Ch 657 and Sainsbury v IRC [...] Ch 712, <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> same analysis was equally applicable to exhaustive discretionary trusts.|$|R
50|$|In O'Loughlin v Chief Constable of Essex (1997), <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{entry of}} a {{premises}} under section 17 PACE to arrest O'Loughlin's wife for criminal damage was unlawful because under PACE, anyone {{present on the}} premises must be given the reason for entry.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> thus <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{denial of}} {{benefits}} violate equal protection.|$|R
5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no {{subjected to}} the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims. First, the <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required {{no more than the}} state's seal to be authenticated. Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.|$|E
5|$|On June 28, 2012, {{a divided}} Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Stolen Valor Act's {{prohibition}} against {{making false statements}} of having been awarded a military medal violated the First Amendment. However, the six justices in the majority could not agree on a single rationale for the decision.|$|E
5|$|The High <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Minister's {{order to}} {{prohibit}} all publications by WTBTS was not excessive. Any order {{other than a}} total blanket order {{would have been impossible}} to monitor administratively. Therefore, the fact that the contents of one publication were unobjectionable did not, by itself, make the ban unreasonable.|$|E
50|$|Repurposing a work to aid {{identification}} of the base work is also generally transformative. In Kelly v. Ariba Soft and Perfect 10 v. Google, <b>the</b> respective <b>courts</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> creation and use of thumbnails to allow users of a search engine to easily browse through images returned by their search was transformative.|$|R
50|$|State v. Anderson, 2 Tenn. 6 (1804), {{was a case}} {{decided by}} <b>the</b> Tennessee Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>that</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> intent to kill {{necessary}} to distinguish murder from manslaughter need only to be formed a moment before the act.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Canadian <b>courts</b> have <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> offence {{consists}} of two distinct elements: ...|$|R
5|$|The Lines International {{conditions}} were applied {{by a different}} High Court judge {{in the case of}} Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009). The plaintiff argued that the Urban Redevelopment Authority ("URA") had not been transparent while processing her application for permission to redevelop her house, or had not given her case genuine consideration. The <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> URA had considered the planning approval application, and had explained to the plaintiff the implications of her proposal and had extended several invitations to discuss the proposal but the plaintiff had declined to amend her redevelopment plans. On these facts, the <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> URA had thoroughly considered the plaintiff's application and had not fettered its discretion.|$|E
5|$|Burton next {{argued that}} his {{prosecution}} violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. Specifically, Burton argued that his acquittal {{on the third}} count in the first trial barred his conviction on the third and seventh counts in the second trial. The Court rejected this argument. The <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> earlier and later counts did not describe the same offense because they named the payor as Mahaney and Rialto, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Central to the {{reversal}} of the Ninth Circuit {{was the fact that}} the state court did not take into account Alvarado's age and experience with law enforcement in the custody analysis. The Court made several findings on this issue. The <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> use of age in custody analysis had not been explicitly required by previous rulings. Inexperience with law enforcement was rejected as well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>the</b> {{district}} <b>court</b> also <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{patent claims}} were invalid for obviousness.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>held</b> further <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{appellant}} {{had taken}} no steps whatsoever to see <b>that</b> <b>the</b> animal {{did not get}} out of its cage while he was engaged in repairing it. He must have foreseen the likelihood of the animal making an attack upon somebody should it get out of the cage. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>held,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> appellant had been rightly convicted.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> as <b>the</b> date of {{settlement}} was uncertain, the option contract was not legally binding.|$|R
5|$|Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case {{decided in}} 2001. The case {{concerned}} {{the extent of}} the government’s power to limit an individual’s complete control of his or her home pending the arrival of a search warrant. A divided <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> search was not unconstitutional because there was a reasonable law-enforcement need to acquire a warrant, namely, to prevent the potential destruction of evidence within the home.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 the Virginia Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city's {{attempt to}} take over the {{business}} properties was illegal. However, the U.S. District Court ruled in favor the city regarding the sign removal. In January 2015, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's ruling. In April 2015, the Institute for Justice asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case as a First Amendment free speech issue.|$|E
5|$|In Fischer v. United States (2000), the <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{jurisdictional}} {{requirement of}} $10,000 {{in federal funds}} can be satisfied by any funds that flow through the organization, for example Medicaid reimbursements which a hospital receives indirectly through the patients. The only requirement is that the funds be traced to a statutory appropriation, and that their receipt be in furtherance of a federal policy.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> trial <b>court</b> {{initially}} <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> enforcement {{provisions of}} the ordinance were invalid under state law.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> also <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> law did {{not violate}} the Fourteenth Amendment. Chief Justice Warren again: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> further <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Briseno test {{employed}} by Texas courts was insufficient {{and was not}} applied meaningfully. Because the State often misused Briseno in areas of diagnosing mental disability in education or employment, and because Briseno was based around [...] "lay" [...] rather than medical diagnosis and understanding of mental disability, {{that it could not}} hold up. To this end, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> using <b>the</b> DSM-V was preferable to using an outdated 1992 precedent.|$|R
5|$|In United States v. More (1805), the <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{ordinary}} {{means of}} appeal, the writ of error, {{could not be}} utilized in criminal cases from the circuit courts. This contributed {{to the importance of}} the certificate of division in criminal cases. The Marshall Court (18011835) heard thirty-one criminal cases arising from certificates of division; the Taney Court (1836–1864), fifteen; the Chase Court (1864–1873), seventeen; the Waite Court (18741888), thirty-eight; and the Fuller Court (18881910), fourteen.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Paul (1832)involving a {{criminal}} burglary at West Point, prosecuted via an 1829 New York statute defining burglary {{in the third}} degreethe <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> assimilative crimes provision was limited to state crimes in force {{at the time of}} the federal statute's enactment. The 1866, 1874, 1898, 1909, 1933, 1935, and 1940 re-enactments of the assimilative crimes offense explicitly incorporated this interpretation of Paul.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Shackleford (1855), the <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> section 30's {{allocation}} of peremptory challenges controlled, {{rather than an}} 1840 statute that required federal jury selection to generally follow state law (and, thus, the prosecutor was given no peremptory challenges in such cases). Ten years later, Congress abrogated Shackleford, granting prosecutors five peremptory challenges in treason and capital cases (and two in non-capital felony cases); the 1865 act left the defendant's number of peremptory challenges unchanged.|$|E
50|$|In <b>that</b> case, <b>The</b> National Chronicle {{published}} an article about a possible interim government forming to unseat the president. The Liberian National Police then raided the paper's offices, detained some of the staff and shut the paper down on the premise of maintaining security during {{the state of emergency}} caused by the Ebola virus. The PUL filed a petition, but <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> closure was a constitutional matter.|$|R
2500|$|The {{ruling was}} upheld in June 2008 by the Supreme Court of the United States in District of Columbia v. Heller. Both <b>courts</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city's handgun ban {{violated}} {{the right to}} keep and bear arms as protected under the Second Amendment. However, the ruling does not strike down all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> County <b>Court</b> judge <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{payment of}} the debts {{to the group}} of {{creditors}} was invalid. Mr Ling appealed.|$|R
5|$|On appeal, the Court of Appeal {{confirmed}} {{that it had}} to decide the case in accordance with the legal principles laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the effect of section 8B(1) of the ISA was clear. Applying those legal principles, the <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> appellant had failed to prove that her detention had been made for reasons unrelated to national security.|$|E
5|$|Taw {{appealed to}} the High Court against his {{conviction}} on two main grounds. The first involved the admissibility of evidence for his corruption, and, additionally, inconsistencies of such evidence. The second concerned constitutional issues. With regard to the evidential issue, the <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> trial judge made an error in accepting GIC's statements as admissible, and thus ordered Taw's convictions to be set aside.|$|E
5|$|The Aruban prosecutor's office {{attempted}} {{to obtain an}} arrest warrant for Van der Sloot based on the tapes; however, a judge denied the request. The prosecutor appealed the denial, but the appeal failed on February 14, 2008. The appeals <b>court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> statements on the tape were inconsistent with {{evidence in the case}} and were insufficient to hold Van der Sloot.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> {{unanimously}} <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Charter did apply. They {{also decided}} {{that there was}} no violation, but for different reasons.|$|R
25|$|A United States {{district}} <b>court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that,</b> under <b>the</b> Compact of 1820, Poole and {{the other}} plaintiffs were entitled to the land in question.|$|R
50|$|Various United States <b>courts</b> have <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Washitaw Nation is fictional {{and that}} it is not {{recognized}} as a sovereign nation.|$|R
