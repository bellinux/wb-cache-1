40|$|ABSTRACT We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the elec-trostatic properties in the catalytic site of papain (EC 3. 4. 22. 2), an archetype enzyme of the C 1 cys-teine proteinase family, and we investigate their possible role in the formation, stabilization and regulation of the Cys 25 () …His 159 () <b>catalytic</b> <b>ion</b> pair. The electrostatic properties were computed using a reassociation method based in multicen-tered multipolar expansions obtained from ab initio quantum calculations of overlapping protein frag-ments. Solvent effects were introduced by coupling the use of multicentered multipolar expansions to two continuum boundary element methods to solve the Poisson and the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equations. The electrostatic profile found in the proton transfer region of papain showed that this enzyme has a well-defined electrostatic environ-ment to favor the formation and stabilization of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>ion</b> pair. The papain catalytic site electro-static profile can be considered as an electrostatic fingerprint of the papain family with the following characteristics: (i) the presence of a net electric field highly aligned in the (Cys 25) -SG 3 (His 159) -ND 1 di-rection; (ii) the electrostatic profile has a saddle-point character; (iii) it is basically a local environ-mental effect. Furthermore, our analysis describes a possible regulatorymechanism (theESG 3 ND 1 attenu-ation effect) controlling the ion pair reactivity and permits to infer the Asp 57 acidic residue as the most probable candidate to act as the electrostatic modu-lator.

The importance of these positions was suggested by sequence comparisons between the calpain and papain families of cysteine proteinases. Asp- 104 is adjacent to the active-site Cys- 105, and Pro- 287 is adjacent to the active-site Asn- 286 and probably to the active-site His- 262; both Asp- 104 and Pro- 287 are absolutely conserved in the known calpains, but are replaced by highly conserved serine residues in the papains. The single mutants had approx. 10 - 15 % of wild-type activity, due mainly to a decrease in kcat, since Km was only slightly increased. The Pro- 287 [...] >Ser mutation appeared to cause a local perturbation of the catalytic Cys- 105 /His- 262 <b>catalytic</b> <b>ion</b> pair, reducing its efficiency without major effect on the conformation and stability of the enzyme.

40|$|Proton {{translocation}} {{experiments with}} intact cells of Halobacterium salinarium overproducing sensory rhodopsin I (SRI) revealed transport activity of SRI in a two-photon process. The vectoriality of proton translocation depends on pH, being outwardly directed above, and inwardly directed below, pH 5. 7. Activation of the transport cycle requires excitation {{of the initial}} dark state of SRI, SRI 590, to form the intermediate SRI 380. Action spectra identify the photocycle intermediates SRI 380 and SRI 520 as the two photochemically reactive species in the outwardly directed transport process. As shown by flash photolysis experiments, SRI 520 undergoes a so-far unknown photochemical reaction to SRI 380 with a half-time of < 200 micros. Mutation of SRI residue Asp- 76, the residue which {{is equivalent to the}} proton acceptor Asp- 85 in bacteriorhodopsin, to asparagine leads to inactivation of proton translocation. This demonstrates that the underlying mechanisms of proton transport in both retinal proteins share similar features.

Human gelatinase B is a zinc-dependent proteinase and a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family that is involved in inflammation, tissue remodeling, and cancer. We have conducted x-ray absorption spectroscopy, atomic emission, and quantum mechanics studies of natural and activated human gelatinase B. Our results show that the natural enzyme contains one <b>catalytic</b> zinc <b>ion</b> that is central to catalysis. In addition, upon enzyme activation, the catalytic zinc site exhibits a conformation change that results in the expansion of the bond distances around the zinc ion and the replacement of one sulfur with oxygen.

HUH endonucleases are metalloproteins containing conserved His-hydrophobic-His residues at the active site. However, {{the nature of the}} metallic cofactor is not identical in all members of this family. TrwC, a protein involved in the single strand DNA (ssDNA) processing during bacterial conjugation, {{is one of the most}} studied HUH endonucleases at a biochemical and structural level. The physiological cofactors of TrwC relaxase (TrwCR) are Mg+ 2 and Mn+ 2 while other relaxases only use Mn+ 2 as a cofactor. In vitro assays demonstrated that cleavage ability of TrwCRT 87 I is notably reduced in the presence of Mg+ 2. Moreover, structural analysis showed that in TrwCT 87 I the orientation of H 163 has changed. In order to evaluate the role of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>ion</b> in vivo, conjugation assays were performed. Strikingly, no differences in conjugation frequencies were observed when using TrwC T 87 I. Thus, TrwC probably has evolved to be active using Mg+ 2 or Mn+ 2 as cofactors to increase the probability to find an appropriate metal in the conjugative environment. These findings open a new path for modification of cofactor specificity and de novo protein design. Máster en Biología Molecular y Biomedicin...|$|E

Though flips occurred for several side-chain residues (Ile 492, Tyr 505, Phe 506) in the active site toward the binary (inactive) conformation and partial DNA motion toward the binary position occurred without the incoming nucleotide, large-scale subdomain motions were not observed in any trajectory from the ternary complex regardless {{of the presence of}} the <b>catalytic</b> <b>ion.</b> Simulations from the binary state with incoming nucleotide exhibit more thumb subdomain motion, particularly in the loop containing b-strand 8 in the thumb, but closing occurred only in the Ile 492 Ala mutant trajectory started from the binary state with incoming nucleotide and both ions.

40|$|Peptide {{deformylase}} (PDF) inhibitors have {{a strong}} potential {{to be used as}} a new class of antibiotics. However, recent studies have shown that the mitochondria of most eukaryotes, including humans, contain an essential PDF, PDF 1 A. The crystal structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana PDF 1 A (AtPDF 1 A), considered representative of PDF 1 As in general, has been determined. This structure displays several similarities to that of known bacterial PDFs. AtPDF 1 A behaves as a dimer, with the C-terminal residues responsible for linking the two subunits. This arrangement is similar to that of Leptospira interrogans PDF, the only other dimeric PDF identified to date. AtPDF 1 A is the first PDF for which zinc has been identified as the <b>catalytic</b> <b>ion.</b> However, the zinc binding pocket does not differ from the binding pockets of PDFs with iron rather than zinc. The crystal structure of AtPDF 1 A in complex with a substrate analog revealed that the substrate binding pocket of PDF 1 A displays strong modifications. The S 1 ' binding pocket is significantly narrower, due to the creation of a floor from residues present in all PDF 1 As but not in bacterial PDFs. A true S 3 ' pocket is created by the residues of a helical CD-loop, which is very long in PDF 1 As. Finally, these modified substrate binding pockets modify the position of the substrate in the active site. These differences provide guidelines for the design of bacterial PDF inhibitors that will not target mitochondrial PDFs...|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{conformational}} changes {{occur within}} the enzyme that aid catalysis. In human α-enolase, the substrate is rotated into position upon binding to the enzyme due to {{interactions with the}} two <b>catalytic</b> magnesium <b>ions,</b> Gln167, and Lys396.

In addition to coordination with the <b>catalytic</b> magnesium <b>ions,</b> the pKa of the substrate’s alpha hydrogen is also lowered due to protonation of the phosphoryl group by His159 and its proximity to Arg374. Arg374 also causes Lys345 in the active site to become deprotonated, which primes Lys345 for {{its role in the}} mechanism.|$|R

The BOND Zinc Expert Panel recommends three measurements for estimating zinc status: dietary zinc intake, plasma zinc concentration (PZC), and the height-for-age of growing infants and children. The amount of dietary zinc potentially available for absorption, which requires an estimate of dietary zinc and phytate, can be used to identify individuals and populations at risk of zinc deficiency. PZCs respond to severe dietary zinc restriction and to zinc supplementation; they also change with shifts in whole body zinc balance and clinical signs of zinc deficiency. PZC cutoffs are available to identify individuals and populations at risk of zinc deficiency. However, there are limitations in using PZC to assess zinc status. PZC respondsless to additional zinc provided in food than to a supplement administered between meals, there is considerable inter-individual variability in PZC with changes in dietary zinc, and PZC is influenced by recent meal consumption, the time of day, inflammation, and certain drugs and hormones. Insufficient data are available on hair, urinary, nail, and blood cell zinc responses to changes in dietary zinc to recommend these biomarkers for assessing zinc status. Of the potential functional indicators of zinc, growth is the only one recommended. Because pharmacologic zinc doses are unlikely to enhance growth, a growth response to supplemental zinc is interpreted as indicating pre-existing zinc deficiency. Other functional indicators reviewed, but not recommended for assessing zinc nutrition in clinical or field settings because of insufficient information, are the activity or amounts of zinc-dependent enzymes and proteins, and biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation, or DNA damage...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 180 - 187). Peptide nanostructures provide a remarkable toolbox for designing nature inspired smart materials. Synthetic peptide nanomaterials can be tailored with chemical, physical and biological signals to be utilized {{in a wide}} range of applications in biomedicine. With the increasing demand for complex nanostructures with facile preparation methods, bioinspired smart nanomaterials have gained more importance for achieving multifunctional hybrid materials. In particular, biological or chemical cues can be integrated into supramolecular designs to generate bioactive materials. This thesis describes nature inspired combinatorial methods for designing peptide nanostructures, which display catalytic and biologically functional moieties. These multifunctional peptide nanostructures were synthesized by using solid phase peptide synthesis. Designed peptide units were in accordance with the relevant biological function and they self-assemble to form nanofibrous networks mimicking the extracellular matrix. This combinatorial approach allows a wide range of applications including artificial catalysis, cell cultivation, biomineralization and live-cell labeling. In this thesis, the self-assembled catalytic and bioactive peptide nanostructures were utilized in artificial enzyme studies, biomineralization and tissue regeneration. The results show that these new artificial enzymes display both catalytic and biological functions of their natural counterparts such as proteins. In the first chapter, basic concepts of self-assembly, artificial catalysis approach, biomineralization and bioactive peptide nanostructures were explained. In the second chapter, multicomponent artificial catalyst model formed by self-assembly was investigated. Designed artificial peptide molecules were characterized structurally and catalytic capability of this de novo system was shown with both model and actual substrate.

40|$|Among various {{methods for}} the {{separation}} of hydrogen containing mixtures, membrane technology {{has received special attention}} due to its simplicity of operation, moderate energy consumption, cost effectiveness, it is environmentally friendly and can be easily coupled with other separation methods. In particular, inorganic membranes exhibit relevant advantages such as high thermal, chemical and mechanical stabilities, minor plasticization and better control of pore size distribution. They can be divided into five main families: metallic and ceramic proton conducting membranes (dense phases), and silica, zeolite and carbon molecular sieve membranes (porous materials). With more than 200 framework types, zeolites possess uniform molecular pore dimensions and unique properties for <b>catalytic,</b> <b>ion</b> exchange, adsorption and membrane applications. This thesis is essentially devoted to zeolite (titanosilicate) membranes for hydrogen and light gases separation. Titanosilicates offer important benefits over the remaining zeolites: they are usually synthesized without organic templates, can be prepared under moderate pH conditions, exhibit novel possibilities of isomorphous framework substitution, and generally offer strong alkalinity. The main objectives of this dissertation were: (i) synthesis and characterization of titanosilicate membranes. The materials structure and morphology were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS); the dynamic characterization of membranes was accomplished by permeation assays with pure gases; (ii) deep analysis of experimental results, with the objective to disclose the mass transport mechanisms that prevail in the membrane; (iii) accurate modeling of permeation data using theoretically sound approaches like the generalized Maxwell-Stefan (MS) formalism; (iv) development of new MS thermodynamic factors to represent the surface diffusion of pure and multicomponent gases through microporous membranes. Here, several important (though less studied) isotherms were tested, the influence of the solid loading upon surface diffusivity was deeply evaluated, and the predictive ability of the whole model was validated. The hydrothermal synthesis and characterization of AM- 2 and AM- 3 powder and supported membranes have been performed. Altogether, ca. thirty and more than one hundred syntheses of AM- 2 and AM- 3 powder, respectively, have been accomplished, and eight AM- 2 and twenty AM- 3 membranes have been prepared on tubular -alumina and stainless-steel supports by seeding and secondary growth. All powders were characterized by XRD and/or SEM, and three AM- 2 and seven AM- 3 membranes were dynamically tested. The permeation of pure gases at programmed temperature and fixed transmembrane pressure drop (P) was carried out in order to evaluate the membranes quality and identify the governing transport mechanisms (e. g. viscous flow, Knudsen regime, surface diffusion, activated gaseous diffusion). Additionally, more than one hundred permeance measurements were conducted at various temperatures and pressures using different gases (H 2, He, N 2, O 2 and CO 2). The best AM- 3 membrane was studied in detail at P= 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5 bar, at fixed and programmed temperatures between 304 and 394 K, using H 2, He, N 2, O 2 and CO 2. The results provided selectivities towards hydrogen up to 3. 5, and disclosed in all cases an activated behavior typical of surface diffusion, a small contribution of viscous flow due to macro-defects, and a minor contribution of Knudsen mechanism due to meso-defects. The gas permeation was accurately modeled using Maxwell-Stefan theory, achieving an average deviation of only 3. 42 % for all molecules. The rigorous MS thermodynamic factors of various relevant isotherms – Toth, Dubinin-Astakhov (DA) and Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) – were derived in this work for the first time, with the objective to model the permeation of pure and mixed gases through zeolite membranes. The DA and DR isotherms received special attention, taking into account they are often adopted to represent the adsorption equilibrium of most industrial adsorbents that possess a welldeveloped porous structure, especially of carbonaceous origin. The MS factors for DA and DR isotherms were validated using equilibrium and flux data for methane/silicalite- 1, ethane/silicalite- 1 and (methane,ethane) / silicalite- 1 systems according to the following procedure: (i) the unary isotherms were fitted to the corresponding data, while their binary expressions were predicted from the previous ones; (ii) the influence of surface loading upon methane and ethane diffusivities was carefully assessed; (iii) the MS diffusion parameters of each gas were obtained from unary permeation data; (iv) the MS counter-sorption diffusivities were then predicted using the Vignes correlation; (v) {{the separation of}} methane/ethane mixtures using the silicalite- 1 membrane was totally predicted using the new MS thermodynamic factors combined with the binary isotherms. The results demonstrated the validity of this approach, particularly if DA isotherm is selected. Besides the main focus of this PhD on membranes, ion exchange experiments and modeling were also included. The removal of ionic contaminants (Cd 2 + and Hg 2 +) from aqueous solutions was studied using synthesized stannosilicate AV- 6 and titanosilicate ETS- 4. In the case of the Cd 2 +/K+/AV- 6 system, the kinetic removal was modeled with Maxwell-Stefan (MS) and Nernst-Plank (NP) equations, while equilibrium was modeled with mass action law and activity coefficients in both solution (Debye-Hu ckel and Pitzer models) and exchanger (Wilson model) phases. The experimental data proved the ion exchange ability of AV- 6 to sorb cadmium(II), and excellent results were achieved for the equilibrium isotherm (deviations around 6. 6 %) and kinetic modeling (MS, 3. 74 %; NP, 3. 71 %). It was shown that the solid phase is clearly non-ideal. The investigation of the ternary system (Cd 2 +,Hg 2 +) /Na+/ETS- 4 confirmed the large capacity of ETS- 4 (5. 44 meq g- 1) and its selectivity towards both toxic metals, particularly Cd 2 +. However, the trends of the ion exchange kinetics were very distinct, because the internal diffusivity of cadmium(II) is higher than that of mercury(II). These results are in accordance with the effective ionic radius of both species, namely, 102 pm for Hg 2 + and only 95 for Cd 2 +. Entre diversos métodos de separação de misturas gasosas contendo hidrogénio, os processos membranares têm recebido uma atenção especial devido à sua simplicidade de operação, consumo moderado de energia, boa relação custo-eficiência, vantagens para o meio ambiente, e podem ser facilmente combinados com outros métodos de separação. Em particular, as membranas inorgânicas exibem vantagens relevantes, podendo citar-se as estabilidades térmica, química e mecânica elevadas, plasticização reduzida e um melhor controlo da distribuição do tamanho dos poros. Estas podem ser divididas em cinco famílias principais: metálicas e cerâmicas densas (membranas densas); e de sílica, zeolíticas e de peneiro molecular de carbono (membranas porosas). Com mais de 200 estruturas, os zeólitos possuem poros uniformes de dimensão molecular e propriedades únicas para aplicações catalíticas, de permuta iónica, de adsorção e membranares. Esta dissertação dedica-se fundamentalmente a membranas zeolíticas (titanossilicatos) para a separação de hidrogénio e gases leves. Os titanossilicatos oferecem vantagens importantes em relação aos restantes zeólitos: são geralmente sintetizados sem agentes orgânicos estruturantes e sob condições moderadas de pH, exibem novas possibilidades de substituição isomórfica da matriz, e oferecem geralmente uma forte alcalinidade. Os objetivos principais desta dissertação foram: (i) síntese e caracterização de membranas de titanossilicatos. A estrutura dos materiais e a sua morfologia foram examinadas por difração de raios-X (DRX) e microscopia eletrónica de varrimento acoplada a espectroscopia de energia dispersiva de raios-X (SEM/EDS). A caracterização dinâmica das membranas foi efetuada com ensaios de permeação utilizando gases puros; (ii) análise aprofundada dos resultados experimentais, com o objetivo de compreender os mecanismos de transporte de massa que prevalecem na membrana; (iii) modelação rigorosa dos dados de permeação, seguindo abordagens como o formalismo de Maxwell-Stefan (MS); (iv) derivação de novos fatores termodinâmicos de MS para representar a difusão superficial de gases puros e misturas através de membranas microporosas. Foram investigadas isotérmicas importantes, (mesmo que pouco utilizadas na literatura), a dependência da difusividade superficial com a concentração no sólido, e a capacidade preditiva de todo o modelo. A síntese hidrotérmica e a caracterização dos titanossilicatos AM- 2 e AM- 3 foram efetuadas com o material na forma de pó e suportado em membranas. Realizaram-se cerca de trinta sínteses de cristais de AM- 2 e mais de uma centena de AM- 3, para além de oito membranas de AM- 2 e vinte membranas de AM- 3 suportadas em tubos de -alumina e de aço inoxidável, recorrendo ao método do crescimento secundário. Todos os cristais obtidos foram caracterizados por DRX e/ou S SEM, e testaram-se dinamicamente três SEM membranas de AM- 2 e sete membranas de AM- 3. A permeação de gases puros a temperatura programada e a pressão transmembranar fixa (P) foi realizada com o objetivo de avaliar a qualidade das membranas e identificar os mecanismos de transporte envolvidos (fluxo viscoso, regime de Knudsen, difusão superficial, difusão gasosa ativada). Foram concluídas mais de uma centena de medições de permeação a várias temperaturas e pressões usando gases diferentes (H 2, He, N 2, O 2 e CO 2). A melhor membrana de AM- 3 foi estudada em detalhe para P = 0, 5, 1, 0 e 1, 5 bar, a temperatura fixa e a temperatura programada entre 304 e 394 K, usando H 2, He, N 2, O 2 e CO 2. Os resultados obtidos evidenciaram seletividades para o hidrogénio até 3, 5, comportamento ativado típico de difusão superficial em todos os casos, uma pequena contribuição de fluxo viscoso devido a macrodefeitos e uma contribuição residual do mecanismo de Knudsen atribuível a meso-defeitos. A permeação gasosa foi modelada rigorosamente usando o formalismo de Maxwell-Stefan, apresentando um desvio médio de apenas 3, 42 % para todas as moléculas simultaneamente. Os fatores termodinâmicos de MS para as isotérmicas de Toth, Dubinin- Astakhov (DA) e Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) foram derivados neste trabalho, com o objetivo de modelar a permeação de gases puros e misturas através de membranas zeolíticas. As isotérmicas de DA e DR receberam uma atenção especial, tendo em conta que são frequentemente adotadas para representar o equilíbrio de adsorção da maioria dos adsorventes industriais que têm uma estrutura porosa bem definida, especialmente com origem carbonácea. Os fatores de Maxwell-Stefan para DA e DR foram validados com dados experimentais de equilíbrio e de fluxo dos sistemas metano/silicalite- 1, etano/silicalite- 1 e (metano,etano) /silicalite- 1 de acordo com o seguinte procedimento: (i) os parâmetros das isotérmicas dos gases puros foram ajustados aos dados correspondentes, e as isotérmicas binárias foram previstas a partir das anteriores; (ii) a influência da concentração do sólido sobre as difusividades superficiais do metano e do etano foi analisada cuidadosamente; (iii) os parâmetros de difusão de MS de cada gás foram obtidos a partir dos dados de permeação mono-componente; (iv) os coeficientes de difusão multicomponente de MS foram estimados com a correlação de Vignes; (v) a separação de misturas metano/etano usando uma membrana de silicalite- 1 foi totalmente prevista com recurso aos novos fatores termodinâmicos de MS combinados com as isotérmicas binárias. Os resultados comprovaram a validade desta abordagem, especialmente no caso da isotérmica de DA. Apesar de a área principal deste doutoramento estar relacionada com membranas, foram incluídas experiências de permuta iónica e sua modelação. A remoção de contaminantes tóxicos (Cd 2 + e Hg 2 +) de soluções aquosas foi estudada usando o estanhossilicato AV- 6 e o titanossilicato ETS- 4. No caso do sistema Cd 2 +/K+/AV- 6, a cinética de remoção foi modelada com as equações de Maxwell-Stefan (MS) e de Nernst-Plank (NP), enquanto o equilíbrio foi modelado com a lei da ação das massas expressa em atividades, usando-se coeficientes de atividade na solução (modelos de Debye-Hückel e Pitzer) e no permutador (modelo de Wilson). Os dados experimentais evidenciaram a capacidade de permuta do AV- 6 para sorver cádmio(II) e obtiveram-se resultados excelentes para a isotérmica de equilíbrio (desvios de 6, 6 %) e para a modelação cinética (MS = 3, 74 %; NP = 3, 71 %). Ficou ainda demonstrado que a fase sólida é claramente não-ideal. A investigação do sistema ternário (Cd 2 +,Hg 2 +) /Na+/ETS- 4 confirmou a elevada capacidade do ETS- 4 (5, 44 meq g- 1) e a sua seletividade para os dois metais tóxicos, particularmente para o Cd 2 +. Contudo, o comportamento das cinéticas de permuta iónica foi muito distinto, uma vez que a difusividade interna do cádmio(II) é superior à do mercúrio(II). Estes resultados estão de acordo com o raio iónico efetivo de ambas as espécies, ou seja, 102 pm para o Hg 2 + e apenas 95 pm para o Cd 2 +. Doutoramento em Engenharia Químic...|$|E

The calcium ion binding play {{important role in}} stabilizing the secondary structure. MMP7 has a shallow hydrophobic substrate-binding pocket. In contrast to MMP9 which has the longest hinge, MMP7 lacks hemopexin and {{does not have a}} hinge. Instead, MMP7 contains a variable C-terminal hemopexin-like domain facilitates substrate specificity. The protein of MMP7 is secreted as zymogen. The prodoamin of MMP7 contains an approximately 9 kD highly conserved “cysteine switch” PRCGXPD sequence near the C-terminal containing cysteine residues. Cysteine residues bind to the catalytic zinc keeping the protein latent. The dissociation of cysteine -Zinc coordination starts from the cleavage of the first 30 amino acids of the prodomain, which leads to a conformation change, and further results in autoproteolysis and the cleavage of the whole prodomain at Glu-Tyr site. According to Woessner et al., the Mr of MMP7 is 28,000 for the latent form and 19,000 Mr for the active form after the cleavage of its prodomain.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Many enzymes use metal ions {{within their}} active sites to achieve {{enormous}} rate acceleration. Understanding how metal ions mediate catalysis requires elucidation of metal ion interactions {{with both the}} enzyme and the substrate(s). The three-dimensional arrangement determined by X-ray crystallography provides a powerful starting point for identifying ground state interactions, but only functional studies can establish and interrogate transition state interactions. The Tetrahymena group I ribozyme is a paradigm {{for the study of}} RNA catalysis, and previous work using atomic mutagenesis and quantitative analysis of metal ion rescue behavior identified <b>catalytic</b> metal <b>ions</b> making five contacts with the substrate atoms. Here, we have combined atomic mutagenesis with site-specific phosphorothioate substitutions in the ribozyme backbone to establish transition state ligands on the ribozyme for one of the <b>catalytic</b> metal <b>ions,</b> referred to as MA. We identified the pro-SP oxygen atoms at nucleotides C 208, A 304, and A 306 as ground state ligands for MA, verifying interactions suggested by the Azoarcus crystal structures. We further established that these interactions are present in the chemical transition state, a conclusion that requires functional studies, such as those carried out herein. Elucidating these active site connections is a crucial step toward an in-depth understanding of how specific structural features of the group I intron lead to catalysis...|$|R
40|$|Endonucleolytic {{processing}} of precursor tRNAs (ptRNAs) by RNase P yields 3 ′-OH and 5 ′-phosphate termini, {{and at least}} two metal ions are thought to be essential for catalysis. To determine if the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by bacterial RNase P (RNAs) involves stabilization of the 3 ′-oxyanion leaving group by direct coordination to one of the <b>catalytic</b> metal <b>ions,</b> ptRNA substrates with single 3 ′-S-phosphorothiolate linkages at the RNase P cleavage site were synthesized. With a 3 ′-S-phosphorothiolate-modified ptRNA carrying a 7 nt 5 ′-flank, a complete shift of the cleavage site to the next unmodified phosphodiester in the 5 ′-direction was observed. Cleavage at the modified linkage was not restored in the presence of thiophilic metal ions, such as Mn 2 + or Cd 2 +. To suppress aberrant cleavage, we also constructed a 3 ′-S-phosphorothiolate-modified ptRNA with a 1 nt 5 ′-flank. No detectable cleavage of this substrate was seen in reactions catalyzed by RNase P RNAs from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, independent of the presence of thiophilic metal ions. Ground state binding of modified ptRNAs was not impaired, suggesting that the 3 ′-S-phosphorothiolate modification specifically prevents formation of the transition state, possibly by excluding <b>catalytic</b> metal <b>ions</b> from the active site...|$|R

(In these formulae, "n" identifies the noncatalytic zinc ion and "c" identifies the <b>catalytic</b> metal <b>ion.)</b> X-ray data were collected for H 4 Zn(n) 2 LADH to 2. 7 -A resolution and for Co(c) 2 Zn(n) 2 LADH to 2. 4 -A resolution. Difference Fourier maps demonstrate clearly that the <b>catalytic</b> zinc <b>ions</b> are removed in H 4 Zn(n) 2 LADH, whereas the noncatalytic zinc ions are still present. A 2. 5 -A shift in the sulphur position of cysteine- 46 and a slight torsion of the imidazole ring of histidine- 67 are the only changes in the protein structure that could be detected {{when compared to the}} native zinc enzyme. The structure of Co(c) 2 Zn(n) 2 LADH is essentially {{the same as that of}} the native enzyme.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Thermoanaerobacter brockii alcohol {{dehydrogenase}} (TbADH) is a zinc-dependent NADP + / H-linked class enzyme that reversibly catalyzes the oxidation of secondary alcohols to their corresponding ketones. Cobalt substitution studies of {{other members of}} the {{alcohol dehydrogenase}} (ADH) family showed that the cobalt-containing ADHs have a similar active site structure but slightly decreased activity compared to wild-type zinc ADHs. In contrast, the cobalt-substituted TbADH (Co-TbADH) exhibits an increase in specific activity compared to the native enzyme [Bogin, O., Peretz, M., and Burstein, Y. (1997) Protein Sci. 6, 450 - 458]. However, the structural basis underlying this behavior is not yet clear. To shed more light on this issue, we studied the local structure and electronics at the catalytic metal site in Co-TbADH by combining X-ray absorption (XAS) and quantum chemical calculations. Importantly, we show that the first metal-ligand coordination shell of Co-TbADH is distorted compared to its native tetrahedral coordination shell and forms an octahedral structure. This is mediated presumably by the addition of two water molecules and results in more positively charged <b>catalytic</b> metal <b>ions.</b> Recently, we have shown that the metal-ligand coordination number of the zinc ion in TbADH changes dynamically during substrate turnover. These structural changes are associated with a higher coordination number of the native <b>catalytic</b> zinc <b>ion</b> and the consequent buildup of a positive charge. Here we propose that the accumulation of...|$|R
40|$|Despite their {{key roles}} in many normal and {{pathological}} processes, the molecular details by which zinc-dependent proteases hydrolyze their physiological substrates remain elusive. Advanced theoretical analyses have suggested reaction models {{for which there}} is limited and controversial experimental evidence. Here we report the structure, chemistry and lifetime of transient metal–protein reaction intermediates evolving during the substrate turnover reaction of a metalloproteinase, the tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE). TACE controls multiple signal transduction pathways through the proteolytic release of the extracellular domain of a host of membrane-bound factors and receptors. Using stopped-flow x-ray spectroscopy methods together with transient kinetic analyses, we demonstrate that TACE's <b>catalytic</b> zinc <b>ion</b> undergoes dynamic charge transitions before substrate binding to the metal ion. This indicates previously undescribed communication pathways taking place between distal protein sites and the enzyme catalytic core. The observed charge transitions are synchronized with distinct phases in the reaction kinetics and changes in metal coordination chemistry mediated by the binding of the peptide substrate to the <b>catalytic</b> metal <b>ion</b> and product release. Here we report key local charge transitions critical for proteolysis as well as long sought evidence for the proposed reaction model of peptide hydrolysis.
