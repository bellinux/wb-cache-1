60|$|Gerald {{selected}} a comfortable chair and passed his <b>cigar-case</b> to Kenwyne.|$|E
60|$|So saying, he {{took out}} a <b>cigar-case,</b> and offered it to his companion.|$|E

60|$|Meantime, do you {{remember}} that this peculiar country enjoys paying money for value not received? I am an alien, and {{for the life of me}} I cannot see why six shillings should be paid for eighteen-penny caps, or eight shillings for half-crown <b>cigar-cases.</b> When the country fills up to a decently populated level a few million people who are not aliens will be smitten with the same sort of blindness.|$|R
60|$|A {{letter from}} Miss Calverley {{written in a}} very degage style of {{spelling}} and handwriting, scrawling freely over the filagree paper, and commencing by calling Mr. Harry, her dear Hokey-pokey-fokey, lay on his bed table by his side, amidst keys, sovereigns, <b>cigar-cases,</b> {{and a bit of}} verbena, which Miss Amory had given him, and reminding him of the arrival of the day when he was 'to stand that dinner at the Elefant and Castle, at Richmond, which he had promised;' a card for a private box at Miss Rougemont's approaching benefit, a bundle of tickets for 'Ben Budgeon's night, the North Lancashire Pippin, at Martin Faunce's, the Three-cornered Hat, in St. Martin's Lane; where Conkey Sam, Dick the Nailor, and Deadman (the Worcestershire Nobber), would put on the gloves, and the lovers of the good old British sport were invited to attend'--these and sundry other memoirs of Mr. Foker's pursuits and pleasure lay on the table by his side when he woke.|$|R
60|$|A low chuckle {{came from}} a corner. The German opened his <b>cigar-case</b> and handed a skinny black cigar to Harvey.|$|E
60|$|In some {{surprise}} the youth put the <b>cigar-case</b> into her hand, and she immediately flung {{it into a}} neighbouring pool.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon me, Mademoiselle," [...] cried Lewis, {{pulling out}} his <b>cigar-case,</b> [...] "nothing would gratify {{me more than}} your {{acceptance}} of--" ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{this time}} there were but two or three young ladies in society endowed with the {{necessary}} qualifications, or who found favour in his eyes. His lordship hesitated in his selection from these beauties. He {{was not in a}} hurry, he was not angry at the notion that Lady Kew (and Miss Newcome with her) hunted him. What else should they do but pursue an object so charming? Everybody hunted him. The other young ladies, whom we need not mention, languished after him still more longingly. He had little notes from these; presents of purses worked by them, and <b>cigar-cases</b> embroidered with his coronet. They sang to him in cosy boudoirs--mamma went out of the room, and sister Ann forgot something in the drawing-room. They ogled him as they sang. Trembling they gave him a little foot to mount them, that they might ride on horseback with him. They tripped along by his side from the Hall to the pretty country church on Sundays. They warbled hymns: sweetly looking at him the while mamma whispered confidentially to him, [...] "What an angel Cecilia is!" [...] And so forth, and so forth--with which chaff our noble bird was by no means to be caught. When he had made up his great mind, that the time was come and the woman, he was ready to give a Marchioness of Farintosh to the English nation.|$|R
6000|$|The {{top drawer}} {{contained}} a complete collection of carpenter's tools in miniature, relics probably of the far-distant {{time when the}} Major was a boy, and when parents or friends had made him a present {{of a set of}} toy tools. The second drawer was filled with toys of another sort--presents made to Major Fitz-David by his fair friends. Embroidered braces, smart smoking-caps, quaint pincushions, gorgeous slippers, glittering purses, all bore witness to the popularity of the friend of the women. The contents of the third drawer were of a less interesting sort: the entire space was filled with old account-books, ranging over a period of many years. After looking into each book, and opening and shaking it uselessly, in search of any loose papers which might be hidden between the leaves, I came to the fourth drawer, and found more relics of past pecuniary transactions in the shape of receipted bills, neatly tied together, and each inscribed at the back. Among the bills I found nearly a dozen loose papers, all equally unimportant. The fifth drawer was in sad confusion. I took out first a loose bundle of ornamental cards, each containing the list of dishes at past banquets given or attended by the Major in London or Paris; next, a box full of delicately tinted quill pens (evidently a lady's gift); next, a quantity of old invitation cards; next, some dog's-eared French plays and books of the opera; next, a pocket-corkscrew, a bundle of cigarettes, and a bunch of rusty keys; lastly, a passport, a set of luggage labels, a broken silver snuff-box, two <b>cigar-cases,</b> and a torn map of Rome. [...] "Nothing anywhere to interest me," [...] I thought, as I closed the fifth, and opened the sixth and last drawer.|$|R
60|$|Just {{when the}} sense of unreality and oppression were strongest upon me, and when I most wanted help, a man sat at my side and began to talk what he called politics. I had chanced to pay about six shillings for a travelling-cap worth {{eighteen}} pence, and he made of the fact a text for a sermon. He {{said that this was}} a rich country and that the people liked to pay two hundred per cent on the value of a thing. They could afford it. He said that the Government imposed a protective duty of from ten to seventy per cent on foreign-made articles, and that the American manufacturer consequently could sell his goods for a healthy sum. Thus an imported hat would, with duty, cost two guineas. The American manufacturer would make a hat for seventeen shillings and sell it for one pound fifteen. In these things, he said, lay the greatness of America and the effeteness of England. Competition between factory and factory kept the prices down to decent limits, but I was never to forget that this people were a rich people, not like the pauper Continentals, and that they enjoyed paying duties. To my weak intellect this seemed rather like juggling with counters. Everything that I have yet purchased costs about twice as much as it would in England, and when native-made is of inferior quality. Moreover, since these lines were first thought of I have visited a gentleman who owned a factory which used to produce things. He owned the factory still. Not a man was in it, but he was drawing a handsome income from a syndicate of firms for keeping it closed in order that it might not produce things. This man said that if protection were abandoned, a tide of pauper labour would flood the country, and as I looked at his factory I thought how entirely better it was to have no labour of any kind whatever, rather than face so horrible a future. Meantime, do you remember that this peculiar country enjoys paying money for value not received. I am an alien, and {{for the life of me}} cannot see why six shillings should be paid for eighteen-penny caps, or eight shillings for half-crown <b>cigar-cases.</b> When the country fills up to a decently populated level a few million people who are not aliens will be smitten with the same sort of blindness.|$|R
60|$|Ignatius Gallaher {{produced}} his <b>cigar-case.</b> The {{two friends}} lit their cigars and puffed {{at them in}} silence until their drinks were served.|$|E
60|$|They adjourned to a {{cushioned}} and glaring buffet, and Buck {{established himself}} slowly and lazily in a seat, {{and pulled out}} his <b>cigar-case.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Snyder, nearly {{exploding}} with wrath, {{extended his}} <b>cigar-case.</b> [...] "Light up, {{and tell me}} all about it," [...] he said, controlling his anger.|$|E
6000|$|... “Sit down,” Clay said, {{taking out}} his <b>cigar-case.</b> “I wrote to Mr. Farquhar, but I’m {{glad to see}} you all. Will you have {{anything}} to drink?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What go any further?" [...] asked Mr. Pasmer, {{sitting down}} and putting {{his hand to the}} pocket that held his <b>cigar-case</b> with the same series of motions.|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{tell you}} how much I thank you for the {{beautiful}} <b>cigar-case,</b> and how seasonable, and friendly, and good, and warm-hearted it looked when I opened it at Gad's Hill. Besides which, it is a <b>cigar-case,</b> and will hold cigars; two crowning merits that I never yet knew to be possessed by any article claiming the same name. For all of these reasons, but more than all because it comes from you, I love it, and send you eighteen hundred and sixty kisses, with one in for the new year.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I may add {{a little}} smoke to your glorious fire, it will be quite perfect. Won't Samson join me?" [...] asked Randal, waiting for permission, <b>cigar-case</b> in hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take the lot," [...] said Felix, {{and shuffled}} into the other's pocket the {{contents}} of his <b>cigar-case.</b> [...] "If you get through one, you'll want the rest. They're pretty good." ...|$|E
6000|$|Slowly she turned, {{holding up}} a small box, and slowly she said, [...] "I brought you a present, just a new <b>cigar-case.</b> I don't know if you'd care to have it--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be frightened. I'll {{stick it}} on your bayonet-point;" [...] and suiting the action to the word, Tom caught the bayonet-point, put the {{passport}} on it, and pulled out his <b>cigar-case.</b>|$|E
60|$|Without answering, {{he changed}} his coat for a silk jacket, {{transferred}} his <b>cigar-case</b> to a pocket in it, and went out. When he had passed the threshold, he hesitated, and returned.|$|E
60|$|When breakfast was over, {{and when}} Mr. Vanstone's hand descended to his pocket {{in search of}} his <b>cigar-case,</b> Magdalen rose; looked {{significantly}} at Miss Garth; and followed her father into the hall.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Swann {{stared at}} him, {{and then with}} a {{friendly}} [...] "good morning" [...] departed. Half-way along the passage he stopped, and retracing his steps produced his <b>cigar-case</b> and offered the astonished boarding-master a cigar.|$|E
60|$|The {{suspended}} trunk still oscillated, and a faint clinking {{came up with}} {{a hoarse}} murmur of voices from the hollow. Then there was silence, and Devine, who pointed to a fallen cedar, took out his <b>cigar-case.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I noted {{a shadow}} fall over his well-satisfied expression, a {{momentary}} hesitation in closing his <b>cigar-case.</b> But he ended by {{putting it in}} his pocket jauntily. A placid voice uttered in the doorway: [...] "That's quite correct, Captain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So," [...] he said, [...] "it was you." [...] He {{walked into}} the room and laid the light coat that he had been {{carrying}} over his arm upon the table. He drew a <b>cigar-case</b> from his waistcoat pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "Try one of these," [...] {{said the}} Admiral, {{holding out his}} <b>cigar-case.</b> [...] "They are not bad. I got them on the Mosquito Coast. I was {{thinking}} of signaling to you, but you seemed so very happy out there." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lane {{handed me}} his <b>cigar-case</b> when the lad strolled {{out of the}} door, but I {{was in no mood}} to assume an unfelt cordiality. [...] "I am not {{inclined}} for smoking. Hadn't we better come straight to business?" [...] I said.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{second night}} {{he was on the}} job he walks down from his corner to the <b>cigar-case</b> and calls for cigarettes. The {{customers}} at the tables all snicker out loud to show their acquaintance with history. The boss is on.|$|E
6000|$|Don't suppose, however, that I was quit of Mr. Franklin on such easy {{terms as}} these. Drifting again, {{out of the}} morning-room into the hall, he found {{his way to the}} offices next, smelt my pipe, and was {{instantly}} reminded that he had been simple enough to give up smoking for Miss Rachel's sake. In the twinkling of an eye, he burst in on me with his <b>cigar-case,</b> and came out strong on the one everlasting subject, in his neat, witty, unbelieving, French way. [...] "Give me a light, Betteredge. Is it conceivable that a man can have smoked as long as I have without discovering that there is a complete system for the treatment of women at the bottom of his <b>cigar-case?</b> Follow me carefully, and I will prove it in two words. You choose a cigar, you try it, and it disappoints you. What do you do upon that? You throw it away and try another. Now observe the application! You choose a woman, you try her, and she breaks your heart. Fool! take a lesson from your <b>cigar-case.</b> Throw her away, and try another!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to {{give him}} more than his fare. So I shall slip my <b>cigar-case</b> into the pocket of this coat," [...] whispered Uncle Ben, as Joel was busy drawing up the boat and getting a stone or two to {{facilitate}} the ladies' landing dryshod.|$|E
6000|$|Flora Schuyler {{nodded as}} though she {{believed}} him, but she determined to leave no room for doubt. [...] "He is in his office," [...] she said. [...] "Have you the deerskin <b>cigar-case</b> you showed us with you? You will remember I {{was interested in the}} Indian embroidery." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hazard: [...] "You can look, if you like. I'm rather {{proud of}} it. There's {{only one other}} thing you can give a man, and I said, 'No, not a <b>cigar-case.</b> Fountain smokes enough already, but if a bath-robe can induce him to wash--'" [...] He goes out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very nice girl." [...] Uncle Chris {{took out}} his <b>cigar-case.</b> [...] "No need to ask if I may, thank goodness." [...] He lit a cigar. [...] "Do you remember, Jill, years ago, when you were quite small, how I used to blow smoke in your face?" ...|$|E
