5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The animal's sense organ is altered when it detects an object. This <b>causes</b> a perceptual {{change in the}} animal's seat of sensation, which Aristotle {{believed}} was the heart, not as we now think the brain. This in turn <b>causes</b> {{a change in the}} heart's heat, which <b>causes</b> a quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration {{in the heat of the}} heart also <b>causes</b> a change in the consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.|$|E
5|$|Tinnitus is not {{a disease}} but a symptom that can result {{from a number of}} {{underlying}} <b>causes.</b> One of the most common <b>causes</b> is noise-induced hearing loss.

40|$|As part {{of their}} {{corporate}} social responsibility, many organizations practice cause-related marketing, in which organizations donate to a chosen <b>cause</b> with every consumer purchase. The extant literature has identified {{the importance of the}} fit between the organization {{and the nature of the}} <b>cause</b> in influencing corporate image, as well as the influence of a connection between the <b>cause</b> and consumer preferences on brand attitudes and brand choice. However, prior research has not addressed which <b>cause</b> composition most appeals to consumers or the impact of <b>cause</b> choice on corporate image. A between-subjects field experiment in the Netherlands examines the influence of three core <b>cause</b> attributes—cause type, <b>cause</b> scope, and <b>cause</b> acuteness—on consumers’ perceptions of corporate image. Furthermore, this experiment examines the extent to which consumer identification with the <b>cause</b> mediates the influence of the <b>cause</b> attributes on corporate image. The findings indicate that identification with the <b>cause</b> leads to more positive evaluations of marketing campaigns for <b>cause</b> type and <b>cause</b> scope. Also, however, our results uncover a negative direct relationship between <b>cause</b> scope and corporate image. <b>Cause</b> acuteness is only marginally influential in corporate image perceptions. By proposing and testing a comprehensive model of the influence of <b>cause</b> attributes on corporate image in cause-related marketing, this article provides important implications and suggests avenues for further research...|$|R
5000|$|The {{point of}} the koan {{is that for the}} {{ordinary}} person the two conflicting views of causality are between falling into <b>cause</b> and effect or not falling into <b>cause</b> and effect, because they dream of being free from <b>cause</b> and effect as being separate from <b>cause</b> and effect.

5000|$|According to Swami Sivananda, in his {{comments}} on the [...] 2.1.9, Adi Shankara describes this as follows: Despite the non-difference of <b>cause</b> and effect, the effect has its self in the <b>cause</b> but not the <b>cause</b> in the effect.The effect is {{of the nature of}} the <b>cause</b> and not the <b>cause</b> the nature of the effect.Therefore the qualities of the effect cannot touch the <b>cause.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the world}} {{we can see that}} things are <b>caused.</b> But it is not {{possible}} for something to be the <b>cause</b> of itself, because this would entail that it exists prior to itself, which is a contradiction.
