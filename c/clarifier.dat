25|$|Completely clear {{filtrate}} {{cannot be}} obtained using belt press filters except in rare circumstances. Thus further treatment {{may be required}} for the filtrate before it is reused or discharged as waste. If the filter is downstream of a <b>clarifier</b> or thickener the filtrate (and wash water) can be recycled back into the <b>clarifier</b> to reduce the required filtrate clarity and allows {{for the use of}} more durable cloths. If recycling or reuse is not an option the filtrate should be discharged subject to legislation and license requirements. Further treatment of clarified water (filtration or chemical treatment) may be required before discharge.|$|E
50|$|The two {{dominant}} forces acting {{upon the}} solid particles in <b>clarifiers</b> are gravity and particle interactions. Disproportional flow {{can lead to}} turbulent and hydraulic instability and potential flow short-circuiting. Installation of perforated baffle walls in modern <b>clarifiers</b> promotes uniform flow across the basin. Rectangular <b>clarifiers</b> are commonly used for high efficiency and low running cost. Improvements of these <b>clarifiers</b> were made to stabilize flow by elongation and narrowing of the tank.|$|R
5000|$|Wastewater {{flows from}} the Headworks {{facility}} into three distribution boxes. The wastewater flows from each distribution box into designated primary <b>clarifiers.</b> The distribution of the wastewater is as follows: [...] "A" [...] distribution box dispenses water to D, E, F, and G primary <b>clarifiers,</b> [...] "B" [...] distribution box dispenses water to H, I, J, K, and L primary <b>clarifiers,</b> and [...] "C" [...] distribution box dispenses water to M, N, O, P, and Q primary <b>clarifiers.</b> The sludge that settles out {{to the bottom of}} the <b>clarifiers</b> and the scum that is removed from the top of the <b>clarifiers</b> is then pumped to one of two sludge blending facility tanks, where it is mixed before being pumped to anaerobic digesters.|$|R
5000|$|Lamella <b>clarifiers</b> {{are also}} used in the {{municipal}} wastewater treatment processes. The most common wastewater application for lamella <b>clarifiers</b> is {{as part of the}} tertiary treatment stage. Lamella <b>clarifiers</b> can be integrated into the treatment process or stand-alone units can be used to increase the flow through existing water treatment plants. One option for integrating lamella <b>clarifiers</b> into existing plants is for conventional or sludge blanket <b>clarifiers</b> to be upgraded by attaching a bundle of inclined plates or tubes before the overflow in the so-called [...] "clear water zone". This can increase the settling area by two-fold resulting in a decrease in the solids loading in the overflow.|$|R
25|$|The {{sludge blanket}} is {{measured}} {{from the bottom}} of the <b>clarifier</b> to the level of settled solids in the clarifier's water column; this, in large plants, can be done up to three times a day.|$|E
25|$|The MCRT is {{the total}} mass (lbs) of mixed liquor {{suspended}} solids in the aerator and <b>clarifier</b> divided by the mass flow rate (lbs/day) of {{mixed liquor suspended solids}} leaving as WAS and final effluent.|$|E
25|$|Sequencing batch {{reactors}} (SBRs) treat wastewater {{in batches}} {{within the same}} vessel. This means that the bioreactor and final <b>clarifier</b> are not separates in space but in a timed sequence. The installation consists {{of at least two}} identically equipped tanks with a common inlet, which can be switched between them. While one tank is in settle/decant mode the other is aerating and filling.|$|E
50|$|Lamella <b>clarifiers</b> {{can be used}} in a {{range of}} {{industries}} including mining and metal finishing, as well as used to treat groundwater, industrial process water and backwash from sand filters. Lamella <b>clarifiers</b> are ideal for applications where the solids loading is variable and solids sizing is fine and are more common than conventional <b>clarifiers</b> at many industrial sites due to their smaller footprint.|$|R
50|$|Settling basins and <b>clarifiers</b> can be {{designed}} as long rectangles (Figure 1.a), that are hydraulically more stable and easier to control for large volumes. Circular <b>clarifiers</b> (Fig. 1.b) work as a common thickener (without the usage of rakes), or as upflow tanks (Fig. 1.c).|$|R

25|$|Wastewater is {{collected}} {{and sent to}} the City of Red Deer wastewater treatment plant which treats the sewage with a combination of grit traps, a primary <b>clarifier,</b> biological nutrient removal bioreactors, secondary clarifiers, and UV disinfection. Solids generated from the treatment process are treated using dissolved air flotation, anaerobic digestion, and biosolids lagoons. Treated effluent is then discharged back into the Red Deer River downstream of the water treatment plant.|$|E
25|$|Waters {{exiting the}} {{flocculation}} basin may enter the sedimentation basin, also called a <b>clarifier</b> or settling basin. It {{is a large}} tank with low water velocities, allowing floc to settle to the bottom. The sedimentation basin is best located close to the flocculation basin so the transit between the two processes does not permit settlement or floc break up. Sedimentation basins may be rectangular, where water flows from end to end, or circular where flow is from the centre outward. Sedimentation basin outflow is typically over a weir so only a thin top layer of water—that furthest from the sludge—exits.|$|E
25|$|Activated sludge is {{a common}} suspended-growth method of {{secondary}} treatment. Activated sludge plants encompass a variety of mechanisms and processes using dissolved oxygen to promote growth of biological floc that substantially removes organic material. Biological floc is an ecosystem of living biota subsisting on nutrients from the inflowing primary <b>clarifier</b> effluent. These mostly carbonaceous dissolved solids undergo aeration to be broken down and either biologically oxidized to carbon dioxide or converted to additional biological floc of reproducing micro-organisms. Nitrogenous dissolved solids (amino acids, ammonia, etc.) are similarly converted to biological floc or oxidized by the floc to nitrites, nitrates, and, in some processes, to nitrogen gas through denitrification. While denitrification is encouraged in some treatment processes, denitrification often impairs the settling of the floc causing poor quality effluent in many suspended aeration plants. Overflow from the activated sludge mixing chamber is sent to a secondary <b>clarifier</b> where the suspended biological floc settles out while the treated water moves into tertiary treatment or disinfection. Settled floc is returned to the mixing basin to continue growing in primary effluent. Like most ecosystems, population changes among activated sludge biota can reduce treatment efficiency. Nocardia, a floating brown foam sometimes misidentified as sewage fungus, is {{the best known of}} many different fungi and protists that can overpopulate the floc and cause process upsets. Elevated concentrations of toxic wastes including pesticides, industrial metal plating waste, or extreme pH, can kill the biota of an activated sludge reactor ecosystem.|$|E
50|$|Sewage sludge {{treatment}} describes the processes used {{to manage and}} dispose of sewage sludge produced during sewage treatment. Sludge is mostly water with lesser amounts of solid material removed from liquid sewage. Primary sludge includes settleable solids removed during primary treatment in primary <b>clarifiers.</b> Secondary sludge separated in secondary <b>clarifiers</b> includes treated sewage sludge from secondary treatment bioreactors.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Basin {{configuration}} {{and equipment}} design govern whether rectangular secondary <b>clarifiers</b> will experience problems of inadequate sludge transport capacity. The operating factors to be considered, other than peak flows {{which may be}} severe, are the potential for sludge bulking and the higher {{mixed liquor suspended solids}} concentrations and solids retention times employed for biological nutrient removal processes. Rectangular <b>clarifiers</b> longer than 20 m and loaded at more than 3. 5 kg/m 2 day often have sludge transport/ shortcircuiting problems. Shortcircuiting of mixed liquor into the return sludge is a common situation that can be avoided in new designs and easily corrected in existing facilities. A step-by-step design approach is presented as a series of process calculations with graphs. Results from the unmodified and the improved rectangular <b>clarifiers</b> at Phoenix 91 st Avenue wastewater treatment plant, Ariz., are presented...|$|R
25|$|Primary <b>clarifier</b> {{effluent}} {{was discharged}} directly to eutrophic natural wetlands for decades before environmental regulations discouraged the practice. Where adequate land is available, stabilization ponds with constructed wetland ecosystems {{can be built}} to perform secondary treatment separated from the natural wetlands receiving secondary treated sewage. Constructed wetlands resemble fixed-film systems more than suspended growth systems, because natural mixing is minimal. Constructed wetland design uses plug flow assumptions to compute the residence time required for treatment. Patterns of vegetation growth and solids deposition in wetland ecosystems, however, can create preferential flow pathways which may reduce average residence time. Measurement of wetland treatment efficiency is complicated because most traditional water quality measurements cannot differentiate between sewage pollutants and biological productivity of the wetland. Demonstration of treatment efficiency may require more expensive analyses.|$|E
25|$|Rotating {{biological}} contactors (RBCs) are robust mechanical fixed-film {{secondary treatment}} systems capable of withstanding surges in organic load. RBCs were first installed in Germany in 1960 and {{have since been}} developed and refined into a reliable operating unit. The rotating disks support the growth of bacteria and micro-organisms present in the sewage, which break down and stabilize organic pollutants. To be successful, micro-organisms need both oxygen to live and food to grow. Oxygen is obtained from the atmosphere as the disks rotate. As the micro-organisms grow, they build up on the media until they are sloughed off due to shear forces provided by the rotating discs in the sewage. Effluent from the RBC is then passed through a secondary <b>clarifier</b> where the sloughed biological solids in suspension settle as a sludge.|$|E
25|$|A {{little more}} than a year before his death, Minkowski {{introduced}} his geometric interpretation of spacetime to the public on November 5, 1907 in a lecture to the Göttingen Mathematical society with the title, The Relativity Principle (Das Relativitätsprinzip). In the original version of this lecture, Minkowski continued to use such obsolescent terms as the ether, but the posthumous publication in 1915 of this lecture in the Annals of Physics (Annalen der Physik) was edited by Sommerfeld to remove this term. Sommerfeld also edited the published form of this lecture to revise Minkowski's judgement of Einstein from being a mere <b>clarifier</b> of the principle of relativity, to being its chief expositor. On December 21, 1907, Minkowski spoke again to the Göttingen scientific society, and on September 21, 1908, Minkowski presented his famous talk, Space and Time (Raum und Zeit), to the German Society of Scientists and Physicians.|$|E

25|$|Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are {{activated}} sludge systems using a membrane liquid-solid phase separation process. The membrane component uses low pressure microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes and {{eliminates the need}} for a secondary <b>clarifier</b> or filtration. The membranes are typically immersed in the aeration tank; however, some applications utilize a separate membrane tank. One of the key benefits of an MBR system is that it effectively overcomes the limitations associated with poor settling of sludge in conventional {{activated sludge}} (CAS) processes. The technology permits bioreactor operation with considerably higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration than CAS systems, which are limited by sludge settling. The process is typically operated at MLSS in the range of 8,000–12,000mg/L, while CAS are operated in the range of 2,000–3,000mg/L. The elevated biomass concentration in the MBR process allows for very effective removal of both soluble and particulate biodegradable materials at higher loading rates. Thus increased sludge retention times, usually exceeding 15 days, ensure complete nitrification even in extremely cold weather.|$|E
25|$|By far, {{the most}} {{commonly}} used commercial process for treating acid mine drainage is lime precipitation in a high-density sludge (HDS) process. In this application, a slurry of lime is dispersed into a tank containing acid mine drainage and recycled sludge to increase water pH to about 9. At this pH, most toxic metals become insoluble and precipitate, aided by the presence of recycled sludge. Optionally, air may be introduced in this tank to oxidize iron and manganese and assist in their precipitation. The resulting slurry is directed to a sludge-settling vessel, such as a <b>clarifier.</b> In that vessel, clean water will overflow for release, whereas settled metal precipitates (sludge) will be recycled to the acid mine drainage treatment tank, with a sludge-wasting side stream. A number of variations of this process exist, as dictated by the chemistry of ARD, its volume, and other factors. Generally, the products of the HDS process also contain gypsum and unreacted lime, which enhance both its settleability and resistance to re-acidification and metal mobilization.|$|E
2500|$|Over time, {{different}} treatment configurations {{have evolved}} as denitrification {{has become more}} sophisticated. [...] An initial scheme, the Ludzack-Ettinger Process, placed an anoxic treatment zone before the aeration tank and <b>clarifier,</b> using the return activated sludge (RAS) from the <b>clarifier</b> as a nitrate source. [...] Influent wastewater (either raw or as effluent from primary clarification) serves as the electron source for the facultative bacteria to metabolize carbon, using the inorganic nitrate {{as a source of}} oxygen instead of dissolved molecular oxygen. This denitrification scheme was naturally limited to the amount of soluble nitrate present in the RAS. [...] Nitrate reduction was limited because RAS rate is limited by the performance of the <b>clarifier.</b>|$|E

50|$|One {{specific}} {{application is}} as pre-treatment stage for effluent entering membrane filters. Lamella <b>clarifiers</b> {{are considered to}} be one of the best options for pre-treatment ahead of membrane filters. Their all steel design means there is a low chance that part of the inclined plate will chip off and be carried over into membrane, especially when compared to tube settlers which are constructed of plastic. Further lamella <b>clarifiers</b> are able to maintain the required water quality to the membrane without the use of chemicals. This is a cost saving measure both in purchasing chemicals and limiting damage to the membrane, as membranes do not work well with the large particles contained in flocculants and coagulants.|$|R
