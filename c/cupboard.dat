5|$|That the gun had a {{silencer}} on {{it during}} the murders was central to the prosecution's case. With the silencer, the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned the gun on herself. According to the prosecution, paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed {{to have been made}} during a fight for the gun. That the silencer was found in the gun <b>cupboard</b> was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason to return it to the <b>cupboard</b> before killing herself. But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—has blighted the prosecution's case, even though it was accepted by a majority of the jury.|$|E

5|$|The {{financial}} {{ties and}} inheritance issues within {{the immediate and}} extended family added a layer of complexity to the case. Bamber's parents' estate included land and buildings occupied by Bamber's cousins, who were made aware, after the murders, that Bamber intended to sell them. It {{was one of those}} cousins who found the silencer in the gun <b>cupboard</b> after the murders, with the flecks of blood and paint that proved pivotal to the prosecution.|$|E

5|$|A corrupt {{political}} leader named Chedi Singh (Sonu Sood) meets Chulbul and both quickly become enemies. Makkhi asks {{his father to}} arrange his marriage with Nirmala.

In desperate need of money, Makkhi steals from Chulbul's <b>cupboard</b> and gives the stolen cash to Nirmala's father, hoping that he will permit Makkhi to marry Nirmala. Meanwhile, Chulbul meets Rajjo and proposes marriage, which she rejects, as she has {{to take care of}} her father, Haria (Mahesh Manjrekar)—a drunkard.|$|E

5|$|South of {{the church}} stands a cloister {{surrounded}} by ranges of buildings on three sides, the church forming the fourth. As is known, the cloister was {{the heart of the}} abbey, where the monks spent most of their time when not in church, engaged in study, copying books and the creation of illuminated manuscripts.

5|$|The rifle had {{normally}} {{been used}} to shoot rabbits with the silencer and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the telescopic sight {{had to be removed}} with a screwdriver, but it was usually left in place because it was time-consuming to realign it. Nevill's nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26–28 July 1985, and told the court that he had seen the rifle, in the gun <b>cupboard</b> in the ground-floor office, with the sight and silencer attached. He had taken the gun out and used it for target practice.|$|E

The register is located within a metal <b>cupboard</b> that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery. More recently, in larger sites, a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign. The headstones within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size.|$|E
