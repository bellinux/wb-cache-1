6000|$|The {{audience}} {{seemed to}} agree with him. The point went big. The voice that had said, [...] "Hear, hear" [...] said [...] "Hear, hear" [...] again, and my <b>corn</b> <b>chandler</b> hammered the floor vigorously with a large-size walking stick.|$|E
6000|$|He paused, and beamed rather freely, to {{show that}} this was comedy. I could have told the man it was no use. Not a ripple. The <b>corn</b> <b>chandler</b> leaned against me and muttered [...] "Whoddidesay?" [...] but that was all.|$|E
60|$|In fact, I and the <b>corn</b> <b>chandler,</b> who {{was looking}} a bit fagged I thought, {{as if he had}} had a hard morning chandling the corn, were {{beginning}} to doze lightly when things suddenly brisked up, bringing Gussie into the picture for the first time.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Dahlia, who {{was sitting}} with a bevy of the local nibs in the second row, sighted me as I entered and waved to me to join her, but I was too smart for that. I wedged myself in among the standees at the back, leaning up against a chap who, from the aroma, {{might have been a}} <b>corn</b> <b>chandler</b> or {{something}} on that order. The essence of strategy on these occasions is to be as near the door as possible.|$|E
50|$|When Susan died about 1664 Winstanley {{was paid}} £50 {{for the land}} in Cobham by King. Winstanley {{returned}} to London trade, whilst retaining his connections in Surrey. In about 1665 he married his second wife Elizabeth Stanley and re-entered commerce as a <b>corn</b> <b>chandler.</b> Winstanley died in 1676, aged 66, vexed by legal disputes concerning a small legacy owed {{to him in a}} will.|$|E
50|$|Towne {{was born}} in Isleworth in Middlesex, {{the son of a}} <b>corn</b> <b>chandler.</b> In 1752 he was apprenticed to a leading coach painter in London, Thomas Brookshead. In 1759 he won a design prize from the Society of Arts, and studied for a while at St Martin’s Lane Academy; {{according}} to his pupil John White Abbott many years later, around this time he also studied under the court portraitist John Shackleton.|$|E
50|$|In April 1789 the {{committee}} put {{the matter to}} a parochial vote, winning their case by 313 votes to 70. A bill was put to the House of Commons. Opponents of the proposal undertook yet another survey {{with a view to}} rebuilding on the old site. Finally a compromise was reached; the bill became an act empowering the trustees to acquire, for £875, Church Field which lay to the north-east of the existing churchyard. The existing tenants, a butcher and <b>corn</b> <b>chandler,</b> were given three months to move.|$|E
50|$|Dixon was {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} {{of seven children}} (two sons, five daughters) born to a <b>corn</b> <b>chandler</b> in Horncastle, Lincolnshire. She began working with water-colour by the mid-19th century, and completed portraits in Horncastle. She was instructed by Magdalene Dalton (née Ross), sister of portrait painter William Charles Ross. Despite this instruction, Dixon did not spend much time studying art, copying pictures, or pursuing further education.Dixon worked in Hull, on the Isle of Wight, and in London {{until the end of}} the 19th century. From 1844 to 1893, Dixon displayed 222 portraits at the Royal Academy. In 1859, Dixon received her first Royal commission from Queen Victoria, to paint a miniature of Princess Blanche d'Orléans (1857-1932) at Claremont. A number of her portraits remain in the Royal Collection. The royal favour she received from Queen Victoria allowed Dixon to earn further commissions from nobility.|$|E
