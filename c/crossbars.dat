5|$|The {{earliest}} type of tower {{used was}} a massive self-supporting delta pylon, or waist pylon, which consumed 21 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line. This type of pylon {{was used for the}} first 735kV power line from the Manic-Outardes power stations to the load centre of Montreal. There are two significant variations of the delta pylon; one has longer side <b>crossbars</b> such that all three bundles of conductors are suspended on V-shaped insulators. The other has shorter side <b>crossbars,</b> such that the two outside bundles are hung on a vertical insulator string and only the middle bundle is hung with a V-shaped insulator.|$|E
5|$|A {{field goal}} (FG), worth three points, is scored {{when the ball}} is placekicked or dropkicked through the {{uprights}} and over the <b>crossbars</b> of the defense's goalposts. After a PAT attempt or successful field goal the scoring team must kick the ball off to the other team.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, Hydro-Québec {{researchers}} engineered a {{new type}} of pylon, the V-guyed tower, which reduced materials consumption to 11.8 tonnes of steel per kilometre of power line. This type of tower also includes a variation with longer side <b>crossbars,</b> where all conductors are hung with a V-shaped insulator and one with shorter side crossbar, where only the middle bundle hangs from the insulator and the side bundles are strung on vertical insulator strings.|$|E
50|$|The {{obvious way}} to emulate a <b>crossbar</b> switch {{was to find}} some way to build it from smaller <b>crossbar</b> switches. If a <b>crossbar</b> switch could be {{emulated}} by some arrangement of smaller <b>crossbar</b> switches, then these smaller <b>crossbar</b> switches could also, in turn be emulated by even smaller <b>crossbar</b> switches. The switching fabric could become very efficient, and possibly even be created from standardized parts. This is called a Clos network.|$|R
30|$|To {{design the}} <b>crossbar</b> circuit with two binary memristor arrays, we can {{consider}} {{two types of}} <b>crossbar</b> architecture. The first architecture is the complementary <b>crossbar</b> in Fig.  1 b [11, 12], {{and the other one}} is called the twin <b>crossbar</b> [10]. In this paper, we perform a comparative study between the two <b>crossbar</b> architectures for different variation and correlation parameters using the Monte Carlo method. Based on the results of this comparative study, we can estimate which <b>crossbar</b> architecture is better and how much it is better in various conditions of statistical variation and correlation.|$|R

5|$|Sheffield teams {{created the}} first goals with solid <b>crossbars.</b> Heading, throw-ins, corner kicks and {{awarding}} free kicks for fouls were also conceived in Sheffield games. One of the most enduring rules of the Sheffield game prevented a goal from being scored directly from a free kick or throw in/kick in. This was present in every version of the Sheffield Rules and was later adopted within the FA rules. It was later refined by the International Football Association Board into the modern-day indirect free kick.|$|E
5|$|The {{colour pattern}} varies, ranging from very light-coloured {{specimens}} with small, incomplete, dark dorsal <b>crossbars</b> to entirely brown ones with faint or clear, darker brown markings, {{and on to}} melanistic individuals that are entirely dark and lack any apparent dorsal pattern. However, most {{have some kind of}} zigzag dorsal pattern down the entire length of their bodies and tails. The head usually has a distinctive dark V or X on the back. A dark streak runs from the eye to the neck and continues as a longitudinal series of spots along the flanks. Unusual for snakes, the sexes are possible to tell apart by the colour. Females are usually brownish in hue with dark-brown markings, the males are pure grey with black markings. The basal colour of males will often be slightly lighter than that of the females, making the black zigzag pattern stand out. The melanistic individuals are often females.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} new <b>crossbar</b> switch {{structure}} with adaptive bandwidth control. In a complex SoC design, the proposed <b>crossbar</b> switch efficiently incorporates various IPs with different bandwidth requirements. Simulation under various traffic scenarios {{shows that the}} throughput of the proposed <b>crossbar</b> switch {{is as high as}} that of conventional switch operating at twice the speed. The proposed <b>crossbar</b> switch shows maximum 27 % improvement in throughput and maximum 41 % improvement in latency compared to the conventional one. The proposed <b>crossbar</b> switch is implemented using verilog HDL, synthesized with 0. 18 um process library, and verified on FPGAs. The area and power overhead of the proposed <b>crossbar</b> switch is 21 % and 15 %, respectively, when compared to the conventional <b>crossbar</b> switch. I...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new time-shared twin memristor <b>crossbar</b> for pattern-recognition applications. By sharing two memristor arrays at {{different}} time, {{the number of}} memristor arrays can be reduced by half, saving the <b>crossbar</b> area by half, too. To implement the time-shared twin memristor <b>crossbar,</b> we also propose CMOS time-shared subtractor circuit, in this paper. The operation of the time-shared twin memristor <b>crossbar</b> is verified using 3 [*]×[*] 3 memristor array which is made of aluminum film and carbon fiber. Here, the <b>crossbar</b> array is programmed to store three different patterns. When we apply three different input vectors to the array, we can verify that the input vectors are well recognized by the proposed <b>crossbar.</b> Moreover, the proposed <b>crossbar</b> is tested for the recognition of complicated gray-scale images. Here, 10 images with 32 [*]×[*] 32  pixels are applied to the proposed <b>crossbar.</b> The simulation result verifies that the input images are recognized well by the proposed <b>crossbar,</b> even though the noise level of each image is varied from − 10 to + 10  dB.|$|R
30|$|For {{implementing}} the <b>crossbar</b> circuit of pattern recognition, the input image should {{be compared with}} the stored images which are already stored in the <b>crossbar.</b> By doing so, the <b>crossbar</b> circuit can calculate amounts of similarity between one input image and many stored images one by one [9, 10]. After comparing the amounts of similarity in the <b>crossbar,</b> the winner-take-all circuit chooses which one the best matches with the input image among many stored images in the <b>crossbar</b> [9, 10].|$|R

50|$|In many games, at {{each end}} of the field of play, there are two {{vertical}} posts (or uprights) supporting a horizontal <b>crossbar.</b> In some games, such as association football or hockey, the object is to pass the ball between the posts below the <b>crossbar,</b> while in others, such as those based on rugby, the ball must pass over the <b>crossbar</b> instead. In Gaelic football and hurling, in which the goalposts are similar to those used in rugby, the ball can be kicked either under the <b>crossbar</b> for a goal, or over the <b>crossbar</b> between the posts for a point. The vertical supports are usually called goal posts and the horizontal top is usually called the <b>crossbar.</b> A goal in these games normally requires that the ball or puck be sent between the posts, under the <b>crossbar</b> and completely behind the goal line.|$|R

25|$|The {{body of the}} bumpnose {{trevally}} is {{a silvery}} green-blue above, becoming more silvery-white below, with a dark blotch present on the operculum. The spinous dorsal fin and the soft dorsal fin rays are black, while the anal fin is brownish, with the filaments and lobe often blackish. The caudal fin has black trailing and leading edges, and the pelvic fin is dusky to black. Juveniles often have five to seven vertical <b>crossbars</b> on their sides.|$|E
25|$|The golden trevally's colour is {{the species}} most {{prominent}} distinguishing feature, {{and for which}} it acquired its common names. Juveniles are a bright golden yellow colour over their entire body and all fins, with 7 to 11 black vertical <b>crossbars</b> all over their body. These bars generally alternate between broad and narrow. The caudal fin lobes have dark tips {{and there is a}} prominent black edge to the operculum. As the fish grows, the body becomes more silver to silvery golden and the cross bars fade or disappear, often replaced by dark blotches. The fins remain yellow, often with greenish tinges. The dark edge of the operculum also fades with age.|$|E
25|$|The longfin trevally's colour is {{variable}} with age, although {{maintains a}} general colouration of greyish blue above, fading to a whitish silver near the belly region. Younger individuals show a more silver blue dorsally, and have six dark <b>crossbars</b> {{visible on the}} body past the pectoral fin base. There is a distinct blackish blotch on the upper margin of the operculum. The first dorsal fin is pale grey to black, while the second dorsal fin and anal fin are both hyaline to black. The pectorals are dusty hyaline, the pelvics are usually black with a white leading edge and the caudal fin is also hyaline, with a dusty trailing edge.|$|E

25|$|The Buddhist stupa, a dome shaped monument, {{was used}} in India as a {{commemorative}} monument associated with storing sacred relics. The stupa architecture was adopted in Southeast and East Asia, where it became prominent as a Buddhist monument used for enshrining sacred relics. Fortified cities with stūpas, viharas, and temples were constructed during the Maurya empire (c. 321–185 BCE). Wooden architecture was popular and rock cut architecture became solidified. Guard rails—consisting of posts, <b>crossbars,</b> and a coping—became a feature of safety surrounding a stupa. Temples—build on elliptical, circular, quadrilateral, or apsidal plans—were constructed using brick and timber. The Indian gateway arches, the torana, reached East Asia with the spread of Buddhism. Some scholars hold that torii derives from the torana gates at the Buddhist historic site of Sanchi (3rd century BCE – 11th century CE).|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{a simple}} {{electronic}} circuit consisting of an LC network and a memristor {{was used to}} model experiments on adaptive behavior of unicellular organisms. It was shown that subjected to a train of periodic pulses, the circuit learns and anticipates the next pulse similar to the behavior of slime molds Physarum polycephalum where the viscosity of channels in the cytoplasm responds to periodic environment changes. Applications of such circuits may include, e.g., pattern recognition. The DARPA SyNAPSE project funded HP Labs, {{in collaboration with the}} Boston University Neuromorphics Lab, has been developing neuromorphic architectures which may be based on memristive systems. In 2010, Versace and Chandler described the MoNETA (Modular Neural Exploring Traveling Agent) model. MoNETA is the first large-scale neural network model to implement whole-brain circuits to power a virtual and robotic agent using memristive hardware. Application of the memristor crossbar structure in the construction of an analog soft computing system was demonstrated by Merrikh-Bayat and Shouraki. In 2011 they showed how memristor <b>crossbars</b> can be combined with fuzzy logic to create an analog memristive neuro-fuzzy computing system with fuzzy input and output terminals. Learning is based on the creation of fuzzy relations inspired from Hebbian learning rule.|$|E

40|$|Memristor <b>crossbar</b> is {{prevailing}} {{as one of}} {{the most}} promising candidates to construct the neural network because of their similarity to biological synapses, favorable programmability, simple structure and high performance regarding area efficiency and power consumption. However, the performance of the memristor <b>crossbar</b> is limited by unideal programming and sensing process. In this thesis, the most preferred cell structure which is known as “one-transistor-one-memristor” is investigated. Different factors that may have impacts on programming, such as the structure, the parameters and the conductance of a <b>crossbar</b> cell are studied using both theoretical analysis and simulation. Based on previous analysis, the programming process of the memristor <b>crossbar</b> deserves a deep exploration. For programming, the primary objective is to find out the relationship between the programmability of the memristor <b>crossbar</b> and its characteristics, such as the IR-drop and the <b>crossbar</b> size.
