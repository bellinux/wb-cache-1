25|$|The first non-fatal {{incident}} was on 30 October 1961. It involved a BUA mainline Vickers Viscount 736 (registration: G-AODH operating an internal German charter flight {{under contract to}} BEA from Berlin Tempelhof Airport to Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport. While executing a missed approach during an instrument approach to Rhein-Main Airport in poor visibility, the aircraft crash-landed. It struck the ground alongside Rhein-Main's runway 25 and rolled to a stop. There aircraft was damaged beyond repair, {{but there were no}} fatalities among the 16 occupants (four crew and 12 passengers) although a flight attendant and a passenger sustained injuries. Accident investigators concluded that the crash-landing was caused by the captain flying below the <b>critical</b> <b>height</b> in inadequate surface visibility. They furthermore concluded that the assistance the captain received from his co-pilot at the critical moment was erroneous and misleading, and therefore constituted an important contributing factor.|$|E

50|$|The Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld (ATG) {{instability}}, {{also known}} as the Grinfeld instability, is an elastic instability often encountered during molecular beam epitaxy. If there is a mismatch between the lattice sizes of the growing film and the supporting crystal, elastic energy will be accumulated in the growing film. At some <b>critical</b> <b>height,</b> the free energy of the film can be lowered if the film breaks into isolated islands, where the tension can be relaxed laterally.

40|$|Turbulence {{driven by}} magnetorotational {{instability}} (MRI) crucially affects {{the evolution of}} solid bodies in protoplanetary disks. On the other hand, small dust particles stabilize MRI by capturing ionized gas particles needed for the coupling of the gas and magnetic fields. To provide an empirical basis for modeling the coevolution of dust and MRI, we perform three-dimensional, ohmic-resistive MHD simulations of a vertically stratified shearing box with an MRI-inactive "dead zone" of various sizes and with a net vertical magnetic flux of various strengths. We find that the vertical structure of turbulence is well characterized by the vertical magnetic flux and three <b>critical</b> <b>heights</b> derived from the linear analysis of MRI in a stratified disk. In particular, the turbulent structure depends on the resistivity profile only through the <b>critical</b> <b>heights</b> and is insensitive {{to the details of}} the resistivity profile. We discover scaling relations between the amplitudes of various turbulent quantities (velocity dispersion, density fluctuation, vertical diffusion coefficient, and outflow mass flux) and vertically integrated accretion stresses. We also obtain empirical formulae for the integrated accretion stresses {{as a function of the}} vertical magnetic flux and the <b>critical</b> <b>heights.</b> These empirical relations allow to predict the vertical turbulent structure of a protoplanetary disk for a given strength of the magnetic flux and a given resistivity profile.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{a model of}} thin layer turbulence that follows {{the evolution of the}} two-dimensional motions u__ 2 D (x,y) along the horizontal directions (x,y) coupled to a single Fourier mode along the vertical direction (z) of the form u_q (x, y, z) =[v_x(x,y) sin(qz), v_y(x,y) sin(qz), v_z(x,y) cos(qz) ], reducing thus the system to two coupled, two-dimensional equations. The reduced dimensionality of the model allows a thorough investigation of the transition from a forward to an inverse cascade of energy as the thickness of the layer H=π/q is varied. Starting from a thick layer and reducing its thickness it is shown that two <b>critical</b> <b>heights</b> are met (i) one for which the forward unidirectional cascade (similar to three-dimensional turbulence) transitions to a bidirectional cascade transferring energy to both small and large scales and (ii) one for which the bidirectional cascade transitions to a unidirectional inverse cascade when the layer becomes very thin (similar to two-dimensional turbulence). The two <b>critical</b> <b>heights</b> are shown to have different properties close to criticality that we are able to analyze with numerical simulations {{for a wide range of}} Reynolds numbers and aspect ratios...|$|R

50|$|The sector {{collapse}} {{was probably}} {{caused by the}} edifice oversteepening as it grew, with Ollagüe reaching a <b>critical</b> <b>height</b> before the collapse. Magma pressurization probably triggered the failure, as {{the remnants of a}} lava lake in its summit indicate that magma pressure in the edifice was high {{at the time of the}} collapse. Conversely, hydrothermal alteration - which tends to weaken the stability of a volcanic edifice - was not involved in the onset of instability. The northwest-southeast cutting fault probably additionally destabilized the edifice, allowing it to fail into a southwestern direction. A previous southwesterly tilt of the basement also assisted in focusing the failure into that direction.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe investigate, at a {{laboratory}} scale, {{the collapse of}} cylindrical shells of radius R and thickness t induced by a granular discharge. We measure the <b>critical</b> filling <b>height</b> for which the structure fails upon discharge. We observe that the silos sustain filling heights significantly above an estimation obtained by coupling standard shell-buckling and granular stress distribution theories. Two effects contribute to stabilize the structure: (i) below the <b>critical</b> filling <b>height,</b> a dynamical stabilization due to granular wall friction prevents the localized shell-buckling modes to grow irreversibly; (ii) above the <b>critical</b> filling <b>height,</b> collapse occurs before the downward sliding motion of the whole granular column sets in, such that only a partial friction mobilization is at play. However, we notice also that the <b>critical</b> filling <b>height</b> is reduced as the grain size d increases. The importance of grain size contribution {{is controlled by the}} ratio d/Rt−−√.

The aircraft, which was due to land at Stansted {{at the end of}} a cargo flight from Malta, had already carried out two missed approaches. On the third approach it collided with a tree three-quarters of a mile (1.21 km) short of the runway. This resulted in the aircraft bursting into flames.

5000|$|The defect theory {{proposes that}} the {{turbulent}} sweeps that are generated in turbulent flows [...] entrain sediment that upon deposition generates defects in a non-cohesive material. These deposits then propagate downstream via a flow separation process, thus developing bedform fields. The {{origin of the}} defects {{is thought to be}} linked to packets of hairpin vortex structures. These coherent turbulent structures give rise to entrainment corridors on the mobile bed, forming grain lineations that interact with the low-speed streaks generating an agglomeration of grains. Once a <b>critical</b> <b>height</b> of grains is reached, flow separation occurs over the new structure. Sediment will be eroded close from the reattachment point and deposited downstream creating a new defect. This new defect will thus induce formation of another defect and the process will continue, propagating downstream while the accumulations of grains quickly evolve into small bedforms.|$|E

40|$|Materials {{rotating}} above/below an {{accretion disk}} around a central object {{suffer from the}} influence of the strong radiation fields of the disk as well as the gravity of the central object. We find that there exists a <b>critical</b> floating <b>height</b> where the vertical gravity of the central object is balanced by the radiation force from the disk, and the materials are photon-floating there. The <b>critical</b> floating <b>height</b> is detemined by the disk effective luminosity Gamma_eff, which is defined by Gamma_eff = (sigma/sigma_T) (m_p/m) (L_d/L_E), where sigma and m are the material cross-section and mass, respectively, sigma_T and m_p the Thomson cross-section and the proton mass, respectively, and L_d and L_E the disk luminosity and the Eddington luminosity, respectively. For small Gamma_eff or large r (» z) the <b>critical</b> floating <b>height</b> Z_F is expressed as Z_F ～ 3 r_in_Gamma_eff, where r_in is the inner radius of the disk. The astrophysically important point is that this <b>critical</b> floating <b>height</b> is dynamically stable; hence, materials, such as gas clouds or dust or artificials, suffering from the radiation field of the disk drift toward this floating height. Such floating clouds - photon floaters - above/below the disk partially occults the disk. If the disk sky is cloudy, the observed luminosity becomes irregular. Futhermore, if a cloudy sky is present, the emitted spectrum would be remarkably modified due to reprocessing. A cloudy sky would also produce absorption/emission features. In addition, since the radiation from the disk is scattered by floating clouds at a <b>critical</b> floating <b>height,</b> the disk appears as if its thickness had become Z_F.
