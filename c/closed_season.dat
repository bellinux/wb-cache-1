5|$|Another {{issue is}} that Murray cod caught and {{released}} in winter, while developing their eggs, or in spring prior to spawning, resorb their eggs and do not spawn. This may be a minor issue compared {{to some of the}} other threats facing Murray cod, nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times. At this point in time a <b>closed</b> <b>season</b> is in place for the spring spawning period, during which anglers are not allowed to target Murray cod, even on a catch and release basis.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{has four}} stands. The Main Stand (renamed the Garrison Lane Stand from 2010 to 2012), a {{free-standing}} structure {{on the north}} side of the playing area, was completed in 1954 and has seating for fewer than 5,000 spectators. The upper tier contains the media area and an area of corporate seats as well as standard seating. The lower tier, known as the Paddocks, consists of a few rows of seats placed on the uncovered terraced area in front of the stand; the view from this area can be obstructed by the central tunnel and the dugouts. A row of executive boxes was added at the back of the Paddocks in the 1970s. The family area is divided between the eastern end of the Main Stand and the Paddock beneath. The club planned £1.3million worth of restructuring and refurbishment work on the stand, which contained hospitality areas and offices, during the 2009 <b>closed</b> <b>season,</b> and seating was replaced in 2010. The broadcasting gantry is situated in the roof of this stand.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Theo Paphitis {{announced}} that he was stepping down as chairman of the club with Jeff Burnige to replace him from May 2005. At the end of the 2004–05 season, manager Dennis Wise {{announced that}} he was leaving as he was unable to form a working relationship with the new chairman. Former Millwall striker Steve Claridge was announced as the new player-manager of Millwall. However, when Burnige then stepped down just two months after taking up the post, it was announced on 27 July that Claridge had been sacked after just 36 days, without ever taking charge of the team in a competitive match. Former Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Colin Lee replaced him but lasted only five months in charge of the club. On 21 December, with the club bottom of the Championship, he became the club's Director of Football and was replaced as manager by 32-year-old player Dave Tuttle, on a short-term contract {{until the end of the}} 2005–06 season. Tuttle had no prior experience in football management. In February 2006, Lee left the club altogether. Millwall experienced a difficult season, having had four managers in 2005. Their 13 goals scored at home was the second worst in Football League history. Their relegation to League One was confirmed on 17 April 2006 with a 2–0 loss against Southampton. In the <b>closed</b> <b>season</b> Nigel Spackman was appointed as the new manager, but he lasted only four months after a string of bad results. In September 2006, Theo Paphitis (chairman from 1997 to 2005) ended his nine-year association with the club after a year-long spell as a non-executive director. On 19 March 2007, Willie Donachie signed a two-year contract following some progress which had seen the club climb to 11th place in the league. Before Donachie took charge, Millwall had taken only six points from their first ten games. In the 2007–08 season Millwall sat bottom of the table at the beginning of October. Donachie was sacked on 8 October, with Richard Shaw and Colin West becoming caretaker managers.|$|E

25|$|The first bison {{preservation}} {{efforts in}} Canada included the Unorganized Territories Game Preservation Act of 1894, {{through which the}} government legislated a <b>closed</b> <b>season</b> on the bison. This act was passed after naturalists conducted rough and largely inaccurate visual surveys of the bison population, concluding that the animal was in decline. From this assumption naturalists were {{able to create a}} more active federal wildlife administration in the Northwest Territories. The Wood Buffalo National Park was created in 1922 in response to Northern Canada's wildlife crisis.|$|E
500|$|The pitch {{measures}} [...] It was relaid {{three times}} in 2007. The first attempt, made because the surface had deteriorated to a dangerous condition, was unsuccessful because of freak rainfall {{which resulted in the}} postponement of the next match– the first time such an event had happened in senior English football. The work had to be repeated, and then done for a third time in the <b>closed</b> <b>season.</b> The postponement of an FA Cup-tie in January 2009 highlighted the lack of under-soil heating, which was installed in June. In 2017 the surface was converted to use the SISGrass hybrid grass reinforced turf system.|$|E
500|$|During the 2010 <b>closed</b> <b>season</b> the {{football}} pitch and hospitality areas were renovated, with a £1 million investment {{being made in}} the playing surface {{so that it is}} better able to tolerate concerts and other events without damage. In October 2010, Manchester City renegotiated the stadium lease, obtaining the naming rights to the stadium in return for agreeing to now pay the City Council an annual fixed sum of [...] £3million where previously it had only paid half of the ticket sales revenue from match attendances exceeding 35,000. This new agreement occurred as part of a standard five-year review of the original lease and it amounts to an approximate £1million annual increase in council revenues from the stadium.|$|E

2500|$|Grinnell {{was aware}} of the {{possible}} extirpation of the wolverine in California by 1937, if not earlier, for he wrote a summary of all documentation, sightings, captures and stories on wolverines in Fur-bearing Mammals of California, with the last known sighting listed at 1924. Grinnell estimated [...] " [...] at the present time (1933) there are at most no more than 15 pairs of wolverine left in the State."

2500|$|P.charlestoni is {{protected}} {{by a number of}} laws in Cape Verde. A limited number of licences are granted (only five in 2006), and a minimum landing size of [...] is applied. A ban on landing egg-bearing females was repealed, and the <b>closed</b> <b>season</b> extended from three to six months (July to November). An estimate of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of P.charlestoni using Fox's surplus production model suggested that the species is being overexploited; it found the MSY to be around 40t, which could be caught using only 60% of the effort expended on the fishery in 1999. Because of the likely overexploitation, and the species' limited range, it is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
2500|$|Through the Unorganized Territories Game Preservation Act of 1894, {{the federal}} {{government}} enforced a <b>closed</b> <b>season</b> on the bison. The plains bison were near extinction in Canada and with these efforts the government hoped to preserve them from the Aboriginal hunters. However, preservation efforts were not only for recreational purposes. After the Second World War, the bison were used for commercial purposes as well. As the numbers of bison increased, {{the federal government}} issued licenses to regulate the number of bison and bring in revenue. Aboriginal people were excluded from national parks, not {{for the sake of}} preserving wilderness, but in the [...] "interests of game conservation, sport hunting, tourism, and Indian assimilation." [...] This represented a shift in federal wildlife policy goals from preservation of wilderness to the commercialization and commodification of the national parks. Aboriginals were excluded from Banff National Park in Alberta to serve the goals of conservationists and sportsmen. Furthermore, Aboriginal hunting practices conflicted with the goals of the Department of Indian Affairs to civilize and assimilate Aboriginal people. Beginning in the 1880s, Aboriginals were encouraged to abandon hunting in favour of an agricultural lifestyle. Thus, the goal of the federal government was not to restore and protect wilderness, but to create an environment with an abundance of wildlife attractions for sports hunting and tourism, and to assimilate Aboriginal people into Euro-Canadian society.|$|E

2500|$|Formerly the Bramall Lane stand, and {{sponsored}} by 188 Bet, {{this is the}} oldest existing stand at Bramall Lane, this two-tiered structure was opened in 1966 behind the goal at the Bramall Lane end, opposite the Kop. From the 2006–07 Premier League season, the bottom tier is occupied by away fans whilst the upper tier, which links into the south-west corner infill stand, is given to home fans (although part of the upper tier may be offered to away fans for cup fixtures if demand is sufficient). This {{is in contrast to}} previous seasons, when away fans had the upper tier (and hence the marginally better view) much to the annoyance of home fans. During the 2005–06 season, the outside of the Bramall Lane Stand was reclad in red-and-white, with the stand sponsors and the club crest {{on the outside of the}} stand, while the wooden seats of the upper tier were replaced with newer plastic seats with the words [...] "BLADES" [...] written into them. When the corner infill stand was built during the <b>closed</b> <b>season,</b> the roof over the Bramall Lane Stand was extended toward the pitch to provide better cover for the lower tier and to remove the supporting pillars from the upper tier. There are approximately 2,700 seats in the upper tier, and 2,990 in the lower, giving a total capacity of 5,680. This stand has for many years housed a basic LCD scoreboard and clock between the upper and lower tiers, however at the start of the 2006–07 season both were replaced by a modern colour video scoreboard. In 2012, the club announced that the stand would be named after Olympic Champion and United fan Jessica Ennis (now known as Jessica Ennis-Hill).|$|E

60|$|And {{there were}} more young men at the house than formerly, and they helped in {{disposing}} of the cocktails. Frederick {{would have liked to}} account in that manner for their presence, but he knew better. His brother and his brother's daughter did what he and Mary had failed to do. They were the magnets. Youth and joy and laughter drew to them. The house was lively with young life. Ever, day and night, the motor cars honked up and down the gravelled drives. There were picnics and expeditions in the summer weather, moonlight sails on the bay, starts before dawn or home-comings at midnight, and often, of nights, the many bedrooms were filled as they had never been before. Tom must cover all his boyhood ramblings, catch trout again on Bull Creek, shoot quail over Walcott's Prairie, get a deer on Round Mountain. That deer was a cause of pain and shame to Frederick. What if it was <b>closed</b> <b>season?</b> Tom had triumphantly brought home the buck and gleefully called it sidehill-salmon when it was served and eaten at Frederick's own table.|$|E

6000|$|Having {{satisfied}} {{his curiosity}} Sparrer started {{back to the}} dam and followed it to the woods on the farther shore. He had intended to go straight across the pond to the second dam, but his discovery of the traps had aroused his sense of caution and he decided {{that it would be}} better to keep to the woods. On the broad white expanse of the pond he would be altogether too conspicuous should it happen that curious eyes were watching. As he skirted the shore of the pond through the brush his thoughts were so busy with his discovery that for the time being he quite forgot to keep an eye out for rabbit signs. The illegality of this attempt to catch beaver in a <b>closed</b> <b>season</b> did not impress him at first. He had had nothing to do with game and game laws. They were entirely outside his range of experience. In fact, he failed utterly to grasp the purpose back of the laws and like a great many others he regarded them as a restriction of individual liberty, and a violation as of no very great moment. They were to him very much as the [...] "keep off the grass" [...] signs in the city park.|$|E
60|$|The {{boys are}} bright, lively fellows of to-day, {{with a natural}} taste for a life in the open, and a fondness for a gun and a rod. In the present volume they {{organize}} their little club, and after {{a good deal of}} talk obtain permission to go a number of miles from home and establish a camp {{on the edge of a}} lake. From this spot they are driven away by one who is their enemy, and then they go elsewhere. They have fun and adventures in plenty, around the camp and while out after both big and little game, and they help to bring to justice two men who are hiding from the officers of the law. To-day hunting in our country is not what it was some years ago. Many of the best hunting localities have become settled, and it is becoming harder and harder to catch a sight of a deer, or a moose, or a bear, or, in fact, any wild animal of size. In the far West the buffalo has been practically wiped out, and in the East the deer and moose would also be gone were it not for the protection of the law, which makes it illegal to shoot down such game during the <b>closed</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
60|$|We gave up this bull-fight at once, but we {{were the}} more {{resolved}} to see a bull-fight because we still owed it to the Spanish people to come away before we had {{time to look at}} it, and we said we would certainly go at Cordova where we should spend the next Sabbath. At Cordova we learned that it was the <b>closed</b> <b>season</b> for bull-fighting, but vague hopes of usefulness to the Spanish public were held out to us at Seville, the very metropolis of bull-fighting, where the bulls came bellowing up from their native fields athirst for the blood of the profession and the aficionados, who outnumber there the amateurs of the whole rest of Spain. But at Seville we were told {{that there would be no}} more bull-feasts, as the Spaniards much more preferably call the bullfights, till April, and now we were only in October. We said, Never mind; we would go to a bull-feast in Granada; but at Granada the season was even more hopelessly closed. In Ronda itself, which is the heart, as Seville is the home of the bull-feast, we could only see the inside of the empty arena; and at Algeciras the outside alone offered itself to our vision. By this time the sense of duty was so strong upon us that if there had been a bull-feast we would have shared in it and stayed through till the last espada dropped dead, gored through, at the knees of the last bull transfixed by his unerring sword; and the other toreros, the banderilleros with their darts and the picadors with their disemboweled horses, lay scattered over the blood-stained arena. Such is the force of a high resolve in strangers bent upon a lesson of civilization to a barbarous people when disappointed of their purpose. But we learned too late that only in Madrid is there any bull-feasting in the winter. In the provincial cities the bulls are dispirited by the cold; but in the capital, for the honor of the nation, they somehow pull themselves together and do their poor best to kill and be killed. Yet in the capital where the zeal of the bulls, and I suppose, of the bull-fighters, is such, it is said that there is a subtle decay in the fashionable, if not popular, esteem of the only sport which remembers in the modern world the gladiatorial shows of imperial Rome. It is said, but I do not know whether it is true, that the young English queen who has gladly renounced her nation and religion for the people who seem so to love her, cannot endure the bloody sights of the bull-feast; and when it comes to the horses dragging their entrails across the ring, or the espada despatching the bull, or the bull tossing a landerillero in the air she puts up her fan. It is said also that the young Spanish king, who has shown himself such a merciful-minded youth, and seems so eager to make the best of the bad business of being a king at all, sympathizes with her, and shows an obviously abated interest at these supreme moments.|$|E
