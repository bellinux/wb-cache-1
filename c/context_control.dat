However, if an instrument instance {{does not exist in}} that state, then the process precondition evaluation fails and the control skips the process.

Graphically, the condition instrument link extending from a specified instrument state to the process it enables. The syntax of the condition state-specified instrument link OPL sentence is: Process occurs if Instrument is qualifying-state, otherwise Process is skipped.|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{optimizing}} building energy performance requires complex measurement, estimation and analysis. To address {{the complexity of}} designing for energy efficiency, models need to describe a building's different subsystems: The structure, processes, occupants, control equipment, etc. For example, a Building Information Model (BIM) describes a building's structure, while Business Process Models (BPM) can formalize processes going on in a building, and a <b>Context</b> <b>Control</b> Model (CCM) describes heterogeneous devices {{in relation to a}} building's context. To express the interdependencies between these subsystems an Enterprise Energy Performance Management Model (E-EPMM) is needed, integrating and extending the subsystems' models. In this paper we focus on the physical subsystem (the building and devices) presenting a <b>Context</b> <b>Control</b> Model for devices and appliances {{as an integral part of}} the E-EPMM. Further, we describe a middleware approach for instantiating and using th e CCM and its application in a multi-agent based energy performance simulation framework...|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{designed}} to study latent inhibition typically {{use as a}} control condition a group of ani-mals preexposed to the training context, {{but not to the}} conditioned stimulus (i. e., the <b>context</b> <b>control).</b> Experiments using the rat autoshaping preparation demonstrate that nonreinforced preexposure to the context facilitates subsequent conditioning to a discrete stimulus, particularly with large reinforcers (Experiment 1) and dramatically enhances performance under the unfavorable conditions posed by massed training (Experiment 2). Furthermore, it is nonreinforced preexposure to the training context, and not to a nontraining context, that enhances autoshaping performance (Experiment 3). The facilita-tory effect of nonreinforced preexposure to the training context questions the exclusive use of the <b>context</b> <b>control</b> in latent inhibition experiments and suggests that findings based on such comparisons need to be reevaluated. Pavlovian conditioning resulting from the pairing of a conditioned stimu-lus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US) can be interfered with by nonrein-forced preexposure to the CS, a phenomenon called latent inhibition or the CS-preexposure effect. The CS-preexposure effect has been reported in numerous conditioning preparations (Lubow, 1989). In a typical demonstration, Tranberg an...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiency}} {{with which}} the brain resolves conflict in information processing is determined by contextual factors that modulate internal control states, such as the recent (local) and longer-term (global) occurrence of conflict. Local ???<b>control</b> <b>context???</b> effects {{can be observed in}} trial-by-trial adjustments to conflict (congruency sequence effects: less interference following incongruent trials), whereas global <b>control</b> <b>context</b> effects are reflected in adjustments to the frequency of conflict encountered over longer sequences of trials (???proportion congruent effects???: less interference when incongruent trials are frequent). Previous neuroimaging and lesion studies suggest that the modulation of conflict-control processes by local <b>control</b> <b>context</b> relies on partly dissociable neural circuits for cognitive (non-emotional) vs. emotional conflicts. By contrast, emotional and non-emotional conflict-control processes have not been contrasted with respect to their modulation by global <b>control</b> <b>context.</b> We addressed this aim in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study that varied the proportion of congruent trials in emotional vs. non-emotional conflict tasks across blocks. We observed domain-general conflict-related signals in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and pre-supplementary motor area and, more importantly, task-domain also interacted with global <b>control</b> <b>context</b> effects: specifically, the dorsal striatum and anterior insula tracked control-modulated conflict effects exclusively in the emotional domain. These results suggest that, similar to the neural mechanisms of local <b>control</b> <b>context</b> effects, there are both overlapping as well as distinct neural substrates involved in the modulation of emotional and non-emotional conflict-control by global <b>control</b> <b>context...</b>|$|R

As predicted, participants selected the low-conflict category more frequently, indicating that participants avoid contexts with high-conflict likelihood. Furthermore, we predicted a correlation between this preference for the low-conflict category and the control implementation associated with the categories (i. e., context-specific proportion congruency effect, CSPC effect).
