5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person can engage in instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or <b>coping</b> <b>strategy</b> must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E

40|$|Background of the Study: Ability to {{cope with}} {{pressure}} and anxiety to increase performance {{is an integral part}} of sports. There is considerable evidence in support of the relationship between anxiety and <b>coping</b> <b>strategies</b> and performance of athletes. Coping strategies can be divided into cognitive, somatic and negative. Cognitive <b>coping</b> <b>strategies</b> are imagery, thought stopping, focus in the present, think practice, worst-case scenario, keep active, positive self-talk, simulation and goal-setting. Whereas somatic <b>coping</b> <b>strategies,</b> which include in the present research are progressive relaxation, meditation, breath control, autogenic training and biofeedback. Athletes also found using negative <b>coping</b> <b>strategies</b> like drugs, alcohol and smoking. Aims: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usage of cognitive, somatic and negative <b>coping</b> <b>strategies</b> according to gender. Besides that, the present study also finds the correlations between <b>coping</b> <b>strategies</b> and sport performance. Study Design: Comparative descriptive study design was used to compare Cognitive, Somatic and Negative Coping Strategies among athletes. Place and Duration of Study: Sample: The sample consisted of 98 athletes, male (N= 53) and female (N= 45). The data was collected during sport between universities. Methodology: The instrument used for the study comprised of a 26 -item of Cognitive, Somatic and Negative Coping Strategies. In additional, the study also used Sport Performance Questionnaire. Results: Result showed that male athletes used more cognitive, somatic and negative <b>coping</b> <b>strategies.</b> The result also showed that those athletes, who highly used cognitive, somatic and negative <b>coping</b> <b>strategies,</b> their performance increase. Conclusion: Therefore, sport psychologist and coach should encourage female athletes to use more <b>coping</b> <b>strategies,</b> since it increases sport performances. Even though, negative <b>coping</b> <b>strategies</b> also enhance performance, but sport psychologist, sport counselor and coach, should discourage athletes use it, since it can cause negative effect to health and consider as unethical behavior...|$|R
40|$|Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease with younger-onset, characterised by behavioural and/or language decline known as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and primary progressive aphasia (PPA) respectively. Those caregiving for persons with FTD and PPA arguably appraise their caregiving role and adopt <b>coping</b> <b>strategies</b> unique to the syndrome. The aim of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} appraisals, <b>coping</b> <b>strategies</b> and psychological wellbeing of FTD/PPA caregivers. A systematic review (Study 1) found no caregiver or care-recipient characteristics were reliably predictive of dementia caregivers’ adoption of solution-focused, emotional support/acceptance-based or dysfunctional <b>coping</b> <b>strategies.</b> Study 2 found the effect of care-recipients’ care needs on FTD caregivers’ wellbeing depended on caregiver appraisals of strain. Use of dysfunctional <b>coping</b> <b>strategies</b> and fewer financial resources contributed to high levels of caregiver strain, which in turn predicted reduced QoL. Caregivers’ use of dysfunctional coping as a response to their strain increased levels of depression, while problem-focused <b>coping</b> <b>strategies</b> increased their QoL. Study 3 found PPA severity was not predictive of caregiver satisfaction or psychological wellbeing. Caregivers’ appraisal of satisfaction was not related to <b>coping</b> <b>strategies,</b> caregiver depression and positive affect, nor did satisfaction act as a mediator of PPA severity and psychological wellbeing. Rather, problem-focused coping uniquely predicted reduced caregiver depression. Younger PPA caregivers were at risk of adopting more dysfunctional <b>coping</b> <b>strategies.</b> This thesis highlights that the <b>coping</b> <b>strategies</b> adopted by FTD and PPA caregivers influence their caregiving appraisals and psychological wellbeing. As <b>coping</b> <b>strategies</b> are amenable to change and were central to the psychological wellbeing of both FTD and PPA caregivers, <b>coping</b> <b>strategies</b> ought to be a focus of intervention in this population.
