5|$|The {{piezoelectric}} {{properties of}} <b>crystalline</b> <b>quartz</b> were discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880. The first quartz crystal oscillator {{was built by}} Walter G. Cady in 1921, and in 1927 the first quartz clock was built by Warren Marrison and J. W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Canada. The following decades saw the development of quartz clocks as precision time measurement devices in laboratory settings—the bulky and delicate counting electronics, built with vacuum tubes, limited their practical use elsewhere. In 1932, a quartz clock able to measure small weekly variations in the rotation rate of the Earth was developed. The National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the time standard of the United States on quartz clocks from late 1929 until the 1960s, when it changed to atomic clocks. In 1969, Seiko produced the world's first quartz wristwatch, the Astron. Their inherent accuracy and low cost of production {{has resulted in the}} subsequent proliferation of quartz clocks and watches.|$|E
25|$|Milk quartz or milky quartz is {{the most}} common variety of <b>crystalline</b> <b>quartz.</b> The white color is caused by minute fluid {{inclusions}} of gas, liquid, or both, trapped during crystal formation, making it of little value for optical and quality gemstone applications.|$|E
25|$|One {{good example}} of this is the quartz form of silicon dioxide, or SiO2. In the vast {{majority}} of silicates, the Si atom shows tetrahedral coordination by 4 oxygens. All but one of the crystalline forms involve tetrahedral {SiO4} units linked together by shared vertices in different arrangements. In different minerals the tetrahedra show different degrees of networking and polymerization. For example, they occur singly, joined together in pairs, in larger finite clusters including rings, in chains, double chains, sheets, and three-dimensional frameworks. The minerals are classified into groups based on these structures. In each of its 7 thermodynamically stable crystalline forms or polymorphs of <b>crystalline</b> <b>quartz,</b> only 2 out of 4 of each the edges of the {SiO4} tetrahedra are shared with others, yielding the net chemical formula for silica: SiO2.|$|E

This wall may be {{a continuation of the}} Akankon formation; both are rich in a highly <b>crystalline</b> <b>quartz</b> of livid blue, apparently the best colour throughout the Gold Region. The surface-ground, of yellowish marl with quartz-pebbles, is evidently auriferous, and below it lies a harder red earth rusty with iron. From the southern boundary of the Inyoko concession, and the village of that name, runs a strong outcrop of a kindly white quartz, which, when occurring in conjunction with the blue, usually denotes that both are richer than when a single colour is found. Such at least is Cameron's experience.|$|E

In general, the composition of the residue reflects that of the non-aluminium components, with the exception of part of the silicon component: <b>crystalline</b> silica (<b>quartz)</b> will not react but some of the silica present, often termed, reactive silica, will react under the extraction conditions and form sodium aluminium silicate.|$|R

50|$|Silica (the {{chemical}} compound SiO2) {{has a number}} of distinct <b>crystalline</b> forms: <b>quartz,</b> tridymite, cistobalite, and others (including the high pressure polymorphs Stishovite and Coesite). Nearly all of them involve tetrahedral SiO4 units linked together by shared vertices in different arrangements. Si-O bond lengths vary between the different crystal forms. For example, in α-quartz the bond length is 161 pm, whereas in α-tridymite it ranges from 154-171 pm. The Si-O-Si bond angle also varies from 140° in α-tridymite to 144° in α-quartz to 180° in β-tridymite.|$|R
50|$|Shocked quartz {{is a form}} of quartz {{that has}} a {{microscopic}} structure that is different from normal quartz.

Respirable crystalline silica was first listed in the Sixth Annual Report on Carcinogens in 1991 as reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals; however, the listing was revised to known to be a human carcinogen in the Ninth Report on Carcinogens in 2000. Hazardous human exposure to respirable <b>crystalline</b> silica, primarily <b>quartz</b> dusts, occurs mainly in industrial and occupational settings (discussed in “Exposure”).

5000|$|Silicon dioxide (silica) {{is a high}} melting solid with {{a number}} of crystal forms; the most {{familiar}} of which is the mineral quartz. In <b>crystalline</b> <b>quartz</b> each silicon atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms that bridge to other silicon atoms to form a three dimensional lattice (see below for the vitreous or glass form of pure silica).

50|$|Chrysoprase is cryptocrystalline, {{which means}} that it is {{composed}} of crystals so fine that they cannot be seen as distinct particles under normal magnification. This sets it apart from rock crystal, amethyst, citrine, and the other varieties of <b>crystalline</b> <b>quartz.</b> Other members of the cryptocrystalline silica family include agate, carnelian, and onyx. Unlike many non-transparent silica minerals, it {{is the color of}} chrysoprase, rather than any pattern of markings, that makes it desirable. The word chrysoprase comes from the Greek χρυσός chrysos meaning 'gold' and πράσινον prasinon, meaning 'green'.|$|E

Detailed mineralogical and petrological {{descriptions of the}} pegmatites are given, and a more generalised petrological description of the Adelaide System rocks enclosing the pegmatites. The tabular pegmatites are classified into three groups based on textural and mineralogical differences. Group 1 has a finely <b>crystalline</b> margin containing <b>quartz,</b> albite and tourmaline, and a coarsely crystalline core consisting of quartz, microcline and muscovite. Pegmatites of group 2 have a coarsely <b>crystalline</b> margin containing <b>quartz,</b> microcline, albite, muscovite, tourmaline and beryl, and a coarse core of quartz, microcline and muscovite. Group 3 pegmatites have no zoning and consist of quartz, feldspars and muscovite of variable crystal size. The irregular pegmatites show properties of all 3 groups.

50|$|Due to the {{volcanic}} {{nature of the}} Watchungs, zeolites, including prehnite, analcime, and stilbite, which form from a reaction of mafic rocks in alkaline environments, can be found along exposed ridge lines. Agate, primarily {{in the form of}} chalcedony, and <b>crystalline</b> <b>quartz</b> (sometimes in the form of amethyst), are prominent in the ancient lava flows of the Watchungs and are typically seen as embedded nodules along exposed fronts.

50|$|Variations of {{the story}} include that Dionysus had been insulted by a mortal and swore to slay the next mortal who crossed his path, {{creating}} fierce tigers {{to carry out his}} wrath. The mortal {{turned out to be a}} beautiful young woman, Amethystos, who was on her way to pay tribute to Artemis. Her life was spared by Artemis, who transformed the maiden into a statue of pure <b>crystalline</b> <b>quartz</b> to protect her from the brutal claws. Dionysus wept tears of wine in remorse for his action at the sight of the beautiful statue. The god's tears then stained the quartz purple.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{material}} for oscillator crystals is quartz. At {{the beginning of}} the technology, natural quartz crystals were used but now synthetic <b>crystalline</b> <b>quartz</b> grown by hydrothermal synthesis is predominant due to higher purity, lower cost and more convenient handling. One of the few remaining uses of natural crystals is for pressure transducers in deep wells. During World War II and for some time afterwards, natural quartz was considered a strategic material by the USA. Large crystals were imported from Brazil. Raw [...] "lascas", the source material quartz for hydrothermal synthesis, are imported to USA or mined locally by Coleman Quartz. The average value of as-grown synthetic quartz in 1994 was 60 USD/kg.|$|E
50|$|Some {{substances}} {{cause cancer}} primarily through their physical, rather than chemical, effects on cells.

Other substances in this category, including both naturally occurring and synthetic asbestos-like fibers such as wollastonite, attapulgite, glass wool, and rock wool, are believed to have similar effects. Non-fibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic cobalt and nickel, and <b>crystalline</b> silica (<b>quartz,</b> cristobalite, and tridymite). Usually, physical carcinogens must get inside the body (such as through inhaling tiny pieces) and require years of exposure to develop cancer.|$|R

50|$|Note: Light {{scattering}} in {{an ideal}} defect-free crystalline (non-metallic) solid which provides no scattering centers for incoming lightwaves will be due primarily to any effects of anharmonicity within the ordered lattice. Lightwave transmission will be highly directional due to the typical anisotropy of crystalline substances, which includes their symmetry group and Bravais lattice.

50|$|In the {{formation}} of an ordinary agate, it is probable that waters containing silica in solution—derived, perhaps, from the decomposition of some of the silicates in the lava itself—percolated through the rock and deposited a siliceous gel in the interior of the vesicles. Variations in the character of the solution or in the conditions of deposition may cause a corresponding variation in the successive layers, so that bands of chalcedony often alternate with layers of <b>crystalline</b> <b>quartz.</b> Several vapour-vesicles may unite while the rock is still viscous, and thus form a large cavity which may become the home of an agate of exceptional size; thus a Brazilian geode lined with amethyst and weighing 35 tons was exhibited at the Düsseldorf Exhibition of 1902. Perhaps the most comprehensive review of agate chemistry is a recent text by Moxon cited below.|$|E

The government hopes to resume mining in the southwest for <b>crystalline</b> <b>quartz</b> and ornamental marble. It has been estimated that 5,000 cubic meters of marble could be extracted annually for a period of twenty years.
