5000|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th {{century and}} into the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, much of what is now the Allegheny National Forest and surrounding areas were deforested, in part {{to make way for the}} oil boom that followed Edwin Drake's discovery of oil near Titusville on August 27, 1859, but also for wood <b>chemicals.</b> [...] <b>Bark</b> was in especially high demand for local tanneries that produced prodigious amounts of leather. This deforestation significantly degraded the watershed of the upper Allegheny in general, leading to floods downstream (particularly in Pittsburgh), and eventually to the declaration of the national forest in 1923, but in the case of the Clarion River, run-off from tanneries compounded the problem, as did acid mine drainage. [...] The Clarion was an important part of the timber industry, allowing timber to be transported downstream to the Allegheny, then the Ohio, and ultimately the Mississippi.

40|$|International audienceThe {{chemical}} mechanism {{displayed in}} the sorption of heavy metal cations on barks was discussed through a modelling study of adsorption {{in relation to the}} nature of the ligand borne by the chemical components of the bark sorbent. The adsorption isotherms of five heavy metal cations (Cr 3 +, Cu 2 +, Ni 2 +, Pb 2 +, Zn 2 +) on five species of barks (Sweet chestnut, Oak, Douglas fir, Norway spruce, Scots pine species) were studied. The experimental data fitted well the Langmuir model, which allowed the expression of the mathematical parameters (qmax, maximum binding capacity; b, affinity). The qmax values increased conversely to the b values. The correlation of these mathematical values (qmax and b) with the analysis of the <b>chemical</b> composition of <b>barks</b> led us to note that Cu 2 + interacts preferentially with phenolic groups present in lignins and tannins and, opposite in, Pb 2 + with the carboxylic acid groups in polysaccharides. These observations were explained (i) quantitatively by the amount of different types of sites and (ii) qualitatively, by the physicochemical characteristics of cations, the nature and the tridimensional structure of adsorption sites. Finally, the results allowed to define the nature of the chemical interaction (monodentate or multidentate complex) between each specified <b>chemical</b> component of <b>barks</b> and each kind of heavy metal cations...|$|R

30|$|Mature bark {{basically}} {{consists of}} two types of bark tissues, rhytidome and secondary phloem, which are {{also referred to as}} the outer and inner bark, respectively [20]. The secondary phloem is living tissue, which is differentiated from the vascular cambium [21]. It biosynthesizes a large number of primary and secondary metabolites from assimilation products of photosynthesis and also transports and stores these metabolites [22]. In contrast, the rhytidome is dead tissue, which originally develops from the secondary phloem [21]. It physically protects the tree body [2]. Conifers, especially Pinaceae trees, biosynthesize and store many constitutive terpenoids in the living secondary phloem [10, 23]. However, {{little is known about the}} quantitative composition and distribution of terpenoids in the rhytidome of conifers.

Many studies investigating the chemical composition of cat's claw {{have focused on the}} pentacyclic (POA) and tetracyclic oxindole alkaloids (TOA), quinovic acid glycosides (QAG), and polyphenols (PPH). Nevertheless, it is still uncertain how environmental factors affect chemical groups. The aim of this work was to better understand the influence of environmental factors (geographic origin, altitude, and season) on cat's claw <b>chemical</b> composition. Stem <b>bark,</b> branches and leaf samples were extracted and analyzed by HPLC-PDA. The data obtained were explored by multivariate analysis (HCA and PCA).

The gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) results showed the presence of fifty-four compounds in barks EO. The major components were: viridiflorol (14. 6 %), α-eudesmol (8. 65 %), trans-caryophyllene (6. 72 %), elemol (6. 63 %), β-eudesmol (6. 21 %). The obtained results showed that C. azel is a very rich plant in secondary metabolites. High contents in polyphenols, flavonoids and tannins were observed in both extracts of all studied organs. Significant differences were found between both extracts of the four organs. Thus, polyphenols and tannins were more abundant in leaves infusion extract, while, flavonoids showed a high level in barks extract. The antioxidant activity data demonstrated that all extracts showed strong antioxidant and radical scavenging activities. The MeOH extracts presented potential for antibacterial and antifungal activities against all tested microorganisms.

40|$|Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) is {{a highly}} {{productive}} crop that is cultivated worldwide for its fibre content which {{may be used to}} produce various commodities. The kenaf crop was commercially cultivated in South Africa in the 1950 ’s, but production was discontinued from the 1960 ’s up to the mid 2000 ’s. Production commenced again and kenaf emreged as a “new” fibre crop with the first kenaf processing factory in the country going into production in 2006 in KwaZulu-Natal. Due to the importance of kenaf in manufacturing of various commodities, there was a need to investigate the agronomic practices thereof to ensure sustainable yield. Therefore a two year study (2008 / 09 and 2009 / 10 summers) was conducted in Pretoria to investigate the influence of nitrogen, plant population, row spacing and water treatments on kenaf growth, yield, chemical quality and microscopic analysis of the fibre. In total, four field trials were conducted at the Hatfield Experimental Farm of the University of Pretoria. In 2008 / 09 a trial was conducted to investigate effects of plant population (200, 000; 300, 000 and 400, 000 plants ha- 1), nitrogen level (0, 50, 100 and 150 kg ha- 1) and row spacing (0. 17, 0. 34 and 0. 50 m) under rainfed conditions. Sampling for growth parameters were done at 85, 113 and 126 days after planting (DAP). The biomass and <b>chemical</b> analysis of <b>bark</b> fibre were conducted only at or after the final harvest, at 126 DAP. In general, no clear effect of different treatment was observed on either parameter studied. During 2009 / 10 three experiments were conducted. The first two had the same nitrogen levels as in the previous season, but were grown either under rainfed or irrigated conditions. The nitrogen was applied as two dressings of 0 and 50 kg ha- 1 at planting and 0, 50 and 100 kg ha- 1 at thinning (35 DAP). The third experiment investigated combinations of plant population (main plots) and row spacing (sub plots) under rainfed conditions. Due to increasing stem yield with increasing plant population during 2008 / 09, the lowest population of 200, 000 plants ha- 1 was left out and 500, 000 and 600, 000 plants ha- 1 were added. The same three row spacings as in 2008 / 09 were used. Nitrogen was applied at 150 kg ha- 1, with 50 kg ha- 1 at planting and 100 kg ha- 1 at thinning. Growth and biomass parameters, water use efficiency (WUE) (nitrogen trial only) were subsequently measured up {{to the end of the}} growth cycle. The <b>chemical</b> characteristics of <b>bark</b> fibre and nutrient removal (nitrogen trial only), nutrient use efficiency as well as the nitrogen contents of leaves and stems were determined only once at final harvest. The number of fibre rings and fibre bundles were assessed only once during the growth cycle. Growth and biomass parameters, WUE and both nutrient removal and nutrient use efficiency generally tended to increase with increase in nitrogen level under both rainfed and irrigated conditions. On the other hand, increasing plant population tended to result in a decrease in all growth parameters, while it increased biomass yield per hectare. Finally, the effect of row spacing was inconsistent for the same parameter from one sampling to another one, and from one parameter to another. The <b>chemical</b> characteristics of <b>bark</b> fibre showed inconsistent responses to all agronomic practices. The number of fibre rings and fibre bundles increased with increasing nitrogen level, decreased as plant population increased, but did not show clear trends with regard to row spacing. In general the plants grown under irrigated conditions performed better than those grown under rainfed conditions. The results of this study revealed that under the environmental conditions of Pretoria, nitrogen levels above 100 kg ha- 1 applied in two dressings should result in best plant performance, but most benefit could be obtained under irrigated conditions. A plant population of 500, 000 plants ha- 1 or higher and row spacing wider than 0. 34 m proved to be most suitable for both growth and biomass parameters.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of using treated bark to remove oily compounds from water. Bark was first biologically or chemically treated and saturated with transition metal ions (TMI) to avoid the release of soluble organic compounds from the bark in the treated effluents. Several experimental parameters affecting the oil removal efficiency (RE) were studied (initial oil concentration, temperature, time, etc.). Saturated bark was characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and bark wetting index was determined. Results of the retention of lipids suggested that their removal could exceed 95 % of initial oil concentration. The uptake of lipid by treated bark varied from 0. 2 to 2. 0 g of organic oil/g of dry sorbent. No significant chemical modifications of saturated bark were observed in infrared spectroscopy after the sorption of oleic acid on bark treated with transition metal ions. The structure of adsorbed tridimentional layer of oleic acid molecules seemed to take place through the double bond. The hydrocarbon RE exceeded 95 % using oil–water mixture with a hydrocarbon/bark ratio of one. The sorption reaction of hydrocarbons and lipids was quasi-instantaneous and seemed to be influenced by the temperature. This indicated that the retention mechanism was related to the capillary action. Results of FTIR spectroscopy suggested that no <b>chemical</b> bonds between <b>barks</b> and oily compounds were established...|$|R

There is an inverse relationship between the activity of xylophages and the abun-dance of epiphytes on Ipomoea murucoides. Xylophagy may modify the branch chemical constitution, which also affects the liberation of allelochemicals with defense and allelo-pathic properties. We evaluated the <b>bark</b> <b>chemical</b> content {{and the effect of}} extracts from branches subjected to treatments of exclusion, mechanical damage and the presence/ absence of epiphytes, on the seed germination of the epiphyte Tillandsia recurvata. Princi-pal component analysis showed that branches without any treatment separate from branches subjected to treatments; damaged and excluded branches had similar chemical content but we found no evidence to relate intentional damage with allelopathy; however 1 -hexadecanol, a defense volatile compound correlated positively with principal component (PC) 1. The chemical constitution of branches subject to exclusion plus damage or plus epi-phytes was similar among them. PC 2 indicated that palmitic acid (allelopathic compound) and squalene, a triterpene that attracts herbivore enemies, correlated positively with the inhibition of seed germination of T. recurvata. Inhibition of seed germination of T. recurvata was mainly correlated with the increment of palmitic acid and this compound reached higher concentrations in excluded branches treatments.

40|$|As climates change, thermal limits may {{no longer}} {{constrain}} some native herbivores within their historical ranges. The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, is a tree-killing bark beetle native to western North America that is currently expanding its range. Continued eastward expansion through the newly invaded and novel jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) trees of the Canadian boreal forest could result in exposure of several species of novel potential host pines common in northeastern North America to this oligophagous herbivore. Due to the tightly co-evolved relationship between mountain pine beetle and western pine hosts, in which the insect utilizes the defensive chemistry of the host to stimulate mass attacks, we hypothesized that lack of co-evolutionary association would affect the host attraction and acceptance behaviors of this insect among novel hosts, particularly those with little known historical association with an aggressive stem-infesting insect. We studied how beetle behavior differed among the various stages of colonization on newly cut logs of four novel potential pine host species; jack, red (P. resinosa Ait.), eastern white (P. strobus L.) and Scots (P. sylvestris L.) pines, {{as well as two}} historical hosts, ponderosa (P. ponderosa Dougl. ex. Laws. var. scopulorum Engelm.) and lodgepole (P. contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelm.) pines. Overall, we found that beetle colonization behaviors at each stage in the colonization process differ between pine hosts, likely due to differing <b>chemical</b> and physical <b>bark</b> traits. Pines without co-evolved constitutive defenses against mountain pine beetle exhibited reduced amounts of defensive monoterpenoid chemicals; however, such patterns also reduced beetle attraction and colonization.

Germination decreased with increasing coal rubble at 14 to 28 and at 35 days after sowing (DAS). A mix of between 0 to 50 % coal rubble with pine bark seemed ideal for germination. Aeration porosity, total porosity, and bulk density were negatively correlated to germination (14 to 28 DAS) while water holding porosity was positively correlated. Overall, the best germination was for 0 to 50 % coal rubble with subsequent bulky density of 0. 46 to 0. 83, total porosity 71 to 63 %, aeration porosity 21 to 35 % and water holding porosity 49 to 31 % respectively. However, the measured total porosity and water holding porosity of the standard substrate (50 %S 0 %CR 50 %PB) used normally by farmers were below the expected range, while the aeration porosity was on the low end. This makes this mix prone to aeration problems. The pH of the float water decreased with increase in time from sowing and proportion of coal in the mix while EC was not affected...|$|R
40|$|The beech bark disease complex {{has long}} been an {{extremely}} important exotic pest issue as it has spread throughout eastern North America since its introduction in 1890. This insect-fungal disease complex is continuing its expansion and reaching new areas such as the state of Michigan. As it does so, it has serious implications for the health of both individual trees and beech–containing ecosystems as whole. Numerous tree characteristics affect abundance of beech scale on individual trees, including tree age, diameter, area and texture of <b>bark,</b> <b>bark</b> <b>chemical</b> composition, other bark-dwelling organisms, tree genetics, side of tree bole examined, and crown health variables. Beech scale colonization is generally greater in favorable microsites. These microsites include such characteristics as large areas of rough bark, higher levels of bark nitrogen, favorable associations with bark-dwelling organisms, more shade, and low temperature fluctuations. The development of beech bark disease through its three stages of progression once beech scale is on trees in an area is affected by a number of factors such as tree age, size, vigor, and stress levels from other factors. Spread of beech bark disease through ecosystems is likely most strongly controlled by the spatial patterns of beech stands and beech trees within stands, although other agents such as wind and animals can play important roles as well. Research to date in Michigan supports the importance of contiguous forest stands in increasing the rate of beech bark disease spread. Beech bark disease has a wide array of effects on tree health, including notably greater levels of damage, poorer tree crown conditions, and reduced radial wood growth. Negative effects can occur even when the amount of beech scale present on the tree is relatively small. Further research directions are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Nutrient {{cycles and}} budgets have been {{calculated}} for various ecosystems, but {{the impact of}} floral and bark litter decomposition on nutrient cycling has been little investigated. In this study, the characteristics and decomposition of floral and bark litter produced by Nothofagus fusca in the Lewis Pass Reserve, New Zealand, was investigated, using both field and laboratory studies. Nothofagus fusca floral litter production in 1999 was 734 ± 76 kg ha⁻¹. Floral production in 2000 {{was estimated to be}} approximately 1 % of this mass, the considerable difference being due to mast flowering in 1999. The decay rate constant, k, for floral litter in the field was 0. 94 ± 0. 01, and mass loss after one year was estimated to be 61 %. The input of nitrogen to the litter layer in Nothofagus fusca floral litter was 12 ± 1 kg ha⁻¹, and it was estimated that 65 % of this nitrogen was released from the floral litter in the one year. Phosphorous input to the litter layer through Nothofagus fusca floral litter in 1999 was 0. 8 ± 0. 1 kg ha⁻¹, of which 69 % was released in one year. It was estimated that in 1999 nitrogen and phosphorous inputs to the litter layer through Nothofagus fusca floral litter were 117 % and 73 % respectively of that through foliar litter. Four types of Nothofagus fusca bark were identified and further differences between bark types were confirmed by <b>chemical</b> analysis. Inner <b>bark</b> contained less nitrogen than outer bark, and was slower to decompose in microcosms, contradicting the findings of other research. Annual nitrogen and phosphorous inputs through the production of all types of Nothofagus fusca bark litter was estimated to be 1. 0 kg ha⁻¹ and 0. 2 kg ha⁻¹ respectively, although confidence in these values was low. Significant proportions of the nitrogen and phosphorous content in bark were water soluble. Field and laboratory experiments indicated net nitrogen immobilisation occurred in all bark litter types after one year in the field, while net release of phosphorous occurred after one year...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the inventories of trees debarked by the brown bear. Sample plots {{were established in}} mixed beech-fir forests in the mountainous part of western Croatia (an area in which such type of damage is relatively frequent). The method of damaging trees {{is similar to that}} incurred by the black bear in North America and Japan. Consequently, the cause of tree damage cannot be attributed to bears marking their territory. Bears damage trees by peeling the bark off the stem. The stem and the inner part (phloem) of the bark show teeth marks. The bark from the damaged trees is scattered around the trees. The brown bear almost exclusively damaged silver fir trees of larger breast diameters growing in uneven-aged stands (the diameter classes of damaged trees range from 22. 5 to 77. 5 cm, with the damage degree culminating at 42. 5 cm). Distribution {{of the total number of}} trees, as well as the number of fir trees in the sample plots showed very high correlation with the theoretical distribution (Liocourt curve) typical of a beech-fir stand (R 2 = 0. 9629; p< 0. 0001; R 2 = 0. 93284; p< 0. 0001, respectively); however, in terms of breast diameter distribution, trees damaged by the brown bear show the typical Gaussian distribution (c 2 = 4. 93076; p = 0. 5572). The bear selected thicker fir trees in the sample plot (Kruskal-Wallis test c 2 = 139. 5987; p = 0, 001); in other words, trees with breast diameters of 57. 5 cm have the highest preference index (proneness to damage). The analysis of fir <b>bark</b> <b>chemical</b> composition (Weende analysis) showed that the quantity of raw ash (minerals), proteins, NET, calcium and phosphorus in the fir bark was higher in the locality in which damage occurred more frequently. There are several theories dealing with this topic, of which the most plausible include space over-capacity, accessibility of animal food, increased lair density and stand structure. For this reason, the topic should be studied in more detail...|$|R
