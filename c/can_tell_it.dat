This model was also originally Lusitania, and, like the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic's model, it was converted into Mauretania after Lusitania was lost. When inspecting the model, one <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> was Lusitania {{by examining the}} different boom crutches and bridge front, {{which is on the}} boat deck level.|$|E
500|$|Faiumu {{and other}} band members say their biggest {{influence}} is {{their home country}} of New Zealand, and their peers in Wellington's [...] "small-but-solid" [...] music scene—Wellington's population was less than 180,000 in 2007. They feel their music [...] "belong here in New Zealand, you <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> came from this country." [...] Fat Freddy's Drop's music has been categorised as Aotearoa roots music—meaning contemporary music inspired by Māori and Pacific Islander culture, {{even though they are}} a mixed-race group. Faiumu is a first-generation Samoan-New Zealander, Tamaira, Gordon and Kerr are native Māori, and the remaining members are descended from European immigrants.|$|E

5000|$|In 2004 Sunday {{broadcast}} a documentary of Tamaki {{and of the}} Destiny Church. The Rev Dr Philip Culbertson of the University of Auckland said: [...] "As far as I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it's</b> a cult".|$|R
500|$|Swift lists Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, and Carly Simon as {{her career}} role models: [...] "They've taken chances, but they've {{also been the}} same artist for their entire careers". McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel [...] "as if I've been let into his heart and his mind ... Any {{musician}} could only dream of a legacy like that". She admires Springsteen for being [...] "so musically relevant after such {{a long period of}} time". She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older: [...] "It's not about fame for her, it's about music". [...] " [...] shines in songwriting... He's just {{one of those people who}} has been in this business for years but you <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> hasn't chewed him up and spat him out", Swift says. She admires Simon's [...] "songwriting and honesty ... She's known as an emotional person but a strong person".|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times thought the [...] "premise {{was a little}} thinly {{stretched}} over the hour" [...] and believed {{it would have been}} overshadowed by stronger episodes in season one, but was glad to have another hour of Fringe regardless. SFScope contributor Sarah Stegall disliked that the network failed to issue a [...] "disclaimer" [...] about the episode's production date, stating [...] "...maybe the producers assume that all their audiences are brand new to the franchise. Or perhaps, unhappily, it is a sign that Fox has given up on this show, and no longer cares whether its lingering audience is confused." [...] She concluded, [...] "As a standalone episode, this one was of middling interest, and I can see why Fox would have dropped it from the Season One lineup. Fans looking eagerly for more 'mythology' episodes, where the links between the Fringe team, Massive Dynamics, Nina Sharpe, William Bell and, for all I know, the Illuminati are explored, may be disappointed." [...] Jane Boursaw of AOL TV was also critical of Fox for giving no warning about the episode and thought it should actually have been titled 'Walter vs. The Priest.'" [...] She continued, [...] "The whole episode was an interesting intersect between science and faith, not to mention the whole 'being possessed by a dead person because your brain waves crossed during life and death' thing. You <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> was vintage Fringe -- if indeed it was -- because the storylines are more complex than that these days, what with the alternate universe and Leonard Nimoy and all." [...] Various critics noted guest actress Alice Kremelberg's performance, particularly when she had to give the impression she was possessed by a male ghost; most reviews were negative, though Boursaw praised it, giving Kremelberg [...] "high fives".|$|E
2500|$|Owners {{complained that}} the {{aircraft}} was not well designed. The president of the International Experimental Helicopter Association, the Mini-500 aircraft type club, [...] Bill Phillips, who completed a kit, but did not fly it stated: [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> is junk {{just by looking at}} it" [...] and described Revolution Helicopter Corporation president Dennis Fetters as [...] "one of the biggest cons that’s ever hit the kit industry".|$|E

One 1982 {{television}} advertisement for the drink featured dwarf actor David Rappaport wearing star-shaped sunglasses at a disco, the advert finishing with the slogan [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it's</b> Tizer when {{your eyes are}} shut".

5000|$|Jeff Mattas of Shacknews has {{commented on}} the early parts of the game by saying [...] "I've only played a short bit of it so far, myself, but from what I <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> <b>it's</b> well written and funny, and seems to do an adept job at {{capturing}} the irreverent style and humor of its six official predecessors." ...|$|R
2500|$|Staines {{has been}} criticised for his {{approach}} to blogging. He often criticises the mainstream media, claiming that they are {{too close to the}} political establishment and that they also keep internal secrets about political scandals from the public.

Robinson responded via his own blog, accusing Staines of having a political agenda to damage the government.|$|E
