40|$|Cor triatriatum sinistra (CTS) {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} <b>cardiac</b> anomaly. The <b>orifice</b> diameter on {{the membrane}} dividing left atria and pulmonary artery pressure are important determinants in the clinical course. Patients usually display symptoms mimicing mitral valve stenosis during young adult. We diagnosed CTS as a structural heart disease in a 17 -year old young woman with syncopal attack. We presented this case to point out CTS, which is a rare cause of syncope etiology among structural heart diseases...|$|R
40|$|Aims Pulsed Doppler {{measurement}} of left atrial appendage (LAA) emptying velocity, {{a marker of}} left atrium contractile function, {{has been shown to}} predict success of cardioversion, thrombo-embolic risk, and maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion and pulmonary vein isolation. However, in the published literature, emptying velocity measurement location is not uniform, and no standard currently exists. We assessed the hypothesis that emptying velocity when acquired near the LAA orifice differs from that at the LAA apex. Methods and results The study group comprised 44 patients (32 in sinus rhythm and 12 in atrial fibrillation) who were able to complete a non-emergent transoesophageal echocardiography. Pulsed Doppler recordings were obtained with the sample volume first positioned 1 cm from the LAA orifice, and then positioned within 1 cm of the LAA apex. At each location, we calculated the average of the peak end-diastolic LAA emptying velocity from five consecutive <b>cardiac</b> cycles. LAA <b>orifice</b> emptying velocity was higher than the apex emptying velocity in all patients. The median velocity at the orifice was 72 cm/s, which was 45 % higher than the median velocity at the apex (43 cm/s, P, 0. 001). Lower LAA emptying velocity at the orifice was associated with a larger discrepancy between orifice and apex velocities...|$|R
5000|$|Esophageal cardiac glands- mucous glands {{located near}} the <b>cardiac</b> <b>orifice</b> (esophago-gastric junction) in the lamina propria mucosae. They secrete neutral mucin that protects the {{esophagus}} from acidic gastric juices. They are simple tubular or branched tubular glands.|$|E
50|$|The {{surface of}} the mucous {{membrane}} is covered by a single layer of columnar epithelium. This epithelium commences very abruptly at the <b>cardiac</b> <b>orifice,</b> {{where there is a}} sudden transition from the stratified epithelium of the esophagus. The epithelial lining of the gland ducts is of the same character and is continuous with the general epithelial lining of the stomach. An important iodine concentration by sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) is present in mucinous cells of surface epithelium and gastric pits of the fundus and pyloric part of the stomach.|$|E
40|$|Gastric {{teratoma}} (GT) is a seldom seen congenital abnormality. GT always {{occurs in}} children. The greater curvature and posterior {{wall of the}} stomach {{are the most common}} sites involving GT. We diagnosed a case of GT located on the inferior wall of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>orifice</b> in a 20 -year-old man. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of GT located {{on the wall of the}} <b>cardiac</b> <b>orifice</b> in an adult in the English literature. We report this unusual case as an addition to this rare disease usually found in children. Computed tomography combined with endoscopic ultrasonography can be selected to diagnose GT...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{determine}} the optical properties and their differences for normal human stomach mucosa/submucosa tissue in the <b>cardiac</b> <b>orifice</b> in vitro at 635, 730, 808, 890 and 980 nm wavelengths of laser. Methods The measurements were performed using a CCD detector, and the optical properties were assessed from the measurements using the spatially resolved reflectance, and nonlinear fitting of diffusion equation. Results The results of measurement showed that the absorption coefficients, the reduced scattering coefficients, the optical penetration depths, the diffusion coefficients, the diffuse reflectance and the shifts of diffuse reflectance of tissue samples at five different wavelengths vary with a change of wavelength. The maximum absorption coefficient for tissue samples is 0. 265 mm - 1 at 980 nm, and the minimum absorption coefficient is 0. 0332 mm - 1 at 730 nm, and the maximum difference in the absorption coefficients is 698 % between 730 and 980 nm, and the minimum difference is 1. 61 % between 635 and 808 nm. The maximum reduced scattering coefficient for tissue samples is 1. 19 mm - 1 at 635 nm, and the minimum reduced scattering coefficient is 0. 521 mm - 1 at 980 nm, and the maximum difference in the reduced scattering coefficients is 128 % between 635 and 980 nm, and the minimum difference is 1. 15 % between 890 and 980 nm. The maximum optical penetration depth for tissue samples is 3. 57 mm at 808 nm, and the minimum optical penetration depth is 1. 43 mm at 980 nm. The maximum diffusion constant for tissue samples is 0. 608 mm at 890 nm, and the minimum diffusion constant is 0. 278 mm at 635 nm. The maximum diffuse reflectance is 3. 57 mm - 1 at 808 nm, and the minimum diffuse reflectance is 1. 43 mm - 1 at 980 nm. The maximum shift Δx of diffuse reflectance is 1. 11 mm - 1 at 890 nm, and the minimum shift Δx of diffuse reflectance is 0. 507 mm - 1 at 635 nm. Conclusion The absorption coefficients, the reduced scattering coefficients, the optical penetration depths, the diffusion coefficients, the diffuse reflectance and the shifts of diffuse reflectance of tissue samples at 635, 730, 808, 890 and 980 nm wavelengths vary with a change of wavelength. There were significant differences in the optical properties for tissue samples at five different wavelengths (P < 0. 01). </p...|$|E
