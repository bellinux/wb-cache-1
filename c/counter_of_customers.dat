It takes the market for sex {{as a case study}} and <b>counters</b> the neglect <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> within the study of service work by analysing <b>customer</b> service reviews <b>of</b> paid-for sex published on a UK website, Punternet. It argues that male customers, familiar with the norms of consumer culture, assess the erotic, aesthetic and emotional labours performed by female workers to make judgements of service quality which suggests that the feminised ‘good worker’ is defined as professional when they disguise the market transaction. ...|$|R

Currently, there are many industry competitors operate in this Market. It has found an aggressive competition in terms of product attributes. Product attributes usually comprise features, functions, benefits, and uses. It creates a meaningful difference in a brand's performance. Product attributes determines the bargaining power <b>of</b> <b>customers,</b> {{as a result of}} that the switching behaviors <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> has been frequently happening along with strong customer bargaining power. This study was focused on the bargaining power <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> related with the product attributes of Tooth paste on switching behavior <b>of</b> <b>customers.</b> 300 respondents were selected under stratified probability sampling method. Data were collected through structured questionnaire along with Likert scale. Five sets of independent variables were identified as per the literature reviews namely quality, product variety (differentiation), price, branding and packaging factors. An inferential statistical analysis was used to analyze the collected data. The "Regression Model" was used to test six hypotheses, these were developed to test the switching behavior impacted by bargaining power <b>of</b> <b>customers.</b> Variables <b>of</b> product attributes impacted on the bargaining power <b>of</b> <b>customers.</b> Data analysis revealed that the bargaining power <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> have more impact on switching behavior <b>of</b> <b>customers.</b> Quality and product variety factors had more impact on bargaining power <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> than price, branding and packaging factors.

40|$|The article {{considers}} {{development of}} a fiber-optic system to monitor the <b>counters</b> <b>of</b> particles. Presently, optical <b>counters</b> <b>of</b> particles, which are often arranged at considerable distance from each other, are used to study the saltation phenomenon. For monitoring the counters, can be used electric communication lines. However, it complicates and raises the price of system Therefore, we offered a fiber-optic system and the <b>counter</b> <b>of</b> particles, free from these shortcomings. The difference between the offered <b>counter</b> <b>of</b> particles and the known {{one is that the}} input of radiation to the counter and the output of radiation scattering on particles are made by the optical fibers, and direct radiation is entered the optical fiber rather than is delayed by a light trap and can be used for lighting the other counters thereby allowing to use their connection in series. The work involved a choice of the quartz multimode optical fiber for communication, defining the optical fiber and lenses parameters <b>of</b> the <b>counter</b> <b>of</b> particles, and a selection of the radiation source and the photo-detector. Using the theory of light diffraction on a particle, a measuring range of the particle sizes has been determined. The system speed has been estimated, and {{it has been shown that}} a range of communication can reach 200 km. It should be noted that modulation noise <b>of</b> <b>counters</b> <b>of</b> particles connected in series have the impact on the useful signal. To assess the extent of this influence we have developed a calculation procedure to illustrate that with ten counters connected in series this influence on the signal-to-noise ratio will be insignificant. Thus, it has been shown that the offered fiber-optic system can be used for monitoring the <b>counters</b> <b>of</b> particles across the desertified territories.  </p...|$|R

Increasingly, studies are focusing on consumers as <b>customers</b> <b>of</b> enterprises.

On the basis of literature on the subject and practical approaches, this study presents several ways to measure the value <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> for the company. Strategies for the management <b>of</b> value for <b>customers,</b> with the aim of providing higher value <b>of</b> <b>customers</b> for the company, are a critical part of the operation of enterprises.
