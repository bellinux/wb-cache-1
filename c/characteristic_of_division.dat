Though there are currently projects in place to improve access to these vital documents, the arrangement of programmes has so far escaped in-depth study. Therefore this study considered the theoretical framework underpinning the arrangement of concert programmes. Theories in archival arrangement, bibliographic classification and ephemera organisations were the base of this study; particularly, the system <b>of</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>division</b> and scattering (bibliographic classification) and provenance (archival arrangement). Literature on concert programmes was also discussed from both a musicology and collection management perspective. The various classification theories were then used as a framework to analyse three case study institutions which hold programmes: an archive, a library and a research centre. Two models of the arrangement of concert programmes were suggested followed by a list of ten decisions that concert programme managers may consider {{in the process of}} managing concert programmes. The study revealed that the arrangement of concert programmes could be viewed as a bridge between archival, bibliographic and ephemera arrangement theories. The arrangement could be theoretically justified as the bibliographic system <b>of</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>division,</b> where some divisions were archival (provenance) and ephemeral (arrangement by form). An alternative way of considering this arrangement was proposed: a triumvirate of event, object and manuscript. The complex relationships between elements of the triumvirate were considered, as well as how the various characteristics which constitute a concert programme fit into the model. Results suggested that aspects of programmes relating to the event rather than the physical object {{were more likely to be}} used for arrangement purposes...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{scandals and}} {{violations}} {{that occur in}} today's intercollegiate athletic programs are hardly a new phenomenon. One {{of the main reasons}} for the formation of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 1906 was to assist institutions in gaining control over their athletic programs. Although steps have been taken to improve intercollegiate athletics, serious problems still exist. As a result of the increasing complexity of intercollegiate athletics and the number of violations that continue to occur, many institutions have created compliance positions. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the responsibilities and the educational, professional, and personal <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Division</b> I compliance coordinators. SIGNIFICANCE: The findings obtained from the study will be a comprehensive resource on the topic and could be used by individuals preparing for positions in compliance as well as by institutions considering the creation of such positions. METHODS: All Division I compliance coordinators as listed in the 1991 NCAA Directory of Compliance Coordinators were purposely targeted to participate in this study. The instrument used in the study was a questionnaire. The questionnaire was specifically designed to collect information regarding the responsibilities and the educational, professional, and personal <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Division</b> I compliance coordinators. Each compliance coordinator was mailed a cover letter of explanation, a questionnaire, and a pre-addressed, stamped envelope. The cover letter explained the purpose of the study, who was selected to participate in the study, and how the results would be used. A two-week deadline was specified for the return of the completed questionnaire. To avoid confusion in recording returns and for later follow-up purposes, each questionnaire was coded with a number in the upper right hand corner. Individuals who had not responded by the two-week deadline were sent a second cover letter of explanation, a questionnaire, and a pre-addressed, stamped envelope. Once again, a two-week deadline was stipulated. Computations were made in order to analyze the individual responses of the returned questionnaires. The statistics were combined in order to provide an overall analysis <b>of</b> <b>Division</b> I compliance coordinators. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. A. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{aperture}} {{pattern of}} pollen grains {{is a character}} defined as the number, shape, and position of apertures. Although this character is highly variable in angiosperms, two states are particularly widespread. Pollen grains with one polar aperture occur frequently in basal angiosperms and monocots while tricolpate pollen is a synapomorphy of the eudicots. Many morphological characters {{are the result of}} a compromise between selective forces (acting on morphology) and developmental constraints (limiting the range of possible morphologies). To investigate what are the respective roles of development and selection in the determination of aperture pattern in angiosperms, we have chosen to study the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>division</b> during male meiosis, since {{it has been shown that}} aperture pattern is determined during microsporogenesis. The present study focuses on Asparagales. From a selection of species belonging to the major families of Asparagales, we described the type of cytokinesis, the way callose is deposited, the shape of the tetrad, as well as the shape and position of apertures within the tetrad. We show that although pollen morphology is quite uniform in Asparagales (most species produce monosulcate pollen), the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>division</b> during male meiosis vary among families. A highly conserved developmental sequence is observed in higher Asparagales whereas lower Asparagales, and particularly Iridaceae, display different ways <b>of</b> achieving cell <b>division...</b>|$|R

The limited focus on scholarship student-athletes has overlooked the majority of NCAA student-athletes, those participating in collegiate athletic programs without athletic scholarships. Therefore, this study contributes to a gap in the literature about non-scholarship student-athletes. The following dissertation examined the academic performance, time-to-degree, and demographic and profile <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Division</b> IA scholarship and non-scholarship student-athletes. The theoretical framework for this study was work motivation viewing athletic scholarships as extrinsic rewards. The researcher applied descriptive discriminant analysis utilizing secondary data to compare scholarship and non-scholarship student-athletes across several variables. Results of this study showed that non-scholarship student-athletes were described by the variables of sport (Women 2 ̆ 7 s Outdoor Track and Field), race (Asian, White), sport type (Individual), and sex (Female). Non-Scholarship student-athletes had higher grade point averages than scholarship student-athletes. The scholarship student-athlete group was described by race (Black), sport (Football, Men 2 ̆ 7 s Basketball, Women 2 ̆ 7 s Basketball), sport type (Team), and sex (Male). Scholarship student-athletes graduated in fewer semesters than non-scholarship student-athletes did. This finding suggests that academic performance and time-to-degree variables are inversely related based on scholarship status. The results of the study showed significant differences between the scholarship and non-scholarship student-athlete groups based on demographic, academic performance, and time-to-degree variables...|$|R

A {{descriptive}} and {{comparative study of}} physical and performance <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> NCAA <b>Division</b> II and Division III softball players. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe and compare the physical and performance <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Division</b> II and III softball players. This research also aimed to collect physical and performance measurements to begin the establishment of normative data on college softball players Methods: Participants included two teams of female varsity National College Athletic Association Division (NCAA) II (N= 19) and III (N= 16) student-athletes. Athletes were evaluated prior to the softball season on select physical and performance characteristics; including height, weight, body composition, lean body mass, right and left grip strength, batted-ball velocity, throwing velocity, running speed, and vertical power. An independent t-test was performed to determine statistically significant differences between the Division II and Division III softball players. Results: Results of the physical and performance measures are illustrated in Table 1. Table 1. Physical and Performance measures of DII and DIII softball players. Measurements (mean) 	DII	DIII Height(in) 	 61. 64 	 64. 2 Weight(lbs) 	 146. 95 	 148. 94 Body composition	 24. 26 	 24. 66 Lean body mass	 115. 08 	 111. 47 Grip strength R(kg) 	 31. 42 	 32. 66 Grip strength L(kg) 	 28. 73 	 28. 66 Batted-ball velocity(mph) 	 61. 46 *	 56. 44 Throwing velocity(mph) 	 52. 24 	 53. 44 Running speed(sec) 	 6. 25 	 6. 07 Vertical Power(in) 	 14. 88 	 14. 45 *p 3 ̆c 0. 05 The results of the study indicated that the only variable found to be statistically significant was batted-ball velocity (t (33) = - 2. 706, p = 0. 011). Results showed no other statistically significant differences in physical and performance characteristics. Discussion: The results of this study suggest that the physical and performance <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> DII and DIII softball players are similar, with the only significant difference being observed in the batted-ball velocity. This difference suggests that DII athletes are able to hit the ball harder than DIII athletes. Examination of Table 1 indicates that, although not significant, lean body mass is greater in DII than in DIII. A higher lean body mass suggests more muscle which in turn may translate into greater batted-ball velocity. The research perhaps suggests that differences in performance of DII and DIII players may be attributed to some additional factors other than the physical and performance characteristics measured in this study. Further research is needed in identifying the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> various levels of collegiate softball players. Subsequently, the establishment of normative data pertaining to collegiate softball will help potential collegiate softball players and coaches understand what physical and performance characteristics are needed to compete at different collegiate levels...|$|R
