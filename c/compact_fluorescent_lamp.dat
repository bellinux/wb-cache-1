40|$|The Australian {{government}} {{has introduced a}} policy to replace all inefficient incandescent lamps with energy saving <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> by 2010. However, unlike incandescence <b>lamps,</b> <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> do not draw sinusoidal currents at almost unity power factor. Therefore, implementation of this policy may introduce serious power quality problems for the power supply authorities. This paper investigates the impact of current harmonics generated {{by a number of}} different types of <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps,</b> commonly available in Australia, {{on the quality of the}} conventional supply. Experimental results are presented to show a comparison of the actual energy consumption, power factor, costs, Lumen levels and current harmonics of <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> and incandescent lamps. These results show that the power quality and the amount of light output from <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> do not depend on the cost of <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps.</b> Simulation results are presented using the experimental data to determine the impact of large influx of <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> on the third harmonic component present neutral current.

25|$|A <b>compact</b> <b>{{fluorescent}}</b> <b>lamp</b> is {{a fluorescent}} lamp designed to replace an incandescent lightbulb. Some CFL's fit into light fixtures formerly used for incandescent lamps {{and they are}} designed to produce the same amount of visible light found in incandescent light. CFLs generally use 70% less energy and have a longer rated life. In 1941, George Inman devised the first practical fluorescent lamp while working for General Electric. The key patent for this light source, U.S. patent #2,259,040 was filed by Inman on April 22, 1936 and issued to him on October 14, 1941. In 1976, Edward E. Hammer invented the first helical or spiraled <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp,</b> but due to the difficulty of the manufacturing process for coating the interior of the spiral glass tube, General Electric did not manufacture or sell the device. Other companies began manufacturing and selling the device in 1995.|$|E
25|$|A <b>compact</b> <b>{{fluorescent}}</b> <b>lamp</b> (CFL), {{also called}} compact fluorescent light, energy-saving light, and compact fluorescent tube, is a fluorescent lamp designed to replace an incandescent light bulb; some types fit into light fixtures designed for incandescent bulbs. The lamps use a tube which is curved or folded {{to fit into}} the space of an incandescent bulb, and a compact electronic ballast in the base of the lamp.|$|E
25|$|The common {{fluorescent}} lamp relies on fluorescence. Inside the glass tube is a partial vacuum {{and a small}} amount of mercury. An electric discharge in the tube causes the mercury atoms to emit mostly ultraviolet light. The tube is lined with a coating of a fluorescent material, called the phosphor, which absorbs the ultraviolet and re-emits visible light. Fluorescent lighting is more energy-efficient than incandescent lighting elements. However, the uneven spectrum of traditional {{fluorescent lamp}}s may cause certain colors to appear different than when illuminated by incandescent light or daylight. The mercury vapor emission spectrum is dominated by a short-wave UV line at 254nm (which provides most of the energy to the phosphors), accompanied by visible light emission at 436nm (blue), 546nm (green) and 579nm (yellow-orange). These three lines can be observed superimposed on the white continuum using a hand spectroscope, for light emitted by the usual white fluorescent tubes. These same visible lines, accompanied by the emission lines of trivalent europium and trivalent terbium, and further accompanied by the emission continuum of divalent europium in the blue region, comprise the more discontinuous light emission of the modern trichromatic phosphor systems used in many <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> and traditional lamps where better color rendition is a goal.|$|E

The results of some measurements on <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> (CFL) and on self-ballasted <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> (SBL) of various wattages are presented.

The strategic importance of the mass use of electronic <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps,</b> as well as serious power quality implications it can cause to the network, are explained in detail. Possible solutions of this problem are also presented...|$|R

2500|$|According to the Northwest <b>Compact</b> <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>Lamp</b> Recycling Project, because {{household}} {{users in}} the U.S. Northwest {{have the option of}} disposing of these products in the same way they dispose of other solid waste, in Oregon [...] "a large majority of household CFLs are going to municipal solid waste". They also note the EPA's estimates for the percentage of fluorescent lamps' total mercury released when they are disposed of in the following ways: municipal waste landfill 3.2%, recycling 3%, municipal waste incineration 17.55% and hazardous waste disposal 0.2%.|$|E
2500|$|White LEDs have {{advanced}} to the stage where they are a good substitute for the <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp.</b> The latest types are exhibiting superior efficacies (mostly because no power is wasted on powering heated cathodes) and a choice of 'colour temperature'. The most common type consists of a blue light emitting diode with a coating of cerium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet which produces yellow light when the blue light from the diode lands on it. The combination of the yellow and blue light produces white light. [...] LED bulbs have a long life of around 25,000 hours. Like CFLs, the light output degrades as the bulb ages though somewhat more slowly.|$|E
2500|$|This {{may occur}} in compact {{fluorescent}} lamps with integral electrical ballasts or in linear lamps. Ballast electronics failure is a somewhat random process that follows the standard failure profile for any electronic device. There is an initial small peak of early failures, followed by a drop and steady increase over lamp life. Life of electronics is heavily dependent on operating temperature—it typically halves for each 10nbsp&°C temperature rise. The quoted average {{life of a lamp}} is usually at [...] ambient (this may vary by country). The average life of the electronics at this temperature is normally greater than this, so at this temperature, not many lamps will fail due to failure of the electronics. In some fittings, the ambient temperature could be well above this, in which case failure of the electronics may become the predominant failure mechanism. Similarly, running a <b>compact</b> <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> base-up will result in hotter electronics, which can cause shorter average life (particularly with higher power rated ones). Electronic ballasts should be designed to shut down the tube when the emission mix runs out as described above. In the case of integral electronic ballasts, since they never have to work again, this is sometimes done by having them deliberately burn out some component to permanently cease operation.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>compact</b> <b>{{fluorescent}}</b> <b>lamp</b> (CFL) uses {{a fluorescent}} lamp tube which is curved or folded {{to fit into}} the space of an incandescent bulb and contains a compact electronic ballast in the base of the lamp. Compared to general-service incandescent lamps giving the same amount of visible light, CFLs use one-fifth to one-third the electric power, and may last eight to fifteen times longer. [...] Newer phosphor formulations have improved the perceived color, with [...] "soft white" [...] CFLs judged subjectively similar to standard incandescent lamps. Objections more specifically relating to compact fluorescent light bulbs include the different quality of light produced by phosphor-based lamps compared to incandescent lamps and that compact fluorescent light bulbs contain small amounts of mercury, a potent neurotoxin, which is especially dangerous to children and pregnant women, and made more serious by the confined area mercury would be dispersed {{in the event of a}} breakage indoors. Environmental concerns about mercury contamination from CFLs have been raised, but CFLs can be shown to result in less mercury in the environment compared to traditional incandescent bulbs due to the significant reductions in power plant emissions. Thus, use of energy-efficient bulbs can actually reduce the amount of mercury released into the environment. Compact fluorescent lamps start poorly when very cold, and most types cannot be dimmed. A few specialist applications are unsuitable for CFLs.|$|E
