40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of a one-millipound pulsed plasma ignition system study. The preliminary data indicate that inductively <b>coupling</b> the ignition <b>plug</b> cathode to the thruster cathode is more beneficial to ignitor plug longevity than resistive coupling. These benefits arise from {{the ability of the}} coupling conductor to control the build-up of a carbonaceous deposit on the plug face. The deposit build-up is a strong function of the peak coupling current experienced during thruster operation. The relationship between the ignitor plug discharge and thruster discharge is shown to be very complex with equivalent circuit elements which are dynamic in nature. A preliminary representation of this equivalent circuit is developed...|$|R

40|$|Following {{the work}} of Phillips (1985), we have {{computed}} site amplification factors for coda waves at many sites in the Long Valley region in the eastern Sierra Nevada. We computed ratios of coda amplitudes measured at 15 stations in and around Long Valley caldera relative to a granitic site, MMPM, for six frequency bands centered at 1. 5, 3. 0, 6. 0, 9. 0, 12. 0, and 15. 0 Hz. All station sites located within the caldera experienced large ground motion amplification at 1. 5 and 3. 0 Hz, ranging between five and 17 {{times that of the}} reference site. However, at higher frequencies, these same sites exhibited significantly less amplification than the reference granite site. This is attributed to the competing effects of an impedance contrast between the basement rock and caldera fill and very high absorption in the caldera fill at high frequencies. Station MMLM, located on top of a volcanic plug, displayed the largest amplitudes of all the sites studied for frequencies between 9. 0 and 15. 0 Hz. A dike structure attached to the <b>plug</b> <b>couples</b> the basement rock to the surface. At high frequencies, th...|$|R
40|$|Pichia pastoris is an {{attractive}} candidate platform for recombinant protein production. Dissolved oxygen {{is one of the}} most important factors in the cultivation of P. pastoris. However, the effect of oxygen on triggering productivity led to ambivalent results. In our earlier work, a two-compartment system, consisting of a single reactor <b>coupled</b> with a <b>plug</b> flow reactor (PFR), has been proposed as a tool to improve protein quantity and quality. The goal of this work was to investigate the effects of frequency (the residence time of broth in the PFR) and amplitude (the dissolved oxygen level in the reactor) of the stress on productivity, titer and physiology. A recombinant P. pastoris strain, which expressed horseradish peroxidase, was used as the model system. Thirteen experiments were performed. Multivariate data analysis was done and the results showed that the residence time did not influence titer, productivity and physiology over the range of residence time studied while dissolved oxygen influenced titer and specific productivity in a quadratic function. In other words, an intermediate level of dissolved oxygen (25 %) showed the highest specific productivity and titter, irrespective of the residence time in the PFR. In turn, the variation of the residence time and dissolved oxygen did not influence growth physiology, as quantified in biomass and carbon dioxide yields...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the benefits of}} a four stroke engine having one intake and one exhaust rotary valve. The rotary valve has a speed of rotation half the crankshaft and defines an open passage that may permit up to extremely sharp opening or closing and very large gas exchange areas. The dual rotary valve design is applied to a racing engine naturally aspirated V-four engine of 1000 cc displacement, gasoline fuelled with central direct injection and spark ignition. The engine is then modeled by using a 1 D engine & gas dynamics simulation software package to assess the potentials of the solution. The improved design produces much larger power densities than the version of the engines with traditional poppet valves revving at higher speeds, with reduced frictional losses, and with larger gas exchange areas while also improving the fuel conversion efficiency thanks to the sharpness of opening or closing events. The novelty in the proposed dual rotary valve system is the combustion chamber of good shape and high compression ratio with central direct injector and spark <b>plug</b> <b>coupled</b> to the large gas exchange areas of the rotary valve system. Finally, jet-ignition is shown as a valuable tool to improve the rate of combustion also in stoichiometric and near stoichiometric racing engines applications with benefits in terms of fuel conversion efficiency and combustion stability...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{approach is}} presented for predicting the species concentrations and temperature profiles of chemically reacting {{flow in the}} non-catalytic partial oxidation of hot coke oven gas (HCOG) in a pilot-scale reformer installed on an operating coke oven. A detailed chemical kinetic model consisting of 2216 reactions with 257 species {{ranging in size from}} the hydrogen radical to coronene was used to predict the chemistries of HCOG reforming and was <b>coupled</b> with a <b>plug</b> model and one-dimensional (1 D) flow with axial diffusion model. The HCOG was a multi-component gas mixture derived from coal dry distillation, and was approximated with more than 40 compounds: H 2, CO, CO 2, CH 4, C 2 hydrocarbons, H 2 O, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons up to coronene. The measured gas temperature profiles were reproduced successfully by solving the energy balance equation accounting for the heat change induced by chemical reactions and heat losses to the surroundings. The approach was evaluated critically by comparing the computed results with experimental data for exit products such as H 2, CO, CO 2, and CH 4, in addition to the total exit gas flow rate. The axial diffusion model slightly improves the predictions of H 2, CO, and CO 2, but significantly improves those of CH 4 and total exit flow rate. The improvements in the model predictions were due primarily to the improved temperature predictions by accounting for axial diffusion in the flow model...|$|R
40|$|Inhalation is an {{important}} exposure route for volatile water contaminants, including disinfection by-products (DBPs). A controlled human study was conducted on six subjects to determine the respiratory uptake of haloketones (HKs) and chloroform, a reference compound, during showering. Breath and air concentrations of the DBPs were measured using gas chromatography and electron capture detector during and following the inhalation exposures. A lower percentage of the HKs (10 %) is released from shower water to air than that of chloroform (56 %) under the experiment conditions due to the lower volatility of the HKs. Breath concentrations of the DBPs were elevated during the inhalation exposure, while breath concentrations decreased rapidly after the exposure. Approximately 85 – 90 % of the inhaled HKs were absorbed, whereas only 70 % of the inhaled chloroform was absorbed for the experiment conditions used. The respiratory uptake of the DBPs was estimated using a linear one-compartment model <b>coupled</b> with a <b>plug</b> flow stream model for the shower system. The internal dose of chloroform normalized to its water concentration was approximately four {{times that of the}} HKs after a 30 -min inhalation exposure. Approximately 0. 3 – 0. 4 % of the absorbed HKs and 2 – 9 % of the absorbed chloroform were expired through lung excretion after the 30 -min exposure. The inhalation exposure from a typical 10 – 15 min shower contributes significantly to the total dose for chloroform in chlorinated drinking water but only to a moderate extent for HKs...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} the strongly inhomogeneous distribution of CO 2 and H 2 O in a synthetic beryl having a peculiar hourglass zoning of Cr {{due to the}} crystal growth. The sample was treated at 800 °C, 500 MPa, in a CO 2 -rich atmosphere. High-resolution FESEM images revealed that the hourglass boundary is not correlated to physical discontinuities, {{at least at the}} scale of tens of nanometers. Polarized FPA-FTIR imaging, on the other side, revealed that the chemical zoning acts as a fast pathway for carbon dioxide diffusion, a feature never observed so far in minerals. The hourglass zone boundary may be thus considered as a structural defect possibly due to the mismatch induced by the different growth rates of each sector. High-resolution synchrotron-light FTIR imaging, in addition, also allows enhancement of CO 2 diffusion along the hourglass boundary to be distinguished from diffusion along fractures in the grain. Therefore, FTIR imaging provides evidence that different diffusion mechanisms may locally combine, suggesting that the distribution of the target molecules needs to be be carefully characterized in experimental studies. This piece of information is mandatory when the study is aimed at extracting diffusion coefficients from analytical profiles. Combination of TOF-SIMS and FPA data shows a significant depletion of type II H 2 O along the hourglass boundary, indicating that water diffusion could be controlled by the distribution of alkali cations within channels, <b>coupled</b> to a <b>plug</b> effect of CO 2...|$|R
40|$|A {{direct and}} highly {{efficient}} synthesis {{has been developed}} for telmisartan, the active ingredient in the widely prescribed antihypertensive drug Micardis®. This approach brings together two functionalized benzimidazoles using a high-yielding Suzuki reaction that can be catalyzed by a homogeneous palladium source or palladium on a solid support. The ability to perform the cross-coupling reaction was facilitated by the regio-controlled preparation of a 2 -bromo- 1 -methylbenzimidazole precursor. The method developed is the first reported selective bromination at the 2 -position of a benzimidazole and produces the first major precursor in high yield (93 %). The second precursor, potassium (4 -methyl- 2 -propylbenzimidazol- 6 -yl) trifluoroborate, was prepared from commercially available 4 -bromo- 2 -methyl- 6 -nitroaniline. An optimized preparation is described that provides a direct three-step process to prepare the benzimidazole and install the borate; this synthetic sequence yields the second precursor with a 90 % yield and no isolated intermediates. The two prepared precursors were combined with a third, commercially available methyl- 4 ’-(bromomethyl) -[1, 1 ’-biphenyl]- 2 -carboxylate, utilizing a short sequence of high yielding reactions to produce the telmisartan with an 83 % yield from these advanced intermediates. This new convergent approach provides the active drug ingredient with an overall yield of 74 % while circumventing many issues associated with the previously reported processes. Additionally, a flow-based synthesis of telmisartan was achieved with no intermediate purifications or solvent exchanges. The continuous process utilizes a tubular reactor system <b>coupled</b> with a <b>plug</b> flow cartridge, ultimately delivering telmisartan in an 86 % isolated yield...|$|R
40|$|Volcanic rocks {{encountered}} {{during the}} Tibet Geotraverse {{have been studied}} in the field, in thin section and by major and trace element geochemistry {{in order to determine}} their most probable original eruptive environment. Rocks from a total of eleven distinct volcanic provinces were studied in this way. They provide evidence for: an active continental margin or post-collision province of probable Devonian/early Carboniferous age in the northern Kunlun mountains; an active continental margin of late Carboniferous age in the southern Lhasa Terrane; Permian continental rifts in the central Qiangtang and central Kunlun Terranes; Triassic volcanic arcs in the southern Lhasa and northern Qiangtang Terranes; a Triassic active continental margin dyke swarm in the northern Kunlun mountains; a Jurassic post-collision or back-arc rifting province in the southern Qiangtang Terrane; a Jurassic island arc in the northern Lhasa Terrane; a Cretaceous post-collision province in the northern Lhasa Terrane possibly extending into the southern Qiangtang Terrane; and a Palaeogene active continental margin in the southern Lhasa Terrane.

However, the composition of this <b>plug,</b> <b>coupled</b> with new and published analyses from Miocene volcanics in the southern Lhasa terrane and from the Pliocene-Recent volcanic province of northwest Tibet, places important constraints on models for post-collision underplating of Tibet by continental lithosphere: any underplating is likely to have been (a) much later than the start of collision, (b) directed beneath Tibet from the north as well as the south, and (c) limited in extent...|$|R
