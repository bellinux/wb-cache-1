25|$|The {{spectrum}} of light emitted from a fluorescent lamp {{is the combination}} of light directly emitted by the mercury vapor, and light emitted by the phosphorescent coating. The spectral lines from the mercury emission and the phosphorescence effect give a combined spectral distribution of light {{that is different from}} those produced by incandescent sources. The relative intensity of light emitted in each narrow band of wavelengths over the visible spectrum is in different proportions compared to that of an incandescent source. Colored objects are perceived differently under light sources with differing spectral distributions. For example, some people find the color rendition produced by some fluorescent lamps to be harsh and displeasing. A healthy person can sometimes appear to have an unhealthy skin tone under fluorescent lighting. The extent to which this phenomenon occurs is related to the light's spectral composition, and may be gauged by its <b>color</b> <b>rendering</b> <b>index</b> (CRI).|$|E

For example, a warm white shade is desirable for indoors, corresponding to correlated color temperatures ≥ 4000 K, together with <b>color</b> <b>rendering</b> <b>indices</b> ≥ 90. Additionally, the luminous efficacy of optical radiation (LER) should be high, preferably ≥ 380 lm/W opt. Conventional white LEDs cannot currently satisfy these requirements simultaneously. On the other hand, color-conversion white LEDs (WLEDs) integrated with quantum dots (QDs) can simultaneously reach such high levels of photometric and colorimetric performance. However, their electrical efficiency performance and limits have been unknown. To understand their potential of luminous efficiency (lm/Welect), we modeled and studied different QD-WLED architectures based on layered QD films and QD blends, all integrated on blue LED chips. The architecture of red, yellow and green emitting QD films (in this order from the chip outwards) is demonstrated to outperform the rest. In this case, for photometrically efficient spectra, the maximum achievable LE is predicted to be 327 lm/W elect. Using a state-of-the-art blue LED reported with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 81. 3 %, the overall WLED PCE is shown to be 69 %.
