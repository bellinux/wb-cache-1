40|$|In recent years, the {{incidence}} of premarital cohabitation has increased dramatically in many countries of Western Europe and in the United States. As cohabitation becomes a more common experience, it is increasingly {{important to understand the}} links between cohabitation and other steps in the process of family formation and dissolution. We focus on the relationship between pre- marital cohabitation and subsequent marital stability, and analyze data from the 1981 Women in Sweden survey using a hazards model approach. Our results indicate that women who premaritally <b>cohabit</b> have almost 80 percent higher marital dissolution rates than those who do not <b>cohabit.</b> Women who <b>cohabit</b> for over three years prior to marriage have over 50 percent higher dissolution rates than women who <b>cohabit</b> for shorter durations. Last, cohabitors and non-cohabitors whose marriages have remained intact for eight years appear to have identical dissolution rates after that time. In addition, we provide evidence that strongly suggests a weaker commitment, {{on the part of those}} who <b>cohabit</b> premaritally, to the institution of marriage. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{researchers}} from Denver suggest that relationships with pre-engagement cohabitation [...] "may wind up sliding into marriage", whereas those that only <b>cohabit</b> post engagement or marriage {{make a more}} clear decision. This could explain their 2006 study of 197 heterosexual couples finding that men who <b>cohabited</b> with their spouse before engagement were less dedicated than men who <b>cohabited</b> only after engagement {{or not at all}} before marriage.In some heterosexual couples, {{women are more likely to}} understand cohabitation as an intermediary step preceding marriage, and men more likely to perceive it without an explicit connection to marriage.|$|R

5|$|In December 2000, {{as part of}} the Second Programme of Law Reform, the Government {{requested}} the Law Reform Commission of Ireland to examine the rights and duties of cohabitees. In April 2004, the commission published a consultation paper with provisional recommendations on legal issues related to <b>cohabiting</b> relationships. The report included an analysis of issues for same-sex couples. Following responses, the final report was launched in December 2006 by Justice Minister Michael McDowell.|$|E

50|$|Conflicting {{studies on}} the effect of {{cohabitation}} on subsequent marriage have been published. In countries where the majority of people disapprove of unmarried individuals living together, or a minority of the population <b>cohabits</b> before marriage, marriages resulting from cohabitation are more prone to divorce. But in a study on European countries, those where around half of the population <b>cohabits</b> before marriage, cohabitation is not selective of divorce-prone individuals, and no difference in couples that have <b>cohabited</b> before and after marriage is observed. In countries such as Italy, the increased risk of marital disruption for people who experienced premarital cohabitation can be entirely attributed to the selection of the most divorce-prone into cohabitation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explored}} {{factors associated}} with the disposition toward cohabitation. Analysis of the data revealed that, among the total sample, a willingness to <b>cohabit</b> is related to being older, lower levels of religiosity, more liberal attitudes toward sexual behavior, less traditional views of marriage, and less traditional views of sex roles. However, analysis further indicated a gender {{difference in the way}} various factors are associated with the disposition to <b>cohabit.</b> For the female subsample these factors are generally related to the willingness to <b>cohabit.</b> However, {{this was not the case}} for the male subsample. Only two factors were significantly related to their willingness to cohabitâ€” lower levels of religiosity and more tolerant views of rape...|$|R

5|$|Initially {{to report}} by March 2006, the group {{presented}} its {{report to the}} Government in November 2006. They recommended that a civil partnership scheme would resolve most of the issues for same-sex and <b>cohabiting</b> couples, while providing less benefits than marriage. Offering civil marriage to same-sex couples {{would be open to}} constitutional challenge. They also recommended a legal presumption of partnership for couples which have lived together for three years, or have children together. No recommendations were made for couples in non-conjugal relationships due to lack of research. The cabinet reviewed the report, but no legislation was introduced before the 2007 general election, and in the intervening period the Government rejected opposition legislation, saying that legislation should await the Supreme Court appeal in Zappone v. Revenue Commissioners.|$|E
5|$|The couple's first child, Mary Prudentia Hogg, {{was born}} in November 1827. Her parents did their best not to spread the news, because she was born soon after they began <b>cohabiting.</b> Mary Prudentia died in May 1829. Jane gave birth to their second daughter, Prudentia, in 1836, and Mary Shelley was {{selected}} as her godmother. Hogg's friendship with Mary Shelley was disrupted several years later, however, when she republished Percy Shelley's Queen Mab in 1839. Hogg rebuked her for leaving out its previous dedication to Harriet Shelley, {{and they did not}} communicate with each other for several years.|$|E

5|$|Bees may be solitary or {{may live}} in {{various types of}} communities. Sociality, of several {{different}} types, appears to have evolved independently many times within the bees. The most advanced of these are species with eusocial colonies; these are characterised by having cooperative brood care and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive adults, plus overlapping generations. This division of labour creates specialized groups within eusocial societies which are called castes. In some species, groups of <b>cohabiting</b> females may be sisters, {{and if there is}} a division of labour within the group, they are considered semisocial. The group is called eusocial if, in addition, the group consists of a mother (the queen) and her daughters (workers). When the castes are purely behavioural alternatives, with no morphological differentiation other than size, the system is considered primitively eusocial, as in many paper wasps; when the castes are morphologically discrete, the system is considered highly eusocial.|$|E
5|$|Civil partnerships, {{introduced}} by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar, but not equal to, those of civil marriage. The ability {{to enter into a}} civil partnership ended on 16 November 2015. Constitutional protections granted to spouses, such as the spouse of a witness not being compelled to give evidence against their spouse in most cases, is one example of protections granted under civil partnerships. Spouses may further claim privilege in so far as necessary to protect the constitutional right to marital privacy. No such constitutional protections exist for civil partnerships. Further inequalities in relation to the family, immigration and other types of Irish law exist. The legislation provides rights for participants in long-term <b>cohabiting</b> relationships (opposite- or same-sex) who have not entered into a civil partnership or marriage. The following entry focuses primarily on the same-sex civil partnership aspect of the Act, as opposed to the cohabitation aspect.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} held oral {{hearings in}} Spring 2005 and received an unexpectedly {{large volume of}} written submissions with at least 60% being opposed to any constitutional changes to marriage or the family, including from members of Pro Life Campaign, Family Solidarity and Mother and Child Campaign. The final report, the Tenth interim report of the committee, was launched by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on 24 January 2006. It recommended no change to the constitutional definitions, as it expected such a referendum to fail. It suggested that there should instead be legislation for a civil partnership registration open to same-sex or opposite-sex couples which would confer succession, maintenance and taxation rights. Controversially, it also recommended that the 'presumed' recognition of <b>cohabiting</b> partners by the courts, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, should also be legislated for, but only for opposite-sex couples. The basis for the limitation {{was that it would}} be easy for the courts to determine the validity of an opposite-sex relationship if there were children.|$|E
