5|$|The {{standard}} <b>connectors</b> {{were designed}} to be more robust than many past <b>connectors.</b> This is because USB is hot-pluggable, and the <b>connectors</b> would be used more frequently, and perhaps with less care, than previous <b>connectors.</b>|$|E
5|$|For smaller {{devices such}} as digital cameras, smartphones, and tablet computers, various smaller <b>connectors</b> have been used – the USB-standard first {{introduced}} the Mini-USB <b>connectors.</b>|$|E

5|$|The micro {{format is}} the most durable {{from the point of}} view of {{designed}} insertion lifetime. The standard and mini <b>connectors</b> have a design lifetime of 1,500 insertion-removal cycles, the improved Mini-B <b>connectors</b> increased this to 5,000. The micro <b>connectors</b> were designed with frequent charging of portable devices in mind, so have a design life of 10,000 cycles and also place the flexible contacts, which wear out sooner, on the easily replaced cable, while the more durable rigid contacts are located in the receptacles. Likewise, the springy component of the retention mechanism, parts that provide required gripping force, were also moved into plugs on the cable side.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} <b>connector</b> for CoaXPress is a 75 Ω BNC <b>connector.</b> A second <b>connector</b> {{option is}} the DIN 1.0/2.3 <b>connector.</b> Solutions with a 5W5 <b>connector</b> {{have also been}} demonstrated, {{but this is not}} officially supported by the CoaXPress consortium.|$|R
5000|$|Jack {{commonly}} {{refers to}} a <b>connector</b> often with the female electrical contact or socket, and is the [...] "more fixed" [...] <b>connector</b> of a <b>connector</b> pair. Plug commonly {{refers to a}} movable <b>connector,</b> often (but not always) with the male electrical contact or pin, and is the movable (less fixed) <b>connector</b> of a <b>connector</b> pair.|$|R
5|$|USB {{ports and}} <b>connectors</b> are often {{color-coded}} to distinguish their different functions and USB versions. These colors {{are not part}} of the USB specification and can vary between manufacturers; for example, USB3.0 specification mandates appropriate color-coding while it only recommends blue inserts for standard-A USB3.0 <b>connectors</b> and plugs.|$|E
5|$|Joysticks, keypads, tablets {{and other}} human-interface devices (HIDs) are also {{progressively}} migrating from MIDI, and PC game port <b>connectors</b> to USB.|$|E

For high-end motherboards and processors, more power is required, therefore EPS12V has an 8-pin <b>connector.</b>|$|R
5|$|The USB 3.1 Type-C {{connector}} is {{an emerging}} standard which has replaced legacy video <b>connectors</b> such as mDP, Thunderbolt, HDMI and VGA in mobile devices. USB-C <b>connectors</b> can transmit DisplayPort video to docks and displays using standard USB Type-C cables or Type-C to DisplayPort cables and adapters; USB-C also supports HDMI adapters which perform active conversion from DisplayPort to HDMI 1.4 or 2.0. DisplayPort Alternate Mode for USB Type-C specification {{was published in}} 2015. USB Type-C chipsets {{are not required to}} include Dual-mode trasnmitters and only support DisplayPort LVDS protocol, so passive DP-HDMI adapters would not work with Type-C sources.|$|E
5|$|The USB {{standard}} specifies relatively loose tolerances for compliant USB <b>connectors</b> {{to minimize}} physical incompatibilities in <b>connectors</b> from different vendors. To address a weakness present {{in some other}} connector standards, the USB specification also defines limits {{to the size of}} a connecting device in the area around its plug. This was done to prevent a device from blocking adjacent ports due to the size of the cable strain relief mechanism (usually molding integral with the cable outer insulation) at the connector. Compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant extension cable that does.|$|E
5|$|The spring {{contacts}} in the <b>connectors</b> eventually relax and wear out with repeated cycles of plugging and unplugging. The lifetime of a type-A plug is approximately 1,500 connect/disconnect cycles.|$|E

5000|$|From ANSI E1.11 - 2008 section 7: 7.1.2 Concession {{for use of}} an {{alternate}} <b>connector</b> (NCC DMX512-A)A concession to use {{an alternate}} <b>connector</b> is available only when it is physically impossible to mount a 5-pin XLR <b>connector</b> on the product.

5|$|The {{standard}} <b>connectors</b> were deliberately {{intended to}} enforce the directed topology of a USB network: type-A receptacles on host devices that supply power and type-B receptacles on target devices that draw power. This prevents users from accidentally connecting two USB power supplies to each other, {{which could lead to}} short circuits and dangerously high currents, circuit failures, or even fire. USB does not support cyclic networks and the standard <b>connectors</b> from incompatible USB devices are themselves incompatible.|$|E
5|$|USB, {{short for}} Universal Serial Bus, is an {{industry}} standard that defines cables, <b>connectors</b> and communications protocols for connection, communication, and power supply between computers and devices.|$|E
5|$|Any DVI-to-HDMI adapter can {{function}} as an HDMI-to-DVI adapter (and vice versa). Typically, the only limitation is {{the gender of the}} adapter's <b>connectors</b> and the gender of the cables and sockets it is used with.|$|E
5|$|Type D: This Micro <b>connector</b> shrinks the <b>connector</b> size to {{something}} resembling a micro-USB <b>connector,</b> measuring only 6.4mm × 2.8mm For comparison, a micro-USB <b>connector</b> is 6.85mm × 1.8mm and a USB Type-A <b>connector</b> is 11.5mm × 4.5mm. It keeps the standard 19 pins of types A and C, but the pin assignment {{is different from}} both.|$|R

5|$|Developed {{at roughly}} {{the same time as the}} USB3.1 specification, but {{distinct}} from it, the USBType-C Specification 1.0 was finalized in August 2014 and defines a new small reversible-plug connector for USB devices. The Type-C plug connects to both hosts and devices, replacing various Type-A and Type-B <b>connectors</b> and cables with a standard meant to be future-proof.|$|E
5|$|High-speed (HS) rate of 480Mbit/s was {{introduced}} in 2001. All hi-speed devices are capable of falling back to full-bandwidth operation if necessary; i.e., they are backward compatible with USB1.1 standard. <b>Connectors</b> are identical for USB2.0 and USB1.x.|$|E
5|$|However, {{some of this}} {{directed}} topology is {{lost with}} the advent of multi-purpose USB connections (such as USB On-The-Go in smartphones, and USB-powered Wi-Fi routers), which require A-to-A, B-to-B, and sometimes Y/splitter cables. See the USB On-The-Go <b>connectors</b> section below for a more detailed summary description.|$|E
