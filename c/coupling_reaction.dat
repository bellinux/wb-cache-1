5|$|After the {{completion}} of the <b>coupling</b> <b>reaction,</b> {{a small percentage of the}} solid support-bound 5'-OH groups (0.1 to 1%) remains unreacted and needs to be permanently blocked from further chain elongation to prevent the formation of oligonucleotides with an internal base deletion commonly referred to as (n-1) shortmers. The unreacted 5'-hydroxy groups are, to a large extent, acetylated by the capping mixture.|$|E

40|$|Copper-catalyzed (or -mediated) {{asymmetric}} <b>coupling</b> <b>reactions</b> {{have received}} significant attention {{over the past}} few years. Especially the <b>coupling</b> <b>reactions</b> of aryl or alkyl halides with nucleophiles became a very powerful tool for the formation of C–C, C–N, C–O and other carbon–heteroatom bonds {{as well as for the}} construction of heteroatom-containing ring systems. This review summarizes the recent progress in copper-catalyzed asymmetric <b>coupling</b> <b>reactions</b> for the formation of C–C and carbon–heteroatom bonds...|$|R
5|$|Although the {{nucleic base}} of {{guanosine}} and 2'-deoxyguanosine {{does have an}} exocyclic amino group, its basicity is low to an extent {{that it does not}} react with phosphoramidites under the conditions of the <b>coupling</b> <b>reaction.</b> However, a phosphoramidite derived from the N2-unprotected 5'-O-DMT-2'-deoxyguanosine is poorly soluble in acetonitrile, the solvent commonly used in oligonucleotide synthesis. In contrast, the N2-protected versions of the same compound dissolve in acetonitrile well and hence are widely used. Nucleic bases adenine and cytosine bear the exocyclic amino groups reactive with the activated phosphoramidites under the conditions of the <b>coupling</b> <b>reaction.</b> By the use of additional steps in the synthetic cycle or alternative coupling agents and solvent systems, the oligonucleotide chain assembly may be carried out using dA and dC phosphoramidites with unprotected amino groups. However, these approaches currently remain in the research stage. In routine oligonucleotide synthesis, exocyclic amino groups in nucleosides are kept permanently protected over {{the entire length of the}} oligonucleotide chain assembly.|$|E

25|$|Reductive {{coupling}} is a <b>coupling</b> <b>reaction</b> of {{aryl halides}} with a stoichiometric equivalent of copper metal {{that occurs in}} the Ullmann reaction. In {{an example of a}} present-day cross <b>coupling</b> <b>reaction</b> called decarboxylative coupling, a catalytic amount of Cu(I) displaces a carboxyl group forming the arylcopper (ArCu) intermediate. Simultaneously, a palladium catalyst converts an aryl bromide to the organopalladium intermediate (Ar'PdBr), and on transmetallation the biaryl is formed from ArPdAr'.|$|E
50|$|Manganese-mediated <b>coupling</b> <b>reactions</b> are radical <b>coupling</b> <b>reactions</b> between enolizable {{carbonyl}} compounds and unsaturated compounds initiated by a manganese(III) salt, typically manganese(III) acetate.

50|$|The {{outcomes}} of manganese-mediated <b>coupling</b> <b>reactions</b> depend {{on both the}} structure of the substrate(s) and the reaction conditions.

25|$|The {{coupling}} of ring A {{and ring}} C created the 8 membered B ring. One connection was made via a nucleophilic {{addition of a}} vinyllithium compound to an aldehyde and the other connection through a pinacol <b>coupling</b> <b>reaction</b> of two aldehydes (Scheme 4).|$|E
25|$|As {{illustrated}} in Retrosynthetic Scheme I, Taxol {{was derived from}} diol 7.2 by an ester bond formation, according to the Ojima-Holton method. This diol comes from carbonate 6.3 {{by the addition of}} phenyllithium. The oxetane ring in compound 6.3 was obtained via an SN2 reaction involving a mesylate derived from acetate 4.9. Ring B was closed via a McMurry reaction involving dialdehyde 4.8 which ultimately was derived from aldehyde 4.2 and hydrazone 3.6 using a Shapiro <b>coupling</b> <b>reaction.</b>|$|E

25|$|A Shapiro {{reaction}} of the vinyllithium compound derived from hydrazone 4.1 with aldehyde 4.2 makes the first connection that will become the B ring. The control of stereochemistry in 4.3 {{is thought to be}} derived from the relative hindrance of the Si face in the orientation shown on the right, due to the proximity of the axial methyl group. Epoxidation with vanadyl(acetylacetate) converted alkene 4.3 to epoxide 4.4, which, upon reduction with lithium aluminium hydride, gave diol 4.5. This diol was then protected as carbonate ester 4.6. The carbonate group also served to create rigidity in the ring structure for the imminent pinacol <b>coupling</b> <b>reaction.</b> The two silyl ether groups were removed, and diol 4.7 was then oxidized to give dialdehyde 4.8 using N-methylmorpholine N-oxide {{in the presence of a}} catalytic amount of tetrapropylammonium perruthenate. In the final step of the formation of Ring B, a pinacol coupling using conditions developed by McMurry (titanium(III) chloride and a zinc/copper alloy) gave diol 4.9.|$|E
