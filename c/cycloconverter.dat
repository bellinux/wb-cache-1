The single-phase generators were eventually retired in the late 1970s due to concerns of a turbine failure in another station. The generators were replaced by two transformers to reduce from another three-phase power source to existing single-phase catenary power. Eventually, the transformers were replaced by two solid-state <b>cycloconverter</b> instead.|$|E
50|$|With recent device advances, newer {{forms of}} <b>cyclo{{converters}}</b> are being developed, such as matrix converters. The first {{change that is}} first noticed is that matrix converters utilize bi-directional, bipolar switches. A single phase to a single phase matrix converter consists of a matrix of 9 switches connecting the three input phases to the tree output phase. Any input phase and output phase can be connected together at any time without connecting any two switches from the same phase at the same time; otherwise this will cause a short circuit of the input phases. Matrix converters are lighter, more compact and versatile than other converter solutions. As a result, {{they are able to}} achieve higher levels of integration, higher temperature operation, broad output frequency and natural bi-directional power flow suitable to regenerate energy back to the utility.|$|R
40|$|A new PWM {{approach}} {{using three}} state switching of negatively coupled inductors {{can be applied}} to any basic dc-to-dc converter to form single-phase dc-to-ac inverters. Current reference programming gives improvements in linearity, small-signal dynamics, and pulsed-load response. The current programming loops of the flyback and boost inverters are stable at all operating points. New multiple output magnetic structures are introduced that apply space and time multiplexing of magnetics to give non-interacting outputs. The magnetics are analysed for different operating conditions. The inverters with two independent outputs are derived by use of the multiple output magnetics. These are used to form the three-phase versions of the inverters, The corresponding three-phase ac-to-dc rectifiers are also derived with close to ideal current waveforms as well as power factor correction capabilities. Finally, to complete the family of power converters the polyphase ac-to-ac <b>cycloconverters</b> are derived incorporating the qualities of both the inverters and the rectifiers. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a universal fuel-cell-based grid-connected inverter design with digital-signal-processor-based digi-tal control. The inverter {{has a direct}} power conversion mechanism with a high-frequency zero-voltage-switched dc/ac primary-side converter followed {{by a pair of}} ac/ac <b>cycloconverters</b> that operates either in parallel or in series to simultaneously address the issues of universal output and high efficiency. The critical design issues focus on the impact and optimization of transformer leakage inductance with regard to effectiveness of zero voltage switching of a primary-side converter, duty-cycle loss, resonance, and voltage spike that has effect on the breakdown voltage rating of the cyclo-converter devices. An additional concept of dynamic transformer tapping has been explored to address the impact of varying input voltage on secondary-side voltage spike and inverter efficiency.

They are commutated direct frequency converters that are synchronised by a supply line. The cycloconverters output voltage waveforms have complex harmonics with the higher order harmonics being filtered by the machine inductance. Causing the machine current to have fewer harmonics, while the remaining harmonics causes losses and torque pulsations. Note that in a <b>cycloconverter,</b> unlike other converters, there are no inductors or capacitors, i.e. no storage devices. For this reason, the instantaneous input power and the output power are equal.|$|E

AC converters that allow the user to change the frequency are simply referred to as frequency converters for AC to AC conversion. Under frequency converters there are three different types of converters that are typically used: <b>cycloconverter,</b> matrix converter, DC link converter (aka AC/DC/AC converter).|$|E
