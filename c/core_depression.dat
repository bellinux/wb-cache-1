MethodBilateral femoral head necrosis models of rabbit were established by steroid injection. A total of 48 rabbits (96 femoral head necrosis) were randomly divided into 4 groups: Group A, control group with 12 rabbits, 24 femoral head necrosis; Group B, treated with rhBMP- 2 /PLGA implantation after <b>core</b> <b>depression,</b> with 12 rabbits, 24 femoral head necrosis; Group C, treated with rhBMP- 2 implantation after <b>core</b> <b>depression,</b> with 12 rabbits, 24 femoral head necrosis; Group D treated with <b>core</b> <b>depression</b> group without implantation, with 12 rabbits, 24 femoral head necrosis. All animals were sacrificed after 12 weeks. The ability of repairing bone defect was evaluated by X-ray radiograph. Bone mineral density analysis of the defect regions were {{used to evaluate the}} level of ossification. The morphologic change and bone formation was assessed by HE staining. The angiogenesis was evaluated by VEGF immunohistochemistry. ResultsThe osteogenetic ability and quality of femoral head necrosis in group B were better than those of other groups after 12 weeks by X-ray radiograph and morphologic investigation. And the angiogenesis in group B was better than other groups. Group C had similar osteogenetic quality of femoral head necrosis and angiogenesis with group D. ConclusionThe treatment of rhBMP- 2 /PLGA implantation after <b>core</b> <b>depression</b> can promote the repair of rabbit femoral head necrosis. It is a promising and efficient synthetic bone material to treat the femoral head necrosis...|$|E

40|$|Background: While {{depression}} and certain cardiac biomarkers {{are associated with}} acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the relationship between them remains largely unexplored. We examined the association between depressive symptoms and biomarkers in patients with AMI. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study using data from 103 patients with AMI between March 2013 and September 2014. The levels of depression, N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and troponin I (TnI) were measured at baseline. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups: those with depressive symptoms and those without depressive symptoms according to Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) score. Baseline comparisons between two groups were made using Student's t-test for continuous variables, Chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, and Wilcoxon test for variables in skewed distribution. Binomial logistic regression and multivariate linear regression were performed to assess the association between depressive symptoms and biomarkers while adjusting for demographic and clinical variables. Results: Patients with depressive symptoms had significantly higher NT-proBNP levels as compared to patients without depressive symptoms (1135. 0 [131. 5, 2474. 0] vs. 384. 0 [133. 0, 990. 0], Z = − 2. 470, P = 0. 013). Depressive symptoms were associated with higher NT-proBNP levels (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 348, 95 % CI: 1. 344 to 4. 103, P = 0. 003) and higher body mass index (OR = 1. 169, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 016 to 1. 345, P = 0. 029). The total SDS score was associated with the NT-proBNP level (β= 0. 327, 95 % CI: 1. 674 to 6. 119, P = 0. 001) after multivariable adjustment. In particular, NT-proBNP was associated with three of the depressive dimensions, including <b>core</b> <b>depression</b> (β = 0. 299, 95 % CI: 0. 551 to 2. 428, P = 0. 002), cognitive depression (β = 0. 320, 95 % CI: 0. 476 to 1. 811, P = 0. 001), and somatic depression (β = 0. 333, 95 % CI: 0. 240 to 0. 847, P = 0. 001). Neither the overall depressive symptomatology nor the individual depressive dimensions were associated with TnI levels. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms, especially <b>core</b> <b>depression,</b> cognitive depression, and somatic depression, were related to high NT-proBNP levels in patients with AMI...|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{antidepressant}} treatment success {{should be}} viewed {{as the result of the}} cumulative effects of treatment at each stage of major depressive disorder (MDD), and as a balance between efficacy and tolerability/safety. Depression is a heterogeneous disorder and different mechanisms of action of different antidepressants probably capitalize on this response heterogeneity. Results from clinical trials with agomelatine, a melatonergic receptor agonist (MT(1) /MT(2)) and 5 HT(2 C) receptor antagonist, have shown that it is efficacious in both the acute phase and the continuation phase of treatment of depression. Agomelatine's efficacy is observed in different depressive symptom clusters (<b>core</b> <b>depression</b> symptoms, sleep symptoms, anxiety, retardation, somatic symptoms, and work and activities). Active comparator trials show at least comparable efficacy with other antidepressants (paroxetine, venlafaxine, sertraline, fluoxetine) and efficacy has also been demonstrated in severe depression and in treating anxiety symptoms associated with major depression. The tolerability profile shows some clinically significant advantages especially in the lower incidence of treatment emergent sexual dysfunction and of weight gain, two adverse events experienced by patients as most bothersome.

40|$|<b>Core</b> {{symptoms}} of <b>depression</b> are {{a combination of}} psychological and somatic symptoms, often combined with psychomotor and cognitive disturbances. Diagnostic classification of depression including the concepts of melancholic, endogenous, or severe depression describe severely depressed patients suffering {{from most of the}} core symptoms, together with clinical characteristics of a cyclic unipolar or bipolar course, lower placebo response rates, higher response rates to electroconvulsive therapy, to antidepressant treatments with dually or mixed modes of action, or to lithium augmentation. Higher rates ofhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity and specific electroencephalograph patterns have also been shown in this patient group.

40|$|Background: A {{limited number}} of studies {{examined}} anxiety in Parkinson disease (PD). Questionable validity of the Diagnostic and StatisticalManual ofMentalDisorders (FourthEdition) defined anxiety disorders in PDpopulation aswell as a lackof validated rating scales hampered the investigation in this field. Objective: To screen for prevalenceof anxiety symptomsand their associateddemographic and clinical features in an outpatient-based cohort with PD. Patients andmethods: A consecutive series of 360 patients with PDunderwent investigation with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), the 17 -itemHamiltonDepression Rating Scale, Neuropsychiatric Inven-tory, section E (anxiety), motor scoring with Hoehn and Yahr staging, the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, and cognitive screening with the Mini-Mental State Examination. Results: In all, 136 (37. 8 %) patients with PD of our cohort had anxiety symptoms, whereas bothdepression andanxietywere recorded in 5. 6 %of the patients,while in 56. 7 %neither anxietynor depressionwaspresent. Female gender, motor disability, and <b>core</b> <b>depression</b> symptomswere themainmarkers of anxiety in patients with PD.

40|$|Background: Several {{patients}} with unipolar depression present with prominent dysphoric mood.

Methods: Thirty-five newly admitted out{{patients with}} substantial anger, irritability, aggressiveness or hostility who were diagnosed a DSM-IV unipolar depressive disorder were rated on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Clinical Global Improvement (CGI) scale, and a scale for the rapid dimensional assessment (SVARAD), were prescribed an SSRI and an anticonvulsant (usually valproate), and were followed up for 12 weeks. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test for within-subject changes in scale scores over time. Results: Thirty-two and 23 patients attended the follow-up visits 4 and 12 weeks later, respectively. Significant decreases (p <. 001) were observed in HDRS total score, HDRS and SVARAD anxiety factors, HDRS and SVARAD <b>core</b> <b>depression</b> factors, and SVARAD anger/irritability factor. Adjusting for age or gender did not change the results. Most patients (82 %) were rated as improved or much improved on the CGI. Conclusion: A lthough our study has several limitations, we observed a remarkable improvement in most unipolar depressed outpatients with dysphoric mood treated with an SSRI and an anticonvulsant. The effectiveness of anticonvulsants might be linked to their action on symptoms of aggression and behavioural activation. © 2007 Pasquini et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Depression is {{a leading}} cause of {{disability}} worldwide. A strong empirical literature has identified a role for inflammation in the pathophysiology of depression, yet evidence suggests that the precise nature of this relationship is complex and still largely undefined. It has been suggested that a barrier to understanding the role of inflammation in depression is the tendency to conceptualize and measure depression as a homogeneous, unitary construct. Instead, an approach that “deconstructs the construct” of depression and examines how inflammation impacts core processes or endophenotypes of depression may lead to new insights into the nature of the inflammation-depression link. The first part of this dissertation consists of an integrative review of the literature linking inflammation and <b>core</b> processes of <b>depression.</b> The purpose of the review is to bring together the depression, endophenotype, and inflammation literatures in order to identify <b>core</b> processes of <b>depression</b> likely to be impacted by inflammation, which can be targets of investigation in future work. The review first identifies key endophenotypes of depression that have been evaluated in at least preliminary work within the context of inflammation; then, the evidence examining a potential role for inflammation in each of these <b>core</b> processes of <b>depression</b> is reviewed and evaluated. Overall, existing evidence supports a role of inflammation in modulating several key domains relevant to depression, including cognitive biases, reward processing, and somatic symptoms. The second section of this dissertation presents an empirical study aimed at testing several of the inflammation-depression endophenotype links identified in the review paper. In this study, an influenza vaccine was used to elicit increases in circulating inflammation, and resulting effects on multiple processes relevant to depression were examined, including mood, fatigue, reward processing, cognitive functioning, and attentional bias. Findings indicated that increases in inflammation were associated with attentional avoidance of positive stimuli, as well as improvements in working memory and reward learning. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which inflammation may contribute to depression (attentional bias), as well as provide insight into the effects of low-grade inflammation on aspects of memory and reward processing...|$|R
50|$|On August 21, the NHC {{noted that}} {{an area of}} low {{pressure}} could form well south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California over subsequent days.

Madeline began a period of rapid intensification thereafter, and with a cloud-filled eye surrounded by a ring of deep convection, was upgraded to a Category 3 hurricane by 21:00 UTC before ultimately peaking as a 130 mph (215 km/h) Category 4 hurricane early the next day.|$|R
40|$|Background The {{symptoms}} for Major Depression (MD) {{defined in}} the DSM- 5 differ markedly from symptoms assessed in common rating scales, and the empirical question about <b>core</b> <b>depression</b> symptoms is unresolved. Here we conceptualize depression as a complex dynamic system of interacting symptoms to examine what symptoms are most central to driving depressive processes. Methods We constructed a network of 28 depression symptoms assessed via the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS- 30) in 3, 463 depressed outpatients from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR∗D) study. We estimated the centrality of all IDS- 30 symptoms, and compared the centrality of DSM and non-DSM symptoms; centrality reflects the connectedness of each symptom with all other symptoms. Results A network with 28 intertwined symptoms emerged, and symptoms differed substantially in their centrality values. Both DSM symptoms (e. g., sad mood) and non-DSM symptoms (e. g., anxiety) {{were among the most}} central symptoms, and DSM criteria were not more central than non-DSM symptoms. Limitations Many subjects enrolled in STAR∗D reported comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions which may have affected symptom presentation. Conclusion The network perspective neither supports the standard psychometric notion that depression symptoms are equivalent indicators of MD, nor the common assumption that DSM symptoms of depression are of higher clinical relevance than non-DSM depression symptoms. The findings suggest the value of research focusing on especially central symptoms to increase the accuracy of predicting outcomes such as the course of illness, probability of relapse, and treatment response...|$|E

Little {{is known about}} whether depression symptoms present differ- ently in ADHD compared to the general population, or how reliable young people with ADHD are at reporting these symptoms. This study aimed to describe depression symptoms in a clinical ADHD sample compared to a population sample, and compare self-reports of depression symptoms with parent-reports. Methods: Two hundred and forty-nine children with ADHD and their parents completed follow-up questionnaires around 5 years after {{taking part in a}} Cardiff University ADHD study. Child depression symptoms were measured using parent- and child-reported Mood and Feelings Questionnaires (MFQ) and compared to a population sample with MFQ data (n = 1460). Within both samples, child- and parent-reported depression symptoms were com- pared. Results: Although the proﬁle of depression symptoms was similar between young people with ADHD and those in the general population, depression symptoms were much more common in the ADHD sample (parent-rated MFQ score = 24. 52 vs. 9. 39; child-rated = 21. 02 vs. 11. 86). The most common symptoms in both samples included irritability, restlessness and concentration difﬁculties, with <b>core</b> <b>depression</b> symptoms such as feeling miserable/unhappy also prominent. Within the ADHD sample, but not the population sample, children reported depression symptoms less frequently than their parents. Conclusions: Young people with ADHD are at high risk of experiencing symptoms of depression but may under-report the severity of their symptoms. Obtaining parent reports of depression symptoms in this group may be important to avoid missing key indica- tors of risk...|$|E
40|$|Background Oxidative {{stress is}} implicated in both {{depression}} and anxiety, {{but it is}} currently unclear whether this relates to syndromal diagnoses or trans-diagnostic dimensional symptoms. We {{examined the relationship between}} oxidative stress and severity of depression and anxiety symptoms in individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Methods Plasma oxidative stress markers F 2 -isoprostanes and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and the antioxidant reduced glutathione (GSH), were assessed in 69 physically healthy, medication-free MDD subjects. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A) and Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) Rating Scales. Total HAM-A and HAM-D scores, along with “core” anxiety and depression subscales, and individual HAM-D items “psychic anxiety” and “depressed mood,” were related to oxidative stress markers. Analyses controlled for age, sex, BMI, and smoking. Results Total HAM-A ratings were positively associated with F 2 -isoprostanes (β=. 26, p=. 042) and GSSG (β=. 25, p=. 049), but not GSH (β=. 05, p=. 711). Core anxiety severity was positively associated with F 2 -isoprostanes (β=. 34, p=. 012) and GSSG, although this did not reach significance (β=. 24, p=. 074). None of the biological markers were significantly associated with total HAM-D or <b>core</b> <b>depression</b> ratings (all p>. 13). Subjects scoring high on “psychic anxiety” had elevated F 2 -isoprostanes (p=. 030) and GSSG (p=. 020). This was not seen with “depressed mood” scores (all p>. 12). Limitations We assessed peripheral oxidative markers, but their relationship to the brain is unclear. Conclusions Oxidative stress is more closely related to anxiety than depression symptoms in MDD.

40|$|Diurnal {{variation}} {{of depressive symptoms}} appears {{to be part of}} the <b>core</b> of <b>depression.</b> Yet longitudinal investigation of an individual's pattern regularity, relation to clinical state, and clinical improvement reveals little homogeneity. Morning lows, afternoon slump, evening worsening - all can occur during a single depressive episode. Mood variability, or the propensity to produce mood swings, appears to be the characteristic that most predicts capacity to respond to treatment. Laboratory studies have revealed that mood, like physiological variables such as core body temperature, is regulated by a circadian clock interacting with the sleep homeostat. Many depressed patients, particularly bipolar patients, show delayed sleep phase (late chronotype). Even small shifts in the timing and duration of sleep affect mood state (sleep deprivation and sleep phase advance have an antidepressant effect).

40|$|Background:Mood {{instability}} and irritability {{are related to}} depression but are not considered core symptoms. Instruments typically code clusters of symptoms {{that are used to}} define syndromic depression but the place of mood {{instability and}} irritability has been under-investigated. Whether they are core symptoms can be examined using Rasch analysis. Method:We used the UK Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2000 data (n = 8, 338) to determine whether the 9 ICD / DSM symptoms, plus mood instability (MI) and irritability constitute a valid depression scale. Rasch analysis was used, a method concerned with ensuring that items constitute a robust scale and tests whether the count of symptoms reflects an underlying interval-level measure. Two random samples of 500 were drawn, serving as calibration and validation samples. As part of the analysis, we examined whether the candidate symptoms were unidimensional, followed a Guttman pattern, were locally independent, invariant with respect to age and sex, and reliably distinguished different levels of depression severity. Results: A subset of five symptoms (sad, no interest, sleep, cognition, suicidal ideas) together with mood instability and irritability satisfactorily fits the Rasch model. However, these seven symptoms do not separate clinically depressed persons {{from the rest of the}} population with adequate reliability (Cronbach  = 0. 58; Person Separation Index = 0. 35), but could serve as a basis for scale development. Likewise, the original 9 DSM depression symptoms failed to achieve satisfactory reliability (Cronbach  = 0. 67; Person Separation Index = 0. 51). Limitations: The time frame over which symptoms were experienced varied and some required recall over the last year. Symptoms other than those examined here might also be <b>core</b> <b>depression</b> symptoms. Conclusion: Mood instability and irritability are candidate core symptoms of the depressive syndrome and should be part of its clinical assessment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Depressive {{symptoms}} and chronic disease have {{adverse effects on}} patients' health-related quality of life (H-RQOL). However, {{little is known about}} this effect on H-RQOL when only the two core depressive symptoms - loss of interest and depressed mood - are considered. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate H-RQOL in the presence of loss of interest and depressed mood at a general medical outpatient unit. Methods We evaluated 553 patients at their first attendance at a general medical outpatient unit of a teaching hospital. H-RQOL was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study 36 -item Short-Form Health Survey (SF- 36). Depressed mood and loss of interest were assessed by the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) -Patient Questionnaire. A physician performed the diagnosis of chronic diseases by clinical judgment and classified them in 13 possible pre-defined categories. We used multiple linear regression to investigate associations between each domain of H-RQOL and our two <b>core</b> <b>depression</b> symptoms. The presence of chronic diseases and demographic variables were included in the models as covariates. Results Among the 553 patients, 70. 5 % were women with a mean age of 41. 0 years (range 18 - 85, SD ± 15. 4). Loss of interest was reported by 54. 6 %, and depressed mood by 59. 7 % of the patients. At least one chronic disease was diagnosed in 59. 5 % of patients; cardiovascular disease was the most prevalent, affecting 20. 6 % of our patients. Loss of interest and depressed mood was significantly associated with decreased scores in all domains of H-RQOL after adjustment for possible confounders. The presence of any chronic disease was associated with a decrease in the domain of vitality. The analysis of each individual chronic disease category revealed that no category was associated with a decrease in more than one domain of H-RQOL. Conclusion Loss of interest and depressed mood were associated with significant decreases in H-RQOL. We recommend these simple tests for screening in general practice. </p...|$|E
40|$|Depression is {{a common}} comorbid {{condition}} in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) which causes substantial burden of disease. Furthermore, depression negatively impacts the medical prognosis of CHD patients. After an acute coronary syndrome (acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina), patients with a major depressive episode as well as patients with subthreshold depression symptoms {{are at increased risk}} for re-hospitalization for a major adverse cardiac event and mortality. This increased risk is independent of the presence of medical comorbidities, the severity of the CHD and known prognostic risk factors such as age, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, and independent of the intake of antidepressant medication. Of the two <b>core</b> <b>depression</b> symptoms, anhedonia (the loss of ability to experience pleasure), but not depressed mood (marked by sadness, tearfulness and distress), marks this increased prognostic risk. After an acute coronary syndrome, patients with depression are {{three times more likely to}} poorly adhere to cardioprotective medication than patients without depression, and this poorer adherence in part explains their increased prognostic risk. When depressive symptoms decrease, medication adherence increases subsequently, and vice versa, suggesting that interventions to improve medication adherence should take into account depression as a possible barrier. Several intervention studies have shown that depression can be effectively treated with pharmacotherapy in CHD patients. However, treatment effects of mono-therapeutic approaches are modest at best and have not resulted in improvements in patients’ cardiac prognosis. An “Enhanced Depression Care” approach, with a stepped treatment algorithm, close depression care supervision, and initial patient preference for problem-solving therapy and/or pharmacotherapy resulted in a significant improvement in satisfaction with care in both men and women, a greater reduction in depression symptoms than was achieved in previous intervention studies, and a significant reduction in major cardiac events across the intervention period. This approach awaits further evaluation in multicenter studies with larger sample sizes. Further research should assess the feasibility, acceptability, safety and cost-effectiveness of integrating collaborative models of depression care for CHD patients into existing health care services...|$|E

Here, we examined the regulation of BDNF expression in the hippocampus and amygdala of rats subjected to the chronic mild stress (CMS) model of depression, a paradigm that induces anhedonia, a <b>core</b> symptom of <b>depression.</b> We found that exposure of rats to the CMS paradigm did not modulate BDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus and amygdala. In addition, chronic administration of imipramine, which reversed CMS-induced anhedonia, did not alter BDNF mRNA expression in these limbic structures...|$|R
40|$|Background. This review {{aimed to}} address the {{question}} of whether cognitive impairment should be considered a <b>core</b> feature of <b>depression</b> that may be a valuable target for treatment. Method. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cognitive function, assessed with a single neuropsychological test battery, the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), in patients with depression during symptomatic and remitted states. Inclusion of studies comparing patients remitted from depression and controls enabled us to investigate whether cognitive impairment persists beyond episodes of low mood in depression. Results. Our meta-analysis revealed significant moderate cognitive deficits in executive function, memory and attention in patients with depression relative to controls (Cohen's d effect sizes ranging from - 0. 34 to - 0. 65). Significant moderate deficits in executive function and attention (Cohen's d ranging from - 0. 52 to - 0. 61) and non-significant small/moderate deficits in memory (Cohen's d ranging from - 0. 22 to - 0. 54) were found to persist in patients whose depressive symptoms had remitted, indicating that cognitive impairment occurs separately from episodes of low mood in depression. Conclusions. Both low mood and cognitive impairment are associated with poor psychosocial functioning. Therefore, we argue that remediation of cognitive impairment and alleviation of depressive symptoms each {{play an important role in}} improving outcome for patients with depression. In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that cognitive impairment represents a <b>core</b> feature of <b>depression</b> that cannot be considered an epiphenomenon that is entirely secondary to symptoms of low mood and that may be a valuable target for future interventions...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Background : Depression {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{disability}} and largest contributor to the global burden of disease. In sub-Saharan Africa, depression often goes undetected and untreated, in part, due to a lack of validated screening and diagnostic instruments. Therefore, we conducted a validation study of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 9) and fully structured Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) in diagnosing current major depressive disorder (MDD) among Ethiopian adults. Methods : A total of 926 adults attending outpatient departments in a major referral hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia participated in this study. We used a two stage-study design where participants were first interviewed using an Amharic versions of PHQ- 9 and the CIDI instruments and then a stratified random sample underwent a follow-up semi-structured clinical interview conducted by a psychiatrist, blinded to the screening results, using Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) instrument. We tested construct validity using factor analysis and by examining associations of PHQ- 9 /CIDI with self-reported quality of life as assessed using the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHO-QOL) Questionnaire. We calculated the psychometric properties of the PHQ- 9 /CIDI using the SCAN diagnostic interview as a gold standard. Results : Our study provided evidence for unidimensionality of <b>core</b> <b>depression</b> screening questions on both PHQ- 9 and CIDI interviews with good factor loadings on a major core depressive factor. The PHQ- 9 items showed good internal (Cronbach's alpha= 0. 85) and test re-test reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient= 0. 92). Similarly, we found that the CIDI diagnostic interview has good internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha= 0. 97) among Ethiopian adults. Quality of life, as reflected in subscale scores for four WHO-QOL domains, was significantly lower among adults classified as depressed on the PHQ- 9 and CIDI compared to those classified as not depressed. Receiver Operating Characteristics analysis showed that a PHQ- 9 threshold score of 9 offered the optimal discriminatory power with respect to diagnosis of major depressive disorder via the clinical interview (sensitivity= 79 % and specificity= 72 %). Compared to the SCAN reference standard, the CIDI had fair specificity (72. 2 %) but low sensitivity (51. 0 %). Conclusion : The PHQ- 9 is a reliable and valid instrument that may be used as a screen for major depressive disorder among Ethiopian adults in outpatient health care settings. The CIDI had fair specificity and low sensitivity in detecting MDD compared with psychiatrist administered SCAN diagnosis. Our findings are generally consistent with prior studies. Use of fully structured interviews such as the CIDI for MDD diagnosis in clinical settings might lead to under detection of MDD...|$|E
40|$|A nonhydrostatic cloud {{model is}} {{used to examine the}} thermomechanics of {{tropical}} cyclogenesis under realistic meteorological conditions. Observations motivate the focus on the problem of how a midtropo-spheric cyclonic vortex, a frequent by-product of mesoscale convective systems during summertime condi-tions over tropical oceans, may be transformed into a surface-concentrated (warm <b>core)</b> tropical <b>depression.</b> As a first step, the vortex transformation is studied in the absence of vertical wind shear or zonal flow. Within the cyclonic vorticity-rich environment of the mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) embryo, the simulations demonstrate that small-scale cumulonimbus towers possessing intense cyclonic vorticity in their cores [vortical hot towers (VHTs) ] emerge as the preferred coherent structures. The VHTs acquire their vertical vorticity through a combination of tilting of MCV horizontal vorticity and stretching of MCV and VHT-generated vertical vorticity. Horizontally localized and exhibiting convective lifetimes on the order of 1 h, VHTs overcome the generally adverse effects of downdrafts by consuming convective available po-tential energy in their local environment, humidifying the middle and upper troposphere, and undergoing diabatic vortex merger with neighboring towers. During metamorphosis, the VHTs vortically prime the mesoscale environment and collectively mimic...|$|R
40|$|NASA is {{preparing}} for the Tropical Cloud Systems and Processes (TCSP) field experiment in July 2005, a joint effort with NOAA to study tropical cloud systems and tropical cyclone genesis in the Eastern Pacific. A major thrust of the TCSP program is {{the improvement of the}} understanding and prediction of tropical cyclone genesis, intensity, motion, rainfall potential, and landfall impacts using remote sensing and in-situ data, as well as numerical modeling, particularly as they relate to the three phases of water. The Eastern Pacific has the highest frequency of genesis events per unit area of any region worldwide. African easterly waves, mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), and orographic effects are thought to play roles in the genesis of tropical cyclones there. The general consensus is that tropical depressions form in association with one or more mid-level, mesoscale cyclonic vortices that are generated within the stratiform region of the MCS precursors. To create the warm <b>core</b> tropical <b>depression</b> vortex, however, the midlevel cyclonic circulation must somehow extend down to the surface and the tangential winds must attain sufficient strength (- 10 m s-) to enable the wind-induced surface heat exchange to increase the potential energy of the boundary layer air...|$|R
30|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} current irritability to be both highly prevalent and indicative of worse illness severity in acute bipolar depression. Irritability is a <b>core</b> symptom of <b>depression</b> {{in children and adolescents}} (but not in adults) (American Psychiatric Association 2013), and is present in up to three quarters of depressed BD patients (Winokur et al. 1969). Current irritability has been associated with multiple unfavorable illness characteristics in bipolar depression, including earlier onset age and higher rates of suicidal ideation, axis I comorbidity, atypical depressive features, and depressive mixed states (Balázs et al. 2006; Benazzi and Akiskal 2005; Benazzi et al. 2004). Additionally, current irritability appears closely related to current anxiety and lifetime history of anxiety disorder in BD (Yuen et al. 2016).|$|R

40|$|Optical fibres and waveguides {{have become}} vital {{components}} in communication systems ranging from on-chip interconnects in datacentres, to trans-oceanic submarine communication cables. Typically, {{they are designed}} in a trial-and-error manner and {{the objective of this}} thesis was to investigate their inverse design using a method known as inverse-scattering. In contrast to methods of design optimisation where an initial refractive form of index profile of some kind must be chosen, inverse-scattering makes no such assumptions other than that of which modes are carried by the structure and what their respective propagation constants are. Initially, the control over group-velocity dispersion in a single-mode planar waveguide with fixed propagation constant was investigated by considering the form of the transverse reflection response by which the modal properties of the waveguide may be specified, as discussed in the literature. It was demonstrated that common features of dispersion-engineered waveguides were obtained corroborating their use in the existing literature and further understanding of these features was developed. Extending the study to multimode planar waveguides through the application of an inverse-scattering method rooted in the quantum mechanical community, the properties of multiple guided modes, such as their group-velocities and modal gain were controlled. The realisation that both gain and loss are required in a refractive index profile to have exact equalisation of modal gain across multiple modes was novel and differed from existing approaches using genetic algorithms. In addition to this, the design of waveguide couplers by which power can be transferred from one waveguide to another was considered by an approach differing from that of the increasingly popular supersymmetric (SUSY) approach in the literature. Attention turned to the design of few-mode optical fibres which are at the forefront of technology. Since the planar waveguide designs above were found to contain ‘depressions’ and ‘rings’, similar such features were investigated in an optical fibre based upon the knowledge that there were similarities in the modal intensity profiles of the first few linearly polarised (LP) modes in a fibre, and that of the TE modes in planar waveguides. <b>Core</b> <b>depressions</b> and ‘rod-like’ refractive index perturbations were implemented and found to increase the spacing between mode groups. Following on from the above successes, inverse-scattering techniques were applied directly to the cylindrical symmetry of optical fibres and their associated LP modes. A particular feature of this work was the realisation that the propagation constants of such modes can only be specified {{at the start of the}} design process for a fixed value of the azimuthal symmetry of the fibre mode. A finding by other researchers using the SUSY technique had been that the modes in coupled fibres (trunk-partner pairs) could only be ‘matched’ when the azimuthal symmetry of the trunk and partner modes differed. The inverse-scattering method in this thesis, on the other hand, does not have this limitation...|$|R
