5|$|Although {{supplies}} {{had been}} left in Aladdin's Cave—including fresh fruit—there were not the spare <b>crampons</b> he had expected. Without them he could not hope to descend the steep ice slope to the hut, and so he began to fashion his own, collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases. Even when completed, a blizzard confined him to the cave, and only on 8 February was he able to begin the descent. Nearing the hut, he was spotted by three men working outside, who rushed {{up the hill to}} meet him.|$|E
5|$|Striding Edge is {{a notorious}} {{accident}} spot among hikers and scramblers. In winter conditions the climb from Striding Edge {{up to the}} summit plateau can involve crossing steep icy ground and a snow cornice, and {{can be the most}} dangerous part of the walk. Without an ice axe or <b>crampons</b> this presents a serious obstacle. In January 2008 two walkers died after falling from the ridge in separate incidents. Another walker died after falling from Striding Edge in May 2008.|$|E
5|$|This trek was {{the first}} {{recorded}} crossing of the mountainous island, completed without tents, sleeping bags, or map—their only mountaineering equipment was a carpenter's adze, a length of alpine rope, and screws from the James Caird hammered through their boots to serve as <b>crampons.</b> They arrived at the whaling station at Stromness, tired and dirty, hair long and matted, faces blackened by months of cooking by blubber stoves—"the world's dirtiest men", according to Worsley. They quickly organized a boat {{to pick up the}} three {{on the other side of}} South Georgia, but thereafter it took Shackleton three months and four attempts by ship to rescue the other 22men still on Elephant Island.|$|E

5|$|Each year, {{thousands}} of outdoor enthusiasts attempt to summit Mount Adams. The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription {{on a rock}} at Piker’s Peak indicates. “You are a piker {{if you think this}} is the summit. Don’t crab, the mountain was here first.” <b>Crampons</b> and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route’s steepness. Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of the north and west sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous {{for a variety of reasons}} and people have died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} the three guides came back, {{traversing}} the face from a hole near the Eigerwand station and risking their lives under incessant avalanches. Toni Kurz was still alive but almost helpless, {{with one hand and}} one arm completely frozen. Kurz hauled himself off the cliff after cutting loose the rope that bound him to his dead teammate below and climbed back onto the face. The guides were not able to pass an unclimbable overhang that separated them from Kurz. They managed to give him a rope long enough to reach them by tying two ropes together. While descending, Kurz could not get the knot to pass through his carabiner. He tried for hours to reach his rescuers who were only a few metres below him. Then he began to lose consciousness. One of the guides, climbing on another's shoulders, was able to touch the tip of Kurz's <b>crampons</b> with his ice-axe but could not reach higher. Kurz was unable to descend further and, completely exhausted, died slowly.|$|E
25|$|The four-hour {{round trip}} to the summit and back via one of the shorter trails is {{considered}} moderately challenging for the average hiker but requires no technical skills during the late spring to early fall season. Wind and weather on the exposed, rocky summit is usually harsher than below, year round; winter storms and summer thunderstorms can be life-threatening. Winter snow and ice can linger on the trails well into May, making hiking hazardous or impossible without special equipment. The compacting of snow due to winter recreation on the more frequently used trails tends to lengthen {{the time it takes}} for the snow and ice to melt off. Stabilizers, <b>crampons,</b> ice axes, ski poles, and snowshoes may be helpful or necessary for winter and early spring ascents depending on ice and snow cover. Fall hiking generally requires warmer clothing, an awareness of weather conditions, and earlier ascent times. As there are few reliable water sources on the mountain and little shelter from the sun above , dehydration and heat stroke are potential hiking hazards. Poison ivy does not grow on Mount Monadnock, and venomous snakes do not inhabit it. The mountain and surrounding area are black bear habitat, although problem encounters with bears are rare.|$|E

25|$|One {{of the big}} {{activities}} is trips to base camp (aka trekking), which can be higher {{than some of the}} highest mountains. The other big activity is serious attempts {{to make it to the}} top of Everest, and those in support of those attempts. The peak time for this is late May, because that is when the monsoons push the jet stream away, there is another time later in the year when the monsoon ends yielding another break in the weather, but there is more snow then. Some technology for climbing include <b>crampons,</b> fixed ropes, various cold-weather gear, bottled oxygen, and weather prediction. Predicting the weather is critical, one of the big disasters came in 1996 when a storm hit during a summit bid. In modern times, there is greater on-demand logistical support available such as internet access, but also some new challenges like not offending the locals and watching out for oxygen-bottle thefts. Helicopter support has grown and the availability of helicopter rescues increased, but there are limits on how high and in what weather they are able to fly. Modern dangers remain unexpected avalanches (this claimed many in 2014 and 2015), sudden onset of altitude sickness, and that classic climbing danger- falling. For a price, permits are available from China in the Tibet region and from Nepal and there is a multitude of mountaineering firms world over operating on the mountain.|$|E

500|$|When {{war with}} Mexico seemed imminent, {{topographic}} engineers {{were sent to}} the border to assist with the army's preparations. Raynolds served in Winfield Scott's Mexican-American War campaign which marched overland to Mexico City from the Gulf of Mexico seaport at Veracruz.

Raynolds's party is credited with being the first confirmed to climb to the summit of Pico de Orizaba (...) which at [...] is the tallest mountain in Mexico and third tallest in North America. Over a period of several months, Raynolds and other officers from both the army and navy mapped the best approach route to Pico de Orizaba. To assist them in their climb, the party planned on taking grapnels attached to long ropes and primitive <b>crampons</b> in the form of shoes with projecting points to help ensure they could safely climb up cliffs and across glaciers. Told by local villagers that any attempt to reach the summit would be fruitless because no one had ever done it before, the Americans became even more determined to show the Mexicans it could be climbed.|$|E

Cotton clothing retains moisture and chills the body, both particularly dangerous in cold weather. [...] Winter backpackers stick to wool or synthetic fabric like nylon or polypropylene, which hold less moisture and often have specialized wicking properties to dissipate sweat generated during aerobic activities.
