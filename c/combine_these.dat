The goal of the Nord Stage was to <b>combine</b> <b>these</b> two technologies together into a flagship instrument.|$|E
5|$|The fungal {{cell wall}} is {{composed}} of glucans and chitin; while glucans are also found in plants and chitin in the exoskeleton of arthropods, fungi are the only organisms that <b>combine</b> <b>these</b> two structural molecules in their cell wall. Unlike those of plants and oomycetes, fungal cell walls do not contain cellulose.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses <b>combine</b> <b>these</b> soaring {{techniques}} {{with the}} use of predictable weather systems: albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|E

5|$|New South Wales and Victoria {{had signed}} an {{agreement}} towards constructing bridges for railways over the Murray to serve the settlements on the northern side. In 1923, a report was released that recommended going ahead with the building of four bridges, one of those being the future Abbotsford Bridge. It was said a bridge in this area would benefit Curlwaa, Wentworth, and a proposed irrigation scheme to the north. The cost was estimated at £78,000. It had been considered {{that it might be}} appropriate to <b>combine</b> <b>these</b> four bridges with locks, but this idea was rejected due to siting concerns.|$|E
5|$|SS Great Britain is {{a museum}} ship and former {{passenger}} steamship, which was advanced for her time. She {{was the longest}} passenger ship in the world from 1845 to 1854. She was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel for the Great Western Steamship Company's transatlantic service between Bristol and New York. While other ships had been built of iron or equipped with a screw propeller, Great Britain {{was the first to}} <b>combine</b> <b>these</b> features in a large ocean-going ship. She was the first iron steamer to cross the Atlantic, which she did in 1845, in the time of 14 days.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Aristotle {{observed}} that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which <b>combine.</b> <b>These</b> seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information. Aristotle makes clear that he sometimes intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a woodcarving. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); the tools and carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its eidos or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.|$|E

25|$|Methyl {{isocyanate}} {{is usually}} manufactured by {{the reaction of}} monomethylamine and phosgene. For large scale production, it is advantageous to <b>combine</b> <b>these</b> reactants at higher temperature in the gas phase. A mixture of methyl isocyanate and two moles of hydrogen chloride is formed, but N-methylcarbamoyl chloride (MCC) forms as the mixture is condensed, leaving one mole of hydrogen chloride as a gas.|$|E

25|$|As we {{can apply}} the same process for {{determining}} if M prints 1 infinitely often. When we <b>combine</b> <b>these</b> processes, we can determine that M does, or does not, go on printing 1’s and 0’s ad infinitum. Thus we have a method for determining if M is circle-free. By Proof 1 this is impossible. So the first assertion that E exists, is wrong: E does not exist.|$|E
25|$|As {{explained}} in the trapping section, if met by resistance, hornets lose the urge to attack and instead retreat. Different measures of resistance include weeds, wire, or fishing nets or limiting the passage size so only bees can make it through. Experienced hornets catch on and eventually stay on these traps, awaiting the arrival of bees. The best method of controlling hornets is to <b>combine</b> <b>these</b> protective screens with traps.|$|E
25|$|Fabrication of nano-channels is {{categorized}} into top-down and bottom-up methods.

25|$|The {{key idea}} of {{tabulation}} hashing is {{to view a}} key as a vector of t r-bit numbers, use a lookup table filled with random values to compute a hash value {{for each of the}} r-bit numbers representing a given key, and <b>combine</b> <b>these</b> values with the bitwise binary exclusive or operation.

25|$|Music for {{parade and}} show bands is {{typically}} learned separately, in a concert band setting. It {{may even be}} memorized before any of the marching steps are learned. When rehearsing drill, positions and maneuvers are usually learned without playing the music simultaneously—a common technique for learning drill is to have members sing their parts or march to a recording produced during a music rehearsal. Many bands learn drill one picture or form at a time, and later <b>combine</b> <b>these</b> and add music.|$|E
