5|$|From {{the very}} beginning, {{from the first}} moment I may almost say, of my {{acquaintance}} with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I had not known you a month before I felt {{that you were the}} last man in the world whom I <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> prevailed on to marry.|$|E
5|$|Pedro Afonso's {{death from}} fever {{at the age}} of one devastated the Emperor, and the {{imperial}} couple had no further children. Pedro Afonso's older sister Dona Isabel became heiress, but PedroII was unconvinced that a woman <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> accepted as monarch by the ruling elite. He excluded Isabel from matters of state and failed to provide training for her possible role as empress. With no surviving male children, the Emperor started to believe that the imperial line was destined to end with his own death.|$|E
5|$|That {{shot was}} totally and {{completely}} inspired by 'Something's Got to Give,' Marilyn Monroe's last movie that never got finished. It's {{an homage to}} her, because I've never seen anyone re-create it. So many people have emulated so many of Marilyn's classic moments, but it's just that I'm {{a big fan of}} hers, and I thought it was really pretty at night with the pool. No one <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> as fabulous as Marilyn was, but it's in honor and homage to her.|$|E

5|$|Criticisms of Keynes's ideas {{had begun}} to gain {{significant}} acceptance by the early 1970s, as they were then {{able to make a}} credible case that Keynesian models no longer reflected economic reality. Keynes himself included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his General Theory. For economists such as Hyman Minsky, Keynes's limited use of mathematics was partly the result of his scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> adequately captured by mathematical models. Nevertheless, many models were developed by Keynesian economists, with a famous example being the Phillips curve which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. It implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation. In 1968 Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Philips curve did not exist.|$|E
5|$|Anne, however, {{expected}} {{kindness and}} compassion from her closest friend. Sarah was not forthcoming {{in this regard}} and frequently overpowered and dominated Anne. One major political disagreement occurred when Sarah insisted that her son-in-law, Charles Spencer, the third Earl of Sunderland, be admitted into the Privy Council. Sarah allied herself more strongly with the Whigs, who supported the Duke of Marlborough in the war; and the Whigs hoped to utilise Sarah's position as royal favourite. Anne refused to appoint Sunderland: she disliked the radical Whigs, whom she saw {{as a threat to}} her royal prerogative. Sarah used her close friendship with the Earl of Godolphin, whom Anne trusted, to eventually secure such appointments, but continued to lobby Anne herself. She sent Whig reading materials to Anne in an attempt to win her over to her own preferred political party. In 1704, Anne confided to Lord Godolphin that she did not think she and Sarah <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> true friends again.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Others, the Simpson family find unexplained frosty {{chocolate}} milkshakes and that their TV only shows Married... with Children. After a ghost attacks him in his sleep, Homer summons the ghosts, who are the family's former selves from The Tracey Ullman Show. Homer is attracted to the ghost Marge who prefers him to the former grumpy Homer, so the jealous living Marge kills herself to become a ghost. The ghost Homer becomes jealous and bludgeons the living Homer {{to death with a}} toaster while he is in the bathtub. Bart fakes suicide to join the ghosts, tricking Lisa into actually killing herself, her ghost then murders Bart as revenge. Groundskeeper Willie takes the children's corpses to make stew and it is implied that he murdered Maggie. Homer chooses his modern-day wife over the older ghost. The next morning at the breakfast table, Lisa asks if there <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> any other incarnations of the Simpsons and a range of Simpson families based on other animations are then shown. The segment ends with the original version of Homer unsuccessfully trying to photograph a good portrait of the two families together.|$|E

25|$|When Superman's {{identity}} is exposed {{as part of}} Vandal Savage's plot to drain his powers, Superman consults Luthor for help, but Luthor expresses disbelief {{at the idea that}} Superman <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> someone like Clark Kent, going along with Superman's request for help just to find out the 'real' plan.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with what}} had gone before and what {{followed}} it was a small, low-cost affair. The approach was from {{the north side of}} the mountain and the climbing was planned to be after the monsoon. The monsoon was unusually late that year and, beset by the weather and in difficult conditions of snow, little was achieved regarding the summit. However, a very large number of lesser peaks were climbed for the first time and a southern route up the Western Cwm was identified as a possible line of approach if Nepal <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> persuaded to change its policy of not admitting climbers.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} this {{approach}} {{was that it was}} very difficult to focus the electron guns on the ridges without the signal bleeding over to the ridges on either side. This problem was compounded by the changing angle between the gun and the ridges as the signal progressed down the screen. Similar designs were attempted by a number of researchers, the best known being the Geer tube that used pyramid-shaped patterns with three guns arranged around the back. None of these systems <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> made to work reliably, with focussing and alignment being continual problems. There is no documentary evidence that a successful version of the three-gun Telechrome tube was ever built, although images of Baird holding a prototype are widely duplicated. The prototype that usually appears is the two-gun tube. The two-gun tube actually had three necks. For this reason, people often mistake this tube for a three-gun prototype. In fact, the third neck is the original neck from the Hewittic envelope. This third neck holds not a gun, but instead, supports for the two-sided target. Burns published a typical photo of the two-gun, three-neck tube.|$|E
50|$|The Intiorko plateau is an arid and soft-sloped terrain {{located a}} few miles north from Tacna, {{becoming}} an excellent shooting ground. It has on the rear a series of little sand undulations that allowed the concealment of reserve units behind them. The flanks are protected by the Sama-Tacna road from the east, and to the west by an almost impossible to walk terrain, where no artillery <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> placed, and a harsh field for infantry or cavalry movement.|$|R

500|$|The machine's {{successful}} {{operation was}} widely {{reported in the}} British press, which used the phrase [...] "electronic brain" [...] in describing it to their readers. That description provoked a reaction {{from the head of}} the University of Manchester's Department of Neurosurgery, the start of a long-running debate as to whether an electronic computer <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> truly creative.|$|E
500|$|Following the 1933 {{transfer}} of the Metropolitan Railway to public ownership to become the Metropolitan line of London Transport, Westcott station {{became a part of}} the London Underground, despite being over [...] from central London. The management of London Transport believed it very unlikely that the line <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> made viable, and Westcott station was closed, {{along with the rest of}} the line, from 30 November 1935. The station building and its associated house are the only significant buildings from the Brill Tramway to survive other than the former junction station at Quainton Road.|$|E
25|$|But {{this local}} {{community}} pressure {{also had the}} positive effect of forcing Winfield's residents to work together more closely, and form a more tightly knit community than <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> have <b>been</b> anticipated in the original site plan.|$|R
6000|$|It was the woman's feebleness that irritated her. If {{only she}} had shown {{a spark of}} fight, Joan could have been firm. Poor feckless creature, what <b>could</b> have <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> her {{attraction}} for Phillips! ...|$|R
6000|$|With {{eyes and}} mouth closed like that, and all {{alabaster}} white, the face was perfect, purged of its little commonnesses. Strange freak that this white flower of a face <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> have <b>been</b> produced by Mr. and Mrs. Wagge! ...|$|R
500|$|In 1846, Willis settled {{near the}} banks of Canterbury Creek near the Hudson River in New York and named his new home Idlewild. When Willis first visited the property, the owners said it had little value {{and that it was}} [...] "an idle wild of which nothing <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> made". He built a fourteen-room [...] "cottage", as he called it, {{at the edge of a}} plateau by Moodna Creek next to a sudden [...] drop into a gorge. Willis worked closely with the architect, Calvert Vaux, to {{carefully}} plan each gable and piazza to fully take advantage of the dramatic view of the river and mountains.|$|E
500|$|In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway {{was taken}} into public {{ownership}} and became the Metropolitan line of London Transport. As a result, Wood Siding became a station on the London Underground network, despite being over [...] from the City of London. London Transport's new management aimed {{to move away from}} goods services to concentrate on passenger services. As the line served a very lightly populated rural area, the new management believed it very unlikely that it <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> made viable. Wood Siding was closed, {{along with the rest of}} the line, from 30 November 1935. All infrastructure associated with the station was removed in 1936; the remains of the bridge which supported the station are still in place.|$|E
500|$|After the unveiling, a {{vigorous}} debate {{occurred in the}} British newspapers about the memorial. The Times was critical, comparing it unfavourably to the Cenotaph, while The Daily Mail highlighted {{the cost of the}} monument, and argued that the money could have been better spent on directly caring for injured veterans. Both the dead soldier and the howitzer drew particular comment; art critic Selwyn Image complained about having any sort of artillery gun on the monument, whilst Lord Curzon was quoted as describing the howitzer as [...] "a toad squatting, which is about to spit fire out of its mouth...nothing more hideous <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> conceived". Modernists, such as Roger Fry, criticised the conventional, secure structure that underpins the memorial.|$|E
6000|$|The present {{stone wall}} is not near the summit, and is of {{comparatively}} [...] recent date. It {{is difficult to}} believe from {{the slope of the}} outcrop [...] of rock that a wall <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> have <b>been</b> at the summit.|$|R
60|$|I {{went into}} the cellar; all the barrels were gone, and of the bottles a most {{surprising}} number had been drunk out and thrown away. Certainly, since the mutiny began, not a man of them <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> have <b>been</b> sober.|$|R
60|$|Her {{first words}} were enough. I {{wondered}} how I <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> have <b>been</b> in doubt. I knew the voice now. It was one which I {{had not heard}} for five years, but one which I could never forget if I lived for ever.|$|R
500|$|Lansbury {{found little}} support in his fight for women's {{suffrage}} from [...] his parliamentary Labour colleagues, whom he dismissed as [...] "a weak, flabby lot". In parliament, he denounced the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, for the cruelties being inflicted on imprisoned suffragists: [...] "You are beneath contempt... {{you ought to}} be driven from public life". He was temporarily suspended from the House for [...] "disorderly conduct". In October 1912, aware of the unbridgeable gap between his own position and that of his Labour colleagues, Lansbury resigned his [...] seat to fight a by-election in Bow and Bromley on the specific issue of women's suffrage. [...] He [...] lost to his Conservative opponent, who [...] campaigned on the slogan [...] "No Petticoat Government". Commenting on the result, the Labour MP Will Thorne opined that no constituency <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> won on the single question of votes for women.|$|E
500|$|The CTW hired Harvard University {{professor}} Gerald S. Lesser {{to design}} the show's educational objectives and establish and lead a National Board of Advisers. [...] Instead of providing what Lesser called [...] "window dressing", the Board actively participated {{in the construction of}} educational goals and creative methods. [...] At the Board's direction, Lesser conducted five three-day curriculum planning seminars in Boston and New York City in summer 1968. [...] The purpose of the seminars was to ascertain which school-preparation skills to emphasize in the new show. [...] The producers gathered professionals with diverse backgrounds to obtain ideas for educational content. [...] They reported that the seminars were [...] "widely successful", and resulted in long and detailed lists of possible topics for inclusion in the Sesame Street curriculum; in fact, the seminars produced more suggested educational objectives than <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> addressed by one television series.|$|E
500|$|Warren {{rejects the}} label [...] "video nasty", {{which has been}} applied to Inseminoid on the {{incorrect}} assumption that its violent content made it impossible to release uncut on home video formats in the UK. The film was incorrectly labelled as previously banned in 1984 when it was rereleased in its cut cinema print in 1994 by Vipco. It has long been uncut in the UK on DVD. In response to the idea that the film has attained cult status, he remarks, [...] "if Inseminoid has become some form of cult movie, then I am very pleased and, indeed, very flattered." [...] On his private response to his work, he answers that [...] "I don't think you <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> one hundred percent satisfied with any film you make", and that, in the scenario of remaking Inseminoid, he would darken the lighting of certain scenes to heighten the tension and demand a longer filming schedule.|$|E
