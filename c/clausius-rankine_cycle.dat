30|$|According to Kolin et al. (2000) when {{compared}} to the classic <b>Clausius–Rankine</b> <b>cycle,</b> mostly used in the present geothermal plants, Stirling cycle offers many theoretical and practical advantages. From thermodynamic point of view, Stirling cycle is equivalent to the optimal Carnot cycle, having the highest possible efficiency. The thermodynamic Stirling motor model follows the indications of Lloyd (2009).|$|E

40|$|The {{suitability}} of the low-temperature cycle of a vapour power-plant {{based on an}} organic fluid for cooling technical equipment that requires cooling during operation, e. g. power transformers, has been presented. The stream of the intermediate fluid, usually oil, which removes heat from the equipment being cooled is the upper heat reservoir of a power plant based on the <b>Clausius-Rankine</b> <b>cycle.</b> The byproduct of the operation of such an installation is electricity, {{which can be used}} to drive the fan cooling tower of the power plant. The assumed working parameters of the cycle, and mainly the criteria for selecting the organic working-fluid, whose properties {{have a major impact on}} the operating effectiveness of the solution, are proposed.

40|$|In {{the paper}} {{presented}} {{have been the}} results of the analysis of effectiveness of operation of binary power plant consisting of combined two <b>Clausius-Rankine</b> <b>cycles,</b> namely the binary cycle with water as a working fluid in the upper cycle and organic substance as a working fluid in the lower cycle, as well as a single fluid component power plant operating also in line with the C-R cycle for superheated steam, with water as a working fluid. The influence of the parameters of superheated steam in the upper cycle has been assessed as well as the type of working fluid in the lower cycle. The results of calculations have been referred to the single-cycle classical steam power plant operating at the same parameters of superheated steam and the same mass flow rate of water circulating in both cycles. On the basis of accomplished analysis {{it has been shown that}} the binary power plant shows a greater power with respect to the reference power plant...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDecreasing water {{resources}} and steadily rising water demand drive research towards new approaches for {{safe and reliable}} water supply for the municipal, agricultural and industrial sectors. One solution for fresh water provision is sea water desalination using solar thermal energy. This paper describes the coupling of a Multi Effect Distillation (MED) plant with a <b>Clausius-Rankine</b> <b>cycle</b> powered by a solar central receiver system. A steady state model of an MED plant is developed and a correlation for the Gained Output Ratio (GOR) as function of heating steam temperature, specific seawater massflow and specific heat transfer surface of the desalination plant is deduced. This correlation is integrated into {{a model of a}} central receiver plant, comprising the heliostat field, a molten salt receiver system, two-tank storage and the steam cycle.

40|$|The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) {{is a very}} {{promising}} process for the conversion of low or medium temperature heat to electricity in small and micro scale biomass powered systems. Classic ORC is analogous to <b>Clausius–Rankine</b> <b>cycle</b> in a steam power plant, but instead of water it uses low boiling, organic working fluids. Seeking energy and economical optimization of biomass-based ORC systems, we have proposed some modifications e. g. in low boiling fluid circuit construction. Due {{to the fact that}} the operation of a micro steam turbine is rather inefficient from the technical and economic point of view, a specially modified air compressor can be used as a steam piston engine. Such engine should be designed to work at low pressure of the working medium. Studies regarding the first version of the prototype installation were focused on the confirmation of applicability of a straw boiler in the prototype ORC power system. The results of the previous studies and the studies described in the paper (on the new cogeneration unit) confirmed the high potential of the developed solution. Of course, many further studies have to be carried out...|$|E
40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors William A. Beckman and John W. Mitchell; 163 pp. A solar electric generating system (SEGS) {{can be divided into}} two major subsystems (Lippke, 1995) : a solar collector field and a conventional <b>Clausius-Rankine</b> <b>cycle</b> with a turbine-generator. For the 30 MWe SEGS VI Parabolic Trough Collector Plant, one task of a skilled plant operator is to maintain a specified set point of the collector outlet temperature by adjusting the volume flow rate of the heat transfer fluid circulating through the collectors. The collector outlet temperature is mainly affected by changes in the sun intensity, by the collector inlet temperature and by the volume flow rate of the heat transfer fluid. For the development of next generation SEGS plants and in order to obtain a control algorithm that approximates an operator's behaviour, a linear model predictive controller is developed for use in a plant model. The plant model, which is discussed first in this work, consists of a model for the parabolic trough collector field and a model for the power plant. The plant model's usefulness is evaluated through a comparison between predicted and measured data. The performance of the controller is evaluated on four different days in 1998. The influence of the control on the gross output of the plant is examined as well.
