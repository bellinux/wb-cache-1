The detector parameters were sparsely optimized {{to imitate the}} usage that can be expected from personnel with limited experience. The transfer of the efficiency from the calibration geometry (60 ml, density 1. 0 g/cm(3)) to 200 ml geometry (density 1. 5 g/cm(3)) failed with all codes, which was discouraging. However, {{a majority of the}} other corrected activities deviated with less than 10 % from the reference activity values, even for density corrections or when corrections had been calculated for new source-detector-geometries. Smaller deviations, around 5 % or less, were achieved when corrections were done within the calibrated geometry.

Neutron-activated materials are calculated with <b>calculation</b> <b>codes</b> and their validity should be verified with measurements. The evaluation of neutron-activated materials can be divided into two processes. One is a distribution calculation of neutron-flux. Another is an activation calculation of materials.
