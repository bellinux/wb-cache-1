40|$|In recent years, {{more and}} more fonts have been {{implemented}} in the digital publishing industry and in reading devices. In this thesis, {{we focus on the}} methods of evaluating digital Chinese fonts and their typeface characteristics. Our goal is to seek a good way to enhance the legibility and readability of Chinese <b>characters</b> <b>displayed</b> on digital <b>devices</b> such as cell phones, tablets and e-book devices. To accomplish this goal, we have combined methods in data mining, and pattern recognition with psychological and statistical analyses. Our research involved an extensive survey of the distinctive features of eighteen popular Chinese digital typefaces. Survey results were tabulated and analyzed statistically. Then, two objective experiments were conducted, using the best six fonts derived from the survey results. These experimental results have revealed an effective way of choosing legible and readable Chinese digital fonts that are most suitable for the comfortable reading of books, magazines, newspapers, and for the display of texts on cell-phones, e-books, and digital libraries. Results also helped us find out the features for improving character legibility and readability of different Chinese typefaces. The relationships among legibility, readability, eye-strain, and myopia, will be discussed. Moreover, digital market requirements and analyses will be provided...|$|R

Abstract A large area perfect aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) thin film was grown directly on a stainless steel substrates by a low cost bias-assisted hot-filament chemical-vapor deposition (BA HF-CVD) technology. The CNT’s / stainless steel field emission array (FEA) cathode (CNT’s/FEA) has been fabricated. The field electron emission behavior of the CNT’s/FEA cathode was characterized in a vacuum condition, a high electron emission of about 10 mA/cm 2 at a low electric field of 4 V/μm implies the promising the application as a cathode of the flat panel <b>display</b> <b>device,</b> so further assembled this cathode {{in a kind of}} vacuum device, and the possibility of the operation from a flat panel <b>character</b> (Pictures) <b>display</b> tube FCT has been tested initially. 1...|$|R

30|$|As the {{technology}} of <b>display</b> <b>devices</b> is developed, various high-performance <b>display</b> <b>devices</b> have become available to users in the market. While several current video coding and transmission specifications have been defined for relatively old devices having HD spatial resolution and a temporal rate of 30 fps, spatial and temporal resolutions of many commercial <b>display</b> <b>devices</b> have become higher[1]. Furthermore, they have the functionality to enhance spatial and temporal resolution during post-processing.
