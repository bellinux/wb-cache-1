In analyzing cash flow response coefficient determinants, net income and the accounting rate of return are used as benchmarks for comparison with three cash flow earnings measures, <b>cash</b> flow from <b>operations,</b> <b>cash</b> recoveries, and the cash recovery rate. ^ Results indicate that economic growth is a cross-sectional determinant and the risk-free interest rate is an intertemporal determinant with net income as the earnings measure and to a lesser degree with <b>cash</b> flow from <b>operations</b> and <b>cash</b> recoveries as earnings measures. Tests for systematic risk and persistence as response coefficient determinants do not produce results consistent with the predicted signs with cash flow earnings measures nor with Collins and Kothari 2 ̆ 7 s previous results using net income as the earnings measure.
