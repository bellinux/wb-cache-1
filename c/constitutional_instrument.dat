The Court of Appeal's focus on the suggestion that residents have an entitlement or right to representation rather than on the purpose behind the statute has been described as embracing the Fisher approach and as a departure from the interpretive approach to constitutional interpretation espoused in section 9A of the Interpretation Act read with Article 2(9) of the Constitution. Section 9A requires a purposive approach to be taken when interpreting laws, and states that an interpretation of a law that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object. Article 2(9) states: [...] "Subject to this Article, the Interpretation Act (Cap. 1) shall apply for the purpose of interpreting this Constitution and otherwise in relation thereto as it applies for the purpose of interpreting and otherwise in relation to any written law within the meaning of that Act".|$|E

5000|$|Unlike the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, {{which was}} added to the Constitution of Canada in 1982, the Bill of Rights is not a <b>constitutional</b> <b>instrument</b> but rather an {{ordinary}} statute. Still, the Canadian Bill of Rights remains in effect, and its guarantee of the [...] "determination" [...] of one's [...] "rights and obligations" [...] through fundamental justice is not precisely duplicated in the Charter. While the term [...] "fundamental justice" [...] does appear in section 7 of the Charter, this is to limit the rights to life, liberty and security of the person. Hence, in the 1985 Supreme Court of Canada case Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, half of the Court found section 2(e) of the Bill of Rights still has a role to play in Canadian law, and they used it to find in favour of the rights claimants. Justice Jean Beetz, writing for this half of the Court, noted that section 26 of the Charter states that rights outside the Charter are not invalid, and hence the Bill of Rights still has a role to play in Canadian law. Beetz went on to find that in this case, refugees had been denied hearings, and thus their section 2(e) and fundamental justice rights were infringed. (The other half of the Court also found in favour of the claimants, but relied instead on section 7 of the Charter).|$|E
40|$|Appointment {{powers of}} the President of the Republic under the Constitution of the CR and its {{comparison}} with the <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Instrument</b> of 1920 Abstract The purpose of this thesis is to analyze and summarize appointment {{powers of the}} President of the Republic under the Constitution of the Czech Republic and compare them with the appointment powers of the President under the <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Instrument</b> of 1920.

Second is handling responsibilities of the president and counter-signature. Second chapter describes common appointment powers which occur in both Constitutions. It is divided into four subchapters.

40|$|Hong Kong, {{formerly}} a British colony and since 1997 a Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) under the constitutional formula of ‘One Country, Two Systems’, has a judicial {{system that is}} much more highly evaluated, trusted and respected internationally and locally than its counterpart in mainland China. The normative ideals of the Rule of Law and judicial independence were implanted on Hong Kong soil during the colonial era. Such ideals have remained alive and well, and more cherished and vigorously defended than ever before, after Hong Kong was re-unified with China in 1997. Under the Hong Kong Basic Law – the HKSAR’s <b>constitutional</b> <b>instrument</b> that was enacted by the PRC’s National People’s Congress in 1990 and came into effect in 1997 – Hong Kong enjoys {{a high degree of}} autonomy, and its pre-existing legal and judicial systems have largely remained intact, except, for instance, that a new Court of Final Appeal was established, which exercises the power of final adjudication in Hong Kong cases. This paper provides an overview of the Hong Kong Judiciary, particularly those aspects of the judicial system that are relevant to the independence, impartiality and integrity of the courts and their judges. The paper consists of the following sections: (1) the structure of the judicial system; (2) judicial features of ‘One Country, Two Systems’; (3) appointment and conditions of service of judges; (4) rules of bias and recusal; (5) contempt of court by ‘scandalising the court’; (6) judges and free speech; (7) judges and non-judicial functions.

In this context, the importance of ethnicity and identity, in which discourses transformed views of an indigenous consciousness, can be seen in their political demands...|$|R
40|$|This book {{analyses}} {{the concept}} {{of the rule of law}} in the context of international law, through the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. It investigates how the court has defined and interpreted the notion of the rule of law in its jurisprudence. It places this analysis against a background of more theoretical accounts of the idea of the rule of law, drawing in ideas of political philosophy. It also provides a comparative assessment, demonstrating how the idea of the rule of law has evolved in the UK, France, and Germany. The book argues that at the core of {{the concept of}} the rule of law are the notions of legality and judicial safeguards. It states that the Court has developed the requirements of legality, which the work analyses in detail, based on that concept. It assesses the independence of the judiciary as an aspect of the rule of law in the context of the European Convention on Human Rights, and the relationship between the rule of law and the substantive contents of law. The book posits that the rule of law as seen at the Court is not mainly utilised with regard to ‘freedom’ rights, but is more concerned with procedural rights. It discusses the relationship between the rule of law and the view of the Convention as a <b>constitutional</b> <b>instrument</b> of the European public order, and shows that the rule of law and democracy are inextricably linked in the case law of the Court. Ultimately, the book demonstrates in its analysis of the Court’s jurisprudence that the notion of the rule of law is a crucial part of the international legal order...|$|E
40|$|In July 1997, the British {{colony of}} Hong Kong was {{returned}} to the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). It became a Special Administrative Region (“SAR”) of the PRC {{in accordance with the}} concept of “one country, two systems” embodied by the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984. The <b>constitutional</b> <b>instrument</b> of Hong Kong’s new legal and political system is the Basic Law of the SAR of Hong Kong, enacted by the National People’s Congress of the PRC and effective as of July 1997. Under colonial rule, Hong Kong inherited a British-style legal system. English common law formed the foundation, and the British tradition of the Rule of law and the independence of the judiciary were transplanted to Hong Kong. In the post-War era, the people of Hong Kong enjoyed relatively more civil liberties than did the people of mainland China and Taiwan. Since the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, the legal system of Hong Kong was further liberalized, and the political system partially democratized. Following the Tiananmen massacre of 1989, the British colonial government introduced into Hong Kong’s constitution a Bill of Rights for the purpose of boosting residents’ confidence in Hong Kong’s future. Since the enactment of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights, the courts of Hong Kong have developed a solid body of case law on the protection of human rights, and have begun to exercise the power of judicial review of legislation. The era of constitutional adjudication thus began in Hong Kong. After the establishment of the SAR of Hong Kong in 1997, the judiciary faced dual challenges of finding a place in the new constitutional order of “one country, two systems” and leading Hong Kong forward in its legal and constitutional development. Delicate issues of Hong Kong’s constitutional relationship with the central government in Beijing have arisen, which often underscore the contradiction between the Communist Party-led legal system in mainland China and the tradition of judicial independence and the Rule of law in Hong Kong. At the same time, the courts of Hong Kong have had to tackle the classic constitutional problem of trying to work out the appropriate balance between civil liberties {{on the one hand and}} public order and communitarian values on the other hand. This article will review and evaluate how the Hong Kong courts have responded to these challenges. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: It is {{fifty years}} since the European Court of Human Rights was first {{established}} as the body responsible for deliberating on states’ compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights, a treaty adopted {{under the auspices of}} the Council of Europe in 1950. Since then, the Court has arguably established itself as one of the most effective human rights mechanisms in the world. Its jurisdiction now extends to 47 European states. Its judgments are legally binding on those states and have led directly to numerous changes in domestic law, policy and practice in a wide range of areas. The standards and principles laid down in the text of the Convention itself have been augmented by a series of additional protocols, and the Court has continually demonstrated an innovative and flexible approach to its role of interpreting the Convention, reflecting the well-established principle that the Convention is considered to be a ‘living instrument’. The Convention has acquired such an established and fundamental place in the European legal order that it has been described as “a <b>constitutional</b> <b>instrument</b> of European public order”. As Rolv Ryssdal, the former President of the Court has put it: As far as the democratic protection of individuals and institutions is concerned, the Convention has become the single most important legal and political denominator of the states of the continent of Europe in the widest geographical area. The Convention also served as a model for the American Convention on Human Rights (1969) and in certain respects also for the African Charter of Human and Peoples’ Rights (1981). The European human rights system has been through several stages of development before crystallizing in its current form as a permanent court. The Convention established a mechanism whose mandate was “to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the High Contracting Parties”. Three institutions were entrusted with this responsibility in the early years: the European Commission of Human Rights (set up in 1954), the European Court of Human Rights (set up in 1959) and the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. The Committee of Ministers originally had an adjudicative role, as well as being responsible for the supervision of the enforcement of the Court’s judgments Since the 1980 s, there has been a marked increase in the number of applications brought before the former European Commission and Court of Human Rights. The inexorable growth in the number of individual applications poses a serious threat to the effectiveness of the Convention system. Consequently a major challenge that the Court is facing is to handle applications within a reasonable time. As at 1 September 2008, there were 94, 650 cases pending before the Court. The Court’s ‘output’ has also risen steeply: in 2007, the Court delivered 1, 735 judgments and made 27, 057 decisions on admissibility (or striking out). However, the output is still not keeping pace with the incoming cases, hence the continuing rise in the backlog. While it may often have been suggested that the Court has become a ‘victim of its own success’, it can be more pertinently argued that the Court has become a victim of the failures of the member States...|$|E
40|$|The minimum {{consensus}} {{in defining the}} concept of a parliamentary system is closely related to the presence of the responsible government in the system governed by the principle of the separation of powers, which is the essential characteristic of parliamentarism. A constitutional and political theory classify this system as a model of parliamentary government that is elected by Parliament and responsible to Parliament, which is the essence and the common denominator of this system. Moreover, all the modalities of the system develop in line with the relations established between the legislative and the executive authorities, i. e. between the head of state, the government and the parliament. Nowadays, there is no 'pure' model of the parliamentary government, for at least two reasons. First, modern constitutions set up instruments of rationalization and transfer the focus of the constitutional power either to the government or to the head of state, but in any case 'away from' the parliament. Second, political framework of modern parliamentarism significantly contributes to the situation where the <b>constitutional</b> <b>instruments</b> aimed at preserving the balance receive a new legal and political meaning; thus, they serve some functions other than those prescribed by the constitution...|$|R

40|$|In the {{northern}} parts of Sweden forestry and Sami reindeer herding are exercised {{on the same}} land {{and there is an}} ongoing land use dispute between the land users. Land ownership and reindeer herding rights, based on immemorial prescription and customary law, are parallel property rights to the same land. Studies have concluded that the legal framework does not sufficiently reflect the property rights perspective of the land use conflict. This study examines the legal framework that regulates the relationship between forestry and reindeer herding from a property rights perspective. Starting points of the study are basic aspects of property rights, such as the right to use, decide on and benefit economically from property and the legal protection required in relation to others. Comparisons are made with the legal frameworks that regulate other relationships within real estate law, including e. g. neighbors, easements, joint facilities and utility easement. The study concludes that the relationship between land ownership and reindeer herding rights can be understood only against the background of historical events such as colonization and demarcation. The rights are more independent of each other than other legal relations and can be compared to a double ownership. It is further concluded that the Forestry Act {{is based on the assumption}} that reindeer herding is primarily a public interest that needs protection. Land owners have a far-reaching right to use forests that causes damages to reindeer pasture lands that is not in accordance with the legal nature of the reindeer herding right. Further, central elements usually used to regulate property rights relations are missing, e. g. mutual consideration, damages and judicial review. The study also examines if the legal framework is in accordance with the constitutional protection of property in Chapter 2 Section 15 of the <b>constitutional</b> <b>Instrument</b> of Government and Article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights. It is concluded that the legal framework has several deficiencies in this respect. Elements are discussed that can be implemented in law to appropriately reflect the property rights studied.

La consolidación del Nuevo Sistema, es {{fundamental}} para la democracia dentro de un Estado Constitucional de derecho, razón que motivó escribir esta tesis que contiene un análisis de la reforma y una propuesta para la consolidación de la misma, en virtud de que sí bien es cierto ésta principió hace trece años, la implementación que debe garantizar un adecuado funcionamiento del modelo se está realizando actualmente y de él depende el éxito o el fracaso de la reforma. Quienes hemos sido promotores del cambio, debemos demostrar que la correcta aplicación del sistema acusatorio, garantiza que el proceso penal sea el único instrumento constitucional para juzgar la culpabilidad o inocencia del procesado, que debe ser el objetivo de la justicia penal y que inspiró presente trabajo. The Republic of Guatemala {{has experienced}} {{the most important}} fact of its legal background, {{in the last decade}} of the 20 th century. It started with a reform in the criminal justice system, which radically changed, the administration of justice, abandoning at the same time, the inquisitorial model (written trial) an adopting the accusatory system (oral trial). The reform of the criminal justice system of Guatemala, formally started the first of July of 1994, with the going into effect of the new law for the reform of the criminal justice system, which in fact is not over yet. This open the door for the reform of the criminal justice system in Latin America, which has to be seen in the global context, as the result of political and economical facts that have changed the sequence of human history, as have disappearance of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War, the democratization of all countries of the area, the ever changing technological advances of the new society of knowledge and international globalization, that brought new criminal forms and social conflicts, which demand a rapid and transparent application of criminal justice, taking into consideration that it is fundamental in the construction of a democratic country, in the constitutional state of law. This is the central motivational factor of this doctoral thesis; basically contains an analysis of the criminal justice reform in Guatemala and a proposal that allows consolidation of this reform; considering the fact that the reform began twenty years ago, the real process that can guarantee an accurate implementation of the model, is currently in place, and everything else depends on the success or failure of the reform. This investigation is structured in six chapters; the first one explains the criminal justice reform in Guatemala and the second, the criminal justice reform in Latin America; the third one refers to the constitutional principles and guarantees of the criminal justice reform in Guatemala; the fourth, considers the main principles of the accusatory system; the fifth concerns the phases of the criminal justice reform in Guatemala and the sixth addresses the proposal for the implementation of the model, which is now been in progress, and the last chapter presents a conclusion, bibliography and a glossary. It is up to those of us, who in one way or another contribute, with the change, to demonstrate that the right application of the accusatory system in Guatemala, guaranties that the reform of criminal justice is the <b>constitutional</b> <b>instrument</b> to prove the guilt or innocence of the accused, and this should be primary objective of the criminal law. It is also the inspiration for this dissertation...|$|E

40|$|Housing meets {{a primary}} human need and housing rights are now {{enshrined}} housing rights within {{international human rights}} law, regional and <b>constitutional</b> legal <b>instruments.</b> These rights extend beyond shelter, and encompass adequacy, affordability of housing and security of tenure. Enforcing international housing rights has developed a corpus of jurisprudence, with key concepts of human dignity, minimum core obligations and progressive realization of rights being interpreted in local housing and legal contexts. Today, market and commoditisation approaches dominate the debate on housing shadowing housing rights discourse. Yet, housing rights provide a moral compass for housing law, policy and systems...|$|R

Section 2 briefly describes aspects of direct democratic decision making that we deem critical from a Constitutional economics perspective. In particular, we hint to changes in the political process if citizens are directly involved through initiatives and referendums...|$|R
40|$|A {{decade after}} {{the demise of the}} Charlottetown Accord in 1992, 1 one of the most visible {{features}} of federal-provincial relations is the replacement of constitutional with non-constitutional policy instruments to secure many of the same ends—the “flight from constitutional legalism. ” Instead of <b>constitutional</b> amendments, the <b>instrument</b> of choice is the non-legal, intergovernmental accord. The leading examples are the Social Union Framework Agreement and the Agreement on Internal Trade, which in differing levels of detail set out both a normative framework and an institutional architecture to manage the Social Union and the Economic Union, respectively. I argue, focusing on the Social Union, that this picture is radically incomplete in two respects. I suggest that the politics of social policy in the post-Charlottetown era are now somewhat broader in scope than they were before 1992, and encompass not just issues of substance, but issues of process as well, with the latter arguably assuming central importance. Moreover, I demonstrate that the shift to non-constitutional means should not obscure two facts. First, the law of the Constitution and constitutional litigation have played a limited role in the politics of social policy. Second, constitutional discourse outside the courts has been the primary vehicle for constitutional evolution. Indeed, the SUFA should, in this light, be interpreted as a <b>constitutional</b> policy <b>instrument.</b> Finally, I propose that, going forward, the courts should regard the shift from substance to process as a constitutional cue to play a limited but important role in the management of the Social Union...|$|R
