5|$|The Air Force's 1997 {{rejection}} of re-engining was subsequently disputed in a Defense Science Board (DSB) report in 2003. The DSB urged the Air Force to re-engine the aircraft without delay, saying {{doing so would}} not only create significant cost savings, but reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase aircraft range and endurance; these conclusions were {{in line with the}} conclusions of a separate Congress-funded study conducted in 2003. Criticizing the Air Force <b>cost</b> <b>analysis,</b> the DSB found that among other things, the Air Force failed to account for the cost of aerial refueling; the DSB estimated that refueling in the air cost $17.50 per gallon, whereas the Air Force had failed to account for the cost of fuel delivery and so had only priced fuel at $1.20 per gallon.|$|E

40|$|It is the {{objective}} of this study to analyze the methodologies used for the evaluation of alternative projects in the environmental planning procedure. There are many methodologies used for evaluation of a project or alternative actions such as financial <b>analysis,</b> <b>cost</b> effectiveness <b>analysis,</b> <b>cost</b> benefit <b>analysis</b> and multicriteria analysis. The main methodologies that are being considered in this study are <b>cost</b> benefit <b>analysis</b> and multicriteria analysis. They are two basic methodologies which facilitate the decision-making procedure especially in cases where many criteria should be taken into account in the decision-making model. The character of data being worked out by each methodology differs. <b>Cost</b> benefit <b>analysis</b> is a monetary based technique and all variables should have a monetary value while multicriteria analysis is a non-monetary technique and it can incorporate qualitative variables. The advantages and disadvantages of each methodology are being discussed in the study in order to find a methodology suitable for evaluating alternative actions under the sustainability concept. © 2007 WIT Press...|$|R

40|$|In this study, exergy <b>costing</b> <b>analysis</b> and {{performance}} evaluation of selected gas turbine {{power plants in}} Nigeria are carried out. The results of exergy analysis confirmed that the combustion chamber is the most exergy destructive component compared to other cycle components. The exergetic efficiency of the plants was found to depend significantly on a change in gas turbine inlet temperature (GTIT). The increase in exergetic efficiency {{with the increase in}} turbine inlet temperature is limited by turbine material temperature limit. This was observed from the plant efficiency defect curve. As the turbine inlet temperature increases, the plant efficiency defect decreases to minimum value at certain GTIT (1, 200  K), after which it increases with GTIT. This shows degradation in performance of gas turbine plant at high turbine inlet temperature. Exergy <b>costing</b> <b>analysis</b> shows that the combustion chamber has the greatest cost of exergy destruction compared to other components. Increasing the GTIT, both the exergy destruction and the cost of exergy destruction of this component are found to decrease. Also, from exergy <b>costing</b> <b>analysis,</b> the unit <b>cost</b> of electricity produced in the power plants varies from cents 1. 99 /kWh (N 3. 16 /kWh) to cents 5. 65 /kWh (N 8. 98 /kWh) ...|$|R
