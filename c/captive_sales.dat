5000|$|Peter Frantz was the Company's inventor. An {{adjustable}} lighting {{product called}} the [...] "Lightning Lamp Adjuster" [...] was patented and was among its first production products. The Company soon expanded its line to hardware products ranging from hinges to barn door track and hangers to garage door hardware {{for the new}} automobiles that began to appear. It distributed its products widely throughout the country using a <b>captive</b> <b>sales</b> force.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea that}} {{marketing}} can potentially {{eliminate the need}} for sales people depends entirely on context. For example, this may be possible in some B2C situations; however, for many B2B transactions (for example, those involving industrial organizations) this is mostly impossible. Another dimension is the value of the goods being sold. Fast-moving consumer-goods (FMCG) require no sales people at the point of sale to get them to jump off the supermarket shelf and into the customer's trolley. However, the purchase of large mining equipment worth millions of dollars will require a sales person to manage the sales process - particularly in the face of competitors. Small and medium businesses selling such large ticket items to a geographically-disperse client base use manufacturers' representatives to provide these highly personal service while avoiding the large expense of a <b>captive</b> <b>sales</b> force.|$|E
40|$|In {{antitrust}} {{cases as}} well as for regulated industries, {{the question of how to}} treat indirect constraint and <b>captive</b> <b>sales</b> correctly has become of major importance in Europe. The (im-) proper treatment of indirect constraints has lead the CFI to overturn the Commission’s decision in the proposed merger of Schneider and Legrand. Moreover, with regards to the definition of wholesale broadband access markets, there is an ongoing controversy between the Commission and some National Regulatory Authorities, centering on the question of whether to incorporate indirect constraints already at the stage of market definition. To inform this debate, we present in this article some of the insights from a detailed formal analysis into markets with indirect constraints and <b>captive</b> <b>sales.</b> We show how indirect constraints are appropriately taken into account through the elasticity of derived demand and comment also on the informative-ness of concentration measures on both the wholesale and retail market. We further derive insights into when indirect constraints may be more or less important compared with direct constraints. Finally, we also discuss the more practical difficulties that are encountered when analyzing (or estimating) market structures where forward integrated firms also sell to other, competing retail firms.

40|$|Commercial and {{government}} communication, radar, and information systems {{face the challenge}} of cost and mass reduction via the application of advanced packaging technology. A majority of both government and industry support has been focused on low frequency digital electronics. However higher operating frequencies for both digital and analog circuits will be required for future systems. 1997, projected domestic <b>captives</b> <b>sales</b> for Modules will be over a half billion dollars. Therefore, it is critical to develop the technical infrastructure necessary to support this emerging industry. This paper discusses the kick-off of a JPL sponsored Director's Discretionary Fund project to specifically address the needs of high frequency packaging and our coordination with NA SA's Lewis Research Center's ongoing efforts to provide commercial high frequency packaging technology. We are working with industry, universities, and DoD to characterize and analyze high frequency module packages. Our e [...] ...|$|R

50|$|First Colony Life (FCL) was an American life {{insurance}} {{company based in}} Lynchburg, Virginia that was merged with Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company, a Genworth Financial company in 2007. First Colony Life {{was one of the}} first {{life insurance}} companies to market term life insurance products through the fledgling independent brokerage general agency (BGA) distribution model instead of relying upon a <b>captive</b> career <b>sales</b> force in the 1950s.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a two-location stochastic inventory problem with periodic review. It {{is assumed that}} replenishment may be ordered only at times of periodic review but a provision is made for transfer of stock between the locations at predetermined times within the replenishment cycle. Problems of determining jointly optimal stockage and transfer rules according to the expected total cost criterion are investigated. Under certain regularity conditions, the optimality of a simple class of Base Stock Conserving (BSC) transfer rules is first established. The related optimal stockage rule is then characterized for the single period model of <b>captive</b> <b>sales.</b> ...|$|E
50|$|At last General Pollock and the {{relieving}} army appeared, only to {{find that}} the garrison had on 7 April 1842 relieved itself by a brilliant and completely successful attack on Akbar Khan's lines. His wife, who shared with him the dangers and hardships of the Afghan war, was among Akbar's <b>captives.</b> Lady <b>Sale</b> and her daughter were rescued by the general in person, advancing into hostile territory {{at the head of a}} detachment of cavalry. Amongst the few possessions she was able to keep from Afghan plunderers was her diary (Journal of the Disasters in Afghanistan, London, 1843).|$|R
5000|$|Jackson {{was named}} after Andrew Jackson, the 7th President of the United States. [...] Jackson was founded in 1961 in Jackson, Michigan, and moved to its {{headquarters}} in Lansing, Michigan in 1976. In the early years, the company focused on offering term insurance to individuals {{as an alternative to}} whole life products. Jackson was an early adopter of the independent distribution model, eliminating its <b>captive</b> agency <b>sales</b> force in 1970 to sell products through independent agents. By 1984, Jackson had grown to $1 billion in assets. The company's growth attracted the attention of Prudential plc, which acquired Jackson in 1986.|$|R
2500|$|On {{suitable}} terrain, the fast-moving horseman was {{the dominant}} force. When infantry operated on ground less favorable to cavalry however, and deployed firearms or disciplined archery, the mounted {{man was not}} as effective. Cavalry tactics were varied based on the mix of mounted and foot troops on hand for an operation. Infantry forces were usually larger, and the typical order of battle was a mass of infantry levies armed with hide shields, arrows, bows and spears, and a higher status mounted formation. Cavalry relied heavily on missile action, usually casting javelins {{in one or two}} passes, before closing in with lances for shock action. The infantry provided a steadying force if they could mass compactly enough to stand against cavalry charges. Raiding type tactics were standard, particularly in acquiring <b>captives</b> for <b>sale.</b> Generally the savanna cavalries used a [...] "combined arms" [...] approach, seldom operating without supporting infantry.|$|R
50|$|During the First Anglo-Afghan War, Lady Sale, {{along with}} other women and children, as well as soldiers, were kidnapped in 1842 and {{detained}} for nine months. The group were taken hostage by Akbar Khan following the massacre in the Khurd Karbul Pass. Amongst the hostages with Lady Sale was her youngest daughter Alexandrina, {{along with her husband}} Lieutenant John Sturt and their newborn daughter. Sturt was fatally injured by three dagger wounds to the abdomen, with Lady Sale nursing her son-in-law in his final hours. Upon his death, she secured him a Christian burial; he was the only fallen officer to receive such a burial. Lady Sale bribed the Afghan officers into releasing them; they were then rescued by Sir Richmond Shakespear on 17 September 1842. Her courageous and defiant actions meant that she endangered herself frequently; she was shot in the wrist, with the bullet lodging there. Throughout her time as a <b>captive,</b> Lady <b>Sale</b> kept a diary, detailing the events of the ordeal. A year later, Lady Sale published her journal which documented her experiences throughout the Afghan War, and the book received critical acclaim.|$|R
25|$|The British {{still held}} several {{garrison}}s in Afghanistan: at Kandahar under Nott, at Ghazni {{on the route}} between Kandahar and Kabul, and at Jalalabad under <b>Sale.</b> The <b>captive</b> General Elphinstone had sent orders to the other garrison commanders {{that they were to}} evacuate their positions {{under the terms of the}} capitulation he had agreed with Akbar Khan. (Elphinstone died in April, still a <b>captive.)</b> Nott and <b>Sale</b> ignored Elphinstone's order, but Colonel Thomas Palmer at Ghazni obeyed it, withdrawing from the easily defended citadel into vulnerable buildings in the city. Shah Shuja still held the fortress of Bala Hissar in Kabul and was attempting to bribe chiefs and tribes to his cause, although he was no longer supported by the British. He even attempted to improve his standing within Afghanistan by demanding that the British comply with the terms Elphinstone had agreed with Akbar Khan.|$|R
50|$|On 22 April 1648 Khmelnitsky and 5,000 Cossacks {{left the}} Sich and marched into the Ukraine. With {{them was a}} Tatar {{auxiliary}} force under Tugay Bey. To suppress the uprising the Polish government 30,000 men under Crown Grand Hetman Mikołaj Potocki and Crown Field Hetman Marcin Kalinowski. Potocki sent a 6,000-man vanguard under his son Stefan Potocki to Zaporozhia and placed the main body between Korsun and Cherkassy. A detachment of registered Cossacks, who were with the avant-garde and were moving separately by boats down the Dnieper, defected to Khmelnytsky. On April 29 - May 16 at the Battle of Zhovti Vody ("Yellow Waters") the Cossacks and Tatars surrounded and defeated the Polish vanguard under Stefan Potocki. On 26 May the 20,000-man main army under Nicholas Potocki and Martin Kalinowski, which had divided into two groups, was surrounded and defeated by the rebellious Cossacks and Tatars at the Battle of Korsuń. The Poles lost up to 7,000 killed and 9,000 captured. Both Potocki and Kalinowski were captured. After the first victories throughout the whole Ukraine there broke out a national liberation war against the Polish gentry domination. In May the Khan with 11,000 Tatars joined his new ally at Bila Tserkva ('White Church'), and from there sent raiding parties to plunder and ravage the surrounding Ukrainian lands, devastating the Kiev region and Volhynia and taking many captives. In September the Khan sent another army under his brother and 'Kalga' or designated heir Kerim Giray. At the Battle of Pyliavtsi Khmelnytsky's Cossack-Tatar army defeated Polish-gentry militia under Władysław Dominik Zasławski, Mikołaj Ostroróg and Alexander Koniecpolski. Kalga-Sultan Karim Giray took no part {{in the battle of}} Pilyavtsi, but joined the Cossacks later and took part in the Khmelnytsky's campaign on the Polish cities of Lvov and Zamość. The uprising of the Ukrainian Cossacks became a liberation war for the independence of Ukraine {{and the creation of a}} Ukrainian state. In all of these battles the Crimean Tatar troops proved to be unreliable allies, fighting only for their own goal, which was to rob people and carry away <b>captives</b> for <b>sale</b> in Crimea. Islam Giray feared a serious weakening of Poland, and constantly betrayed his ally Khmelnytsky.|$|R
