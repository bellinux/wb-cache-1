2500|$|The {{field of}} machine ethics is {{concerned}} with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making. The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: [...] "Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The {{time has come for}} adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to <b>computer</b> <b>ethics,</b> machine ethics {{is concerned with}} the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension {{is at the root of}} all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing our thinking about Ethics." [...] Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality. A variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition [...] "Machine Ethics" [...] that stems from the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics.|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} {{is aimed at}} understanding employees’ perception towards <b>computer</b> use <b>ethic</b> at the workplace. In view of this, the research investigates {{the extent to which}} personal characteristics such as gender, religious belief and an employee’s position in the organizational hierarchy can influence his/her attitude towards <b>computer</b> use <b>ethic.</b> The data used for this qualitative research was drawn from in-depth and intensive semi-structured interviews of six prominent professionals; four from the private sector and two from the public sector. Out of the six professionals, there were three males and three females. The study made some interesting revelations; that <b>computer</b> use <b>ethic</b> {{is one of the greatest}} concerns for employers which needs to be tactfully addressed through values based orientation rather than compliance or legal based orientation; and as compared to gender and organizational position, religious belief has the greatest impact in guiding and influencing employees towards ethical computer use at the workplace...|$|R

40|$|Exponentially growing {{popularity}} of computer games and the ever-growing cultural influence inspires discussions about possibly unethical game contents, unmoral player actions or negative consequences to the society. Game ethics emerged as a discipline to address these questions. However it seems that usually, when talking about <b>computer</b> game <b>ethics,</b> {{the importance of the}} basic assumptions on the questions of game theory is being overlooked. Therefore this paper argues that different basic assumptions about the relationship between the game/world, player/game designer can lead to very different ethical conclusions. It is achieved by analyzing the discourse of <b>computer</b> game <b>ethics,</b> further by overlooking the possible positions on these theoretical questions, and, finally, by using particular examples, how these different theoretical assumptions lead to different conclusions...|$|R

It takes as its start-ing point the philosophical justifications given for freedom of speech in (Greenawalt, in <b>Computers,</b> <b>Ethics</b> and Social Values, Prentice-Hall, 1995). For each of these justifications I discuss the types of speech to which they apply, and implications for virtual communities. The justifications imply several limitations to free-dom of speech within a well-run virtual community. I give some examples in which the existence of virtual communities can be used to reflect on extant philosophical arguments and practices. By applying the list of steps for thinking about systems given in (Churchman, inThe Systems Approach, New York: Dell Publish-ing Co., Inc., 1968), I obtain a classification framework for think-ing about the merits and demerits of a particular speech act, and describe a justification for freedom of speech, missing fro...|$|R

40|$|From a cyber-security perspective, {{attribution}} {{is considered}} to be the ability to determine the originating location for an attack. However, should such an attribution system be developed and deployed, it would provide attribution for all traffic, not just attack traffic. This has several implications for both the senders and receivers of traffic, as well as the intervening organizations, Internet service providers and nation-states. In this paper we examine the requirements for an attribution system, identifying all of the actors, their potential interests, and the resulting policies they might therefore have. We provide a general framework that represents the attribution problem, and outline the technical and policy requirements for a solution. We discuss the inevitable policy conflicts due to the social, legal and cultural issues that would surround such a system.

40|$|The Howard R.

The College has a diverse graduate student population, including a sizable international component, who are enrolled in several M. S. and Ph. D. degree programs within four departments.

Therefore, a standalone workshop was developed that covered four major topics: Research <b>Ethics,</b> <b>Computer</b> Coding <b>Ethics,</b> Publishing Ethics, and Intellectual Property. The last topic covered copyright law, patent law, and trade secrets. To develop this ethics workshop, some ethics instruction programs at U. S. engineering colleges were investigated...|$|R
40|$|Building {{technology}} to support students who must learn ethics {{and social issues}} is a difficult problem. In fact ethics and social issues {{is an example of}} an ill-defined domains, which typically are resistant to standard intelligent tutoring systems techniques. An analysis of current pedagogical tools for teaching <b>Computer</b> Science <b>ethics</b> and social issues using Bloom’s Taxonomy shows that the task needs tools for achieving Application, Evaluation and Creation educational goals. One promising approach which has the potential to achieve such goals is educational games. This paper explores a proof of concept educational game called Conundrum. This serious game provides three ways for learners to interact with it, each supporting a level of Bloom’s Taxonomy. An experiment was run in a <b>Computer</b> Science <b>ethics</b> and social issues class showing promising results that the design of Conundrum led to students achieving Application, Evaluation and Creation goals. A multidimensional student model was also developed to aid instructors and learners understand their progress. The experiment showed that the design of Conundrum did have some good aspects but leaves a lot of future work to maximize its potential...|$|R

He encouraged Maner to publish his booklet, [...] "A Starter-Kit on Teaching Computer Ethics", with the help of a small publishing company, Helvetia Press, that Bynum and his Swiss wife had created to disseminate applied-philosophy teaching materials generated by National Workshop-Conferences on Teaching Philosophy.

Internet has a major impact over all activity fields: political, social, economic and private life of users, as well. Newly developed, models of on-line business are a basic element in economic growth of a company. Taking into account the specificity of access on the Internet, it is necessary to establish/create/set and respect clear principles and rules to access the virtual business environment. These are created by specialized organizations or even developed in internal frame of the companies. Using these rules, acceptable activities and unacceptable activities (for a potential user of Internet) are defined. In the time that ethics defines a concept related to the adequate conduct of a person in the social environment, we can speak about business ethics, especially business on-line ethics. Ethics appears in relation among persons or in relation between persons and <b>computers.</b> <b>Ethics</b> is in business environment, in this case, virtual environment, but to the workplace, too.
