One hundred two (102) randomly selected <b>cutflower</b> farmers underwent comprehensive, personal physical health and laboratory examinations and answered a questionnaire on work practices and illness. Majority were males (52 %) and most belonged to the 20 – 35 age group (45 %). Majority of exposed farmers were symptomatic, with most common complaints being headache (48 %), easy fatigability (46. 1 %) and cough (40. 2 %). Analysis showed that RBC cholinesterase levels were positively associated with age (p = 0. 02), and selling pesticide containers (p = 0. 008). {{number of years of}} using pesticides (p = 0. 022), use of contaminated cloth (p = 0. 033), incorrect mixing of pesticides (p = 0. 041), sex (p = 0. 002) and illness due to pesticides (p = 0. 005) were correlated with abnormal MCV. Significant associations were also found for hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, white blood cell (WBC) and platelet count. Predictors of RBC cholinesterase were years of pesticide use (p = 0. 037) and abnormalities on health (p = 0. 029).

40|$|This thesis {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on decision making and proposes two decision-making models: a generic model of primary production systems and a model of <b>cutflower</b> growers, and attempts to validate both. From the literature, twelve decision-making models {{from a range of}} sources (theoretical, empirical, primary and non-primary production systems) are reviewed from a soft systems perspective, and a new seven-phase generic model is developed. These seven phases are: Problem detection and prospecting; Problem definition; Acquisition of information; Consideration of alternatives; Making a choice; Implementation; and Checking and judgement. A survey of 26 <b>cutflower</b> growers endorses the generic model, and it is expanded to describe the steps used in decision-making by <b>cutflower</b> growers. Further analysis and validation of the <b>cutflower</b> decision-making model occurs by conducting a single case study on a sandersonia grower. The proposed generic model incorporates the best features of all the models reviewed, and it has a number of key differences from other models: • It shows the cyclic and iterative interrelationship of the components, • All the phases are highly dependent on a number of factors, including the goals, aspirations and preferences of the decision maker, and external factors, • A new dimension called 'Prospecting' has been added to 'Identify problem' as it can be an important trigger to start the decision making process, particularly in relation to new crop choices, • 'Judgement' is used during the checking process, and is strongly influenced by the way people learn. The process of learning is a synthesis of finding out and taking action much as the process of decision making is, • The new model reflects decisions made under all degrees of uncertainty and risk. It also describes the decisions made over a range of decision types, whether they are operational, tactical or strategic. Analysis of the case study revealed that further modifications were required to the newly proposed decision-making model of <b>cutflower</b> growers. These included restructuring the model so that 'Information' is a much more intrinsic part of the decision making process as it is involved in all phases of the decision-making process. The phases of 'Problem detection and prospecting' and 'Problem definition' were considered to be too similar to warrant two categories, therefore they were combined. The phases 'Consideration of alternatives' and 'Choice' have also been combined, not only because they are similar actions but also because of the higher iterative relationship the two have.

The aim of this study was to determine suitable preservatives and optimal vaselife conditions that could prevent or minimise postharvest stem bending of Gerbera jamesonii “Black diamond”. The variety “Black diamond was selected and treated with four different floral preservative solutions. The relationship between stem bending and absorption rate of the preservative solutions was established. The data gathered indicated that there was a significant difference to the solution absorption rate and stem bending. Stem bending differed from 0 to 38 degrees. Stems treated on control, preservative 3 and 4 recorded the highest degrees of bending, while preservative 1 and 2 recorded the lowest degrees of stem bending within 12 day period.

Moreover, anthocyanin and carotenoid contents were quantitatively analyzed. As a result, the following facts were known: 1) By measuring the absorption spectra of fresh flower petals, it was clarified that the main pigments constituting the colors of chrysanthemum flowers were found to be carotenoid and anthocyanin; 2) The yellow flowers became either deep or light yellow depending on the content of carotenoid; 3) Pink or red-purple color of flowers is by anthocyanin, while bronze or red by carotenoid and anthocyanin. In the case of the latter, the increase of carotenoid content, rather than that of anthocyan, results in the display of bronze, while, in an adverse case, red color is displayed. At the peak of anthocyanin, the red and bronze flowers differ slightly in their respective wave lengths. The cause for such a difference of color is not known clearly, but it is assumed that such is due to co-pigmentation by flavonoid.

At the onset of leaf blackening sugars and starch were lower in both inflorescences and leaves. Proportionately, sugars and starch decreased more in leaves than in inflorescences. Flower-bearing shoots of 'Sylvia' were pulsed individually with 5 % glucose solution until each shoot had taken up 10 mL solution. Water served for control treatment. Flowers were then stored for 21 days at 1 °C. After pulsing and after cold storage groups of flowering shoots were separated into inflorescence, leaf and stem components and glucose and starch content determined. Glucose content, determined upon completion of pulsing treatments, was significantly greater in all shoot components of shoots pulsed glucose compared with nonpulsed control shoots. Glucose content of leaves was significantly greater after storage for shoots pulsed than control shoots. Starch content of leaves determined upon completion of pulsing treatments was significantly greater in shoots pulsed with glucose than that of controls. There was a significant decrease in starch content for all tissue types during 21 days of storage.

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{to improve the quality}} of chrysanthemum, this {{research}} is to explore the quality change of chrysanthemum cut flower under various amount of compression deformation and period of transportation as well as its relaxation and creeping behavor. By knowing information about compression effects, one can control the bud transformation and find the best size packing in practice. The results showed that the longer chrysanthemum cut flower was in the post-harvest process, the more broken leaves it had, the shorter its flowers and leaves lasted, and smaller its blossoms were. It was also showed that the amount of brokeneaves increased and the size of blossoms decreased when chrysanthemum cut flower was packed in the lower layers of packages. The force relaxation of chrysanthemum cut flower was predicted by a Generalized Maxwell model which consisted of three parallel Maxwell elements. According to an equation of chrysanthemum cut flower force relaxation, it was predicted that in the condition of 10 mm deformation, the relaxation force of chrysanthemum cut flower buds would became " 0 " after 15 hours. Thus, the beginning deformation would become permanent. Therefore, for the lower layer packages of chrysanthemumcut flower, its allowable amount of deformation should be the added value of the beginning deformation and its deformation during the saving period cause by its creeping behavior. In the case of chrysanthemum cut flower with an average weight of 60 g, its deformation was 1. 52 mm after saving for 12 days. Since the allowable deformation for chrysanthemum buds was 5 mm, the beginning deformation should be less than 3. 84 mm. So, for a package of 200 pieces of chrysanthemum <b>cutflower,</b> the best height of its package should be 26. 8 cm. 菊花栽培與外銷為台灣中部地區一項重要的產業，本研究主要目的在於探 討台灣地區輸日菊花在現行包裝儲運過程中，菊花花苞在不同的壓縮量與 不同儲運時間下之品質變化，以及菊花花苞受壓縮後之負荷鬆弛與潛變現 象，以控制花苞之變形量，求取最佳之包裝紙箱尺寸，以改善菊花外銷品 質。根據本研究顯示，外銷菊花在現行儲運方式下，破損葉片數、葉片壽 命、花朵壽命、花朵開度等各項品質指標均隨儲存時間之延長呈顯著下降 趨勢，且位於紙箱下層之菊花其破損葉片數量較上層有極顯著之增加，花 朵開度方面較上層亦有顯著之減小。菊花花苞之負荷鬆弛特性可用三個馬 克斯威爾元件並聯所組成的一般化馬克斯威爾模式來預測。根據所得之負 荷鬆弛特性方程式預測，菊花花苞在 10 mm變形量之下，經過 15 小時以後， 其內部應力將降為"零"，因此裝箱時之初始變形量都將成為永久變形，因 此最下層菊花花苞可容許之最大變形量，應為裝箱時之初始壓縮變形量與 下層菊花於儲存期間，因潛變因素所增加之變形量兩者之總和。以單枝平 均重量 60 g之菊花為例，冷藏儲存 12 天後，菊花花苞因潛變因素所導致之 變形量為 1. 52 mm，而菊花花苞容許之最大變形量為 5 mm，因此在裝箱時菊 花花苞之最大可容許壓縮變形量應為 3. 84 mm，故每箱 200 支菊花之包裝方 式，其紙箱之最佳高度應為 26. 8 cm...|$|E

40|$|Protea cynaroides L. (King Protea) is a {{well known}} <b>cutflower.</b> Seeds and stem {{cuttings}} are commonly used to propagate P. cynaroides. However, the success rate and rooting rate of seeds and cuttings, are inconsistent and slow. The potential of in vitro propagation as an alternative method to produce P. cynaroides plantlets was investigated. In vitro studies consisted of in vitro germination of mature zygotic embryos, micrografting and direct somatic embryogenesis of zygotic embryos and excised cotyledons. In the germination study, temperature {{was the most important}} factor in obtaining a high germination percentage. Alternating temperatures of 21 ± 2 ºC/ 12 ± 2 ºC (light/dark) was suitable for germination and over 90 % of embryos germinated, while the germination percentage of embryos at 25 ± 2 ºC was poor. Plantlets were successfully established in ex vitro conditions when planted in a peat/coir/sand mixture. Micrografting of P. cynaroides was done by grafting microshoots (microscion), which was taken from in-vitro-established nodal explants, onto roots of decapitated in-vitro-germinated seedlings. After the graft union formed, buds on the microscion sprouted. A protocol to induce direct somatic embryogenesis was developed. Direct somatic embryogenesis was achieved on both P. cynaroides mature zygotic embryos and excised cotyledons. The addition of auxins such as NAA and 2, 4 -D singly or in combination with TDZ, BAP or kinetin suppressed the formation of somatic embryos. Formation of somatic embryos was observed in medium lacking growth regulators. Germination of somatic embryos was highest in medium containing GA 3. The roles of starch and phenolic compounds in the rooting of P. cynaroides cuttings were also studied. Starch and total soluble phenol analyses results revealed a positive correlation between high root formation and increased starch and phenolic content. NMR and MS analyses identified high amounts of 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid in stems of P. cynaroides. In vitro bioassay showed that 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid stimulated and inhibited root growth of P. cynaroides explants, depending on the concentration. A link was made between the endogenous concentration levels of 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid and rooting of P. cynaroides stem cuttings. Findings of this study contribute towards a better understanding of the roles starch and phenolic compounds play in the rooting of P. cynaroides.

The mean duration of a life cycle of L. trifolii on various cultiva of Gerbera was 19. 2 days in total, and larva developmental duration was 7. 4 days, and these data were significantly different among various cultiva. The population density of adults were monitored in field by yellow sticky traps the results showed that it was significantly different existed on various cultiva of Gerbera. The highest density was 32. 3 adults on Merigold, the lowest density was 10. 9 adults on Fuego. The sequence of preference of L. trifolii adult to the flowers, leaves and leaf-juice of various cultiva of Gerbera was Merigold, Ambition, and Jamilla. The injury of L. trifolii on Gerbera was mainly due to the third instar larvae, which caused about 85 % of the total injury area. The releasing of 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 females on various cultiva of Gerbera resulted different grades from 1. 1 to 2. 6 of damage. The quantity losses of Gerbera cut-flowers ranged from 19. 5 ~ 33. 6 %, that caused a loss of 10883 ~ 18753 N. T＄/ 0. 1 hectare of Gerbera in winter crops, that shown the lower damage tolerance of Gerbera. It is suggestion that pest control must be done when the first instar larvae occurred. Various cultivars of Gerbera damage by L. trifolii of different densities caused them to produce cutflowers with shorter stems, smaller flowers, and lighter weight to different extends. Results showed that cultiva Ambition was sensitive and severely damage while cultiva Fuego was comparatively resistant.

An isolate from Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott was not serologically related to the other isolates. Further isolates from C. esculenta also exhibited no relationship. The modal length was different {{as well as the}} ability of complementary deoxyribonucleic acid, produced to the viral ribonucleic acid, to bind with some of the primers used in the polymerase chain reaction. This evidence led to the proposal that the isolate from C. esculenta was not dasheen mosaic potyvirus; this virus is tentatively named taro feathery mottle potyvirus. Cytoplasmic inclusion protein aggregates of dasheen mosaic potyvirus were purified from infected leaf tissue. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of samples revealed a major band with an estimated molecular weight of 68, 000 daltons. Such a band was absent from healthy tissue samples. The ATPase activity in samples from each purification step was determined by measuring the amount of [32 P] released from the [λ- 32 P]ATP during incubation with the cytoplasmic inclusion protein. The level of ATPase activity in each sample showed a strong correlation with the amount of protein that was present. In a limited survey of commercial plantings twenty nine tubers grown for <b>cutflower</b> or tuber export were obtained from seven properties at different locations in New Zealand and grown on in a greenhouse. Each plant was indexed for virus infection. Electron microscopy revealed that plants from three of the properties contained 720 nm flexuous rods. Samples from all but two plants tested positive to a potyvirus group antiserum using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The remaining two plants tested positive in microprecipitin and rapid immune electron microscopy tests to an antiserum prepared to a member of the carlavirus group. Particles from these plants were mechanically transmitted to Nicotiana tabacum 'Havana'. Rod-shaped particles of 300 nm were observed in plants from four properties and tested positive to tobacco mosaic tobamovirus antiserum using a microprecipitin test. While inoculations to herbaceous indicators resulted in no symptoms, 300 nm particles were observed in samples from the indicator plants. Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus, potato X potexvirus and cucumber mosaic cucumovirus, reported to infect Zantedeschia spp, were not detected...|$|E
40|$|The rust fungi (Uredinales, Basidiomycota) are an {{expansive}} and {{diverse group of}} fungal species, consisting of approximately 7000 different species in over 160 different genera. Fungi of the genus Puccinia represent {{a large proportion of}} these rust fungi, many species of which are well known for their role in causing massive yield and subsequent economic losses in agricultural crops worldwide. Puccinia boroniae is one such rust fungus and is a significant pathogen of several species of Boronia (Rutaceae), a native Australian wildflower grown commercially in Western Australia as a <b>cutflower.</b> Complete control of the rust pathogen is rarely achieved using chemical fungicides. Improving the level of disease control is vital for the long-term sustainability and future growth of the Boronia industry, and requires an understanding of the pathogen. The objectives of this thesis were to investigate aspects of the epidemiology, the biology and the diversity of P. boroniae in Western Australia, providing a broad understanding of the pathogen, which in turn could be employed to improve disease control. The lifecycle of P. boroniae was conclusively shown to be microcyclic by artificial inoculation of Boronia heterophylla with basidiospores released from germinating teliospores suspended over the host plant. Telia developed on the leaves within 21 days, with no intermediate rust spore stages (pycnial, uredial or aecial) observed. Rarely, low numbers of pycnia of P. boroniae were observed on field specimens collected from leaves of B. megastigma cultivated at one commercial floriculture plantation. This was the first record of pycnia of P. boroniae; however, as pycnia were not observed on other host species or plantations, or formed during controlled inoculation trials, their functional role in the lifecycle is currently unresolved. Telia were subepidermal, erumpent and pulvinate, amphigenous on leaves, stems and parts of developing flower buds, and generally persistent year round. Intracellular hyphae resembling monokaryotic haustoria (M-haustoria) were observed in leaf mesophyll cells beneath and adjacent of telia. Occasionally Sphaerellopsis filum (teleomorph Eudarluca caricis), a known mycoparasite of rust fungi, was observed on the telia. Under favourable conditions, teliospores germinated immediately without a period of dormancy, with fully mature basidiospores formed within 3 - 4 h after telia were exposed to moisture. Basidial development in P. boroniae was unusual, in that only one basidiospore was formed from each germinating teliospore cell. Immature teliospores were initially binucleate undergoing karyogamy to form a single large (presumably diploid) nucleus that migrated into the developing metabasidium. Both binucleate and tetranucleate metabasidia were observed, with mature uninucleate, binucleate and tetranucleate basidiospores present. At this stage, more research is required to understand the complete nuclear behaviour during teliospore germination. The morphology of the pycnial stage was similar to other Puccinia species, being ampulliform, subepidermal, amphigenous and arranged in small clusters on leaves of B. megastigma. However, the spine-like periphyses protruded through stomata as apposed to penetrating the leaf epidermis. Environmental conditions favouring the formation and dispersal of basidiospores were assessed in vitro and under field conditions with a spore catcher. Under field conditions, basidiospores were captured from February-August 2004, with peak numbers and daily incidence occurring during autumn (April/May) when the average temperature range was 9. 1 - 22. 6 degrees C. Daily basidiospore numbers were positively correlated with minimum daily temperature and total daily rainfall. A distinct diurnal periodicity of release was observed, with numbers peaking on average between 02 : 00 and 05 : 00 hrs. The hourly release of basidiospores was positively correlated with relative humidity and negatively correlated with temperature and evaporation. This data was in agreement with the in vitro experimentation, which showed that basidiospore formation occurred between 10 - 25 plus-minus 1 degrees C (apparent optimal temperature of 15 - 20 plus-minus 1 degrees C) with telia incubated in continuous darkness promoting a greater number of basidiospores. The level of genetic variation of P. boroniae in Western Australia was assessed by PCR-RFLP of the nuclear ribosomal intergenic spacer 2 (IGS 2) region. Two RFLP profiles were observed, separating three specimens (Group 1) from the remaining population (Group 2). Sequence analysis indicated that point mutations at endonuclease recognition sites were responsible for the changes in RFLP profile. Group 2 specimens had been collected from the same host species (B. megastigma) and plantation, and it is suggested that the variant specimens may constitute a subspecies of P. boroniae, isolated by geographic location and possibly host (cultivar) specificity. Further analysis, primarily pathogenicity trials, is needed to confirm this. This study has improved our knowledge regarding the rust fungus P. boroniae and has laid strong foundations for future research into several aspects of the biology, epidemiology and population variation. The implications of the key findings of this research, with an emphasis on the management of P. boroniae in commercial situations, are discussed...|$|E
