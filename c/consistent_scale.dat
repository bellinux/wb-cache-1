40|$|We {{present a}} novel type of feature that is robust to {{challenging}} {{images that are}} mainly due to large illumination variations. The keypoints are detected {{so that they are}} repeat-able with <b>consistent</b> <b>scales</b> in images of different illuminations, and the descriptors are formed by the context of neighboring line segments. Similar to many popular local fea-tures, the proposed feature is robust to occlusions, viewpoint changes and image clutters. Differently, while most state-of-the-art features can only handle small or monotonic il-lumination changes, our proposed feature is capable to match images with large and non-monotonic illumination variations. Through extensive experiments, the proposed feature is demonstrated to be robust and efficient in matching such challenging images. ...|$|R

Sediment deposits created during overwash exhibit <b>consistent</b> <b>scaling</b> — for example, the distance inland that an overwash deposit extends is proportional to the area that the overwash deposit covers. The distance inland that an overwash deposit extends is also correlated with the volume of sand deposited. The amount of overwash and washover sedimentation also depends on the characteristics of the storm and the setting — coastal development tends to reduce in the amount of sand deposited on a barrier island during overwash, with consequences for barrier island evolution.|$|R

In 1960, the art historian Kenneth Clark {{made the point}} that the success of the composition is a result first and foremost of the accurate handling of light and shade: Each focal point involves us in a new set of relations; and to paint a complex group like the Meninas, the painter must carry in his head a single <b>consistent</b> <b>scale</b> of relations which he can apply throughout. He may use all kinds of devices to help him do this—perspective is one of them—but ultimately the truth about a complete visual impression depends on one thing, truth of tone.

40|$|The {{critical}} {{behavior of}} the cubic helimagnet FeGe was obtained from isothermal magnetization data in very close vicinity of the ordering temperature. A thorough and <b>consistent</b> <b>scaling</b> analysis of these data revealed the critical exponents β= 0. 368, γ= 1. 382, and δ= 4. 787. The anomaly in the specific heat associated with the magnetic ordering can be well described by the critical exponent α=- 0. 133. The values of these exponents corroborate that the magnetic phase transition in FeGe belongs to the isotropic 3 D-Heisenberg universality class. The specific heat data are well described by ab initio phonon calculations and confirm the localized character of the magnetic moments. Comment: 10 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a framework for}} model reduction of chain models for dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations, where the characteristic size of the chain, pressure, density, and temperature are preserved.

Based on geometrical considerations we map fine-grained models to a reference state through a <b>consistent</b> <b>scaling</b> of the system, where short length and fast time scales are disregarded while the properties governing the phase equilibria are preserved. Following this coarse graining process we consistently represent high molecular weight DPD chains (i. e., > 200 beads per chain) with {{a significant reduction in}} the number of particles required (i. e., > 20 times the original system) ...|$|R
