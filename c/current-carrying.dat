5|$|The CGS {{absolute}} unit {{of electric}} current, the abampere, had been {{defined in terms}} of the force between two parallel <b>current-carrying</b> wires in 1881. In the 1940s, the International Electrotechnical Commission adopted an MKS variant of this definition for the ampere, which was adopted in 1948 by the CGPM.|$|E
5|$|Ørsted did {{not fully}} {{understand}} his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by Ampère, who discovered that two parallel <b>current-carrying</b> wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting currents {{in the same direction}} are attracted to each other, while wires containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart. The interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition of the ampere.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} {{that the use}} of explicit-constant definitions of the unit being defined that are not related to an example of its quantity will have many adverse effects. Although this criticism applies to the proposed linking of the kilogram to the Planck constant via a route that requires a knowledge of both special relativity and quantum mechanics, it does not apply to the proposed definition of the ampere, which is closer to an example of its quantity than is the current definition. Some observers have welcomed the proposal to base the definition of electric current on the charge of the electron rather than the current definition of a force between two parallel <b>current-carrying</b> wires – since the nature of the electromagnetic interaction between two bodies at the quantum electrodynamics level is somewhat different from the nature at classical electrodynamic levels, it is considered inappropriate to use classical electrodynamics to define quantities that exist at quantum electrodynamic levels.|$|E
25|$|A second {{limitation}} of the <b>current-carrying</b> capacity {{is caused by the}} ohmic bulk resistance of the electrodes themselves. For metallized film capacitors, which have layer thicknesses from 0.02 to 0.05μm the <b>current-carrying</b> capacity is limited by these thin layers.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} force {{component of the}} Lorentz force manifests itself as the force that acts on a <b>current-carrying</b> wire in a magnetic field. In that context, it is also called the Laplace force.|$|E
25|$|One {{application}} of this is Ampère's force law, which describes how two <b>current-carrying</b> wires can attract or repel each other, since each experiences a Lorentz force from the other's magnetic field. For more information, see the article: Ampère's force law.|$|E
25|$|In magnetostatics, {{the force}} of {{attraction}} or repulsion between two <b>current-carrying</b> wires (see first figure below) is often called Ampère's force law. The physical origin of this force is that each wire generates a magnetic field, following the Biot–Savart law, and the other wire experiences a magnetic force as a consequence, following the Lorentz force law.|$|E
25|$|The {{expressions}} given above for {{momentum and}} kinetic energy are only valid {{when there is}} no significant electromagnetic contribution. In electromagnetism, Newton's second law for <b>current-carrying</b> wires breaks down unless one includes the electromagnetic field contribution to the momentum of the system as expressed by the Poynting vector divided by c2, where c is the speed of light in free space.|$|E
25|$|American {{wire gauge}} (AWG), {{also known as}} the Brown & Sharpe wire gauge, is a {{standardized}} wire gauge system used since 1857 predominantly in North America for the diameters of round, solid, nonferrous, electrically conducting wire. Dimensions of the wires are given in ASTM standard B 258. The cross-sectional area of each gauge is an important factor for determining its <b>current-carrying</b> capacity.|$|E
25|$|The numeral {{preceding}} the hyphen indicates the type's particular configuration; {{that is to}} say the number of poles (<b>current-carrying</b> terminals) and wires connected to it, the voltage meant to be used with, and whether for use with single- or three-phase power. A connector with ground terminal is described as having more wires than poles, e.g. two-pole, three-wire; or four-pole, five-wire; etc. A non-grounding device may be two-pole, two-wire; three-pole, three-wire; etc.|$|E
25|$|The NEMA 5-15 plug has two flat {{parallel}} blades like NEMA 1-15, {{but also}} adds a ground (earth) pin. It is rated 15A at 125 volts. The ground (earth) pin {{is longer than}} the line and neutral blades, so the device is grounded before the power is connected. Both <b>current-carrying</b> blades on grounding plugs are normally narrow, since the ground (earth) pin enforces polarity. NEMA 1-15 plugs are also compatible with NEMA 5-15 sockets.|$|E
25|$|The {{surge current}} rating of film {{capacitors}} {{can be enhanced}} by various internal configurations. Because metallization is the cheapest way of producing electrodes, optimizing {{the shape of the}} electrodes is one way to minimize the internal resistance and to increase the <b>current-carrying</b> capacity. A slightly thicker metallization layer at the schoopage contact sides of the electrodes results in a lower overall contact resistance and increased surge current handling, without losing the self-healing properties throughout the remainder of the metallization.|$|E
25|$|Three-pin XLR {{connectors}} {{are by far}} {{the most}} common style, and are an industry standard for balanced audio signals. The great majority of professional microphones use the XLR connector. In previous years, they were used for loudspeaker connections, for instance by Trace Elliot in its bass enclosures. The XLR could accept 14AWG (1.6mm) wire with a <b>current-carrying</b> capacity of 15 amps, suitable for most loudspeakers, but they have been superseded by the Speakon connector for professional loudspeakers. The Speakon connector accepts larger wire and carries more current, and it provides a better shield for the contacts, which may carry dangerous voltages when connected to an amplifier.|$|E
25|$|Low-voltage {{miniature}} {{circuit breakers}} (MCB) use air alone to extinguish the arc. These circuit breakers contain so-called arc chutes, a stack of mutually insulated parallel metal plates which divide and cool the arc. By splitting the arc into smaller arcs the arc is cooled down while the arc voltage is increased and serves as an additional impedance which limits the current through the circuit breaker. The <b>current-carrying</b> parts near the contacts provide easy deflection of the arc into the arc chutes by a magnetic force of a current path, although magnetic blowout coils or permanent magnets could also deflect the arc into the arc chute (used on circuit breakers for higher ratings).So The number of plates in the arc chute {{is dependent on the}} short-circuit rating and nominal voltage of the circuit breaker.|$|E
500|$|The Electromagnetic {{system of}} units (EMU) was {{developed}} from André-Marie Ampère's discovery in the 1820s of {{a relationship between the}} force between two <b>current-carrying</b> conductors. This relationship is now known as Ampere's law which can be written ...|$|E
500|$|Ørsted's {{discovery}} in 1821 that {{a magnetic field}} existed around all sides of a wire carrying an electric current {{indicated that there was}} a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. Moreover, the interaction seemed different from gravitational and electrostatic forces, the two forces of nature then known. The force on the compass needle did not direct it to or away from the <b>current-carrying</b> wire, but acted at right angles to it. Ørsted's slightly obscure words were that [...] "the electric conflict acts in a revolving manner." [...] The force also depended on the direction of the current, for if the flow was reversed, then the force did too.|$|E
500|$|The {{impedance}} matrix {{representation of}} a transducer transforms force in the mechanical domain into current in the electrical domain. [...] Likewise, velocity in the mechanical domain is transformed into voltage in the electrical domain. [...] A two-port device that transforms a voltage into an analogous quantity can be represented as a simple transformer. [...] A device that transforms a voltage into an analogue of the dual property of voltage (that is, current, whose analogue is velocity) is represented as a gyrator. [...] Since force is analogous to voltage, not current, this {{may seem like a}} disadvantage on the face of it. [...] However, many practical transducers, especially at audio frequencies, work by electromagnetic induction and are governed by just such a relationship. [...] For instance, the force on a <b>current-carrying</b> conductor is given by, ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{printed circuit}} board [...] {{industry}} defines heavy copper as layers exceeding three ounces of copper, or approximately 0.0042inches (4.2mils, 105μm) thick. [...] PCB designers and fabricators often use heavy copper when design and manufacturing circuit boards {{in order to increase}} <b>current-carrying</b> capacity as well as resistance to thermal strains. Heavy copper-plated vias transfer heat to external heat sinks. IPC 2152 is a standard for determining <b>current-carrying</b> capacity of {{printed circuit board}} traces.|$|E
2500|$|It can {{be shown}} from the Biot-Savart law that {{at one end of}} a semi-infinite <b>current-carrying</b> wire, the {{magnetic}} field at a given perpendicular distance (...) {{from the end of the}} wire is given by: ...|$|E
2500|$|Current {{transformers}} {{permit the}} meter {{to be located}} remotely from the <b>current-carrying</b> conductors. This is common in large installations. For example, a substation serving a single large customer may have metering equipment installed in a cabinet, [...] without bringing heavy cables into the cabinet.|$|E
2500|$|... (in SI units). Variations on {{this basic}} formula {{describe}} the magnetic force on a <b>current-carrying</b> wire (sometimes called Laplace force), the electromotive force in a wire loop moving through {{a magnetic field}} (an aspect of Faraday's law of induction), and the force on a charged particle which might be traveling near {{the speed of light}} (relativistic form of the Lorentz force).|$|E
2500|$|When the {{net force}} on the system is zero, the torque {{measured}} from any point in space is the same. For example, the torque on a <b>current-carrying</b> loop in a uniform magnetic field is the same regardless of your point of reference. If the net force [...] is not zero, and [...] is the torque measured from , then the torque measured from [...] is … ...|$|E
2500|$|The chosen {{reference}} frame determines if an electromagnetic phenomenon {{is viewed as}} an effect of electrostatics or magnetism. [...] Authors usually derive magnetism from electrostatics when special relativity and charge invariance are taken into account. [...] The Feynman Lectures on Physics (vol. 2, ch. 13-6) uses this method to derive the [...] "magnetic" [...] force on a moving charge next to a <b>current-carrying</b> wire. [...] See also Haskell and Landau.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{electrical}} standards vary {{in different}} regions, [...] "customer drops" [...] from the grid {{to the customer}} also {{vary depending on the}} standards and the type of installation. [...] There are several common types of connections between a grid and a customer. [...] Each type has a different metering equation. [...] Blondel's theorem states that for any system with N <b>current-carrying</b> conductors, that N-1 measuring elements are sufficient to measure electrical energy. This indicates that different metering is needed, for example, for a three-phase three-wire system than for a three-phase four-wire (with neutral) system.|$|E
2500|$|The plug used in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea has an {{earthing}} pin and two flat <b>current-carrying</b> pins {{forming an}} upside down V-shape. The flat blades measure [...] and are set at 30° to the vertical at a nominal pitch of [...] Australian and New Zealand wall sockets almost always have switches {{on them for}} extra safety, as in the UK. An unearthed version of this plug with two angled power pins but no earthing pin is used with small double-insulated appliances, but the sockets always include an earth contact.|$|E
2500|$|For {{measurement}} purposes, the Earth {{serves as}} a (reasonably) constant potential reference against which other potentials can be measured. An electrical ground system should have an appropriate <b>current-carrying</b> capability {{to serve as an}} adequate zero-voltage reference level. In electronic circuit theory, a [...] "ground" [...] is usually idealized as an infinite source or sink for charge, which can absorb an unlimited amount of current without changing its potential. Where a real ground connection has a significant resistance, the approximation of zero potential is no longer valid. Stray voltages or earth potential rise effects will occur, which may create noise in signals or if large enough will produce an electric shock hazard.|$|E
2500|$|For metallized film capacitors, {{the maximum}} {{possible}} pulse voltage is limited {{because of the}} limited <b>current-carrying</b> capacity between contact of the electrodes and the electrodes themselves. The rated pulse voltage Vp is the peak value of the pulse voltage which may be applied continuously to a capacitor at the rated temperature and at a given frequency. The pulse voltage capacity is given as pulse voltage rise time dV/dT in V/µs and also implies the maximum pulse current capacity. The values on the pulse rise time refer to the rated voltage. [...] For lower operating voltages, the permissible pulse rise times may decrease. The permissible pulse load capacity of a film capacitor is generally calculated so that an internal temperature rise of 8 to 10°K is acceptable.|$|E
2500|$|An {{understanding}} of the relationship between electricity and magnetism began in 1819 with work by Hans Christian Ørsted, a professor at the University of Copenhagen, who discovered by the accidental twitching of a compass needle near a wire that an electric current could create a magnetic field. [...] This landmark experiment is known as Ørsted's Experiment. [...] Several other experiments followed, with André-Marie Ampère, who in 1820 discovered that the magnetic field circulating in a closed-path was related to the current flowing through the perimeter of the path; Carl Friedrich Gauss; Jean-Baptiste Biot and Félix Savart, both of whom in 1820 came up with the Biot–Savart law giving an equation for the magnetic field from a <b>current-carrying</b> wire; Michael Faraday, who in 1831 found that a time-varying magnetic flux through a loop of wire induced a voltage, and others finding further links between magnetism and electricity. James Clerk Maxwell synthesized and expanded these insights into Maxwell's equations, unifying electricity, magnetism, and optics into the field of electromagnetism. In 1905, Einstein used these laws in motivating his theory of special relativity, requiring that the laws held true in all inertial reference frames.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plug and}} socket used in Class1 {{applications}} in Argentina is defined by IRAM. The applicable standards are: IRAM 2073 [...] "Two pole plugs with earthing contact for domestic and similar purposes, rated 10 A and 20 A, 250 V AC" [...] and IRAM 2071 [...] "Two pole socket—outlets with earthing contact for 10 A and 20 A, 250 V AC., for fixed installations." [...] It is similar in appearance to the Australasian and Chinese plugs. It has an earthing pin and two flat <b>current-carrying</b> pins forming an upside down V-shape (120°). The flat blades for the 10 A version measure [...] and [...] for the 20 A version, and are set at 30° to the vertical at a nominal pitch of [...] The pin length {{is the same as}} in the Chinese version. The earthing pin length is [...] for the 10 A version and [...] for the 20 A version. The poles plugs length is [...] for the 10 A version and [...] for the 20 A version. The most important difference from the Australian plug is that the Argentinian plug is wired with the line and neutral contacts reversed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1800, Alessandro Volta {{invented the}} {{electric}} battery (known of the voltaic pile) and thus improved the way electric currents {{could also be}} studied. A year later, Thomas Young demonstrated the wave nature of light—which received strong experimental support {{from the work of}} Augustin-Jean Fresnel—and the principle of interference. In 1813, Peter Ewart supported the idea of the conservation of energy in his paper On the measure of moving force. In 1820, Hans Christian Ørsted found that a <b>current-carrying</b> conductor gives rise to a magnetic force surrounding it, and within a week after Ørsted's discovery reached France, André-Marie Ampère discovered that two parallel electric currents will exert forces on each other. In 1821, William Hamilton began his analysis of Hamilton's characteristic function. In 1821, Michael Faraday built an electricity-powered motor, while Georg Ohm stated his law of electrical resistance in 1826, expressing the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electric circuit. A year later, botanist Robert Brown discovered Brownian motion: pollen grains in water undergoing movement resulting from their bombardment by the fast-moving atoms or molecules in the liquid. [...] In 1829, Gaspard Coriolis introduced the terms of work (force times distance) and kinetic energy with the meanings they have today.|$|E
2500|$|George H. Scholes Ltd. of Manchester first {{introduced}} plugs with a hollow round earth pin between rectangular <b>current-carrying</b> pins in 1926 under the Wylex brand name, this was {{prior to the}} first British Standard for earthed plugs. [...] The Wylex plugs were initially made in three ratings, 5A, 10A and 15A and were unpolarized (the current carrying pins {{were on the same}} centre line as the earth pin). In 1933 an asymmetric polarized version was introduced, with line pin slightly offset from the centre line. [...] In 1934 the dual plug system was introduced with the socket rated at 15A and three sizes of plug, fused 2A and 5A plugs and a 15A plug. [...] The 15A [...] "dual plug" [...] incorporated a socket with narrower apertures than a standard Wylex 15A socket, that accepted only the narrow rectangular pins of the lower-rated plugs. [...] The introduction of a 13A fused plug, rated as 3kW., enabled Scholes to propose their system as a possible solution for the new standard competing with the Dorman & Smith round pin solution, but it was not selected and the completely new BS1363 design prevailed. [...] Wylex sockets were used in council housing and public sector buildings and, for a short time in private housing. They were particularly popular in the Manchester area although they were installed throughout England, mainly in schools, university accommodation, and government laboratories. In some London schools built in the 1960s they were used as low-voltage AC sockets, typically 12V, 5A from a transformer serving one or more laboratories, for microscope lamps etc. [...] Wylex plugs and sockets continued to be manufactured for several years after BS1363 sockets became standard, and were commonly used by banks and in computer rooms during the 1960s and 1970s for uninterruptible power supplies or [...] "clean" [...] filtered mains supplies.|$|E
