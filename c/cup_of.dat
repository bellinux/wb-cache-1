5|$|Produced by Sara Lee's Douwe Egberts brand, BK Joe was Burger King's coffee {{line that}} was first {{introduced}} in 2001 in North America and later in parts of Europe. Advertised as being made from Arabica coffee, the product was made using Douwe's Cafitesse system, a platform that eschews coffee brewed from ground beans {{in favor of a}} beverage made from a coffee concentrate with hot water added. Sara Lee claims the advantage of the system is that each <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee is made at the time of order with minimal waste and labor. The product was not designed to compete with products from companies such as Starbucks, but was intended to appeal to customers who seek a consistent <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee.|$|E
50|$|A common {{cycle is}} based on the {{addition}} <b>of</b> one <b>cup</b> each <b>of</b> sugar, flour, and milk every five days, with bread baked and extra starter shared every tenth day.

A common suggestion is to bake one loaf of bread, give away three <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> starter, and to save the remaining one for the next cycle.|$|R
