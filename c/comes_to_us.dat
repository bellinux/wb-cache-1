A long trail, a hard trail, maybe; but the call <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> and we have to go. Rooted deep in the nature of every one of us is the spirit of adventure, the call of the wild—vibrating under all our actions, making life deeper and higher and nobler.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after CR 557 joins US 40, {{the road}} enters Buena, Atlantic County and {{continues}} southeast into inhabited areas. After {{running through the}} commercial center of town, the road comes to the southern terminus of Route 54 and {{the eastern end of}} CR 619 in a business area located on the outskirts. At this point, it enters Buena Vista Township, and CR 557 splits form US 40 by heading to the southeast on Buena-Tuckahoe Road. From this point, US 40 becomes concurrent with CR 557 Truck and enters dense woodland containing homes and businesses as well as occasional farms. The road reaches the residential community of Richland, where it encounters the eastern terminus of CR 540 and CR 622 and crosses a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line. Upon leaving Richland, the route crosses into Hamilton Township, where it runs through Mizpah before heading back into forested areas and a few residential sectors. US 40 intersects the eastern terminus of CR 552, briefly becoming a divided highway before turning east into denser inhabited areas. The highway intersects CR 559 Truck/CR 606, at which point it becomes concurrent with CR 559 Truck. The route meets Route 50, where CR 557 Truck splits to the south. Route 50 joins US 40 before the road crosses the Great Egg Harbor River. Upon crossing the river, the road enters Mays Landing and turns north into the downtown area. CR 559 Truck splits southbound to follow CR 617 to the east. A short distance later, the road meets CR 559 and US 40 splits from Route 50 by turning east onto that route. This intersection marks the beginning of CR 559 Truck northbound. The road passes more development before CR 559 splits from the road by heading southeast. US 40 heads east out of Mays Landing, where it continues through woodland and increasing residential development. The road widens into four lanes as it <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> 322 (Black Horse Pike) near the Hamilton Mall. At this point, US 40 forms a concurrency with US 322, which lasts {{for the remainder of the}} route.|$|E

25|$|The {{legend of}} Persephone <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{primarily}} in the anonymous seventh century BC Homeric Hymn To Demeter (Εἲς Δημήτραν),. In the opening scene, the author describes the narcissus, and {{its role as a}} lure to trap the young Persephone.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} surviving mathematical {{treatment of}} regular polygons and polyhedra <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> from ancient Greek mathematicians. The five Platonic solids {{were known to}} them. Pythagoras knew {{of at least three}} of them and Theaetetus (c. 417 BC – 369 BC) described all five. Later, Euclid wrote a systematic study of mathematics, publishing it under the title Elements, which built up a logical theory of geometry and number theory. His work concluded with mathematical descriptions of the five Platonic solids.|$|E
25|$|The first written {{account of}} present-day Alberta <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> from the fur trader Anthony Henday, who {{explored}} {{the vicinity of}} present-day Red Deer and Edmonton in 1754–55. He spent the winter {{with a group of}} Blackfoot, with whom he traded and went buffalo hunting. Other important early explorers of Alberta include Peter Fidler, David Thompson, Peter Pond, Alexander MacKenzie, and George Simpson. The first European settlement was founded at Fort Chipewyan by MacKenzie in 1788, although Fort Vermilion disputes this claim, having also been founded in 1788.|$|E

25|$|To {{create this}} I–Thou {{relationship}} with God, {{a person has}} {{to be open to}} the idea of such a relationship, but not actively pursue it. The pursuit of such a relation creates qualities associated with It‑ness, and so would prevent an I‑You relation, limiting it to I‑It. Buber claims that if we are open to the I–Thou, God eventually <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in response to our welcome. Also, because the God Buber describes is completely devoid of qualities, this I–Thou relationship lasts as long as the individual wills it. When the individual finally returns to the I‑It way of relating, this acts as a barrier to deeper relationship and community.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reference}} to their simple life <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> from the Tasbih of Fatimah, a divine formula that was first given to Fatimah {{when she asked}} her father for a kaneez (servant girl) {{in order to help}} her with household chores. Her father asked her if she would like a gift instead that was better than a servant and worth more than everything in the world. Upon her ready agreement, he told her to recite {{at the end of every}} prayer the Great Exaltation, Allahu Akbar 34 times, the Statement of Absolute Gratitude, Alhamdulillah 33 times and the Invocation of Divine Glory, Subhan'Allah 33 times, totalling 100. This collective prayer is called the Tasbih of Fatima.|$|E

She is [...] "the good fortune that <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{in the form of}} misfortune". Dhumavati embodies the [...] "power of suffering". Through the negative aspects that Dhumavati represents rise the virtues of patience, persistence, forgiveness, and detachment. Without the revealing of this negativity of life, it cannot be transcended and the secret truths would remain hidden under the smoky veil of illusion.|$|E

500|$|The road {{is lined}} with a {{moderate}} amounts of businesses, most with right-in/right-out (RIRO) access, as it continues southeast through Denville, narrowing to four lanes before coming to an interchange with Route 53. [...] From this interchange, the route continues east before curving southeast and entering Mountain Lakes. In Mountain Lakes, US 46 crosses under the Montclair-Boonton Line before continuing into Parsippany-Troy Hills. Here, the road <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> 202/CR 511 before passing under I-287. At this point, the westbound direction of US 46 has a ramp to northbound I-287, with access to and from southbound I-287 provided by US 202. Past the I-287 crossing, the road comes to another partial interchange with I-80 near the western terminus of I-280. Past this interchange, US 46 widens to six lanes and enters Montville. In Montville, the route narrows back to four lanes, and has traffic light-controlled intersections with New Road and Hook Mountain Road/Chapin Road. It then has an interchange with Route 159 and makes a turn to the northeast. Upon crossing the Passaic River at Pine Brook, US 46 enters Essex County into Fairfield Township. A short distance into Essex County, US 46 has another interchange with Route 159 (Clinton Road), providing access to that route and to its continuation as CR 627 (Plymouth Street). Shortly farther along US 46, Route 159 and CR 627 meet it at a traffic light-controlled intersection, providing cross-traffic and turns onto US 46. Past this point, US 46 remains a surface road with RIRO-accessed driveways, but has several intersections controlled by interchanges. Within Fairfield, US 46 has interchanges with Hollywood Avenue and Passaic Avenue {{as well as two}} trumpet interchanges providing access to Fairfield Road, which runs a short distance to the south of US 46.|$|E
2500|$|A {{more recent}} {{empiricism}} {{returns to the}} principle of the English empiricists of the 18th and 19thcenturies, in particular John Stuart Mill, who asserted that all knowledge <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> from observation through the senses.
