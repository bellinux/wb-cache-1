5|$|The American Thermos Bottle Company Laurel Hill Plant is {{historically}} significant {{as the primary}} factory {{for the production of}} Thermos bottles that would allow the company to dominate in the world market.

5|$|The Sun Bowl was not {{the only}} bowl game to involve racial exclusion. Many {{football}} games during the twentieth century affected the integration of collegiate football and sports in general: in addition to Lafayette, there were games played at The University of California, Los Angeles (19381941), Drake University (19481952), Georgia Tech (19541956), and the University of Wyoming (19671970) that led to integrated football games. At the time, these schools conducted studies to monitor the treatment of African American players and how the schools reacted to certain situations involving segregation and prejudice. The teams that were in favor of African Americans participating in football gave players a chance to speak out against the racism {{that took place in the}} sport. As a result of protests and communities <b>coming</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> support black football players, college football slowly became integrated.|$|E

25|$|There is {{also the}} {{extremely}} rare p-p IV branch. Other even-rarer reactions may occur. The rate of these reactions is very low due to very small cross-sections, or {{because the number of}} reacting particles is so low that any reactions that might happen are statistically insignificant.

While the reactions that would produce them, such as a proton + helium-4 producing lithium-5, or two helium-4 nuclei <b>coming</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> form beryllium-8, may actually happen, these elements are not detected because there are no stable isotopes of atomic masses 5 or 8; the resulting products immediately decay into their initial reactants.|$|E

25|$|A compromise, {{contained}} in the Directive, was worked out as follows: worker involvement provisions in the SE will be decided upon by negotiations between employees and management before {{the creation of the}} SE.

25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates <b>coming</b> <b>together</b> <b>to</b> discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E
