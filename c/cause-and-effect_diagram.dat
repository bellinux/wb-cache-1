This view is given by Forte and Power (2007) describing the state of information security {{towards the end of the}} first decade of the 21 st century. Amongst solutions offered, the view that security programs have to be holistic is proposed indicating that technical controls are of little value without the workforce understanding the risks of their irresponsible behavior. Another solution proposed by them is the role of awareness and education. All levels of users should be targeted letting them understand their role and responsibility in information security. Password related behavior is often highlighted as a key component of information security awareness. However, studies have shown that password hygiene is generally poor amongst users (Stanton, Stam, Mastrangelo, & Jolton, 2005).

This paper considers how a different approach to the analysis of variability based on the writings of Walter Shewart and W. Edwards Deming in the area of industrial quality control helps to achieve similar objectives. Statistical process control (SPC) was developed to implement a process of continual product improvement while achieving compliance with production standards and other requirements for promoting customer satisfaction.

These data-analytic procedures can be incorporated into a human service organization to help to achieve its stated objectives in a manner that leads to continuous improvement in the functioning of the clients who are its customers. Examples are provided to illustrate how SPC procedures can be used to analyze behavioral data.
