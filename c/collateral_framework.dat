He argues that [...] "well-functioning monetary and financial systems {{are important to the}} efficient flow of resources and private and social welfare. ... Widespread financial market interventions by central banks have made it difficult to gauge “correct” market prices... This undermines the efficient allocation of resources in the economy.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} inform about {{a feature of}} {{monetary}} policy that is largely overlooked, yet occupies {{a central role in}} modern monetary and financial systems, namely central bank collateral frameworks. Their importance can be understood by the observation that the money at the core of these systems, central bank money, is injected into the economy on terms, not defined in a market, but by the collateral frameworks and interest rate policies of central banks. Using the <b>collateral</b> <b>framework</b> of the Eurosystem as a basis of illustration and case study, the paper brings to light the functioning, reach, and impact of collateral frameworks. A theme that emerges is that collateral frameworks may have distortive effects on financial markets and the wider economy. They can, for example, bias the private provision of real liquidity and thereby also the allocation of resources in the economy as well as contribute to financial instability. Evidence is presented that the <b>collateral</b> <b>framework</b> in the euro area promotes risky and illiquid collateral and, more generally, impairs market forces and discipline.

40|$|Sovereign {{credit risk}} is {{currently}} a significant issue for European banks and over coming years may have implications for global financial stability. This report examines the relationship between sovereign credit risk and bank funding conditions, how banks might respond to an environment of ongoing elevated sovereign risk and the implications for policy makers. It was prepared by a Study Group chaired by Fabio Panetta from the Bank of Italy. The report concludes that increases in sovereign credit risk push up the cost and weaken the composition of banks' funding, and that banks cannot fully insulate themselves by adjusting their operations. As a consequence, the official sector has {{a key role in}} minimising the impact of weaker public finance conditions on banks, but there are trade-offs. First and foremost, governments need to maintain sound public finance conditions. Bank supervisors should also closely monitor the interaction of sovereign risk with regulatory policies that encourage banks to hold large quantities of public debt. Central banks might also consider having flexible <b>collateral</b> <b>frameworks</b> that, during severe crises, allow funding to be supplied against a broad range of collateral, but this is not costless, and hence should be used sparingly and with appropriate safeguards in place. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} role and effects of the <b>collateral</b> <b>framework</b> which central banks, and in {{particular}} the Eurosystem, use in conducting temporary monetary policy operations. First, the paper explains the design of such a framework from the perspective of risk mitigation, which is the purpose of collateralisation. The paper argues that, by means of appropriate risk mitigation measures, the residual risk on any potentially eligible asset can be equalised and brought down to the level consistent with the risk tolerance of the central bank. Once this result has been achieved, eligibility decisions should be based on an economic cost-benefit analysis. Second, the paper looks at the effects of the <b>collateral</b> <b>framework</b> on financial markets, and in particular on spreads between eligible and ineligible assets. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{was written}} by Christopher Weber during his time as a research assistant at the Center for Economic Studies (CES) at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit 4 t (LMU) Munich. It was handed in {{at the department of}} Economics at the LMU Munich in July 2016. The goal of the thesis is to establish the configuration of collateral policy as a tool of central bank policies in pursuit of different objectives, and to present collateral policies in practice, as well as impact and effects of collateral policy. The thesis consists of three parts and nine chapters. The first part discusses the role of collateral in central bank policy. Possible tasks and objectives of central banks are historically deduced in order to then integrate the configuration of collateral policy into the system of objectives. Collateral policy emerges as of relevance towards all central bank objectives. As a result, a normative framework for the role of collateral policy is developed. In the second part, practical collateral policy measures are presented along the lines of this framework. The focus is on the collateral policy of the Eurosystem, which is presented in detail. It has been intensified with respect to several central bank objectives throughout the financial and the European debt crisis. A comparison is made to historical collateral policy measures, as well as the configuration of the <b>collateral</b> <b>frameworks</b> at the Fed, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan during the recent crisis years. The third part starts with a theoretical foundation of the impact and transmission process of collateral policy within the system of objectives of a central bank. Collateral policy is therefore differentiated into haircut policy and quantity policy and contrasted to classical interest rate policy. The optimal collateral policy with respect to distinct central bank objectives is derived...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive overview of Canada’s Large Value Transfer System (LVTS). The LVTS is a real-time electronic system for handling large-value payments {{and is an}} integral component of the country’s financial system.

The paper explains how {{the design of the}} LVTS, including its risk-control <b>framework,</b> <b>collateral</b> arrangements, and loss-allocation procedures in the event of participant default, exceeds the risk-containment requirements of the international Core Principles for Systemically Important Payments Systems. At the same time, the LVTS offers a more cost-efficient means of sending payments relative to standard Real-time Gross Settlement arrangements. This is facilitated by the availability of several liquidity-saving features, each of which is described.

40|$|Pancreatic ductal {{adenocarcinoma}} (PDAC) {{or simply}} pancreatic cancer {{is one of}} the most lethal of all solid tumors with a relatively unchanged dismal prognosis despite decades of efforts. Surrounded by a dense fibrotic stroma, pancreatic tumor cells acquire genetic mutations and reprogrammed metabolism to survive the stress imposed by the hypoxic, oxygen- and nutrient-deprived microenvironment. Cancer-primed activated stromal cells, pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), of the tumor microenvironment promote cancer growth by enabling immune-suppression, metastasis and chemo-resistance. In chapter 1 of this manuscript, we present an overview of PDAC biology, statistics, altered metabolism and the limitations associated with the current standard of care. In Chapter 2, we propose a novel combinatorial treatment to normalize PDAC stroma and recapitulate PSCs and CAFs quiescence. We show that treatment can enhance chemo-drug intratumoral delivery and can successfully halt tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. We next show in chapter 3 that activated and treatment-induced quiescent stromal cells exhibit differential metabolic profiles whereby quiescent stromal cells are associated with reduced Warburg Effect and lower oxidative and reductive glutamine metabolism. In addition to stromal targeting, we show in chapter 4 how the metabolic gene malic enzyme (ME) 2 provides a <b>collateral</b> lethality <b>framework</b> in PDAC that can be explored to directly target cancer epithelial cells. We provide evidence supporting that the selective targeting of ME 3, a ME 2 isoform, could be used as a novel strategy for the therapeutic treatment of a genotype-specific subset of PDAC patients. We conclude this manuscript with chapter 5 in which we propose future studies and present directions towards finding a cure for pancreatic cancer. In summary, we provide evidence that normalizing pancreatic stroma and targeting cancer-specific altered metabolic pathways could present viable therapies for PDAC treatment...|$|R

40|$|Basel III {{introduces}} for {{the first}} time an international framework for liquidity risk regulation, reflecting the experience of excessive liquidity risk taking of banks in the run up to the financial crisis that erupted in August 2007, and associated negative externalities. As central banks {{play a crucial role in}} the liquidity provision to banks during normal times and in a financial crisis, the treatment of central bank operations in the regulation is obviously important. To ensure internalisation of liquidity risks (i. e. pricing of liquidity risk) and to address excessive reliance ex ante on central bank liquidity support by the banks, the regulation deliberately does not establish a direct close link with the monetary policy operational framework. While this reflects the purpose of the regulation and is also natural outcome of an international rule being applied under a multitude of very different monetary policy operational frameworks, this paper shows that the interaction between the two areas can be substantial, depending on the operational and <b>collateral</b> <b>framework</b> of the central bank. This implies the need for further study and the development of policies at the central bank and regulatory/supervisory side on how to handle these potential interactions in practice.

40|$|Objectives of the study: The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to discuss the policy options of a central bank in a financial crisis from the viewpoint of monetary policy implementation. The aim is to recognize the scenarios in which a central bank ought to resort to unconventional monetary policy measures. Furthermore, the study pursues to provide a general overview and assessment of the effectiveness of the European Central Bank's (ECB) crisis response during the financial crisis, mostly from the financial markets' perspective. Moreover, the paper entails an event study on the market effects of the ECB's announcements on some of its unconventional monetary policy measures. Results: The literature review concludes that there are two scenarios under which a central bank should conduct unconventional monetary policy measures. Firstly, unconventional measures are warranted when an economy is heading towards a deflationary spiral or a liquidity trap. Secondly, these measures are warranted when the monetary policy transmission mechanism is impaired. As the transmission mechanism consists of several channels an impairment of any of these channels can require a central bank response. A general overview of the key measures finds that, during the crisis, the ECB has mainly addressed problems in monetary policy transmission whereas disinflationary pressures have only started to mount recently. In order to support the monetary policy transmission, the ECB has adopted a more passive role in liquidity management by providing liquidity to the banking system in a more flexible manner than before. It has extended the maturities of its refinancing operations and relaxed some eligibility criteria in its <b>collateral</b> <b>framework.</b> The ECB has also provided liquidity in foreign currencies. In addition, it has conducted outright asset purchases and committed to Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT). The event study finds that the OMT announcement had an immediate and significant effect on stabilization of the euro area sovereign bond while the same cannot be said about the three-year longer-term liquidity providing operations. The great success of the OMT shows that a central bank backstop is needed in a financial crisis and that a credible commitment from the central bank to support the financial system can at times have even a larger impact than outright measures...|$|E
