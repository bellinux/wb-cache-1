5|$|Based upon {{scientific}} research <b>conducted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Hurricane Research Division in 2003, the cyclone {{is estimated to}} have first begun as a 60mph (100km/h) tropical storm south of Mayaguana in the Bahamas early on September9. However, due to scarce observations, its genesis likely occurred earlier than this time but was undetected operationally. Moving slowly northwest, the cyclone quickly strengthened into a hurricane with winds of 75mph (120km/h), equivalent to Category1 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, early the next day. By 00:00UTC on September11, it reached sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) while centered about 15miles (25km) west of New Providence Island. Turning to the west-northwest, the cyclone maintained its intensity while passing {{just north of the}} Bimini Islands. Around 23:00UTC on September12, the cyclone struck South Florida near Fort Lauderdale with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Thereafter, the hurricane weakened upon crossing the Everglades, weakening to a tropical storm at 06:00UTC on September12.|$|E

After that moment, public displays of support for Antonescu became illegal. Antonescu's SMERSH interrogations were recovered from the Russian archives and published in 2006.

The vote's knockout phase included televised profiles of the ten most popular figures, and saw historian Adrian Cioroianu using the portion dedicated to Antonescu to expose and condemn him, giving voters reasons not to see the dictator as a great Romanian. The approach resulted in notable controversy after Ziua newspaper criticized Cioroianu, who defended himself by stating he had an obligation to tell the truth.|$|E
