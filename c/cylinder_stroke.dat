25|$|In 1973 in the United States and Canada, and 1975 in {{the rest}} of the world, the 1500 engine was used to make the Spitfire 1500. Although in this final {{incarnation}} the engine was rather rougher and more prone to failure than the earlier units, torque was greatly increased by increasing the <b>cylinder</b> <b>stroke</b> to , which made it much more drivable in traffic.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the systems}} used {{elsewhere}} in Europe, the German tax horsepower calculation took account {{both of the}} cylinder bore and of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>stroke,</b> and there was therefore a direct linear relationship between engine size and tax horsepower.|$|E
50|$|The NER Class P1 (LNER Class J25) was a {{class of}} 0-6-0 steam {{locomotives}} of the North Eastern Railway. Class P1 was a development of Class P, having a boiler four inches longer, and a firebox six inches longer. To accommodate these, the wheelbase was increased by nine inches. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>stroke</b> was also increased by two inches.|$|E

50|$|The full four seater {{arrived in}} January with the 1204 {{which had its}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>stroke</b> {{extended}} from 61 mm to 73 mm, to give an engine capacity of 1,189 cc and claimed maximum power of 39 kW (53 PS) at 5,100 rpm. The larger engined car was also offered as a coupé and as a cabriolet.|$|E
50|$|In Germany tax horsepower, {{which had}} been defined by statute since 1906, {{was based on the}} {{dimensions}} of the cylinders in the engine. Unlike the systems used elsewhere in Europe, the German tax horsepower calculation took account both of the cylinder bore and of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>stroke,</b> and there was therefore a direct linear relationship between engine size and tax horsepower.|$|E

5000|$|The 1.2-litre unit that, in the Kadett B, {{replaced}} in August 1971 the higher-compression {{versions of the}} 1.1-litre motor was listed as the [...] "1200 S" [...] motor.

50|$|The C-5 was a {{development}} of the earlier R-5 with greater power and dimensions. The main change was the increase in cylinder bore from 128 mm (5.0 in) to 143 mm (5.625 in) {{and an increase in}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>stroke</b> from 140 mm (5.5 in) to 145 mm (5.75 in). This led to a corresponding increase in displacement from 8.85 liters (540 cu in) to 11.71 liters (715 cu in).|$|E
50|$|Many {{deficiencies}} {{with aging}} design became {{apparent in the}} 1960s, including a tendency of the connecting rods to fail at high rpms due to the long <b>cylinder</b> <b>stroke</b> of the engine. As the average speed of the vehicles in the military increased, these engine failures became commonplace due to the low gear ratio of the vehicle, which was originally designed as a multipurpose vehicle capable of transporting heavy loads of ammunition.|$|E

5000|$|The 2361 Class is {{sometimes}} described, erroneously, as the [...] "outside-framed {{version of the}} Dean Goods". While {{it is true that}} there is a superficial resemblance, above the running plate; that the 2361s likewise have 5 ft diameter wheels; and that they are numbered in the same sequence; they are nevertheless a quite separate class, having a longer <b>cylinder</b> <b>stroke,</b> larger boiler, longer wheelbase, and consequently greater tractive effort.|$|E
50|$|The {{builders}} {{chose not}} {{to adhere to the}} original designs and specifications. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>stroke</b> was reduced to 20 in and two inner cylinders of the same dimensions were added to drive the rack mechanism independently. A plate frame was used instead of the specified bar frame. The main plate frames were 1+1/4 in thick and were arranged outside the coupled wheels. The balanced flat slide valves were actuated by Joy valve gear.|$|E

50|$|Thunderer was {{the first}} of a pair of steam {{locomotives}} (the other being Hurricane) built for the Great Western Railway (GWR), England, by R. & W. Hawthorn & Co. whose design was very different from other locomotives. In order to meet Isambard Kingdom Brunel's strict specifications, an 0-4-0 frame carried the 'engine', while the boiler was on a separate six-wheeled frame. The driving wheels were geared 10:27 {{in order to reduce the}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>stroke</b> speed while allowing high track speed, in line with the specifications.|$|E
50|$|Having {{raised the}} final drive {{and the top}} speed for 1927, the {{manufacturer}} now moved to offer a choice of ratios, either reducing it back to 5.4 :1 or raising it further to 5.8 :1. The former ratio was described as the “Flachland” (flat lands) version while the latter as the “Berg” (mountain) version. At {{the same time a}} small increase in the <b>cylinder</b> <b>stroke</b> accounted for an increase in overall engine capacity to 3,131 cc. Claimed maximum output was unchanged at , still at 3,200, although there was a measurable increase in torque.|$|E
50|$|Snake and Viper {{were built}} at the Haigh Foundry in 1838 with 14.75 x 18 in {{cylinders}} and the driving wheels geared 2:3 {{in order to keep}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>stroke</b> speed low while allowing high track speed, in line with Brunel's specifications. Within a couple of years they had been rebuilt with 13 x 18 in and conventional drive. They were later converted to 2-2-2T tank locomotives, possibly when they were sent to work the South Devon Railway, and at some time fitted with 6 ft driving wheels and 15 x 18 in cylinders.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} Exel {{is powered}} by an 18 hp (13.4 kW) JPX D-320 flat twin, two-stroke engine, driving a two bladed pusher carbon fibre propeller which can be folded so both blades point aft for gliding flight. Optionally, a 21 kW (28 hp) Hirth F-33 single <b>cylinder</b> two <b>stroke</b> engine, a four-stroke Briggs & Stratton 21 kW (28 hp) or a Zenoah G-25 [...] single <b>cylinder</b> two <b>stroke</b> powerplant may be fitted. A ballistic recovery parachute is another option.|$|R
