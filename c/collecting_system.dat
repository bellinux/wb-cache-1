The provincial government had also invested government funds in various enterprises, many of which were poorly managed. Wang ordered a review of government-sponsored firms. From 1918 revenues rose steadily, and by 1921 all outstanding loans had been repaid and there was even a budget surplus. Wang was rewarded by being appointed Civil Governor of Fengtian province while remaining Director of the Bureau of Finance. He retained the title of Military Governor of Fengtian. Still, {{more than two-thirds of the}} budget was allocated to the military.|$|E

2500|$|Moreton {{proposes a}} pragmatic scheme (already {{in use in}} the parish of St. Giles in the Fields) for a more {{effective}} night watch. This should be [...] "composed of stout able-bodied men", arranged in a sufficient number, one every forty houses [...] "for it is observable that a man can not well see distinctly beyond the extent of twenty houses in a row". To avoid any possible abuse or misapplication {{in the distribution of}} the public money, Moreton suggests that the watch should be elected and paid by the householders themselves through an arranged rating and <b>collecting</b> <b>system,</b> and their annual wage should be increased to 20 pound, so that [...] "a poor man, who with frugality may live decently thereon". Furthermore, watchmen should be adequately armed with firearms and swords in order to dispose of an efficient mean to prevent crime and to protect their person if needed. They should also be equipped with a lantern and a horn to sound the alarm.|$|E
2500|$|Surgery is {{increasingly}} performed via laparoscopic techniques. [...] Commonly {{referred to as}} key hole surgery, this surgery {{does not have the}} large incisions seen in a classically performed radical or partial nephrectomy, but still successfully removes either {{all or part of the}} kidney. Laparoscopic surgery is associated with shorter stays in the hospital and quicker recovery time but there are still risks associated with the surgical procedure. These have the advantage of being less of a burden for the patient and the disease-free survival is comparable to that of open surgery. [...] For small exophytic lesions that do not extensively involve the major vessels or urinary <b>collecting</b> <b>system,</b> a partial nephrectomy (also referred to as [...] "nephron sparing surgery") can be performed. [...] This may involve temporarily stopping blood flow to the kidney while the mass is removed as well as renal cooling with an ice slush. Mannitol can also be administered to help limit damage to the kidney. [...] This is usually done through an open incision although smaller lesions can be done laparoscopically with or without robotic assistance.|$|E

2500|$|The {{life cycle}} of F. magna is {{relatively}} complex and {{is similar to the}} development of the related fluke, F. hepatica. A detailed account of the F. magna life cycle was given by Swales (1935), Erhardová-Kotrlá (1971), and reviewed by Pybus (2001).Adult flukes occur in pairs or groups within a fibrous [...] in the liver parenchyma of the definitive host. Mature flukes release eggs which are collected in the cavity of the capsule. The capsule contains a great mass of eggs and has duct connections to bile ducts. The eggs are passed together with bile into the bile <b>collecting</b> <b>system,</b> enter the small intestine, and leave the definitive host along with the faeces. The eggs which are passed out in the faeces into the environment are undeveloped and undergo embryonation outside the host. Several physical-chemical factors, especially temperature, humidity and oxygen tension, are known to influence embryonation. During the embryonation of the egg, a larva called a miracidium develops from germinal cells. Fully developed miracidium releases the operculum of the egg using several proteases. The embryonation period varies from 27 to 44 days in natural conditions. Ciliated miracidia hatch in water and actively seek suitable intermediate hosts that are freshwater snails from family Lymnaeidae. After attaching to a suitable snail host, the miracidium penetrates into the snail body. After shedding its ciliated cell layer it is called a sporocyst. The sporocysts are found in the foot, the snail body, digestive glands, reproductive organs, and in the pulmonary sac of the snail. The sporocysts contain germinal cells that give rise to 1-6 mother rediae (a trematode larval form with an oral sucker). Developed mother rediae are released from the sporocyst and migrate into digestive glands, renal organ, reproductive organs, and pulmonary sac of the snail body. Each mother redia can asexually produce up to 10 daughter rediae. However, only 3 to 6 daughter rediae complete their development and leave the mother rediae. In turn, each daughter redia may produce 1-6 Trematode lifecycle stages#Typical lifecyle stagescercariae in experimentally infected snails and 16-22 cercariae under natural conditions. Cercariae emerge from the rediae and mature usually in digestive glands of the snail. Mature cercarie spontaneously emerge from the snail host and swim actively in water for up to two hours before encysting on vegetation. After encystment the flukes are called metacercariae. Development within the snail takes 40 to 69 days depending upon the temperature and the species of snail. The definitive host ingests vegetation containing the metacercariae. In the stomach and the intestine, the metacercariae are stimulated to emerge from the cyst (excystation). Newly excysted juvenile flukes penetrate the wall of the intestine and migrate in the abdominal cavity. Juvenile flukes penetrate the Glisson’s capsule of the liver and continue migrating in the liver tissue. Rarely juvenile flukes penetrate other organs, such as lungs or kidneys. In these organs, however, flukes do not survive and not attain maturity. In the liver, flukes migrate within the parenchyma to search another fluke. If the fluke meet another one, they stop moving, and the fibrous capsule is formed around them. In the capsule, the parasite completes its development and starts egg-laying. Prepatent period varies 3–7 months and is dependent on host species. Adult F. magna can survive in the liver of the host up to 7 years.|$|E
