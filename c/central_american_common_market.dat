40|$|For {{nearly two}} centuries, the U. S. Constitution through the dormant Commerce Clause has {{protected}} the <b>American</b> <b>common</b> <b>market</b> from protectionist commercial stale regulations and taxes. During {{the past two}} terms, however, the U. S. Supreme Court created a new exception to the dormant Commerce Clause for protectionist {{state and local taxes}} and regulations that favor public rather than private entities. In this Article, we describe this “New Protectionism” and argue that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s embrace of it is profoundly misguided. As we document, there is no material difference, economically or constitutionally, between public protectionism and private protectionism. As illustrated by the variety of ways in which government and private enterprise interact, there is no coherent distinction between public and private activities, and ensuing efforts to draw such a line will only serve to embroil the courts in tasks for which it is ill suited. Worse, this new exception only encourages stale and focal governments to engage in protectionism in a variety of contexts, such as education and local economic development, in which the dangers to national economic union are paramount. Coupled with the Court 2 ̆ 7 s recently declared unwillingness to subject nondiscriminatory regulations and loses to minimal judicial scrutiny, this endorsement of public protectionism threatens to emasculate the constitutional protections for the <b>American</b> <b>common</b> <b>market</b> and should therefore be rethought by the Court or legislatively superseded by Congress.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} undocumented immigration to the United States from Mexico, and current and proposed policies designed to control these undocumented flows.

For each alternative, I predict likely outcomes and distributional consequences for seven types of actors (U. S. workers, U. S. consumers, U. S. employers, other U.

Though civil society groups have presented SSE as a new economic paradigm, regional policy frameworks have implemented it as an add-on-or complement-to dominant capitalist economies. This has happened in two key ways: (i) the SSE sector, and cooperatives in particular, are cast as drivers of regional integration and socioeconomic policy, although a limited involvement in major integration projects represents missed opportunities for SSE to be mainstreamed; and (ii) despite SSE policy being portrayed as a sort of intervention that combines social and economic policies, its implementation almost exclusively by ministers of social development means that it is institutionally limited to the realm of poverty eradication rather than a restructuring of the dominant economy. SSE is also fiscally dependent on dominant industries, which-in the end-does not reverse or challenge the ongoing process of economic centralization in key sector...|$|R

40|$|The United States Constitution commits the United States to a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> system, yet, unfortunately, {{the nature}} {{and scope of the}} <b>American</b> <b>common</b> <b>market</b> have been incompletely — and, at times, inconsistently — {{described}} by the U. S. Supreme Court. This Article provides an original, theoretical account of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to national economic union. As I argue, the central constitutional commitment is one of deliberative equality — that is, states and localities may regulate or tax interstate commerce if and only if the government gives equal regard to similarly situated in-state and out-of-state interests burdened by the regulation or tax. Deliberative equality provides a powerful normative justification for the judicial review of state measures that inhibit interstate trade. Yet, at the same time, deliberative equality provides ample room for states to respond to public policy issues in divergent ways consistent with the desires of the local citizenry. In this way, deliberative equality offers a superior theoretical foundation than alternative theories embraced by the Court, which overemphasize either free trade or state regulatory autonomy. The relative superiority of deliberative equality and the defects in the alternative approaches are both illustrated by the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent decisions involving the states 2 ̆ 7 power to regulate commerce, which inject further confusion into an area already in need of analytical clarity.
