5|$|Between April and May 1996, Hoffman {{appeared}} at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in a Mark Wing-Davey production of Caryl Churchill's The Skriker. Following this, based on his work in Scent of a Woman, he was cast by writer–director Paul Thomas Anderson to appear in his debut feature Hard Eight (1996). Hoffman had only a brief role in the crime thriller, playing a cocksure young craps player, but it began the most important <b>collaboration</b> <b>of</b> his career.|$|E
5|$|Brunei {{received}} {{an invitation from}} the Tripartite Commission to send a badminton player in the men's singles event, signifying the nation's Olympic debut in the sport.

Jaspar Yu Woon Chai participated in the men's singles event. Yu was seeded in group D together with Hu Yun of Hong Kong and Pablo Abián of Spain. Yu lost both sets against Hu on 12 August, the first 16–21 and the second 15–21. The following day, Yu also lost both sets against Abián. The first was 12–21 and the second 10–21. Hu went on to beat Abián on 14 August with two close sets, the former 21–18 and the latter 21–19.|$|E
5|$|Finland sought {{security}} guarantees {{from the}} League of Nations, {{but did not}} have high expectations. Sweden {{was one of the}} founding members of the League, and consequently framed its military policies based on the League's principles of disarmament and sanctions. In the mid-1920s the Finns established a special planning committee, called the Committee of Erich after its chairman Rafael Erich, which consisted of top politicians and officers, with the aim of exploring a possible military <b>collaboration</b> <b>of</b> Finland with other nations. The prime goal was co-operation with the Scandinavian countries, amongst which Sweden was the most important prospective partner.|$|E

While they did not recognise the experiments synthesising 287Mc and 288Mc as persuasive {{due to the lack of}} a convincing identification of atomic number via cross-reactions, they recognised the 293Ts experiments as persuasive because its daughter 289Mc had been produced independently and found to exhibit the same properties.|$|E
5|$|Lukather's {{reputation}} as a guitarist and his association with Paich and Jeff Porcaro, who also became established artists, allowed him to secure a solid flow of session work in the 1970s and 1980s. Lukather has been nominated for twelve Grammy Awards, and has won five. While his work with Toto was predominantly based on pop rock music and his solo work ventures into progressive rock and hard rock, many of Lukather's side-projects are focused on jazz fusion. He held a long-time collaboration with jazz guitarist Larry Carlton that produced a Grammy-winning live album, {{and he was a}} member of the jazz fusion band Los Lobotomys, a <b>collaboration</b> <b>of</b> notable session musicians.|$|E

5|$|Of the 240 {{people killed}} during the storm, 135 were workers on the Florida East Coast Railway. The {{hurricane}} {{eventually led to the}} end of pineapple production in the Florida Keys for commercial purposes in 1915, although this was amplified by two further hurricanes in the following years. In 1947, Project Cirrus, a <b>collaboration</b> <b>of</b> the United States Air Force, attempted to modify a hurricane; however, the seeded storm made a sudden re-curvature and came ashore near Charleston, South Carolina. As a result, several lawsuits were filed, although they were denied after the path of this storm was revealed to have been similar to the 1906 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the film's release, July 12, 2013, another {{viral video}} was {{released}} to promote the film.

It featured members of the YouTube network (such as the Game Grumps) as Jaeger pilots fighting Kaiju. On July 16, a novelization by Alex Irvine was released. NECA began selling action figures of the film's Kaiju and Jaegers.|$|E
5|$|The Dubna team {{repeated}} the experiment in 2012, creating seven atoms of element 117 and confirming their earlier synthesis of element 118 (produced {{after some time}} when a significant quantity of the berkelium-249 target had beta decayed to californium-249). The results of the experiment matched the previous outcome; the scientists then filed an application to register the element. In May 2014, a joint German–American <b>collaboration</b> <b>of</b> scientists from the ORNL and the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany, claimed to have confirmed discovery of the element. The team {{repeated the}} Dubna experiment using the Darmstadt accelerator, creating two atoms of element 117.|$|E

5|$|The {{enormous}} task which Gaudí faced, not {{in terms}} of the number of works, but in terms of their complexity, required the <b>collaboration</b> <b>of</b> a large number of assistants, artists, architects and craftsmen.

A test of his expertise both in his field and in interpersonal communication was demonstrated in bringing together a large number of diverse professionals and creating an integrated team.|$|E
5|$|Wright's {{adaptation}} {{failed to}} have the same cultural impact as the 1995 serial and has since attracted sharply-divided opinions. However, even three years after the release, Knightley was still associated with Elizabeth Bennet among a generation of young viewers who had not seen the 1995 production. Given the varied opinions about the film, JASNA published an edited special issue of its online journal Persuasions On-Line in 2007 with the <b>collaboration</b> <b>of</b> nineteen Austen scholars from six countries; the intent was to foster discussion and stimulate scholarly analysis. JASNA had done this only once before, for the 1996 film Emma.|$|E
