It involves dramatic changes in chromatin organization as well as gene expression. In the present report we used cell flow cytometry and genome wide DNA combing to investigate DNA replication during murine erythroleukemia-induced terminal cell differentiation.

40|$|The {{volume of}} single premium {{payments}} (with long-run guarantees) almost halved in 2016. Positive {{effects of the}} tax reform were more than compensated by low interest rates, making private households increasingly shy away from contracts with long <b>commitment</b> <b>periods.</b> On the supply side, insurers were less willing to underwrite long-run guarantees. This caused premiums in the life insurance business to decline by 9 percent and the total premium intake to shrink by 1. 8 percent. Robustly growing private health insurance (+ 4. 7 percent) and a recovery in non-life and accident insurance (+ 1. 7 percent) did not prevent a further drop of the insurance density to 4. 9 percent of GDP.

25|$|The Berlin mandate was {{recognized}} in the Kyoto Protocol in that developing countries were not subject to emission reduction commitments in the first Kyoto <b>commitment</b> <b>period.</b> However, the large potential for growth in developing country emissions made negotiations on this issue tense.

The general assumption was that developing countries would face quantitative commitments in later commitment periods, and at the same time, developed countries would meet their first round commitments.|$|E
25|$|Between 2001, {{which was}} the first year Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) {{projects}} could be registered, and 2012, {{the end of the first}} Kyoto <b>commitment</b> <b>period,</b> the CDM is expected to produce some 1.5billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in emission reductions. Most of these reductions are through renewable energy commercialisation, energy efficiency, and fuel switching (World Bank, 2010, p.262). By 2012, the largest potential for production of CERs are estimated in China (52% of total CERs) and India (16%). CERs produced in Latin America and the Caribbean make up 15% of the potential total, with Brazil as the largest producer in the region (7%).|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) {{noted that}} it {{expected}} New Zealand {{to be able to}} increase emissions and comply with the Kyoto Protocol, and make an economic gain.

MFAT predicted that New Zealand would emit between 50 and 75 million tonnes of greenhouse gases more than the 365 million tonnes of the initial assigned amount during the first <b>commitment</b> <b>period.</b> However, MFAT considered that the increase in emissions would be offset by about 110 million Removal Units (RMU) originating from forests planted from 1990 onwards (post-1989 forests.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Following recent discussions, {{there is}} hope that a {{mechanism}} for reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) will be agreed by the Parties of the UNFCCC at their 15 th meeting in Copenhagen in 2009 as an eligible action to prevent climate changes and global warming in post- 2012 <b>commitment</b> <b>periods.</b> Countries introducing a REDD-regime in order to generate benefits need to implement sound monitoring and reporting systems and specify the associated uncertainties. The principle of conservativeness addresses the problem of estimation errors and requests the reporting of reliable minimum estimates (RME). Here the potential to generate benefits from applying a REDD-regime is proposed with reference to sampling and non-sampling errors that influence the reliability of estimated activity data and emission factors. Results A framework for calculating carbon benefits by including assessment errors is developed. Theoretical, sample based considerations {{as well as a}} simulation study for five selected countries with low to high deforestation and degradation rates show that even small assessment errors (5 % and less) may outweigh successful efforts to reduce deforestation and degradation. Conclusion The generation of benefits from REDD is possible only in situations where assessment errors are carefully controlled. </p...|$|R

40|$|Simultaneity between <b>commitment</b> <b>periods</b> (2008 - 2012) of International Emissions Trading (IET) {{scheme and}} EUropean Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) {{is likely to}} {{generate}} distortions in terms of burden’s distribution among sectors. There will be two levels of trading: a country and an entity level, which both need {{to be consistent with}} each other. Besides, features of these two “cap and trade " emissions trading schemes are not the same. Thus, to reach international targets, each European government will have to adopt an additional environmental policy concerning sectors only covered by the IET. This policy may consist in implementing a tax rate on emissions of these latter sectors. The level of such a tax will depend on the effort realized within the European market. Indeed, if the domestic objective is low (within EU-ETS), then sectors only included in the Kyoto program will have to support {{the main part of the}} environmental constraint. We propose in this article a modeling of this two-level environmental policy, focusing on the additional tax rate, introducing several cases of linkages.
