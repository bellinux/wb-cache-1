40|$|We {{detected}} <b>circulating</b> {{plasma cells}} (PCs) by flow cytometry in 302 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) by gating on CD 38 +CD 45 - cells. The number of <b>circulating</b> PCs per 50 000 mononuclear cells was reported. In 80 (27 %) patients, no <b>circulating</b> PC were seen; 106 (35 %) patients had 1 to 10 and 115 (38 %) patients {{had more than}} 10 <b>circulating</b> PCs. Median overall survival for the 302 patients was 47 months. Patients with 10 or fewer <b>circulating</b> PCs had a median survival of 58. 7 months, whereas patients with more than 10 <b>circulating</b> PCs had a median survival of 37. 3 months (P =. 001). On multivariate analysis, the prognostic value of <b>circulating</b> PCs was independent of β 2 -microglobulin, albumin, and C-reactive protein. There was only a weak correlation between tumor mass and <b>circulating</b> PCs, suggesting that the appearance of <b>circulating</b> PCs may be a reflection of tumor biology. We conclude {{that the number of}} <b>circulating</b> PCs measured by flow cytometry in patients with newly diagnosed MM is an independent predictor of survival...|$|R

30|$|The {{equivalent}} output impedances of {{the parallel}} inverters {{are different from}} each other at PCC [59] in an AC or hybrid microgrid since the control strategies, filter parameters and length of transmission lines [60], are not the same. Consequently, it will cause the fundamental and harmonic <b>circulating</b> currents, and also the fluctuations of the amplitude and frequency of the PCC voltage of the islanded microgrid [61, 62]. There have three types of <b>circulating</b> currents in the islanded mode, i.e., active <b>circulating</b> current, reactive <b>circulating</b> current and harmonic <b>circulating</b> current. The active <b>circulating</b> current is caused by the frequency and phase deviations of inverter output voltages. The reactive <b>circulating</b> current results from the magnitude deviations of inverter output voltages. The harmonic <b>circulating</b> current is the result of harmonic components of inverter output voltages. The slight deviations of the frequency, phase and magnitude of the inverter output voltages will lead to large fundamental or harmonic <b>circulating</b> currents [63]. Moreover, the <b>circulating</b> currents will reduce the output capacities of the DG units, and increase the line losses, also endanger the safe operation of the microgrid [64, 65].|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the article}} lies in revelation of {{possibilities}} of increase of efficiency of managing enterprise <b>circulating</b> funds by means of improvement of their classification features.

40|$|Zonulin is {{the only}} {{physiological}} mediator known to regulate intestinal permeability reversibly by modulating intercellular tight junctions. To investigate the relationship between intestinal permeability and obesity-associated metabolic disturbances in humans, we aimed to study <b>circulating</b> zonulin according to obesity and insulin resistance. <b>Circulating</b> zonulin (ELISA) was measured in 123 caucasian men in association with inflammatory and metabolic parameters (including minimal model-measured insulin sensitivity). <b>Circulating</b> zonulin increased with body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), fasting insulin, fasting triglycerides, uric acid and IL- 6, and negatively correlated with HDL-cholesterol and insulin sensitivity. In multiple regression analysis, insulin sensitivity (p = 0. 002) contributed independently to <b>circulating</b> zonulin variance, after controlling {{for the effects of}} BMI, fasting triglycerides and age. When <b>circulating</b> IL- 6 was added to this model, only BMI (p = 0. 01) contributed independently to <b>circulating</b> zonulin variance.

Molecular hybridization showed significant homology of the various <b>circulating</b> DNA examined, only with human genomic DNA, but limited cross-reactivity among <b>circulating</b> DNA from different individuals.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the <b>circulating</b> current {{measurement}} of a STAtic synchronous COMpensator (STATCOM) based on Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC).

Thus, this work evaluates three <b>circulating</b> current measurement strategies, with focus on the converter characteristics improvement, such as losses reduction. A classical strategy is compared with other two strategies using a Second Order Generalized Integrator (SOGI) structure. The first proposed strategy eliminates the third harmonic from the <b>circulating</b> current and the second detects the fundamental component of the <b>circulating</b> current eliminating the other harmonic components. Simulated and experimental results show that this strategies achieve reduction in the <b>circulating</b> current, and consequently reduction in the STATCOM losses...|$|R
