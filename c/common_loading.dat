40|$|Patient-specific {{simulations}} of bone remodelling could enable predicting how bone micro-structural integrity {{would be affected}} by bone diseases, drugs or other factors, and, ultimately could help clinicians to improve their prognoses. To simulate load-adaptive remodelling, however, knowledge about the physiological external loading acting on the bone is required. Assuming that load adaptation leads to homogeneous tissue loading, we previously developed a method to estimate the physiological loading history from bone micro-structural morphology. We were able to reconstruct the loading history of a simple load case that was applied in an animal experiment. However, we found considerable inhomogeneity in tissue loading suggesting that the bones were not fully adapted. Also, we noted differences in bone micro-architecture between animals despite <b>common</b> <b>loading</b> history, possibly due to differences caused by the stochastic nature of the bone remodelling process. In the present study, we aim at validating the load estimation algorithm in a well-controlled environment in which more complicated loading conditions are applied. Specifically, we want to test its accuracy for partially and fully developed bone structures and for differences in bone micro-architectures as they can occur due to stochastic events, even for bones with a <b>common</b> <b>loading</b> history. This was possible by using synthetic micro-architectures obtained from bone remodelling simulations as the basis for our load estimation algorithm. Loading histories based on fully adapted structures were predicted with a maximum error of 4. 4 % and predictions were not affected by differences in bone micro-architecture. These results show that our load estimation algorithm produces reasonable predictions and might be a suitable tool to define in vivo loading for patient-specific bone remodelling studies...|$|E

40|$|An {{approach}} to analysing multisubject {{multivariate time series}} {{is the use of}} a series of P-technique Analyses for each of the subjects. To overcome the problem of assessing the differences between subjects in intraindividual variability, Timmerman and Kiers (in press) proposed the use of Simultaneous Component Analysis (SCA) as an alternative to a series of P-technique analyses. In SCA, the multivariate time series of each subject are decomposed into a <b>common</b> <b>loading</b> matrix, and series of subject specific component scores. Four variants of SCA are distinguished, which differ in their degree of interindividual differences in intraindividual variability. A drawback of SCA is that variability in level between subjects is ignored. Therefore, Multilevel SCA (MSCA) is proposed, of which SCA is a special case. MSCA reveals a model of intraindividual variation, just as SCA, and of interindividual variation in level. Thus, a model of both within and between subjects variation is provided, as will be illustrated by means of an empirical example. Properties and estimation procedures of MSCA will be discussed. Special attention will be devoted to the relationships between MSCA and competitive models, which are mainly found in the context of Structural Equatio...|$|E

Twenty-two such heuristics are tested including the well-known greedy Nearest-Neighbor (NN) heuristic, and the established Savings heuristic of Clarke and Wright. Two SDVRP variations of the NN algorithm are introduced, namely the Nearest-Fill (NF) and Nearest-Fill Farthest-Start (NFFS) heuristics.

Geometric factors involved in the preliminary design are arch radius, pitch, truss depth, and longitudinal length of the barrel including truss panel shape. It {{is not an easy}} matter to formulate a successful model without having to go through a number of trial computer runs which will boost the preliminary design cost.

Approximate formulas for analysis are determined from exact solutions of various models under <b>common</b> <b>loading</b> conditions by using the SAP IV computer program.

To achieve physical cooperation with multiple manipulators working on a common object, interaction forces need to be controlled throughout the motion. The aim of this research is to develop an inverse dynamics model-based cooperative force and position control scheme for multiple robot manipulators. An extended definition of motion is proposed to include force demands based on a constrained Lagrangian dynamics and Lagrangian multipliers formulation. This allows the direct calculation of the inverse dynamics with both motion and force demands.
