5|$|Gasketball is an action, sports {{video game}} for the iPad by Mikengreg, an {{independent}} development team of Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. Players flick basketballs through 2D physics puzzles into the hoop in single-player, local multiplayer, and asynchronous HORSE-style online multiplayer modes. The game is free-to-play with in-app purchases. Development began in mid 2011 following Mikengreg's successful Solipskier. They were able to live from the earnings for Gasketball two year development at their previous salary, which afforded them the stability to try new avenues and reject prototypes, though they worked 100-hour weeks. Towards {{the end of their}} development, they ran out of money and lived on the couches of friends. It was released on August 9, 2012, and the game did not reach their desired <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> at the time of launch.|$|E
5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. The feed <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg of cholesterol. Among the fatty acids, palmitoleic, oleic and linolenic acids {{were found to be}} the most abundant. Varying amounts of potassium, sodium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc were present.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{guidance}} paper of the European Psychiatric Association is to provide evidence-based recommendations on the early detection of a clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis in patients with mental problems. To this aim, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting on <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> to psychosis in non-overlapping samples meeting any at least {{any one of the}} main CHR criteria: ultra-high risk (UHR) and/or basic symptoms criteria. Further, effects of potential moderators (different UHR criteria definitions, single UHR criteria and age) on <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> were examined. <b>Conversion</b> <b>rates</b> in the identified 42 samples with altogether more than 4000 CHR patients who had mainly been identified by UHR criteria and/or the basic symptom criterion ‘cognitive disturbances’ (COGDIS) showed considerable heterogeneity. While UHR criteria and COGDIS were related to similar <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> until 2 -year follow-up, <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> of COGDIS were significantly higher thereafter. Differences in onset and frequency requirements of symptomatic UHR criteria or in their different consideration of functional decline, substance use and co-morbidity did not seem to impact on <b>conversion</b> <b>rates.</b> The ‘genetic risk and functional decline’ UHR criterion was rarely met and only showed an insignificant pooled sample effect. However, age significantly affected UHR <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> with lower rates in children and adolescents. Although more research into potential sources of heterogeneity in <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> is needed to facilitate improvement of CHR criteria, six evidence-based recommendations for an early detection of psychosis were developed as a basis for the EPA guidance on early intervention in CHR states...|$|R
40|$|Improved {{optoelectronic}} patternrecognition encoders {{that measure}} rotary and linear 1 -dimensional positions at <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> (numbers of readings per unit time) exceeding 20 kHz have been invented. Heretofore, optoelectronic pattern-recognition absoluteposition encoders {{have been limited}} to <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> < 15 Hz [...] too low for emerging industrial applications in which <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> ranging from 1 kHz {{to as much as}} 100 kHz are required. The high <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> of the improved encoders are made possible, in part, by use of vertically compressible or binnable (as described below) scale patterns in combination with modified readout sequences of the image sensors [charge-coupled devices (CCDs) ] used to read the scale patterns. The modified readout sequences and the processing of the images thus read out are amenable to implementation by use of modern, high-speed, ultra-compact microprocessors and digital signal processors or field-programmable gate arrays. This combination of improvements makes it possible to greatly increase <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> through substantial reductions in all three components of conversion time: exposure time, image-readout time, and image-processing time...|$|R
5|$|At Denver, Manning again led three scoring {{drives in}} the fourth quarter in a 34–31 shootout win. He {{completed}} 32-of-39 passes for 345 yards and three touchdowns. Following a second straight season with a win at New England, then a home win against Buffalo, the Colts were the NFL's last unbeaten team at 9–0. Their first loss would come in Dallas. Plagued by a run defense that would allow over 100 yards in every game, the Colts were 11–4 heading into their final game. Against Miami, Manning threw for 282 yards, two touchdowns and rushed for another touchdown. The Colts won 27–22, were AFC South division champions, and clinched the third seed in the AFC playoffs. Manning was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week. He ended the regular season with 4,397 passing yards and a league-leading 31 touchdown passes. His passer rating (101.0) was the highest in the league for the third year in a row. Manning helped the offense set an NFL record for third down <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> in a season (56.1%).|$|E
5|$|An early {{algorithmic}} use of pseudoforests {{involves the}} network simplex algorithm and {{its application to}} generalized flow problems modeling the conversion between commodities of different types. In these problems, one is given as input a flow network in which the vertices model each commodity and the edges model allowable conversions between one commodity and another. Each edge is marked with a capacity (how much of a commodity can be converted per unit time), a flow multiplier (the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> between commodities), and a cost (how much loss or, if negative, profit is incurred per unit of conversion). The task is {{to determine how much}} of each commodity to convert via each edge of the flow network, in order to minimize cost or maximize profit, while obeying the capacity constraints and not allowing commodities of any type to accumulate unused. This type of problem can be formulated as a linear program, and solved using the simplex algorithm. The intermediate solutions arising from this algorithm, as well as the eventual optimal solution, have a special structure: each edge in the input network is either unused or used to its full capacity, except for a subset of the edges, forming a spanning pseudoforest of the input network, for which the flow amounts may lie between zero and the full capacity. In this application, unicyclic graphs are also sometimes called augmented trees and maximal pseudoforests are also sometimes called augmented forests.|$|E
5|$|Despite his decisive penalty miss in the 1994 World Cup final shoot-out, Baggio is {{statistically}} {{one of the}} greatest penalty kick specialists in Italian football history. Baggio scored 85% of his career penalties with only 19 misses, scoring 108 out of 127 penalties in official matches, the most in Italian football history. He scored 10 with Vicenza, 25 with Fiorentina, 38 with Juventus, 5 with Milan, 11 with Bologna, 1 with Inter, 11 with Brescia and 7 with Italy (from 7 attempts, the most goals scored from the spot {{by a member of the}} national team.) 68 of his penalties were scored in Serie A, from 83 attempts, with an 82% <b>conversion</b> <b>rate,</b> one of the best records in Serie A history. In Serie A, Baggio scored 17 penalties for Fiorentina (from 19 attempts), 25 for Juventus (from 28 attempts), 3 for Milan (from 5 attempts), 11 for Bologna (from 11 attempts), 1 for Inter (from 2 attempts), and 11 for Brescia (from 18 attempts). Baggio has scored penalties for six different Serie A clubs. Four of his fifteen misses in Serie A were then scored on rebounds. Behind Totti, Baggio has scored the most penalties in Serie A history. Of his other penalties, 8 were scored in Serie C (from 8 attempts), 8 in European competitions (from 9 attempts), and 17 in the Coppa Italia (from 20 attempts). In shootouts, Baggio has converted three of four career penalties; in World Cup shootouts, Baggio scored twice (1990 and 1998), with his only miss in 1994.|$|E

In sum, this evidence shows that, in general, Spanish manufacturing firms have been rather reluctant to offer contract conversions, most plausibly due to the high EPL gap between permanent and temporary workers.|$|R

5|$|The first {{match in}} October {{was on the}} 4th; it was an away match at Parque de Jogos, Moreirense's home ground. Benfica won 4–1, which was their largest win all season. Camacho {{attributed}} the team's success to an improvement in the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> of the attacking line. After a break for international matches, Benfica returned with the second leg of the UEFA Cup on the 15th. They dominated the match, and only a strong performance from Silvio Proto allowed the Belgians to leave with only a goal conceded. Two days later, Benfica announced they were rescheduling the game against Marítimo from 25 October to 12 November, due to the opening game of the new Estádio da Luz on the same day. On 19 October, Benfica ended their six-month spell at Estádio Nacional with a match against Gil Vicente. Benfica scored first but Gil Vicente equalized three minutes later, unsettling the home side. In the second half, Simão scored the winning goal for Benfica. Camacho acknowledged that Benfica struggled after conceding Gil Vicente's goal, adding {{that it was a}} normal behaviour in football. On the 25th, Benfica opened its brand new Estádio da Luz, attracting a sell-out crowd against Nacional Montevideo. Benfica won 2–1, with Nuno Gomes scoring twice. On the following Wednesday, Benfica opened the redeveloped Estádio Cidade de Coimbra, in a game transferred from August. Simão put on a man of the match performance, leading the team to a 3–1 win to Académica.|$|E
