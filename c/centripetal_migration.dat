40|$|AbstractIn the {{follicle}} cell (FC) epithelium {{that surrounds the}} Drosophila egg, {{a complex set of}} cell signals specifies two cell fates that pattern the eggshell: the anterior centripetal FC that produce the operculum and the posterior columnar FC that produce the main body eggshell structure. We have previously shown that the long-range morphogen DPP represses the expression of the bunched (bun) gene in the anterior-most centripetal FC. bun, which encodes a homolog of vertebrate TSC- 22 /GILZ, in turn represses anterior gene expression and antagonizes Notch signaling to restrict centripetal FC fates in posterior cells. From a screen for novel targets of bun repression we have identified the C/EBP homolog slow border cells (slbo). At stage 10 A, slbo expression overlaps bun in anterior FC; by stage 10 B they repress each other's expression to establish a sharp slbo/bun expression boundary. The precise position of the slbo/bun expression boundary is sensitive to Notch signaling, which is required for both slbo activation and bun repression. As <b>centripetal</b> <b>migration</b> proceeds from stages 10 B– 14, slbo represses its own expression and both slbo loss-of-function mutations and overexpression approaches reveal that slbo is required to coordinate <b>centripetal</b> <b>migration</b> with nurse cell dumping. We propose that in anterior FC exposed to a Dpp morphogen gradient, high and low levels of slbo and bun, respectively, are established by modulation of Notch signaling to direct threshold cell fates. Interactions among Notch, slbo and bun resemble a conserved signaling cassette that regulates mammalian adipocyte differentiation...|$|E
40|$|When microtubules in teleost melanophores are {{disrupted}} with antimitotic agents, colchicine, high hydrostatic pressure, low temperature, and vinblastine, {{the alignment}} and {{movement of the}} pigment granules in these cells disappear; during recovery, the return of alignment and movement corresponds in both time and space with the repolymerization of microtubules. Furthermore, analysis of nearest neighbor distances in untreated melanophores reveals that pigment granules are closely associated with microtubules. Other structures such as microfilaments, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the cytoplasmic matrix {{do not appear to}} be involved. Thus we conclude that microtubules determine the alignment and are essential for the selective movements of the pigment granules in these cells. Investigations of the mechanism of movement show that microtubules are required for both centrifugal and <b>centripetal</b> <b>migrations</b> and that they do not change in number or location during redistribution of pigment. Our results further indicate that microtubules in melanophores behave as semistable organelles as determined by investigation with colchicine and hydrostatic pressure. These observations and others rule out a push-pull mechanism based on the polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules or one which distinguishes two operationally different sets of microtubules. We propose instead that particles move by sliding along a fixed array of microtubules...|$|R
40|$|Skip to Next Section The Bicaudal-D (Bic-D) gene is {{required}} early in Drosophila oogenesis for the differentiation of an oocyte {{from one of}} a cluster of 16 interconnected germarial cells. To analyze the role of Bic-D later in oogenesis, we have constructed Drosophila lines in which Bic-D expression is {{under the control of}} the hsp 70 promoter. In these flies, Bic-D activity can be induced early in oogenesis, allowing an oocyte to be made. Then, by shifting females to non-inducing conditions, Bic-D levels are depleted for the remainder of oogenesis. Using this system, we find that Bic-D is indeed required in the later stages of oogenesis. In ovaries from mutant females, oocyte growth is reduced, apparently due to defects in nurse-cell-to-oocyte transport. Smaller oocyte size results in the misalignment of follicle cells and the underlying germ line, leading to ventralization of dorsal follicle cells and to defects in <b>centripetal</b> cell <b>migration.</b> In addition, we show that Bic-D {{is required}} for the localization of specific mRNAs at both the anterior and posterior of the oocyte...|$|R

Within each egg chamber, there are 16 large germ line cells encompassed by about 650 somatic epithelial follicle cells. Of this set of epithelial cells, some cells will take on specialized fates, such as the border cells.

40|$|SummaryEpithelial {{reorganization}} involves coordinated {{changes in}} cell shapes and movements. This restructuring occurs during formation of placodes, ectodermal thickenings that initiate the morphogenesis of epithelial organs including hair, mammary gland, and tooth. Signaling pathways in ectodermal placode formation are well known, but the cellular mechanisms have remained ill defined. We established imaging methodology for live visualization of embryonic skin explants {{during the first}} wave of hair placode formation. We found {{that the vast majority of}} placodal cells were nonproliferative throughout morphogenesis. We show that cell compaction and <b>centripetal</b> <b>migration</b> are the main cellular mechanisms associated with hair placode morphogenesis and that inhibition of actin remodeling suppresses placode formation. Stimulation of both ectodysplasin/NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin signaling increased cell motility and the number of cells committed to placodal fate. Thus, cell fate choices and morphogenetic events are controlled by the same molecular pathways, providing the framework for coordination of these two processes...|$|E

Here, we show that endogenous PACAP is responsible for the transient arrest phase of GN {{at the level of the}} Purkinje cell layer (PCL) but has no effect on B/SC. tPA is devoid of direct effect on GN motility in vitro, although it is widely distributed along interneuron migratory routes in the ML, PCL, and internal granular layer.

BICAUDAL-C carries five KH domains required for in vitroRNA-binding and for in vivo activity. Here, I show that Bicaudal-C functions, through RNA-binding, to regulate oskar expression during mid-oogenesis. Females carrying mutations in Bicaudal-C in the regions encoding its KH domains display premature, ectopic translation of OSKAR at the anterior of their stages 8 [...] 10 oocytes; this likely accounts for the disruption of anterior patterning in embryos of Bicaudal-C/+ females.

40|$|AbstractStage 10 of Drosophila {{oogenesis}} can be {{subdivided into}} stages 10 A and 10 B {{based on a}} change in the morphology of the centripetal follicle cells (FC) from a columnar to an apically constricted shape. This coordinated cell shape change drives epithelial cell sheet involution between the oocyte and nurse cell complex which patterns the operculum structure of the mature eggshell. We have shown previously that proper <b>centripetal</b> FC <b>migration</b> requires transient expression of the C/EBP encoded by slow border cells (slbo) at 10 A, due in part to Notch activation followed by slbo autorepression (Levine et al., 2007). Here we show that decreased slbo expression in the centripetal FC coincides with increased expression of the transcription factor Cut, a Cut/Cux/CDP family member, at 10 B. The 10 A/ 10 B temporal switch from Slbo to Cut expression is refined by both cross repression between Slbo and Cut, Slbo auto repression and Cut auto activation. High Cut levels are necessary and sufficient to direct polarized, supracellular accumulation of Actin, DE-cadherin and Armadillo associated with apical constriction of the centripetal FC. Separately, Slbo in the border cell rosette and Cut in the pole cells have antagonistic interactions to restrict Fas 2 accumulation to the pole cells, which is important for proper border cell migration. The opposing effects of Cut and Slbo in these two tissues reflect the opposing interactions between their respective mammalian homologs CAAT Displacement Protein (CDP; now CUX 1) and CAAT Enhancer Binding Protein (C/EBP) in tissue culture...|$|R

TO {{determine}} whether the capacity of Langerhans cells (LCs) to abrogate ocular immune privilege can be suppressed by the topical application of interleukin- 1 receptor antagonist (IL-lra). METHODS. Cautery was applied to corneas of BALB/c mice on day 0 to induce <b>centripetal</b> <b>migration</b> of LCs. Immune privilege was tested by the ability to induce anterior chamber-associated immune deviation (ACAID) to intracamerally injected soluble antigen 1 to 2 weeks after cautery application. The number of LCs was enumerated by inimunofluorescent staining. In other experiments, freshly procured Thy- 1 -depleted epidermal cells, with or without LC depletion, were injected directly into virgin murine corneas before testing for ACAID. All test animals were randomized for treatment with either topical IL-lra or placebo in a masked fashion for 1 to 2 weeks after induction of LC migration and before intracameral injection of antigen. RESULTS. Intracorneal injection of freshly procured LC-depleted epidermal cells into normal eyes failed to abrogate ACAID, whereas LC-containing cell populations uniformly led to loss of immune privilege (P 80 %) suppression of LC migration compared with untreated controls (P < 0. 01).

40|$|Renewal of {{stratified}} squamous epithelia, eg, the epidermis, the esophagus, or the epithelia {{lining the}} oral cavity, normally {{depends on the}} presence of keratinocyte stem cells that are thoroughly distributed in the epithelial basal layer. It is commonly thought that stem cells divide asymmetrically and generate transient amplifying cells. In turn, the latter generate postmitotic cells, which will replace the terminally differentiated cells that constantly slough off the epithelial surface. In this model, each stem cell only renews a tiny epithelial column, even if it has the capacity to generate a large amount of epithelium, a property important during wound healing. Interestingly, the cornea is an exception among stratified epithelia, because it does not contain stem cells but rather relies on the <b>centripetal</b> <b>migration</b> of transient amplifying cells generated by stem cells dividing occasionally and located at the limbus, the transition zone of the cornea with the conjunctiva.

30|$|During {{cerebellar}} development, {{granule cell}} precursors are produced from a secondary germinative zone forming the external granule cell layer (EGL). Immature granule neurons {{from the inner}} part of the EGL then start a tangential migration followed by a <b>centripetal</b> inward radial <b>migration</b> across the molecular and Purkinje cell layers to reach their final destination {{at the bottom of}} the forming internal granule cell layer (IGL). This complex migratory process is highly regulated and takes about 2 days in rodents and it is essential for the proper formation of the cortical layers forming the mature cerebellum. In the IGL, granule cells differentiate to establish functional excitatory synapses with GABAergic neurons including Purkinje, basket, stellate and Golgi cells, or die. Some neurotrophins and neurotransmitters have been shown to be involved in the control of cerebellar granule cell survival, migration and differentiation. Initially, when I started my carrier as a researcher, we used to claim that very few neuropeptides were produced in the cerebellum. Nevertheless, we now know that this was wrong as we have recently identified by mass spectrometry over 70 peptides expressed in the cerebellum during development. Over the years, the involvement of some of these peptides such as somatostatin, PACAP or ODN, has been established in the control of cerebellar granule cell survival, migration and differentiation as will illustrate my presentation.|$|R

The lesion healed in 15 days by <b>centripetal</b> proliferation and <b>migration</b> of endothelial cells from adjacent uninjured areas. As controls, we used the uninjured contralateral artery. In parallel experiments, the vascular endothelium was sampled either for autoradiography after administration of 3 H-thymidine or for freeze fracturing. Proliferative activity was measured by calculating the labeling index in autoradiographs of endothelium. The surface areas of gap junctions {{and that of the}} lateral endothelial membranes was measured by planimetry in electron micrographs of freeze fracture replicas. Two days after injury, cells at the growing edge of the endothelium revealed a marked decrease in the density and surface area of gap junctions, loss of tight junctions, and high labeling index (232 +/- 55 S. E. M.). At seven days, the labeling index was lower (61 +/- 31 S. E. M.), gap junctions were small but numerous, and short segments of tight junctions were present. At fifteen days, the endothelial integrity was restored, the labeling index was at control levels (3. 32 +/- 3 S. E. M.), and both gap and tight junctions were well developed and indistinguishable from controls. The study shows that loss of junctions between endothelial cells is associated with high proliferative activity. As a corollary, well-developed gap junctions may prevent the response of the uninjured endothelium to circulating mitogens...|$|R
40|$|Post-operative {{adhesion}} is {{a common}} complication after abdominal surgery, with high impact on patient wellbeing and healthcare costs. The repair of peritoneum is a complex process involving orderly phases which share some common features to normal wound healing. These include coagulation, infiltration of inflammatory cells, cell proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and remodelling, often with overlap between phases. The unique feature of peritoneal repair is that both small and large peritoneal wounds heal in a similar time. The peritoneum is a monolayer of elongated, flattened, squamous-like peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMC). Local mesothelial cell proliferation, <b>centripetal</b> cell <b>migration</b> from the wound edge, as well as incorporation of free-floating mesothelial cells may all contribute to repair of injured peritoneum. To date, the only well-characterised pathologic mechanism underlying post-operative adhesion formation {{at the molecular level}} is the formation of the fibrin layer and regulation of peritoneal fibrinolytic capacity. However, the contributions of collagen deposition and ECM remodelling to the peritoneal repair mechanism are not well understood. This thesis focuses on the role of PMC in the regulation of ECM deposition and remodelling in response to inflammatory stimuli in both in vivo and in vitro models, aiming to identify other key pro-fibrotic factors involved in the development of post-operative adhesion. We first identified that lysyl oxidase (LOX) {{played a key role in}} the progression of peritoneal fibrosis by regulating collagen cross-linking and deposition in vivo. The inhibition of LOX enzyme activity prevented the formation of fibrotic tissue by reducing collagen deposition. Meanwhile, dexamethasone (DEX) treatment also minimized the fibrotic response. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that the induction of collagen deposition factors in PMC, including LOX and pro-collagen I, required both IL- 1 and TGF-β signalling pathways. Thus, the combination of IL- 1 + TGF-β was adopted in an in vitro model to mimic the inflammatory environment during peritoneal repair. Treatment of PMC with IL- 1 +TGF-β caused an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These transformed PMC had enhanced cell motility and were more adherent to fibronectin. Finally, a real-time quantitative PCR-based microarray was used for genomic analysis of ECM-adhesion-related PMC genes in response to IL- 1 and TGF-β treatment. The results showed that IL- 1 was more involved in regulating ECM degradation by inducing expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes, whereas TGF-β mainly affected genes involved in ECM deposition, including collagens and other ECM components. However, both cytokines were shown to regulate some key genes involved in the development of adhesion, including COL 16 A 1, COL 7 A 1, FN 1, ITGA 5, and TGFB 1. Moreover, IL- 1 was shown to reduce ITGA 4 and ITGB 6 expression affecting adherence of PMC to basement membrane, while TGF-β increased MMP 14 and MMP 16 expression, which could facilitate invasion of EMT-transformed PMC to the site of tissue repair. In summary, this thesis indicates that LOX plays an important role in peritoneal fibrosis. Secondly, a combination of IL- 1 and TGF-β 1 treatment demonstrates how these factors can act in concert to orchestrate tissue remodelling during peritoneal repair. Finally, genomic analysis of ECM-adhesion genes increases our understanding of aspects of the pathology of post-operative adhesion and identifies novel potential therapeutic targets to prevent adhesion formation.

Exposure of 5 -d granulosa cell cultures to pyrene-concanavalin A (P-Con A) or 3, 3 '-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine-labeled low-density lipoprotein (dil-LDL) at 4 °C results in the formation of randomly distributed endosomes 10 min after warming to 37 °C that exhibit saltatory motion for 20 min. If granulosa cells are labeled at 4 °C with both P-Con A and dil-LDL and warmed to 37 °C, both ligands are found within the same endosomes which migrate centripetally to the cell center where label accumulates within phase-dense structures by 60 min.

These mice do not exhibit an overt skin phenotype but show protracted skin wound re-epithelialization. Investigation into the underlying mechanisms revealed that in vivo both proliferation of wound-edge keratinocytes and <b>centripetal</b> <b>migration</b> of the neo-epidermis were impaired.

Adhesion, spreading, random migration and closure of scratch wounds in vitro were significantly inhibited on collagen I and, to a lesser extent, on fibronectin. Stroboscopic analysis of cell dynamics (SACED) of N 17 Rac 1 transgenic and control keratinocytes identified decreased lamella-protrusion persistence in connection with increased ruffle frequency as a probable mechanism for the observed impairment of keratinocyte adhesion and migration.

Nonstimulated (resting) platelets from leukemic patients varied greatly in size; exhibited marked {{variation in the}} number of alpha granules present per cell; had poorly delineated circumferential bands of microtubules; and often grossly dilated open channel systems or cytoplasmic vacuolization. The intracellular concentrations of ATP and ADP were significantly below normal, and the specific radioactivity of ATP and ADP of nonstimulated platelets in leukemia was equivalent to or exceeded that seen in stimulated normal platelets. Addition of ADP or collagen to platelets from leukemic patients was followed by retarded and incomplete shape change, delayed and incomplete <b>centripetal</b> <b>migration</b> of subcellular organelles, impaired degranulation, and the formation of loose aggregates composed of relatively few platelets. Stimulation of "leukemic" platelets with collagen led to the release of significantly subnormal amounts of ATP and ADP and no significant change in the specific radioactivity of the intracellular nucleotides. In contrast to the results in normal platelets, the conversion of ATP to inosine monophosphate and hypoxanthine in platelets in leukemia failed to increase significantly with collagen stimulation. The results indicate that abnormalities exist in the storage pool of adenine nucleotides and the release mechanism of platelets in acute leukemia. These defects appear to contribute to an impairment in the release reaction in these platelets.

40|$|This {{study was}} funded {{in part by}} grants from Alcon, Retina France and the Institut Carnot. M. P. is the {{recipient}} of a contract “Interface” from INSERM. International audienceMicroglial cells (MCs) are active sensors and reactive phagocytes of neural tissues. They are known to migrate and accumulate in areas of neuronal damage. Thus, microglial locomotion is an essential feature of the inflammatory reaction in neural tissue. Yet, to our knowledge there has been no report of direct in vivo observation of the migration of MCs. Here, we show that intravitreally injected cyanine dyes (DiO, DiI, and indocyanine green) are sequestrated in MCs during several months, and subsequently in vivo images of these fluorescent MCs can be obtained by confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. This enabled noninvasive, time-lapse observation of the migrating behavior of MCs, both in the basal state and following laser damage. In the basal state, a slow, intermittent, random-like locomotion was observed. Following focal laser damage, MCs promptly (i. e., within 1 h) initiated centripetal, convergent migration. MCs up to 400 μm away migrated into the scar at velocities up to 7 μm/min. This early phase of <b>centripetal</b> <b>migration</b> was followed by a more prolonged phase of nontargeted locomotion around and within injured sites during at least 24 h. Cyanine-positive cells persisted within the scar during several weeks. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo observation of the locomotion of individual MCs. Our results show that the locomotion of MCs is not limited to translocation to acutely damaged area, but may also be observed in the basal state and after completion of the recruitment of MCs into scars...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{compare the}} {{different}} schemes {{that have been}} proposed during the last thirteen years to explain the renewal of the corneal epithelium. Material and Methods:We analyzed all the data present in the literature to explain the renewal of the corneal epithelium in mammals. According to the schemes proposed in the literature we developed a 3 D animation to facilitate {{the understanding of the}} different concepts. Results:Three different schemes have been proposed to explain the renewal of the corneal epithelium in mammals during the last thirteen years. 1950 - 1981 : the corneal epithelium was thought being renewed by mitosis of cells located in the basal layer. At this time scientist were not talking about stem cells. 1981 - 1986 was the period of the "XYZ hypothesis" or the transdifferentiation paradigm. At this time the conjunctival epithelium renewed the corneal epithelium in a <b>centripetal</b> <b>migration.</b> 1986 - 2008 : the limbal stem cell paradigm, there were no stem cells in the corneal epithelium, all the corneal stem cells were located in the limbus and renewed the central cornea after a migration of 6 to 7 mm of transient amplifying cells toward the centre of the cornea. 2008, epithelial stem cells were found in the central cornea in mammals (Nature, Majo et al. November 2008). Discussion:We thought that the renewal of the corneal epithelium was completely defined. According to the last results we published in Nature, the current paradigm will be revisited. The experiments we made were on animals and the final demonstration on human has still to be done. If we find the same results in human, a new paradigm will be define and will change the way we consider ocular surface therapy and reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present keratin {{expression}} data that lend strong support to {{a model of}} corneal epithelial maturation in which the stem cells {{are located in the}} limbus, the transitional zone between cornea and conjunctiva. Using a new monoclonal antibody, AE 5, which is highly specific for a 64, 000 -mol-wt corneal keratin, designated RK 3, we demonstrate that this keratin is localized in all cell layers of rabbit corneal epithelium, but only in the suprabasal layers of the limbal epithelium. Analysis of cultured corneal keratinocytes showed that they express sequentially three major keratin pairs. Early cultures consisting of a monolayer of "basal" cells express mainly the 50 / 58 K keratins, exponentially growing cells synthesize additional 48 / 56 K keratins, and postconfluent, heavily stratified cultures begin to express the 55 / 64 K corneal keratins. Cell separation experiments showed that basal cells isolated from postconfluent cultures contain predominantly the 50 / 58 K pair, whereas suprabasal cells contain additional 55 / 64 K and 48 / 56 K pairs. Basal cells of the older, postconfluent cultures, however, can become AE 5 positive, indicating that suprabasal location is not a prerequisite for the expression of the 64 K keratin. Taken together, these results suggest that the acidic 55 K and basic 64 K keratins represent markers for an advanced stage of corneal epithelial differentiation. The fact that epithelial basal cells of central cornea but not those of the limbus possess the 64 K keratin therefore indicates that corneal basal cells are in a more differentiated state than limbal basal cells. These findings, coupled with the known <b>centripetal</b> <b>migration</b> of corneal epithelial cells, strongly suggest that corneal epithelial stem cells are located in the limbus, and that corneal basal cells correspond to "transient amplifying cells" in the scheme of "stem cells [...] transient amplifying cells [...] terminally differentiated cells. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE:Skeletal muscle may be {{the site}} of a variety of poorly {{understood}} immune reactions, particularly after myofiber injury, which is typically observed in inflammatory myopathies. This study was undertaken to explore both the cell dynamics and functions of resident macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) in damaged muscle, using a mouse model of notexin-induced myoinjury to study innate immune cell reactions. METHODS:The myeloid cell reaction to notexin-induced myoinjury was analyzed by microscopy and flow cytometry. Bone marrow (BM) transplantation studies were used to discriminate resident from exudate monocyte/macrophages. Functional tests included cytokine screening and an alloantigenic mixed leukocyte reaction to assess the antigen-presenting cell (APC) function. Selective resident macrophage depletion was obtained by injection of diphtheria toxin (DT) into CD 11 b-DT receptor-transgenic mice transplanted with DT-insensitive BM. RESULTS:The connective tissue surrounding mouse muscle/fascicle tissue (the epimysium/perimysium) after deep muscle injury displayed a resident macrophage population of CD 11 b+F 4 / 80 +CD 11 c-Ly- 6 C-CX 3 CR 1 - cells, which concentrated first in the epimysium. These resident macrophages were being used by leukocytes as a <b>centripetal</b> <b>migration</b> pathway, and were found to selectively release 2 chemokines, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and to crucially contribute to massive recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes from the blood. Early epimysial inflammation consisted of a predominance of Ly- 6 C(high) CX 3 CR 1 (low) CD 11 c- cells that were progressively substituted by Ly- 6 C(low) CX 3 CR 1 (high) cells displaying an intermediate, rather than high, level of CD 11 c expression. These CD 11 c(intermediate) cells were derived from circulating CCR 2 + monocytes, functionally behaved as immature APCs in the absence of alloantigenic challenge, and migrated to draining lymph nodes while acquiring the phenotype of mature DCs (CD 11 c+Ia+CD 80 + cells, corresponding to an inflammatory DC phenotype). CONCLUSION:The results in this mouse model show that resident macrophages in the muscle epimysium/perimysium orchestrate the innate immune response to myoinjury, which is linked to adaptive immunity through the formation of inflammatory DCs...|$|E
40|$|Vital {{fluorescence}} staining {{has been}} used in conjunction with time- lapse video image intensification microscopy to analyze the distribution and movement of endosomes, lysosomes, and mitochondria in cultured rat ovarian granulosa cells. Exposure of 5 -d granulosa cell cultures to pyrene-concanavalin A (P-Con A) or 3, 3 '- dioctadecylindocarbocyanine-labeled low-density lipoprotein (dil-LDL) at 4 degrees C results in the formation of randomly distributed endosomes 10 min after warming to 37 degrees C that exhibit saltatory motion for 20 min. If granulosa cells are labeled at 4 degrees C with both P-Con A and dil-LDL and warmed to 37 degrees C, both ligands are found within the same endosomes which migrate centripetally to the cell center where label accumulates within phase-dense structures by 60 min. The initial endosome saltations occur over short distances (mean distance = 4. 6 micron) with a mean velocity of 0. 03 micron/s. Endosome saltations then cease and are followed by a gradual centriptal migration of endosomes to the cell center where they accumulate and fuse with phase-dense structures. The second phase of movement involves a continuous, unidirectional migration of endosomes over distances ranging from 5 to 40 micron at a mean velocity of 0. 05 micron/s. Lysosomes were simultaneously visualized as acridine orange-staining, phase-dense structures in control cells and cells exposed to fluorescent ligands. In untreated cells, lysosomes are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and undergo bidirectional saltations covering a mean distance of 8. 7 micron with a mean velocity of 0. 3 micron/s. Lysosomes redistribute centripetally to the perinuclear region of the cell by saltatory movement within 20 min of exposure to ligand. Mitochondria were visualized with the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 in granulosa cells labeled with P-Con A and were found to redistribute to the cell center coincident with endosomes. The microtubule-disrupting agent nocodazole was found to inhibit lysosome saltations and all phases of endosome movement. Taxol, a microtubule-stabilizing agent, partially impaired lysosome movement and led to a redistribution of lysosomes into linear aggregates surrounding the nucleus. Taxol was also found to inhibit endosome movement. The data indicate that (a) endosome movement proceeds initially by saltation and later by a nonsaltatory <b>centripetal</b> <b>migration</b> in association with mitochondria, that (b) lysosomes and endosomes undergo a temporally distinct but spatially similar change in cytoplasmic distribution, and that (c) microtubules are required for the directed translocation of endosomes and lysosomes towards the cell center...|$|E
40|$|Coordinated cell {{migration}} {{is essential for}} tissue regeneration andÃ‚Â· development. During migration cells sense various directional cues from the surrounding environment, and intracellular mechanisms process this extracellular information resulting in appropriate vectorial cell movement. During corneal epithelial maintenance, cells migrate centripetally from the limbal region towards {{the centre of the}} cornea. This centripetal movement is genetically controlled by Pax 6 (Collinson et aI., 2004), one of the master genes in eye development (Kozmik, 2005). The guidance cues and cellular mechanisms controlling <b>centripetal</b> <b>migration</b> of corneal epithelial cells remain to be elucidated. Clarifying the mechanisms guiding {{cell migration}} in an experimentally accessible model of corneal epithelial cells would be relevant to mechanisms controlling vectorial cell migration in other cell types. In this project the roles of endogenous electrical and chemical cues in directing corneal epithelial cell migration were tested using in-vitro and ex-vivo culture systems in which migration was induce by wounding. It was ~hown that Pax 6 + 1 - cells suffer from a 2 h wound healing delay, but at later time points, the migration is not significantly different from pax~/+ cells (Leiper et aI., 2006). Additionally Pax 6 + 1 - cells showed defective glycoprotein trafficking which is als~ affecting tJ-le molecules not directly controlled by Pax 6 at the transcriptional level and potentially increasing the number of molecular defects contributing to the Pax 6 + 1 - phenotype [...] An ex-vivo whole eye system was developed which subsequently demonstrated growth factor dependent woiInd healing defect of pax~/- cells, in contrast to Pax 6 + 1 + epithelia which healed and migrated normally regardless externally supplied growth factors. Exogenous application ofEGF was found to restore wound healing in pax~/cells to wild-type levels. The extensive part of the work was focused on elucidating the role of electrical guidance in wound healing and migration. Recent publications have established roles for endogenous electric current in guiding epithelial ceIl migration (Zhao et aI., 2006) but until this project, there was no genetic model 'of defective 'wound-induced currents. paxrt'l- eyes were found to have compromised or reversed wound mediated currents and were therefore used as model to investigate the importance of electrical cues for normal wound healing. The study represented the most rigorous challenge yet to the hypothesised roles of endogenous electric fields, and surprisingly the analysis showed no significant correlation between electrical cues and directional migration, based on the observation that Pax 6 + 1 - with defective signals healed at rates not significantly different from control wild type epithelia. Further investigation showed no significant correlation ofelectric current and wound healing even in Pax 6 + 1 +eyes. In searching for molecular mechanis 1 J 1 s controlling directional migration in applied EFs, Pax 6 + 1 - cells were used as model because the cells previously showed compromised or reverse response to in-vitro applied EFs. Src was identified as a candidate signalling molecule playing an important role in mediating directional migration and additionally failure of pSrc to polarise in paxrt'l- cells in applied electric fields correlated with their impaired migration response. Finally wound healing acceleration by addition of Shh peptide was shown to be Pax 6 dosage dependent. Investigation of Hh pathway components in Pax 6 + 1 + and paxrt'l- corneal epithelial cells suggested important differences at the level of Gli transcription factors which may underlie the failure of paxrt'l- cell~ to show a migratory respOIise to exogenous Shh.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe results {{presented}} in this dissertation were obtained from three related studies of adrenocortical regeneration which may be characterized as follows: the cytology of (a) adrenocortical regeneration after immediate autotransplantation, (b) adrenocortical regeneration after in vitro x-irradiation of the adrenal gland and (c) the response of young autotransplants to a lethal dose of whole body x-irradiation. Experimental procedures a. Immediate autotransplantation. Sixty-four male albino rats of the Wistar strain weighing between ninety and one hundred grams were bilaterally adrenalectomized by the dorsal route under ether anesthesia. Both adrenals were bisected and immediately autotransplanted to pockets in the dorsal musculature. All animals were given one per cent saline drinking water for the entire experimental period and Purina Laboratory Chow was fed ad libitum. These animals were sacrificed and their transplants removed for study over a twenty-one day period as follows: three rats on each of days one, two, four, five, seven, eight, ten and eleven after operation; and five rats on each of days three, six, nine, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen and twenty-one. In addition, transplants were removed from two animals killed at six hours and two at twelve hours after operation. Ten normal animals in the same weight range were killed and their adrenal glands removed for comparison with regenerating transplants. All tissues were fixed in ten per cent neutral formalin {{for a minimum of}} two weeks. After fixation the tissues were embedded in gelatin, sectioned five microns in thickness by the freezing method, mounted on albuminized slides and stained first for three minutes in Mayer's hemalum and then for four minutes in a filtered, saturated solution of Sudan Black B in seventy per cent alcohol. The tissues were analyzed for cell depth, cell type and per cent take (Wyman et al, 1954). b. X-irradiation of the adrenal gland in vitro. One hundred and ten animals were adrenalectomized and the left adrenal gland of each was placed in mammalian Ringer's and either held there for sixteen minutes at room temperature or irradiated with two thousand roentgens given at a dose rate of one hundred and twenty-five roentgens per minute (the x-ray source was run at one hundred and forty-five kilovolts and six and four tenths milliamperes with a target distance of nine inches). After the irradiation period or the control period the adrenal gland was bisected and autotransplanted to the dorsal musculature. Forty-five animals bearing in vitro control transplants and sixty-five animals bearing in vitro irradiated transplants were sacrificed according to the following schedule: five control and five experimental animals on each of days two, three, four, seven, eight, nine, fourteen, twenty-one and thirty. Ten additional animals with irradiated transplants were killed on each of days two and three after transplantation. The transplants were removed, processed and stained as described (v. s.) and analyzed for cell depth, cell type and per cent take. c. Whole body x-irradiation. Thirty-four rats with two day old transplants and the same number of rats with four day old transplants were placed in small confining boxes and either held there for sixteen minutes as controls or given a total body x-ray dose of two thousand roentgens. All animals were sacrificed twenty-four hours after the control or experimental period and their transplants removed for study. Tissues were processed and analyzed as described above. Observations a. Regeneration after immediate transplantation. The cells of the zona glomerulosa survived after implantation and underwent a series of transformations which resulted in the production of a fully differentiated cortex by the twenty-first day. The transformations involved characteristic changes in the nuclei and the distribution of lipid so that a sequence of five cell types could be recognized, including, in order, "static" glomerulosa cells (one to two days after implantation), "transitional" glomerulosa cells (three to six days), "empty" cortical cells (seven to ten days), "granular" cortical cells (eleven to fourteen days) and mature cortical cells (sixteen to twenty-one days). Immediately after implantation the lipid droplets of glomerulosa cells enlarged and crowded together {{to such an extent that}} nuclei were partially obscured. The hemalum staining of those nuclei which were visible was characteristic of cells that are viable. These cells were generally arranged in small patches around blood vessels in the subcapsular area. They were termed static glomerulosa cells because they appeared to be in a resting or static state prior to growth and differentiation. Three days after implantation, coincident with increased blood vessel growth in the capsular area, the amount of lipid in groups of static cells nearest the capsule decreased. Their nuclei were no longer obscured by a mass of lipid but a few large intensely stained droplets were seen against a gray-green background of cytoplasm. The nuclei were spherical and each contained a single, enlarged nucleolus. These cells were termed transitional glomerulosa cells since they represent a stage through which static cells pass preparatory to mitosis and <b>centripetal</b> <b>migration.</b> At seven days, groups of transitional cells directly beneath the capsule lost all their cytoplasmic lipid and became empty cortical cells. The nuclei remained large and spherical with a single large nucleolus. These cells had the highest rate of mitosis and the total depth of regenerated cortex increased rapidly after empty cortical cells appeared. Lipid droplets and spheroid complexes reappeared in the regenerating tissue between the eleventh and the fourteenth day, but since these lipid forms were finer and more sparsely distributed than those of adult glands, the cells in which they appeared were termed granular cortical cells. Granular cells were found in a spatial arrangement similar to that of adult glomerulosa and fasciculata. Increasing numbers of cortical cells became mature between sixteen and twenty-one days. Mature glomerulosa cells had lipid droplets grouped in clusters, mature fasciculata cells had spheroid complexes of adult size and distribution, and mature reticularis cells contained very large spheroid complexes. Empty cortical cells were assumed to be secreting adrenal hormones at a maximal rate and the appearance of lipid in granular cells was considered an indication of decrease in the secretory rate. Mature cortical cells were assumed to be secreting at normal rates. b. The effect of in vitro x-irradiation. The total depth of cortical tissue regenerated by adrenal glands which had been x-irradiated in vitro was significantly reduced as compared with the in vitro controls from the ninth through the thirtieth day after implantation. Accompanying this reduction in growth rate was a retardation in the development of the sequence of cell types. Transitional and empty cells remained in the slowly growing parenchyma of irradiated glands until the fourteenth day, whereas in the in vitro controls these cells had all been transformed into granular cortical cells in the same time. Granular cells became predominant in the regenerated parenchyma of irradiated glands by the twenty-first day but attained a smaller depth than those of in vitro controls. They remained predonunant through the thirtieth day. A few mature cortical cells were present at that time but they represented only a small fraction of the total mass and had attained far less depth than those of the in vitro controls. This presumably indicates that the secretory rates of granular cells in transplants of irradiated glands are higher than those of in vitro controls on the thirtieth day. Comparison of the sequence of cell types of in vitro controls with that of the immediate transplants revealed that the in vitro control procedure itself caused a delay in the maturation of granular cells. In immediate transplants the depth of granular cortical cells attained a maximum on the fourteenth day and then diminished. Mature cortical cells were the predominant type on the twenty-first day. In the in vitro controls, however, granular cells persisted as the predominant type through the thirtieth day and far fewer mature cells were present at that time than in immediate transplants at twenty-one days. This delay was not accompanied by a retardation in grovJth rate of in vitro controls and was therefore considered a direct effect of the control procedure. c. The effect of whole body x-irradiation on immature transplants. Seventy per cent of the animals subjected to total body x-irradiation on the fourth day after implantation had empty cells in their transplants twenty-four hours after the time of x-irradiation, but these cells were present in only thirty per cent of the controls at that time. Also, the depth of empty cells was approximately doubled while the depth of transitional cells was diminished in the transplants of the animals irradiated on the fourth day. These changes did not occur in the transplants of the animals irradiated on the second day. This seemed to indicate that either the two day old transitional cells were not sufficiently differentiated to respond to ACTH or, that the areas where two day old transitional cells occur were less effectively vascularized than at four days. Static cells in animals irradiated on the second or the fourth day after implantation were not affected by the stress of x-irradiation. This seemed to indicate that static cells were not responsive to ACTH at any time...|$|E
