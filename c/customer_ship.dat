5000|$|Once completed, {{the vessel}} is {{delivered}} to the <b>customer.</b> <b>Ship</b> launching is often a ceremony of some significance, and is usually when the vessel is formally named. A typical small rowboat can cost under US$100, $1,000 for a small speedboat, {{tens of thousands of}} dollars for a cruising sailboat, and about $2,000,000 for a Vendée Globe class sailboat. A 25 m trawler may cost $2.5 million, and a 1,000-person-capacity high-speed passenger ferry can cost in the neighborhood of $50 million. A ship's cost partly depends on its complexity: a small, general cargo ship will cost $20 million, a Panamax-sized bulk carrier around $35 million, a supertanker around $105 million and a large LNG carrier nearly $200 million. The most expensive ships generally are so because of the cost of embedded electronics: a [...] costs around $2 billion, and an aircraft carrier goes for about $3.5 billion.|$|E

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with solving a combined fuel supply vessel scheduling and fuel type allocation problem. The problem is provided by a Hellenic oil company. The company has a small, fixed fleet of fuel supply vessels, which it uses to supply customer ships anchored in the broader area of Piraeus Port outside Athens. The supply vessels are loading multiple types of fuels at refineries before carrying the fuel out to the customer ships. The customers are either mandatory contract ships which must be served, or optional spot ships which may be served if the company has available capacity. The company must decide whether to accept a spot ship or not within only minutes after the inquiry. Based on the contract customers and the accepted spot customers, the company must generate schedules which specify which customers each supply vessel should supply, when this should be done and in what sequence. The planning horizon is three days. The customers specify a time for {{when they want to}} be served, something which must be accounted for in the generated schedules. A given <b>customer</b> <b>ship</b> can place orders of various fuel types to be delivered within the same time interval. All orders placed by a <b>customer</b> <b>ship</b> {{do not have to be}} operated by the same vessel, meaning customer splitting is possible. The fuels demanded must be allocated to compartments within the supply vessels, and fuels of different types cannot be loaded to the same compartment. Conversely, different orders of the same fuel type may be blended within a compartment, and large orders may be split between several compartments. The main objective of this thesis is to develop a detailed optimization model for the problem in order to really getting to know the problem and to study its complexity. This model is intended to serve as a starting point for additional research. Further, we want to utilize the model or variants of this to support the company in its decision making. The model is developed as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem and implemented by use of commercial optimization software. The test cases are generated based on real life information from the company. Due to the complexity of the problem, there is made considerable effort in reducing the numbers of variables and constraints in the implementation of the mathematical model. Valid inequalities and model simplifications are added to the basic model with the intention of further improving the model?s performance. The best solutions were obtained by a model which included both tested model simplifications; stowage elimination and no customer splitting. To get feasible solutions with respect to the real allocation problem, the vessels? total capacities had to be set as low as 50 % of the actual vessel capacities. The model with this capacity fraction performed well on test cases of smaller sizes, but in larger test cases this low capacity limits the possibility of obtaining solutions where all demand is met. The problem is very complex and consequently not easy to solve, but we have seen that simplifying complicating model aspects reduces the model?s complexity and makes the model better able to support the company in its decision making. Still, with regards to support the decision making, there is a need for further research. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Swedish company Kockums AB, at the {{forefront}} within maritime and naval technology, {{is in need of}} a tool, document, and/or method to include environmental aspects in their product development process. This is mainly because of additional requirements put on Kockums AB from their main <b>customer.</b> <b>Ship</b> recycling is the major issue that has to be addressed and included in Kockums AB’sworking procedures. Moreover, ship recycling is a pressing issue to handle due to horrible conditions in South Asian countries, where most ship dismantling is taking place. For these reasons, the objective of this M. Sc. thesis was to integrate environmental aspects in the product development process at Kockums AB by designing and proposing a way of implementing a tool, document, and/or method. Environmental product requirements that Kockums AB is demanded to fulfill mainly derives from customers, classification societies, laws and legislations, and themselves. The Hong Kong Convention has been adapted, in 2009, but is yet to enter into force. Ship recycling is covered by the convention,and an ‘Inventory of Hazardous Materials’ has to be provided from the ship builder, and hence this is the main aspect for Kockums AB to consider. Naval ships are, however, excluded from the Hong Kong Convention. Kockums AB does not have a routine on how to handle environmental requirements nor are environmental aspects included in their product development process. Consequently, Kockums AB’senvironmental ambition should not be put too high and rather aim at follow laws. In an empiricalstudy, regarding environmental aspects at Kockums AB, difficulties were identified. Lack of environmental knowledge, communication problems, and misunderstandings regarding the ambiguous term environment showed to be most notable. The three most prominent success factors for asuccessful integration of ecodesign, from the conducted literature review and empirical findings, are education for employees, existence of an environmental champion, and top management support. A Long-term Environmental Action Plan (LEAP), which took the success factors into account and contains  18 Actions, was developed for Kockums AB, and is the ultimate result of this research. The LEAP was developed in accordance with ISO 14006, a new standard for incorporation of ecodesign in Environmental Management Systems, with the aim of reducing adverse environmental impactsthroughout a product’s lifecycle. Moreover, the proposed way of implementing the LEAP was based on a ”Plan, Do, Check, Act” methodology from Product-Oriented Environmental Management Systems (POEMS). POEMS focus on a product’s environmental efficiency throughout its lifecycle, by a systematic integration of ecodesign in the company’s strategies and practices, and hence continual improvements. This way of implementation should be familiar to Kockums AB because the company is certified according to ISO 14001, where continual improvement of environmental performance is a key factor. The proposed LEAP includes tools, documents, and methods that are to be used in daily work and product development at Kockums AB. It is a step towards environmentally conscious design and enhanced environmental knowledge at Kockums AB. Additionally, {{as a result of the}} LEAP, the expectation is that environmental conscious mindsets of employees arise...|$|E

A mathematic programming model is formulated to minimise the total rental cost while satisfying the <b>customer's</b> <b>shipping</b> requirements. The objective function in the model, however, is a non-decreasing piece-wise linear one. The model is changed into a mixed integer linear programming model by introducing two new sets of variables, and the new model can be solved by employing many mathematical programming software packages available today.
