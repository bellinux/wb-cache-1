30|$|Data were <b>coded</b> <b>to</b> {{categories}} and levels using NVivo© in a three-part process to answer our first two research questions. During the initial coding process, {{interviews with the}} SEC director(s) and staff were <b>coded</b> <b>to</b> the three functional categories shown in Table 3. Interview data was augmented with artifact and website data describing center functions. Faculty interviews were then <b>coded</b> <b>to</b> these categories to corroborate engagement with these center functions. Likewise, upper administrative interview comments were <b>coded</b> <b>to</b> “the role of the center,” aggregating comments describing the perceived role of {{the center and the}} value of center functions in the areas outlined in Table 3. Following this initial process, center functions with faculty and departmental engagement were identified and linked to administrative comments, both specific and broad, addressing these same areas. Properties and dimensions were developed for each of these areas (services, programs, research) from the <b>coded</b> data <b>to</b> obtain a rich contextualized description for individual SECs, which was used to identify themes and patterns across cases.|$|R

Subsequently, the Union Cabinet of India amended the <b>code</b> <b>to</b> allow limited usage. The code was amended once more in 2005 to allow some additional use including adaptations on certain forms of clothing.
