Any Senator has the right to call a <b>closed</b> <b>session</b> as long as the motion is seconded.|$|R
25|$|On occasion, the Senate may go {{into what}} is called a secret or <b>closed</b> <b>session.</b> During a <b>closed</b> <b>session,</b> the chamber doors are closed, cameras are turned off, and the {{galleries}} are completely cleared of anyone not sworn to secrecy, not instructed in the rules of the <b>closed</b> <b>session,</b> or not essential to the <b>session.</b> <b>Closed</b> <b>sessions</b> are rare and usually held only when the Senate is discussing sensitive subject matter such as information critical to national security, private communications from the president, or deliberations during impeachment trials. A senator may call for and force a <b>closed</b> <b>session</b> if the motion is seconded by at least one other member, but an agreement usually occurs beforehand. If the Senate does not approve release of a secret transcript, the transcript is stored in the Office of Senate Security and ultimately sent to the national archives. The proceedings remain sealed indefinitely until the Senate votes to remove the injunction of secrecy. In 1973 the House adopted a rule that all committee sessions should be open unless a majority on the committee voted for a <b>closed</b> <b>session.</b>|$|R

In May 2008, the exchange also implemented a closing auction session {{to run from}} 4:00pm to 4:10pm, with a similar pricing mechanism as the opening auction; however, this resulted in significant fluctuations in the closing prices of stocks and suspicions of market manipulation. Initially, the exchange proposed limiting price fluctuations in the auction sessions to 2%; in the end, they removed the <b>closing</b> <b>session</b> entirely in March 2009.|$|E
25|$|Sessions of play often {{influence}} tactics a team might employ in a match, {{especially as}} natural light varies {{over the course}} of the day, and the pitch wears {{over the course of}} a match, whether one-day or Test. For example, cricketing teams usually choose opening Test batsmen who can navigate opening bowlers, who often bowl aggressively in the first session of a Test match. Similarly, Test teams often deploy a nightwatchman during the <b>closing</b> <b>session</b> of a day in Test matches so as not to lose important wickets in conditions that might be difficult for a batsman to manage.|$|E

2500|$|During {{a special}} session at the XX International AIDS Conference, 2014, Geldof {{referred}} to sex workers as [...] "hookers", {{for which he was}} subsequently criticised. Christian Vega, a sex workers' rights activist and a member of Victoria's peer-only Victorian Sex Industry Network (VIXEN), blamed speakers including Geldof for their use of pejorative language, which perpetuated the very stigmas that are among the key barriers to HIV prevention. Geldof responded to the criticism during the <b>closing</b> <b>session</b> of the conference: [...] "I read today in the paper that my talk yesterday was littered with profanities – fuck them." [...] In Geldof's view, rights-based language hampered HIV prevention, and he defended using terms such as [...] "hookers" [...] and [...] "": [...] "Let’s not get distracted by diversionary language. Let’s call it as it is." [...] In a radio show after the conference on Joy 94.9, Vega dismissed Geldof’s view that rights-based language {{was a waste of time}} as “ridiculous”, as it served as an important tool to challenge stigma and discrimination, particularly within an HIV context.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1928 Xiang {{wrote letters}} to Joseph Stalin and Nikolai Bukharin, denouncing the CCP. These letters won {{attention}} of Stalin and Bukharin, who became concerned at what Xiang pointed out. Then in March 1928, the Comintern asked the CCP to hold its 6th National Congress in Moscow, which should have reshuffled {{the leadership of the}} CCP. With the opening of this congress on June 18, Xiang was appointed as the chairman of the opening and closing sessions, which implied that a promotion was at hand. In this congress, Xiang attacked both the leftism of Qu Qiubai and the rightism of Zhang Guotao, essentially claiming himself to be the only orthodox representative of Chinese revolution. The day before the <b>closing</b> <b>session</b> of this congress, Pavel Mif, the minister of the Eastern Department of the Comintern, also known as the president of Moscow Sun Yat-sen University and mentor of 28 Bolsheviks, on behalf of the Comintern brought forward a list of candidates for the Central Committee of the CCP. The Central Committee at that time consisted of 36 members, with 22 workers among them, and stressed obedience to Comintern policy. Xiang was elected as member of the Politburo and made General Secretary of the CCP, which was no great surprise. This ending was a certainty from the beginning, for of the 84 delegates attending this congress, 50 of them were proletariat, compared with the previous congress in 1926, when 71 of the 82 delegates were intellectuals. So it was no wonder that Zhou Enlai would express his discontent by saying there were [...] "a lot of mobs" [...] in this 6th National Congress.|$|E
