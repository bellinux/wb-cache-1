50|$|By {{the time}} Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia {{disintegrated}} {{during the early}} 1990s, Tucaković was sure {{he wanted to make}} a movie about Ray's stay in the country. In Venice at the film festival, he met with Wim Wenders, Ray's admirer and good friend who gave Ray a part in his 1977 film The American Friend and also chronicled his death in documentary Lightning Over Water. Wenders expressed interest in contributing to Tucaković's project, but nothing ever came of it due to the inability of Bandur Film-the production company behind the planned project, to access EU <b>co-production</b> <b>funds.</b>|$|R
500|$|BBC America {{signed on}} to provide <b>co-production</b> <b>funding</b> in March 2006. The {{producers}} regularly met with Moffat for brainstorming sessions. Cameron's assistant took notes from these conversations, after which they would look over the notes and start the process again. The producers invited Moffat to [...] "write anything", {{with the intention of}} cutting the material back later. However, they were reluctant to cut material once they saw it on the page. The first episode starts with Jackman already knowing about his alter ego. Because the plot of Jekyll begins after the story has developed for the characters, Nesbitt says that the show feels like it is a second series.|$|R
50|$|Hartwig {{began the}} next phase of his career in 1962 with Hong Kong Hot Harbor. Hartwig not only found it cheaper to film in Near Eastern and Oriental {{locations}} but his films received international <b>co-production</b> <b>funding</b> from other European nations. His films were released by two major German film companies Gloria Film and Constantin Film, who were attracted by Hartwig's subjects of adventure, Eurospy films and works by popular German authors such as a film based on the adventures of the pre-World War II pulp fiction hero Rolf Torring that was reprinted in paperback after the war, and Westerns based on the works of Friedrich Gerstäcker.|$|R
5000|$|After {{working on}} several {{productions}} in Spain, director Jesús Franco sought out financial backing in Germany.

The title for the film was found at the home of Pier A. Caminnecci where Franco found a book titled Necronomicon. The story was only three pages long, so Franco fused the story with a previous film script he had worked on.|$|R

5|$|The {{scale of}} Our Friends in the North {{required}} BBC Two controller Michael Jackson to devote {{a budget of}} £8 million to the production, which was half of his channel's drama serials budget for the entire year. Producer Charles Pattinson attempted to gain <b>co-production</b> <b>funding</b> from overseas broadcasters, but none was interested. Pattinson believed {{it was because the}} story was so much about Britain and had limited appeal to other countries. BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm which sells its programmes overseas, offered only £20,000 of funding towards the production. The speaking cast of Our Friends in the North numbered 160; more than 3,000 extras were used, and filming took place across 40 weeks, from November 1994 until September 1995.|$|R
50|$|The serial was {{broadcast}} in the United Kingdom on BBC1 in 1986 on Sunday nights from 16 November to 21 December with later PBS and cable television showings in the United States. It won a Peabody Award in 1989. It ranks 20th on the British Film Institute's {{list of the}} 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, as voted by industry professionals in 2000. It {{was included in the}} 1992 Dennis Potter retrospective at the Museum of Television & Radio and became a permanent addition to the Museum's collections in New York and Los Angeles.

The film was financed by Constantin Film, of which Eichinger was the former CEO; billionaire Gisela Oeri and VIP Medienfonds. Perfume is Oeri's first investment into a film and she also served as a co-producer. The film received €200,000 in funding from the German Federal Film Board (FFA)'s German–French Agreement fund.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the EU <b>funded</b> <b>COBO</b> project, {{consequences}} of fish farm activities on bio-geochemical processes in surface sediments of a Northern fjord (Loch Creran, Scotland) has been studied. Seven cores in May and three cores in August 2006 were collected to study early diagenesis processes and benthic fluxes. Each core was extruded, pore waters were extracted and analyzed for nutrients (NH 3, NO 3, NO 2, PO 4, Si(OH) 4, TCO 2), metals (Fe, Mn) and sulphates; diffusive fluxes at the sediment-water interface were calculated. Preliminary results show that the area, affected by fish farm wastes, is characterized by more intensive early diagenesis benthic processes (from 2 to 4 times more than unaffected area) due to higher reactive organic matter inputs to the sediment. Seasonal variations with increased diagenetic processes in summer were also recorded. In spring and in summer both, sediments from the impacted area and the control site are affected by strong bio-irrigation processes. Calculated benthic fluxes reflect the early diagenesis patterns with more intensive nutrient fluxes to the overlying water in the fish farm affected area and in the summer season...|$|R
25|$|The serial was {{produced}} in-house by the BBC with some <b>co-production</b> <b>funding</b> from United States PBS broadcaster WGBH. It was shown on BBC One, on Thursdays at 8.00 p.m. and Fridays at 8.30 p.m., following the BBC's most popular programme — EastEnders — {{in an attempt}} to attract more viewers, particularly those of a young age. An hour-long episode started the series on Thursday 27 October 2005. Afterwards, episodes were shown twice weekly — aside from there being no episode broadcast on Friday 18 November due to the annual Children in Need charity telethon — and were thirty minutes in length. The serial was designed to air in the format of a soap opera; this was somewhat experimental for the television drama genre, where conventionally they would be an hour long. BBC One showed omnibus editions of each week's episodes on the Sunday following first broadcast.|$|R
50|$|As well {{as being}} {{broadcast}} by ITV in the UK, the series was also seen overseas, particularly in the United States, where the episodes initially ran on PBS stations in the Mystery! strand. Later series gained <b>co-production</b> <b>funding</b> from Boston PBS broadcaster WGBH. The shows have also been transmitted on two US cable television stations, Disney Channel and A&E Network, and on CBC in Canada. In the UK, the series has often been repeated: on Granada Plus; on ITV3; and on BBC Two, which ran the complete series on Saturday afternoons from 2003 to 2005. This makes {{it one of the}} very few programmes originally produced by an ITV company for broadcast on their own channel to have subsequently been shown on the BBC. In March 2006, the series returned to its original channel for the first time in over a decade, as part of the daytime television line-up on weekday afternoons.|$|R
5000|$|The serial was {{announced}} in 2001, with Alan Bleasdale as the writer. Granada Television's controller of drama Andy Harries could secure only £750,000 for each hour of Henry VIII from ITV, so had to attract <b>co-production</b> <b>funding</b> from other companies. He approached the American CBS network for the money. CBS executives wanted to replace Helena Bonham Carter with Sarah Michelle Gellar and dub all of the actors' voices with American accents. Harries declined CBS's funding and got the money from Powercorp, WGBH Boston and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation instead. The final budget was £5.2 million. Bleasdale had originally scripted an opening scene that featured Henry confronting the devil in hell. ITV's director of drama commissioning Nick Elliott told Harries, [...] "I'm not having the devil on ITV. You'd better ring him and tell him I'm not paying £5 million to have the devil on ITV." [...] Bleasdale then quit the project. He was replaced by Peter Morgan, who had written the Granada drama The Jury.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, once a feature-length {{script was}} in hand, Shalhoub {{began looking for}} a {{producer}} and production company. Through a mutual friend, he approached producer Brian Cox at Distant Horizon, an international film financing company headed by Anant Singh and known for taking a stand on political and social issues in films such as the Oscar-nominated Yesterday. Cox read the script and immediately saw the relevance and timeliness of the project. The company optioned {{the rights to the}} project, which they considered the first true Arab-American film, and Cox began to develop the script further with the filmmakers. Eventually, <b>co-production</b> <b>funding</b> was sought through Zahra Pictures, a company run by independent producer Ahmad Zahra, and backed by investor Mohannad Malas, which had made its name specializing in films focusing on Muslim and interfaith issues. Next, line producer Jeff Kirshbaum was brought on to oversee day-to-day production. So, with the production team, the script, and the full funding in place, the film was slated to begin principal photography in the summer of 2006.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to a cast featuring American, Australian, British and Dutch actors, attempting to handle an international <b>co-production</b> <b>funded</b> by multiple sources who all {{wanted to take the}} film in different directions overwhelmed Verhoeven, who had also not storyboarded the film in a bid to achieve a [...] "looser visual approach". There were a number of delays and disagreements because of the subsequent improvisational style of filming; many members of the cast and crew also arrived and left when they pleased to party on a local beach. One of the most notable disagreements was between Verhoeven and Hauer, who wanted to cultivate a reputation for playing heroic characters rather than villains, as he did in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982). This was at odds with Verhoeven's intent to portray the moral ambiguity of its characters and the Middle Ages as a [...] "stinking time in which to live" [...] to distance it from typical medieval fantasy depictions of the period. This caused a bitter rift to develop between the two, who have not worked together since.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to briefly examine and contrast the two audiovisual productions of Swedish author Stieg Larsson’s first novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo from the perspective that the two films were prepared, shot and finalized within vastly dissimilar production economies. The rationale behind the examination is that it seemingly reveals certain paradoxes that appear to challenge received forms of thinking regarding the workings of the audiovisual industries in Europe and global Hollywood respectively. In addition, the comparison is meant to underline how Europe’s expanding landscape of public film financing, including state funds, regional <b>funds,</b> transnational <b>co-production</b> <b>funds,</b> the Media and Eurimage programmes – as well as increasingly partaking television companies – has fashioned increasingly intricate but at the same time cunning financing structures in the name of economic efficiency. Meanwhile, and perhaps paradoxically, a brief assessment of the making of David Fincher’s Hollywood version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), shot on somewhat the same locations as the Swedish film and with a partly Swedish crew and cast reveals a surprisingly lenient production agenda, at least in a relative sense...|$|R
5000|$|Jeffrey Tayor of Stagescreen Productions had {{the idea}} of a modern version of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in the mid-1990s. He {{attempted}} to get it produced in the United States three times, but all three attempts fell through for various reasons. He returned to England from the west coast of the United States and joined with Hartswood Films when Elaine Cameron was scouting for ideas for a supernatural thriller.

Ann Wingate, Frank Doelger and Tracey Scoffield are producers, and Andy Harries, Christine Langan and Kennedy are executive producers. HBO Films is producing, with <b>co-production</b> <b>funding</b> coming from BBC Films. Morgan signed on to direct the film—making his directorial debut—as the director of The Deal and The Queen Stephen Frears was [...] "Blaired out". In June 2009, shortly before filming began, Morgan pulled out of directing the film. Morgan's agent told a Daily Telegraph diary that Morgan wanted to concentrate on writing and producing, but did not rule out directing in future. Costumes were designed by Consolata Boyle, whose work on The Queen won acclaim and awards. After a week of read-throughs and rehearsals, filming began on July 20, 2009 and ran until September 4. Filming locations included Langley Park, the Emirates Stadium and the Westminster Central Hall. Brocket Hall and the Loseley Park mansion doubled as Chequers, the Prime Minister's country retreat. Scenes set in the Oval Office were filmed on a set built on E Stage at Pinewood Studios. E Stage also housed a recreation of the White House gardens and colonnade outside the Oval Office. Several other locations were used, {{in conjunction with the}} UK Film Council's regional agencies Film London, Screen East, and Screen South.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} also affected, and nearly cancelled, because of funding difficulties. Until the mid-1980s the New Zealand tax system gave generous {{tax breaks to}} investors in New Zealand films. Under the fourth Labour government's Rogernomics reforms these were abolished, causing The Navigator to lose funding six weeks before {{principal}} photography was due to begin in 1986. The film was delayed for a year, until it became the first Australia-New Zealand <b>co-production,</b> partially <b>funded</b> by the Australian Film Commission. Australian critics regarded the film as [...] "essentially New Zealand" [...] although Ward does not see it as being specifically tied to New Zealand.|$|R
25|$|Because of {{financing}} problems, the filming {{did not start}} as planned in 2004 but was delayed until August 2005. In this month {{it was announced that}} Black Book received about €2,000,000 support from the Netherlands Public Broadcasting, the <b>CoBO</b> <b>Fund,</b> and the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. There were also several foreign investors, which made the film a Belgian, British, and German coproduction.

The three episodes were filmed in reverse order of their broadcast.Gatiss says that they wanted to [...] "fetishise modern London {{in the way that the}} period versions fetishise Victorian London". Production was based at Hartswood Films' Cardiff production unit, Hartswood Films West, which was opened in late 2009 to take advantage of the BBC's planned Cardiff Bay [...] "drama village". Production of the first two series was based at Upper Boat Studios, where Doctor Who had been produced. Cardiff was more economical than in London, with some good matches for parts of London. Some architecture could not be faked, so location shooting in the English capital was necessary. The location shots for 221B Baker Street were filmed at 187 North Gower Street - Baker Street was impractical because of heavy traffic, and the number of things labelled [...] "Sherlock Holmes", which would need to be disguised. Executive producer Beryl Vertue explains how it was important to design the entirety of Sherlock's flat as a contemporary set, yet still convey his eccentricity. He would not, she says, live somewhere [...] "too suburban" [...] or [...] "too modern".|$|R
