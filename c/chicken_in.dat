5|$|Sanders {{was unhappy}} with the 35 minutes it took to prepare his <b>chicken</b> <b>in</b> an iron frying pan, {{but he refused to}} deep fry the chicken, which he {{believed}} lowered the quality of the product. If he pre-cooked the <b>chicken</b> <b>in</b> advance of orders, there was sometimes wastage at day's end. In 1939, the first commercial pressure cookers were released onto the market, mostly designed for steaming vegetables. Sanders bought one, and modified it into a pressure fryer, which he then used to fry chicken. The new method reduced production time to be comparable with deep frying, while, in the opinion of Sanders, retaining the quality of pan-fried chicken.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of an Escherichia coli (E. coli) aroA-live vaccine {{in the prevention}} of colibacillosis <b>in</b> <b>chickens</b> following intratracheal challenge with a virulent strain of E. coli O 78 was investigated. Thirty-six, one day old broiler chickens were divided into 3 groups of 12 each. <b>Chickens</b> <b>in</b> each group were randomly divided into 2 replicates. The <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> group 1 that were not vaccinated and challenged served as a negative control. The <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> group 2 that were not vaccinated but received E. coli serotype O 78 served as a positive control. The <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> group 3 were vaccinated by the oral route at 5 days of age with E. coli aroA-vaccine and challenged with E. coli serotype O 78. All the <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> groups 2 and 3 were challenged intratracheally at 4 weeks of age with 0. 5 ml (1. 2 x 109 cfu/ml) per dose of E. coli O 78. The chickens were monitored for 7 days after infection for feed conversion ratio (FCR), and the post-mortem pathology was assessed. The results revealed that the vaccine tends to prevent E. coli infection. The <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> group 3 tended to show lower pathological findings including airsacculitis, pericarditis, perihepatitis, peritonitis and arthritis than the <b>chickens</b> <b>in</b> group 2 but the FCR was not different in each group (p> 0. 05) ...|$|R

5|$|The first dish {{known to}} have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the Middle Ages. However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their <b>chicken</b> <b>in</b> fat (though without seasoning). Meanwhile, a number of West African peoples had traditions of {{seasoned}} fried chicken (though battering and cooking the <b>chicken</b> <b>in</b> palm oil). Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South. Prior to the Second World War, fried chicken was often very expensive and was only enjoyed on special occasions. In the late 1900s and early 2000s, however, fried chicken has been mass-produced and the price of the dish has gone down significantly.|$|E

The 1976 contract was restored, including the 1.5 mile outlet exclusivity zone, while the parent company gained greater control over national advertising. Novak also axed the Colonel's Rotisserie Gold product and introduced a new non-fried item called the Tender Roast. Tender Roast was served by piece, as with the fried <b>chicken,</b> <b>in</b> contrast with the rotisserie product, which had been sold in quarter, half or whole chicken portions. Afterwards, Novak oversaw ten fiscal quarters of consecutive growth at KFC North America.

In 1960 the company had around 200 franchised restaurants; by 1963 this had grown to over 600, making it the largest fast food operation in the United States. In 1963, Sanders met John Y.

Sanders instead proposed the sale of the company, as business skills did not come naturally to him, and he lacked an obvious or willing heir among his relatives.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Brown {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with recording artist Kenny Rogers, co-founding and serving as CEO of Kenny Rogers Roasters, an international chain of wood-roasted chicken restaurants. The founding of Kenny Rogers Roasters {{was part of a}} larger movement in the restaurant industry toward healthier, take-home offerings. Roasters immediately found itself in competition with Boston Chicken (later known as Boston Market) and several smaller roasted chicken chains. Kentucky Fried Chicken also introduced a roasted chicken line of products called Rotisserie Gold to compete with Roasters and Boston <b>Chicken.</b> <b>In</b> December 1992, Clucker's, a smaller player in the roasted chicken market, sued Kenny Rogers Roasters, claiming the chain had copied its recipes and menus. The lawsuit continued until Roasters purchased a majority stake in Cluckers in August 1994. Brown then took Roasters public and grew it to a chain of more than 1,000 restaurants before selling his interest in the franchise to the Malaysia-based Berjaya Group in 1996.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the cotton {{industry}} was booming. The crop made up 69% of the agricultural business in the region. Livestock production was booming, as was poultry production, especially <b>chicken.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the shipping of agricultural goods and livestock was the other main business in Cooper. The First National Bank was rebuilt in 1909 and became an important factor in Cooper's economy. In the 1910s, potatoes become {{an important part of the}} economy due to the sudden drop in the livestock business. In 1926, the cotton crop failed and Cooper's economy plummeted. Many of Cooper's inhabitants became deep in debt as the price of crops plummeted. The lumber businesses had exhausted the regions resources, forcing most of them to go out of business. Many people moved away to find new work. The local economy stabilized in the mid-1930s, and cotton, potato, and corn production began to rise. The growing of oats, however, had ended. In addition, the railroad going through Cooper had failed a few years before, so the shipping industry in Cooper was struggling. Cotton and alfalfa carried Cooper's economy through the 1950s and 1960s, until the shift to the growing of wheat in the 1970s. Cooper reported 60 businesses in the 1970s, more than half of which were dairies. During the 1980s and 1990s, Cooper's economy shifted to the manufacturing and shipping of local goods, and in 1991, Cooper had 70 businesses.|$|E
