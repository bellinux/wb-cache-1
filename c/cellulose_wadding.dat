2500|$|In the 20th century, the {{disposable}} diaper was conceived. In the 1930s, Robinsons of Chesterfield {{had what}} were labeled [...] "Destroyable Babies Napkins" [...] listed in their catalogue for the wholesale market. In 1944, Hugo Drangel of the Swedish paper company Pauliström suggested a conceptual design which would entail the placing of {{sheets of paper}} tissue (<b>cellulose</b> <b>wadding)</b> inside the cloth diaper and rubber pants. However, <b>cellulose</b> <b>wadding</b> was rough against the skin and crumbled into balls when exposed to moisture.|$|E
2500|$|In 1947, Scottish {{housewife}} Valerie Hunter Gordon started {{developing and}} making Paddi, a 2-part system {{consisting of a}} disposable pad (made of <b>cellulose</b> <b>wadding</b> covered with cotton wool) worn inside an adjustable plastic garment with press-studs/snaps. Initially, she used old parachutes for the garment. She applied for the patent in April 1948, and it was granted for the UK in October 1949. [...] Initially, the big manufacturers were unable to see the commercial possibilities of disposable nappies. In 1948, Gordon made over 400 Paddis herself using her sewing machine at the kitchen table. Her husband had unsuccessfully approached several companies for help until {{he had a chance}} meeting with Sir Robert Robinson at a business dinner. In November 1949 Valerie Gordon signed a contract with Robinsons of Chesterfield who then went into full production. In 1950, Boots UK agreed to sell Paddi in all their branches. In 1951 the Paddi patent was granted for the USA and worldwide. Shortly after that, Playtex and several other large international companies tried unsuccessfully to buy out Paddi from Robinsons. Paddi was very successful for many years until the advent of 'all in one' diapers.|$|E

5000|$|The Brenneke slug was {{developed}} by the German gun and ammunition designer Wilhelm Brenneke (1865-1951) in 1898. The original Brenneke slug is a solid lead slug with ribs cast onto the outside, much like a rifled Foster slug. There is a plastic, felt or <b>cellulose</b> fiber <b>wad</b> attached to the base that remains attached after firing. This wad serves both as a gas seal and as a form of drag stabilization. The [...] "ribs" [...] impart a small amount of rotation to the projectile as it travels down the bore. This rotation does not impart gyroscopic stabilization, rather it improves accuracy by correcting for manufacturing irregularities. [...] Additionally, the ribs decrease contact surface with the bore, reducing friction and increasing velocity. The ribs also deform through the choke more readily than a solid slug would, thus reducing pressure and wear on the choke to safe levels.|$|R
5000|$|Paper - Paper can be {{manually}} or mechanically wadded up {{and used}} as a cushioning material. Heavier grades of paper provide more weight-bearing ability than old newspapers. Creped <b>cellulose</b> <b>wadding</b> is also available. (Movers often wrap objects with several layers of Kraft paper or embossed pulp before putting them into boxes.) ...|$|E
50|$|From 1888 {{they began}} {{manufacturing}} paper in Ortmann, {{and then at}} Wattens paper mill. From 1925 Hungarian inventor Boris Aivaz, who had patented {{the process of making}} cigarette filters from crepe paper, with some variants including <b>cellulose</b> <b>wadding,</b> experimented at the Ortmann plant. Aivaz produced the first cigarette filter from 1927 in co-operation with Bunzl's Filtronic subsidiary, but up take was low {{due to a lack of}} machinery to produce cigarettes with the filtered tip.|$|E
5000|$|In 1947, {{after having}} her third child, Valerie Hunter Gordon started {{developing}} {{a product that}} could prevent the hours of drudgery and wasted resources spent on washing, drying and ironing the traditional towelling nappy. [...] "I just didn't want to wash them," [...] she explained. [...] "It was awful labour." [...] Valerie created her nappies, being a two-part system, consisting of a biodegradable disposable pad (made of <b>cellulose</b> <b>wadding</b> covered with cotton wool) worn inside an adjustable waterproof garment (the PADDI) with press-studs that was not thrown out.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} thermal {{insulation}} scenarios on the hygrothermal balance of traditional walls has been investigated. In three pre-World war II houses {{subject to a}} global thermal retrofit, instrumentation devices were used on-site to monitor the interior and exterior climates, and the temperature and humidity at different points inside the walls. These measurements were made {{before and after the}} retrofitting. Then a comparison was done between the hygrothermal behaviour of the old wall and the insulated wall. Based on the measures, dynamic hygrothermal simulation has been performed with a commercial tool (Wufi 2 D) to anticipate the evolution of moisture inside the insulated walls over ten years. The cases analysed are a brick house retrofitted with exterior insulation and two half timbering houses retrofitted with interior insulation, i. e. <b>cellulose</b> <b>wadding</b> and moisture control barrier and wood fibre insulation board respectively...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work {{test the}} {{feasibility}} and characterize the thermohygric properties of composite materials, realized with eco-friendly {{raw materials and}} designed to make suspended ceilings or interior partition walls. Several raw materials are considered: recycled paper (granules or <b>cellulose</b> <b>wadding)</b> and wood fibers. Aggregates or fibers are bonded with organic or mineral binder. One of the binder considered is starch, due to its availability in Ivory Coast (cassava flour). The calcium sulfate hemihydrate is also used for comparison. The density of the produced composites ranges from 400 to 1200 kg/m 3 depending on formulation. The thermal conductivity increases proportionally with the density and ranges from 0. 09 to 0. 5 W/(m. K). The characterization of hygric behavior {{is based on the}} measurement of moisture buffer value (MBV) [1]. The hydric performances of the composites made of mineral binder goes from moderate (MBV around 1 g/(m 2. %RH)) to excellent (MBV andgt; 2 g/(m 2. %RH)). The moisture buffer value of the paper granules-starch composite is also excellent (MBV andgt; 2 g/(m 2. %RH)) © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
