40|$|The core of {{the present}} study is to analyse the <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> of public transit systems in Italy, {{investigating}} the way subsidization mechanisms and network characteristics affect the x-inefficiency levels of firms. The analysis uses a seven-year (1993 - 1999) unbalanced panel of 45 Italian public-owned companies run under two different regulatory schemes (cost-plus or fixed-price). A stochastic cost frontier is estimated by applying the Battese and Coelli (1995) econometric model, which allows the inefficiency measures to depend on observable factors that are firm-specific and can vary over time. The results provide some insights regarding the appropriate mechanism of granting subsidies, and in turn they are useful for assessing the ongoing reform of the sector. The evidence indicates that there is scope for transport policy to increase <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Efforts</b> have to be intensified in the twofold direction of replacing cost-plus subsidization mechanisms with high-powered incentive schemes and improving exogenous operating conditions of the network. The latter goal could be pursued by acting on factors such as the road space allocation (exclusive lanes for trams and buses, parking and private traffic regulation), or the provision of incentives for the use of public modes.

Similar to other countries in the region, the accreditation process in the country is initiated by the private sector and is also voluntary, which adheres to the nature of the academe. Though it is a way of fostering academic freedom and motivating some institutions to compete, this could result in complacency in others.

By considering a subsystem corresponding to each period, we have network system with a parallel structure of T subsystem where each subsystem has q processes connected in series. Using the proposed multi-period DEA model and also the mathematical relationships between the global <b>cost</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of the total system, its subsystems and its processes, we measure the multi-period global <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> of network system in three different ways.

The object of analysis is not provider efficiency, but instead the relative efficiency of political organizations or different contractual arrangements. The thesis focuses on: 1) the measurement of <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency,</b> 2) the investigation of potential trade-offs between quantity of health care services and the quality of care, and 3) the exploration of determinants of <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The first essay investigates the relative <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the 21 Swedish county councils - how the councils fulfil their responsibility of providing and financing health care for their residents on the basis of need. Two models are estimated: one focusing on a traditional productivity measure and the other on quality in terms of health-related outcomes. Efficiency is estimated using non-parametric data envelopment analysis (DEA). The population weighted DEA-scores are 0. 951 and 0. 953 in the two models. The results also indicate that quantity and quality of care are complements {{in the production}} process. Councils which are net receivers in the equalization grant system have lower efficiency scores in both models. The second essay investigates the <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> of Swedish municipalities in the delivery of care for the elderly. The first objective is to obtain a measure of <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency,</b> the second is to quantify the sources of <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the third is to explore the relationship between <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> and indicators of quality of care. It is based on a cross-sectional dataset consisting of 272 municipalities. <b>Cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> is estimated with a stochastic frontier cost function, using the modelling approach of Battese and Coelli (1995). The estimated average cost inefficiency is as high as 46 percent. Our empirical results also show that the share of private provision, rural location and small scale of operations are associated with higher efficiency. Furthermore, more educated staff is associated with greater efficiency. Finally, favourable results concerning outcome quality indicators, such as a lower prevalence of fall injuries, are associated with higher efficiency. This seems to indicate that there is no trade-off between <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> and quality (outcome indicators) in Swedish care of the elderly. The third essay provides an analysis of the evolution of <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> in public contracting of primary care during the first year after the primary care reform in Stockholm county council. A key element of the 2008 reform is the introduction of active individual listing and free choice of suppliers, where reimbursement follows the patient. The analysis is based on data from all the 147 primary care centres that delivered services during the period 2007 - 2008 and performed by stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). We analyze whether <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> is influenced by different market characteristics and contractual arrangements. The relationship between <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> and quality of care is investigated by including measures of patient satisfaction. The results show that <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> in quantitative terms improved substantially. In addition, it seems that the increase in <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> was not at the expense of patients’ experiences, nor did patients utilize other forms of care to a greater extent.

However, in some cases, the inputs of DMUs have negative values with positive costs. This paper defines the <b>cost</b> and allocative <b>efficiencies</b> for DMUs with negative data, then demonstrates that the defined <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> with negative data is equal to the product of allocative and RDM efficiencies, and then extends the definition of efficiencies to DMUs with negative data and different unit costs.|$|R

This paper investigates scale economies and <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> in the Irish life insurance industry by using the translog cost function and distribution-free method. Increasing returns to scale {{are found in the}} industry but the magnitude of cost economies varies with firm size. This study indicates that firms with larger market shares are more likely to exhibit <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Furthermore, this study shows that bancassurance firms are more cost efficient than other types of insurers in the Irish life insurance industry, which provides new insights into the <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> of bancassurance. bancassurance; cost efficiency; economies of scale; firm size; life insurance; Ireland. ...|$|R

Populasi dari penelitian ini adalah Koperasi Pegawai Republik Indonesia (KPRI) yang terdaftar pada DINPERINDAGKOP and UMKM dari tahun 2008 sampai 2009. 97 KPRI dari 7 kota dipilih secara random sebagai sampel. Data dianalisis dengan menggunakan {{descriptive statistics}} dan multiple regression. Hasilnya memperlihatkan bahwa solvability, <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> and size mempengaruhi economic rentability; liquidity tidak mempengaruhi economic rentability; dan liquidity yang simultan, solvability, <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> and size mempengaruhi economic rentability.

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} Property-Liability {{insurance}} companies {{as a research}} sample to investigate {{the relation between the}} enhancement of <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the usage of reinsurance and financial derivatives as risk management tools. The stochastic frontier approach is applied to consider not only the mean of <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency,</b> but also its variance. The sample includes both organizational forms of insurers, namely, stock and mutual insurers. Empirical results show that the use of financial derivatives to manage investment risks contributes to the enhancement of the mean of the <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency,</b> while the use of reinsurance to manage underwriting risks does not. That is, the more a firm uses derivatives to hedge, the higher is the <b>cost</b> <b>efficiency.</b> On the other hand, while both mechanisms of risk management do not show their influences on the volatility of <b>cost</b> (in) <b>efficiency,</b> the ratio surplus to regulatory required risk-based capital (RBC) is a factor driving the variance of <b>cost</b> (in) <b>efficiency</b> of insurance firms...|$|R
