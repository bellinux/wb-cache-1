40|$|Abstract: The authors {{demonstrated}} {{in a previous}} paper that in <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> geometric instability and chatter were essentially the same phenomenon. In this paper a graphical approach developed for metal cutting is extended to <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> {{with the aim of}} explaining certain earlier findings. It has been shown that the additional force components in <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> allow chatter to occur at frequencies well below the natural frequency and give rise to roundness errors previously considered as geometric instability. These additional force components also explain why a flexible wheel does not improve stability in <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding.</b> Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} the higher resultant force with <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> results in a lower minimum stable width compared with conventional cylindrical grinding...|$|E

40|$|A {{prototype}} <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> {{machine was}} modified extensively to operate satisfactorily at high grinding wheel speeds {{and in the}} high rate <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> regime. The principal modifications included the provision of a 75 k. W. d. c., variable speed, main drive motor which enables grinding wheel speeds up to 120 m/s to be employed and a coolant supply manifold was designed and manufactured-which was capable of delivering a high velocity coolant stream to the grinding zone. In addition, a measurement system was developed-which-allowed the grinding forces to be monitored and recorded in process. Two solutions for the accepted kinematic model of plunge feed cylindrical grinding are proposed. The general and more accurate solution takes account of the variable grit height and separation of the grinding wheel, whilst the particular and approximate analytical solution makes provision for variable grit separation only. The particular solution enabled parametric studies to be undertaken and allowed comparisons with the solutions proposed by other workers. The trends of theoretical grinding forces were predicted from analysis of the undeformed chip dimensions. The trends indicated two methods of achieving high stock removal rates, firstly, for a constant force value, higher stock removal rates are possible by increasing the grinding wheel speed and infeed-rate. Secondly, at a constant grinding wheel speed, and force level, reducing the workpiece speed and increasing the infeed-rate will yield higher stock removal rates. Experimental results were in agreement with these predictions. An extensive experimental programme investigating plunge feed <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> of ferrous components was undertaken. Results from approximately 300 grinding experiments were used to establish a data bank of grinding parameters {{for a range of}} grinding conditions. High-rate <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> {{has been shown to be}} a feasible first machining process. It has also been shown that the choice of kinematic conditions is important in achieving high stock removal rate grinding. Incorrect choice of kinematic conditions can cause problems of, workpiece burn, grinding vibrations and excessive power demands. Limit charts have been constructed which outline the boundaries to the process in terms of burn, grinding vibration and power limit. Operation between the boundaries is best achieved if the ratio of grinding wheel to workpiece speeds is in the range 90 - 200. The results enable a data based control strategy to be formulated and it is proposed that in process variable kinematics will allow a single cycle roughing and finishing operation on a suitably adapted <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> machine...|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} paper {{describes a}} systematic methodology for empirical modellingand optimization of the plunge <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> process. The assessment of microgeometric quality defining quantity {{is supported by}} post-process surface roughness measurements. The design of grinding factors isbased on response surface methodology, which integrates a design of experiment, regression modelling technique for fitting a model to experimentaldata and basic optimization. Central composite response surface design has been employed to develop a second-order surface roughness model. The model has been fully constructed by determination of its structure and regression coefficients. The final goal of experimental study focuses on determination of optimum <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> system set-up and operating conditions for minimization of surface roughness. The computer-aided single-objective optimization, solved by non-linear programming and genetic algorithm, is applied. The results of two different optimization approaches for determination of optimal operating conditions are compared. Finally, further research directions are presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{kinematic}} {{analysis of the}} plunge <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> process considering a uniform mode of infeed. Computer simulation was carried out initially for an ideally round workpiece and regulating wheel, and the optimum set-up and process parameters such as the workpiece surface speed, the work-blade angle, the included tangent angle, etc., to minimise the out-of-roundness error on the workpiece were obtained. Further using these optimum parameters, the effect of regulating wheel and workpiece profile errors such as steps, lobes and randomness, etc., in governing the roundness error produced on the workpiece were studied. In addition, harmonic analysis of the profile produced on the workpiece was carried out to study in details the profile characteristics such as the amplitude spectrum, the dominant harmonic and the average undulation number. The results reported herein will aid manufacturing shop engineers to select set-up and process parameters properly to improve product accuracy in the plunge <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> process...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to clarify}} the sphere forming {{mechanisms}} in vibration-assisted ball <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding,</b> a new technique for effectively processing balls using ultrasonic vibrations. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the ball rotation motion, geometrical arrangement and stiffness of the whole grinding system, a reliable mechanics model was successfully developed for predicting the sphere forming process. Relevant experiments conducted showed that the model had captured the mechanics and the major sphere forming mechanisms in ball <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding.</b> It {{was found that the}} ball whole surface can be well ground with a high accuracy, while efficiency is much enhanced compared with that in the traditional methods. The ball rotational speed which is controlled by the ultrasonic regulator has a great impact on final sphericity, and the speed controlled by the ultrasonic shoe dominates the whole processing time. To achieve a stable and high precision grinding, the ball needs to rotate rhythmically, and the wheel feed per step and the ball location angle should be controlled in a critical range...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{computer}} simulation of plunge <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> is presented. The key assump-tion {{is that the}} forces on the workpiece equilibrate fast enough to treat the process as a sequence of equilibrium states. Equilibrium forces are calculated at each time step, allowing machine and contact deflections to be accounted for when imposing compatibility upon the workpiece. Machine deflections of the grinding wheel, workblade, and regulating wheel are assumed proportional to the applied forces, with constants obtainable from independent experiments. Contact deflections are calculated with a Hertzian analysis and known material properties. Empirical data relating grinding force to actual depth of cut iteratively ‘close the loop ’ between equilibrium and compatibility. Results of the simulation technique include his-tories of the workpiece shape, apparent and actual depths of cut, all forces on the workpiece, and all contact and machine deflections. It is shown that regenerative lobing {{is influenced by the}} specific grinding energy, and that actual depth of cut might be much lower, and specific grinding energy significantly higher, than in comparable surface grinding processes. It is pointed out that the application of additional, known forces {{to the top of the}} workpiece could allow equilibrium and compatibility in <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> to be controlled...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} {{workers have}} shown the critical importance of the geometrical configuration_ of {{the basic elements of}} the <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> process, on the ability to produce round workpieces. Resonances in the machine tool, may tend, in some cases, to worsen geometric instability, and it is therefore necessary to be able to predict these geometrical instabilities in order to avoid unfavourable operating conditions. The results from this work indicate that it is now possible to present geometric stability charts for the configuration of the process. • Justification for the stability charts is argued by reference to extensive experimentation. Optimum geometrical configurations and process conditions are suggested, by deduction from •theory and experiment. Conclusions are drawn regarding favourable grinding practice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The present authors {{proposed}} a new centerless grinding technique for the fabrication of microscale pin-shaped parts. The new technique uses an ultrasonic vibration shoe whose structure and dimensions was determined in detail by FEM analysis {{instead of a}} regulating wheel as in conventional centerless grinding. The workpiece {{is supported by the}} end face of the shoe and the blade, and the rotational motion is controlled by the micro elliptic motion generated on the end face of the shoe. A shoe was made and installed on an existing centerless grinder to perform actual microscale <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> operations involving a tungsten carbide pin-shaped workpiece 0. 6 mm in diameter and 15 mm in length. The experimental result gave a microscale workpiece 75 µm in diameter and 15 mm in length...|$|E
40|$|An {{advanced}} {{system was}} developed for the intelligent, self-optimising computer numerically controlled grinding of compliant, thin walled cylinders. A study was made of previous developments in the adaptive control of grinding processes. Requirements imposed {{on the design of}} computer control systems by the implementation of adaptive control techniques were considered. A manually controlled <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> machine was automated and the mechanical capabilities of the machine were extended so that productivity was limited by process rather than machine constraints. In-process measurement was implemented to allow a control system to account for variations in process conditions. Experimental work performed with highly compliant workpieces exposed problems of process control that were accounted for by machine cycle design and process optimisation. It was considered that the improvements in productivity achieved by maximising material removal rates were limited for highly compliant workpieces. Therefore, a requirement for improving productivity through the design of appropriate machine cycles was identified. The design of a novel machine cycle eliminated the need for separate rough and finish grinding operations whilst allowing the control system to compensate for the high level of system compliance that was experienced. The benefits and disadvantages of the new machine cycle design were revealed by comparing the performance of the automated machine with that of manually operated machine tools. A conceptual framework for an intelligent control system was created that combined process models, learning strategies, process measurement and adaptive control techniques with an economic data base. The conceptual framework was used as a basis for the development of strategies that improved productivity when grinding highly compliant workpieces by the <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> process. A control system was developed which successfully demonstrated the benefits of the approach. The control system was implemented within a commercial C. N. C. system and was put into production on the shop floor. A modular approach to the design of intelligent control systems for grinding processes is defined...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the efficiency of artificial neural networks and the related metamodels to simulate and identify complex <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> process. Design/methodology/approach: The modelling is founded on the system approach, which is efficiently dealing with the complexity of the grinding process. The unknown process transfer function is identified via artificial neural network that requires fewer assumptions and less precise information about the process modelled than other conventional modelling techniques. The developed metamodel is a response surface (polynomial fit) of the simulated process that is achieved by the computer model. Findings: The metamodel quality is strongly related to the prediction accuracy of the underlying simulation model. The generalisation capability of an artificial neural network is sensitive to the training samples (design of experiments). The predictive ability of a metamodel is comparable to the accuracy of the response surface regression model. Research limitations/implications: Improved simulation model and application of unconventional metamodels (Gaussian process regression) will significantly improve the presented preliminary results. Originality/value: Metamodelling of computer experiments is an expansion of response surface methodology and the classical designs of experiments and represents a new paradigm in empirical modelling of machining operations...|$|E
40|$|With annual global {{sales of}} {{approximately}} $ 5 billion [1], {{tapered roller bearing}} consumers increasingly valued energy efficient products [2]. Two of the world’s largest bearing producers, SKF [3] and Timken [4] promoted energy efficient bearings based on their abilities to grind rollers to reduced radial deviation from round (OOR). Bearing designers, however, {{did not know if}} roller geometries specified placed limitations on roller roundness. Testing under shop floor conditions at Timken, the researcher discovered a positive linear regression between roller nominal diameter and OOR. The basis for the regression was under geometric roller rounding conditions found to exist when through feed <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> tapered rollers, synchronous regulating wheel vibrations transferred at higher amplitude to larger nominal diameter rollers. This research pointed energy efficient bearing design in a new direction. For example, tapered roller bearing designers typically specified rollers of minimum length to reduce problems associated with rolling contact. Bearings assembled from shorter rollers, to retain the same load capacity, required fewer rollers of larger nominal diameter. This research, however, found all things equal larger nominal diameter rollers suffered from increased OOR. Bearings designed to reduce power losses associated with rotational displacements benefited from employing more, smaller nominal diameter rollers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A new {{development}} of hybrid in-process electrical dressing of metal-bonded diamond grinding wheels is proposed in this paper. The electrical dressing method {{is used for}} overcoming {{the limitations of the}} conventional dressing methods available in relation to a super-abrasive wheel because of the hardness of its abrasive grains and the durability of its bonding material. The proposed hybrid in-process electrical dressing method consists of electro-discharge and electro-chemical processes and is implemented with twin copper electrodes and alternating power supplies. The results show that with properly maintained process conditions, a better surface finish is produced by the proposed method compared with traditional rotating SiC wheel dressing. Index Terms — Electro-chemical, electro-discharge, inprocess dressing, metal-bonded diamond grinding wheel. eliminates the need for a carbon brush as a means to deliver the current to the wheel during a dressing process. A combination of electro-chemical and electro-discharge dressing has been developed by Schopf et al. [2] and Ohmori et al. [3]. It suggested that the electro-chemical dressing is assisted by the thermal erosive effect of electrical discharge. The application is implemented for <b>centreless</b> <b>grinding</b> with single electrode supplied with a DC power supply via a pair of brushes. A further improvement is proposed here. The use of twin electrodes [4] and in-process dressing using AC power supplies are implemented. This approach allows electro-chemical and electro-discharge dressings to be performed individually as required, rather than conducted alternating on single electrode. The gap could be set differently according to the requirement of each process. I...|$|E
