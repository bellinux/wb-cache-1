60|$|The woman {{seemed to}} think it {{necessary}} she should feed Snip with a portion of one cake {{that had already been}} counted out for Seth, and to still further tempt the dog's appetite by giving him an inch or more broken from one of the <b>checkerberry</b> sticks, before attending to her duties as clerk, after which she concluded her portion of the transaction by holding out a not over-cleanly hand for the money.|$|E
60|$|We {{have just}} built {{our house in}} rather an out-of-the-way place--on the bank of a river, and {{under the shade of}} a patch of woods which is a veritable remain of quite an ancient forest. The <b>checkerberry</b> and partridge-plum, with their glossy green leaves and scarlet berries, still carpet the ground under its deep shadows; and prince's-pine and other kindred evergreens declare its native wildness,--for these are {{children}} of the wild woods, that never come after plough and harrow have once broken a soil.|$|E
60|$|While we were {{pitching}} {{the camp}} and getting supper, the Indian cut {{the rest of the}} hair from his moose-hide, and proceeded to extend it vertically on a temporary frame between two small trees, half a dozen feet from {{the opposite side of the}} fire, lashing and stretching it with arbor-vitæ bark. Asking for a new kind of tea, he made us some pretty good of the <b>checkerberry,</b> which covered the ground, dropping a little bunch of it tied up with cedar bark into the kettle.|$|E
60|$|That sunny {{hour before}} sundown seemed as long to Sally {{as the whole}} seam of the sheet; for childhood's joys are all pure gold; and as she ran {{up and down the}} white sands, {{shouting}} at every shell she found, or darted up into the overhanging forest for <b>checkerberries</b> and ground-pine, all the sorrows of the morning came no more into her remembrance.|$|R
60|$|Descending {{a little}} lower, Bruin began to bark, and was {{answered}} by the graver bow-wow of the respectable Ben. They soon saw {{the good old}} dog, keeping careful watch over Dandelion, Sweet Fern, Cowslip, and Squash-Blossom. These little people, quite recovered from their fatigue, had set about gathering <b>checkerberries,</b> and now came clambering to meet their playfellows. Thus reunited, the whole party went down through Luther Butler's orchard, and made {{the best of their}} way home to Tanglewood.|$|R
60|$|Now {{they were}} {{completing}} new dressing sacks, and had enjoyed this job very much, as each chose her own material, and suited her own taste in the making. Jill's was white, with tiny scarlet leaves all over it, trimmed with red braid and buttons so like <b>checkerberries</b> she {{was tempted to}} eat them. Molly's was gay, with bouquets of every sort of flower, scalloped all round, and adorned with six buttons, each of a different color, which she thought the last touch of elegance. Merry's, though the simplest, was the daintiest of the three, being pale blue, trimmed with delicate edging, and beautifully made.|$|R
6000|$|Banners of gay tulip-leaves were {{blowing in}} the wind from the lances of reeds held by a troop of elves mounted on mice; a car made of a curled green leaf with <b>checkerberry</b> wheels and {{cushions}} of pink mushrooms stood ready for her, and Trip as maid of honor helped her in. Lady elves on butterflies flew behind, and the Queen's trumpeters marched before making music on their horns. All the people of Elfland lined the way, throwing flowers, waving their hands, and calling, [...] "Farewell, little Eva! Come again! Do not forget us!" [...] till she was out of sight.|$|E
60|$|They {{tried to}} find the woodchuck, but lost their way, and wandered deeper into the great forest till {{they came to a}} rocky place and could go no farther. They climbed up and tumbled down, turned back and went round, looked at the sun and knew it was late, chewed {{sassafras}} bark and <b>checkerberry</b> leaves for supper, and grew more and more worried and tired as hour after hour went by and they saw no end to woods and rocks. Once or twice they heard the hunter's gun far away, and called and {{tried to find}} him.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{a lovely}} {{moonlight}} night. We sat {{on the deck of}} the gliding craft. The moonbeam and the lash of the driver fell softly on the flanks of the off horse, and only the surging of the tow-rope broke the silence. Folair's arm clasped my waist. I suffered it to remain. Placing in my lap a small but not ungrateful roll of <b>checkerberry</b> lozenges, he took the occasion to repeat softly in my ear the words of a motto he had just unwrapped--with its graceful covering of the tissue paper--from a sugar almond. The heart of the wicked little rebel, Mary McGillup, was won! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{will not}} think of such a thing," [...] {{returned}} the peddler, picking the <b>checkerberries</b> that grew on the thin soil where he sat, and very deliberately chewing them, leaves and all, to refresh his mouth. [...] "What progress could they make here, in their heavy boots and spurs, and long swords? No, no--they may go back and turn out the foot, but the horse pass through these defiles, when they can keep the saddle, with fear and trembling. Come, follow me, Captain Wharton; we have a troublesome march before us, but I will bring you where none will think of venturing this night." ...|$|R
60|$|A little knoll {{near the}} house was chosen for a garden-spot; a dense, dark mass of trees above, of bushes in mid-air, and {{of all sorts of}} ferns and wild-flowers and {{creeping}} vines on the ground. All these had to be cleared out, and a dozen great trees cut down and dragged off to a neighbouring saw-mill, there to be transformed into boards to finish off our house. Then, fetching a great machine, such as might be used to pull a giant's teeth, with ropes, pulleys, oxen, and men, and might and main, we pulled out the stumps, with their great prongs and their network of roots and fibres; and then, alas! we had to begin with all the pretty wild, lovely bushes, and the <b>checkerberries</b> and ferns and wild blackberries and huckleberry- bushes, and dig them up remorselessly, that we might plant our corn and squashes. And so we got a house and a garden right out of the heart of our piece of wild wood, about a mile from the city of H-.|$|R
60|$|A lime-drop boy and {{a little}} pink <b>checkerberry</b> girl were her {{favorite}} playmates; and they had fine times making mud-pies by scraping the chocolate rocks and mixing this dust with honey from the wells near by. These they could eat; and Lily thought this much better than throwing away the pies, as {{she had to do}} at home. They had candy-pulls very often, and made swings of long loops of molasses candy, and bird's-nests with almond eggs, out of which came birds who sang sweetly. They played foot-ball with big bull's-eyes, sailed in sugar boats on lakes of syrup, fished in rivers of molasses, and rode the barley horses all over the country.|$|E
60|$|He {{liked to}} tell the story of that day and night when his friends were recounting adventures by sea and land; but he never said much about the hours on the ledge, always owned that Chris shot the beast, and usually ended by sagely advising his hearers to let their mothers know, when they went off on a lark of that kind. Those who knew and loved him best {{observed}} that he was fonder than ever of nibbling <b>checkerberry</b> leaves, that he didn't mind being laughed at for liking to wear a bit of pine in his buttonhole, and that the skin of the catamount so hardly won lay before his study table till the moths ate it up.|$|E

60|$|But old Mother Magpie had now {{got a new}} {{business}} in hand in another quarter. She bustled off down to Water-Dock Lane, where, as we said in a former narrative, lived the old music-teacher, Dr. Bullfrog. The poor old doctor was a simple-minded, good, amiable creature, who had played the double-bass and led the forest choir on all public occasions since nobody knows when. Latterly some youngsters had arisen who sneered at his performances as behind the age. In fact, since a great city {{had grown up in}} the vicinity of the forest, tribes of wandering boys broke up the simple tastes and quiet habits which old Mother Nature had always kept up in those parts. They pulled the young <b>checkerberry</b> before it even had time to blossom, rooted up the sassafras shrubs and gnawed their roots, fired off guns at the birds, and on several occasions, when old Dr. Bullfrog was leading a concert, had dashed in and broken up the choir by throwing stones.|$|E
60|$|Returning from a short walk, {{he brought}} a vine in his hand, saying that it made the best tea of {{anything}} in the woods. It was the creeping snowberry, which was quite common there, its berries just grown. So we determined to have some tea made of this. It had a slight <b>checkerberry</b> flavor, and we both {{agreed that it was}} really better than the black tea which we had brought. We thought it quite a discovery, and that it might well be dried and sold in the shops. I for one, however, am not an old tea-drinker and cannot speak with authority to others. The Indian said that they also used for tea a certain herb which grew in low ground, which he did not find there, and Labrador tea; also hemlock leaves, the last especially in winter when the other plants were covered with snow; and various other things. We could have had a new kind of tea every night.|$|E
60|$|Here for {{a season}} we leave both our child friends, and when ten years have passed over their heads,--when Moses shall be twenty, and Mara seventeen,--we will return again to tell their story, for {{then there will be}} one to tell. Let us suppose in the interval, how Moses and Mara read Virgil with the minister, and how Mara works a shepherdess with Miss Emily, which astonishes the neighborhood,--but how by herself she learns, after divers trials, to paint partridge, and <b>checkerberry,</b> and {{trailing}} arbutus,--how Moses makes better and better ships, and Sally grows up a handsome girl, and goes up to Brunswick to the high school,--how Captain Kittridge tells stories, and Miss Roxy and Miss Ruey nurse and cut and make and mend for the still rising generation,--how there are quiltings and tea-drinkings and prayer meetings and Sunday sermons,--how Zephaniah and Mary Pennel grow old gradually and graciously, as the sun rises and sets, and the eternal silver tide rises and falls around our little gem, Orr's Island.|$|E
60|$|Spring {{had already}} come, loosing the chains {{of ice in}} all the bays and coves round Harpswell, Orr's Island, Maquoit, and Middle Bay. The {{magnificent}} spruces stood forth in their gala-dresses, tipped on every point with vivid emerald; the silver firs exuded from their tender shoots the fragrance of ripe pineapple; the white pines shot forth long weird fingers {{at the end of}} their fringy boughs; and even every little mimic evergreen in the shadows at their feet was made beautiful by the addition of a vivid border of green on the sombre coloring of its last year's leaves. Arbutus, fragrant with its clean, wholesome odors, gave forth its thousand dewy pink blossoms, and the trailing Linnea borealis hung its pendent twin bells round every mossy stump and old rock damp with green forest mould. The green and vermilion matting of the partridge-berry was impearled with white velvet blossoms, the <b>checkerberry</b> hung forth a translucent bell under its varnished green leaf, and a thousand more fairy bells, white or red, hung on blueberry and huckleberry bushes. The little Pearl of Orr's Island had wandered many an hour gathering bouquets of all these, to fill the brown house with sweetness when her grandfather and Moses should come in from work.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is a {{first-class}} scrape. What a fool I {{was not to}} go back when I could, instead of blundering down here where no one can get at me, and as like as not I can't get out alone! Gun smashed in that confounded fall, so I can't even fire a shot to call help. Nothing to eat or drink, and very likely {{a day or so}} to spend here till I'm found, if I ever am. Chris said, 'Yell, if you want us.' Much good that would do now! I'll try, though." [...] And getting up on his weary legs, Corny shouted till he was hoarse; but echo alone answered him, and after a few efforts he gave it up, trying to accept the situation like a man. As if kind Nature took pity on the poor boy, the little ledge was soft with lichens and thin grass, and here and there grew a sprig of <b>checkerberry,</b> sown by the wind, sheltered by the tree, and nourished by the moisture that trickled down the rock from some hidden spring. Eagerly Corny ate the sweet leaves to stay the pangs of hunger that gnawed him, and finished his meal with grass and pine-needles, calling himself a calf, and wishing his pasture were wider.|$|E
60|$|June and July passed, and {{the lonely}} two lived a quiet {{life in the}} brown house. Everything was so still and fair--no sound but the coming and going tide, and the swaying wind among the pine-trees, and the tick of the clock, and the whirr of the little wheel as Mrs. Pennel sat {{spinning}} in her door in the mild weather. Mara read the Roman history through again, and began it a third time, and read {{over and over again}} the stories and prophecies that pleased her in the Bible, and pondered the wood-cuts and texts in a very old edition of Æsop's Fables; and as she wandered in the woods, picking fragrant bayberries and gathering hemlock, <b>checkerberry,</b> and sassafras to put in the beer which her grandmother brewed, she mused on the things that she read till her little mind became a tabernacle of solemn, quaint, dreamy forms, where old Judean kings and prophets, and Roman senators and warriors, marched in and out in shadowy rounds. She invented long dramas and conversations in which they performed imaginary parts, and it would not have appeared to the child in the least degree surprising either to have met an angel in the woods, or to have formed an intimacy with some talking wolf or bear, such as she read of in Æsop's Fables.|$|E
60|$|Right {{opposite}} our house, on our Mount Clear, {{is an old}} oak, {{the apostle}} of the primeval forest. Once, when this place was all wildwood, {{the man who was}} seeking a spot for the location of the buildings of Phillips Academy climbed this oak, using it as a sort of green watchtower, from whence he might gain a view of the surrounding country. Age and time, since then, have dealt hardly with the stanch old fellow. His limbs have been here and there shattered; his back begins to look mossy and dilapidated; but after all, there is a piquant, decided air about him, that speaks the old age of a tree of distinction, a kingly oak. To-day I see him standing, dimly revealed through the mist of falling snows; to-morrow's sun will show the outline of his gnarled limbs--all rose color with their soft snow burden; and again a few months, and spring will breathe on him, and he will draw a long breath, and break out once more, for the three hundredth time, perhaps, into a vernal crown of leaves. I sometimes think that leaves are the thoughts of trees, and that if we only knew it, we should find their life's experience recorded in them. Our oak! what a crop of meditations and remembrances must he have thrown forth, leafing out century after century. Awhile he spake and thought only of red deer and Indians; of the trillium that opened its white triangle in his shade; of the scented arbutus, fair as the pink ocean shell, weaving her fragrant mats in the moss at his feet; of feathery ferns, casting their silent shadows on the <b>checkerberry</b> leaves, and all those sweet, wild, nameless, half-mossy things, that live in the gloom of forests, and are only desecrated when brought to scientific light, laid out and stretched on a botanic bier. Sweet old forest days!--when blue jay, and yellow hammer, and bobalink made his leaves merry, and summer was a long opera of such music as Mozart dimly dreamed. But then came human kind bustling beneath; wondering, fussing, exploring, measuring, treading down flowers, cutting down trees, scaring bobalinks--and Andover, as men say, began to be settled.|$|E
