40|$|Pericardial adhesions {{that develop}} after primary surgery {{increase}} the risk during cardiac reoperation. Several materials {{have been used as}} pericardial substitutes to facilitate reoperation. In this study, five different materials, equine pericardium, bovine pericardium, porcine pericardium, silicon rubber and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (EPTFE) surgical membrane, were evaluated experimentally to find a suitable pericardial substitute to prevent pericardial adhesions. In 47 dogs, about a 5 cm by 5 cm piece of the pericardium was excised through a right thoracotomy. The <b>cardiac</b> surface was <b>massaged</b> with dry gauze, and the pericardial defect was closed with a patch after the injection of about 1 ml blood into the pericardial sac. Most materials were implanted for more than 12 months, but some subjects were put to death within 12 months due to malnutrition. At autopsy, the development of adhesions and epicardial reaction were graded as none, minimal, moderate and severe. The patches were also examined histologically. The equine pericardium, the bovine pericardium and the porcine pericardium were found to have higher levels of adhesion and epicardial reaction. There were no significant differences among these three materials. One subject from the porcine pericardium group showed calcification of the patch. Signs of organization were found in these materials histologically. It was suggested that xenopericardiums were not suitable for prevention of pericardial adhesions. The silicon rubber had significantly lower levels of adhesion compared with the equine pericardium, the porcine pericardium and the EPTFE membrane. However this material had the most significant epicardial reaction. So it was considered that silicon rubber was not acceptable in such cases as aortocoronary bypass resurgery. The EPTFE surgical membrane had no superiority for adhesion or epicardial reaction, but it seemed to be useful because no sign of organization was found in this material histologically. We need to continue to look for the ideal substitute which develops no pericardial adhesions and has no epicardial reaction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction: Massage can {{be defined}} as the rhythmic and smooth {{manipulation}} of body tissues, with the aim to promote health and well-being. Objective: To assess the influence of classic <b>massage</b> on <b>cardiac</b> autonomic modulation. Methods: Cross-sectional study that evaluated healthy participants, with mean age between 18 and 25 years, divided into two groups: test group (TG, n= 11) and control group (CG, n= 10). The TG had their heartbeat recorded for 5 min before receiving a classic massage for 40 min and during three periods after this procedure: 0 - 5 min, 5 - 10 min and 10 - 15 min. The CG had their heartbeats recorded at the same time; without receive <b>massage.</b> <b>Cardiac</b> autonomic modulation was investigated by heart rate variability (HRV). Results: The mean values of HRV rates were: pNN 50, respectively, for the TG: before massage (10. 5 ± 9. 5 %), and after massage: 0 - 5 min (11. 6 ± 7. 2 %), 5 - 10 min (12. 1 ± 8. 0 %) and 10 - 15 min (11. 1 ± 7. 9 %), with no significant statistical difference. The same result was found for the mean values of rMSSD index of the TG; before massage: 52. 1 ± 46. 2 ms, and after massage: 0 - 5 min (50. 0 ± 21. 6 ms), 5 - 10 min (52. 0 ± 27. 4 ms) and 10 - 15 min (48. 2 ± 21. 1 ms). Also, the values of LFnuand HFnu indexes did not change significantly before and after massage, and they were not statistically different from the values presented by the control group. Conclusion: The study results suggest that one session of classic massage does not modify cardiac autonomic modulation in healthy young adults...|$|R

25|$|In {{the winter}} 2000 {{transfer}} window, South African striker Sibusiso Zuma was signed from South African side Orlando Pirates, and in May 2000, English manager Roy Hodgson became the new manager. From the 2000–01 season, the club started to improve. The club won its second Superliga championship, winning 3–1 {{in the last}} New Firm derby match of the season, at the Parken Stadium. The 2–0 goal was a bicycle kick by Zuma, who received the ball at his chest, bounced {{it in the air}} and in the same motion executed the overhead kick, volleying the ball into the far corner out of Brøndby goalkeeper Mogens Krogh's reach. This was later voted the Danish goal of the year, and was voted the best Superliga goal of the decade in December 2009 and was in 2013 voted as the greatest moment in the history of FCK. Roy Hodgson broke his contract with Copenhagen a few weeks after having won the championship, signing with Italian team Udinese, and he was replaced by Swede Kent Karlsson. The 2001 season is also remembered for a highly dramatic event. During training on 13 March 2001 charismatic midfielder Ståle Solbakken suffered a heart attack. He was rapidly attended to by club doctor Frank Odgaard who found that his heart had stopped beating and started to administer <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage.</b> Upon the ambulance's arrival, Solbakken was pronounced clinically dead at the scene, but {{on the way to the}} hospital in the ambulance he was revived nearly seven minutes later. He survived the episode and had a pacemaker fitted. Shortly after, on medical advice, he announced his playing retirement, but would later return to the club and become its most successful manager.|$|E

50|$|Basic aseptic measures, such as pouring {{antiseptic}} solution over the woman's abdomen prior to incision, {{may be considered}} {{as long as this}} adds no delay.

Either a classical midine incision or a Pfannenstiel incision may be used depending on operator preference; the former may theoretically give better exposure, but practising obstetricians or surgeons may be more comfortable with a Pfannenstiel approach as this is more commonly used for Caesarean sections. Once the uterus is opened, the fetus is delivered and should be resuscitated by a separate team.

5000|$|The {{external}} defibrillator as {{known today}} {{was invented by}} Electrical Engineer William Kouwenhoven in 1930.

He invented the defibrillator and tested on a dog, like Prévost and Batelli.The first use on a human was in 1947 by Claude Beck, professor of surgery at Case Western Reserve University. Beck's theory was that ventricular fibrillation often occurred in hearts which were fundamentally healthy, in his terms [...] "Hearts that are too good to die", and that there must be a way of saving them. Beck first used the technique successfully on a 14-year-old boy who was being operated on for a congenital chest defect. The boy's chest was surgically opened, and manual <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> was undertaken for 45 minutes until the arrival of the defibrillator. Beck used internal paddles {{on either side of the}} heart, along with procainamide, an antiarrhythmic drug, and achieved return of normal sinus rhythm.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: <b>Cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> is {{the first}} and most {{important}} step during Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). Effective massage restores blood flow to the brain and heart and plays a remarkable role in a successful CPR. Exhaustion of treatment team during resuscitation is one of the factors which may lead to reduced quality of resuscitation massages or failure in some cases. The aim {{of this study was to}} design, construct and evaluate a new <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> facilitator to improve the quality of CPR in adult patients. Methods: In this study, the massage facilitator was designed and registered as a glove which was worn by rescuers during <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> (number of invention: 80797). A load cell sensor was placed under the surface of the glove and the facilitator could be displayed number and depth of massage in centimeters. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the designed system, an experimental study was conducted among 30 emergency students. All statistical analyses were performed by SPSS 19 software using Pearson correlation and independent sample t-test. P-values lower than   0. 05 were considered to be significant. Results: The mean age of all participants was 23. 41 ± 2. 02 years, the mean height was 175 ± 4. 43 centimeters and the mean weight was 65. 45 ± 5. 02 kilograms. The instrument validity was evaluated using standard validation method of concurrent validity. Our findings revealed a significant correlation between the <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> facilitator and Sim Pad system (more than 0. 9). Accordingly, the validity of <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> facilitator was confirmed. While assessing the efficient massage criteria during <b>cardiac</b> <b>massage</b> facilitator utilization, the massage possessed suitable depth (less than 5 cm) in 98 % of participants.
