5|$|Despite his {{previous}} actions of breaking into ISIS and hacking the mainframe, Archer is excused from his expenses after Cyril {{comes to the}} assumption that Kremenski had been stealing from Archer's account the whole time. Malory notes {{that she would have}} known if there was a mole at ISIS, her earlier phone call shown to have been with Nikolai Jakov, head of the KGB.

5|$|After sending Stewie out {{for more}} paper, Paul finds several news {{articles}} in an album that imply Wilkes is actually a serial killer. Just then, the local sheriff (Joe) appears, and is surprised to find Paul there. Before he can help him, however, Stewie blows his legs off with a shotgun. The sheriff then <b>complains</b> <b>that</b> he will now {{have to spend the}} rest of his life in a wheelchair, only to be shot again and killed by Stewie. Paul finally finishes the book and demands Stewie let him go, but Stewie refuses, knowing he could try to turn him/her in to the police and tell them s/he kidnapped him, held him hostage, and fondled him in his sleep, which Paul did not know originally. Paul's ultimate fate is left ambiguous as the story ends with a Magnum, P.I.-style credits roll.|$|E
5|$|At the party, the {{employees}} vent their hatred of Nellie onto Pam to avoid admitting the truth, making Pam uncomfortable. The magician that was hired (Brett Gelman) arrives, much to Nellie's dismay. Jim, Dwight, and Pam, out of solidarity to Nellie, sabotage the magician's tricks until he reaches breaking point and Dwight kicks him out. Nellie and Robert commend {{the employees}} for throwing a good party, but Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) <b>complains</b> <b>that</b> the carrot cake has actual vegetables in it, which Pam {{made as a}} prank. When Jim and Pam leave for the day, Pam asks Hank Tate (Hugh Dane) why he let the magician into the elevator {{when he was asked}} not to. Hank, busy reading a magazine, claims not to have noticed him, stating that as a magician he could have slipped by.|$|E
50|$|Copts <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> {{disputes}} between Christians and Muslims are often put before “reconciliation councils”, {{and that these}} councils invariably favour Muslims. Some Copts <b>complain</b> <b>that</b> the police do not respond when crimes are committed against them. Copts also have little representation in government, leading them to fear there is little hope of progress.|$|R
50|$|Though he {{remained}} {{a supporter of}} TVA, Neal constantly criticized the agency throughout the 1930s. He <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> its wages were too low, accused it of favoritism toward large industries, and <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> it was too slow in buying out independent power companies. After TVA had bought out most independent power companies, Neal <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> {{the loss of the}} companies hurt Tennessee counties which had relied on their tax dollars. When TVA forced Neal to sell his Rhea Springs property during the Watts Bar project (when the entire community was inundated), Neal sued, and was eventually paid $55,000 for the land.|$|R

5|$|Some of Garrison's staff {{begin to}} doubt his motives and {{disagree}} with his methods, {{and leave the}} investigation. Garrison's marriage is strained when his wife Liz (Sissy Spacek) <b>complains</b> <b>that</b> he is spending {{more time on the}} case than with his own family. After a sinister phone call is made to their daughter, Liz accuses Garrison of being selfish and attacking Shaw only because of his homosexuality. In addition, the media launches attacks on television and in newspapers attacking Garrison's character and criticizing the way his office is spending taxpayers' money. Some key witnesses become scared and refuse to testify while others, such as Ferrie, are killed in suspicious circumstances. Before his death, Ferrie tells Garrison that he believes people are after him, and reveals there was a conspiracy around Kennedy's death.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Andy grows {{determined}} {{to escape from}} Shawshank, and informs Red {{that he is going}} to Zihuatanejo in Mexico, telling him that if he should ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, and there will be a volcanic rock, and a gift for him under it. During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a hole through Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends, allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a parole board and <b>complains</b> <b>that</b> the concept of rehabilitation is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no apparent reason, Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in Zihuatanejo, eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.|$|E

Nick {{falls in love}} with Sharon, despite Sharon's ex-boyfriend Matt Clark's (Eddie Cibrian) attempts to win her back.

Nick and Sharon become engaged; she tells him about the rape, which leads him to avenge Matt. Matt is shot, and Nick is the chief suspect. He is convicted and acquitted several months later, when Amy confesses to the shooting. After Matt leaves town, Nick and Sharon marry; to hold on to Nick, Sharon stops using birth control and becomes pregnant. Nick <b>complains</b> <b>that</b> he is unready for fatherhood; Sharon nearly has an abortion, but he stops her. In 1997, she gives birth to Noah Newman, who nearly dies after his premature birth. While Noah was critically ill Sharon's best friend (Grace Turner) tracks down the child Sharon gave birth to as a teenager (Cassie) and brings her to Genoa City, believing Cassie was lessen the pain if Noah died.

5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he said {{at the start of the}} episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily <b>complains</b> <b>that</b> bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E

25|$|Alison Cook, {{writing in}} the Houston Chronicle, argues the case of bacon's American {{citizenship}} by referring to historical and geographical uses of bacon.

25|$|Staring {{at others}} is {{generally}} discouraged by most nudist and naturist groups, and {{could result in}} eviction if someone <b>complains</b> <b>that</b> it made them uncomfortable.

On the other hand, staring has been acceptable at the largely abandoned female beauty contests (see below).|$|E
