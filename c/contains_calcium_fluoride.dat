40|$|The {{production}} of ceramic tiles {{results in the}} expulsion of many wastes. One of the waste substances which could be eliminated from the tile-making process is the exhausted lime which <b>contains</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride</b> as the main component. The maximum amount of exhausted lime which can be recycled without modifying {{the properties of the}} tiles is determined. The effects of the calcium fluoride on the microstructure of the tiles is investigated. It is discovered that addition of CaF 2 greater than 0. 5 - 1. 0 wt% results in a strongly modified microstructure. Anorthite is produced at the expense of mullite leading to swelling of the tiles at the industrial firing temperatures...|$|E
5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride,</b> cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes <b>containing</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride</b> (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|R

2500|$|Fluoride {{was first}} added to toothpastes in the 1890s. Tanagra, <b>containing</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride</b> as the active ingredient, was sold by Karl F.

Fluoride toothpastes developed in the 1950s received the ADA's approval. To develop the first ADA-approved fluoride toothpaste, Procter & Gamble started a research program in the early 1940s. In 1950, Procter & Gamble developed a joint research project team headed by Dr. Joseph Muhler at Indiana University to study new toothpaste with fluoride. In 1955, Procter & Gamble's Crest launched its first clinically proven fluoride-containing toothpaste.

25|$|Tin(II) fluoride, {{commonly}} referred to commercially as stannous fluoride (from Latin , 'tin') is a chemical compound with the formula SnF2. It is a colorless solid used as an ingredient in toothpastes that are typically more expensive than those that use sodium fluoride. Stannous <b>fluoride</b> converts the <b>calcium</b> mineral apatite into fluorapatite, which makes tooth enamel more resistant to bacteria-generated acid attacks. In toothpastes <b>containing</b> <b>calcium</b> minerals, sodium <b>fluoride</b> becomes ineffective over time, while stannous fluoride remains effective in strengthening tooth enamel. Stannous fluoride {{has been shown to}} be more effective than sodium fluoride in reducing the incidence of dental caries and controlling gingivitis.|$|R

During 14 days, enamel surfaces were daily exposed to a 6 -h bleaching regimen followed by storage in artificial saliva. Surface microhardness was measured before (baseline), during (7 th day), immediately after bleaching (14 th day) and 1 week post bleaching. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (p< 0. 05). All treatments reduced SM significantly during the bleaching cycle (7 th day), immediately after bleaching (14 th day) and 1 week post bleaching, compared to baseline and to the unbleached control group.

40|$|Metal {{hydroxide}} sludge is a metallurgical residue from neutralisation of spent pickling baths in {{stainless steel}} plants. Metal hydroxide sludge mainly <b>contains</b> metal hydroxides, <b>calcium,</b> <b>fluoride</b> {{and water and}} has up until now been deposited in landfills in Sweden. This thesis shows that hydroxide sludge is fully possible to recycle back into the AOD converter during slag reduction stage. Its <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride</b> contents are utilized as flux. Prior to reintroduction, the hydroxide sludge is dried and calcined to drive off all water, included chemically bonded water. Calcined metal hydroxide sludge is called hydroflux. Metal content in hydroflux is present as metal oxides. In a bench-scale AOD converter seven successful reduction tests, with three different varieties of hydrofluxes, type A, B and C were performed. The reduction tests are conducted with same basicity and CaO/CaF 2 ratio as a full scale AOD converter. Chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction analysis show that near identical final slag chemistry is achieved as planned. Some differences in metal retrieval, depending on hydroflux type used, are noticed. Briquetting as agglomeration method is performed on one hydroflux. Three types of strength tests are performed on the hydrofluxes and results are compared to toughness of mineral fluorspar. Theoretical calculation results show how final slag as well as additives will increase with use of hydroflux as <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride</b> provider in the AOD converter during reduction procedure. The pros and cons for every hydroflux are weighed against each other and one type of hydroflux is recommended for further full-scale usage. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

5000|$|In the laboratory, <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride</b> is {{commonly}} used as a window material for both infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths, since it is transparent in these regions (about 0.15 µm to 9 µm) and exhibits extremely low change in refractive index with wavelength. Furthermore, the material is attacked by few reagents. At wavelengths as short as 157 nm, a common wavelength used for semiconductor stepper manufacture for integrated circuit lithography, the refractive index of <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride</b> shows some non-linearity at high power densities, which has inhibited its use for this purpose. In {{the early years of}} the 21st century, the stepper market for <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride</b> collapsed, and many large manufacturing facilities have been closed.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the temperature changes in dry sliding contact for braking applications. An original metrology method was developed using a special pad with a <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride</b> 'window' in its centre. As <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride</b> is transparent to infrared radiation (up to 92 % in 1 - 5 μm spectra), it allows access to the disc surface during friction for estimating its temperature using a two-colour pyrometer. Using this set-up, the surface temperature of the disc was successfully determined during friction. In addition, the temperature in the contact area was compared to that measured immediately outside the contact area; the difference between them proved to be very minimal (< 5 %). The effect of introducing a <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride</b> 'window' on friction was also studied, and the results show that its use does not affect the friction coefficient.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a possible}} new {{concept of the}} role of fluoride and its mechanism of action in caries prevention. In the past fluoride inhibition of caries was ascribed to reduced solubility due to incorporation of fluoride (F–) into the enamel minerals (firmly bound fluoride or fluorapatite). Based on the new findings, it appears that fluoride, either released into or present in the fluid phase bathing the hard tissue, is more important for the reduction of caries development and progression. There is convincing evidence that fluoride has a major effect on demineralization and remineralization of dental hard tissue and that it interferes with acid production from cariogenic bacteria. The provision of dissolved fluoride is the key to successful therapy. The source of this fluoride could either be fluorapatite or <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride</b> (CaF 2) (like) precipitates, which are formed on the enamel and in the plaque after application of topical fluoride. The precipitates of <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride</b> do not dissolve quickly as was initially believed. <b>Calcium</b> <b>fluoride</b> coating at neutral pH by pellicle proteins and phosphate is the main reason for this. The dissolution of the <b>fluoride</b> from <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride</b> is pH dependent. At lower pH, the coating is lost and an increased dissolution rate of <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride</b> occurs. The CaF 2, therefore, act as an efficient source of free fluoride ions during the cariogenic challenge. These are subsequently incorporated into the enamel as hydroxyfluorapatite or fluorapatite...|$|R
