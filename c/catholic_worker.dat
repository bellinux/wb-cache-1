25|$|The <b>Catholic</b> <b>Worker</b> {{movement}} {{began as}} a means to combine Dorothy Day's history in American social activism, anarchism, and pacifism with the tenets of Catholicism (including a strong current of distributism), five years after her 1927 conversion.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s Schmitt {{caught the}} {{attention}} of Catholic social activist Peter Maurin, founder of the <b>Catholic</b> <b>Worker</b> newspaper, which published a series of articles about him in late 1934. <b>Catholic</b> <b>Worker</b> contributing writer Donald Powell recalls the first time he met Schmitt: “Several of us had gathered to discuss social justice. I remember his stating that social justice could be obtained only by starting with the individual; that is, when the individual was just, society was just, and that the Catholic could do the most by example. Which means, in effect, that Catholics must be converted to Catholicism before attempting to convert non-Catholics to it.” Maurin himself wrote an essay about Schmitt for the newspaper, later reprinted in his book Catholic Radicalism.|$|E

25|$|The People's Café, a house trailer {{configured}} {{and decorated}} as a café, was mysteriously installed in People's Park overnight in 1988, {{with no one}} claiming responsibility. Volunteers from the <b>Catholic</b> <b>Worker</b> Movement and elsewhere began serving food from it the next day, distributing approximately 100 breakfasts per day. It lasted a few months, until the university removed the trailer early one morning after an inspection by the Berkeley Health Department.|$|E
25|$|Gruesome {{images of}} two anti-war activists who set {{themselves}} on fire in November 1965 provided iconic images of how strongly some people {{felt that the}} war was immoral. On November 2, 32-year-old Quaker Norman Morrison set himself on fire in front of The Pentagon. On November 9, 22-year-old <b>Catholic</b> <b>Worker</b> Movement member Roger Allen LaPorte did the same in front of United Nations Headquarters in New York City. Both protests were conscious imitations of earlier (and ongoing) Buddhist protests in South Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Her first novel, Castle Rackrent (1800) {{was written}} and {{submitted}} for anonymous publication in 1800 without her father's knowledge. It {{was an immediate}} success and firmly established Edgeworth's appeal. The book is a satire on Anglo-Irish landlords, before the year 1782, showing {{the need for more}} responsible management by the Irish landowning class. The story follows four generations of an Irish landholding family, the Rackrents. It is narrated by an Irish <b>catholic</b> <b>worker</b> on the estate, named Thady Quirk, and portrayed the rise of the catholic-Irish middle class.|$|E

25|$|In 1860, the Bard {{family had}} {{provided}} money {{so that a}} small Episcopal seminary near their Tivoli estate could be expanded into St. Stephen's College, later renamed after them. It eventually expanded into three of the former country seats. This {{was the beginning of}} a second life for some of the old country seats, as some moved out of private residential use and became institutions. The Catholic Church received Ellerslie, Ferncliff and Linwood, using them for various purposes. Dorothy Day made Rose Hill the location of one the <b>Catholic</b> <b>Worker</b> Movement's farms during the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Catholic</b> <b>Worker</b> Movement is {{concerned}} with both social justice and pacifist issues, and voiced consistent opposition to the Spanish Civil War and World War II. Many of its early members were imprisoned for their opposition to conscription. Within the Roman Catholic Church, the Pax Christi organisation is the premiere pacifist lobby group. It holds positions similar to APF, and the two organisations are known {{to work together on}} ecumenical projects. Within Roman Catholicism there has been a discernible move towards a more pacifist position through the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Popes Benedict XV, John XXIII and John Paul II were all vocal in their opposition to specific wars. By taking the name Benedict XVI, some suspected that Joseph Ratzinger would continue the strong emphasis upon nonviolent conflict resolution of his predecessor. However, the Roman Catholic Church officially maintains the legitimacy of Just War, which is rejected by some pacifists.|$|E
500|$|Many of Auden's poems {{during the}} 1930s and after were {{inspired}} by unconsummated love, and in the 1950s he summarised his emotional life in a famous couplet: [...] "If equal affection cannot be / Let the more loving one be me" [...] ("The More Loving One"). He had a gift for friendship and, starting in the late 1930s, a strong wish for the stability of marriage; {{in a letter to}} his friend James Stern he called marriage [...] "the only subject." [...] Throughout his life, Auden performed charitable acts, sometimes in public (as in his 1935 marriage of convenience to Erika Mann that provided her with a British passport to escape the Nazis), but, especially in later years, more often in private. He was embarrassed if they were publicly revealed, as when his gift to his friend Dorothy Day for the <b>Catholic</b> <b>Worker</b> movement was reported on the front page of The New York Times in 1956.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the modern}} street {{newspaper}} {{began with the}} 1989 publication of Street News in New York City, and the Street Sheet in San Francisco, 1989, newspapers sold by the poor and homeless to generate income and to bring attention to social problems {{date back to the}} late 19th century; journalism scholar Norma Fay Green has cited The War Cry, created by the Salvation Army in London in 1879, as an early form of [...] "dissident, underground, alternative publication". The War Cry was sold by Salvation Army officers and the working poor to draw people's attention to the poor living conditions of these individuals. Another precursor to the modern street newspaper was Cincinnati's Hobo News, which ran from 1915 to 1930 and featured writing from prominent labor and social activists as well as Industrial Workers of the World members, alongside contributions of oral history, creative writing, and artwork from hoboes, or itinerant beggars. Most street papers published before 1970, such as The <b>Catholic</b> <b>Worker</b> (founded in 1933), were affiliated with religious organizations. Like workers' papers and other forms of alternative media in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, early street newspapers were often created because the founders believed mainstream news did not cover issues that were relevant to ordinary people.|$|E

2500|$|His {{record for}} the next 33 fights fell to 11–20–2. With his family in poverty during the Great Depression, Braddock {{had to give up}} boxing for a little while and worked as a longshoreman. [...] Due to {{frequent}} injuries to his right hand, Braddock compensated by using his left hand during his longshoreman work, and it gradually became stronger than his right. He always remembered the humiliation of having to accept government relief money, but was inspired by the <b>Catholic</b> <b>Worker</b> Movement, a Christian social justice organization founded by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin in 1933 to help the homeless and hungry. After his boxing comeback, Braddock returned the welfare money he had received and made frequent donations to various <b>Catholic</b> <b>Worker</b> Houses, including feeding homeless guests with his family.|$|E
2500|$|Historian John McGreevey notes, [...] "Priests {{across the}} country in the 1930s {{encouraged}} their parishioners to join unions, and some like Pittsburgh's Monsignor Charles Rice, Detroit's Frederick Siedenberg, and Buffalo's Monsignor John P.Boland, served on regional labor boards and played key roles in workplace negotiations." [...] The <b>Catholic</b> <b>Worker</b> Movement and Dorothy Day grew out of the same impetuses to put Catholic social teaching into action.|$|E
2500|$|The Committee of Catholics to Fight Anti-Semitism (later {{known as}} the Committee of Catholics for Human Rights) was an American Catholic anti-racist {{organization}} formed in May 1939, partially {{in response to the}} 1938 announcement of Pope Pius XI that [...] "it is not possible for Christians to take part in anti-Semitism". [...] It was supported by many prominent Catholics, including members of the <b>Catholic</b> <b>Worker</b> Movement, among them Dorothy Day.|$|E

2500|$|There were {{conscientious}} objectors and war tax resisters in both World War I and World War II. [...] The United States government allowed sincere objectors {{to serve}} in noncombatant military roles. However, those draft resisters who refused any cooperation with the war effort often spent much of each war in federal prisons. During World War II, pacifist leaders like Dorothy Day and Ammon Hennacy of the <b>Catholic</b> <b>Worker</b> Movement urged young Americans not to enlist in military service.|$|E
2500|$|The group {{started with}} the <b>Catholic</b> <b>Worker</b> newspaper, created to promote Catholic social {{teaching}} and stake out a neutral, pacifist position in the war-torn 1930s. This grew into a [...] "house of hospitality" [...] in the slums of New York City and then a series of farms for people to live together communally. The movement quickly spread to other cities in the United States, and to Canada and the United Kingdom; more than 30 independent but affiliated CW communities had been founded by 1941. Well over 100 communities exist today, including several in Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, and Sweden.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1938 Pope Pius XI, {{speaking}} {{to a group of}} Belgian pilgrims, denounced anti-Semitism explicitly, saying that it was incompatible with Christianity. [...] Influenced by this statement, a group of American bishops released a statement encouraging Catholics to, [...] "guard against all forms of racial bigotry." [...] Inspired by the statement of the bishops, the Committee of Catholics to Fight Anti-Semitism was formed in May 1939 by Dorothy Day, Catherine Doherty, other supporters of the <b>Catholic</b> <b>Worker</b> Movement, and Emmanuel Chapman, professor at Fordham University, who was its first executive secretary. [...] Also included among the founders were artists, philosophers, writers and, according to Day, [...] "a long list of priests and nuns." [...] In August 1939 the group changed its name to the Committee of Catholics for Human Rights.|$|E
5000|$|The Morrison {{self-immolation}} at the Pentagon was {{front-page news}} as <b>Catholic</b> <b>Workers</b> gathered for an antiwar demonstration on Union Square in New York City on November 6, 1965, which LaPorte attended shortly after joining the Christian-anarchist sect. Dorothy Day, {{the leader of}} the <b>Catholic</b> <b>Workers,</b> addressed the crowd. [...] "I speak today as one who is old, and who must endorse the courage of the young who themselves are willing to give up their freedom," [...] Day said. [...] "This very struggle was begun by courage, even in martyrdom, which has been shared by the little children, in the struggle for full freedom and human dignity." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{writer in}} the National Catholic Review wrote that while the <b>Catholic</b> <b>Workers</b> had been {{important}} to the Church, they displayed [...] "a sort of built-in rejection of complexity that I hope was not operative in LaPorte's death." ...|$|R
