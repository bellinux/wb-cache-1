50|$|After {{attending}} a Valentino birthday celebration at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in 2002, Wyatt approached the owners through {{a friend who}} worked there and arranged a screening of Alfred Hitchcock’s Strangers on a Train on July 20, 2002 using two 35mm projectors with a <b>changeover</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{on the back of}} a pickup truck. Eighty people showed up for the initial screening, and a follow-up screening of Sam Fuller’s Pickup on South Street brought out an audience of a thousand. They showed four films the first season, favoring mid-century classics that might be rediscovered by a younger audience, and roughly 25 films every summer thereafter.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{mechanisms}} driving changes in social values, or those values emphasizing relationships, intimate bonds, and families, {{in the new}} market economies of Russia, China, and Eastern Germany. It is hypothesized that tensions between social values and individualism, materialism, and calculative rationality have arisen {{as a result of}} the transformation to a free-market economy. Methods used are both contrasted semi-structured qualitative interviews with new-rich businessmen and their fathers in Moscow, Shanghai, and Leipzig and the secondary quantitative analysis of World Values Survey data. Findings illustrate the roles of cognitive adaptation, cognitive dissonance, ideological conflict, and intergenerational <b>changeover</b> as <b>mechanisms</b> through which individuals values tend toward de-intimization as a latent effect of their adoption of the following 'tools of success' critical to the core of capitalist market culture: profit calculation, commodified time, instrumentalization of relationships, image cultivation, personal ambition and independence, enhanced work focus, tolerance of failure, and moral flexibility...|$|R
40|$|Single pellet {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} out in a nitrogen atmosphere to study the reduction of hematite by graphite in the temperature range 925 to 1060 °C. The effect of variables such as c/Fe 2 O 3 molar ratio, pellet size, and so forth, has been investigated. Gas analysis data show a continuous decrease in CO 2 /CO ratio during reduction, the values being far away from Fe/FeO equilibrium for wustite reduction by CO. The activation energies associated with different degrees of reduction appear to be widely different suggesting a possible <b>changeover</b> in reaction <b>mechanism</b> during the progress of reduction. X-ray diffraction studies confirm the stepwise nature of hematite reduction...|$|R
40|$|Dissolution as a {{function}} of solution undersaturation (Ω) was studied on both celestite and barite (001) by the aid of atomic force microscopy (AFM). Both the sulfates exhibited non-linear reactivity trends showing increasing dissolution rates with decreasing Ω. In the case of celestite, the dissolution rate non linearity was attributed to a <b>changeover</b> in reaction <b>mechanism.</b> At higher undersaturations below a critical saturation state of Ωcrit 0. 1, dissolution occurred both along the existing step edges and also via the creation of new steps. At conditions near saturation states dissolution took place exclusively by removal of ions from existing step edges. On the other hand dissolution rate nonlinearity in the case of barite was controlled by changes in step speeds with Ω. Similar dissolution rate behavior also evident on powdered barite in mixed flow reactor system establishes the dissolution rate non-linearity in terms Ω to be the characteristic property of barite. Celestite (001) dissolution was also studied in terms of Sr:SO 4 by AFM to examine the mineral 2 ̆ 7 s reactivity under nonstoichiometric solute conditions. At Ω = 0. 63, reaction kinetics were investigated by measuring 3 ̆c 0103 ̆e and 3 ̆c 1203 ̆e step speeds. Application of a theoretical model, describing step speed as {{a function}} of Sr:SO 4 indicated that both step speeds reached maxima at Sr:SO 4 = 1. This implied that the rate of SO 42 - ion attachment was equal to that of the Sr 2 + ion to the kink sites. Laboratory experiments on barite dissolution in the presence of CrO 42 -(aq) exhibited substantial lowering in dissolution rates due to adsorption of CrO 42 - onto surface reactive sites. AFM studies on barite (001) at 70 °C showed dissolution rates 2. 3 times lower at 1000 μM CrO 42 - and MFR experiments on powdered barite at 25 °C quantified 2 times lowering in dissolution rates at 5 μM CrO 42 -. Transport of aqueous CrO 42 - (4 mM) through powdered barite in one dimensional plug flow reactor showed delayed chromate peak arrival times compared to that of a tracer (Na+) at all flow rates. The efficiency of barite being able to retain aqueous chromate appears to be a possible means to clean chromate contaminated waste waters...|$|R
