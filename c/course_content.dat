40|$|The paper {{reports a}} {{classroom}} action research that aimed {{to determine the}} impact of a Content and Language Integrated Learning on the mastery of vocabulary and of <b>course</b> <b>contents</b> of a group of students in the Accounting Department of Universitas Ma Chung. It also intended to identify their opinions about the effectiveness of such approach. To achieve these objectives, a Time Series Design was used in a Classroom Action Research framework to introduce an adjunct class to the accounting class. The baseline data in the form of their vocabulary mastery and knowledge of the <b>course</b> <b>contents</b> were gained before the adjunct session was given. Then, the adjunct sessions were given for a period of two months. A few tests were administered to measure their progress in the mastery of vocabulary and <b>course</b> <b>contents.</b> A comparison was then drawn between the scores of the baseline data and the subsequent measures. In general, although they gained better mastery of new words, they failed to utilize them to increase their mastery of the <b>course</b> <b>contents.</b> Further exploration into the interview data reveals that most of them did not feel any significant assistance in mastering the <b>course</b> <b>contents,</b> although many of them admitted the benefit of mastering new vocabulary. There are some possible causes of the results. First, the limited duration of the adjunct sessions was felt to hinder the effectiveness. Second, the explanation in the adjunct sessions were not matched quite well with the focus during the main <b>content</b> <b>course.</b> On the basis of the results, the recommended points are the matching between the emphasis of both classes, and the lengthening of the duration of the adjunct sessions...|$|R

This new version, re-titled Wood Badge for the 21st Century, was initially revised to include principles of Situational Leadership. However, the Center for Leadership Studies, which owns the trademark for Situational Leadership, required the Boy Scouts to pay royalties for each Scouter attending Wood Badge nationwide. The Wood Badge Task Force decided to describe how groups change and evolve using more generic, non-trademarked language free of royalties. The program emphasized the stages of team development based on the principles described by Bruce Tuckman in 1965 as forming-storming-norming-performing.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, {{inspired}} by the open source and open access movements, MIT launched OpenCourseWare to make the lecture notes, problem sets, syllabuses, exams, and lectures from {{the great majority of}} its courses available online for no charge, though without any formal accreditation for coursework completed. While the cost of supporting and hosting the project is high, OCW expanded in 2005 to include other universities {{as a part of the}} OpenCourseWare Consortium, which currently includes more than 250 academic institutions with content available in at least six languages. In 2011, MIT announced it would offer formal certification (but not credits or degrees) to online participants completing coursework in its [...] "MITx" [...] program, for a modest fee. The [...] "edX" [...] online platform supporting MITx was initially developed in partnership with Harvard and its analogous [...] "Harvardx" [...] initiative.

500|$|An {{alternative}} educational approach {{informed by}} cognitive flexibility is hypertext, which is frequently computer-supported instruction. Computers allow for complex {{data to be}} presented in a multidimensional and coherent format, allowing users to access that data as needed. The most widely used example of hypertext is the Internet, which dynamically presents information in terms of interconnection (e.g. hyperlinks). Hypertext documents, therefore, include nodes – bits of information – and links, the pathways between these nodes. Applications for teacher education have involved teacher-training sessions based on video instruction, whereby novice teachers viewed footage of master teachers conducting a literacy workshop. [...] In this example, the novice teachers received a laserdisc of the <b>course</b> <b>content,</b> a hypertext document that allowed the learners to access content in a self-directed manner. These [...] (CFH) provide a “three-dimensional” and “open-ended” representation of material for learners, enabling them to incorporate new information and form connections with preexisting knowledge. While {{further research is needed}} to determine the efficacy of CFH as an instructional tool, classrooms where cognitive flexibility theory is applied in this manner are hypothesized to result in students more capable of transferring knowledge across domains.|$|E

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study examines the current <b>course</b> <b>contents</b> of international marketing (IM) courses {{in higher education}} institutions. Using Leximancer, a qualitative research tool for text-mining and lexicographic analysis, we conducted a content analysis of 290 <b>course</b> <b>contents</b> of U. S. and Australian business schools accredited by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Not surprisingly, concept mapping reveals broad diversity among the topics covered in IM, most notably related to macro-environmental influences such as culture, the international environment and fundamental aspects related to marketing strategy. Our findings suggest that topics related to international services and thus, the global services sector do not receive the individualized attention that one would expect in today’s rapidly changing marketplace, where growth in the demand for services is unprecedented. The findings indicate {{that the majority of}} <b>course</b> <b>contents</b> are structured around global macro-environmental forces and the traditional goods-centered marketing mix framework as opposed to micro-environmental forces, such as consumption patterns and buying behavior of consumers, and meso-environmental forces, which include standard operating procedures, rules and guidelines. We provide a discussion to inform and stimulate the future development of IM curricula...|$|R

Being a piece of {{domestic}} architecture, the chief object in its exterior design will be to arouse domestic feelings, which, as we saw before, it will do most distinctly by corresponding with {{the first part of}} character. Yet it is still more necessary that it should correspond with its situation; and hence arises another difficulty, the reconciliation of correspondence with contraries; for such, it is deeply to be regretted, are too often the individual's mind, and the dwelling-place it chooses. The polished courtier brings his refinement and duplicity with him to ape the Arcadian rustic in Devonshire; the romantic rhymer takes a plastered habitation, with one back window looking into the Green Park; the soft votary of luxury endeavors to rise at seven, in some Ultima Thule of frosts and storms; and the rich stock-jobber calculates his percentages among the soft dingles and woody shores of Westmoreland.
