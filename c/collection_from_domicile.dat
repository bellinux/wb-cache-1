40|$|Fluctuating {{asymmetry}} (FA), {{a slight}} and random departure from bilateral symmetry that is normally distributed around a 0 mean, {{has been widely}} used to infer developmental instability. We investigated whether habitats (ecotopes) and host-feeding sources influenced wing FA of the hematophagous bug Triatoma infestans. Because bug populations occupying distinct habitats differed substantially and consistently in various aspects such as feeding rates, engorgement status {{and the proportion of}} gravid females, we predicted that bugs from more open peridomestic habitats (i. e., goat corrals) were more likely to exhibit higher FA than bugs <b>from</b> <b>domiciles.</b> We examined patterns of asymmetry and the amount of wing size and shape FA in 196 adult T. infestans collected across a gradient of habitat suitability and stability that decreased <b>from</b> <b>domiciles,</b> storerooms, kitchens, chicken coops, pig corrals, to goat corrals in a well-defined area of Figueroa, northwestern Argentina. The bugs had unmixed blood meals on human, chicken, pig and goat depending on the bug collection ecotope. We documented the occurrence of FA in wing shape for bugs fed on all host-feeding sources and in all ecotopes except for females <b>from</b> <b>domiciles</b> or fed on humans. FA indices for wing shape differed significantly among host-feeding sources, ecotopes and sexes. The patterns of wing asymmetry in females <b>from</b> <b>domiciles</b> and <b>from</b> goat corrals were significantly different; differences in male FA were congruent with evidence showing that they had higher mobility than females across habitats. The host-feeding sources and habitats of T. infestans affected wing developmental stability depending on sex...|$|R

40|$|Wing {{geometric}} morphometry of Triatoma infestans (Klug) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) {{populations in}} northwestern Argentina showed that individual collection sites represent the discrete unit where metric differentiation took place. Here we studied temporal variations in wing {{size and shape}} of T. infestans populations from defined capture sites on three occasions between 2000 and 2003. Bugs collected <b>from</b> <b>domiciles</b> and/or storerooms had significantly larger right-wing centroid size than bugs collected at goat and/or pig corrals by the end of summer 2000 for both sexes. Conversely, male bugs collected <b>from</b> <b>domiciles</b> and/or storerooms had significantly smaller centroid size than bugs collected from pig corrals in spring 2002. The inversion in wing centroid size between seasons was consistent between sexes. Wing shape analysis from the south-central extreme of the study village showed divergence between collection dates for both sexes. Wing shape divergence was highly significant between male bugs collected by the end of summer 2000 and those collected in spring 2002 {{and by the end of}} summer 2003. For females, wing shape divergence was marginally significant between the end of summer 2000 and spring 2002, and significant between spring 2002 and the end of summer 2003. Unlike season-related variations in wing centroid size...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we employ dichotomous, multinomial and {{conditional}} logit models {{in order to}} analyse the employment-migration behaviour of some 300, 000 UK university graduates. By controlling {{for a range of}} variables related to human-capital acquisition and local economic conditions, we are able to distinguish between different types of sequential migration behaviour <b>from</b> <b>domicile</b> to higher education and on to employment. Our findings indicate that UK female graduates are generally more migratory than male graduates. We suggest that the explanation for this result {{lies in the fact that}} migration can be used as a partial compensation mechanism for gender bias in the labour market. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{one aspect of}} agglomeration, namely the {{geography}} of human capital. In some contexts, human capital may be very mobile, and understanding local agglomeration processes therefore requires us to consider inter-regional flows of human capital. In particular, here we discuss the flows of students in Great Britain <b>from</b> <b>domicile</b> into university and then the flows of graduate human capital from university into first employment. We then estimate the local/non-local pattern of these flows {{as a function of}} the characteristics of the university, of the student population, and of the local region. Our findings suggest that university attendance in Great Britain is generally associated with very significant levels of human capital mobility, and only certain types of higher education institutions play a significant employment role in their local economies.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Entomology, Washington State UniversityCross-pollination by bees is {{necessary}} for commercial alfalfa seed production. To maintain varietal purity in alfalfa, seed producers adhere to spatial isolation standards to minimize or prevent bee flight and subsequent pollen flow between fields. The increased use of genetically-engineered (GE) crops in agriculture has raised concerns over pollinator-mediated gene flow between transgenic and conventional agricultural varieties. The 2011 deregulation of genetically engineered glyphosate-resistant alfalfa by the USDA has generated public concern and scientific debate over current recommended bee management practices {{and their ability to}} maintain varietal purity of alfalfa grown for seed production. The primary objective of this research is to determine the roles that pollinators play in contributing to undesired gene flow between alfalfa fields. We evaluated the impact of migratory beekeeping practices on transgenic pollen flow between spatially isolated alfalfa fields by permitting honey bees, Apis mellifera, to openly forage upon transgenic alfalfa blossoms, and transporting them 112 km to forage on caged conventional alfalfa following either 8 or 32 hours of isolation from the transgenic source. Cross-pollination between transgenic and conventional alfalfa was nearly eliminated (0. 00008 %) following eight hours of isolation from the transgenic source. The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (ALCB), is another commercially managed pollinator used extensively in alfalfa pollination. We evaluated the influence of the ALCB on gene flow between GE and conventional alfalfa seed fields by testing for the presence of the GE trait in pollen provisions collected <b>from</b> <b>domiciles</b> located in conventional alfalfa seed fields planted directly adjacent to GE alfalfa fields. Pollen samples collected <b>from</b> <b>domiciles</b> in conventional seed fields were at variable distances from the adjacent GE fields. Alfalfa seed in the vicinity of each domicile was harvested and tested for the transgene. We found that the ALCB frequently forages at distances which exceed current estimates for ALCB foraging range. Additionally, GE trait expression in harvested conventional seed was detected at rates that surpass established thresholds for varietal purity. Measurable impacts of ALCB-mediated pollen flow were confirmed and can be used to inform science policy regarding the development of best management practices mitigating undesired gene flow between genetically distinct alfalfa varieties.
