40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine background concentrations of metals and organic compounds in biotic and abiotic components of the Fort NiobraralValentine National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) Complex and document these results to utilize as baseline information for future contaminants investigations. To establish this baseline, sediment, water, and biotic samples (fish, double crested cormorant eggs, and vegetation) were collected from Fort Niobrara and Valentine National Wildlife Refuge in 1995 and tested for inorganic and organic contaminants. lnorganics were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometer (lCP) scans. Arsenic and selenium were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). Mercury levels were determined by cold vapor atomic absorption. Organochlorine scans were performed by capillary gas chromatography with an electron capture detector to determine organic contaminant levels. Elevated inorganic contaminant concentrations were detected in water, sediment, plant, and fish samples collected from each refuge. Only aluminum appeared elevated in water samples collected from Valentine NWR. Aluminum and arsenic appeared elevated at Fort Niobrara NWR. At Valentine NWR, elevated concentrations of metals in sediment were limited to one of the three sediment samples from Pelican Lake (Valentine NWR), which contained elevated levels in 11 of 19 metals analyzed. Aquatic plants collected from Valentine NWR showed very limited contamination; only boron was elevated in the <b>common</b> star <b>duckweed</b> collected from Marsh Lake.

40|$|The American duckweed Lemna minuta Kunth is {{considered}} an invasive species in several European countries (e. g., Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy), but its invasiveness outside its original range remains poorly studied. We therefore analyse: (i) {{the speed with which}} L. minuta has spread throughout Europe; and (ii) its capability to compete with L. minor L., the most <b>common</b> European native <b>duckweed.</b> Based on literature data, the increasing number of observations of L. minuta since it was reported for the ﬁrst time in France (1966) indicated the wide extent reached by this species in most of Europe, highlighting its high capacity to colonize new areas. By samplingLemna populations from 41 stations in standing waters in Central Italy, it emerged that the frequency of the two species was similar, but the alien species was more abundant than the native one, showing generally higher coverages, and predominating in mixed Lemna populations. A negative correlation between L. minuta and L. minor was observed in our study. This relationship was not explained by different ecological requirements, since the two species responded similarly to the main environmental gradient, but was linked to an antagonistic dynamism between both species. A multitemporal analysis, based on the comparison of Lemna coverage data recorded at the same stations at two different times (last vs. ﬁrst record), revealed that L. minuta had appeared where it had been absent previously and that its abundance had increased to the detriment of L. minor, which in some cases disappeared within a few years. The arrival of L. minuta in a site can be considered a real threat to conservation of the native plant diversity due to its competition with the congeneric L. minor...|$|R
40|$|Certains procédés d’épuration {{extensive}} des eaux usées utilisent les lentilles d’eau. Les rejets des eaux usées sont de plus en plus sujets à des pollutions de natures diverses, notamment les métaux lourds. Dans ce travail, on procède à une évaluation comparée de la tolérance et de l’accumulation de deux métaux lourds, le cuivre et le chrome, par deux espèces de lentilles d’eau Lemna minor et Lemna gibba. Bien que sous climat de type méditerranéen, L. gibba soit plus utilisée que L. minor, les données disponibles dans la littérature concernent plutôt L. minor. L’évaluation des paramètres toxicologiques montre chez L. gibba une tolérance nettement supérieure aux effets toxiques des deux métaux expérimentés. Le chrome est moins toxique que le cuivre et s’accumule à des taux supérieurs à ceux du cuivre dans les tissus des plantes. Pour les deux métaux, l’accumulation est plus importante chez L. minor. Cependant, on pense que L. gibba serait plus indiquée dans des applications en phytoremédiation que L. minor, vu sa tolérance et sa productivité en biomasse. Les potentialités de ces deux espèces pour des applications de ce type se justifient par des taux d’accumulation fort élevés, spécialement pour le chrome où ils dépassent largement les 1000  µg g‑ 1 de poids sec. En effet, les concentrations des plantes en Cr obtenues dans ce travail atteignent 2140  µg g‑ 1 chez L. minor et 1710  µg g‑ 1 chez L.  gibba. Ces performances montrent un potentiel fort intéressant en comparaison à d’autres macrophytes comme la jacinthe d’eau par exemple. Natural {{wastewater treatment}} technologies are {{common practice in}} many regions of the world. Although these technologies are normally meant for domestic wastewater treatment, they can have broader applications such as the treatment of water contaminated by heavy metals. Among various existing technologies, systems that use duckweed are exploited for wastewater treatment in various regions of the world. In Morocco, this type of system has been tested on an experimental scale and a pilot scale. The most <b>common</b> <b>duckweeds</b> species are Lemna minor L. and Lemna gibba L. L. gibba is used in Mediterranean climates more often than L. minor, but literature data on the tolerance and accumulation of heavy metals are mostly available for L. minor. In the current study, we compared the tolerance and accumulation of two heavy metals, copper (Cu) and chromium (Cr), for these two duckweed species. Thus, this study compares the potential of these two duckweed species {{to be used as}} a method of decontaminanting Cu‑ and Cr‑contaminated water. The experimental design used hydroponic crops of the two species. Forty fronds of each species were sown in plastic pots containing 100  mL of White nutritive solution with a pH adjusted to 6. 8. As experimental treatments, we used exposures corresponding to the following concentrations: 0. 5; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5  mg Cu/L and 3; 5; 10; 20; 30; 35  mg Cr/L. Each treatment was repeated five times. In order to compensate for water loss by evapotranspiration, we added 15  mL of the corresponding solution to each treatment daily. Generally, the results obtained confirm that Cu is more toxic than Cr and that the two species of duckweed have different tolerance levels; L. minor is more sensitive than L. gibba for both metals. For Cu, we observed a highly significant inhibition of growth in response to the gradient of Cu concentrations used, the growth of L.  minor being more affected than that of L.  gibba. For example, the time required for L.  minor colonies to double was more than four days for 1  mg Cu/L, whereas for L.  gibba this was observed only at 3  mg Cu/L. The toxicological parameters reflect this observation as L.  minor had both a lower NOEC (No Observed Effect Concentration) and a lower IC 50 (50 % Inhibition Concentration) than those reported for L.  gibba. Comparatively, these results show a higher tolerance of Cu contamination for L. gibba. For Cr, L. minor was more sensitive than L. gibba, but in much less marked way than for Cu. Indeed, the time required to double the colony size and the NOEC value were similar for the two species, whereas the IC 50 of L. minor was lower than that of L. gibba. The comparison of the rate of inhibition confirms a slightly greater sensitivity of L. minor to Cr exposure. The Cu and Cr concentrations in the biomass increased with the concentration of metal; the highest contents were observed in the treatments with the highest concentrations used: 5  mg Cu/L and 10  mg Cr/L. However, the BCF (Bioconcentration Factor) decreased with the concentration of the treatment; the highest values were observed for the treatments with the lowest concentrations (1  mg Cu/l and 3  mg Cr/L). With respect to possible applications in phytoremediation, the potential use of these two species would be more efficient for low levels of contamination. The two species accumulate the two metals at different rates; the accumulation of Cr is greater than that of Cu and L. minor shows higher rates of accumulation. Copper concentrations of approximately 800  µg/g were obtained in L. minor exposed to 5  mg Cu/L. For Cr, concentrations were approximately 2140  µg/g obtained in L. minor exposed to 10  mg Cr/L. For L. gibba, the maximum concentrations obtained were 745  µg/g and 1710  µg/g respectively for the treatments of 5  mg Cu/L and 10  mg Cr/L. Similarly, the BCF estimated at L. minor was higher than that of L. gibba. Compared with other macrophyte species, the duckweeds show a very interesting potential for metal accumulation. Indeed, for Cu, accumulation was definitely higher than that for other species such as Eichhornia crassipes and Polygonum hydropiperoides. The BCF obtained was higher than those observed for species of Typha and Spartina. These results confirm that L. minor and L. gibba could be good Cu accumulating species compared to other macrophytes. For Cr, other species of macrophytes accumulate this metal to a greater or lesser extent: E. crassipes (slower rate than that of the duckweeds), Nymphea alba (similar rate to that of the duckweeds) or Azolla pinnata (higher rate than the duckweeds). The Cr contents accumulated by the two duckweed species would justify their classification as hyperaccumulator species. With respect to tolerance, accumulation potential and biomass productivity, L.  gibba shows potential as a species that could be used in phytoremediation and in particular the rhizofiltration of wastewater contaminated by Cu and Cr...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Salinity has {{adverse effects}} on plants {{and is one of}} the causes of {{environment}} degradation. Plants have developed many defensive mechanisms, protecting them from sodium chloride (NaCl), including accumulation of osmoprotective compounds, which maintain osmotic balance, protect cell structure and enzymes. In the current study, we investigated the effects of salinity resulting from a range of sodium chloride concentrations (from 0 to 400 mM) on the growth of <b>common</b> <b>duckweed</b> (Lemna minor L.) and yellow lupin (Lupinus luteus L.). Increasing concentration of sodium chloride decreased the area of <b>common</b> <b>duckweed</b> leaves. At the highest applied salt concentration, the decrease of leaf area was associated with leaf chlorosis. In yellow lupin, the increasing sodium chloride concentration inhibited root and stem elongation. The highest tested NaCl concentration of 400 mM completely stopped elongation of yellow lupin shoots. The content of cyclitols and soluble carbohydrates in plant tissues was evaluated as well. Cyclitols (D-chiro-inositol and D-pinitol), as well as soluble carbohydrates (glucose, fructose and sucrose) were detected in <b>common</b> <b>duckweed</b> tissues. Yellow lupin seedlings also contained cyclitols – D-pinitol, myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol – and soluble carbohydrates – glucose, galactose and sucrose.
