40|$|The {{characterisation}} of the compositional condition (particle dissolution/precipitation level),and the microstructural condition (austenite {{grain size}} and deformation state) are ofvital {{importance for the}} subsequent phase transformations which occur during <b>continuous</b> <b>cooling</b> after thermomechanical processes of microalloyed steels. Thermoelectric power (TEP) measurement has been revealed as powerful method to analyse dissolution/precipitation processes together with recovery and recrystallisation phenomena. In this sense, this paper deals with characterising the austenitising condition by two fundamental parameters such as the prior austenite grain size (PAGS) and TEP. Likewise, to validate this hypothesis, the austenitising condition after a forging process in a medium carbon microalloyed steel has been simulated by a simple heat treatment which reproduce the same PAGS and TEP values. A comparison between the <b>continuous</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>transformations</b> occurred from both conditions, allow us to confirm that these parameters well characterise the autenite state of a microalloyed steel.

50|$|Above 900 °C {{a typical}} {{low-carbon}} steel is composed entirely of austenite, a high temperature phase of iron (the other being delta-ferrite at even higher temperatures). Below around 700 °C (727 °C in eutectic iron) the austenite is thermodynamically unstable and, under equilibrium conditions, it will undergo a eutectoid reaction and form pearlite - an interleaved mixture of ferrite and cementite (Fe3C). In {{addition to the}} thermodynamic considerations indicated by the phase diagram, the phase transformations in steel are heavily influenced by the chemical kinetics. This leads {{to the complexity of}} steel microstructures which are strongly influenced by the cooling rate. This can be illustrated by a <b>continuous</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>transformation</b> (CCT) diagram which plots the time required to form a phase when a sample is cooled at a specific rate thus showing regions in time-temperature space from which the expected phase fractions can be deduced for a given thermal cycle.|$|E
5000|$|Dual-phase steel (DP steel) is a {{high-strength}} steel {{that has a}} ferritic-martensitic microstructure.DP steels are produced from low or medium carbon steels that are quenched from a temperature above A1 but below A3 determined from <b>continuous</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>transformation</b> diagram.This results in a microstructure consisting of a soft ferrite matrix containing islands of martensite as the secondary phase (martensite increases the tensile strength).Therefore, the overall behavior of DP steels is governed by the volume fraction, morpology (size, aspect ratio, interconnectivity, etc.), the grain size and the carbon content.For achieving these microstructures, DP steels typically contain 0.06-0.15 wt.% C and 1.5-3% Mn (the former strengthens the martensite, and the latter causes solid solution strengthening in ferrite, while both stabilize the austenite), Cr & Mo (to retard pearlite or bainite formation), Si (to promote ferrite transformation), V and Nb (for precipitation strengthening and microstructure refinement).The desire to produce high strength steels with formability greater than microalloyed steel led the development of DP steels in the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of plastic deformation and cooling conditions on a structure and a shape of CCT-diagrams of new-developed Nb-Ti-V microalloyed steel. Design/methodology/approach: The diagrams of undeformed and plastically-deformed supercooled austenite transformations for Nb-Ti-V microalloyed steel were determined. A part of the specimens were austenitized at a temperature of 885 °C and next cooled to ambient temperature with a various rate from 234 °C/s to 1 °C/min. To investigate the influence of plastic deformation on a shape of CCT (<b>Continuous</b> <b>Cooling</b> <b>Transformations)</b> diagrams, {{another part of the}} specimens were 50 % deformed at 885 °C or 1100 °C and cooled to ambient temperature with a rate from 95 °C/s to 1 °C/min. The DIL 805 A/D dilatometer, with a LVDT-type measuring head, was used to carry out dilatometric test. Findings: Performed dilatometric research revealed that the steel is characterized with Ac 3 = 843 °C, Ac 1 = 707 °C and a relatively low Ms temperature equal 370 °C. Plastic deformation of steel at the temperature of 885 °C {{prior to the start of}} phase transformations results in distinct acceleration of pearlitic transformation and slight translation of bainitic transformation towards shorter times. Research limitations/implications: Elaborated curves of supercooled austenite transformations of studied steel fully predispose it to production of forgings quenched directly from forging finish temperature and successively subjected to high temperature tempering. Practical implications: The obtained CCT diagrams of supercooled plastically-deformed austenite transformations can be useful in determination of cooling condition of the thermo-mechanical processing for high strength forged machine parts obtained from microalloyed steels.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the effects}} of strain path {{reversal}} on microstructure evolution, in terms of austenite grain subdivision and its recrystallisation as well as <b>continuous</b> <b>cooling</b> phase <b>transformations,</b> are investigated using an API X- 70 grade microalloyed steel and two non-transforming austenitic model alloys, namely 316 L and Fe- 30 %wtNi with low and medium stacking fault energies (SFE), respectively. The flow stress-strain and static recrystallisation behaviours of the X- 70 steel were studied by monotonic and interrupted hot plane strain compression (PSC) tests. A fraction softening parameter calculated from "double-hit" PSC tests {{has been found to}} be capable of quick outlining the partial recrystallisation temperature region without complicated microstructure analysis involved. When hot deformed to medium strains (Evm=O. 3 ~ 0. 5) in austenite non-recrystallisation temperature region by forward-reverse torsion tests, simple strain path changes do not impose significant influence on the microstructural evolution of this X- 70 steel through <b>continuous</b> <b>cooling</b> phase <b>transformations.</b> The post-deformation <b>cooling</b> rate is the more influential factor which determines the transformation mechanisms and microstructure, therefore mechanical properties of the final products. However, when subjected to large accumulative strains (Evm 2. 0), {{the effects of}} multiple strain path reversals combined with small amplitude of each forward strain are found to be very profound on microstructural evolutions in austenite studied by hot cyclical torsion using two non-transforming model alloys. The formation of high angle boundaries (HABs) by austenite grain subdivision was significantly delayed by multiple strain path reversals in the Fe- 30 wt%Ni model alloy with medium SFE. Dynamic recrystallisation (DRX) of austenite in low SFE 316 L stainless steel was almost completely suppressed by multiple strain path reversals. Dynamic strain induced transformation (DSIT) in the X- 70 steel was also found to be inhibited by multiple strain path reversals when deformed to large strains between the Ac 3 and Ar 3 temperatures by similar hot cyclical torsions which were applied to model austenitic alloys. Interpretations of the observations were made by correlating the behaviour of the austenite in X- 70 steel, which could not be directly observed easily, to the observations on microstructural evolution made in the two model austenitic alloys. This provides better insights into the transformation mechanisms of DSIT process. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of plastic deformation and cooling conditions on a structure and a shape of CCT-diagrams of new-developed TRIP-aided microalloyed steels. Design/methodology/approach: The diagrams of undeformed and plastically-deformed supercooled austenite transformations for low-carbon and medium-carbon microalloyed steels were determined. A part of the specimens were austenitized at a temperature of 1100 °C, then slowly cooled to 900 °C and next cooled to ambient temperature with a various rate from 1 to 300 °C/s. To investigate the influence of plastic deformation on a shape of CCT (<b>Continuous</b> <b>Cooling</b> <b>Transformations)</b> diagrams, {{another part of the}} specimens were 50 % deformed at 900 °C and cooled to ambient temperature with a rate from 88 to 1 °C/s. The DIL 805 A/D dilatometer, with a LVDT-type measuring head, was used to carry out dilatometric tests. Findings: It was found that a shape of CCT diagrams of elaborated steels predisposes them for multiphase sheets manufacturing. The new-developed steels possess ferritic and bainitic bays put forward to short times and pearlitic regions put aside. However, cooling the steel with a constant rate from austenitizing temperature doesn’t lead to obtaining proper participation of ferrite. Plastic deformation of steel has a profitable influence on the shape of supercooled austenite curves. The region of γ→α transformation is translated to the left at simultaneous raise of start temperature of austenite into ferrite transformation resulting in definitely higher ferrite fraction. Moreover, significant refinement of microstructure in a whole range of cooling rate was also obtained. Research limitations/implications: To increase the ferrite fraction, modification of the cooling after hot-working finishing should be applied. In the fist stage, steel should be rapidly cooled in order to enter the range of γ→α transformation and successively slowly cooled in a range of γ→α transformation. Practical implications: The obtained CCT diagrams of supercooled plastically-deformed austenite transformations can be useful in a determination of cooling in the thermo-mechanical processing for TRIP-type steel sheets. Originality/value: The diagrams of the plastically-deformed supercooled austenite for TRIP-type microalloyed steels were obtained...|$|R
40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels (DSS) constitute both ferrite and austenite as a matrix. Such a microstructure confers a high corrosion resistance with favorable mechanical properties. However, intermetallic phases such as {sigma} and {chi} can also form during casting or high-temperature processing and can degrade {{the properties of}} the DSS. This research was initiated to develop time-temperature-transformation (TTT) and continuous-cooling-transformation (CCT) diagrams of two types of cast duplex {{stainless steels}}, CD 3 MN (Fe- 22 Cr- 5 Ni-Mo-N) and CD 3 MWCuN (Fe- 25 Cr- 7 Ni-Mo-W-Cu-N), {{in order to understand the}} time and temperature ranges for intermetallic phase formation. The alloys were heat treated isothermally or under controlled cooling conditions and then characterized using conventional metallographic methods that included tint etching, and also using electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) and wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS). The kinetics of intermetallic-phase ({sigma} + {chi}) formation were analyzed using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (MA) equation in the case of isothermal transformations and a modified form of this equation in the case of <b>continuous</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>transformations.</b> The rate of intermetallic-phase formation was found to be much faster in CD 3 MWCuN than CD 3 MN due mainly to differences in the major alloying contents such as Cr, Ni and Mo. To examine in more detail the effects of these elements of the phase stabilities; a series of eight steel castings was designed with the Cr, Ni and Mo contents systematically varied with respect to the nominal composition of CD 3 MN. The effects of varying the contents of alloying additions on the formation of intermetallic phases were also studied computationally using the commercial thermodynamic software package, Thermo-Calc. In general, {sigma} was stabilized with increasing Cr addition and {chi} by increasing Mo addition. However, a delicate balance among Ni and other minor elements such as N and Si also exists. Phase equilibria in DSS can be affected by local composition fluctuations in the cast alloy. This may cause discrepancy between thermodynamic prediction and experimental observation...|$|R

It was verified that both alloys developed a bainitic microstructure with low C content, commonly designed by the literature as “granular ” bainite. The hardenability of the ULCB steel was greater than the HSLA- 80 due to the presence of Nb, B and Mo in the first alloy. The age hardening behavior of these alloys was slightly different between each other. The HSLA- 80 steel developed maximum hardness during a 600 ◦ C age hardening, while for the ULCB steel this occurred at a 500 or 600 ◦ C age hardening and took less time. Both steels showed a significant hardness decrease during the 700 ◦ C age hardening, that was probably due to overaging and tempering effects...|$|R
