40|$|Traditionally, {{individuals}} {{engaged in}} correspondence course study were isolated {{in that they}} had no venue to communicate with fellow students. They used the telephone if and when they needed assistance from the instructor. Computer-mediated communication (CMC) has changed distance education study. Students are now engaged in computer conferences as part of the course requirements. The students are now able to interact with fellow students and the instructor. Most computer systems have the capability of producing a transcript of these interactions. The transcript becomes a valuable resource in charting patterns of interaction within the course conference(s). This study utilized a content analysis research design to determine the patterns of interaction in one <b>computer-mediated</b> <b>conference</b> from a graduate-level distance education university course. The Computer Mediated Communication Transcript Analysis Tool (CMC TAT) was used to conduct the content analysis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} study with quantitative data {{was to examine the}} relationships, in the context of <b>computer-mediated</b> asynchronous <b>conferences,</b> among indicators for the main variables in Moore’s Theory of Transactional Distance. It also examined the relationships between indicators for transactional distance and students’ learning success in classes that utilized the conferences. Participants in the study were students enrolled in distance education courses at a major distance education university in Canada in the fall term of 2002. All participants were volunteers. They completed a questionnaire to describe their perceptions of dialogue, course structure, transactional distance, and their autonomy in their courses. Results of this study partially supported the predicted relationships between variables. Results inconsistent with theory were in the form of correlations too small to be statistically significant rather than being of opposite sign. There was a relatively high proportion of statistically significant correlations between dialogue and transactional distance; they showed high dialogue corresponded with low transactional distance. Structure variables separated into two groups; one appeared unrelated to transactional distance and the other showed positive correlations with it. There were few significant correlations between autonomy and transactional distance, autonomy and structure, or structure and dialogue indicators. One group of dialogue indicators showed a high proportion of significant correlations with autonomy indicators, all of which were positive; the rest showed very few. There were no significant correlations between transactional distance and student learning success indicators. The results of this study were consistent with Moore’s statement that dialogue, structure, autonomy and transactional distance refer to clusters of variables...|$|R
40|$|The {{telecommunications}} industry {{is undergoing a}} metamorphic change. New technologies have made possible a vast panorama of new services. Electronic newspapers, videotelephones, and <b>computer-mediated</b> <b>conferences</b> {{are but a few}} of the possibilities. In contrast to technology, most of the other factors affecting the industry (and its infrastructure) have not changed. Government regulations, for example, are based on the 1934 Communications Act. These factors (e. g., consumer behavior, corporate philosophies, energy, and competition) are beginning to change. The Congress is considering a rewrite of the 1934 Communications Act. Competition has become a dominant factor (note that the industry by and large has been a government-regulated monopoly). The outcome of these changes will determine which services will be offered and the extent to which they will be demanded. The problem is to determine which changes will actually occur and, then, forecast their effect. The problem is further complicated by the fact that those individuals and institutions involved in making changes do not know which changes to make. For them, a forecasting system is needed to evaluate the outcome of various changes. A review of the literature was conducted to determine the extent to which the problem was solved. Several forecasts have been generated, but none address the problem in its entirety. Some have examined, in great detail, one or two of the pertinent factors, but ignored the others. Other forecasts have been more global. These assume certain changes will be made. Forecasts are then developed. The problem is that users do not have the option of changing the assumptions. Moreover, most of these forecasters have not specified their assumptions. Following the literature search, an overview of the FORTEL System is given. FORTEL is designed to forecast service and terminal equipment demand. The system synthesizes forecasters 2 ̆ 7 assumptions about industry change with quantitative demand models. The system also provides the forecaster with the ability to change assumptions and evaluate the outcome; i. e., test alternative scenarios. There are three major components: model, user assumptions, and the computer program. The model component consists of four demand models. For each market (residential and business), there are service and terminal models. User assumptions reflect the forecaster 2 ̆ 7 s outlook on the future of the {{telecommunications industry}}. The assumptions are divided into five categories. The general category reflects assumptions about the industry in general, the economy, societal change, and energy. Technology assumptions deal with the future of a variety of new (and existing) technologies. There are several assumptions about services and terminals. These cover a broad range of factors which will directly affect implementation and demand of a particular service or terminal. The final category includes assumptions about the forecasting technique (quantitative techniques) to be used. The computer program is the synthesizing component of the system. It combines the user assumptions with the models to produce the forecast. It also contains the scenario testing facit of the system. Following a detailed description of each component, an output comparison is given. The author has selected three different sets of user assumptions. The forecasts generated from these sets are compared. The three range from a pessimistic outlook (economic recession and energy crisis) to a very prosperous outlook (exponential growth). The thesis concludes with a chapter on follow-on research and a conclusion...|$|R
40|$|With recent {{developments}} in CAD and communication technologies, the way we visualise and communicate design representations is changing. A matter {{of great interest to}} architects, practitioners and researchers alike, is how computer technology might affect the way they think and work. The concern is not about the notion of'support'alone, but about ensuring that computers do not disrupt the design process and collaborative activity already going on (Bannon and Schmidt, 1991). Designing new collaborative tools will then have to be guided by {{a better understanding of how}} collaborative work is accomplished and by understanding what resources the collaborators use and what hindrances they encounter in their work (Finholt et al., 1990). Designing, as a more abstract notion, is different than having a business meeting using video conferencing. In design it is more important to'see'what is being discussed rather than'watch'the other person(s) involved in the discussion. In other words the data being conveyed might be of more importance than the method with which it is communicated (See Kvan, 1994). Similarly, we believe that by using text instead of audio as a medium for verbal communication, verbal representations can then be recorded alongside graphical representations for later retrieval and use. In this paper we present the results of a study on collaborative design in three different environments: face-to-face (FTF), <b>computer-mediated</b> using video <b>conferencing</b> (CMCD-a), and <b>computer-mediated</b> using “talk by typingi (CMCD-b).

40|$|Asynchronous <b>computer-mediated</b> <b>conferencing</b> (CMC) courses rely on {{sustained}} threaded discourse {{to encourage}} student learning.

Peer moderators typically begin by posing thought-provoking questions to their peers, and it is known that different types of questions are differentially effective for generating higher-order discussion. However, prior literature suggests that students use very few question types, and tend to use types that have been linked to low levels of learning. In this research, we scaffold the questioning process, and then investigate the use and impacts of question type on resultant higher-order thinking. We find that the scaffolding led to a rich variety of question types, and that the evidence suggests new research directions for both Application and Course Link questions...|$|E

40|$|These days {{many people}} {{subscribe}} {{to the view that}} the teacher or teacher-trainer’s role should principally be that of facilitator, rather than “fountainhead of knowledge” Greater equality between trainers and trainees is regarded as beneficial to the learning process; it empowers trainees to select their own learning styles and question received wisdom, whilst it also permits trainers to step back from centre stage to a position where they can observe the learning process. <b>Computer-mediated</b> <b>conferencing</b> (cmc), apart from its value as a means of distance learning, offers opportunities for trainer-trainee equality that are unimaginable in the face-to-face classroom.

40|$|Supervisor: Dr. Martha Cleveland-InnesThis interpretive {{approach}} to a mixed-method study examines the likelihood that {{an awareness of the}} role of emotion as presented by Damasio and LeDoux enhances individual student participation in <b>computer-mediated</b> <b>conferencing.</b> Consideration is given to emotion as an element of social presence as defined in the community of inquiry conceptual model, proposed by Garrison, Anderson and Archer. Respondents participated in an online workshop, during which they were asked how the role of emotion in cognition might be applicable to distance education. Surveys and interviews were conducted to determine the level of their knowledge of emotion and cognition at the outset. Transcripts of conference postings were examined for evidence that learning had or had not transferred. Exit interviews and surveys determined if the workshops had enhanced or not enhanced the experience {{of the participants in the}} computer-mediated conference. Three of twelve participants acknowledged that participation in the workshop did engender a positive change in their normal conference participation behaviour. Three of the remaining nine stated unequivocally that the workshop had no influence. The others were unable to contribute useful data due to technical difficulties or limited participation. Although data were insufficient to support the research question there was evidence that emotion should be a fourth presence – called emotional presence - defined as the extent to which participants in a community of inquiry are aware of and attend to overt feelings and covert emotions with the intention of facilitating learning. The community of inquiry model and the distinction between emotion and feeling need further study. The latter concepts require study in an online context...|$|E
40|$|Asynchronous online discussions {{have the}} {{potential}} to improve learning in universities. This thesis reports an investigation into the ways in which undergraduates learned in online discussions when they were included within their face-to-face courses. Taking a student perspective, four case studies describe and explain the approaches to learning that were used by business undergraduates in online discussions, and examine the influence of the <b>computer-mediated</b> <b>conferencing</b> (CMC) medium and curriculum design on student learning. The investigation took a qualitative approach where case studies were developed from multiple data sources. In each of the cases, a description of the setting of the online discussions introduced the learning environment. Further details of student learning behaviours in the online discussions were provided by an analysis of the systems data and a content analysis of the online discussion transcripts. In depth interpretation of interview data added student perspectives on the impact of CMC characteristics, the curriculum or learning design and the relationship between the online discussions and face-to-face classes. A comparative cross case analysis of the findings of the four cases identified and discussed general themes and broad principles arising from the cases. The campus-based students acknowledged that online discussions helped them to learn and their message postings evidenced deep approaches to learning. The students recognised the value for learning of the text based nature of the CMC environment but peer interaction was more difficult to achieve. Asynchronicity created time flexibility and time for reflection but it also presented time management problems for many undergraduates. Assessment was the most influential aspect of the curriculum design. The cases also identified the importance of a dialogical activity and the absence of the teacher from the online discussions was not problematic. The research identified new perspectives on the relationship between online discussions and face-to-face classes. Students regarded these two media as complementary rather than oppositional and affirmed the importance of pedagogic connections between them. A teaching and learning framework for online discussions was developed from these perspectives. The significance of this study lies in improved knowledge of student learning processes in online discussions in blended learning environments. The cases indicated the potential value of the CMC environment for constructivist philosophies and affirm the significant role of curriculum design with new technologies. Findings relating to the complementary nature of online and face to face discussions provided a platform for building a teaching and learning framework for blended environments which can be used to inform and improve pedagogical design, teacher expertise and student learning outcomes in asynchronous online discussions...|$|E
