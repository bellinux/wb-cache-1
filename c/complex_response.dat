We analyzed the growth, photophysiology {{and composition of}} small, Thalassiosira pseudonana, and large, Thalassiosira punctigera, centric diatoms from temperate, coastal marine habitats, responding to a matrix of photoperiods and growth light intensities. T. pseudonana showed fastest growth rates under long photoperiods and low to moderate light intensities, while the larger T. punctigera showed fastest growth rates under short photoperiods and higher light intensities. Photosystem II function and content responded primarily to instantaneous growth light intensities during the photoperiod, while diel carbon fixation and RUBISCO content responded more to photoperiod duration than to instantaneous light intensity. Changing photoperiods caused species-specific changes in the responses of photochemical yield(e(-) /photon) to growth light intensity. These photophysiological variables showed <b>complex</b> <b>responses</b> to photoperiod and to growth light intensity.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the effects of different dynamic scheduling heuristic rules {{on the design of}} Real-Time Systems (RTS) which allow for the execution of <b>complex</b> <b>responses.</b> <b>Complex</b> <b>responses</b> are characterized by the concurrent nature of activity execution. RTS design will be done {{through the use of a}} simulator which allows for the selection of the external event characteristics, definition of the RTS (processes, due dates, activity-to-resource allocations with activity execution times) and selection of different activity scheduling schemes (first-come first-served, earliest due date, shortest activity first, etc. [...] .). Statistics, such as response execution times, waiting times of ready-to-execute activities, percentage of responses that are tardy and resource utilization, are gathered and provided to the designer. These statistics allow the designer to refine the design, by changing system parameters, until satisfactory RTS operation is achieved. In this study, the RTS will be implemented on a centrally coordinated multiple processor system topology. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

Thirty nine athletes of 16. 5 years old, N= 13 sprinters and jumpers, N= 13 soccer players, and N= 13 judokas participated in the experiment. Pearson correlations, a one–way ANOVA and an independent t-test for establishing differences between those three groups of athletes was applied.

The strong correlation occurred between <b>complex</b> <b>responses</b> and speed; 20 m from standing and 20 m fl ying start (r= 0. 62 and r= 0. 65 respectively).

50|$|Shade {{avoidance}} {{response in}} adult plants is less commonly studied {{than it is}} in seedlings, though adult Arabidopsis show more <b>complex</b> <b>response</b> patterns than seedlings. Shaded adults have elongated petioles at the rosette, smaller leaf blades, and suppressed axillary bud growth. By elongating the petiole sideways, the plant repositions its leaves away from shading plants to absorb more red light, though there is a trade off in leaf size. The leaves can also bend upwards towards potential light sources as a result of higher growth {{on the underside of the}} petiole than the top, a process called hyponasty. Flattening of leaves in plants with normally curled leaves also increases surface area for light absorption.|$|E

50|$|The {{first decade}} of {{research}} focused on physiologic profile of the penumbra tissue after stroke, mapping the cerebral blood flow, and quantifying oxygen and glucose consumption to define these areas. The second decade revealed the mechanism of the neuronal cell death. As the Biochemical pathways were dissected penumbral science became a rapidly evolving area of molecular biology. The third decade of penumbral research found a transitional leap as using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning can identify brain tissue with decreased blood flow and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) {{has the ability to}} detect portions of the ischemic tissue that has not yet died. These images have allowed vision into the brain to see the areas of tissue that may be salvaged, the penumbra. Research has now entered into the fourth decade, which leaves researchers wondering why the penumbra has failed as {{there has not been a}} neuroprotectant found.

50|$|The MAX phases as a {{class are}} {{generally}} stiff, lightweight, and plastic at high temperatures. Due to the layered atomic structure of these compounds, some, like Ti3SiC2 and Ti2AlC, are also creep and fatigue resistant, and maintain their strengths to high temperatures. They exhibit unique deformation characterized by basal slip (evidences of out-of-basal plane dislocations and dislocation cross-slips were recently reported in MAX phase deformed at high temperature), a combination of kink and shear band deformation, and delaminations of individual grains. During mechanical testing, {{it has been found}} that polycrystalline Ti3SiC2 cylinders can be repeatedly compressed at room temperature, up to stresses of 1 GPa, and fully recover upon the removal of the load while dissipating 25% of the energy. It was by characterizing these unique mechanical properties of the MAX phases that kinking non-linear solids were discovered. The micromechanism supposed to be responsible for these properties is the incipient kink band (IKB). However no direct evidence of these IKBs has been yet obtained, thus leaving the door open to other mechanism that are less assumption-hungry. Indeed, a recent study demonstrates that the reversible hysteretic loops when cycling MAX polycrystals can be as well explained by the <b>complex</b> <b>response</b> of the very anisotropic lamellar microstructure.|$|E
