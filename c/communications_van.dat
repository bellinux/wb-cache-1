In the rear is the WHCA Roadrunner <b>communications</b> <b>van</b> - which provides the primary communications path via satellite, allowing bi-directional voice, data and streaming video - an ambulance, and additional police vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>communications</b> <b>van</b> {{operated}} by FDNY {{responded to the}} incident. Its radio identifier was, [...] "Field Comm." [...] A backup van was in use {{on the day of}} the incident because the primary van was out-of-service. The backup van was destroyed and audio recordings of tactical channels used at the incident site were lost.|$|E
5000|$|In 1968, [...] "after SAC {{completed}} its tests during March, AFSC arranged for {{modification of the}} SAC terminals for use with LES-6" [...] for satellite communications. [...] A SACCS remote <b>communications</b> <b>van</b> completed on 12 July 1968 was shipped to Andersen AFB, Guam, e.g., for supporting the SACADVON (30 SAC B-52s had deployed on 17 February 1965 to Guam for the Vietnam War.) ...|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the money}} was used to design and build {{relocatable}} <b>communications</b> <b>vans</b> that would be activated {{if there was a}} threat of nuclear war. The rationale for relocatable vans was that the National Military Command Center (NMCC) at the Pentagon and the Alternate National Military Command Center (ANMCC) located in the Raven Rock Mountain Complex were already targeted by the Soviet Union and therefore would not survive a nuclear strike. The same criticism could not be leveled at the Boeing E-4 aircraft that made up the National Emergency Airborne Command Posts (NEACP), but the plan for relocatable <b>communications</b> <b>vans</b> went forward nevertheless.|$|R
50|$|The {{relocatable}} <b>communications</b> <b>vans</b> {{that had}} already been built were put under the command of the U. S. Army's 11th Signal Brigade at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. Similarly equipped trucks are presently within the inventory of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), called Multi-Radio Vans.|$|R
50|$|A {{permanent}} UHF {{ground station}} (located in Waldorf, Maryland), {{served as the}} primary communications link between the separate command posts: National Military Command Center, Alternate National Military Command Center, National Emergency Airborne Command Post, and NECPA. Three ground <b>communications</b> <b>vans</b> were located at Otis AFB, MA, Greenville, SC, and Homestead AFB, FL to cover commonly used routes of Presidential aircraft. After President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, vans were moved to Jackson, MS and Austin, TX, to cover President Lyndon B. Johnson’s travel routes.|$|R
50|$|Van Deerlin {{was elected}} to Congress in 1962 from the newly created 37th District, {{becoming}} the first Democrat to represent a San Diego-based district in Congress since Clinton D. McKinnon left office in 1953. He was reelected eight times from this district, which was renumbered the 41st in 1972 and the 42nd in 1975. As chairman of the House Subcommittee on <b>Communications,</b> <b>Van</b> Deerlin encouraged competition in the telecommunications industry by conducting hearings {{that led to the}} breakup of AT&T. He supported a broad interpretation of First Amendment rights for broadcasters.|$|E
50|$|Recordings show radios were {{programmed}} to send unit ID on tactical channels. Radios accept unit ID on a per-channel basis. When mobile or hand-held radios are programmed, the unit ID encoders should be disabled on all channels where the feature is not used. This saves air time {{for about two}} to three syllables of speech per push-to-talk press. For example, unless the <b>communications</b> <b>van</b> or chief's vehicles had push-to-talk unit ID decoders, or the channels were recorded for later analysis where unit IDs were decoded from the recordings, the encoders should be turned off for tactical channels to reduce air time used.|$|E
50|$|The van Eck Professorship of Engineering is a {{professorship}} {{in engineering}} at the University of Cambridge. Founded in 2001, {{it is intended to}} complement the university's work in communications systems and software research within the Department of Engineering and elsewhere. The chair was established through a US$3.5 million bequest from U.S. businessman Fred van Eck whose estate provided funds to create a professorship in the field of advanced science and technology with an emphasis on high-speed <b>communications.</b> <b>Van</b> Eck, who died on 15 March 2000, was an American citizen with substantial business interests in the United States and the Netherlands. The professorship replaces the Professorship of Engineering created in 1965, which has been temporarily suspended.|$|E

50|$|The Van Allen {{radiation}} belts {{swell and}} shrink {{over time as}} part of a much larger space weather system driven by energy and material that erupt off the Sun's surface and fill the entire Solar System. Space weather is the source of aurora that shimmer in the night sky, but it also can disrupt satellites, cause power grid failures and disrupt GPS <b>communications.</b> The <b>Van</b> Allen Probes will help scientists to understand this region and to better design spacecraft that can survive the rigors of outer space. The mission is to gain scientific understanding of how populations of relativistic electrons and ions in space form or change in response to changes in solar activity and the solar wind.|$|R
5000|$|To do this, Van Riper {{adopted an}} {{asymmetric}} strategy. In particular, he used old methods to evade his opponent's sophisticated electronic surveillance network. Van Riper used motorcycle messengers to transmit orders to front-line troops and World War II light signals to launch airplanes without radio <b>communications.</b> <b>Van</b> Riper used {{a fleet of}} small boats to determine {{the position of the}} opponent's fleet by {{the second day of the}} exercise. In a preemptive strike, he launched a massive salvo of cruise missiles that overwhelmed the Blue forces' electronic sensors and destroyed sixteen warships. This included one aircraft carrier, ten cruisers and five of six amphibious ships. An equivalent success in a real conflict would have resulted in the deaths of over 20,000 service personnel. Soon after the cruise missile offensive, another significant portion of the opposing navy was [...] "sunk" [...] by an armada of small Red boats, which carried out both conventional and suicide attacks that capitalized on Blue's inability to detect them as well as expected.|$|E
40|$|Party {{membership}} {{levels in}} the new democracies of central and east European were predicted to remain universally low, stymied by post-communist legacies, the availability of state funding and the prevalence of mass media <b>communications</b> (<b>van</b> Biezen, 2003; Kopecký, 2007). However, {{more than two decades}} {{after the fall of the}} Berlin Wall, membership levels vary considerably between countries, and also between individual parties within party systems. Using freshly gathered party membership data, elite surveys and interviews, this thesis explores a number of institutional hypotheses to test whether, as in western democracies, electoral institutions influence how parties organise and campaign. This thesis finds that national electoral systems, municipal electoral rules and business funding regulations have an observable impact on how parties use their members. In particular, 'decentralised' electoral systems encourage greater involvement of members in voter contacting and other small campaign tasks. This thesis concludes that, contrary to the dominant literature, the availability of state funding has little impact on party membership recruitment. Instead, central and east European parties' attitudes to members are shaped by a complex interaction of institutional, cultural, ideological and strategic factors...|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to Descartes, Elisabeth held correspondence with many others, including various Quakers. Among them most notably were Robert Barclay and William Penn. While {{they seemed to}} have the aim of converting her to their faith, Elisabeth seemed to be focused on the intellectual interest of their ideals and beliefs. She also held a correspondence for a time with the [...] "Dutch Minerva", Anna Maria van Schurman, who encouraged Elisabeth to further her studies in history, physics, and astronomy. While their correspondence was not extensive, Van Schurman was a mentor to Elisabeth and guided her in her scholarly studies. She was respected and revered by Princess Elisabeth to a great degree. Elisabeth asked for her advice on new topics and subjects of study often. Van Schurman took the initiative in giving Elisabeth her opinion on the new discoveries of their time. The area in which they seemed to diverge was in their opinion of Descartes. Elisabeth was intrigued by the new Cartesian philosophy and wanted to learn more about it. Van Schurman, however, emphatically refuted the idea when Elisabeth inquired about it, instead defending the traditional Aristotelian-Christian view. As much as she respected Van Schurman, this did not stop Elisabeth from pursuing her interest in Descartes and his doctrine. Elisabeth eventually contacted Descartes to request his instruction in philosophy and mathematics, keeping a long-standing correspondence and friendship. It has been speculated that Elisabeth's correspondence and deep connection with Descartes effectively ended her <b>communications</b> with <b>Van</b> Schurman.|$|R
50|$|The Reflecting God Study Bible {{is a study}} Bible {{published}} by Zondervan {{in conjunction with the}} Christian Holiness Partnership which, as a Wesleyan revision of the NIV Study Bible, utilized the New International Version (NIV). Following a 10-year negotiation with Zondervan by two publishing consortia, Holiness Publishers Alliance, and Light and Life Communications, Zondervan struck an agreement with the Christian Holiness Partnership resulting in this volume. Publisher of Light and Life <b>Communications,</b> John <b>Van</b> Valin, guided the process, including the selection of the title, through to its sponsorship by Christian Holiness Partnership. While the standard NIV Study Bible serves as the basis of not only the scripture text, but also many portions of the commentary section, interest in publishing this version was in part a response to the failure of the original editorial staff of the NIV Study Bible, to include any significant contribution from Wesleyan-Arminian scholars. In addition, this volume serves the theological interests of vast portions of the evangelical community including such groups as the Salvation Army, Church of the Nazarene, United Methodist Church, the Wesleyan Church, the Free Methodist Church and many other similar groups. Dr. Wayne McCown served as the General Editor of the Reflecting God Study Bible with assistance from Robert D. Branson(Old Testament editor), C. L. (Bud) Bence (New Testament Editor) and 20 other scholars who contributed to the commentary section. This study bible also contains 15 pertinent essays portraying practical applications of the Wesleyan-Arminian theological perspective. This study bible was declared out of print in approximately 2003 by Zondervan Publishing Company.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{derives from}} a study of {{learning}} processes in ten four-year-old children, five at pre-school (their second of three Foundation Stage years) and five in a primary school reception class (their second and final Foundation Stage year) in England. From March 2002 - July 2003, the study examined the sub-cultures of pedagogy, children's learning outcomes and the processes involved {{using a combination of}} methods including ethnographic case study, parent diaries, and extensive video/audio recording. Drawing on sociocultural theory, interactions between participants and between participants and resources, taken to be multimodal <b>communications</b> (Kress and <b>Van</b> Leeuwen 2001), were analysed for broad patterns in the settings and for individual children. This paper considers evidence for tentative links between children's learning outcomes, sub-cultures of pedagogy and interaction patterns. Pre-school offered more opportunities for interactions based on individual experiences, easing negotiated entry into the curriculum, but with less explanation, instruction and modelling, creating a "levelling up" effect in learning outcomes. Reception provided less interactive space for children's initiations or open-ended conversations grounded in their experiences and meanings, but more explanation, exploration and modelling with the whole class, creating outcomes of rapid progress for those with a closer home/school match and "falling behind" of those with a weaker match (author abstract...|$|R
40|$|This {{technical}} report {{is a collection}} of the individual papers submitted to this workshop. At the CHI 2000 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (April 1 - 6, 2000), a workshop was held on "The What, Who, Where, When, and How of Context-Awareness". Context-awareness is widely thought to be an important enabling technology for developing ubiquitous, handheld and wearable computer applications. It describes the ability of a computing device or program to sense, react to, or adapt to the environment in which it is running. In order to understand better how we can use context and facilitate the building of context-aware applications, we need to understand more fully what constitutes a context-aware application and what context is. This workshop attempted to address these issues by asking the six "W" questions of context-awareness: 'what, who, where, when, and why?'. These five questions underpin the sixth meta-question of 'how', for example 'how do we build context-aware applications'?Workshop Overview Paper / David R. Morse, Open University and Anind K.
