The Grassmannian can be {{considered}} as the set of orthogonal pro-jectors of fixed rank in the d-dimensional Euclidean space. <b>Cubatures</b> and de-signs on the Grassmannian have been well-studied in the recent literature. On the other hand, particular sets of projectors with potentially varying ranks have been used in signal processing under the name fusion frames. The relations between <b>cubatures,</b> designs, and fusion frames have already been investigated in the literature when the rank was held fixed. Here, we introduce <b>cubatures</b> and designs in unions of Grassmannians and discuss the relations towards fu-sion frames with varying ranks.

Although Smolyak’s quadrature rule can successfully generate sparse <b>cubature</b> points for high dimensional integral, it has a potential drawback that some <b>cubature</b> points generated by Smolyak’s rule have negative weights, which may result in instability for the computation.

40|$|AbstractAn {{accurate}} and efficient semi-analytic integration technique is developed for three-dimensional hypersingular boundary integral equations of potential theory. Investigated {{in the context}} of a Galerkin approach, surface integrals are defined as limits to the boundary and linear surface elements are employed to approximate the geometry and field variables on the boundary. In the inner integration procedure, all singular and non-singular integrals over a triangular boundary element are expressed exactly as analytic formulae over the edges of the integration triangle. In the outer integration scheme, closed-form expressions are obtained for the coincident case, wherein the divergent terms are identified explicitly and are shown to cancel with corresponding terms from the edge-adjacent case. The remaining surface integrals, containing only weak singularities, are carried out successfully by use of standard numerical <b>cubatures.</b> Sample problems are included to illustrate the performance and validity of the proposed algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Multidimensional growth {{processes}} play {{an important}} role in many fields of applications, such as crystallization processes and cell culture engin- eering. The numerical solution of the corresponding multivariate population balance equations is quite challenging as standard discretization-based methods are not efficient for high dimensional problems. For this reason, the distribution dynamics is often characterized by its moments. However, the moment dynamics generally cannot be calculated in closed form. Existing approximation techniques cannot be implemented efficiently in the multivariate framework, in particular for high dimensional problems. This contribution presents an alternative methodology for the efficient approximate computation of moments for multidimensional growth processes using Monomial <b>Cubatures</b> and the Method of Characteristics (MOC). The procedure will be shown to reproduce the moments accurately for one- and two-dimensional examples which feature nonlinear growth rates and coupling to a continuous phase, respectively. Furthermore numerical effort and accuracy will be analyzed for a five-dimensional benchmark problem. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A fully {{three-dimensional}} anisotropic {{elastic model}} for vascular tissue modelling is here presented. The underlying strain energy density function {{is assumed to}} additively decouple into volumetric and deviatoric contributions. A straightforward isotropic neo-Hooke-type law is used to model the deviatoric response of the ground substance, whereas a micro-structurally or rather micro-sphere-based approach will be employed to model the contribution and distribution of fibres within the biological tissue of interest. Anisotropy was introduced {{by means of the}} use of von Mises orientation distribution functions. Two different micro-mechanical approaches [...] a, say phenomenological, exponential ansatz and a worm-like-chain-based formulation [...] are applied to the micro-fibres and illustratively compared. The passage from micro-structural contributions to the macroscopic response is obtained by a computational homogenisation scheme, namely numerical integration over the surface of the individual micro-spheres. The algorithmic treatment of this integration is discussed in detail for the anisotropic problem at hand, so that several <b>cubatures</b> of the micro-sphere are tested in order to optimise the accuracy at reasonable computational cost. Moreover, the introduced material parameters are identified from simple tension tests on human coronary arterial tissue for the two micro-mechanical models investigated. Both approaches are able to recapture the experimental data. Based on the identified sets of parameters, we first discuss a homogeneous deformation in simple shear to evaluate the models' response at the micro-structural level. Later on, an artery-like two-layered tube subjected to internal pressure is simulated by making use of a non-linear finite element setting. This enables to obtain the micro- and macroscopic responses in an inhomogeneous deformation problem, namely a blood-vessel-representative boundary value problem. The effect of residual stresses is additionally included in the model by means of a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor which turns out to crucially affect the simulation results...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} thesis is the construction of <b>cubature</b> formulae and embedded <b>cubature</b> formulae for integrals over two-dimensional regions. Two mathematical theories that originated in the 19 th century are used to achieve this : invariant theory and ideal theory. A <b>cubature</b> formula is a solution {{of a system of}} nonlinear equations. Invariant theory is useful to construct <b>cubature</b> formulae that are invariant with respect to a group of symmetries, usually the group of symmetries of the region of integration. The original system of nonlinear equations can easily be replaced by a smaller system. For circular symmetric regions a system of equations is obtained that can be solved automatically and quickly. With each <b>cubature</b> formula one can associate an ideal of all polynomials that become zero in the knots of this <b>cubature</b> formula. Ideal theory is used to obtain theoretical results on <b>cubature</b> formulae for integrals over n-dimensional regions, e. g., lower bounds for the number of knots. It is also used to develop methods to construct <b>cubature</b> formulae and sequences of embedded <b>cubature</b> formulae. These methods are used for several two-dimensional regions. Finally the advantages of invariant theory and ideal theory are combined. Some earlier theoretical results on <b>cubature</b> formulae for integrals over n-dimensional regions are generalized to invariant <b>cubature</b> formulae. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Complexity “ {{is for us}} a very ambigous notion. It may be {{understood}} in two contexts. 1. Thorough solution of a problem. Complexity means full recognition of design area, followed by appropriate work. That work must be thorough and interdisciplinary – if necessary, separated to different co-operatives. These trade designers reqiure a branch coordination and – the most important- all of them must have a „common denominator”. Such as a proper CAAD platform and office standards. That will reduce costs of changes, improve an interplay between designers and somtimes enable to face up a new challenge. Nowadays architects are no longer “solitary” individualists working alone – they must concern a team – they become a member, {{a part of a}} huge design machine. “Import/export”, compatibility, interplay – these words must appear and we have to put a stress on them. How to organize work for different trade-designers? How to join in common database architectural design,engineering design, HVAC design, electricity design, technology design, computer network design and all other trades ? [...] . A key to solve this range of problems is in good work organization. Universal prescription does not exist, but some evergreen rules can be observed. We are going to present a scheme of work in CAAD application ALLPLAN FT v. 16 with a Group manager, which starts to conquest polish market and is widely spread in Germany. “Golden rules” of ALLPLAN FT There is one database – it is placed on server. It includes all projects. There is a well-developed office standard. It must be created at the beginning of collaboration, although it is possible to improve it later. It consist of hatches, fonts, symbols, macros, materials, pen-widths, and – the most important –layers. A layer set – predefined structure divided into functional groups – e. g. drafting, text, dimensioning, architecture, HVAC, engineering, urban design, etc. That stucture is a part of an office standard – all workers use a relevant part of it. No name duplicates, no misunderstandings [...] . If however design extends, and a new group of layers is required, it can be easily added, e. g. computer networks, fireguard systems. Administrator of ALLPLAN network defines different users and gives them different permitions of access. For example – an electrician will be able to draft on layer “electricity”, but he won’t modify anything at layer “architecture – walls”, and he won’t even see a layer “engineering- slabs”, because he doesn’t need it [...] At the same time our electrician will be able to see, how architect moves some walls and how HVAC moved and started to cross with his wires. Every user is able to see relevant changes, after they are saved by author. Two different users can not access {{at the same time the}} same file. That excludes inconsistent or overlapping changes. All users operate on a 3 D model. While putting some data into a model, they must remember about a “Z” coordinate at work-storey. But at the same time all create a fully-integrated, synchronous database, which can be used later for bills of quantities, specifications, and – of course – for visuaisation. That method can be described as “model-centric”. To simplify complex structure of architectural object -ALLPLAN offers files. Usually one file means one storey, but at special designs it might become a functional part of a storey, or whatever you wish. Files connected with layers easy enable to separate certain structural elements, e. g. if we want to glance only at concrete slabs and columns in the building – we will turn on all files with “layer filter” – “slabs” and “columns”. ALLPLAN is of course one of possible solutions. We described it, because we use it in our workshop. It seems to be stretchy enough to face up every demand and ever-increasing complexity of current projects. The essence of the matter, however, is not a name or version of application – it is a set of features, we mentioned above, which allows to deal with EVERY project. The number of solutions is infinite. 2. Increasing difficulties during design process. It may be associated with more and more installations inside of new buildings, especially some “high-tech” examples. The number of these installations increases as well as their complexity. Now buildings are full of sensors, video-screens, computer networks, safety-guard systems [...] . Difficulties are connected with some trends in contemporary architecture, for example an organic architecture, which conceives “morphed” shapes, “moving” surfaces, “soft” solids. This direction is specially supported by modelling or CAD applications. Sometimes it is good – they allow to realize all imaginations, but often they lead to produce “unbuildable” forms, which can exist only in virtual world. Obstacles appear, when we design huge <b>cubatures</b> with “dense” functional scheme. Multi-purposed objects, exhibition halls, olimpic stadium at Sydney – all of them have to be stretchy, even if it requires sliding thousands pound concrete blocks! Requirements were never so high. The last reason, why designs become so complex is obvious - intensifying changes due to specific requirements of clients/developers. We could say “ signum tempori” – everything gets more and more complicated, people have to become specialists, to face up new technology. But how CAAD can help us with it? How?! We have already answered that question. Sometimes CAAD is the only way to imagine and sketch something, to visualize something, to compute a construction, to prepare a simulation [...] . So that human must “only” interprete ready solutions. Sometimes CAAD help us to notify a problem. It works exactly in the same way, as spy-glasses does. For example – without a real-time visualization we we would have never realised (until finished!) some strange interference of solids, which have occured in the upper roof part of our new appartment-house. ConclusionsTemporary CAAD is an integral part of design process – not only as a tool, but sometimes as an inspiration. It helps to organize our work, to define problems, to filter relevant elements and to render our visions. It becomes an integral part of our senses – and that will be a real complexity in architecture [...] ...|$|R
