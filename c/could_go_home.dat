5|$|One night {{towards the}} end of 1942, Gröning and his comrades in their SS barracks on the {{outskirts}} of Birkenau were awakened by an alarm. They were told that a number of Jews who were being taken to the gas chambers had escaped and hidden in the woods. They were ordered to take pistols and search the woods. When his group arrived at the extermination area of the camp they saw a farmhouse, in front of which were SS men and the bodies of seven or eight prisoners who had been caught and shot. The SS men told Gröning and his comrades that they <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> but they decided to hang around {{in the shadows of the}} woods.|$|E
5|$|The {{last week}} of {{production}} was fraught with issues. Red gel lights appeared orange upon reviewing the daily footage; the lights were faulty, and three people were nearly electrocuted. On January 26, 1979, the film finally wrapped after 125 days. The three leads (Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley) delivered their final lines at 4:50 pm. Before the crew <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> a final shot had to be filmed — the climactic fusing of Decker and V'Ger. The script prescribed a heavy emphasis on lighting, with spiraling and blinding white lights. Collins was covered in tiny dabs of cotton glued to his jacket; these highlights were designed to create a body halo. Helicopter lights, 4000–watt lamps and wind machines were used to create the effect of Decker's fusion with the living machine. The first attempts at filming the scene became a nightmare for the crew. The extreme lighting caused normally invisible dust particles {{in the air to}} be illuminated, creating the appearance that the actors were caught in a blizzard. During the retakes throughout the week the crew mopped and dusted the set constantly, and it required later technical work to completely eliminate the dust in the final print.|$|E

25|$|During {{this time}} Johnson {{established}} {{what would be}} a relatively long-term relationship with Estella Coleman, a woman about 15 years his senior and the mother of the blues musician Robert Lockwood, Jr. Johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in. He reputedly asked homely young women living in the country with their families whether he <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> with them, and in most cases he was accepted, until a boyfriend arrived or Johnson was ready to move on.|$|E
25|$|Icebreakers {{were used}} on the canal, for instance, {{at the end of}} the boating season when winter froze the canal, so that the last group of boats <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> The {{icebreaker}} was typically a company scow filled with pig iron. Mules would pull the boat onto the ice, and the weight would break the ice. During the Civil war, the canal company attempted to keep the canal open during the winters of 1861-1862, despite the fact that winters were usually for repairs. Icebreaker boats were used to keep the channel free of ice, so that the military could move supplies.|$|E
25|$|After the United States entered World War I, Gates {{enlisted in}} the United States Navy in September 1917. He was mustered in as an ensign and {{assigned}} to the Pay Corps, which was responsible to managing the payroll of the navy. In December {{he was promoted to}} lieutenant and transferred overseas to work in the War Risk Insurance Bureau based in Ireland where he was employed to sell bonds to insure government war assets. He personally sold over $1 million in bonds, almost entirely to naval personal. In April 1919 he was transferred to France where he was placed in command of an airbase that was being constructed. The base was finished just as the war ended and Gates was offered a position in the Belgian relief effort, but he turned down the offer so he <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E

60|$|Captain Batsby {{effected}} {{his escape}} {{as quickly as}} he <b>could,</b> and <b>went</b> <b>home</b> a melancholy man. He, too, was aware that he was fixed; and, as he thought of this, a dreadful idea fell upon him that the Honourable Mr. Traffick had perhaps played him false.|$|R
25|$|As Minister of Works, Zhao Wenhua was {{responsible}} for constructions in the Forbidden Palace. He failed to finish a new storied building in the palace's western garden in time, yet the Jiajing Emperor saw Zhao Wenhua's new mansion being finished on the Chang'an Avenue across from the palace. An aide commented that the reason Zhao could not finish the building in the palace because he had diverted most of the timber to build his own mansion. The emperor was greatly displeased. Then, in May 1557, a fire burned down three palace halls, and the emperor ordered Zhao Wenhua to rebuild the tower on Zhengyangmen as soon as possible, but Zhao demurred. Around this time the emperor heard rumours that Zhao had taken bribes and exaggerated his victories in the south, and lost faith in the man entirely. Yan Song attempted to cover for Zhao Wenhua, {{saying that he had}} taken ill from his tour to the south. Zhao Wenhua followed up by asking for a short leave of absence for rest and recovery, upon which the emperor ordered the vice minister to take Zhao Wenhua's post so that Zhao <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> on September 13. Zhao was essentially sacked at this point.|$|E

Clarke sulked {{and walked over to}} warm up pitcher Addie Joss. On the first pitch, he stuck out a finger and the ball broke it cleanly. With blood {{streaming}} from his hand, Clarke waved it defiantly in front of Lajoie. [...] "Now can I go home?" [...] asked Clarke. He was out five weeks, and Cleveland lost the pennant to Detroit by half a game." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the General Assembly {{could act}} on his recommendations, Blackburn began {{granting}} pardons to relieve prison overcrowding. He particularly favored clemency for the incurably sick so they <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> {{to die with}} their families. During his term, Blackburn pardoned over one thousand individuals, earning him the nickname [...] "Lenient Luke". The pardons were extremely unpopular with {{both the public and}} the Democratic political establishment. Several newspapers claimed that Blackburn sold pardons for two dollars apiece, though no evidence exists to support such an accusation.|$|E

2500|$|A journalist, who {{had come}} to report another event that had been {{cancelled}} had wandered into the room, and wrote a brief report. This report was picked up by Die Suidwester, the National Party newspaper, and made front-page news, leading to a week of Anglican-bashing by that newspaper. Following that the Commissioner-General for Ovamboland, Jannie de Wet, said in a radio broadcast on Radio Ovambo that the contract labour system was not a form of slavery, because the workers <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> whenever they liked. A group in Walvis Bay, after hearing the broadcast, wrote to other contract workers all over the south of Namibia, suggesting that they should take [...] "the boer Jannie de Wet" [...] at his word, and all go home. The result was a highly successful contract workers strike, which signified a new mood of boldness following the decision of the World Court.|$|E

50|$|If I <b>Could</b> Just <b>Go</b> <b>Home</b> is {{the first}} album by country artist Ed Bruce, {{released}} in 1968. The album contains newly recorded songs, {{with the exception of}} five tracks that had previously been featured on single releases between 1966 and 1967. The album reached No. 44 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart.|$|R
50|$|On Friday, October 28, a woman {{claimed she}} had been sexually {{assaulted}} in her tent and robbed of $1800 cash. She said she <b>could</b> not <b>go</b> <b>home</b> because the attackers had taken her bills and knew where she lived. A 38-year-old man was taken into custody, though {{no evidence of a}} sexual assault was found.|$|R
2500|$|Thérèse {{was taught}} at home {{until she was}} eight and a half, and then entered the school kept by the Benedictine nuns of the Abbey of Notre Dame du Pre in Lisieux. Thérèse, taught well and {{carefully}} by Marie and Pauline, found herself {{at the top of}} the class, except for writing and arithmetic. However, because of her young age and high grades, she was bullied. The one who bullied her the most was a girl of fourteen who did poorly at school. Thérèse suffered very much as a result of her sensitivity, and she cried in silence. Furthermore, the boisterous games at recreation were not to her taste. She preferred to tell stories or look after the little ones in the infants class. [...] "The five years I spent at school were the saddest of my life, and if my dear Céline had not been with me I could not have stayed there for a single month without falling ill." [...] Céline informs us, [...] "She now developed a fondness for hiding, she did not want to be observed, for she sincerely considered herself inferior." [...] On her free days she became more and more attached to Marie Guérin, the younger of her two cousins in Lisieux. The two girls would play at being anchorites, as the great Teresa had once played with her brother. And every evening she plunged into the family circle. [...] "Fortunately I <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> every evening and then I cheered up. I used to jump on Father's knee and tell him what marks I had, and when he kissed me all my troubles were forgotten...I needed this sort of encouragement so much." [...] Yet the tension of the double life and the daily self-conquest placed a strain on Thérèse. Going to school became more and more difficult.|$|E
