5|$|On May16, the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) {{issued a}} {{forecast}} of a slightly below-average season. It predicted 10 named storms with a 70% <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> the number would be between 7 and 13 and 6 hurricanes with a 70% <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> the number would be between 3 and 9. It also predicted an ACE index of 84 with a 70% <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> the index {{would be in}} the range 47 to 121. NOAA released their pre-season forecasts on May22 and called for a 70% <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> there would be between 8 and 13 named storms, 3 to 6 hurricanes, and 1 to 2 major hurricanes. On May 29, the Florida State University Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies, FSU COAPS, issued its first and only prediction for the season. The organization called for five to nine named storms, of which two to six would further intensify into hurricanes; one to two of the hurricanes would reach major hurricane intensity. In addition, an ACE index of 60units was forecast.|$|E

5|$|On April10, Colorado State University (CSU) {{issued its}} first {{forecast}} for the season, {{calling for a}} potentially hyperactive season with 18named storms, nine hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 165. The probabilities of a major hurricane hitting the Gulf Coast and East Coast were well above average. On May15, the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) predicted 14named storms, with a 70% <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> the number would be between 10 and 18, and ninehurricanes with a 70% <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> the number would be between 4 and 14. It also predicted an ACE index of 130 with a 70% <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> the index {{would be in the}} range 76 to 184. On May 23, 2013, NOAA issued its first seasonal outlook for the year, stating there was a 70% likelihood of 13 to 20named storms, of which seven to eleven could become hurricanes, including three to six major hurricanes; these ranges are greater than the seasonal average of twelve named storms, six hurricanes and three major hurricanes. On May30, the Florida State University Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies, FSU COAPS, issued its first and only prediction for the season. The organization called for 12 to 17 named storms, of which five to ten would further intensify into hurricanes; no forecast was given for the number of major hurricanes. In addition, an ACE index of 135 units was forecast.|$|E

5|$|On May 27, NOAA {{issued its}} first outlook {{calling for a}} near-normal season with a 70% <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> 10–16 named storms could form, {{including}} 4–8 hurricanes of which 1–4 could reach major hurricane status. NOAA also stated {{that there is a}} 45% chance of a near-normal season, 30% chance of an above-normal season and 25% chance of a below-normal season. Also on May 27, TSR substantially increased their forecast numbers, predicting activity would be about 30% above the average with 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes and an ACE near 130. The reason for the increased activity forecast was the increased likelihood of La Niña forming during the season in addition to a trend towards a negative North Atlantic Oscillation, which generally favors a warmer tropical Atlantic. TSR predicted that there is a 57% <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> the 2016 Atlantic season would be above-normal, a 33% chance it would be near-normal, and only a 10% chance it would be below-normal.|$|E
5|$|On May21, the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) {{issued its}} forecast, {{predicting}} a season with below-normal activity. It predicted 8 storms, with a 70% <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> {{the number of}} storms would be between 6 and 10; it predicted 5 hurricanes, with a 70% <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> that number would fall {{in the range of}} 3 to 7. UKMO's ACE index prediction was 74 units, with a 70% chance of the index falling in the range of 40 to 108 units. On May27, NOAA released its seasonal forecast, predicting a below-normal season with 6 to 11 named storms, 3 to 6 hurricanes, and 0 to 2 major hurricanes. NOAA indicated that there was a 70% chance of a below-normal season, a 20% chance of a near-normal season, and a 10% chance of an above-normal season.|$|E

5|$|A {{breakthrough}} came in 1948 when {{a research}} group headed by John Enders at the Children's Hospital Boston successfully cultivated the poliovirus in human {{tissue in the}} laboratory. This group had recently successfully grown mumps in cell culture. In March 1948 Thomas H. Weller was attempting to grow varicella virus in embryonic lung tissue. He had inoculated the planned number of tubes when he noticed {{that there were a}} few unused tubes. He retrieved a sample of mouse brain infected with polio virus and added it to the remaining test tubes, on the off <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> the virus might grow. The varicella cultures failed to grow but the polio cultures were successful.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of galaxies in the Universe are moving away from the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, is heading toward it at about 120km/s. In 4billion years, Andromeda and the Milky Way will collide, causing both to deform as tidal forces distort their outer arms into vast tidal tails. If this initial disruption occurs, astronomers calculate a 12% <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> the Solar System will be pulled outward into the Milky Way's tidal tail and a 3% <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> it will become gravitationally bound to Andromeda and thus a part of that galaxy. After a further series of glancing blows, during which the likelihood of the Solar System's ejection rises to 30%, the galaxies' supermassive black holes will merge. Eventually, in roughly 6billion years, the Milky Way and Andromeda will complete their merger into a giant elliptical galaxy. During the merger, if there is enough gas, the increased gravity will force the gas to the centre of the forming elliptical galaxy. This may lead to a short period of intensive star formation called a starburst. In addition, the infalling gas will feed the newly formed black hole, transforming it into an active galactic nucleus. The force of these interactions will likely push the Solar System into the new galaxy's outer halo, leaving it relatively unscathed by the radiation from these collisions.|$|E

5|$|Batesian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Henry W. Bates. When an edible prey animal comes to resemble, even slightly, a distasteful animal, natural selection favours those individuals that even very slightly better resemble the distasteful species. This is because {{even a small}} degree of protection reduces predation and increases the <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> an individual mimic will survive and reproduce. For example, many species of hoverfly are coloured black and yellow like bees, and are in consequence avoided by birds (and people).|$|E

5|$|Cavities are {{in great}} demand for nesting by other cavity nesters, so {{woodpeckers}} face {{competition for the}} nesting sites they excavate {{from the moment the}} hole becomes usable. This may come from other species of woodpecker, or other cavity nesting birds like swallows and starlings. Woodpeckers may aggressively harass potential competitors, and also use other strategies to reduce the chance of being usurped from their nesting site; for example the red-crowned woodpecker digs its nest in the underside of a small branch, which reduces the <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> a larger species will take it over and expand it.|$|E

5|$|Fonseca and the navy's {{high command}} {{were faced with}} two {{extremely}} unpalatable choices.

Worse, {{there was a significant}} <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> the remaining Brazilian ships, all of which were smaller and much older than the ships controlled by the mutineers, would lose if it came to open combat. But by folding and giving into the rebel's list of demands—that is, demands from the underclass and broadly black naval crews—the elites would suffer an incredible embarrassment.|$|E

5|$|In an aerotow a powered {{aircraft}} {{is attached}} to a glider with a tow rope. Single-engined light aircraft or motor gliders are commonly used. The tow-plane takes the glider to the height and location requested by the pilot where the glider pilot releases the tow-rope. A weak link is often fitted to the rope to ensure that any sudden loads do not damage the airframe of the tow-plane or the glider. Under extreme loads the weak link will fail before any part of the glider or plane fails. There is a remote <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> the weak link might break at low altitude, and so pilots plan for this eventuality before launching.|$|E
