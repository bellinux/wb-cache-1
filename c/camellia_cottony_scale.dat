40|$|At {{present the}} nigra scale, Parasaissetia nigra (Nietner) and the <b>cottony</b> <b>camellia</b> <b>scale</b> Pulvinaria floccifera (Westwood) (Hemiptera: Coccidae) {{are among the}} most {{important}} pests on guava and mango trees in Egypt. The present investigation was set up to study the effect of different compounds on P. floccifera and P. nigra on guava and mango trees, respectively. The results indicated that in the first season (2010), the treatment with different compounds (Biofly “Beauveria bassiana”, Neemazal “Azadirachta indica”, and Super Misrona oil) gave a moderate reduction of percent in the population of adult females and nymphs of P. nigra and P. floccifera respectively, as compared to Malathion and its mixture (“Super Misrona oil+Malathion”) which gave a higher reduction rate after the 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd weeks after spraying. Also, these compounds gave a moderate mortality to the parasitoids as compared to Malathion and its mixture (“Super Misrona oil+Malathion”) which gave higher toxicity after the 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd weeks after spraying. The data obtained in the second season (2011) were also similar to those obtained in the first season (2010). It can be concluded that treatment with Biofly, Neemazal and Super Misrona oil gave satisfactory control of different stages of P. nigra and P. floccifera and their parasitoids, Diversinervus elegans Silvestri, Metaphycus lounsburyi (Howard), Microterys flavus (Howard) and Coccophagus sp., Metaphycus zebratus Mercet, M. flavus, respectively, as compared to Malathion and its mixture “Super Misrona oil+Malathion”...|$|R

40|$|Aspidiotiphagus citrinus (Craw) is {{a solitary}} {{endoparasite}} of Unaspis yanonensis (Kuwana). Usually this parasite attacks larvae except the early first instar. There {{is a difference}} in the structure of scales between female and male larvae. For instance the first and second instar male larvae secrete coarse and fine <b>cottony</b> <b>scales</b> respectively, while females do not secrete <b>cottony</b> <b>scales.</b> To confirm the influence of the structure of scales on oviposition by the parasite, the author examined percentages of oviposition attempts, insertings with ovipositor and actual ovipositions to host-findings and the time required for ovipositional behaviour in female and male larvae of different developmental stages. These percentages and the time varied with the developmental stages. The percentage of actual ovipositions to host-findings in the second instar female larvae tended to be inverse relative to the time required for ovipositional behaviour. Such a relation suggests the possibility that thickness of scales is an important factor influencing oviposition. But the percentage of actual ovipositions to hostfindings in the early second instar female larvae was higher than in the late first instar female larvae {{in spite of the fact}} that there is no large difference in thickness of scales between them. This suggests hardness of scales is also an important factor influencing oviposition. Tapping and drilling with the ovipositor in male larvae were frequently disturbed by the secretion of cottony threads. Fine <b>cottony</b> <b>scales</b> secreted by the second instar male larvae had very large influence on oviposition. Thus, the early second instar female larvae were the most suitable for oviposition by the parasite. ハネケナガツヤコバチの産卵行動にヤノネカイガラムシ雌雄の介殻の構造がどのような影響をおよぼしているかを明らかにするため,雌雄の発育ステージ別に産卵試行率,産卵管挿入率,産卵成功率,産卵行動時間などを調べた. 1. ヤノネカイガラムシ雌は介殻上に繊維物質を分泌しないが,雄 1 令幼虫は毛状物質を,雄 2 令幼虫は綿状物質を分泌する. 雌の供試虫のうち,最も介殻の厚さが薄いのは 2 令前期で,以下 1 令後期, 2 令後期の順であった. 雄 1 令後期の介殻の厚さは雌 1 令後期とほぼ同じであった. 雄 2 令幼虫の介殻は雌のように肥大しない. 2. 産卵試行率,産卵管挿入率および産卵成功率はいずれも雌の方が雄よりも高く,産卵成功率は雌 2 令前期がその他の発育ステージに比べて明らかに高かった. 3. 産卵行動時間は雄の方が雌より幾分短かった. 産卵行動時間は雄 1 令後期が最も短かったが,雌 2 令前期との間には大差がなかった. みかけの産卵行動時間は実際の産卵行動時間との問に大差がなかった. 4. 介殻の厚さと固さが産卵の成否と産卵行動時間に影響をおよぼす. 雄の分泌する繊維物質は産卵行動時間を増大させるばかりでなく,産卵行動を阻止する効果が大きい...|$|R

25|$|The {{first major}} pest that {{attacked}} orange {{trees in the}} United States was the <b>cottony</b> cushion <b>scale</b> (Icerya purchasi), imported from Australia to California in 1868. Within 20 years, it wiped out the citrus orchards around Los Angeles, and limited orange growth throughout California. In 1888, the USDA sent Alfred Koebele to Australia to study this scale insect in its native habitat. He brought back with him specimens of Novius cardinalis, an Australian ladybird beetle, and within a decade the pest was controlled.|$|R
5|$|Biological control {{techniques}} {{as we know}} them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the USA, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites Tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight the grapevine phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid Cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the <b>cottony</b> cushion <b>scale,</b> Icerya purchasi. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, {{but by the end of}} 1889 the <b>cottony</b> cushion <b>scale</b> population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.|$|R
50|$|At his request, Koebele was {{transferred}} in 1885 to Alameda, California {{where he studied}} local insect pests and evaluated the effectiveness of various insecticides. At this time the California citrus industry was facing an economic crisis {{brought about by the}} <b>cottony</b> cushion <b>scale</b> (Icerya purchasi), an invasive insect that had established itself in California orchards several years earlier. Koebele was soon focused on this pest, working alongside another federal entomologist, Daniel William Coquillett, to find a remedy. Insecticides had little effect and growers resorted to pulling up infested trees and burning them.|$|R
50|$|Coquillett {{placed the}} vedalia beetles on an infested orange tree {{enclosed}} in a tent. In a few months, the beetles had multiplied prolifically and devoured the scale insects. When the tent was opened, the beetles spread to adjoining trees {{and soon the}} entire orchard was free of the <b>cottony</b> cushion <b>scale.</b> As word of the dramatic results spread, citrus growers from throughout the state came to gather the insects and release them into their orchards. The beetles spread rapidly and by 1890 California was almost entirely free of the pest.|$|R
50|$|Back in Washington, Riley {{had noted}} the curious fact that citrus trees in Australia were largely {{unaffected}} by the <b>cottony</b> cushion <b>scale</b> even though the insect was native to the region. He suspected that natural predators of the scale insects held them in check. In 1888 Riley sent Koebele to Australia to investigate. There he found two likely predators of the scale—a parasitic fly (Cryptochaetum iceryae) and the vedalia beetle (Rodolia cardinalis). Koebele captured hundreds of these insects and shipped them back to Coquillett in California for further evaluation.|$|R
5000|$|After {{experimenting with}} {{kerosene}} application, Maskell became {{an advocate of}} biological control of pests, which involves finding their natural predators. He helped Albert Koebele of the United States Department of Agriculture collect vedalia [...] "ladybird" [...] beetles (Rodolia cardinalis), a predator of <b>cottony</b> cushion <b>scale,</b> which had become a devastating pest of Californian citrus farms. In its native Australia this pest was kept in check (so F. S. Crawford found) by a dipterous fly Cryptochetum iceryae which injected its eggs into the scale insect, which was then devoured by the resultant larvae.|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from the}} generalist aphid and scale predators and {{incidental}} substances of botanical origin, many Coccinellidae do favour or even specialise in certain prey types. This makes {{some of them}} particularly valuable as agents in biological control programmes. Determination of specialisation {{need not be a}} trivial matter, though; for example the larva of the Vedalia ladybird Rodolia cardinalis is a specialist predator on a few species of Monophlebidae, in particular Icerya purchasi, which is the most notorious of the <b>cottony</b> cushion <b>scale</b> species. However, the adult R. cardinalis can subsist for some months on a wider range of insects plus some nectar.|$|R
50|$|Although {{many species}} of Hemiptera are {{significant}} pests of crops and garden plants, including {{many species of}} aphid and scale insects, other species are harmless. The damage done is often {{not so much the}} deprivation of the plant of its sap, but the fact that they transmit serious viral diseases between plants. They often produce copious amounts of honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mould. Significant pests include the <b>cottony</b> cushion <b>scale,</b> a pest of citrus fruit trees, the green peach aphid and other aphids which attack crops worldwide and transmit diseases, and jumping plant lice which are often host plant-specific and transmit diseases.|$|R
40|$|Organophosphate and {{carbamate}} insecticides {{have been used}} to treat citrus pest problems for more than 40 years. From 1990 to 1998, we documented California red scale and yellow scale resistance to these insecticides. Armored scale resistance is found on an estimated 40 % of 163, 000 acres of citrus in the San Joaquin Valley. Citrus growers have responded by either increasing their use of natural enemies, especially the parasitoid wasp Aphytis melinus, or by applying newly registered insect growth regulator or neonicotinoid insecticides. While the California red scale problem is, for the moment, greatly reduced, outbreaks of <b>cottony</b> cushion <b>scale</b> are occurring because the new insecticides are highly toxic to the predatory vedalia beetle...|$|R
5000|$|Biological {{control was}} {{initiated}} in South Africa {{at the turn}} of the century when <b>cottony</b> cushion <b>scale</b> in citrus orchards was brought under control. Originally identified in 1878 in New Zealand, it is now found worldwide in citrus orchards and is controlled by the ladybird beetle Rodolia cardinalis. Another successful program was the virtual eradication of Opuntia vulgaris by the use of cochineal insects in 1913. Control of the Eucalyptus snout beetle followed in 1925 with the introduction of the egg parasite Anaphes nitens, a wasp native to Australia. Integrated pest management saw a swing away from pest eradication to pest control with a goal of minimal harmful side effects, reduced environmental damage, little consumer risk and ecological sustainability.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of vedalia beetles to combat <b>cottony</b> cushion <b>scale</b> is generally {{recognized as the}} first instance of successful biological control. Koebele in particular was hailed as a hero and the growers association awarded him with a gold watch and diamond earrings for his wife. Riley felt that his own role in the success was overlooked and he complained publicly of the perceived slight. Nevertheless, the growers pressured Riley to send Koebele on another expedition in 1891 to collect additional predatory insects from New Zealand, Australia and other Pacific islands. The friction between Riley and the Californians continued and he eventually ordered Coquillet and Koeble back to Washington. Instead, Koebele elected to resign his post {{and go to work}} for the Hawaiian provisional government.|$|R
50|$|The Margarodidae {{or ground}} pearls (<b>cottony</b> cushion <b>scales,</b> giant coccids, giant scale insects) are {{a family of}} scale insects within the {{superfamily}} Coccoidea. Members of the family include the Polish cochineal and Armenian cochineal (genus Porphyrophora) and the original ground pearl genus, Margarodes. Beginning in 1880, a number of distinct subfamilies were recognized, with the giant coccis (the Monophlebidae) being the first. Although Maskell proposed a new family, many continued to regard the monophlebids as a mere subfamily for many years, and the Margarodidae classification continued to be polyphyletic through the 20th Century. Since then, taking the advice of Koteja several subfamilies and tribes have been elevated into their own families such as Matsucoccidae and Xylococcidae. The pared-down family of Margarodidae (Margarodidae sensu stricto or Margarodidae s. s.) is monophyletic.|$|R
