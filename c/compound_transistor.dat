These devices suffer from specific failure mechanisms, which {{are related to}} their limited maturity, {{with the exception of}} the GaAs MESFETs, which exhibit a stable technology and an assessed reliability. The metallizations employed in high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) already benefit from this assessment. However, HEMT are affected by concerns related to hot carriers and impact ionization. The trapping of carriers and the generation of defects in the different layers are responsible for the observed instabilities. The stability of the base dopant is the main reliability concern for heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs). Beryllium outdiffuses from the base into the emitter and causes device degradation. Carbon has a lower diffusivity, but is affected by the presence of hydrogen, which prompts gain variations. Finally the hot carriers reliability concern in SiGe HBTs is briefly reviewed.

40|$|Organic {{electronics}} {{constitute an}} innovative field, with interesting applications complementary to the silicon semiconductor technology. From a scientific perspective, there is large {{interest in the}} fundamental understanding of electrical transport in organic semiconductors. However, a well-developed microscopic description is still lacking, due to the complicated character of the many-body polaronic-type of charge carriers in molecular compounds. In this Thesis, we have experimentally studied the intrinsic charge transport properties of organic semiconductors by using organic single-crystal field-effect transistors. The electric field-effect has been frequently used to investigate thin films of organic <b>compounds.</b> Unfortunately, thin-film <b>transistors</b> are not suitable {{for the study of}} intrinsic electronic properties of organic conductors, because their characteristics are often strongly affected by imperfections of the film structure and by insufficient purity of organic materials.

40|$|Abstract—Aggressive {{transistor}} scaling {{continues to}} drive increasingly complex digital designs. The {{large number of}} transistors available today enables the development of chip multiprocessors that include many cores on one die communicating through an on-chip interconnect. As the number of cores increases, scalable communication platforms, such as networks-on-chip (NoCs), have become more popular. However, as the sole communication medium, these interconnects are a {{single point of failure}} so that any permanent fault in the NoC can cause the entire system to fail. <b>Compounding</b> the problem, <b>transistors</b> have become increasingly susceptible to wear-out related failures as their critical dimensions shrink. As a result, the on-chip network has become a critically exposed unit that must be protected. To this end, we present Vicis, a fault-tolerant architecture and companion routing protocol that is robust to a large number of permanent failures, allowing communication to continue in the face of permanent transistor failures. Vicis makes use of a two-level approach. First, it attempts to work around errors within a router by leveraging reconfigurable architectural components. Second, when faults within a router disable a link’s connectivity, or even an entire router, Vicis reroutes around the faulty node or link with a novel, distributed routing algorithm for meshes and tori. Tolerating permanent faults in both the router components and the reliability hardware itself, Vicis enables graceful performance degradation of networks-on-chip.

40|$|There is a {{compelling}} need to explore different material options as well as device structures to facilitate smooth transistor scaling for higher speed, higher density and lower power. The enormous potential of nanoelectronics, and nanotechnology in general, offers us the possibility of designing devices with added functionality. However, at the same time, the new materials come with their own challenges {{that need to be}} overcome. In this work, we have addressed some of these challenges in the context of quasi- 2 D Silicon, III-V semiconductor and graphene. Bulk Si is the most widely used semiconductor with an indirect bandgap of about 1. 1 eV. However, when Si is thinned down to sub- 10 nm regime, the quasi- 2 D nature of the system changes the electronic properties of the material significantly due to the strong geometrical confinement. Using a tight-binding study, we show that in addition to the increase in bandgap due to quantization, it is possible to transform the original in direct bandgap to a direct one. The effective masses at different valleys are also shown to vary uniquely in an anisotropic way. This ultra-thin Si, when used as a channel in a double gate MOSFET structure, creates so called “volume in version” which is extensively investigated in this work. It has been found that the both the quantum confinement as well as the gating effect {{play a significant role in}} determining the spatial distribution of the charge, which in turn has an important role in the characteristics of <b>transistor.</b> <b>Compound</b> III-V semiconductors, like Inx Ga 1 -xAs, provide low effective mass and low density of states. This, when coupled with strong confinement in a nanowire channel transistor, leads to the “Ultimate Quantum Capacitance Limit” (UQCL) regime of operation, where only the lowest subband is occupied. In this regime, the channel capacitance is much smaller than the oxide capacitance and hence dominates in the total gate capacitance. It is found that the gate capacitance change qualitatively in the UQCL regime, allowing multi-peak, non-monotonic capacitance-voltage characteristics. It is also shown that in an ideal condition, UQCL provides improved current saturation, on-off ratio and energy-delay product, but a degraded intrinsic gate delay. UQCL shows better immunity towards series resistance effect due to increased channel resistance, but is more prone to interfacial traps. A careful design can provide a better on-off ratio at a given gate delay in UQCL compared to conventional MOSFET scenario. To achieve the full advantages of both FinFET and HEMT in III-V domain, a hybrid structure, called “HFinFET” is proposed which provides excellent on performance like HEMT with good gate control like FinFET. During on state, the carriers in the channel are provided using a delta-doped layer(like HEMT) from the top of a fin-like non-planar channel, and during off state, the gates along the side of the fin(like FinFET) help to pull-off the carriers from the channel. Using an effective mass based coupled Poisson-Schrodinger simulation, the proposed structure is found to outperform the state of the art planar and non-planar MOSFETs. By careful optimization of the gate to source-drain underlap, it is shown that the design window of the device can be increased to meet ITRS projections at similar gate length. In addition, the performance degradation of HFinFET in presence of interface traps has been found to be significantly mitigated by tuning the underlap parameter. Graphene is a popular 2 D hexagonal carbon crystal with extraordinary electronic, mechani-cal and chemical properties. However, the zero band gap of grapheme has limited its application in digital electronics. One could create a bandgap in grapheme by making quasi- 1 D strips, called nanoribbon. However, the bandgap of these nanoribbons depends on the the type of the edge, depending on which, one can obtain either semiconducting or metallic nanoribbon. It has been shown that by the application of an external transverse ﬁeld along the sides of a nanoribbon, one could not only modulate the magnitude of the bandgap, but also change it from direct to indirect. This could open up interesting possibilities for novel electronic and optoelectronic applications. The asymmetric potential distribution inside the nanoribbon is found to result in such direct to indirect bandgap transition. The corresponding carrier masses are also found to be modulated by the external ﬁeld, following a transition from a“slow”electron to a“fast” electron and vice-versa. Experimentally, it is difficult to control the bandgap in nanoribbons as precise edge control at nanometer scale is nontrivial. One could also open a bandgap in a bilayer graphene, by the application of vertical electric field, which has raised a lot of interest for digital applications. Using a self-consistent tight binding theory, it is found that, inspite of this bandgap opening, the intrinsic bias dependent electronic structure and the screening effect limit the subthreshold slope of a metal source drain bilayer grapheme transistor at a relatively higher value-much above the Boltzmann limit. This in turn reduces the on-off ratio of the transistor significantly. To overcome this poor on-off ratio problem, a semiconductor source-drain structure has been proposed, where the minority carrier injection from the drain is largely switched off due to the bandgap of the drain. Using a self-consistent Non-Equilibrium Green’s Function(NEGF) approach, the proposed device is found to be extremely promising providing unipolar grapheme devices with large on-oﬀ ratio, improved subthreshold slope and better current saturation. At high drain bias, the transport properties of grapheme is extremely intriguing with a number of nontrivial effects. Optical phonons in monolayer grapheme couple with carriers in a much stronger way as compared to a bilayer due to selection rules. However, it is difficult to experimentally probe this through transport measurements in substrate supported grapheme as the surface polar phonons with typical low activation energy dominates the total scattering. However, at large drain field, the carriers obtain sufficient energy to interact with the optical phonons, and create so called ‘hot phonons’ which we have experimentally found to result in a negative differential conductance(NDC). The magnitude of this NDC is found to be much stronger in monolayer than in bilayer, which agrees with theoretical calculations. This NDC has also been shown to be compensated by extra minority carrier injection from drain at large bias resulting in an excellent current saturation through a fundamentally different mechanism as compared to velocity saturation. A transport model has been proposed based on the theory, and the experimental observations are found to be in agreement with the model...|$|R
