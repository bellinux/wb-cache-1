5|$|Titian was a {{personal}} friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death. Ottavio excelled as a military commander and was awarded the Golden Fleece by the emperor. While the post had been given {{as a means to}} strengthen the family position, it did not <b>come</b> <b>without</b> cost. His success bred resentment amongst his family, as he began to see himself unaccountable to Rome.|$|E

25|$|These two factors, {{coupled with}} {{exceptional}} eyesight, were {{the keys to}} Beurling's later success. But they did not <b>come</b> <b>without</b> effort. At Hawarden, he immersed himself in gunnery, estimation of range, deflection, bullet trail and bullet drop, imprinting them into his subconscious until they were automatic. For him, flying and shooting became one single action.|$|E
25|$|The Greek {{forms of}} the Doric order <b>come</b> <b>without</b> an {{individual}} base. They instead are placed directly on the stylobate. Later forms, however, came with the conventional base consisting of a plinth and a torus. The Roman versions of the Doric order have smaller proportions. As a result, they appear lighter than the Greek orders.|$|E

25|$|The changes did not <b>come</b> <b>without</b> cost. Dissident locals, {{including}} {{large ones}} in Atlanta, Georgia, and San Francisco, California, were trusteed on (allegedly) thin evidence. In 2001, carpenters in the British Columbia Provincial Council of Carpenters voted to disaffiliate {{from the international}} union in protest against McCarron's actions. McCarron called the council communist-dominated and argued it had lost too much market share to survive. By 1999, angry union members had formed Carpenters for a Democratic Union to challenge McCarron's actions and unseat him as president.|$|E
25|$|Such {{growth has}} not <b>come</b> <b>without</b> difficulties. There are {{questions}} {{as to how much}} more passenger growth can occur. The airport's present terminal and runway layout are reaching full utilization and PHL remains the world's largest airport without an inground fueling system thus requiring fuel to be trucked to each airplane. These two factors have led to congestion and delays. Additionally, the airport's parking facilities have been severely taxed. Exhaustion of all 17,000 parking spaces at the airport has become a regular occurrence. However, airport officials have ambitious plans for terminal and runway expansion.|$|E

These great accomplishments did not <b>come</b> <b>without</b> a price. In four months of flying. CVG-11 lost over 50 aircraft and had more than 60 men killed, missing-in-action or wounded. Air Group Eleven was replaced by Air Group Seventeen on 1 February 1945. They arrived back in Alameda on 24 February 1945. For these operations, CVG-11 was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E

The event does not <b>come</b> <b>without</b> protest, where Pagans gather in an attempt to stop the proceedings.

The move didn't <b>come</b> <b>without</b> controversy, {{as it was reported}} that Kidd had been seeking more management power over the Nets GM Billy King and after being denied began talks with the Bucks even though they still had a coach under contract in Larry Drew. He later stated that he felt the Nets truly did not want him nor were they committed to building a contender. In his return to Brooklyn on November 19, 2014, he was greeted with heavy boos and jeers.|$|E

25|$|The Speaker {{also called}} on unions to make {{contributions}} {{to help in}} the Detroit settlement. Bolger requested unions to make a material contribution that is reflective of other parties involved in the settlement. Bolger's request did not <b>come</b> <b>without</b> opposition, the Detroit Free Press issued an editorial claiming Governor Rick Snyder should convince Speaker Bolger to drop his demand or go around Bolger. The Detroit News editorialized that the union contribution demand was too much, and the likelihood of unions contributing would be slim. Other critics wrote that Bolger's demand would imperil the settlement. Bolger did receive support from conservative columnists and was urged to continue his demand. Bolger held firm to his request, and unions - the first was The Michigan Building and Construction Trades Council - did agree to make material contributions towards health care costs to help with the Detroit bankruptcy settlement. After unions agreed to contribution money towards the settlement, the Michigan House passed legislation with major bipartisan support.|$|E
25|$|Al Capone was {{the most}} notorious gangster of his generation. Born on January 17, 1899 in Brooklyn, New York; Capone settled in Chicago to take over Johnny Torrio's {{business}} dealing with outlawed liquor. Within three years, Capone had nearly 700 men at his disposal. As the profits came in, Capone acquired finesse—particularly {{in the management of}} politicians. By the middle of the decade, he had gained control of the suburb of Cicero, and had installed his own mayor. Capone's rise to fame did not <b>come</b> <b>without</b> bloodshed. Rival gangs, such as the Gennas and the Aiellos, started wars with Capone, eventually leading to a rash of killings. In 1927, Capone and his gang were pulling in approximately $60 million per year—most of it from beer. Capone not only controlled the sale of liquor to over 10,000 speakeasies, but he also controlled the supply from Canada to Florida. Capone was imprisoned in 1929 for tax violations and died January 25, 1947, from a heart attack, pneumonia, and syphilis.|$|E
25|$|David II's {{liberation from}} hostage in 1357 did not <b>come</b> <b>without</b> conditions, {{one of which}} was that Edward would hold on to the lands in the {{southeast}} of the country; this ensured that Dryburgh and the other border abbeys stayed in English held territory. David allowed the abbeys to keep their Scottish possessions and did not interfere with the canons and monks from receiving the income from those. Dryburgh's records had all been lost at this time and it is only from what is known at Melrose that Dryburgh's position can be traced. The wool export trade and the resultant customs duty was important to David and so the Border abbeys who produced large amounts of wool were encouraged to use the Scottish ports and at the expense of Edward's Berwick. The 1360s and 1370s saw the English hold over the Border areas diminish until it was basically the castles at Berwick, Jedburgh and Roxburgh with the county of Berwick and {{the eastern part of the}} county of Roxburgh still in their grip. Pressure on these bastions intensified during 1384 and 1385 and Scottish raiding parties moved deep into England forcing Richard II to launch his army on a hugely damaging incursion through the Borders to Edinburgh which he burned. On the way he ordered the sacking of Dryburgh, Melrose and Newbattle. It was while Richard was in Newbattle Wood in August 1385 that he took reprisals against all those in Teviotdale who had returned to the Scottish cause.|$|E

25|$|The team limped home on August 2 to open {{a four-game}} home stand against the Padres. In the opener, Hiroki Kuroda {{struggled}} as the Dodgers losing streak hit six with a 10–5 loss. Matt Kemp had four hits in four at-bats in the game. The Dodgers finally snapped the losing streak the next night as Ted Lilly made an impressive Dodgers debut. Lilly retired 20 straight after allowing a 1st-inning home run to Miguel Tejada. A two-run double by Russell Martin in the 2nd inning was all the offense the Dodgers could muster {{but it was enough}} to pick up a 2–1 victory. The victory did not <b>come</b> <b>without</b> a cost however, as Martin suffered a season-ending injury when he tore the labrum in his right knee during a collision at home plate. With backup catcher Brad Ausmus in the lineup, the Dodgers picked up a 9–0 victory on August 4. Vicente Padilla took a no-hitter into the seventh inning and pitched a complete game, two-hit shutout. The following day, the offense once more went into hibernation as the Dodgers dropped the series finale, 5–0. In the opener of a three-game series against the Washington Nationals, Kershaw struck out nine but allowed two three-run homers to Adam Dunn and the Dodgers lost 6–3. The Dodgers won the following day, on a walk-off single by James Loney in the 10th for a 3–2 victory. The Dodgers concluded the home stand with an 8–3 Sunday afternoon win over the Nationals, handing Ted Lilly his second victory since joining the Dodgers.|$|E
