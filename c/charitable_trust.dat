5|$|Charitable trusts in English law are {{a form of}} {{express trust}} {{dedicated}} to charitable goals. There {{are a variety of}} advantages to <b>charitable</b> <b>trust</b> status, including exception from most forms of tax and freedom for the trustees not found in other types of English trust. To be a valid <b>charitable</b> <b>trust,</b> the organisation must demonstrate both a charitable purpose and a public benefit. Applicable charitable purposes are normally divided into categories for public benefit including the relief of poverty, the promotion of education, the advancement of health and saving of lives, promotion of religion and all other types of trust recognised by the law. There is also a requirement that the trust's purposes benefit the public (or some section of the public), and not simply a group of private individuals.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{advantages}} to charity status. Within English trusts law, a standard express trust has a relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries; this does not apply to charitable trusts, partially because of the special definition of trustee used and partially because there are no individual beneficiaries identified in a <b>charitable</b> <b>trust.</b> Instead, the Attorney General of England and Wales sues on behalf of beneficiaries to enforce a <b>charitable</b> <b>trust.</b> Because of this lack of a relationship, the trustees' powers are far wider-ranging, only being regulated by the Charity Commission and actions brought by the Attorney General; the beneficiaries have no direct control. Charitable trusts are also exempt from many formalities when being created, including the rule against perpetuities. The trustees are also not required to act unanimously, only with a majority.|$|E

5|$|The state {{took over}} the {{management}} of the property in 1950, but by the 1980s the visitor facilities were felt to be unsuitable, leading to a three-way partnership being created between the local council, the state agency English Heritage and a local <b>charitable</b> <b>trust</b> to develop the castle. The keep was re-roofed and re-floored in the 1990s with the help of European Union funding.

5|$|As {{a form of}} express trust, {{charitable}} trusts {{are subject}} to certain formalities, {{as well as the}} requirements of the three certainties, when being created. These vary depending on whether the gift that creates the trust is given in life, given after death, or includes land. If the gift is given after death through a will, the will must comply with Section 9 of the Wills Act 1837, which requires that the will be in writing and signed by the testator (or somebody else present, at the testator's instruction), {{it is clear that the}} testator intended to give effect to the will, and the signature is made or noted by two or more witnesses. If these are all carried out, the will is a valid document, and the gift made as part of it can create a <b>charitable</b> <b>trust.</b> If the gift is of land and made during the donor's lifetime, it must comply with Section 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, which requires that the agreement be a written document signed by the person giving it. If the gift is of personal property and made inter vivos, there are no formal requirements; it is enough that an oral declaration is made creating the trust. Once constituted properly, a <b>charitable</b> <b>trust,</b> like all express trusts, cannot be undone unless there is something allowing that within the trust instrument.|$|E
5|$|Oil and gas {{were first}} landed in 1978 at Sullom Voe, which has {{subsequently}} {{become one of}} the largest terminals in Europe. Taxes from the oil have increased public sector spending on social welfare, art, sport, environmental measures and financial development. Three quarters of the islands' workforce is employed in the service sector, and the Shetland Islands Council alone accounted for 27.9% of output in 2003. Shetland's access to oil revenues has funded the Shetland <b>Charitable</b> <b>Trust,</b> which in turn funds a wide variety of local programmes. The balance of the fund in 2011 was £217 million, i.e., about £9,500 per head.|$|E
