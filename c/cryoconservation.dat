25|$|Another {{beneficial}} {{factor in}} <b>cryoconservation</b> of indigenous livestock is {{in terms of}} food security and economic development. Indigenous livestock often have beneficial traits related to adaptation to local climate and diseases that can be incorporated into major breeds through <b>cryoconservation</b> practices. <b>Cryoconservation</b> is a favorable strategy because it allows germplasms to be stored for extended periods of time in a small confined area. An additional benefit of <b>cryoconservation</b> is the ability to preserve the biological material of both maternal and paternal cells and maintain viability over extended periods of time. <b>Cryoconservation</b> has been successfully used as a conservation strategy for species and breeds that have since been endangered. One drawback is that <b>cryoconservation</b> can only be done if preparation has taken place in advance. With proper preparation of collecting and maintaining genetic material, this method is very beneficial for the conservation of rare and endangered livestock. <b>Cryoconservation</b> can serve as a contingency plan when a breed population needs to be restored or when a breed has become extinct, as well as for breed improvement. This process benefits companies and researchers by making genetic materials available.|$|E
25|$|Individual Livestock Keepers and Breed Associations-individual {{livestock}} keepers {{are commonly}} the primary {{owners of the}} livestock whose germplasm is used for processes of <b>cryoconservation.</b> Breed Associations {{would be interested in}} the well-being of their respective breeds in short and long terms. Through this interest these associations may provide financial and organizational support for the <b>cryoconservation</b> process.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cryoconservation</b> {{is limited}} by the cells and tissues that can be frozen and {{successfully}} thawed. Cells and tissues that can be successfully frozen are limited by their surface area. To keep cells and tissues viable, they must be frozen quickly to prevent ice crystal formation. Thus, a large surface area is beneficial. Another limitation is the species being preserved. There have been difficulties using particular methods of <b>cryoconservation</b> with certain species. For example, artificial insemination is more difficult in sheep than cattle, goats, pigs, or horses due to posterior folds in the cervix of ovines. Cryopreservation of embryos is dependent on the species and the stage of development of the embryo. Pig embryos are the most difficult to freeze, thaw, and utilize produce live offspring due to their sensitivity to chilling and high lipid content.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryoconservation</b> is {{the process}} of {{freezing}} cells and tissues using liquid nitrogen to achieve extreme low temperatures with the intent of using the preserved sample to prevent the loss of genetic diversity. Semen, embryos, oocytes, somatic cells, nuclear DNA, and other types of biomaterial such as blood and serum can be stored using cryopreservation, in order to preserve genetic materials. The primary benefit of <b>cryoconservation</b> is the ability to save germplasms for extended periods of time, therefore maintaining the genetic diversity of a species or breed. There are two common techniques of cryopreservation: slow freezing and vitrification. Slow freezing helps eliminate the risk of intracellular ice crystals. If ice crystals form in the cells, there can be damage or destruction of genetic material. Vitrification {{is the process}} of freezing without the formation of ice crystals.|$|E

25|$|Many anti-GMO activists {{argue that}} the use of GM crops {{decreases}} biodiversity amongst plants.

25|$|<b>Cryoconservation</b> is an {{indispensable}} {{tool in the}} storage of genetic material of animal origin {{and will continue to}} be useful for the conservation of livestock into the future. <b>Cryoconservation</b> serves as a way to preserve germplasms, which is particularly beneficial for threatened breeds. Indigenous livestock may be conserved for a variety of reasons, including the preservation of local genetics, their importance in local traditions and their value to the culture identity and heritage of the area. The loss of regional livestock diversity could increase instability, decreases future possibilities and challenge production systems. Moreover, the maintenance of indigenous breeds can aid in the preservation of traditional lifestyles and livelihoods, even providing income through cultural tourism. Indigenous breeds can contribute to local economies and production systems by utilising land that is unsuitable for crop production to produce food products, as well as providing hides, manure and draft power. Therefore, the conservation and progression of these breeds are of the utmost importance for food security and sustainability.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the use of <b>cryoconservation</b> to prevent the {{extinction}} of a livestock breed is the case of the Hungarian Grey cattle, or Magya Szurke. Hungarian Grey cattle were once a dominant breed in southeastern Europe with a population of 4.9million head in 1884. They were mainly used for draft power and meat. However, the population had decreased to 280,000 head by the end of World War II and eventually reached the low population of 187 females and 6 males from 1965 to 1970. The breed's decreased use was due primarily to the mechanization of agriculture and the adoption of major breeds, which yield higher milk production. The Hungarian government launched a project to preserve the breed, as it possesses valuable traits, such as stamina, calving ease, disease resistance, and easy adaptation to a variety of climates. The government program included various conservation strategies, including the cryopreservation of semen and embryos. The Hungarian government's conservation effort brought the population up to 10,310 in 2012, which shows significant improvement using <b>cryoconservation.</b>|$|E
25|$|FAO has a unit {{focused on}} Animal Genetic Resources, which {{are defined as}} “those animal species that are used, or may be used, for the {{production}} of food and agriculture, and the populations within each of them. These populations within each species can be classified as wild and feral populations, landraces and primary populations, standardised breeds, selected lines, varieties, strains and any conserved genetic material; all of which are currently categorized as Breeds.". FAO assists countries in implementation of the Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources. FAO supports a variety of ‘ex situ’ and ‘in situ’ conservation strategies including <b>cryoconservation</b> of animal genetic resources.|$|E
25|$|The second {{technique}} for <b>cryoconservation</b> is vitrification or flash freezing. Vitrification is the transformation from a liquid to solid state without {{the formation of}} crystals. The process and mechanics of vitrification are similar to slow freezing, the difference lying in the concentration of the medium. The vitrification method applies a selected medium which has a higher concentration of solute so the water will leave the cells via osmosis. The medium is concentrated enough so all of the intracellular water will leave without the medium needing to be reconcentrated. The higher concentration of the medium in vitrification allows the germplasms to be frozen more rapidly than with slow freezing. Vitrification {{is considered to be}} the more effective technique of freezing germplasms.|$|E
25|$|The Gaur {{population}} {{experienced a}} drastic decline of about 90% between the 1960s and 1990s due to poaching, commercial hunting, shrinking habitat, and the spreading of disease. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, the Gaur is a vulnerable species {{due to its}} declining population in Southeast Asia. Although the global Gaur population has declined by 30% over the past 30 years, the Gaur has a relatively stable population in India, due to protective efforts such as <b>cryoconservation.</b> The American Association of Zoos and Aquariums, Integrated Conservation Research (ICR), and Advanced Cell Technology have made efforts to use cryopreserved specimens of the Gaur through artificial insemination, embryo transfer, and cloning, respectively. Hybridization with domestic cattle has been successfully achieved by ICR, {{in order to create}} higher yielding, heat resistant cattle.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Cryoconservation</b> {{of animal}} genetic {{resources}} is a strategy wherein samples of animal genetic materials are preserved cryogenically. Animal genetic resources, {{as defined by the}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, are [...] "those animal species that are used, or may be used, for the production of food and agriculture, and the populations within each of them. These populations within each species can be classified as wild and feral populations, landraces and primary populations, standardised breeds, selected lines, varieties, strains and any conserved genetic material; all of which are currently categorized as Breeds." [...] Genetic materials that are typically cryogenically preserved include sperm, oocytes, embryos and somatic cells. Cryogenic facilities are called gene banks and can vary greatly in size usually according to the economic resources available. They must be able to facilitate germplasm collection, processing, freezing, and long term storage, all in a hygienic and organized manner. Gene banks must maintain a precise database and make information and genetic resources accessible to properly facilitate <b>cryoconservation.</b> <b>Cryoconservation</b> is an ex situ conservation strategy that often coexists alongside in situ conservation to protect and preserve livestock genetics. <b>Cryoconservation</b> of livestock genetic resources is primarily done in order to preserve the genetics of populations of interest, such as indigenous breeds, also known as local or minor breeds. Material may be stored because individuals shared specific genes and phenotypes that may be of value or have potential value for researchers or breeders. Therefore, one of the main goals remains preserving the gene pool of local breeds that may be threatened. Indigenous livestock genetics are commonly threatened by factors such as globalization, modernization, changes in production systems, inappropriate introduction of major breeds, genetic drift, inbreeding, crossbreeding, climate change, natural disasters, disease, cultural changes, and urbanization. Indigenous livestock are critical to sustainable agricultural development and food security, due to their: adaptation to environment and endemic diseases, indispensable part in local production systems, social and cultural significance, and importance to local rural economies. The genetic resources of minor breeds have value to the local farmers, consumers of the products, private companies and investors interested in crossbreeding, breed associations, governments, those conducting research and development, and non-governmental organizations. Therefore, efforts have been made by national governments and non-governmental organizations, such as the Livestock Conservancy, to encourage conservation of livestock genetics through <b>cryoconservation,</b> as well as through other ex situ and in situ strategies. Cryogenic specimens of livestock genetic resources can be preserved and used for extended periods of time. This advantage makes <b>cryoconservation</b> beneficial particularly for threatened breeds who have low breed populations. Cryogenically preserved specimens can be used to revive breeds that are endangered or extinct, for breed improvement, crossbreeding, research and development. However, <b>cryoconservation</b> can be an expensive strategy and requires long term hygienic and economic commitment for germplasms to remain viable. <b>Cryoconservation</b> can also face unique challenges based on the species, as some species have a reduced survival rate of frozen germplasm.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of today’s {{significantly}} improved prognosis for patients with cancer, {{quality of life is}} increasingly important after overcoming treatment of the disease. Fears about fertility preservation play an important role for young men and women. The most common types of cancer diagnosed under the age of 40 years are breast cancer, melanoma, cervical cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and leukaemia. One of the biggest problems in women who have to undergo chemo- or radiotherapy is premature ovarian failure (premature ovarian insufficiency) and its associated infertility. For breast cancer alone, it is assumed that there are ca. 200 patients a year in Germany who wish to conceive. In men, chemotherapy can result in permanent damage to the testicular tissue. Due to advances in reproductive medicine, a variety of fertility-protective methods are now available. These techniques include administration of GnRH-agonists, ovarian stimulation with <b>cryoconservation</b> of fertilised or unfertilised oocytes, as well as <b>cryoconservation</b> of ovarian tissue. Relocation of the ovaries by surgically moving them out of the pelvis (ovarian transposition) to protect them from damage caused by radiotherapy is also possible.|$|E
