500|$|During season five, a young Charlotte Lewis {{is shown}} {{living with her}} parents {{as part of a}} {{scientific}} community known as the Dharma Initiative, on the island where Oceanic Flight 815 would later crash. She is confronted by an adult Daniel Faraday, who attempts to persuade her never to return to the island once she leaves, and is seen evacuating the island during the fifth season finale [...] "The Incident". Charlotte grows up in Bromsgrove, unaware of where she was born, and goes on to study at the University of Kent for her undergraduate degree. She earns a doctoral degree in cultural anthropology from the University of Oxford, with her interest in anthropology stemming from a desire to find her birthplace. While visiting an excavation site in the Sahara Desert, Charlotte discovers the remains of a polar bear, which has a <b>collar</b> <b>bearing</b> a Dharma Initiative logo. Businessman Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) selects Charlotte along with Daniel Faraday, Miles Straume (Ken Leung), and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), to travel on a freighter to the island where she was born, and find Widmore's rival Ben Linus (Michael Emerson). She is forced to eject from a helicopter during a lightning storm over the island.|$|E

60|$|Their {{contented}} {{manner of}} making {{the best of the}} things around them, I found so pleasantly inseparable from their usefulness! Their pride in this partition that we put up ourselves, or in that partition that we took down, or in that other partition that we moved, or in the stove that was given us for the waiting-room, or in our nightly conversion of the little consulting-room into a smoking-room! Their admiration of the situation, if we could only get rid of its one objectionable incident, the coal-yard at the back! 'Our hospital carriage, presented by a friend, and very useful.' That was my presentation to a perambulator, for which a coach-house had been discovered in a corner down-stairs, just large enough to hold it. Coloured prints, in all stages of preparation for being added to those already decorating the wards, were plentiful; a charming wooden phenomenon of a bird, with an impossible top-knot, who ducked his head when you set a counter weight going, had been inaugurated as a public statue that very morning; and trotting about among the beds, on familiar terms with all the patients, was a comical mongrel dog, called Poodles. This comical dog (quite a tonic in himself) was found characteristically starving {{at the door of the}} institution, and was taken in and fed, and has lived here ever since. An admirer of his mental endowments has presented him with a <b>collar</b> <b>bearing</b> the legend, 'Judge not Poodles by external appearances.' He was merrily wagging his tail on a boy's pillow when he made this modest appeal to me.|$|E
50|$|Locking {{the output}} shaft with a gear is {{achieved}} {{by means of a}} dog clutch selector. The dog clutch is a sliding selector mechanism which is splined to the output shaft, meaning that its hub has teeth that fit into slots (splines) on the shaft, forcing that shaft to rotate with it. However, the splines allow the selector to move {{back and forth on the}} shaft, which happens when it is pushed by a selector fork that is linked to the gear lever. The fork does not rotate, so it is attached to a <b>collar</b> <b>bearing</b> on the selector. The selector is typically symmetric: it slides between two gears and has a synchromesh and teeth on each side in order to lock either gear to the shaft.|$|E

50|$|The {{supporters}} {{are derived from}} the arms of Lincoln's Inn and Gray's Inn, both situated in the borough; the lion is originally for the De Lacy family, Earls of Lincoln, whose London home became Lincoln's Inn, while the griffin stands for Gray's Inn. The {{supporters are}} both differenced by a <b>collar</b> <b>bearing</b> three mullets and hanging from each is a heraldic fountain (which should be depicted in silver and blue since no other tinctures are specified {{for them in the}} blazon, not silver and black as they are wrongly depicted here). The three mullets of each collar symbolise the three boroughs merged to form Camden while their total number, six, represent the number of old parishes in Camden. The fountains reflects the name of Holborn, originally 'old bourne' or may represent the canals and waterways of the borough.|$|E

Its obverse bears the effigy {{of the republic}} {{in the form of}} the relief image of the left profile of a woman wearing a firefighter's helmet, also visible is her uniform <b>collar</b> <b>bearing</b> the distinctive grenade insignia of the firefighting corps in France. On either side, the relief inscription along the circumference [...] "RÉPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE" [...] ("FRENCH REPUBLIC"). The medal is struck in silver, silver-gilt and gold. The silver grade award's ribbon suspension bar is adorned with opposing fire hose nozzles. Each grade above silver is denoted by an increasingly intricate ornamentation on the ribbon suspension bar. For the silver-gilt variant, this consists of crossed firemen's axes superimposed over part of a ladder below horizontal fire hose nozzles. The gold variant replaces the nozzles with a laurel wreath.|$|E

40|$|A gas {{lubricated}} {{thrust bearing}} is described which employs relatively rigid inwardly cantilevered spokes carrying a relatively resilient annular member or annulus. This annulus {{acts as a}} beam on which are mounted bearing pads. The resilience of the beam mount causes the pads to accept the load and, with proper design, responds to a rotating thrust-transmitting collar by creating a gas film between the pads and the thrust <b>collar.</b> The <b>bearing</b> may be arranged for load equalization thereby avoiding the necessity of gimbal mounts or the like for the bearing. It may also be arranged to respond to rotation in one or both directions...|$|R

5000|$|Uniforms of the Heer as {{the ground}} forces of the Wehrmacht were {{distinguished}} from other branches by two devices: the army form of the Wehrmachtsadler or Hoheitszeichen (national emblem) worn above the right breast pocket, and - with certain exceptions - <b>collar</b> tabs <b>bearing</b> a pair of Litzen (Doppellitze [...] "double braid"), a device inherited from the old Prussian Guard which resembled a Roman numeral II on its side. Both eagle and Litzen were machine-embroidered or woven in white or grey (hand-embroidered in silk, silver or aluminium for officers). Rank was worn on shoulder-straps except for junior enlisted (Mannschaften), who wore plain shoulder-straps and their rank insignia, if any, on the left upper sleeve. NCO's wore a 9mm silver or grey braid around the collar edge.|$|R
5|$|The divisional {{insignia}} was a {{sun with}} 16 rays, the ancient {{symbol of the}} Macedonian king Alexander the Great. A divisional <b>collar</b> patch <b>bearing</b> the insignia was intended, but it is unlikely it was ever issued. During their formation and training in the Bácska region {{during the summer of}} 1944, the soldiers often dressed in khaki tropical uniforms with shorts. The official headgear of the division was the SS M43 fez: a field gray model to be worn with service uniform and a red model for dress uniform. Members of the division that had previously served in the 13th SS Division often continued to wear the divisional collar patch of that division, which showed an arm holding a scimitar over a swastika. These non-standard uniform items continued to be worn by members of the division after they became part of the 31st SS Division in October 1944.|$|R

Other furniture in the room inscribed with masonic symbols includes four small timber cube-shaped tables, a velvet upholstered timber kneeling stool, a small timber lift-top desk, and three timber Ionic, Doric and Corinthian half-columns which relate to the three key office bearers. The room contains numerous photos and certificates, and a carved timber and marble honour roll on the northern wall.|$|R
40|$|A simple linear {{dynamical}} model {{shows that}} at normal running speeds of freight wagons, forced oscillations due to periodic track compliance are {{transferred to the}} overlying unsprung mass and significantly amplified. Due to these oscillations, a small gap opens and closes between the collar of a journal bearing and the axle box many times every second. The forces between these components reach peaks of over 10 tonnes. This is {{an environment in which}} wear of the soft spherical graphite iron of the axle box will eventually take place. Due to repeated unloadings of the weight on the bearing during oscillations, the <b>bearing</b> <b>collar</b> may slowly slip against the axle box wall. Although our calculations show that abrasive wear due to this slippage is negligible, the calculation raises general principles that apply to other possible wear mechanisms. If lifetime is proportional to hardness, we can estimate relative lifetimes of refurbished and new boxes. Although the resleeve material is softer than the original, the cost to lifetime ratio would favour refurbishment under this assumption. Important unanswered questions are identified and a specific integrated program of field, laboratory, and theoretical study is suggested...|$|R
50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{are used}} on the ICF bogies. These bearings are press fitted on the axle journal by heating the bearings at a temperature of 80 to 100 °C in an induction furnace. Before fitting the roller <b>bearing,</b> an axle <b>collar</b> is press fitted. The collar ensures that the bearing does not move towards {{the center of the}} axle. After pressing the collar, a rear cover for the axle box is fitted. The rear cover has two main grooves. In one of the grooves, a nitrile rubber sealing ring is placed. The sealing ring ensures that the grease in the axle box housing does not seep out during the running of the wheels. A woolen felt ring is placed in another groove. After the rear cover, a retaining ring is placed. The retaining ring is made of steel and is a press fit. The retaining ring ensures that the rear cover assembly is secured tightly between the axle collar and the retaining ring and stays at one place. The roller bearing is pressed after the retraining ring. Earlier, the <b>collar</b> and the <b>bearings</b> were heated in an oil bath. But now the practices has been discontinued and an induction furnace is used to heat them before fitting on the axle. The axle box housing, which is a steel casting, is then placed on the axle. The bearing is housed in the axle box housing. Axle box grease is filled in the axle box housing. Each axle box housing is filled with approximately 2.5 kg. of grease. The front cover for the axle box is placed on a housing which closes the axle box. The front cover is bolted by using torque wrench.|$|R
50|$|As {{built the}} Britannic {{incorporated}} a novel system which allowed the single propeller {{to be raised}} and lowered while still connected to its shaft and without stopping the engine. This was acheived with a flexible coupling and an elongated aperture in the ship's sternpost. This feature {{was an attempt to}} overcome the disadvantage of long-hulled single-screw liners, which pitched in heavy seas. In bad weather the stern could rise enough to lift the propeller partially out of the water, reducing thrust and causing unpleasant vibration. The Britannic's adjustable propeller was angled below the horizontal when in the lowest position, to ensure the entire propeller remained submerged. In shallow water the shaft could be raised to the horizontal or slightly upwards to reduce the ship's draught and prevent a blade striking the seabed. With the propeller fully raised the entire propeller hub and one blade could be accessed without placing the ship in dry dock - it was hoped this would reduce the cost and time required to change any broken propeller blades. The shaft was raised and lowered by a small auxiliar steam engine in the ship's stern, operating rods connected to a <b>bearing</b> <b>collar</b> on the propeller shaft via a worm drive reduction gear. The system proved reliable and effective at its purpose of keeping the propeller submerged in heavy weather but when set at certain angles the flexible coupling caused heavy vibration and the equipment required significantly more maintenance than a standard drive system. It also reduced the efficiency of the propeller in calm weather unless the angle was adjusted to be perfectly parallel to the line of the hull, making Britannic slower than her conventionally-built sistership, the Germanic. In 1875, after less than year in service, Britannic was taken out of service to be refitted with the same propeller arrangement as her sister - this work required not only removing the propeller mechanism and installing a new drive shaft but also fitting a new bed for the main engine to change its alignment. Once the ship was back in service her performance matched that of the Germanic, allowing the ship to make its own attempts at the Blue Riband.|$|R
