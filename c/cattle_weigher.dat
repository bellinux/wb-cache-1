40|$|In Zimbabwe, {{studies were}} made of the numbers of tsetse (Glossina spp.) and stable flies (Stomoxys spp.) {{attracted}} to cattle of different nutritional status, age and sex. Host odours were analysed to determine the physiological basis of these differences and improved methods are described for measuring rates of production of kairomones. Seasonal fluctuations in host weight, related to changes in pasture quality, had no significant effect on attraction of tsetse or Stomoxys. However, both attraction to different individuals and carbon dioxide production by these individuals were strongly correlated with weight, suggesting a possible link. Attraction to the odour from different types of cattle decreased in the order ox > cow > heifer > calf, and oxen were twice as attractive as calves of less than 12 months old. Lactation did not alter the relative attractiveness of cows. Calves {{less than six months}} old produced lower levels of carbon dioxide, acetone, octenol and phenols than oxen, but for older calves and cows, levels of production of known kairomones and repellents were similar to those of an ox. Carbon dioxide produced by cattle varied according to time of day and the animal's weight; <b>cattle</b> <b>weighing</b> 500 kg produced carbon dioxide at a mean rate of 2. 01 min(- 1) in the morning and 2. 81 min(- 1) in the afternoon compared to respective rates of 1. 1 and 1. 91 min(- 1) for <b>cattle</b> <b>weighing</b> 250 kg. Artificially adjusting the doses of carbon dioxide produced by individual cattle to make them equivalent did not remove significant differences in attractiveness for tsetse but did for Stomoxys. Increasing the dose of carbon dioxide from 1 to 41 min(- 1) in a synthetic blend of identified kairomones simulating those produced by a single ox, increased attractiveness to tsetse but not to the level of an ox.

40|$|The optimum {{duration}} of test for measurement of growth rate, feed intake, feed conversion, and residual feed intake was examined using postweaning feed intake and weight data from 760 Angus, Hereford, Polled Hereford, and Shorthorn heifer and Angus bull progeny from 78 sires. Variance components, heritability, phenotypic and genetic correlations, and the efficiency of selection using shortened tests compared with a 199 -d test were used as criteria to assess the optimum test length. The results indicated that a 35 -d test was sufficient for measurement of feed intake, whereas a 70 -d test was required to measure growth rate, feed conversion, and residual feed intake without compromising the accuracy of measurement. When a 70 -d test is used to measure growth rate, feed conversion, and residual feed intake there is minimal loss in accuracy when weights are collected every 2 wk instead of weekly, but a further increase in the interval between weights to 5 wk caused {{a decline in the}} accuracy of the test.

Liveweight differed from average by 1. 65 - 1. 66 % per mm of rump fat depth and 0. 71 - 0. 76 % per cm(2) of eye muscle area (P< 0. 01). Estimated dry matter digestibility of pasture consumed had no consistent effect in predicting liveweight and was therefore excluded from final models. A method developed to estimate full liveweight of post-weaning age female beef cattle from the other measures taken predicted liveweight to within 10 and 23 % of that recorded for 65 and 95 % of cases, respectively. For a 95 % chance of predicted group average liveweight (body condition score used) being within 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 % of actual group average liveweight required 23, 36, 62, 137 and 521 females, respectively, if precision and accuracy of measurements matches that used in the research. Non-pregnant Bos taurus female cattle were calculated to be 10 - 40 % heavier than Brahmans at the same hip height and body condition, indicating a substantial conformational difference. The liveweight prediction method was applied to a validation population of 83 unrelated groups of <b>cattle</b> <b>weighed</b> in extensive commercial situations on 119 days over 18 months (20 917 assessments). Liveweight prediction in the validation population exceeded average recorded liveweight for weigh groups by an average of 19 kg (similar to 6 %) demonstrating the difficulty of achieving accurate and precise animal measurements under extensive commercial grazing conditions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSeven {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in commercial grazing operations to confirm anthelmintic efficacy, assess acceptability, and measure the productivity response of cattle to treatment with eprinomectin in an extended-release injectable formulation (ERI) when exposed to nematode infected pastures for 120 days. The studies were conducted under one protocol in the USA in seven locations (Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon, and Wisconsin). Each study had 67 – 68 naturally infected animals {{for a total of}} 475 (226 female, 249 male castrate) Angus or beef-cross <b>cattle.</b> The animals <b>weighed</b> 133 – 335 kg prior to treatment and were approximately 3 – 12 months of age. The studies were conducted under a randomized block design based on pre-treatment body weights to sequentially form 17 replicates of four animals each within sex in each study. Animals within a replicate were randomly assigned to treatments, one to Eprinomectin ERI vehicle (control) and three to Eprinomectin ERI (5 %, w/v eprinomectin). Treatments were administered at 1 mL/ 50 kg body weight once subcutaneously anterior to the shoulder. All animals in each study grazed one pasture throughout the observation period of 120 days. <b>Cattle</b> were <b>weighed</b> and fecal samples collected pre-treatment and on 28, 56, 84, and 120 days after treatment for fecal egg and lungworm larval counts. Positive fecal samples generally were cultured en masse to determine the nematode genera attributable to the gastrointestinal helminth infection. Bunostomum, Cooperia, Haemonchus, Nematodirus, Oesophagostomum, Ostertagia, and Trichostrongylus, when present, were referred to as strongylids. At all post-treatment sampling intervals, Eprinomectin ERI-treated cattle had significantly (P< 0. 05) lower strongylid egg counts than vehicle-treated controls, with ≥ 95 % reduction after 120 days of grazing. Over this same period, Eprinomectin ERI-treated cattle gained more weight (43. 9 lb/head) than vehicle-treated controls in all studies. This weight gain advantage was significant (P< 0. 05) in six of the studies with the Eprinomectin ERI-treated cattle gaining an average of 42. 8 % and the control cattle gaining 33. 1 % of their initial weight. No adverse reactions were observed in the treated animals...|$|R

40|$|Metaphylactic {{treatment}} of incoming feedlot cattle {{is a common}} preventative action against bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Cattle are dosed based on estimated or actual lot average weights, rather than on an individual basis, to reduce initial processing time. There has been limited research conducted {{on the effects of}} accurate weight- based dosing in feedlot cattle. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the economic effects of precision weight- based dosing of cattle as compared to dosing the lot average or lot averages plus 50 lb and minus 50 lb. An economic model was created and stochastic simulations performed to evaluate potential outcomes of different dosing scenarios. Economic analyses of the effects of precision weight-based dosing were conducted using SIMETAR? to determine the stochastic dominance and economic effects of different dosing regimens. Data were obtained from a commercial feedlot for different lots of cattle where individual animal weights were available; for this analysis the minimum lot size was 30 animals, and the maximum lot size was 126 animals. Within lots, individual weight deviations were calculated from the lot mean, the lot mean was rounded up to the nearest 50 lb increment or down to the nearest 50 lb increment to represent mild overestimation and mild underestimation, respectively. Tulathromycin (Draxxin?, Pfizer Animal Health, New York, NY), an antimicrobial commonly prescribed for {{treatment of}} bovine respiratory disease, was used to illustrate the impacts of uniform dosing versus exact dosing per body weight. Based on the dilution space method used to evaluate time of drug effectiveness, it was estimated that Draxxin? administered at the recommended dosage to <b>cattle</b> <b>weighing</b> between 500 and 1000 lb should be provided with 191 hours (7. 96 days) of protection from pneumonia-causing bacteria. Due to the pharmacokinetic properties of Draxxin?, an animal that is administered half the recommended dose is only protected from pneumonia-causing bacteria for 8 hours, which is 4. 2 percent of the coverage time of the proper dose. This limits the effectiveness of the prescribed treatment to fully administer therapeutic treatment. In all cases, the correct weight-based dosing strategy cost less than any other dosing technique. Overall, dosing all cattle at the lot average weight costs $ 6. 04 per animal more than dosing at the exact, correct dose. Dosing all animals at the lot average weight plus 50 lb costs $ 6. 24 per animal more; dosing all animals at lot average minus 50 lb costs $ 4. 01 per animal more. The use of individual animal weights to determine per head dosing of Draxxin? is more cost effective than using lot averages. This concept would appear to extend to all weight-based pharmaceutical products in general, and should be considered a necessary management strategy...|$|R
