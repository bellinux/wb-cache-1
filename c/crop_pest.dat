5|$|The {{birds were}} hunted by {{settlers}} on Réunion, who also kept them as cagebirds. Nineteen specimens exist in museums around the world. The hoopoe starling {{was reported to}} be in decline by the early 19th century, and was probably extinct before the 1860s. A number of factors have been proposed, including competition and predation by introduced species, disease, deforestation and persecution by humans, who hunted it for food and as an alleged <b>crop</b> <b>pest.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of western lowland gorillas has allowed humans {{to further the}} study of how gorillas compare with humans in regards to human diseases, behavior, linguistic and psychological aspects of their lives. They are hunted illegally for their skins and meat in Africa and captured {{to be sold to}} zoos. While defended as being economically profitable for restaurants and local people, it is a large contributor to the endangered status of the western lowland gorilla. They are also seen as a <b>crop</b> <b>pest</b> in western Africa because they raid native plantations and therefore destroy what would have otherwise been valuable crops.|$|E
500|$|Hunting {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as a factor in}} the extinction of the Cuban macaw. Parrots were hunted, kept as pets, and traded by Amerindians in the Caribbean before the arrival of Europeans. The Cuban macaw was reportedly [...] "stupid" [...] and slow to escape, and therefore was easily caught. It was killed for food; Gemelli Careri found the meat tasty, but Gundlach considered it tough. Archaeological evidence suggests the Cuban macaw was hunted in Havana in the 16th–18th centuries. It may also have been persecuted as a <b>crop</b> <b>pest,</b> though it did not live near dwellings.|$|E

500|$|Within {{the whole}} Indochinese region, {{populations of the}} pygmy slow loris have {{drastically}} decreased {{as a result of}} military activities, defoliant spraying, logging, and massive off-takes, especially in Vietnam. It has been extirpated {{in the northern part of}} this country due to the belief that it is a <b>crop</b> <b>pest.</b> The demand of the pet and the medicinal markets is further aggravating the situation, which is reflected by its abundance in many local markets. This demand has recently increased due to human population growth and improved economic conditions within the region. [...] According to CITES, this activity is considered unsustainable.|$|E
500|$|The Sunda slow loris {{is further}} {{threatened}} by gathering for illegal traditional medicine. The fur {{is reported to}} heal wounds, the flesh to cure epilepsy, eyes are used in love potions, and the meat is reported to cure asthma and stomach problems. It is also killed as a <b>crop</b> <b>pest.</b> [...] Severe habitat loss and degradation over large areas of its range have caused large population declines, even though the species is more adaptable to anthropogenic habitats than other primates in the region. The resulting fragmentation has restricted species dispersal as it depends on continuous canopy cover to move from tree to tree.|$|E

In this study, a 3 -layer architecture web-based information service platform (ISP) for protected <b>crop</b> <b>pests</b> was developed using HTML, JavaScript and active server page (ASP). The platform included the information management module, the aided diagnosis module, the module of instructions for pest control, the technology BBS module, the system management module and the relative references module. Two logical algorithms, namely, identification key method and fuzzy diagnostic method, were designed for aided diagnosis of protected <b>crop</b> <b>pests.</b> The ISP could provide a technological platform for decision makers, agricultural technique extension workers and farmers. It is favorable to the effective management of protected <b>crop</b> <b>pests...</b>|$|R

40|$|One asset of {{wildlife}} to landowners {{is the potential}} but understudied role of birds and other species as endemic natural enemies of <b>crop</b> <b>pests.</b> Enhancing such natural enemies as part of sustainable agricultural systems offers promise for maintaining agricultural competitiveness while providing wildlife habitat in intensively farmed areas. The University of Nebraska has established an agroforestry research team to address interdisciplinary questions and outreach associated with this topic. Included are studies of bird, mammal, and insect use of woody and herbaceous corridors and adjacent cropfields in east-central Nebraska. Uncultivated areas needed to sustain natural enemies of <b>crop</b> <b>pests</b> also provide other benefits. Properly planned windbreak edges, for example, can enhance stewardship of soil and water by preventing erosion, conserving moisture, and increasing dryland crop yields. Management practices that enhance endemic natural enemies of <b>crop</b> <b>pests</b> and provide other benefits can better ensure long-term continuation of agriculture and living wild resources, an opportunity for extension education and future research...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{insecticides}} for estate <b>crop</b> <b>pests</b> {{control are}} ineffective, impractical, expensive, and causing environmental pollutions. The entomopathogenic virus (EPV) mainly the nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) {{can be developed}} as an effective, efficient, and environmentally friendly biopesticide. NPV can be survived {{in the field in}} the form of polyhedra and spread naturally through the vertical and horizontal transmission process. The infected larvae usually hang by pseudolegs to the leaves or entrees. Research to increase virulence, host spectrum and its persistence has been done to overcome some weaknesses of NPV if developed as biopesticide. Some NPV isolates that infect the estate <b>crop</b> <b>pests</b> and potential to be developed in Indonesia, among others: Spodoptera litura NPV (SlNPV), S. exigua NPV (SeNPV), Helicoverpa armigera NPV (HaNPV), Sethotosea asigna NPV (SaNPV), Hyposidra talaca NPV (HtNPV) and Maenas maculifascia NPV (MmNPV).
