25|$|Alkylating {{agents are}} the oldest group of <b>chemotherapeutics</b> in use today. Originally derived from mustard gas used in World War I, {{there are now}} many types of alkylating agents in use. They are so named because {{of their ability to}} {{alkylate}} many molecules, including proteins, RNA and DNA. This ability to bind covalently to DNA via their alkyl group is the primary cause for their anti-cancer effects. DNA is made of two strands and the molecules may either bind twice to one strand of DNA (intrastrand crosslink) or may bind once to both strands (interstrand crosslink). If the cell tries to replicate crosslinked DNA during cell division, or tries to repair it, the DNA strands can break. This leads to a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis. Alkylating agents will work at any point in the cell cycle and thus are known as cell cycle-independent drugs. For this reason the effect on the cell is dose dependent; the fraction of cells that die is directly proportional to the dose of drug.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} treatment method is an intravenous injection with antimony compounds, such as pentostam. Unfortunately, these <b>chemotherapeutics</b> are so poisonous that about 15% {{of the patients}} die from the treaments. To compound the situation, drug resistance has evolved in the parasites against the traditional antimonials. According to rough estimates, about 40% of patients in India are already resistant to this therapy. Another antimicrobial drug amphotericin B is also commonly used. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) has been a drug of choice in India, but is practically useless in Africa because of low effectiveness in the African strain of the parasite. Further, amphotericin B has severe adverse effects. Its acute effects includes nausea, vomiting, rigors, fever, hypertension or hypotension, and hypoxia, and its chronic effect is nephrotoxicity. In 1999 an anticancer drug miltefosine was demonstrated to be highly effective (95% cure rate) among Indian patients. This {{was the first time}} an oral drug is effective for visceral leishmaniasis. Clinical trials showed that the new drug is relatively harmless. The most adverse effects were only vomiting and diarrhoea in 20–28% patients, which were rather mild. The drug has been officially approved in India. The recommended dosage is 100mg per day over a period of four weeks.|$|E
25|$|Targeted therapies are a {{relatively}} new class of cancer drugs that can overcome {{many of the issues}} seen with the use of cytotoxics. They are divided into two groups: small molecule and antibodies. The massive toxicity seen with the use of cytotoxics is {{due to the lack of}} cell specificity of the drugs. They will kill any rapidly dividing cell, tumor or normal. Targeted therapies are designed to affect cellular proteins or processes that are utilised by the cancer cells. This allows a high dose to cancer tissues with {{a relatively}} low dose to other tissues. As different proteins are utilised by different cancer types, the targeted therapy drugs are used on a cancer type specific, or even on a patient specific basis. Although the side effects are often less severe than that seen of cytotoxic <b>chemotherapeutics,</b> life-threatening effects can occur. Initially, the targeted therapeutics were supposed to be solely selective for one protein. Now it is clear that there is often a range of protein targets that the drug can bind. An example target for targeted therapy is the protein produced by the Philadelphia chromosome, a genetic lesion found commonly in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. This fusion protein has enzyme activity that can be inhibited by imatinib, a small molecule drug.|$|E
25|$|Resistance is a {{major cause}} of {{treatment}} failure in chemotherapeutic drugs. There are a few possible causes of resistance in cancer, one of which is the presence of small pumps on the surface of cancer cells that actively move chemotherapy from inside the cell to the outside. Cancer cells produce high amounts of these pumps, known as p-glycoprotein, in order to protect themselves from <b>chemotherapeutics.</b> Research on p-glycoprotein and other such chemotherapy efflux pumps is currently ongoing. Medications to inhibit the function of p-glycoprotein are undergoing investigation, but due to toxicities and interactions with anti-cancer drugs their development has been difficult. Another mechanism of resistance is gene amplification, a process in which multiple copies of a gene are produced by cancer cells. This overcomes the effect of drugs that reduce the expression of genes involved in replication. With more copies of the gene, the drug can not prevent all expression of the gene and therefore the cell can restore its proliferative ability. Cancer cells can also cause defects in the cellular pathways of apoptosis (programmed cell death). As most chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells in this manner, defective apoptosis allows survival of these cells, making them resistant. Many chemotherapy drugs also cause DNA damage, which can be repaired by enzymes in the cell that carry out DNA repair. Upregulation of these genes can overcome the DNA damage and prevent the induction of apoptosis. Mutations in genes that produce drug target proteins, such as tubulin, can occur which prevent the drugs from binding to the protein, leading to resistance to these types of drugs. Drugs used in chemotherapy can induce cell stress, which can kill a cancer cell; however, under certain conditions, cells stress can induce changes in gene expression that enables resistance to several types of drugs.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{important}} alteration is methylation of MGMT, a [...] "suicide" [...] DNA repair enzyme. Methylation {{is described}} to impair DNA transcription and therefore, {{expression of the}} MGMT enzyme. Since an MGMT enzyme can only repair one DNA alkylation due to its suicide repair mechanism, reverse capacity is low and methylation of the MGMT gene promoter greatly affects DNA-repair capacity. Indeed, MGMT methylation is associated with an improved response to treatment with DNA-damaging <b>chemotherapeutics,</b> such as temozolomide.|$|E

50|$|A phase III {{trial for}} {{patients}} with relapsed soft tissue sarcoma comparing aldoxorubicin with several other <b>chemotherapeutics</b> is expected to complete in 2018. In November 2016, CytRx announced that preliminary results had been positive.|$|E
50|$|The ubiquitin-independent p53 {{degradation}} pathway {{is regulated}} by NQO1. NQO1 stabilizes p53, protecting it from degradation. Individuals with decreased NQO1 expression/activity have reduced p53 stability, which {{may lead to}} resistance to drugs such as <b>chemotherapeutics.</b>|$|E
50|$|Its {{primary use}} {{is that of}} a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. Previous studies in animal models have found it to be {{effective}} at preventing cancer cell resistance to <b>chemotherapeutics,</b> but these findings did not translate to clinical success.|$|E
50|$|A {{synthetic}} lethal {{approach to}} cancer therapy {{is currently being}} explored {{as a means of}} developing therapies that reduce off-target effects of chemotherapies and chemopreventative drugs. Cancer cells are marked by genetic instability, errors in DNA repair, and uncontrolled transcription, which create new synthetic lethal partners in cancer cells. Because a drug effect targeting a specific gene product resembles the phenotype caused by a mutation in that gene, a cancer-related mutation can sensitize cancer cells to <b>chemotherapeutics</b> that target its synthetic lethal partner. Consequently, drugs that target synthetic lethal partners of mutations in cancer cells may not be toxic to normal cells, which could avoid off-target side effects of <b>chemotherapeutics.</b>|$|E
50|$|Consequently, the {{combination}} of mifamurtide with these types of drugs is contraindicated. However, mifamurtide can be coadministered with low doses of NSAIDs. No evidence suggests mifamurtide interacts with the studied <b>chemotherapeutics,</b> or with the cytochrome P450 system.|$|E
5000|$|Accumulative {{research}} suggests that dihydroartemisinin and other artemisinin-based endoperoxide compounds may display activity as experimental cancer <b>chemotherapeutics.</b> [...] Recent pharmacological evidence demonstrates that dihydroartemisinin targets human metastatic melanoma cells with induction of NOXA-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis that occurs downstream of iron-dependent generation of cytotoxic oxidative stress.|$|E
50|$|The {{nickname}} VP-16 likely {{comes from}} a compounding of the last name {{of one of the}} chemists who performed early work on the drug (Von Wartburg) and podophyllotoxin. Another scientist who was integral in the development of podophyllotoxin-based <b>chemotherapeutics</b> was the medical pharmacologist Hartmann F. Stähelin.|$|E
50|$|Clozapine is {{an example}} of a drug used in the {{treatment}} of certain CNS disorders, such as schizophrenia, that has superior efficacy precisely because of its broad-spectrum mode of action. Likewise, in cancer <b>chemotherapeutics,</b> it has been recognized that drugs active at more than one target have a higher probability of being efficacious.|$|E
5000|$|Clozapine and latrepirdine are {{examples}} of drugs used {{in the treatment of}} CNS disorders that have a superior efficacy precisely because of their [...] "multifarious" [...] broadspectrum mode of activity.

50|$|Finally, it is {{also worth}} noting that lactate {{concentrations}} are positively correlated with radioresistance. Many anticancer therapies, including ionizing radiation and many <b>chemotherapeutics,</b> rely on the overproduction of reactive oxygen species to cause genomic instability. Lactate, as an antioxidant, may act to scrub down the levels of reactive oxygen species thus enhancing resistance to radiation and chemotherapy.|$|E
50|$|KP1019, or trans-H-indazole)ruthenate(III), {{is one of}} two {{ruthenium}} anti-cancer {{drugs to}} enter into phase I clinical trials, the other being NAMI-A. Research into ruthenium-based drugs has provided novel alternatives for platinum-based <b>chemotherapeutics</b> such as Cisplatin and its derivatives. KP1019 is useful for metastatic tumors and cis-platin resistant tumors. It exhibits potent cytotoxicity against primary tumors, particularly in colorectal cancer.|$|E
5000|$|Wright's {{research}} work involved studying {{the effects of}} various drugs on tumors, {{and she was the}} first to identify methotrexate, one of the foundational chemotherapy drugs, as an effective tool against cancerous tumors. [...] Wright's early work brought chemotherapy out of the realm of an untested, experimental hypothetical treatment, into the realm of tested, proven effective cancer therapeutics—thus literally saving millions of lives. Wright later pioneered combinatorial work in <b>chemotherapeutics,</b> focusing not simply on administering multiple drugs, but sequential and dosage variations to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy and minimize side effects. [...] She was successful in identifying treatments for both breast and skin cancer, developing a chemotherapy protocol that increased skin cancer patient lifespans up to ten years. She published more than 100 papers on cancer <b>chemotherapeutics</b> during her career and served on the editorial board of the Journal of the National Medical Association.|$|E
50|$|If {{cellular}} polyamine synthesis is inhibited, cell {{growth is}} stopped or severely retarded. The provision of exogenous polyamines restores {{the growth of}} these cells. Most eukaryotic cells have a polyamine transporter system on their cell membrane that facilitates the internalization of exogenous polyamines. This system is highly active in rapidly proliferating cells and is the target of some <b>chemotherapeutics</b> currently under development.|$|E
50|$|Lactobacillus fermentum {{belongs to}} the genus Lactobacillus. Species in this genus are used {{for a wide variety}} of {{applications}}. These applications include food and feed fermentation. It has been found that some strains for Lactobacillus fermentum have natural resistances to certain antibiotics and <b>chemotherapeutics.</b> They are considered potential vectors of antibiotic resistance genes from the environment to humans or animals to humans.|$|E
50|$|Actinobacillus (Pasteurella) ureae and A. hominis {{occur in}} the {{respiratory}} tracts of healthy humans and {{may be involved in}} the pathogenesis of sinusitis, bronchopneumonia, and meningitis. A. actinomycetemcomitans occurs in the human oral microflora, and together with anaerobic or capnophilic organisms (HACEK group organisms) may cause endocarditis. Actinobacilli are susceptible to most antibiotics of the beta-lactam family, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and many other antibacterial <b>chemotherapeutics.</b>|$|E
50|$|Novel agents like thalidomide, lenalidomide and bortezomib {{have been}} {{recently}} used, {{alone or in}} combination with conventional <b>chemotherapeutics</b> like melphalan or cyclophosphamide. Two cases had encouraging results with bortezomib. Recent studies demonstrate that velcade (bortezomib)- based regimens offer a significant profit in patients suffering from PCL. More aggressive therapeutic regimens like DT-PACE or protocols used in ALL offer a significant response rate, but with short remission interval.|$|E

5000|$|Understanding the {{mediation}} of electron-transfer chemistry by the DNA double helix has laid a foundation {{for the development of}} new diagnostic tools and for the possible design of novel <b>chemotherapeutics.</b> [...] Barton, Erik Holmlin, Shana Kelley, and Mike Hill created the company GeneOhm Sciences to explore the development of sensitive diagnostics for detecting DNA mismatches. The company has since been acquired by BD Diagnostics.|$|E
5000|$|Various chemotherapies {{are used}} {{and there is}} no clear {{consensus}} on which drugs should be used. Mitomycin C is the most commonly used agent because {{it was one of the}} first used drugs for this therapy and less expensive than some of the alternatives. With the advent of platinum based <b>chemotherapeutics,</b> oxaliplatin has started gaining more popularity. Although both have proven similar efficacy so far, some argue that oxaliplatin tends to have better results.|$|E
50|$|Conventional <b>chemotherapeutics</b> are {{currently}} being {{used in conjunction with}} radiation therapy to increase its effectiveness. Examples include the fluoropyrimidines, gemcitabine and platinum analogs; fluoropyrimidines increase sensitivity by dysregulating S-phase cell cycle checkpoints in tumor cells. Gemcitabine progresses through a similar mechanism, causing cells in the S-phase to disrepair DNA damage caused by the radiation. Platinum analogs such as cisplatin inhibit DNA repair by cross linking strands, and so exacerbate the effects of DNA damage induced by radiation.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{important}} alteration is methylation of MGMT, a [...] "suicide" [...] DNA repair enzyme.

50|$|Several {{important}} anticancer agents both bind to DNA {{and generate}} reactive oxygen species. These include adriamycin and other anthracyclines, bleomycin, and cisplatin. These agents may show specific toxicity towards cancer cells {{because of the}} low level of antioxidant defenses found in tumors. Recent research demonstrates that redox dysregulation originating from metabolic alterations and dependence on mitogenic and survival signaling through reactive oxygen species represents a specific vulnerability of malignant cells that can be selectively targeted by pro-oxidant non-genotoxic redox <b>chemotherapeutics.</b>|$|E
50|$|Veliparib (ABT-888) is a {{potential}} anti-cancer drug acting as a PARP inhibitor. It kills cancer cells by blocking a protein called PARP, thereby preventing the repair of DNA or genetic damage in cancer cells and possibly making them more susceptible to anticancer treatments. Veliparib may make whole brain radiation treatment work more effectively against brain metastases from NSCLC. It {{has been shown to}} potentiate the effects of many <b>chemotherapeutics,</b> and as such has been part of many combination clinical trials.|$|E
