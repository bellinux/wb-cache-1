50|$|Ripe rot, {{the more}} common name for anthracnose, is a disease {{localized}} mostly to {{the northern and southern}} blueberry-growing regions. However has been spreading east and it is now estimated to infect 30% of the eastern blueberry growing regions. Much like leaf spot, ripe rot symptoms appear as the blueberry begins to ripen and mature. Once the blueberry has ripened, it softens and orange spores will be exuded. This disease can be especially costly because if a diseased berry showing no symptoms is put in a container of untainted berries it can very quickly infect the entire <b>container.</b> <b>Control</b> of this disease is achieved with fungicidal applications every 1-2 weeks.|$|E
40|$|The STS Space Suited and unsuited {{dominant}} {{upper limb}} performance was evaluated {{in order to}} quantify future EVA astronaut skeletal muscle upper limb performance expectations. Testing was performed with subjects standing in EVA STS foot restraints. Data was collected with a CYBEX Dynamometer enclosed in a waterproof <b>container.</b> <b>Control</b> data was taken in one g. During one g testing, weight of the Space Suit was relieved from the subject via an overhead crane with a special connection to the PLSS of the suit. Experimental data was acquired during simulated zero g, accomplished by neutral buoyancy in the Weightless Environment Training Facility. Unsuited subjects became neutrally buoyant via SCUBA BC vests. Actual zero g experimental data was collected during parabolic arc flights on board NASA's modified KC- 135 aircraft. During all test conditions, subjects performed five EVA work tasks requiring dominant upper limb performance and ten individual joint articulation movements. Dynamometer velocities for each tested movement were 0 deg/sec, 30 or 60 deg/sec and 120 or 180 deg/sec, depending on the test, with three repetitions per test. Performance was measured in foot pounds of torque...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of cocoa fermentation methods using fermentation container of "thermos" system allows watery sweatings {{byproduct of the}} pulp of cocoa beans can be accommodated. The {{purpose of this study}} were: 1) to study the effect of using fermentation container of thermos system for the quantity and characteristics of the watery sweatings byproduct of the pulp of cocoa beans during fermentation 2) get the watery sweatings byproduct of the pulp of cocoa beans as a potential feedstock of acetic acid. This study used a factorial BRD with 2 factors. The first factor is the container material type of fermentation of "thermos" system which consists of three types, namely: wood, plastic, and a single <b>container</b> (<b>control)</b> and the second factor is the time of fermentation consists of 6 levels, namely: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 days. Each treatment combination (18 combinations) was made in 2 groups to obtain 36 experiment units. Observations made include: the temperature in the pile of cocoa beans, the quantity (% w/w), pH, and total acid (meq NaOH/g). The results show that: 1) the use of container material type of fermentation of "thermos" system and the fermentation time affect temperatures in the piles of cocoa beans and characteristics such as: quantity, pH, and total acid content of watery sweating byproduct produced during fermentation of cocoa beans and 2) fermentation container of "thermos" system of wood with a time of ferment 1 - 2 days to produce a watery sweating byproduct of the fermented cocoa beans as a potential feedstock of acetic acid.

40|$|International actors from International Organizations, Western States, Think tanks, risk {{management}} consultancies, NGOs, and private security companies understand borderless threats like clandestine migration, drug trafficking, and international terrorism to emanate from ‘ungoverned spaces’ in the Global South. The Sahelian sub-region of West Africa {{has taken a}} prominent place in global discourses of insecurity and borderless threats. These non-traditional security concerns have been translated into an expanding array of transnational governance initiatives that bring together the activities and practices {{of a wide range}} of state and non-state, global and local, and public and private actors in efforts to deal with the challenges that borderless threats are assumed to present. This dissertation argues that attempts to govern drug trafficking in the Sahel are producing global assemblages of security intervention: shifting, multi-scalar, institutional orders that reorient and reconfigure the security practices, knowledges, mentalities, technologies, and priorities of multiple sets of governance actors across disparate jurisdictional spaces. The effects of the transnationalized security governance and capacity-building initiatives that unfold in simultaneous, connected spaces of intervention amplify and alter positions of social power and prominence in local fields of conflict. Through the practices and projects of global security experts and capacity-builders in the Sahel, new forms of international capital are introduced and become realized in local settings that intensify rivalries between local, national, and regional security institutions over the question of the recognition of their authority over security matters. In their relationships with international capacity-builders and other global actors, sets of local recipients of security governance interventions practice forms of extraversion whereby their structural positions of dependence and differentials of power and resources are leveraged to accumulate forms of international capital that they then use to dominate the fields of power in which they are embedded. The dissertation examines three components of the assemblages of security intervention in West Africa: the effects of the transnational field of capacity- building in the Sahelian interior; the establishment and operation of the UNODC Airport Communications drug interdiction project (AIRCOP) at Dakar’s International Airport, and the joint UNODC/World Customs Organization <b>Container</b> <b>Control</b> Programme operating at the port of Dakar. It advances new empirical material from these case studies, and makes contributions to debates in three sub-fields of International Relations: critical security studies, global governance, and international statebuilding...|$|E

40|$|Background: Drinking-water is {{purified}} {{by various}} methods like UV irradiation, heat treatment, adding disinfectants like chlorine etc. Aims of purification include reducing turbidity and elements, increasing taste and removing microbes. There is no singlemethod available which can fulfill entire expectation. Siddha literatures {{claim that the}} purification could be achieved by soaking certain herbals. Objective: The present study was done to evaluate the water purifying property of Phyllanthus emblicawood. Materials and method: 1. 5 L of water was taken in two different <b>containers.</b> <b>Control</b> <b>container</b> water was kept as such. Phyllanthus emblica wood pieces (75 g) were soaked in test container. After 48 hrs, two groups of water were filtered and investigated for physical properties, elements and level of microorganisms. Result: The color, odor, turbidity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, total alkalinity, calcium, iron, chloride and nitrate level were increased in the test container. pH, total hardness, sulphate and magnesium levels were decreased in the test container. Level of Escherichia coli, total coliforms and faecal coliforms were reduced in the test container. Conclusion: Soaking Phyllanthus emblica wood improves the purity of water.

Sterile swabs were pre-wetted by peptone water and used to swab 25  cm 2 of inner surfaces (of the smoked, non-smoked and chlorine-treated, and non-smoked and non-chlorine-treated plastic milk-handling containers in triplicates).
