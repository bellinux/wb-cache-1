40|$|The Volvo PCR (Pre <b>Crash</b> <b>Recorder)</b> {{is meant}} to {{function}} as a complement to the existing DARR (Digital Accident Research Recorder). The latter is a digital crash pulse recorder that has been installed in Volvo cars since 1994. It records approximately 60 deceleration values in 180 ms upon front airbag deployment. The PCR records 31 selected parameters (table 1) every 500 ms, starting 5 seconds before a crash, and stores them in an electronic memory (EEPROM). This thesis aimed at developing methods and tools for the evaluation of the PCR data. This was done by first explaining and evaluating the parameters thoroughly. A BASIC program was then constructed for the decoding of t he hexadecimal PCR data. This program was also used {{in the construction of the}} fictitious example of an accident investigation that is included in this report. The most important conclusion from this thesis was that:. The PCR data should be used as in-parameters in accident research, e. g. the location of the occupants and their body parts in the collision moment, the vehicle speed or the status and function of the vehicle safety systems.. The extracted PCR data should be presented in a clear way, possibly in an excel chart. This can easily be achieved by using a program like the one developed in this thesis.. It is recommendable that the parameters are evaluated in small groups or pairs. For example could the steering wheel angle be plotted with the actual yaw rate and the active-safety system parameters with the accelerations and rotations (roll and yaw) of the car.. When recreating the course of an accident it is suitable to make simple figures from every sampling moment to clarify the big picture. For the future it is recommended to add more parameters to the recordings and develop methods [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimitedThe design, breadboard implementation, and functional testing of a <b>Crash</b> Data <b>Recorder</b> for military aircraft is reported. A microcomputer {{is used to}} analyze the flight parameters, reduce redundant data, and record only significant information to be used in post-crash analysis. Nonvolatile solid state memory is used as the recording medium. Functional tests indicate that the solid state recorder's reliability is higher than that of mechanical magnetic tape recorders while cost, weight, size, and required maintenance are greatly reduced. The microcomputer provides an expansion capability for future applications of the flight recorder. Research and development, structural history, maintenance analysis, and training are areas where the <b>Crash</b> Data <b>Recorder</b> can also serve as an analytical tool.

40|$|Whiplash {{associated}} disorders, {{also called}} whiplash injuries or AIS 1 neck injuries, represent {{one of the}} most significant types of injury in car crashes regarding both frequency and long-term consequences. The injury mechanisms are not fully understood, thus making it difficult to design and evaluate protection systems in cars. The highest risk is found in rear-end impacts, but the largest number of incidents is found in frontal impacts. This thesis focuses on occupants in frontal as well as rear-end impacts and presents an approach leading to development of AIS 1 neck injury protection systems. Several parameters influencing risk of AIS 1 neck injuries in frontal and rear-end impacts are identified by analysing accident data. Subsets of Volvo's accident database are used for the analyses. Additional information was collected for two of the studies regarding details in sitting posture and neck symptoms including duration, and in one study crash pulse information from on-board crash recorders is analysed. Field impact scenarios, with different AIS 1 neck injury risk, are simulated using computer models and sled tests to get additional data on the loading conditions in the human body and to enable the identification of responses correlating to relative injury risk. Biomechanical guidelines have been derived, and evaluation criteria are suggested for rear-end impacts. A whiplash mitigation seat, WHIPS (WHIplash Prevention System), was developed for rear-end impacts, based on this study. The AIS 1 neck injury reducing effect of WHIPS is evaluated, demonstrating not only the significant efficiency of the seat but also the feasibility of the approach chosen. For frontal as well as rear-end impacts, women are found to have a higher AIS 1 neck injury risk. In rear-end impacts, increased occupant stature is related to increased injury risk, while in frontal impacts, decreased occupant weight is related to increased injury risk. Prior neck problems is found to be a risk factor irrespective of impact direction. Sitting posture, however, is influential with respect to different parameters in frontal and rear-end impacts. In frontal impacts, change of velocity and deceleration based measures are identified as possible impact severity measures using <b>crash</b> <b>recorder</b> data. In rear-end impacts, the biomechanical guidelines are to reduce occupant acceleration, reduce relative spine movements and reduce occupant rebound. In order to reflect the biomechanical guidelines in sled tests, evaluation criteria are suggested. Concerning frontal impacts, initial relative neck movements are suggested to be kept as small as possible in this first step. The significance of this thesis is twofold. Firstly, identification of various influential parameters and visualisation of possible injury causing kinematics, adding knowledge to the puzzle of understanding AIS 1 neck injuries in frontal and rear-end impacts. Secondly, development and evaluation of a feasible and robust low-risk approach, implementing a safe direction in the development of protection systems for an injury type where the knowledge of injury mechanisms is limited...|$|E
5000|$|The {{disappearance}} of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 demonstrated {{the limits of}} the contemporary flight recorder technology, namely how physical possession of the flight recorder device is necessary to help investigate the cause of an aircraft incident. Considering the advances of modern communication, technology commentators called for flight recorders to be supplemented or replaced by a system that provides [...] "live streaming" [...] of data from the aircraft to the ground. Furthermore, commentators called for the underwater locator beacon's range and battery life to be extended, as well as the outfitting of civil aircraft with the deployable flight recorders typically used in military aircraft. Previous to MH370, the investigators of the 2009 Air France Flight 447 urged to extend the battery life as [...] "rapidly as possible" [...] after the <b>crash's</b> flight <b>recorders</b> went unrecovered for over a year.|$|R

40|$|Given {{that over}} a million people are fatally injured in road {{accidents}} each year, {{the need for a}} systematic proactive approach is undeniable. The Swedish Road Administration (SRA) has developed a model for a safe road transport system based on the Vision Zero philosophy, to identify and prevent deviations from a safe system approach with regard to crashes. The overall objective of this thesis was: to study road crashes using this system approach, to identify whether the SRA model could be used to classify fatal crashes, and to identify system weaknesses as well as important factors {{that need to be addressed}} to further develop a safe road transport system. The thesis comprises four studies based on real-world crashes in Sweden. Three kinds of data were used in the studies: in-depth fatal crash data, in-depth car crashes involving cars fitted with an on-board <b>crash</b> pulse <b>recorder,</b> and observational data. In two studies, the aim was to investigate the interactions between a few safety performance indicators (SPIs), and how these indicators could be used to identify the most important factors in road crashes. The other two studies focused on SPIs of the vehicle and the road, to evaluate whether the SPIs used reflect the most important factors in the system. The aims of these two studies were also to present average crash severity, depending on collision partner as well as road safety standard. Most road traffic injuries are related to an interaction between the three components: the road, the vehicle and the road user. Therefore a system approach is needed to analyse crashes and to find preventive interventions. The SRA model was found to be useful for classifying in-depth fatal crashes. However, to identify weaknesses in the road traffic system, a more sophisticated model is needed. Based on crashes involving cars fitted with an on-board <b>crash</b> pulse <b>recorder,</b> <b>crash</b> severity was found to differ depending on collision partner. Frontal two-vehicle crashes and single-vehicle crashes with rigid roadside objects were shown to generate the highest crash severity. The least harmful crash type was single-vehicle crashes into deformable objects. Furthermore, crash severity was lower in crashes occurring on roads with a good safety rating than in those that occurred on roads with a poor safety rating. While it was found that a higher speed limit resulted in higher crash severity on roads with a poor safety rating, the opposite was found on roads with a good safety rating. The main reason for this was that lanes for traffic travelling in opposite directions were more often separated at higher speeds on roads with a good safety rating. On divided roads, no crashes resulted in a crash severity above the level corresponding to a 10 % risk of sustaining serious or fatal injury. Simultaneous 100 % fulfilment of a set of SPIs (sober driver, non-excessive speed, seat belt use and divided roads) also supports this finding, since only 5 % of all fatalities on rural roads in Sweden occurred under these circumstances. Divided roads are therefore one of the most important SPIs for car occupants. The overall the results of the thesis indicates that it is necessary to establish a system approach, where the road infrastructure is based on the capabilities and limitations of human beings through good road and vehicle design...|$|R
50|$|The seat is {{considered}} third generation and includes advanced features. For example, it senses {{the conditions of}} the ejection (airspeed and altitude) and selects the appropriate drogue and main parachute deployments to minimize the forces on the occupant. The seat is controlled by a fully redundant digital electronic sequencer which makes the decisions and initiates the appropriate seat components to allow the seat to fly through the air and safely descend the aircrew to the ground. The sequencer includes a <b>crash</b> data <b>recorder</b> that contains ejection information that can be later analyzed during crash investigations to understand the dynamics of the ejection as well as loads on the aircrew during the event. The seat propulsion system is specially designed with technology to compensate for aircrew weight so that the 103 lb small female aircrew gets a similar acceleration to the 245 lb male pilot. The seat has been updated over the years through pre-planned product improvement programs to include digital sequencing, additional redundancy, enhance stability, limb restraints, structural upgrading, and passive head/neck restraints. The ACES II seat ejection injury rate is one of the lowest in the world as proven in over 600 live ejections. Back injury rates occur in only 1% of ACES ejections compared to 20% to 40% in most other ejection seats.|$|R
50|$|Early reports {{suggested}} that Flight 612 {{may have been}} caught in a thunderstorm; immediately prior to the crash, the pilots notified air traffic control that they were experiencing severe turbulence. According to the residents of a nearby town, the weather {{at the time of}} the crash was violent enough to cause power outages and cell phone disruptions on the ground. Authorities on the scene have speculated that the aircraft was struck by lightning which may have initiated an onboard fire. However, another theory has since been proposed. Based on various information, including the partially deciphered information from a recovered flight <b>recorder,</b> <b>crash</b> investigators believe that the aircraft climbed to an altitude higher than the maximum for which it was designed, causing the aircraft to enter into a flat spin from which it never recovered.|$|R
