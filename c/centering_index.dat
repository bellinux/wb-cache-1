40|$|Grey target {{decision}} {{model for}} mixed attributes including real numbers, interval numbers, triangular fuzzy numbers, and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers is complex for its data processing {{in different ways}} and information distortion in handling fuzzy numbers. To solve these problems, the binary connection number proposed in set pair analysis is applied to unify different types of index values with their parameters’ average values and standard deviations as determinacy-uncertainty vectors. Then the target <b>center</b> <b>index</b> vectors {{are determined by the}} modules of index vectors of all alternatives under different attributes. So the similarity of each index vector and its target <b>center</b> <b>index</b> vector called nearness degree can be calculated. Following, all the nearness degrees are normalized in linear method in order to be compared with each other. Finally, the optimal alternative can be determined by the minimum of all integrated nearness degrees. Case study demonstrated that this approach can not only unify different types of numbers, and simplify the calculation but also reduce the information distortion in operating fuzzy numbers...|$|R

Through the prolate spheroidal wave functions, the number of equivalent targets of a volumetric source is derived, and from it, the minimum number of observations required to apply subspace superresolution methods is computed. The minimum tomographic aperture length is also investigated.

Miseria, depicted by a chained beggar, is not considered a valuable card. The face cards and the Fugitive (the Fool) are unnumbered and unlabelled. Unlike other tarot games, the Fugitive cannot lead a trick unless it is the last trick. The deck is single faced and not reversible.

40|$|Abstract—Providing high {{availability}} in a diverse client de-mand scenario {{is a key}} challenge of cloud computing providers. A possible approach to protect cloud systems from natural disasters corresponds to the utilization of redundant data centers located far enough apart. The time to migrate a virtual machine (VM) from a data center to another increases due to distance. As this time impacts the overall system behavior, performability evaluation considering VM migration time and different load balances is of utmost importance when considering the analysis of distributed cloud systems. This work presents performability models for evaluating distributed cloud computing systems de-ployed into multiple data centers considering disaster occurrence. Additionally, we present a case study which evaluates a set of scenarios with different client loads and distances between data <b>centers.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—performability evaluation, IaaS systems, stochastic petri net...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{study of}} the effects of traps on the RF charac-teristics of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs is {{conducted}} using small and large-signal microwave measurements with deep-level optical spectroscopy. Different variations of the drain current swing are observed for illuminations of different photon energies. The time evolution of the current swing in transient measurements enabled to determine the optical transient time-constant and the equilibrium relaxation time-constant. The dependence of the S-parameters upon the illumination yielded results consistent with the variation of the drain current swing under illumination. A variation in the small signal transconductance and drain conductance was extracted at 2 GHz which presumably arises from the variation of the drain resistance under illumination. In addition, it was verified that the SiN passivation greatly helps in mitigating the RF performance degradation arising from deep trapping <b>centers.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Amplifier distortion, current, MODFETs, opti-cal spectroscopy, charge carrier processes...|$|R
