5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} forages along {{tree trunks}} and branches {{in a similar}} way to woodpeckers and treecreepers, but does not use its tail for additional support, instead progressing in jerky hops using its strong legs and feet. All nuthatches are distinctive when seeking food because they are able to descend tree trunks head-first and <b>can</b> <b>hang</b> upside-down beneath twigs and branches.|$|E
5|$|As an {{arboreal}} lizard, V. salvadorii <b>can</b> <b>hang</b> onto {{branches with}} its rear legs and occasionally use its tail as a prehensile grip. The primary {{use of the}} tail, however, is to counterbalance its weight when leaping from one branch to another. The tail may {{also be used for}} defense, as captive specimens have attempted to whip their keepers with their tails. This species is occasionally seen in the pet trade, but has earned a reputation of being aggressive and unpredictable. Although they are known to rest and bask in trees, they sleep on the ground or submerged in water.|$|E

25|$|Fines {{for animal}} welfare abuse {{prosecution}} are often directed {{to be paid}} to the SPCA, and the society often seeks the cost of food and veterinary bills from offenders during legal proceedings. The SPCA also has partnerships with various New Zealand businesses to generate funding. For example, pet store chain Animates has encouraged customers to make a donation to the SPCA in return for an ornament that they <b>can</b> <b>hang</b> on an in-store Christmas tree.|$|E
25|$|An early model which governed the {{allocation}} of time to programs was called cooperative multitasking. In this model, when control is passed to a program by the kernel, it may execute {{for as long as}} it wants before explicitly returning control to the kernel. This means that a malicious or malfunctioning program may not only prevent any other programs from using the CPU, but it <b>can</b> <b>hang</b> the entire system if it enters an infinite loop.|$|E
25|$|Men's kimono sleeves are {{attached}} to the body of the kimono with {{no more than a few}} inches unattached at the bottom, unlike the women's style of very deep sleeves mostly unattached from the body of the kimono. Men's sleeves are less deep than women's kimono sleeves to accommodate the obi around the waist beneath them, whereas on a woman's kimono, the long, unattached bottom of the sleeve <b>can</b> <b>hang</b> over the obi without getting in the way.|$|E

25|$|The {{ability of}} geckos – which <b>can</b> <b>hang</b> on a glass surface using only one toe – to climb on sheer {{surfaces}} has {{been attributed to}} the van der Waals forces between these surfaces and the spatulae, or microscopic projections, which cover the hair-like setae found on their footpads. A later study suggested that capillary adhesion might play a role, but that hypothesis has been rejected by more recent studies. There were efforts in 2008 to create a dry glue that exploits the effect, and success was achieved in 2011 to create an adhesive tape on similar grounds. In 2011, a paper was published relating the effect to both velcro-like hairs and the presence of lipids in gecko footprints.|$|E
500|$|Shelters are {{generally}} maintained by local volunteers.

500|$|The {{painting}} {{was commissioned by}} Eric Hall, Bacon's patron and, later, his lover, who in 1933, commissioned three crucifixion paintings. Bacon drew influence from the old masters Grünewald, Diego Velázquez and Rembrandt, as well as Picasso's late 1920s and early 1930s biomorphs. Bacon said that {{he thought of the}} crucifixion as a [...] "magnificent armature on which you <b>can</b> <b>hang</b> all types of feeling and sensation".|$|E
500|$|The {{greatest}} {{criticism of}} Youth and Pleasure came from The Morning Chronicle, a newspaper which had long disliked Etty's female nudes. It complained [...] "no decent family <b>can</b> <b>hang</b> such sights against their wall", and condemned the painting as an [...] "indulgence {{of what we}} once hoped a classical, but which are now convinced, is a lascivious mind", commenting [...] "the course of [...] studies should run in a purer channel, {{and that he should}} not persist, with an unhallowed fancy, to pursue Nature to her holy recesses. He is a laborious draughtsman, and a beautiful colourist; but he has not taste or chastity of mind enough to venture on the naked truth." [...] The reviewer added [...] "we fear that Mr.E will never turn from his wicked ways, and make himself fit for decent company." ...|$|E

500|$|William Clark of Guitar International {{gave the}} album a {{positive}} review, {{and said that}} the record features [...] "some of the most elaborate, expansive, and simply wowing guitar playing that Eddie has passionately poured into a single album". Spin wrote, [...] "the frantic, haute-for-teacher 'As Is' and the mid-tempo shoulda-been-the-single 'You and Your Blues' <b>can</b> <b>hang</b> with any heavy-breathing romp they made in their heyday." [...] Jerry Shriver of USA Today gave the album 3.5/4 stars, saying that [...] "this is the true kick in the butt that arena rock desperately needs." [...] However, in the newspaper's year-end retrospective, Edna Gundersen listed A Different Kind of Truth among the overrated albums of 2012, stating that [...] "the reheated meat-and-potato riffs of Van Halen's past had critics swooning and fans panting, but vanished from the charts after the band's tour was scrapped" [...] and the album deservedly got shut out of Grammy Award nominations. Guitar World picked A Different Kind of Truth as the best album of 2012. Rolling Stone named [...] "Stay Frosty" [...] the 16th best song of 2012, and the magazine's readers ranked it the fifth best album of the year.|$|E
500|$|Durian {{trees are}} large, growing to [...] in height {{depending}} on the species. The leaves are evergreen, elliptic to oblong and [...] long. The flowers are produced in three to thirty clusters together on large branches and directly on the trunk with each flower having a calyx (sepals) and five (rarely four or six) petals. Durian trees {{have one or two}} flowering and fruiting periods per year, although the timing varies {{depending on the}} species, cultivars, and localities. A typical durian tree can bear fruit after four or five years. The durian fruit <b>can</b> <b>hang</b> from any branch and matures roughly three months after pollination. The fruit can grow up to [...] long and [...] in diameter, and typically weighs one to three kilograms (2 to 7lb). Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale-yellow to red, depending on the species. Among the thirty known species of Durio, nine of them have been identified as producing edible fruits: D. zibethinus, D. dulcis, D. grandiflorus, D. graveolens, D. kutejensis, D. macrantha, D. oxleyanus and D. testudinarum. There are many species for which the fruit has never been collected or properly examined, however, so other species with edible fruit may exist. The durian is somewhat similar in appearance to the jackfruit, an unrelated species.|$|E

2500|$|All Naultinus species also possess very long, finely tapered, {{strongly}} prehensile tails {{which they}} {{use as a}} [...] "fifth limb" [...] for grasping when they climb among the twigs and leaves of their arboreal habitat. They <b>can</b> <b>hang</b> by their tails if necessary. They also have comparatively slender toes, another adaptation to their arboreal lifestyle. The arboreal Naultinus use their toes in a grasping action on twigs and leaves, {{but there is some}} lamellar function as well.|$|E
