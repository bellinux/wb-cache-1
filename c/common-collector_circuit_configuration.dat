25|$|The {{common emitter}} (or common source, common cathode, etc.) {{is most often}} {{configured}} to provide amplification of a voltage applied between base and emitter, and the output signal taken between collector and emitter is inverted, relative to the input. The common collector arrangement applies the input voltage between base and collector, and to take the output voltage between emitter and collector. This causes negative feedback, and the output voltage tends to follow the input voltage. This arrangement is also used as the input presents a high impedance and does not load the signal source, though the voltage amplification is less than one. The <b>common-collector</b> <b>circuit</b> is, therefore, better known as an emitter follower, source follower, or cathode follower.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 120 - 123). It {{was identified}} that potential improvements in recoveries {{were to be}} found in the better use of the regrind stages at a number of Anglo-Platinum concentrators. Historically, these concentrators used to operate in an open <b>circuit</b> <b>configuration,</b> over a relatively short period, the circuits were changed to closed <b>circuit</b> <b>configurations</b> because of the reported benefits of operating in this configuration. The effect of closing the circuit had, however not been quantified in these concentrators. This dissertation looks at quantifying the effects of each configuration with the purpose of drawing meaningful comparisons between them. The <b>circuit</b> <b>configurations</b> studied are open circuit, I-stage and 2 -stage closed <b>circuit</b> <b>configurations.</b> The primary difference between these configurations is the network of hydrocyclones. This study pays special attention to the effect of cyclone performance on the regrind circuit performance. Comparisons were made between the open and the 2 -stage closed circuits in three concentrators, and surprisingly the closed circuit did not show any improvement over the open <b>circuit</b> <b>configuration</b> from a combination efficiency perspective. The cyclones performance was analysed, and it was observed that the cyclones were operating inefficiently, most likely because the cyclones employed were not appropriate for regrind circuits. A further comparison was made between the I-stage and 2 -stage <b>circuit</b> <b>configurations</b> and the I-stage closed <b>circuit</b> <b>configuration</b> proved to be more efficient than the 2 -stage closed <b>circuit</b> <b>configuration.</b> Simulations were conducted to predict the performance of the <b>circuit</b> <b>configurations</b> by using more appropriate cyclones which are smaller in size. These cyclones are currently being used in a similar application in another concentrator. The simulations indicated that significant improvements in comminution performance could be realised with the utilisation of more appropriate cyclones, to achieve the closed <b>circuit</b> <b>configuration...</b>|$|R
