60|$|He {{looked in}} the {{direction}} in which she pointed, but at first he saw nothing. The wind was still behind them, and a brisk sea was running of a deep rich green colour, with long creamy <b>curling</b> <b>caps</b> to the larger waves. The breeze would catch these foam-crests from time to time, and then there would be a sharp spatter upon the decks, with a salt smack upon the lips, and a pringling in the eyes. Suddenly as he gazed, however, something black was tilted up upon the sharp summit of one of the seas, and swooped out of view again upon the further side. It was so far from him that he could make nothing of it, but sharper eyes than his had caught a glance of it. Amos Green had seen the girl point and observed what it was which had attracted her attention.|$|R
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Boletopsis nothofagi usually grow in tufts and only rarely individually. They have a {{centrally}} stalked cap. The cap is convex, measuring [...] wide and [...] high. In young specimens, the cap's edge is slightly bent, whereas the cap of older fruit bodies often <b>curl.</b> The <b>cap</b> cuticle is gray in color, and its texture ranges from smooth to slightly fibrous. Pressure- or scrape-spots are stained darker and eventually blacken.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He is very, very ill,' said Florence. 'But, Susan, dear, {{you must}} not speak to me as you used to speak. And what's this?' said Florence, {{touching}} her clothes, in amazement. 'Your old dress, dear? Your old <b>cap,</b> <b>curls,</b> and all?' ...|$|R

60|$|The {{moment the}} Fairy said those words, Prince Certainpersonio's face left off being stickey, and {{his jacket and}} corduroys changed to peach-bloom velvet, and his hair <b>curled,</b> and a <b>cap</b> and feather flew in like a bird and settled on his head. He got into the {{carriage}} by the Fairy's invitation, and there he renewed his acquaintance with the Duchess, whom he had seen before.|$|R
60|$|She {{could not}} help seeing, however, that the crisp brown hair under {{the edges of the}} unclerical-looking <b>cap</b> <b>curled</b> around a remarkably well-shaped forehead, beneath which flashed out a pair of very fine dark-grey eyes; he had {{likewise}} a good mouth, which was resolute and looked as if it might be stubborn on occasion; and, although he was not exactly handsome, Frances decided that she liked his face.|$|R
60|$|If {{we could}} shut {{our eyes to}} the two sisters sitting here in woe, this would be, to the male eye at least, the {{identical}} blue and white room of ten years ago; the same sun shining into it and playing familiarly with Miss Susan's treasures. But the ladies are changed. It is not merely that Miss Phoebe has again donned her schoolmistress's gown and hidden her <b>curls</b> under the <b>cap.</b> To see her thus once more, her real self, after the escapade of the ball, is not unpleasant, and the cap and gown do not ill become the quiet room. But she now turns guiltily from the sun {{that used to be}} her intimate, her face is drawn, her form condensed into the smallest space, and her hands lie trembling in her lap. It is disquieting to note that any life there is in the room comes not from her but from Miss Susan. If the house were to go on fire now it would be she who would have to carry out Miss Phoebe.|$|R
5000|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Cortinarius camphoratus have a cap that is {{initially}} convex before flattening out, sometimes developing a broad umbo; the diameter ranges from 4 to 10 cm. Initially <b>curled</b> inwards, the <b>cap</b> margin uncurls as the mushroom matures. The cap, which {{is covered with}} minute fibers matted on the surface, is buff with tints of lilac, although golden tones typically develop in age. The flesh, colored lilac to purple, has no distinctive taste, and an odor that {{has been compared to}} [...] "curry powder, rotting meat, old goats or goat's cheese, cold mashed potato, burnt horn, or sweaty feet." [...] The gills have an adnate attachment to the stipe; they are initially pale lilac when young, but become rusty-brown as the spores mature. The stipe measures 5 to 10 cm long by 1 to 2 cm wide, and thickens towards the base. Roughly the same color as the cap, it is solid (i.e., not hollow), and covered with silky white matted fibrils up {{to the level of the}} annular zone. The latter feature is formed when the cobwebby white partial veil collapses on the stipe. There is general disagreement about the edibility of the mushroom: it has been described as edible, inedible, or somewhat poisonous. It is generally not recommended for consumption.|$|R
