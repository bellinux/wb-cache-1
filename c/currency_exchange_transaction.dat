The analysis is principally based on cointegration techniques. This paper is the fi rst attempt to estimate the infl uence of a currency transaction tax on the foreign exchange market volume trading. The econometric estimations suggest that the forex trading volume could be signifi cantly reduced by a Tobin tax. Nevertheless, elasticities are heterogeneous with respect to the currency pairs: the largest elasticities are the euro/dollar and sterling/dollar currency pairs that are also the most traded exchange parities.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{response}} of inflation to external shocks is very different when the authorities target the real exchange rate than when they follow a fixed exchange rate or a preannounced crawling peg. Specifically, shocks that would {{have no effect on}} the steady-state inflation rate under a fixed exchange rate are either inflationary or deflationary under a real exchange rate rule. Moreover, irrespective of the degree of capital mobility, the authorities will find it difficult to mitigate the destabilizing effects of real shocks on the price level by using monetary policy, except possibly in the very short run.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} {{of foreign exchange}} (FX) swaps {{as a source of}} funding and as a hedging tool has focused attention {{on the role of the}} FX swap market in the recent crisis. The turbulence in international money markets spilled over into the FX swap market in the second-half of 2007 and into 2008, giving rise to concerns over the ability of banks to roll over their funding requirements and manage their liquidity risk. The turmoil also raised questions about banks'' ability to continue their supply of credit to the local economy, as well as the external financing gap it could create. In this paper, we examine the channels through which FX swap transactions could affect a country''s financial and economic stability, and highlight the strategies central banks can employ to mitigate market pressures. While not offering any judgment on the instrument itself, we show that the use of FX swaps for funding and hedging purposes is not infallible, especially during periods of market stress.

40|$|Policymakers in many {{emerging}} markets {{are attempting to}} resist currency appreciation while simultaneously meeting targets for inflation. Using the recent experience of Colombia between 2004 and 2007, this paper examines {{the effectiveness of the}} Central Bank''s intervention in stemming domestic currency appreciation under an inflation targeting regime. The results indicate that exchange rate intervention was effective during 2004 - 2006, when foreign currency purchases were undertaken during a period of monetary easing. During 2007, on the other hand, intervention was ineffective in reversing or slowing down domestic currency appreciation, as large-scale intervention became incompatible with meeting the inflation target in an overheating economy. Currency derivative markets-which have grown in depth and sophistication-played a key role in blunting the effectiveness of intervention.

40|$|Based on {{evidence}} {{obtained from the}} IMF''s 2001 Survey on Foreign Exchange Market Organization, the author argues that, for several reasons, some central banks in developing and transition economies {{may be able to}} conduct foreign exchange intervention more effectively than the central banks of developed countries issuing the major international currencies. First, these central banks do not always fully sterilize their foreign exchange interventions. In addition, they issue regulations and conduct their foreign exchange operations in a way that increases the central bank''s information advantage and the size of their foreign exchange intervention relative to foreign exchange market turnover. Some of the central banks also use moral suasion to support their foreign exchange interventions.

The thesis introduces a function of fiscal policy, a creation of <b>currency</b> <b>exchange</b> rate and describes an environment of <b>exchange</b> market. <b>Currency</b> <b>exchange</b> rate is stable on its market defined value in the long term.

The second aim of the thesis is to analyze an impact of government debt on development of <b>currency</b> <b>exchange</b> rate, mainly are analyzed the Czech republic, Great Britain and some other selected countries of the European union.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a monthly database on de facto exchange rate regimes that covers all IMF members since 1990. Information from IMF country reports and other sources, including exchange rate data, is utilized to determine de facto exchange rate policies. Countries are categorized {{based on these}} policies using the IMF nomenclature adopted in 1999. This approach ensures the forward compatibility of the database. The database is then used to examine whether the "bipolar view" of exchange regimes holds with de facto regimes. It is found {{that the proportion of}} countries adopting "intermediate" regimes has indeed been shrinking in favor of greater flexibility or greater fixity, especially for countries more integrated with international markets. Analyses based on Markov chains of regime transitions, however, provide (mixed) evidence against the bipolar view.

All of these would have to be taxed together under a [...] "non-currency" [...] financial transactions tax (such as under certain proposals in the U.S. in 2009 which, although not intending to tax currencies directly, would still do so due to taxation of currency futures and <b>currency</b> <b>exchange</b> traded funds).
