5|$|Soon after Flight 825 took off, a {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas scored a hit on its {{starboard}} wing with a Soviet-made Strela-2 surface-to-air infrared homing missile, critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing. An attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of Karoi was foiled by a ditch, which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up. Of the 52 passengers and four crew, 38 died in the crash; the insurgents then approached the wreckage, rounded up the 10 survivors they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> massacred them with automatic gunfire. Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush, while a further five lived because {{they had gone to}} look for water before the guerrillas arrived.|$|E
5|$|Paja Jovanović (1859–1957) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} Serbian realist painters of the late 19th century. During his early career, he came to be identified with Orientalist painting, depicting scenes from the Balkans, which were then under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Between 1877 and 1882, he attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, where he came under the mentorship of painting instructors Christian Griepenkerl and Leopold Müller. Griepenkerl taught the young Jovanović the underlying structural principles of Renaissance and Baroque art, thus helping him better understand spatial problems and the arrangement of large numbers of figures, both moving and static. Müller encouraged Jovanović to take a naturalist approach to painting, recording only what he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> relying as little as possible on his imagination. It was in this context that Müller instructed Jovanović to make direct studies of Balkan life during his visits home, purposely steering him towards Orientalist painting.|$|E

25|$|Questions {{were raised}} {{on why the}} SS Uganda {{did not come to}} give {{assistance}} when the distress rockets were fired. The captain of the ship, Captain Kilpatrick, stated that he thought the lights were from Troubridge Island Lighthouse, and were not distress signals; as a result, he continue on according to procedure. This excuse was challenged {{by the fact that the}} locals nearby <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> identify the lights as distress signals. Furthermore, one of the survivors stated that the SS Uganda did answer the distress signal by replying with an answering light. This suggests that they knew what it was but did not came to help them.|$|E

25|$|Huxley was {{certainly}} not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, {{so there was a}} difference in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection {{was the best way to}} explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>and</b> some things are not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right.|$|E
25|$|Gasparotto and Moduco {{would not}} be the only victims of Montefalco's investigations, however, for during late 1581 he had heard of a widow living in Udine named Anna la Rossa. While she did not claim to be a benandante, she did claim that she <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> {{communicate}} with the spirits of the dead, and so Montefalco had her brought in for questioning on 1 January 1582. Initially denying that she had such an ability to the inquisitor, she eventually relented and told him of how she believed that she could see the dead, and how she sold their messages to members of the local community willing to pay, using the money in order to alleviate the poverty of her family. Although Montefalco intended to interrogate her again at a later date, the trial ultimately remained permanently unfinished.|$|E
25|$|Bernhardt made {{a two-year}} world tour (1891–1893) to {{replenish}} her finances. Upon returning to Paris, she paid 700,000 francs for the Théâtre de la Renaissance, and from 1893 until 1899, was its artistic director and lead actress. She managed {{every aspect of}} the theater, from the finances to the lighting, sets, and costumes, as well as appearing in eight performances a week. She imposed a rule that women in the audience, no matter how wealthy or famous, had to take off their hats during performances, so the rest of the audience <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>and</b> eliminated the prompter's box from the stage, declaring that actors should know their lines. She abolished in her theater the common practice of hiring claqueurs in the audience to applaud stars. She used the new technology of lithography to produce vivid color posters, and in 1894, she hired Czech artist Alphonse Mucha to design {{the first of a series}} of posters for her play Gismonda. He continued to make posters of her for six years.|$|E

25|$|On 14 July 1827 Guerrero sailed from Havana for Africa. Her {{departure}} {{was noted}} (along {{with that of}} several other suspected slave ships) by British commissioners in Havana. About 700 Africans, some of whom may have been forcibly taken from other slave ships, were on Guerrero when it sailed from Africa for Cuba. On 19 December 1827 Guerrero was sailing south towards Cuba in the Florida Straits carrying 561 Africans who had survived the voyage when it was spotted by HMS Nimble near Orange Cay (on the Great Bahama Bank). Nimble was smaller and more lightly armed (crew of 56, with, by various reports, eight, five or just three guns) than Guerrero. Nimble fired two shots to order the suspected slave ship to stop for inspection, but Guerrero ran, starting a five-hour chase during which the weather turned bad and night came on. As Nimble closed {{the distance between the}} ships they commenced firing at each other. The crew on the lightship Caesar, stationed on Carysfort Reef near Key Largo, <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> hear the battle, which appeared to be about ten miles away.|$|E
500|$|Typically, {{there were}} two dog {{trainers}} on the set, each teetering on a stepladder only Lassie <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> waving a chunk of meat at the dog. [...] "It would look as though Lassie was looking at Jon (Provost), but he was really looking past Jon at the piece of beef", Lockhart recalled in 2004. When Provost delivered his line, the trainer behind Lockhart would whisper [...] "Lassie!" [...] and wave another piece of meat. Lassie's head would turn to Lockhart who would deliver her line. Then the trainer behind Provost would get Lassie's attention again, and Provost would deliver his next line. [...] "The sound editor would cut out all that," [...] Lockhart said, [...] "You finally got to where you never heard the trainers. Often, if the scene had gone well, and maybe we hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it." [...] In addition to the main Lassie, three other Lassies might be involved in an episode shoot: a stand-in for rehearsals, a stunt double, and a [...] "fighter" [...] for scenes involving battles with other animals.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to launch, the Missile Tracking Radar (MTR) {{locked on}} to the {{transponder}} in the selected missile. Like the Ajax, the Hercules used a transponder in the missile. A short period after launch the actual location, i.e. azimuth, elevation and range of the missile were displayed on the plotting boards. The firing or launch command was given manually by the Battery Control Officer based on orders or Rules of Engagements. To ensure the MTR <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> track the missile during its initial rapid assent as it launched, the IFC was normally located about [...] from the [...] "Launching Area" [...] (LA). In the case of Hercules, all of the radars were typically mounted on (concrete) elevated platforms to improve their line-of-sight.|$|E
2500|$|At 18:40, {{suddenly}} and for no immediately apparent reason, Villaret ordered his ships to haul their wind and turn {{back towards the}} east, breaking off contact. By the time the sun set a few hours later, the French had almost disappeared over the eastern horizon as the British continued westwards. Although the order to abandon the action has subsequently been much debated, the cause of Villaret's retreat {{was in fact the}} actions of the frigate Phaeton, which Cornwallis had sent ahead of the squadron as a scout early on 17 June. After progressing several miles ahead of the British squadron, Stopford had signalled that there were unknown sails to the northwest, followed by signals indicating four ships in sight and then one for a full fleet, highlighted by firing two cannon. Stopford had been careful to ensure that the French ships <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>and</b> read his signals, which were in a code that the French were known to have broken, and Villaret knew well that the only French fleet in those waters was the one he led. He therefore assumed that Phaeton could see the Channel Fleet beyond the northern horizon, a force significantly more powerful than his own. Stopford compounded the ruse at 15:00 by making a string of nonsensical signals to the non-existent fleet before notifying Cornwallis at 16:30, again in plain sight, that the fleet was composed of allied ships of the line. He completed the operation by raising the Dutch flag [...] and signalling for the non-existent fleet to join with Cornwallis. It is not clear to what extent Villaret was taken in by this charade, the French fleet continuing their attack without pause, until at 18:00 when a number of sails appeared on the northwest horizon. At this point Phaeton wore round to return to Cornwallis, and Villaret, now convinced that the strangers, which were in reality a small convoy of merchant vessels, were the vanguard of the Channel Fleet, abandoned the chase.|$|E
