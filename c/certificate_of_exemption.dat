50|$|The Vaccination Act of 1898 {{purported to}} give liberty of non-vaccination, but this liberty {{was not really}} obtained. Parents {{applying}} for a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>exemption</b> had to satisfy two magistrates, or one stipendiary, of their conscientious objections. Some stipendiaries, {{and many of the}} magistrates, refused to be satisfied, and imposed delays. Unless the exemption was obtained before the child was four months old, it was too late. The consequence was that in the year 1906, only about 40,000 exemptions were obtained in England and Wales. In the year 1907 the Government recognised that the magistrates had practically declined to carry out the law of 1898, and, consequently, a new law—the Vaccination Act, 1907 (7 Edw. VII) was passed. Under this law the parent escaped penalties for the non-vaccination of his child if within four months from the birth he made a statutory declaration that he confidently believed that vaccination would be prejudicial {{to the health of the}} child, and within seven days thereafter delivered, or sent by post, the declaration to the Vaccination Officer of the district.|$|E

Potential barristers must complete the Bar Professional Training Course (formerly Bar Vocational Course), followed by a year of vocational training known as a pupillage and be member of the four prestigious Inns of Court. Potential solicitors are required to complete the Legal Practice Course which lasts one year, then a two-year apprenticeship under a training contract, during which the trainee solicitor has to complete a Professional Skills Course. There are legal executives, whose primary role is to provide assistance to solicitors in law firms. Legal executives may charge for works done for both contentious and non-contentious matters, but should not be confused with qualified lawyers (i.e. solicitors and barristers).
