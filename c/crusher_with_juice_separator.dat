50|$|If the Hider failed a challenge, {{they were}} given a forfeit for the {{children}} to win back the prizes. In Series One, it was 'Suck the Sock' where the hider had to suck a sock full of smoothie to win the prizes back. Sometimes the sock was changed to another thing associated with the celebrity. For example, for Steph Orleans and Malak it became 'Lick the sock'. In Series Two, the forfeit was sometimes Lick the Tache, where they had to lick a horrible substance moustache off their face.An example of this is Aulona Xhema in Week 3 when she had to lick a moustache of tartar sauce off her face. In certain episodes, it was still 'Suck the Sock'. However, there was only one forfeit per episode and that was taken on the first failed challenge.It wasn't always a smoothie that was to be sucked - sometimes it was gravy but modified or <b>crushed</b> lollipops <b>with</b> orange <b>juice</b> and ginger.|$|R

2500|$|Plants used {{to treat}} snakebites in Trinidad and Tobago are made into tinctures with alcohol or olive oil and kept in rum flasks called 'snake bottles'. Snake bottles contain several {{different}} plants and/or insects. The plants used include the vine called monkey ladder (Bauhinia cumanensis or Bauhinia excisa, Fabaceae) which is pounded {{and put on the}} bite. Alternatively a tincture is made with a piece of the vine and kept in a snake bottle. [...] Other plants used include: mat root (Aristolochia rugosa), cat's claw (Pithecellobim unguis-cati), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), snake bush (Barleria lupulina), obie seed (Cola nitida), and wild gri gri root (Acrocomia aculeata). Some snake bottles also contain the caterpillars (Battus polydamas, Papilionidae) that eat tree leaves (Aristolochia trilobata). Emergency snake medicines are obtained by chewing a three-inch piece of the root of bois canôt (Cecropia peltata) and administering this chewed-root solution to the bitten subject (usually a hunting dog). This is a common native plant of Latin America and the Caribbean which makes it appropriate as an emergency remedy. Another native plant used is mardi gras (Renealmia alpinia)(berries), which are <b>crushed</b> together <b>with</b> the <b>juice</b> of wild cane (Costus scaber) and given to the bitten. Quick fixes have included applying chewed tobacco from cigarettes, cigars or pipes. Making cuts around the puncture or sucking out the venom had been thought helpful in the past, but this course of treatment is now strongly discouraged, due to the risk of self-envenomation through knife cuts or cuts in the mouth (suction cups from snake bite kits can be used, but suctioning seldom provides any measurable benefit).|$|R

40|$|Dysphagia, often {{associated}} with conditions such as stroke, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and dementia, causes patients to have difficulty with swallowing food and/or liquids. These patients require their fluids to be thickened using gum-based thickening powders {{in order to facilitate}} safe swallowing. These thickened fluids are also used as a vehicle for delivery of crushed medicines. Our in vitro measurements suggest that thickened fluids can delay and reduce the dissolution of a number of medications. This study was conducted {{to assess the impact of}} the use of thickened fluids on the clinical pharmacokinetics of oral paracetamol. METHODS 20 Healthy volunteers were administered a single oral dose (1 g) of paracetamol as either whole tablets, <b>crushed</b> <b>with</b> water, <b>crushed</b> <b>with</b> semi-solid jam, or <b>crushed</b> <b>with</b> thickened fluid according to a randomised, crossover design. Saliva samples were collected periodically over 8 hr and paracetamol concentration analysed by HPLC-UV. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using Winnonlin®. RESULTS The mean peak concentration (Cmax) of paracetamol ranged between 5. 62 – 8. 00 μg/mL. Comparison between the <b>crushed</b> paracetamol <b>with</b> thickened water (Level 900) and other treatment options (whole, <b>crushed</b> <b>with</b> water, and <b>crushed</b> <b>with</b> jam) showed there was a significant difference in Cmax at 90...|$|R
