Few residents take the money. Public hearings are announced. The City Executive Committee announces their own revised intention to preserve 4 buildings on MacKay Street, the La Fontaine House and four triplexes on Overdale Street. They will allow demolition of the Kinkora-Cadillac Apts and all the greystone houses on Kinkora Avenue. The hearings open for two evenings before a committee of City Councillors.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to map various types of anaphor to the {{centering}} transitions in the corpus of Serbian newspaper articles. Centering Theory (WALKER, JOSHI ET AL. 1998) is a theory of local coherence in which four types of transitions are used as parameters of coherence. As is hypothesized in the previous literature based on various languages, the <b>CONTINUE</b> <b>transition</b> is mostly characterized by a minimal form (a zero form of the topic), while the SMOOTH and ROUGH shifts are found with a full noun phrase topic. The analysis shows that the “Ordering Rule” of Centering Theory is not fully followed in the written corpus of the Serbian language since SMOOTH SHIFT {{has been identified as}} a prevalent type of transition in the corpus. The following two reasons were identified for that: (1) the genre of the newspaper articles, and (2) the way clauses are combined within a complex sentence in the Serbian written corpus...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{countries}} of Central and Eastern Europe {{have experienced a}} lot of changes {{at the end of the}} 20 th century, including changes in the health care systems and especially in primary care. The aim of this paper is to systematically assess the position of family medicine in these countries, using the same methodology within all the countries. Methods A key informants survey in 11 Central and Eastern European countries and Russia using a questionnaire developed on the basis of systematic literature review. Results Formally, family medicine is accepted as a specialty in all the countries, although the levels of its implementation vary across the countries and the differences are important. In most countries, solo practice is the most predominant organisational form of family medicine. Family medicine is just one of many medical specialties (e. g. paediatrics and gynaecology) in primary health care. Full introduction of family medicine was successful only in Estonia. Conclusions Some of the unification of the systems may have been the result of the EU request for adequate training that has pushed the policies towards higher standards of training for family medicine. The initial enthusiasm of implementing family medicine has decreased because there was no initiative that would support this movement. Internal and external stimuli might be needed to <b>continue</b> <b>transition</b> process. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the difference in}} interpretation between null and overt third person singular pronouns in subject position in Romanian from a Centering perspective (Grosz and Sidner 1986, Grosx et al. 1995, Brennan et al. 1987). Our goal is to verify two hypotheses. First, we argue that the null pronoun is preferred over the overt one when it co-refers with {{the center of the}} previous sentence. Secondly, we claim that null pronouns are generally used in <b>Continue</b> <b>transitions,</b> while overt subjects occur in Shift transitions. The conclusion shows that, in Romanian, the null pronoun encodes the most prominent entity of the preceding utterance which has been identified with the subject in most of the cases discussed. The general tendency of null pronouns to appear in <b>Continue</b> <b>transitions</b> has also been verified, although we have also found situations in which overt forms are used to mark continuity...|$|R

The <b>continued</b> <b>transition</b> from the Lorenz and the Chen systems is controlled by |x|, thereby the new attractor is composed by two parts, one part is half a Lorenz attractor, another part is half a Chen attractor. The dynamical behavior of the new unified system is investigated. An electronic circuit is also designed and built to confirm its dynamics of the new chaotic system.

The simulation results demonstrate a series of novel <b>continues</b> <b>transitions,</b> in which both long-range hexatic and herringbone orderings are established simultaneously.

5|$|The first National Hurricane Center {{forecast}} on Nicole {{noted the}} development of convection over the western portion of the center, and that if the trend <b>continued,</b> <b>transitioning</b> into a tropical cyclone would be possible. The first discussion also predicted a peak intensity of 65mph (105km/h). A mid-level trough turned the storm northeastward, and early on October 11 it passed about 60miles (95km) northwest of Bermuda. Shortly after passing Bermuda, Nicole developed persistent deep convection near the center, while Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit overpasses indicated the potential of a warm core within the system. Though Nicole attempted to acquire tropical characteristics, strong upper-level wind shear prevented the transition. As the storm accelerated northeastward {{under the influence of}} a large extratropical storm south of Nova Scotia, it briefly reached peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). Subtropical Storm Nicole lost its circulation as it was absorbed by the larger extratropical storm on October 11.|$|R

Evidence that a major transformation of academic libraries is underway continues to mount. We will examine this by reviewing how libraries are expanding the scope and nature of their collections; integrating information resources with applied learning experiences; facilitating researcher collaboration; and completely rethinking collections and access. Finally, we will look at how libraries have been leveraging data to implement sustainable collection practices, which are critical to creating the space, both figuratively and literally, to transform libraries...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} inclusive practices in Prince Edward Island (PEI) elemen-tary schools {{in terms of}} the supports teachers consider as important for inclusion. Twenty teachers were randomly selected to complete a survey, and 5 teachers were randomly selected to participate in an interview about inclusion supports. The survey in this study adapted The School and the Education of All Students Scale. Participants identified and ranked several supports that they deemed im-portant for successful inclusion. The results indicated that elementary teachers in PEI consider certain supports as important when planning an inclusive class-room, such as class size, curriculum and planning time, training, and other incentives. In light of PEI’s <b>continued</b> <b>transition</b> in Special Education services, such results provided insight into specific recommendations. The identified teach-er supports necessitate acknowledgement and understanding by teachers, parents, school boards, government, and teacher-training programs to ensure inclusive practices are implemented effectively in the PEI school system...|$|R

40|$|In the {{turbulent}} environment of media convergence, public service broadcasting [PSB] organisations are expected {{not only to}} produce quality content but also to take risks and lead {{in the pursuit of}} innovation. This poses a significant challenge in the <b>continuing</b> <b>transition</b> to public service media [PSM] 1, which is largely what convergence means in practice for the public sector. Convergence is about cross-boundaries, blurring them and perhaps even erasing. This is about administrative and production practices, but also importantly about learning new ways of thinking. That is not simple or easy for organisations that are typically big, old and traditional. There is a heritage of doing things differently than the commercial sector, but reluctance to do things differently than the internally developed heritage. This creates enormous challenges for bridging the various elements that must be bridged to secure innovation. This paper is about those challenges. The focus is on crossing boundaries to achieve innovation within and for PSM content development...|$|R
