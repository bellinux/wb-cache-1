40|$|The electroreduction of {{molybdate}} {{and subsequent}} electro-oxidation on glassy carbon electrodes was studied by cyclic voltammetry in acid medium. The {{results show that}} the reduction of molybdate depends on applied potential and molybdate concentration in solution. The molybdate reduction process is characterized by cathodic peaks Ic (- 0. 143 mV), IIc (- 0. 270 mV) and the cathodic band (Bc) around- 400 mV. Cathodic peaks Ic and IIc correspond to the early stages of reduction of molybdate. Both peaks show some degree of reversibility with respect to the anodic peaks Ia and IIa. As the <b>cathode</b> <b>switching</b> potential is more negative than- 400 mV and the concentration of molybdate increases, the band Bc is the dominant factor in the reduction process, resulting {{in the formation of the}} anodic peaks IIIa (- 217 mV) and IVa (477 mV) on voltammogram. This behaviour can be justified through the formation and oxidation of hydrogen molybdenum bronzes on the surface of glassy carbon...|$|R
40|$|The program {{addressed}} {{fundamental issues}} in pulsed power technology, emphasizing new GaAs based solid state switches, and new high power thyratron type switches. Results included demonstration of a fast GaAs-based vertical FET-type switch for power modulator, radar and microwave applications, {{and development of}} super-emissive <b>cathode</b> <b>switches.</b> Transition of this research to technology is discussed first, then summaries {{of some of the}} recent activity are presented. Technology transitions from the research include initiation of a small business in the area of pulsed power technology, substantial impact on modem high power thyratron technololgy, "and impact on the development of solid state devices, including GaAs-based structures. Ongoing work that is related to technology transfer includes development of electron beams for fusion (electron beam ion trap), accelerator and microlithography applications, and development of cathodes with ultra-high emission properties (super-emissive cathode). 14.

50|$|The EBM beam is {{operated}} in pulse mode. This {{is achieved by}} appropriately biasing the biased grid located just after the <b>cathode.</b> <b>Switching</b> pulses are given to the bias grid so as to achieve pulse duration of as low as 50 μs to as long as 15 ms.Beam current {{is directly related to}} the number of electrons emitted by the cathode or available in the beam. Beam current once again can be as low as 200 μamp to 1 amp.Increasing the beam current directly increases the energy per pulse. Similarly, increase in pulse duration also enhances energy per pulse. High-energy pulses (in excess of 100 J/pulse) can machine larger holes on thicker plates.The energy density and power density is governed by energy per pulse duration and spot size. Spot size, on the other hand is controlled by the degree of focusing achieved by the electromagnetic lenses. If a higher energy density is combined with a smaller spot size, the material removal would be faster though the size of the hole would be smaller.The plane of focusing would be on or just beneath the surface of the work piece. The electron beam is generated by the potential difference between the negatively-charged cathode and the positively-charged anode.|$|R
40|$|Fast {{high current}} and voltage {{switches}} {{are very important}} tools for pulsed power applications. They have for example applications in accelerator laboratories to drive fast injection- and extraction magnets, beam dumps and in quadrupole lenses. Basically, there are two complete different principles used to realise a high power switches. One {{is based on the}} use of semiconductors, where as the other is based on a triggered breakdown in gases or in vacuum. Now this contribution gives an introduction in a new kind of gas discharge switch, which consists of a coaxial electrode geometry. Initially the inner electrode serves as anode, the outer as <b>cathode.</b> This <b>switch</b> device is called, based on its underlying effect, as Lorentz Drift Switch (LDS) and works usually with a cold cathode...|$|R

As {{compared to the}} prototype (YPT- 1 accelerator), the layout of assemblies is changed in it, allowing one to place it in rooms with heights up to 2. 5 m. It uses Murata capacitors and a TQPEe Cyrillic sign 1 - 10 k/ 75 thyratron with a cold <b>cathode</b> for <b>switching.</b> The computer-aided parameter-monitoring system is created. A metal-ceramic cathode consisting of several elements with ∼ 15 % nonuniform current density distribution of the electron beam on the exit foil was used to obtain an electron beam with a width of up to 400 mm.

40|$|Innovative coatings, {{need to be}} {{investigated}} and understood {{by the use of}} a lot of different techniques; a huge amount of interest is concerned with the use of microscopy techniques due to: semi-quantitative elemental analyses coupled with morphological characterization, extended up to wide regions of interest and tracking while rising up magnification (from LM up to TEM resolution); low cost and quick response if proper sample preparation is used also for standard SEM analyses. Two case studies of combined LM, SEM, TEM, SPM and related techniques are presented. The first one is an example of thick coating and is related to the determination of microstructures and nano-phases obtained during the deposition of UHTC ZrB 2 -SiC composite mixture by Inert Plasma Spray (IPS). The use of ZrB 2 -SiC mixtures is aimed to promote the formation of a stable silica based oxides in order to protect ZrB 2 from oxidation. Due to the lack of a stable liquid phase, these type of mixtures were supposed not to be suitable for plasma spraying. However, sample produced with this technique showed an almost complete retention of SiC within the sprayed deposit. Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy (BF, DF, SAD and Nanoprobe) were used to investigate coating microstructure and composition aimed to correlate mechanical properties (eg. toughness, hardness, wear behaviour) to IPS process parameters. The second one {{is an example of a}} thin coating and is related to the production of CrN/NbN superlattice coatings by <b>Cathode</b> <b>Switching</b> Reactive Cathodic Arc Evaporation (the term superlattice indicate a particular case of multilayer film that is a repeated layered structure of two materials with nanometric scale dimensions). High hardness and high fracture resistance as well as an improved corrosion resistance and decreased abrasive and erosive wear rates due to superlattice coatings are reported in literature for both metallic-ceramic and ceramicceramic couples, and their properties are strongly dependent on their nano/micro structure, especially on layers period. Also surface defects, formed during deposition, change in number and properties and this can be a further reason for the improved mechanical performances. Several microscopy and related Image Analysis techniques were used in this case study to characterize coating and its defects. Latter was investigated focussing on shape, dimension, density, clustering and other process-sensitive features. In CrN/NbN superlattice coatings a separation between defects and the surrounding bulk coating was evident, in fact SEM analysis revealed a different microstructure and chemical composition in this area...|$|R
40|$|A radial {{multichannel}} pseudopark switch seems advantageous {{for switching}} currents exceeding 100 kA. A single common hollow cathode guarantees same tigger conditions for all channels. The electron beams emitted {{out of the}} hollow <b>cathode</b> of this <b>switch</b> are analyzed by means of Faraday-cups by varying the circuit {{as well as the}} trigger parameters. In addition to the cup measuremnts, the discharge is observed using a CCD camera. It is found that each channel of the Switch must receive a respective beam, before the restistance of the switch turns low, if the discharge current is to run through that channel. In addition, most of the varied parameters do not influence the electron beam...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{applications}} of pulsed power technology pose growing requirements for pulse generators (lifetime > 10 " 6 pulses, repetition rate > 1 Hz, current rise > 10 " 1 " 1 A/s, peak current > 100 kA). High current switches are the weakest components concerning {{the lifetime of}} those generators. In this project a new concept for multichannel pseudospark switches was realized. It {{is characterized by the}} channels being oriented radically around one common hollow <b>cathode.</b> Its <b>switching</b> properties and wear up to 500 kA peak current were investigated. A maximum current rise of 4. 3 "* 10 " 1 " 1 A/s is achieved, which is only limited by the generator's other components. Up to the investigated peak currents of 100 kA per channel only cathode spots with < 10 #mu#m on stainless steel and < 1 #mu#m on molybdenum electrodes appear. These spots indicate low erosion of the electrodes, as related investigations of vacuum sparks confer. In the pseudospark switch the material loss at the electrodes after 180. 000 pulses at 200 kA peak current with up to 2 Hz repetition rate (200. 000 As total charge transfer) is less than 10 "-" 8 cm" 3 /pulse, which is more than two orders of magnitude below that of spark gaps.

5000|$|Eugen Goldstein {{thought he}} had figured out a method of {{measuring}} the speed of cathode rays. If the glow discharge seen in the gas of Crookes tubes was produced by the moving cathode rays, the light radiated from them in the direction they were moving, down the tube, would be shifted in frequency due to the Doppler effect. This could be detected with a spectroscope because the emission line spectrum would be shifted. He built a tube shaped like an [...] "L", with a spectroscope pointed through {{the glass of the}} elbow down one of the arms. He measured the spectrum of the glow when the spectroscope was pointed toward the <b>cathode</b> end, then <b>switched</b> the power supply connections so the cathode became the anode and the electrons were moving in the other direction, and again observed the spectrum looking for a shift. He did not find one, which he calculated meant that the rays were traveling very slowly. It is now recognized that the glow in Crookes tubes is emitted from gas atoms hit by the electrons, not the electrons themselves. Since the atoms are thousands of times more massive than the electrons, they move much slower, accounting for the lack of Doppler shift.|$|R
40|$|Efficient, inexpensive, {{and stable}} {{electrode}} materials are {{key components of}} commercially viable electrochemical wastewater treatment system. In this study, blue-black TiO_ 2 nanotube array (BNTA) electrodes are prepared by electrochemical self-doping. The 1 -D structure, donor state density, and Fermi energy level position are critical for maintaining the semimetallic functionality of the BNTA. The structural strength of the BNTA is enhanced by surface crack minimization, reinforcement of the BNTA-Ti metal interface, and stabilized by a protective overcoating with nanoparticulate TiO_ 2 (Ti/EBNTA). Ti/EBNTA electrodes are employed as both anodes and <b>cathodes</b> with polarity <b>switching</b> at a set frequency. Oxidants are generated at the anode, while the doping levels are regenerated along with byproduct reduction at the cathode. The estimated maximum electrode lifetime is 16   895 h. Ti/EBNTA has comparable hydroxyl radical production activity (6. 6 × 10 ^(– 14) M) with boron-doped diamond (BDD, 7. 4 × 10 ^(– 14) M) electrodes. The chlorine production rate follows a trend with respective to electrode type of Ti/EBNTA > BDD > IrO_ 2. Ti/EBNTA electrodes operated in a bipolar mode have a minimum energy consumption of 62 kWh/kg COD, reduced foam formation due to less gas bubble production, minimum scale formation, and lower chlorate production levels (6 mM vs 18 mM for BDD) during electrolytic wastewater treatment...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The effect of {{the configuration of the}} confining magnetic field on the operating characteristics of a planar magnetron has been observed. In particular, the heat load and charged particle bombardment of the substrate were measured. A circular planar magnetron was constructed with a magnetic field which could be controlled by the adjustment of the current flowing through coils placed around the circumference and with a separate supply feeding a coil around the centre pole. This allowed the magnetic field configuration to be unbalanced and caused the negative glow plasma to be incident on the substrate. It was found that the "unbalanced" electrically-controlled model could give six times the heat load to a substrate in comparison with a balanced permanent magnet structure. Such a load resulted from the bombardment of the substrate with the plasma (revealed by the measurement of the I-V characteristics), and gave a 30 volt negative bias as well as saturated electron and ion currents of around 90 and 1 mA respectively (a magnetron operating current: 0. 8 A). The heat load was lkWm⁻². This compared to a 1 volt positive bias with current of 1. 4 and 0. 5 mA for the balanced case. This bombardment was used as a neutralised ion beam to enhance film growth during sputtering. The effect of the magnetic field configuration has been observed on the operating characteristics of a planar magnetron. In particular, the deposition rate, the currents to a probe and heat load, {{as a function of the}} outer pole solenoid current, were measured. The deposition rate/input power was constant at 19 mÅ/s/W, independent of the outer pole solenoid current. In the region from 20 to 40 A of the outer pole solenoid current, the configuration of the magnetic field seemed to be concentric and the electrons were confined by it. But from 40 to 80 A, the magnetic field became dispersed outwards along the direction to the magnetron and the electrons followed it. Consequently, following bombardment of the surface by electrons and neutralising ions, the currents to a probe and the heat load, gave a behaviour. The effect of the pressure has been observed on probe current, floating potential and heat load. With the pressure increasing, they decreased. It seems that the mean free path of particles becomes shorter and then scattering of them increases. The influence of the magnetic field strength on the plasma, created at the rear of a substrate, has been observed. In particular, the floating potential and the charged particle bombardment of the substrate were measured. Permanent magnets at the rear of the substrate, outside of the chamber, could make the configuration of the magnetic field change and control the floating potential from - 3 to - 59 V. At the same time, they influenced the current-voltage characteristics of a probe and made it change following the direction of the field. Ti 0 ₂ is a very important thin film material in optics because the refractive index is high and it can also satisfy the requirements of a hard, dense and chemically stable coating. In our study, the effect of the floating potential, and the resulting ion beam bombardment on the properties of Ti 0 ₂ thin films deposited by reactive planar magnetron sputtering, has been observed. In reactive magnetron sputtering of Ti 0 ₂, as the partial pressure of oxygen is increased, reaction products form on the target (it is poisoned) which lead to an unstable situation with the <b>cathode</b> <b>switching</b> from metal to oxide uncontrollably. More sophisticated control techniques are required in order to get a stoichiometric Ti 0 ₂ film. The oxygen flow was controlled by observation of the light emission of the Ti spectral line. This was measured using a band pass filter and a photomultiplier. It maintained the oxygen flow by regulating a piezovalve. The optical emission controller gave a complete range of Ti to oxygen ratios. As a result, we obtained samples with a high refractive index of 2. 52 at 633 nm and a high deposition rate of 4 Å/s. The properties measured were the refractive index, the surface composition and morphology, and the crystallinity. The relationship between the refractive index and the proportions of 'anatase' and 'rutile' crystal structures of the Ti 0 ₂ films was especially considered and the dependence on the floating potential was assessed. Also, Al₂ 0 ₃, Cuo, ZnO have been sputtered and the effect of pressure instability assessed. Their properties were measured...|$|R
