40|$|When using {{hydraulic}} valves, {{measurement of}} the <b>control</b> <b>spool</b> position is especially critical. Therefore {{in the context of}} this project a new type of sensor for measuring position was developed in cooperation with the partners. The measuring system consists of a row of 32 Hall-effect sensors, in front of which a magnet is moved. Evaluating the field propagation allows the position of the lead magnet can be derived. IMECH GmbH was chiefly responsible for designing the lead magnet and for mechanical integration into a hydraulic valve. A construction was developed and implemented which considered field-theoretical and design aspects while ensuring optimal resolution of the sensor. At at data rate of 4. 3 kHz, a resolution of 2 #mu#m is attainable. Test and measurements have verified the suitability of the sensor for control purposes in hydraulic systems. (orig.)

40|$|A knuckle boom crane is {{characterized}} by being a versatile machine that during operation experiences large load variations caused by the changes in position and payload. Common uses are as a mobile loader crane mounted on trucks and in offshore applications. Since their introduction the use of counterbalance valves (CBV) have been the de facto standard on load-carrying hydraulically actuated applications like the knuckle boom crane. It offers a simple and practical solution {{to one of the}} issues of mobile cranes: Controlling the load safely when lowering. By law (e. g. European Standard) the hydraulic circuit of load-carrying applications is required to contain a load holding protection device. The classical way of actuating such a crane is to use a circuit containing a pressure compensator valve and a directional control valve (DCV) in series with a CBV. This circuit {{is referred to as the}} base circuit. It is well known that this combination of valve components tends to introduce instability in the base circuit. This is mainly a problem when the controlled actuator is subjected to a negative load, because this will require the CBV to throttle the return ﬂow. The instability presents itself as pressure oscillations in the hydraulic circuit which cause the mechanical structure to oscillate. The consequence of the oscillations is a decreased accuracy of the boom motion which create a safety risk, reduces productivity and introduces an undesirable extra fatigue load. The objective of this project was to investigate the oscillations created in the hydraulic circuit of knuckle boom cranes and reduce their severity. The effort has mainly been split in two: First, was looked into existing solutions with the focus on the ones not requiring control systems to function. This was done with reliability and robustness in mind. The investigation identiﬁed the pressure control valve (PCV) as the best commercially available solution. The use of a PCV to control the inlet ﬂow in crane applications was rather uncharted territory. The valve, a DCV with a pressure <b>control</b> <b>spool</b> manufactured by Danfoss, has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally. A linear stability analysis has been performed with the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion. This analysis of the valve used together with a hydraulically actuated experimental setup indicates that the combination is stable in all situations. The use of the pressure <b>control</b> <b>spool</b> in the DCV is a simple and robust solution to the stability problem of the base circuit. Not related to the PCV’s ability to reduce the oscillations the use of it in knuckle boom cranes, however, comes with certain drawbacks. The drawbacks include a load dependent dead band and a load dependent inlet ﬂow. In order to achieve similar behavior as the normal pressure compensated DCV a closed loop control system is required. These issues are addressed in this project, where control schemes are proposed to handle them. In the second part the perspective of the search was broadened to include solutions using control systems. This has lead to the development of a novel, patent pending, concept that signiﬁcantly reduces the oscillations of the base circuit. It introduces a secondary circuit where a low-pass ﬁltered value of the load pressure is generated and fed back to the compensator of the ﬂow supply valve. The work has demonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement of stability obtained for a system with the novel concept implemented both theoretically and experimentally. The stability has been investigated both using a linear and a nonlinear model of a hydraulically actuated experimental setup. The presented novel concept circuit has the same steady state characteristics as the base circuit but without the corresponding oscillatory nature. Because the main spool of the DCV is not used for stabilising the system, the novel concept can be combined with any feedback control strategy. In this project, the novel concept is presented with linear actuators only. However,its use covers circuits with rotational actuators and CBV’s as well. The base circuit is used as a reference for comparison. Therefore, the stability of the base circuit is also investigated with a linear model...|$|E

Most problematic the oscillations are with an accessory scale on the binlift as it does not tolerate oscillations in the position where it takes measurements. These oscillations are caused by load control valves and wrong directional <b>control</b> valve <b>spools</b> make these oscillations worse. To figure out possible solutions for the oscillations the thesis has comprehensive load control valve theory part which summarizes all the traditional and latest inventions related to load control valves.

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{hierarchical}} control design of an electro-hydraulic actuator, {{which is used}} to improve the roll stability of vehicles. The purpose of the control system is to generate a reference torque, which is required by the vehicle dynamic control. The control-oriented model of the actuator is formulated in two subsystems. The high-level hydromotor is described in a linear form, while the low-level spool valve is a polynomial system. These subsystems require different control strategies. At the high level, a linear parameter-varying control is used to guarantee performance specifications. At the low level, a control Lyapunov-function-based algorithm, which creates discrete control input values of the valve, is proposed. The interaction between the two subsystems is guaranteed by the spool displacement, which is control input at the high level and must be tracked at the low-level <b>control.</b> The <b>spool</b> displacement has physical constraints, which must also be incorporated into the control design.

In this paper, a fault-tolerant control strategy for an intelligent independent metering valve that allows continued operation if a sensor fails is described. The twin-spool valve example utilizes position sensors to stabilize the spool positions and eliminate hysteresis, and pressure sensors to provide digital pressure compensation, electronic load sensing, and other features. An independent metering valve has redundancy provided by four sensors working together to control the flow {{into and out of}} a single actuator. Although two sensors are needed to control the flow through a spool, the controller can be reconfigured to ensure the flow is always <b>controlled</b> on the <b>spool</b> with both sensors working. To accomplish this, the concept of cross-port pressure control is introduced that uses the faulty side of the valve to maintain constant pressure on the non-faulty side.

40|$|A {{spool valve}} as a flow {{direction}} control valve has usually been used in a hydraulic system. In recent years, some hydraulic actuator systems need high accuracy <b>control</b> of the <b>spool</b> valve {{in order to control}} the delivery precisely. For the reason, it is very important practically to know dynamic motion of the spool. To analyze the dynamic characteristics of the spool valve, it is necessary to consider the dynamic motion of the spool. Springs, solenoids and working fluid, which is pressurized by the pump in the circuit, support the spool. The motion of the spool is governed complicatedly by pressure force, flow force, electromagnetic force and mechanical spring force acting on itself. As a result, it is difficult to analyze the dynamic motion of the spool, and therefore, any commercial code to calculate the dynamic characteristics of the spool valve dose not exist at present. Final target {{of this study is to}} develop numerical code to predict precisely the dynamic motion of the spool valve.

The main focus {{of this study is}} on revealing the dynamic properties of the priority control system for a developed high-speed on–off digital valve. In this article, a detailed introduction to the high-speed on–off digital valve and its priority control system is performed first, which includes the system function, structural composition, and operation principle. Thereafter, a simulation model of the priority control system is established using the AMESim software and the dynamic characteristics are simulated. Simulation results including the variations in the pulse-width modulation signal, coil current, and the main spool displacement of the directional valve are presented and discussed. They indicate that the opening time of the main spool increases with the duty ratio of the voltage signal. Moreover, the main spool displacement is basically equal in one single pulse-width modulation signal cycle, and thus, it is proportional to the cycle number of the pulse-width modulation signal.

Pilot controlled proportional valve is designed and analyzed to get small pressure change rate after blow-off, {{and to get}} a fast response of the damper, a reverse damping mechanism is adapted. The reverse continuous variable damper is designed as a HS-SH damper which offers good body control with reduced transferred input force from the tire, compared with any other type of suspension system. The damper structure is designed, so that rebound and compression damping forces can be tuned independently, of which the variable valve is placed externally. The rate of pressure change with respect to the flow rate after blow-off becomes smooth when the fixed orifice size increases, which means that the blow-off slope is controllable using the fixed orifice size.

40|$|Swash plate {{pumps are}} widely used to drive {{hydraulic}} systems, especially because they offer high specific power. In order to improve their performance and make them more reliable, {{it is necessary to}} reduce the flow fluctuations, incorporate a control system that is more responsive, and minimize vibration levels. Furthermore, the flow should be controlled according to load requirements and pipe response at the design level. Moreover, {{there is a need to}} monitor the health of the system by analysing its vibration signatures. A novel port plate design is used with a pair of deep silencing grooves on the edges of delivery and suction ports, which reduces the flow fluctuations and improves the pump output. In addition to the load information, the pipe dynamics are also used as a control input. Hence, pipe instabilities with different boundary conditions are studied, where simple, accurate and comprehensive expressions to describe the pipe instabilities are produced, solved, and plotted. In swash plate pumps, the control unit changes the pump output according to the load requirements. The current pump design is equipped with a double negative feedback strategy. The inner loop <b>controls</b> the <b>spool</b> position, and the outer loop controls the swash plate angle. Since this design has a high rise time, it was suggested to equip the pump with a single feedback PD controller. Although this reduced the rise time, it introduced high levels of vibration. The present research proposes a new control strategy with a single feedback PID controller that minimizes vibration levels. Results are obtained experimentally. The control strategy is generalized to control the pump flow according to load requirements and pipe vibration levels. A compensation factor is introduced to moderate the negative impact of the pipe vibrations, and to generate a new set value for the inclination angle. For timely detection of faults, the application of wavelet analysis to detect different defects is examined. Some defects are produced, such as pipe flutter, pump dynamic instability, and voltage unbalance in the driving electric motor. Continuous wavelet and discrete wavelet analyses are used to analyze the vibration signature by using Debauches' mother wavelet. The data is collected experimentally.

The Moon is a unique science platform because it allows access to radio frequencies that do not penetrate the Earth's ionosphere and because its far side is shielded from intense terrestrial emissions. A radio antenna can be realized by using polyimide film as a substrate, with a conducting substance deposited on it. Such an antenna can be rolled into a small volume for transport, then deployed by unrolling, and a robotic rover offers a natural means of unrolling a polyimide film-based antenna. An antenna deployment mechanism was developed that allows a thin film to be deposited onto a ground surface, in a controlled manner, using a minimally actuated rover. The deployment mechanism consists of two rollers, one driven and one passive. The antenna film is wrapped around the driven roller. The passive roller is mounted on linear bearings that allow it to move radially {{with respect to the}} driven roller. Springs preload the passive roller against the driven roller, and prevent the tightly wrapped film from unspooling or "bird's nesting" on the driven spool.
