5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the condition represents a state of heightened sensitivity to antigenic stimuli, with <b>cross-reactivity</b> of the resulting cell-mediated immune response with cells of the epithelium. Some hypothesize that aphthous stomatitis is caused by expression of HLA class II antigens along with the normally found HLA class I antigens in epithelial cells, which results in them being recognized by the immune system as foreign cells rather than self. Various antigenic triggers have been implicated as a trigger, including L forms of streptococci, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus.|$|E
5|$|These {{laboratory}} tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute {{phase of the}} illness {{with the exception of}} serology. Tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies, types IgG and IgM, can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection. Both IgG and IgM are produced after 5–7 days. The highest levels (titres) of IgM are detected following a primary infection, but IgM is also produced in reinfection. IgM becomes undetectable 30–90 days after a primary infection, but earlier following re-infections. IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a primary infection, IgG reaches peak levels in the blood after 14–21 days. In subsequent re-infections, levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting serotype of the virus. In testing for IgG and IgM antibodies there may be <b>cross-reactivity</b> with other flaviviruses which may result in a false positive after recent infections or vaccinations with yellow fever virus or Japanese encephalitis. The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than fourfold increase in levels of specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.|$|E

We found that, for many <b>cross-reactivities,</b> vaccination, when it had been preceded by a prior infection, provided more protection than vaccination alone. However, at some <b>cross-reactivities,</b> the prior infection reduced protection by clearing the vaccine before it had the chance to produce protective memory.

40|$|A {{series of}} human autoantibodies against {{thyroglobulin}} (Tg) which exhibit different specificities for iodothyronines were studied. The {{ability of a}} thyroxine (T 4) -containing peptide (T 4 P) isolated from human thyroglobulin (Tg) to displace [125 I]T 3 from human T 3 -specific autoantisera was 11 - 50 times {{greater than that of}} T 4 alone. These antisera therefore strongly recognize amino acids adjacent to T 4 in the Tg structure. This was confirmed when a Tg preparation (Tg[0. 05]) containing an average of only 0. 05 of a T 4 residue/molecule and much less T 3 had good <b>cross-reactivities</b> with these antisera. <b>Cross-reactivities</b> of other Tg preparations with different T 4 contents increased only slowly with increase of T 4 content up to a mean of 6. 6 residues/molecule and were not proportional to T 3 content. In contrast, <b>cross-reactivities</b> with a human T 4 -specific autoantiserum were strongly dependent on T 4 content. Tg[0. 05] was 500 times less reactive than T 4 P and 615 times less than T 4. <b>Cross-reactivities</b> rose rapidly as the T 4 content of Tg preparations increased from a mean of 0. 05 to approx. 1 - 2 residues/molecule. Thyroxine is therefore a dominant feature of the antigenic site for this antiserum. There was little further increase in <b>cross-reactivities</b> for those Tg preparations containing up to an average of 6. 6 residues T 4 per molecule, confirming previous conclusions that all T 4 -containing sites are not immunologically identical and that autoantibodies exhibit a preference for particular sites on Tg. Similar conclusions were reached for a non-specific iodothyronine-binding antiserum. These results indicate that iodothyronine specificity in human autoantisera is not necessarily determined by the iodothyronine present in the immunogenic area, but by the precise site selected by the immune response. T 4 - or non-specific antibodies have thyroxine as a dominant feature of the antigenic site. T 3 - specific antibodies have the thyroxine residue as a peripheral feature of the binding site, and {{it is not necessary to}} postulate that T 3 was part of the immunogen or is required in the epitope.

25|$|Myasthenia gravis {{is another}} common {{autoimmune}} disease. This disease causes fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue. The disease occurs due to detectable antibodies produced against the human acetylcholine receptor. The receptor contains a seven {{amino acid sequence}} (Trp-Thr-Tyr-Asp-Gly-Thr-Lys) in the α-subunit that demonstrates immunological <b>cross-reactivity</b> with a shared immunodominant domain of gpD of the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Similar to HIV-1, gpD also aids in binding to chemokines on the cell surface of the host to gain entry into the host. <b>Cross-reactivity</b> of the self epitope (α-subunit of the receptor) with antibodies produced against HSV suggests that the virus {{is associated with the}} initiation of myasthenia gravis. Not only does HSV cause immunologic <b>cross-reactivity,</b> but the gpD peptide also competitively inhibits the binding of antibody made against the α-subunit to its corresponding peptide on the α-subunit. Despite this, an autoimmune response still occurs. This further shows an immunologically significant sequence homology to the biologically active site of the human acetylcholine receptor.|$|E

By replacing Gly 76 in distal ubiquitin (Ub) by dehydroalanine we designed the diubiquitin (diUb) activity-based probe UbG 76 Dha-Ub (OTULIN activity-based probe [ABP]) that couples to the catalytic site of OTULIN and thereby captures OTULIN in its active conformation. The OTULIN ABP displays high selectivity for OTULIN and does not label other M 1 -cleaving DUBs, including CYLD. The only detectable <b>cross-reactivities</b> were the labeling of USP 5 (Isopeptidase T) and an ATP-dependent assembly of polyOTULIN ABP chains via Ub-activating E 1 enzymes.

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{studies on the}} human specific B- and T-cell responses against diphtheria toxoid (DT) had shown that the B- and T-cell antigenic determinants were mostly assembled topographic sites with large intra-molecular <b>cross-reactivities.</b> In order to characterize further the B-cell responses against DT, and to investigate these <b>cross-reactivities,</b> we have produced 54 murine monoclonal antibodies (moAbs) against the native DT. Determination of their antigenic specificity showed that 25 moAbs recognized conformational determinants on the native DT, 20 moAbs reacted against the A fragment (DTA) of the toxin, and nine moAbs reacted with at least three distinct highly purified CNBr peptides of the B fragment (DTB); some of them simultaneously recognized two or three purified CNBr peptides of DTB.

25|$|To {{create a}} western blot, gel {{electrophoresis}} {{is used to}} separate native proteins by 3-D structure or denatured proteins by {{the length of the}} polypeptide. Polyacrylamide gel is generally used for the electrophoretic separation of proteins, and SDS is generally used as a buffer (as well as in the gel) in order to give all proteins present a uniform negative charge, since proteins can be positively, negatively, or neutrally charged. This type of electrophoresis is known as SDS-PAGE (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Prior to electrophoresis, protein samples are often boiled to denature the proteins present. This ensures that proteins are separated based on size and prevents proteases (enzymes that break down proteins) from degrading samples. Following electrophoretic separation, the proteins are transferred to a membrane (typically nitrocellulose or PVDF), where they are blocked with milk (or other blocking agents) to prevent non-specific antibody binding, and then stained with antibodies specific to the target protein. Lastly, the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining, which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods. The gel electrophoresis step is included in western blot analysis to resolve the issue of the <b>cross-reactivity</b> of antibodies.|$|E

SELEX, an in vitro selection technology, was used on a single stranded DNA library harboring a 12 randomized nucleotide sequence in order to isolate aptamers showing affinity for LXRα. Enzyme-linked assays and surface plasmon resonance measurements showed that the selected aptamers had strong affinities for LXRa with apparent dissociation constants, K(d) s, in nanomolar range.
