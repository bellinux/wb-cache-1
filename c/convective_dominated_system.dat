40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is {{to prove that the}} mole based {{formulation}} of a pellet model simulating the steam methane reforming reaction is identical to the novel mass based formulation. To prove this, the numerical methods of orthogonal collocation and least squares will be used. These numerical methods will also be examined to ensure that no numerical differences occur because of the numerical method used. The different formulations were proven identical for the Maxwell-Stefan and the dusty gas diffusion models. This was not obtainable for the relatively simpler Wilke and Wilke-Bosanquet models. It was also proven that the numerical methods of orthogonal collocation and least squares yield identical results both for diffusion <b>dominated</b> and <b>convective</b> <b>dominated</b> problems. However, the orthogonal collocation method was superior in the terms of simulation speed for diffusion dominated problems, whereas the least squares method is superior for <b>convective</b> <b>dominated</b> problems. A novel under-relaxation method was also developed during the thesis. By application of this method to the pellet models a reduction in simulation times by approximately 75 % was seen...|$|R

40|$|Measured {{groundwater}} {{temperatures in}} the surficial zone are dependent on the properties of porous media and vertical flow velocity. Sensitivity analyses, collinear diagnostics and an inverse numerical solution to the one-dimensional heat transport equation are used to determine which parameters can be estimated from temperature measurements in the surficial zone. This is done for heat transport in the saturated zone considering a constant vertical flow velocity. The use of temperature profiles, temperature time-series and temperature envelopes are considered. There is an important difference between a conduction and a convection <b>dominated</b> <b>system.</b> Sensitivity analysis shows that temperature measurements are sensitive to effective thermal conductivity and heat capacity and are insensitive to effective porosity and thermal dispersivity. In a conduction <b>dominated</b> <b>system,</b> temperature is also insensitive for vertical velocity. Collinear diagnostics show that in a conduction <b>dominated</b> <b>system,</b> only the combination of heat capacity and effective thermal conductivity, the thermal diffusivity, can be derived.

40|$|This study {{uses the}} GATE (GARP Atlantic Tropical Experiment) upper air {{network in the}} tropics {{combined}} with high resolution SMS- 1 (Synchronous Meteorological Satellite) derived winds at low levels, to identify the time-varying kinematics, and mass flux within the region of an intense cloud cluster on September 5, 1974. Satellite data was stored, displayed, and processed on the _Man-Computer interactive ga ta- Access System (McIDAS). Measurements of cloud area expansion covering 20 h determined the cloud cluster stages. Quantitative measurements of the mass flux and kinematic properties of the cluster are given for the growth, growth-mature, and mature-dissipating stages of the cluster. In the growth phase of the cluster strong convergence exists below 900 mb. Relative winds show that the mass inflow to the cluster comes from the west-southwest below 950 mb within the subcloud layer. During the growth-mature stage deep <b>convective</b> <b>system</b> <b>dominates</b> the cluster. Strong low level convergence decreases as divergence at 250 mb becomes dominant. In the growth stage downward motion exists above 600 mb, which becomes strongly upward as the cluster matures. Maximum vertical motion shifts from 800 to 300 mb in the mature-dissipating stage. A mass budget quantitatively describes the horizontal and vertical mass exchanges {{in and around the}} cluster. In the growth stage subcloud layer air is horizontally transported from distances greater than 300 km from the cluster center, transported upward in the cluster, and exits in the 800 - 600 mb layer. The growth-mature stage, characterized by wide-spread deep convection shows that mass is raised at the 200 - 250 mb layer, where it is transported northward. Most of this mass is supplied by the large scale flow of warm moist air below 950 mb. Relative winds show that deep convection in the cluster is responsible for the upward transport of equatorial air to higher latitudes, supporting the view that cloud clusters {{are an integral part of}} the Hadley circulation cell. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSpurious {{oscillations}} {{occur in}} the numerical results of <b>convective</b> <b>dominated</b> problems with discontinuities when central interpo- lation schemes are used. Upwind interpolation is necessary to overcome these oscillations. In this work, an upwind scheme is proposed to solve the unsteady convection-diffusion equation using Radial Basis Function (RBF) based Local Hermitian Interpo- lation (LHI) with PDE centres. It is a meshless numerical method based on the interpolation of overlapping RBF systems and also satisfy the governing partial differential equations at certain specified locations. Local hermite interpolation gives symmetric non-singular interpolation matrix which can be inverted easily to solve the system of equations. The scheme is implemented to unsteady benchmark problems and validated against the corresponding analytical solutions. Comparisons with the benchmark solutions show that the proposed upwind scheme is stable and produces significantly accurate results especially for convection dominated problems...|$|R

This numerical model presents a system of simple convective equations. A Cell Vertex Finite Volume Method is applied for solving the governing equations on triangular unstructured meshes. Using unstructured meshes provides great flexibility for modeling the flow in arbitrary and complex geometries, such as urban environments. The equation of continuity is simultaneously solved with convective equations in a coupled manner using Artificial Compressibility technique. In order to verify the model, numerical model results are compared with available experimental measurements for pollutant dispersion in an urban street canyon. The efficiency of the developed computer code is demonstrated by its application to simulation pollutant transport in urban environments. Keywords...|$|R
