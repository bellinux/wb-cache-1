All three aftermarket conversions modify the forward portion of the aircraft to provide room for up to ten cargo pallets, while leaving the remaining space to fit around 45 to 58 passenger seats.

The model was {{also known as the}} 747-200 <b>Combi.</b> As on the -100, a stretched upper deck (SUD) modification was later offered. A total of 10 converted 747-200s were operated by KLM.

5|$|Despite the {{successful}} debut, 757 sales remained stagnant {{for most of}} the 1980s, a consequence of declining fuel prices and a shift to smaller aircraft in the post-deregulation U.S. market. Although no direct competitor existed, 150-seat narrow-bodies such as the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 were cheaper to acquire and carried nearly as many passengers as some airlines' 757s. A three-year sales drought abated in November 1983 when Northwest Airlines placed orders for 20 aircraft, which averted a costly production rate decrease. In December 1985, a freighter model, the , was announced following a launch order for 20 aircraft from UPS Airlines, and in February 1986, a freighter-passenger <b>combi</b> model, the , was launched with an order for one aircraft from Royal Nepal Airlines.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} {{research on the}} hazards of cigareDes, {{people are looking for}} a safer alterna 3 ̆eve to smoking. Electronic CigareDes were introduced in the early 2000 ’s to serve this purpose, and they are gaining increasing popularity. Many e-cigareDe companies claim that the use of e-cigareDes is completely harmless because of <b>combus</b> 3 ̆eon of the organic liquids would cause the inhala 3 ̆eon of only water vapor and carbon dioxide along with the flavors and nico 3 ̆ene. Companies also adver 3 ̆ese their products to help smokers quit smoking. Recently, “vaping” has grown increasingly popular especially with minors since several states s 3 ̆ell allow the sale of e-cigareDes to minors. Studies have shown that more teenagers are vaping, and that it may lead to the use of real cigareDes. In more recent news there have been reports of respiratory problems arising from e-cigareDe use, as well as the cigareDes exploding during use causing harm to the user. There are two main concerns that individuals may have concerning e-cigareDes. Most users are concerned about the compounds absorbed by the body, while non users are concerned with the compounds present in the vapors exhaled by users. To address the concerns of e-cigareDe users, the vapors were analyzed using simultaneous thermal analysis infrared spectroscopy (STA-IR) and the results indicate that the vapors released aUer hea 3 ̆eng are not simply carbon dioxide and water, so the liquids do not undergo <b>combus</b> 3 ̆eon and may not be as harmless as claimed by ecigareDe companies.

40|$|Subject of {{this work}} is a dynamic {{simulation}} model for PCCI combustion {{that can be used}} in closed-loop control de-velopment. A detailed multi-zone chemistry model for the high-pressure part of the engine cycle is extended by a mean value model accounting for the gas exchange losses. The resulting model is capable of describing PCCI com-bustion with stationary exactness. It is at the same time very economic with respect to computational costs. The model is further extended by identified system dynamics influencing the stationary inputs. For this, a Wiener model is set up that uses the stationary model as a nonlinear system representation. In this way, a dynamic nonlinear model for the representation of the controlled plant Diesel engine is created.

The salient feature of the proposed mechanism is that char-N is converted competitively to NH ~ as well as to NO at the surface of the particles.

The theoretical predictions of the model are compared with the experimental data for three kinds of chars, of which the parent coals are Taisei (anthracite, China), Taiheiyo (non-caking bituminous, Japan) and an activated sludge (a pseudo low-rank coal from waste-water t eat-ment) : their fuel ratios range from 0. 12 to 4. 16. Quantitative agreement is found between the predictions of the model and the measured values for the transient formation of char-NO and for the overall fractional conversion of char-N into char-NO.

40|$|We used {{chemical}} data (3, 907 lakes) and phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) data (225 lakes) from Swedish lake monitoring {{programs to}} assess the effects of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition on nutrient limitation and phytoplankton biomass in unproductive Swedish lakes. There was a clear north–south gradient of increasing lake concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, which {{was related to the}} pattern of atmospheric N input. On the basis of positive relationships between total phosphorus (P) concentrations and phytoplankton biomass we conclude that lakes in areas of enhanced N deposition are mainly P limited during summer. This relationship was not detected in lakes in pristine areas with low N deposition, which, together with experimental evidence from the literature, suggest possible N limitation. During summer, lakes in high N-deposition areas had clearly higher phytoplankton biomass relative to the total phosphorus concentrations compared to lakes in low N-deposition areas. Thus, in Swedish unproductive lakes, high atmospheric N input is reflected by increased lake concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and, possibly, by a shift from natural N limitation of phytoplankton to P limitation. Our results also reveal that increased N input has caused a eutrophication with higher phytoplankton biomass as the result.

Additionally, functional relationships were developed for data within soil orders to estimate total SOC HTC and N stores in pedons with missing surface organic horizons where only thicknesses were known. These relationships are presented in order to fill-in missing data and to better define the existing data set for future use. Some 1904 missing Db data points and 1612 corrected SOC HTC data points were added to the total of 4240 points in the 609 pedons that constitute the updated dataset.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 This report {{presents}} {{the study of}} wood combustion and combustion systems for a combined cycle wood-fired power plant. The power plant consists of a twin air cycle and a single steam cycle. The fuel for this power plant is wood and wood waste with particle size {{in the range of}} three inch minus and a moisture content of 35 to 60 percent wet basis. The distinguishing features of this power plant are: direct combustion of wood, indirect-fired gas turbine, and combined cycle with a gas turbine cycle and a Rankine steam cycle. The three alternative designs of this power plant were considered. System 2 is designed for dry fuel combustion, with a dryer utilized. System 5 is designed for wet fuel combustion; therefore, the dryer of system 2 is not used. In system 7, which is designed for wet fuel combustion, a trimburner is used to increase the inlet temperature of the gas turbine from 1450 F to 1612 F. The wood fuels have a wide range of particle size and moisture content which affect the combustion of the fuel. In this report the combustion of wood and the effects of variables such as moisture content, particle size, and excess air on combustion of wood have been analyzed, and the results of the analysis are presented. Because of the variety of wood combustion systems available, in this work several combustion systems have been reviewed with the purpose of recommending a <b>combus</b> tion system for the use in this power plant. An evaluation of wood combustion based on the principles of conservation of mass, the first law of thermodynamics, the second law of thermodynamics and a prescribed extent of completion is presented.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} the potential of the EXODUS evacuation model in building environments. The latest PC/workstation version of EXODUS is described and is also applied to a large hypothetical supermarket/restaurant complex measuring 50 m x 40 m. A range of scenarios is presented where population characteristics (such as size, individual travel speeds, and individual response times), and enclosure configuration characteristics (such as number of exits, size of exits, and opening times of exits) are varied. The results demonstrate a wide range of occupant behavior including overtaking, queuing, redirection, and conflict avoidance. Evacuation performance is measured by a number of model predicted parameters including individual exit flow rates, overall evacuation flow rates, total evacuation time, average evacuation time per occupant, average travel distance, and average wait time. The simulations highlight the profound impact that variations in individual travel speeds and occupant response times have in determining the overall evacuation performance. 1.
