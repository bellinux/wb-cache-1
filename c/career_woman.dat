Suspicious that Mike is spending the night with Edie, Susan enters Edie's home uninvited with the pretense of borrowing sugar. While inside, she accidentally knocks over a candle, which sets fire to the entire house. Susan flees the scene, leaving behind her glass measuring cup. Though wracked with guilt, Susan is relieved to learn that Mike was not the man with whom Edie was fornicating.

40|$|This {{study used}} a {{questionnaire}} designed to identify personal characteristics that successful <b>career</b> <b>women</b> {{have in common}} across career fields. Information was elicited on self-esteem, achievement motivation, self-descriptive words, ethnicity, age, income level and occupational field, among other things. Subjects were women publicly recognized as successful by their peers. Twenty three of the sample (n = 249) were randomly selected for interviews. The questionnaire responses were analyzed to identify differences in self-esteem and achievement motivation between occupational fields, age, income levels, ordinal positions and other independent variables. Collectively, the results identified {{a high degree of}} self-esteem as the strongest characteristic shared by these successful <b>career</b> <b>women.</b> Additionally, self-esteem was affected by ordinal position of the subjects and related {{to the level of the}} women's perceived success and emotional compensation satisfaction. The <b>career</b> <b>women</b> defined the major components of success as: (1) achieving one's personal goals, (2) receiving recognition from others, (3) enjoying one's work, and (4) contributing to the community, to others, etc. The <b>career</b> <b>women</b> generally described themselves as responsible, competent, and hardworking. Non-traditional <b>career</b> <b>women</b> described themselves somewhat differently, as responsible, enthusiastic and confident. There was no statistical support for a relationship to achievement motivation. This finding, combined with the career women's definition of success, shows that items used in the questionnaire did not measure achievement motivation for this group. Several conclusions were drawn from the data analysis: (1) <b>career</b> <b>women</b> who have been publicly recognized by their peers have a high level of self-esteem; (2) women have a unique pattern of <b>career</b> development; (3) <b>women</b> focused more on "contributing to society/to others" than on "earning a high salary," and (4) women defined themselves as "hardworking" rather than "achievement oriented. " Hypotheses made on the basis of previous research on <b>career</b> <b>women</b> and on Individual Psychology theory were generally supported.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate if retirement expectations and subjective wellbeing of Australian baby boom <b>career</b> <b>women</b> differ for age, marital status and employment status. This paper reports some major findings from a national survey comprised of 1052 baby boom women. Sixty-three percent of baby boom <b>career</b> <b>women</b> who responded to the open-ended question, "Do you have retirement plans?" stated expectations that their post-career years would consist of paid and/or volunteer work. Thirty-two percent of women respondents planned extensive travel or had educational aspirations in their post-career years. These results suggest that baby boom <b>career</b> <b>women</b> reject the traditional concept of 'retirement'. Results from two MANOVAs were statistically significant. First, early baby boomers (EBBs), women born from 1946 to 1954, were significantly more satisfied with life overall and had higher achievement expectations than late baby boomers (LBBs), women born from 1955 to 1964. Second, married baby boom <b>career</b> <b>women</b> were significantly more salisfied with life overall than single baby boom <b>career</b> <b>women.</b> There was no significant difference for employment status...|$|R

5|$|Desperate Housewives {{focuses on}} the lives of several {{residents}} on the suburban neighborhood of Wisteria Lane. In recent episodes, Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher) has encouraged a stripper Robin Gallagher (Julie Benz) to quit her job and turn her life around. Robin briefly lived with Susan, but moved out after Susan became jealous of Robin living in the same house as her husband, Mike Delfino (James Denton). Robin moved in with Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) and revealed she was a lesbian, prompting the heterosexual Katherine to start developing romantic feelings for Robin. Lynette (Felicity Huffman) is pregnant, despite being a middle-aged <b>career</b> <b>woman</b> and already having four children. This has caused strain for Lynette and her husband, Tom Scavo (Doug Savant). Bree (Marcia Cross) is the ambitious owner of a catering company, and her son Andrew (Shawn Pyfrom) works as her personal assistant.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{looked at}} the discursive {{construction}} of <b>career</b> <b>women</b> in Malaysia edition of Cleo,, a women's magazine which is also published in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Singapore. This study used the framework of Fairclough (1995, 2001), widely known as the three-dimensional framework, that analyses a text {{as well as the}} context ‘engaged’ in a dialectical relation (Fairclough, 2009). 12 articles from Cleo about <b>career</b> <b>women,</b> published between August 2007 and August 2008, were analysed. The articles titled ‘Career Coach’ addressed divergent issues on <b>career</b> <b>women</b> (e. g., workplace problems, personality problems, and acquisition of workplace skills and ethics). The analysis shows how the identities of <b>career</b> <b>women</b> in Malaysia are constructed according to the modern and globalised system of management discourses, by means of ‘empowering’ them in terms of job skills, knowledge, actions and personalities. The analysis further shows that popular media is consistently trying to shape the preferred identity(s) for women, in this case through the means of a female magazine...|$|R

25|$|Over the years, Erica {{developed}} into different character archetypes. Soap operas once featured only one-dimensional characters who were either good or bad. By the 1970s, characters were written with more depth, fitting into archetypes {{consisting of the}} young-and-vulnerable romantic heroine, the old-fashioned villain, the rival, the suffering antagonist, Mr. Right, the former playboy, the meddlesome and villainous mother/grandmother, the benevolent mother/grandmother, and the <b>career</b> <b>woman.</b> Erica was established as the rival to Tara Martin's young-and-vulnerable romantic heroine. As the rival, Erica was written as money and status-conscious as well as sexually aggressive. Erica was generally positioned as the antagonist keeping true love pairings, such as Tara and Phillip Brent, apart.|$|E
40|$|Disagreement {{is one of}} {{language}} functions that considered an act, which by its nature threatens someone?s positive face. Since disagreement is one of face threatening acts, {{it is also the}} source of many miscommunications in daily social interactions. Many linguists believe that certain social factors, such as status, effects the way people express language functions. Therefore, the writer was interested in analyzing how <b>career</b> <b>women</b> and housewives express their disagreement. The writer wants to see the differences and the similarities of strategies they used in expressing disagreement. In conducting this research, the writer used descriptive approach in order to gain a more holistic picture of the way <b>career</b> <b>women</b> and housewives express disagreement to their husband. Using a discourse completion test, which consisted of five situations, collected the data. The writer asks ten respondents (five <b>career</b> <b>women</b> and five housewives) to respond to the situations and record their answers. The data then were analyzed by classifying the respondents into the eight disagreement strategies proposed by Garcia. The findings of the study show that <b>career</b> <b>women</b> mostly used confrontational strategies and housewives mostly used non-confrontational. <b>Career</b> <b>women</b> and housewives are different in using disagreement strategies like challenge, refusing to cooperate, order, strong denial, giving reasons and expression of willingness to cooperate. They also have the similarity in using disagreement strategies like criticism of a third party and down toned suggestion...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study is to target <b>career</b> <b>women</b> with {{metabolic}} syndrome (Mets) risk factors and investigate the effectiveness of using a health management platform (HMP) to improve health behavior and reduce Mets risk factors. Methods: This study adopted the structure of a randomized control trial, and targeted full-time <b>career</b> <b>women</b> aged ≥  20 years, who possessed Mets risk factors. Intervention was performed via an Internet-based HMP, and changes in health behavior 1. 5 months and 3 months after intervention and Mets risk factors 3 months after intervention were analyzed. Results: A total of 66 <b>career</b> <b>women</b> participated in this study. At 3 months, the HMP group displayed better results than the control group in terms of waist circumference, fasting glucose, and the mean number of Mets components. In terms of the group and time interaction analysis on health behavior, the HMP group only displayed significantly better results in exercise scores than the control group at 1. 5 months.

25|$|Despite some {{legislation}} passed in 1985 to ensure equality, both the Equal Opportunity Law, which prohibits discrimination, and the Child-Care Leave Law, which gives parents unpaid leave {{to tend to}} children, then return to their old position or a similar one, lacked any real power to drive change. No penalties were issued for companies who ignored this, meaning, only women who take on the same burden as male employees, of working full-time, with no breaks for pregnancy or child rearing, are able to have any hope of advancement. Boards of directors, public servants, and judiciary branches of work are typically closed to any <b>career</b> <b>woman</b> not willing to work full-time and overtime regularly. The largest part {{of the labor force}} are not the full-time career women, but housewives who work part-time, supplementing the household budget. In fact, the government discourages housewives from making too much money, because if housewives make a certain amount, they lose their husband's dependent allowance. This limits the jobs women can do while married. In many instances of the Japanese work force, women who wish to receive equal pay and chances at promotion are expected to act like their salaryman counterparts. This is indicative of one of the problems women face when seeking employment in Japan. While equal in part, they still face discrimination. Many businesses lack the flexibility to offer work which fits the irregular schedules of housewives. There have been some strides forward however. The equal employment legislation of the 1980s did prohibit discrimination in the training, benefits, retirement, and dismissal, however, not in recruitment, hiring, or promotion.|$|E

40|$|Worldwide {{attention}} is focused on the massive baby boom cohort as they move into their retirement years. The purpose of the focus group stage of this research project was to use the voices of Australian baby boom <b>career</b> <b>women</b> (women born from 1946 to 1964) to inform the development of a conceptual measure and model of psychosocial wellbeing for this cohort. This project addresses Australia's National Research Priority: Ageing well, ageing productively, by meeting the urgent need to assess the perceptions of baby boom women prior to retirement transitions. This paper reports on the findings from six focus groups: three conducted in Far North Queensland (n = 16) and three conducted in Melbourne (n = 14). The results of thematic content analysis confirmed five major themes: generativity; continuity of self-accomplishment; spirituality; autonomy and unknown caregiver roles. Results of content analysis of the Melbourne group added a sixth emerging dimension; concerns for personal safety. Additionally, differences between baby boom <b>career</b> <b>women</b> to previous cohorts emerged, which may originate in shifting identities and changing gender roles. Furthermore, dissimilarities appeared between early baby boomers (women born from 1946 to 1955) compared with late baby boomers (women born from 1956 to 1964), suggesting that baby boomers comprise more than one cohort. Significant findings presented in this paper are that late baby boom <b>career</b> <b>women</b> were significantly more satisfied in their career/vocation than were early baby boom <b>career</b> <b>women.</b> These areas provide fertile ground for development of better social strategies to improve the capacities, productivity, independence and sense of purpose in life of baby boom <b>career</b> <b>women</b> in retirement, if indeed they do retire...|$|R

Since The Cosby Shows inception, Cosby had always intended for Clair {{to reflect the}} ways in which women's roles have evolved in both the home and workplace. Clair is depicted as a hardworking <b>career</b> <b>woman</b> with strong feminist principles, most evident in the character's early confrontations with chauvinistic son-in-law Elvin.

[...] Networks {{were not interested in}} developing the series, so Cosby opted for a somewhat more autobiographical approach instead. Cosby eventually based The Cosby Show on his stand-up comedy film [...] (1983), which heavily features jokes about his relationship with his wife and their interactions with their children. Clair is based on Cosby's real-life wife Camille. Although the role of the parents in the show evolved dramatically from The Cosby Shows initial inception to final production, the one idea that was retained from Cosby's detective series was the concept of a strong <b>career</b> <b>woman.</b>|$|E

500|$|Author Garry Wills {{believed}} that Davis was generally underrated {{as an actress}} because her constrained part in Hellcats was her most widely seen performance.

[...] Ronald Reagan biographer Lou Cannon nevertheless characterized her as a [...] "reliable" [...] and [...] "solid" [...] performer who held her own in performances with better-known actors. After her final film, Crash Landing (1958), Davis appeared for a brief time as a guest star in television dramas, such as the Zane Grey Theatre episode [...] "The Long Shadow" [...] (1961), where she played opposite Ronald Reagan, as well as Wagon Train and The Tall Man, until she retired as an actress in 1962.|$|E
500|$|Despite many {{explicit}} {{allusions to}} several world religions, Ingrid Reichel {{states that the}} novel is a book for “readers with humor, for reasoners (…), for darwinists, on no account for creationists, {{to a lesser extent}} for people of faith, but rather for atheists, … and fundamentalists drop out entirely”. Another aspect is identified by Karin Gayer when pinpointing the parallel evolution of the patriarchal hierarchy in the narrated society and the alluded social matriarchy, the first resembling chimpanzee communities and the second representing those of bonobos. In addition, she points out the strength of the women characters. She declares {{that at the time of}} the Australopithecus, neither chimpanzees nor bonobos existed, but [...] "the author is not interested in paleoanthropologic precisenesses—he is interested in mirroring our society, in exposing human behavior". She compares Costello with the alpha of a community of chimpanzees and a classical manager, and Akshaya with bonobo females and a modern-day <b>career</b> <b>woman.</b> With regard to these underlying comparisons, Gayer says, [...] "On another level we are struck by the permanent notional commingling of the simian and the human, a composition which leaves us pensive and asks the legitimate question where we, who consider ourselves sapiens in a double sense, should finally classify man." ...|$|E

[...] She was given a regular backup slot in Detective Comics starting with issue #384 (February 1969), alternating issues with Robin until issue #404, after which she had the backup slot to herself. Frank Robbins wrote nearly all of these backups, which were penciled first by Gil Kane and later by Don Heck. Barbara Gordon’s Batgirl exceeded the earlier Bat-Girl and Batwoman characters in popularity, and readers requested for her to appear in other titles. Although some readers requested that Batwoman also continue to appear in publication, DC responded to the fan-based acclaim and criticism of the new character in an open letter in Detective Comics #417 (1971), stating: [...] "I'd like {{to say a few words}} about the reaction some readers have to Batgirl. These are readers who remember Batwoman and the other Bat-girls from years back... They were there because romance seemed to be needed in Batman's life.
