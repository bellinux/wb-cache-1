5|$|Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben (1551–1637) was Countess of Mansfeld and the {{daughter}} of Johann (Hans) Georg I, of Mansfeld Eisleben. She converted Gebhard, Seneschal of Waldburg, the Prince-Elector of Electorate of <b>Cologne</b> and archbishop of the Diocese of <b>Cologne</b> to the Protestant faith, leading to the <b>Cologne</b> War (1583–1588).|$|E

5|$|The <b>Cologne</b> War, 1583–1589, was {{triggered}} by the 1582 conversion of the Archbishop-Prince Elector of <b>Cologne,</b> Gebhard, Truchsess of Waldburg, to Calvinism, and his subsequent marriage to Agnes of Mansfeld-Eisleben in 1583. When he refused to relinquish the Electorate, a faction of clerics in the <b>Cologne</b> Cathedral chapter elected another archbishop, Ernst of Bavaria, of the House of Wittelsbach.|$|E

5|$|After Gebhard's expulsion, Ernst assumed full {{charge of}} the Electorate of <b>Cologne.</b> In his later years, a nuncio at <b>Cologne</b> took {{responsibilities}} for the financial administration of the archdiocese, and Ernst's nephew, Ferdinand of Bavaria, {{was elected to the}} Cathedral Chapter, the Wittelsbach heir-apparent. When Ernst died in 1612, the Cathedral Chapter duly elected his nephew to the position and Wittelsbachs held the Electorate until 1761. Ernst's victory, both in winning the election in 1583, and in convincing the assembly of other electors to accept him in 1585, confirmed him as the new archbishop of <b>Cologne</b> and gave the Wittelsbach family a foothold on the northern Rhine.|$|E

5|$|But, after {{assessing}} {{the situation in}} Alsace, Julian evidently decided that his force was insufficient to prevail over the Alamanni alone.

Julian then concluded a peace treaty with the Franks. This had the important result of removing half the opposition from the equation and allowing Julian to focus his resources on dealing with the Alamanni.|$|E
5|$|By 1588, Gebhard's {{joint pain}} (Gelenkenschmerz) {{prevented}} him from riding a horse; the climate of <b>Cologne,</b> damp and cold, made his condition worse, so he relinquished his claim on the Electorate {{to the protection of}} Adolf von Neuenahr and Martin Schenck, which they pursued until their deaths later that year.
