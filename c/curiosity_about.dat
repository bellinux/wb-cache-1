5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Martha Dickinson Bianchi and Millicent Todd Bingham kept the {{achievement}} of Emily Dickinson alive. Bianchi promoted Dickinson's poetic achievement. Bianchi inherited The Evergreens {{as well as the}} copyright for her aunt's poetry from her parents, publishing works such as Emily Dickinson Face to Face and Letters of Emily Dickinson, which stoked public <b>curiosity</b> <b>about</b> her aunt. Bianchi's books perpetrated legends about her aunt in the context of family tradition, personal recollection and correspondence. In contrast, Millicent Todd Bingham's took a more objective and realistic approach to the poet.|$|E
5|$|In this 2001 series, Lex Luthor {{is sent to}} Smallville, by {{his father}} Lionel Luthor, to run the local LuthorCorp {{fertilizer}} plant. After driving his car off a bridge, he is saved by Clark Kent and quickly develops a new friendship with the farm boy. As the series unfolds, Lex's <b>curiosity</b> <b>about</b> Clark and all things connected to Clark ultimately destroys their friendship. Lex's relationship with his father is tension-filled {{from the start of}} the show, and eventually comes to an end when Lex murders his father in an effort to discover Clark's secret.|$|E
5|$|When the British {{governor}} of Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, discovered some pygmy {{inhabitants of the}} Congo being abducted by a showman for exhibition, he rescued them and promised to return them to their homes. The grateful pygmies fed Johnston's <b>curiosity</b> <b>about</b> the animal mentioned in Stanley's book. Johnston was puzzled by the okapi tracks the natives showed him; while he had expected {{to be on the}} trail of some sort of forest-dwelling horse, the tracks were of a cloven-hoofed beast.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Athens, of the 6th century BC, was {{the busy}} trade centre at the {{confluence}} of Egyptian, Mesopotamian and Minoan cultures {{at the height of}} Greek colonisation of the Mediterranean. The philosophical thought of this period ranged freely through many subjects. Empedocles (490430 BC) foreshadowed Darwinian evolutionary theory in a crude formulation of the mutability of species and natural selection. The physician Hippocrates (460370 BC) avoided the prevailing superstition of his day and approached healing by close observation and the test of experience. At this time a genuine non-anthropocentric <b>curiosity</b> <b>about</b> plants emerged. The major works written about plants extended beyond the description of their medicinal uses to the topics of plant geography, morphology, physiology, nutrition, growth and reproduction.|$|E
5|$|From about 1040, Shen's {{family moved}} around Sichuan {{province}} {{and finally to}} the international seaport at Xiamen, where Shen's father accepted minor provincial posts in each new location. Shen Zhou also served several years in the prestigious capital judiciary, {{the equivalent of a}} federal supreme court. Shen Kuo took notice of the various towns and rural features of China as his family traveled, while he became interested during his youth in the diverse topography of the land. He also observed the intriguing aspects of his father's engagement in administrative governance and the managerial problems involved; these experiences had a deep impact on him as he later became a government official. Since he often became ill as a child, Shen Kuo also developed a natural <b>curiosity</b> <b>about</b> medicine and pharmaceutics.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Usher {{began dating}} TLC member Chilli Thomas, and their {{relationship}} lasted for two years. In 2003, Usher started working on the album which would become Confessions, which contained songs inspired by the personal lives of Usher and his collaborators. The songs about infidelity and pregnant mistresses were inspired not by Usher's private life, but by Jermaine Dupri's own personal challenges at the time. Dupri deliberately intended to create an air of mystery about Usher, and arouse fans' <b>curiosity</b> <b>about</b> {{how much of the}} infidelity story was Usher's own confession. The unintended result of this was to arouse Thomas's suspicions about Usher. They broke up in December 2003.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th century, {{botanical gardens}} began their {{contribution}} to a deeper scientific <b>curiosity</b> <b>about</b> plants. If a botanical garden is defined by its scientific or academic connection, then the first true botanical gardens were established with the revival of learning {{that occurred in the}} European Renaissance. These were secular gardens attached to universities and medical schools, used as resources for teaching and research. The superintendents of these gardens were often professors of botany with international reputations, a factor that probably contributed to the creation of botany as an independent discipline rather than a descriptive adjunct to medicine.|$|E
5|$|When Richard {{was five}} years old, his mother {{gave birth to a}} younger brother, Henry Philips, who died at four weeks of age on February 25, 1924. Four years later, Richard's sister Joan was born, and the family moved to Far Rockaway, Queens. Though {{separated}} by nine years, Joan and Richard were close, as they both shared a natural <b>curiosity</b> <b>about</b> the world. Their mother thought that women did not have the cranial capacity to comprehend such things. Despite their mother's disapproval of Joan's desire to study astronomy, Richard encouraged his sister to explore the universe. Joan eventually became an astrophysicist specializing in interactions between the Earth and the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|No formal {{educational}} {{method was}} applied to the production, and no attempt was made to follow the official UK National Curriculum for primary school history. The show's creators were acutely aware of educational possibilities, but—in line with Deary's overall mandate for the franchise—saw their basic role as popularising history, inspiring further <b>curiosity</b> <b>about</b> the academic subject rather than attempting to teach it seriously. The show's effectiveness in this respect was endorsed by historical scholars, including presenter Dan Snow. Writing in The Independent, Gerard Gilbert notes that Horrible Histories is part of an extensive British black-comedy tradition not only in adult but also in children's programming. In later series, as usable material from the books began to run out, there was a progression towards more sophisticated, adult sketches in terms of both creativity and educational content, as the show began relying on material that their younger viewers would be less familiar with.|$|E
50|$|La Monnoye {{began his}} studies in Jesuit schools, and {{attracted}} attention for his epigrams in Latin and essays in French. By his father's wish, {{he went to}} study law at Orléans. There, during the harsh study of jurisprudence, he gave way to his literary tastes by gathering <b>curiosities</b> <b>about</b> the authors and books that he read. He began legal practice at the Parlement de Dijon in 1662; but had little inclination for that profession, and, using his health as an excuse, left the bar and devoted himself entirely to the literary arts.|$|R

5|$|Rudimentary botanical science {{began with}} empirically-based plant lore passed from {{generation}} to generation in the oral traditions of paleolithic hunter-gatherers. The first written records of plants were made in the Neolithic Revolution about 10,000 years ago as writing was developed in the settled agricultural communities where plants and animals were first domesticated. The first writings that show human <b>curiosity</b> <b>about</b> plants themselves, rather than the uses that could be made of them, appears in the teachings of Aristotle's student Theophrastus at the Lyceum in ancient Athens in about 350 BC; this is considered the starting point for modern botany. In Europe, this early botanical science was soon overshadowed by a medieval preoccupation with the medicinal properties of plants that lasted more than 1000 years. During this time, the medicinal works of classical antiquity were reproduced in manuscripts and books called herbals. In China and the Arab world, the Greco-Roman work on medicinal plants was preserved and extended.|$|E

25|$|The {{interest}} in genealogical DNA tests {{has been linked}} to both an increase in <b>curiosity</b> <b>about</b> traditional genealogy and to more general personal origins.

40|$|Cinder Cone is {{the most}} recent cinder cone {{eruption}} in the continental United States at ~ 350 years old. This study examines the physical characteristics of the explosive deposit of the volcano in order to infer eruption timing, style, and mechanisms. Building on previous work and using spatial extent, field relationships, and grain size, componentry, and textural data of ten samples from one column, this study demonstrates that Cinder Cone erupted {{in at least two}} distinct phases with at least two distinct eruption styles. This speaks to the changing magma supply and transport processes occurring beneath the volcano. <b>Curiosities</b> <b>about</b> the eruption include the extensive degree of contamination that contributed abundant quartz xenocrysts to all the deposits. Future work includes determining the extent and mechanism/s of contamination and tephra component creation. These data are important for informing hazard assessments of areas with abundant cinder cone volcanoes...|$|R

25|$|Goddard {{was born}} in Worcester, Massachusetts, to Nahum Danford Goddard (1859–1928), a farmer, and Fannie Louise Hoyt (1864–1920).

25|$|The narrator's {{standards}} for {{what constitutes a}} cliffhanger seem broader than in modern literature.

25|$|On {{the facts}} of the case, the Court stated that {{although}} it had only found nine statements made by Shadrake to be contemptuous, these statements constituted serious acts of scandalizing contempt. Furthermore, the extent and mode of publication and distribution aggravated the harm. The Court noted the admission by Shadrake's counsel that nearly 6,000 copies had been sold in Singapore and abroad due to heightened <b>curiosity</b> <b>about</b> the book during the trial. The medium of publication – a book – was also more permanent, compared to past cases which had involved articles in journals or magazines. This increased the risk of damage to public confidence in the administration of justice.|$|E
