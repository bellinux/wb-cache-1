5|$|Holloway was {{scheduled}} to fly home from Aruba on May 30, 2005, but she failed to appear for her flight. She was last seen by her classmates outside of Carlos'n Charlie's, a restaurant and nightclub in Oranjestad. She {{was in a car}} with local residents Joran van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers, Deepak and Satish. When the three men were questioned, they said that they dropped off Holloway at her hotel and denied knowing what had become of her. Upon further investigation by authorities, Van der Sloot was arrested twice on suspicion of involvement in her disappearance and the Kalpoes were each arrested three times. Due to lack of evidence, the three suspects were released each time without being <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b> Holloway's parents have criticized Aruban police for the lack of progress in the investigation and interrogation of the three men who were last seen with their daughter. The family also called for a boycott of Aruba, which gained Alabama Governor Bob Riley's support but failed to gain widespread backing.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Jackson {{was accused}} {{of child sexual abuse}} by Evan Chandler, on behalf of his then-13-year-old child, Jordan Chandler. To the father's disapproval and concern, his son had become friends with the {{musician}} in May 1992. Allegedly under the influence of a controversial sedative administered by Evan Chandler, a dentist, his son said that Jackson had touched his penis. Evan Chandler was tape-recorded threatening to damage the singer's music career, and engaged Jackson in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial settlement. Jordan Chandler then told a psychiatrist and later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex. Jackson settled a civil suit out of court with the Chandler family and their legal team for $22,000,000 in January 1994. After Jordan Chandler refused to testify in the criminal proceedings, the state closed its criminal investigation citing lack of evidence, and Jackson was not <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b> Jordan Chandler later admitted to lying. After Jackson's death, Evan Chandler committed suicide.|$|E

25|$|From the 1950s {{through the}} 1970s, the IRS began using {{technology}} such as microfilm {{to keep and}} organize records. Access to this information proved controversial, when President Richard Nixon's tax returns were leaked to the public. His tax advisor, Edward L. Morgan, became the fourth law-enforcement official to be <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> during Watergate.|$|E
25|$|This {{accomplishment}} led to {{a federal}} investigation and caused some to think Jackson was wrongly targeted because of his efforts. Indeed, some of his supporters deride the scrutiny of his casual friendships as a racist effort to undermine a prominent black official and several respected black businessmen, noting {{that no one has}} been <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E

25|$|There is an exception. If {{the victim}} is less than 18 and the partner is a parent, guardian, sibling or any other person closer than a fourth cousin or has any type of {{authority}} over the victim (for example, a teacher) then the assailant may be <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b> For instance, it's criminal for a manager of any age {{to have sex with}} a 17-year-old subordinate, even if the sex is consensual.|$|E
25|$|Resorts may ban persons {{convicted of}} sex, drug, or violent crimes. Policies vary, but might include doing a {{criminal}} record check or checking a sex offender registry.

An example would be someone who thought they were in a secluded area while nude bathing with no lewd intent, but were <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> anyhow.|$|E
25|$|Scaife gained notoriety for evading weak {{campaign}} finance laws to donate US$990,000 to the 1972 re-election campaign of U.S. President Richard M. Nixon. Scaife was not <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime,</b> but about $45,000 went to a fund linked to the Watergate scandal. Scaife later said he was repulsed by the scandal and refused to speak with Nixon after 1973. Following Duggan's suicide and then Watergate, he shifted his political giving from politicians' campaigns to anti-communist research groups, legal defense funds, and publications.|$|E

25|$|The {{power of}} the state to detain persons prior to trial was {{extended}} by the Sixteenth Amendment, in 1996. In 1965, the Supreme Court ruled in the O'Callaghan case that the constitution required that an individual <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> could be refused bail only if she was likely to flee or to interfere with witnesses or evidence. Since the Sixteenth Amendment, it has been possible for a court to take into account whether a person has committed serious crimes while on bail in the past.|$|E
25|$|The Fourth Amendment (1791) protects {{people against}} {{unreasonable}} searches and seizures of either self or property by government officials. A search can mean {{everything from a}} frisking by a police officer or to a demand for a blood test to a search of an individual's home or car. A seizure occurs when the government takes control of an individual or something {{in his or her}} possession. Items that are seized often are used as evidence when the individual is <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>crime.</b> It also imposes certain limitations on police investigating a crime and prevents the use of illegally obtained evidence at trial.|$|E
