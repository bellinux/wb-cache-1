5|$|On February 27, 1853, the twice-widower Crittenden {{married his}} third wife, Elizabeth Moss. Moss was twice-widowed, most {{recently}} to General William Henry Ashley. Moss was Crittenden's wife until his death. Crittenden served {{as attorney general}} until the expiration of Fillmore's term in 1853. Following his service as attorney general, he returned to private life. He made {{a substantial amount of}} money establishing mining claims for his <b>clients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> former Mexican territory.|$|E
5|$|In 1806 Jennings {{headed west}} to Jeffersonville in the Indiana Territory, but stayed only briefly. He moved to Vincennes, {{the capital of}} the Indiana Territory, in early 1807 to open his own law {{practice}} and was admitted to the bar in April. Jennings had difficulty earning an income as a lawyer, finding there were too few <b>clients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> territory to keep him busy. In July 1807 Nathaniel Ewing, the federal land receiver at Vincennes and a friend from Pennsylvania, invited Jennings to take a job as assistant to John Badollet, the registrar at the federal land office in Vincennes. Along with Badollet, Jennings engaged in land speculation. He obtained significant land holdings and made substantial profits. In 1807 Jennings became an assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature and continued to speculate on the sale of public lands.|$|E

25|$|Sexual {{harassment}} {{is a criminal}} offense, punishable by {{up to two years}} in jail. The law encompasses sexual advances in the workplace or in educational institutions and between service providers or <b>clients.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> workplace it applies only in hierarchical situations, where the harasser is of higher rank or position than the victim. Although the legislation exists and was enforced, accusations remained rare, and the extent of the problem was not documented.|$|E
25|$|Irish {{independence}} in 1921 was marked more by continuity with the British legal system than with change. The legal profession remained divided between barristers (or abhcóidí in Irish) and solicitors (or aturnaetha in Irish). There was some blurring {{of the distinction}} between their roles over the years. Notably, under Section 17 of the Courts Act 1971, solicitors were granted a right of audience in all courts, although in practice relatively few solicitors act as advocates for their <b>clients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Superior Courts.|$|E

25|$|One {{interesting}} but short-lived {{operation was}} {{the development of}} the Swallow Doretti sports car.

Although it was a superior product to its competition, T.I. felt it might be politic not to aggravate some of the larger clients of its steel and aluminium business. Despite recognising the Doretti's qualities, Stedeford showed his legendary toughness and shut the operation down, transferring the employees {{to other parts of the}} T.I. group.|$|E

25|$|The {{descendants}} of Amangkurat III, who {{were allowed to}} return from Ceylon, and the royal brothers, especially Pangeran Ngabehi Loring Pasar and the banished Pangeran Arya Mangkunegara, tried to gain {{the support of the}} Dutch by spreading gossips of rebellion against the king and the patih (vizier), Danureja. At the same time, the patih tried to strengthen his position by installing his relatives and <b>clients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regencies, sometimes without king’s consent, {{at the expense of other}} nobles’ interests, including the powerful queens dowager, Ratu Amangkurat (Amangkurat IV’s wife) and Ratu Pakubuwana (Pakubuwana I’s wife), much to the confusion of the Dutch.|$|E

After the war, Husband headed the engineering consultancy, successfully expanding their business, with <b>clients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immediate post-war years including the British Iron and Steel Research Association, National Coal Board and the Production Engineering Research Association.|$|E
25|$|Many male prostitutes offer {{services}} at hotel rooms booked {{for the purpose}} instead of the client's residence. This is because while accompanying a client to his residence prostitutes become vulnerable to assault or robbery. Some prostitutes have sex with <b>clients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{back seat of the}} client's car. There are many part-time prostitutes who are students, salespersons, workers in hotels and garages. They become involved in the profession to earn extra money, and often to get a job in the film industry. Some involved in prostitution often manage to save enough money to go abroad in search of a job. Many boys are frequently used by the police without getting paid. Plainclothes police officers are often involved in the extortion and blackmail of male prostitutes.|$|E
25|$|Saskatchewan medical {{health system}} has faced {{criticism}} {{due to a}} lack of accessibility to the midwifery program. According to Leanne Smith, the director for maternal services in the Saskatoon Health Region declared half of the women who apply for the midwifery program are turned away. Ministry of Health data shows midwives saw 1,233 <b>clients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2012-13 fiscal year (which runs April to March). But in that fourth quarter, 359 women were still on waiting lists for immediate or future care. The provincial Health Ministry received 47 letters about midwifery services in 2012, most of which asked for more midwives. As a continuing problem in the Saskatchewan health care system, more pressure has been placed to recruit more midwives for the province.|$|E
