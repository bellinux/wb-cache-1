25|$|Simple lenses {{are subject}} to the optical aberrations {{discussed}} above. In many cases these aberrations can be compensated for to a great extent by using a combination of simple lenses with complementary aberrations. A <b>compound</b> <b>lens</b> is a collection of simple lenses of different shapes and made of materials of different refractive indices, arranged one after the other with a common axis.|$|E
25|$|For a thin lens, the {{distances}} S1 and S2 are measured from {{the object and}} image {{to the position of}} the lens, as described above. When the thickness of the lens is not much smaller than S1 and S2 or there are multiple lens elements (a <b>compound</b> <b>lens),</b> one must instead measure from the object and image to the principal planes of the lens. If distances S1 or S2 pass through a medium other than air or vacuum a more complicated analysis is required.|$|E
25|$|A lens is a {{transmissive}} {{optical device}} that focuses or disperses a light beam {{by means of}} refraction. A simple lens consists of {{a single piece of}} transparent material, while a <b>compound</b> <b>lens</b> consists of several simple lenses (elements), usually arranged along a common axis. Lenses are made from materials such as glass or plastic, and are ground and polished or moulded to a desired shape. A lens can focus light to form an image, unlike a prism, which refracts light without focusing. Devices that similarly focus or disperse waves and radiation other than visible light are also called lenses, such as microwave lenses, electron lenses, acoustic lenses, or explosive lenses.|$|E

Diffraction limit comes from single slit theory based on absorption aperture of the <b>compound</b> refractive <b>lenses.</b> X-rays passing through lenses form Airy pattern.

2500|$|These {{fixtures}} {{feature a}} <b>compound</b> <b>lens</b> {{which allows the}} designer to place obstructions within the image path which are then projected. These obstructions could be [...] "gobos" [...] or shutters. A profile is a spot light, but allows for precise focusing.

2500|$|There {{exists a}} point called {{the circle of}} least confusion, where {{chromatic}} aberration can be minimized. It can be further minimized by using an achromatic lens or achromat, in which materials with differing dispersion are assembled {{together to form a}} <b>compound</b> <b>lens.</b> The most common type is an achromatic doublet, with elements made of crown and flint glass. This reduces the amount of chromatic aberration over a certain range of wavelengths, though it does not produce perfect correction. By combining more than two lenses of different composition, the degree of correction can be further increased, as seen in an apochromatic lens or apochromat. Note that [...] "achromat" [...] and [...] "apochromat" [...] refer to the type of correction (2 or 3 wavelengths correctly focused), not the degree (how defocused the other wavelengths are), and an achromat made with sufficiently low dispersion glass can yield significantly better correction than an achromat made with more conventional glass. Similarly, the benefit of apochromats is not simply that they focus 3 wavelengths sharply, but that their error on other wavelength is also quite small.|$|E

40|$|Large {{temporal}} front {{distortion of}} femtosecond pulses occurs in lenses having chromatic aberration. The effect {{is due to}} the difference between the phase and group velocities. Equations describing the pulse-front delay in singlet <b>lenses,</b> achromats, and <b>compound</b> <b>lenses</b> are presented. The pulse-front delay is several orders of magnitude larger than the broadening caused by group-velocity dispersion in the lens material.

40|$|Owing to the {{difference}} between the phase and group velocity, the pulse front may be delayed with respect to the phase front by several picoseconds when traversing a lens or a lens system. The delay is a parabolic function of the input radius. The delay is calculated for singlet <b>lenses,</b> achromats, <b>compound</b> <b>lenses,</b> telescopes.

5000|$|Because focus {{depends on}} the {{distance}} between lens and the sensor or film plane, focus in the space {{in front of the}} camera is not on a point but rather on a plane parallel to the film plane. Spherical construction of lenses, rather than the ideal parabolic construction which is rarely and expensively achieved, means that this plane is slightly concave—more so in simple single element lenses and increasingly so with lenses of lower quality construction and materials. <b>Compound</b> <b>lenses</b> are built to correct this [...] "spherical aberration" [...] or [...] "curvature of field".|$|R

40|$|Thermal neutron beams are an {{indispensable}} tool in physics research. The spatial and the temporal resolution attainable in experiments {{are dependent on}} the flux and collimation of the neutron beam which remain relatively poor, even for modern neutron sources. These difficulties may be mitigated {{by the use of}} optics for focusing and imaging. Refractive and diffractive optical elements, e. g. <b>compound</b> refractive <b>lenses</b> and Fresnel zone plates, are attractive due to their low cost, and simple alignment. These optical elements, however, suffer from chromatic aberration, which limit their effectiveness to highly monochromatic beams. This paper presents two novel concepts for focusing and imaging non-monochromatic thermal neutron beams with well-known optical elements: (1) a fast mechanical transfocator based on a <b>compound</b> refractive <b>lens,</b> which actively varies the number of individual lenses in the beam path to focus and image a time-of-flight beam, and (2) a passive optical element consisting of a <b>compound</b> refractive <b>lens,</b> and a Fresnel zone plate, which may focus and image both continuous and pulsed neutron beams.

50|$|While in {{principle}} a simple convex lens will suffice, in practice a <b>compound</b> <b>lens</b> {{made up of}} a number of optical lens elements is required to correct (as much as possible) the many optical aberrations that arise.

50|$|A {{telecentric}} lens is a <b>compound</b> <b>lens</b> {{that has}} its entrance or exit pupil at infinity; in the prior case, this produces an orthographic view of the subject.

The simplest way to make a lens telecentric is to put the aperture stop at one of the lens's focal points.|$|E
