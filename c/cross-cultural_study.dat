40|$|From a methodological {{perspective}} <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>studies</b> {{in psychology}} differ in three dimensions. First, <b>cross-cultural</b> psychological <b>studies</b> can be exploratory or test specific hypotheses. Second, some <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>studies</b> compare countries or ethnic groups while other <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>studies</b> relate specific {{characteristics of a}} country or ethnicity (e. g., socialization patterns or religiosity) to psychological variables. Third, studies can compare either constructs (e. g., do Chinese and Kenyans mean the same when they say {{that a person is}} intelligent?) or score levels (e. g., are Americans more extravert than Italians?). A classification of <b>cross-cultural</b> psychological <b>studies,</b> based on the three dimensions, is presented and examples are given. ...|$|R

2500|$|EMU {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} colleges to require <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>study</b> of all undergraduates, with a university-sponsored program beginning in the 1970s. EMU recommends that its undergraduate students earn 15 semester hours of credit by living, studying and serving in cross-cultural settings. Nine cross-cultural credits are the minimum number required for graduation; these can be earned through in-class study and a summer stint of three to six weeks in a cross-cultural setting. Most undergraduates embark on semester-long, faculty-led, cross-cultural experiences, usually involving home stays in non-U.S. settings, such as Israel, Guatemala, South Africa, India, Spain and Morocco. But some students opt to satisfy the cross-cultural requirement by studying and interning in Washington D.C., while living in EMU-owned housing supervised by faculty members. Others choose individualized alternatives, such as a summer of studying business with an international manufacturer or 11 months of service with the SALT program of Mennonite Central Committee.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cross-cultural</b> <b>studies,</b> {{sometimes}} called holocultural studies or comparative studies, is a specialization in anthropology and sister sciences (sociology, psychology, economics, political science) that uses field data from many societies {{to examine the}} scope of human behavior and test hypotheses about human behavior and culture. <b>Cross-cultural</b> <b>studies</b> is the third form of cross-cultural comparisons. The first is comparison of case studies, the second is controlled comparison among variants of a common derivation, {{and the third is}} comparison within a sample of cases. Unlike comparative studies, which examines similar characteristics of a few societies, <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>studies</b> uses a sufficiently large sample so that statistical analysis can be made to show relationships or lack of relationships between the traits in question. These studies are surveys of ethnographic data.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Health status measures, used {{to measure}} the {{subjective}} functioning and well-being of respondents, are increasingly being used in trials of treatments that are undertaken in a variety of countries. To assess comparability of results gained from such <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>studies,</b> it is important for researchers to know the comparability of instruments across cultures. One measure widely used in <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>studies</b> is the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ- 39). We evaluated response rate, data quality, score reliability, and scaling assumptions of the instrument in the United States, Canada, Spain, Italy, and Japan. METHODS: Our data were gained from the Global Parkinson's Disease Survey, a cross-national survey, in which the PDQ- 39 was interviewer administered to respondents. RESULTS: Our data suggest that the PDQ- 39 is, for the most part, a valid and reliable measure that can be appropriately and meaningfully used in <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>studies.</b> However, one of the dimensions of the measure, Social Support, may not be sufficiently reliable {{to be used as a}} primary endpoint in trials. CONCLUSION: The PDQ- 39 seems to be sufficiently robust to be used in trials and surveys in <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>studies...</b>|$|R
