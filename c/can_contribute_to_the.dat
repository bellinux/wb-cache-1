5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{standardized}} diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships <b>can</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.|$|E

25|$|Longitudinal {{studies have}} {{suggested}} adverse working conditions <b>can</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of psychological distress. Psychological distress refers to negative affect, without the individuals necessarily meeting criteria for a psychiatric disorder. Psychological distress is often expressed in affective (depressive), psychophysical or psychosomatic (e.g., headaches, stomach aches, etc.), and anxiety symptoms. The relation of adverse working conditions to psychological distress is thus an important avenue of research. Job satisfaction is also related to negative health outcomes.|$|E

25|$|The {{coagulation}} system {{overlaps with}} the immune system. Some {{products of the}} coagulation system <b>can</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> non-specific defenses by their ability to increase vascular permeability and act as chemotactic agents for phagocytic cells. In addition, some of {{the products of the}} coagulation system are directly antimicrobial. For example, beta-lysine, a protein produced by platelets during coagulation, can cause lysis of many Gram-positive bacteria by acting as a cationic detergent. Many acute-phase proteins of inflammation are involved in the coagulation system.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of positive learning {{accounts for the}} fact that over time, the existence of specific performance measures <b>can</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> improved performance of individuals, leading to a general decrease in the variability of results and thus less effective performance measures. For example, in baseball, the diminished variability in batting averages in the past century is attributed to the improvement of players over time, but it has had the effect of devaluing batting averages as an effective performance measure in the industry.|$|E
