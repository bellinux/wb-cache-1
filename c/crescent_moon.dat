The obverse of these coins have a human figure flanked by lamps and the reverse has the Nandi (bull) symbol, the legend Setu in Tamil with a <b>crescent</b> <b>moon</b> above.|$|E
50|$|Although planets {{appear to}} be {{suspended}} in space, the characters are sitting upon and hanging from <b>crescent</b> <b>moons,</b> and the front cover moon {{and one of the}} planets on the back are made of a substance that is dripping, suggesting there is gravity present in a downward direction. The <b>crescent</b> <b>moons</b> are physically <b>crescent,</b> rather than in shadow, making the whole cover look like a stage prop background. The monkey on the back holds a miniature planet Earth between its feet. A rainbow hangs impossibly in space, despite the supposed lack of atmosphere. (Rainbows appear on all Clearlight covers, with the exception of Delired Cameleon Family.) A bubble also floats in space, similar to those seen on Forever Blowing Bubbles.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, moon idols are a cult item of Early European Religions, {{resembling}} {{a pair of}} horns or <b>crescent</b> <b>moons</b> on a pedestal, and were variously interpreted as testifying to Bull worship, Moon worship, or as a holder for wooden logs {{to be used in}} a fire altar.|$|R

Masks exist for both full and <b>crescent</b> <b>moons.</b> To do this, masks are sometimes completely round, round with painted crescent, or simply a mask with a moon figurehead crest.|$|R
5|$|A fierce sky {{caught in}} the {{dichotomy}} between the setting sun and the <b>crescent</b> <b>moon</b> dominates {{more than a third}} of the painting. The rain-heavy clouds swirling ominously around each celestial entity are separated by a gulf of calmness, intensifying the contrast and infusing the heavens with an unearthly glow. Light from the sky spills onto the landscape: while the western continent and the Nile are bathed in the sun's light, the east and the Tower of Babel are cloaked in shadow.|$|E
5|$|According to the Shyamaladandakam, Matangi plays a ruby-studded veena {{and speaks}} sweetly. The Dhyana Mantra {{describes}} {{her to be}} four-armed, with a dark emerald complexion, full breasts anointed with red kumkum powder, and a <b>crescent</b> <b>moon</b> on her forehead.

5|$|The {{design of}} the flag was {{completed}} in two months by a committee headed by Toh. He initially wanted the flag's entire background to be red, but the Cabinet decided against this, as red {{was regarded as a}} rallying point for communism. According to an account given by Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese population wanted five stars, which were modeled off the flag of the People's Republic of China and the Muslim population wanted a <b>crescent</b> <b>moon.</b> Both of these symbols were combined to create the national flag of Singapore.|$|E

5|$|The Dhyana Mantra of Raja-matangi {{from the}} Purashcharyarnava {{describes}} Matangi as green in colour with the <b>crescent</b> <b>moon</b> upon her forehead. She has long hair, a smiling expression and intoxicated eyes, and wears a garland of kadamba flowers and various ornaments. She perspires a little around the face, which renders {{her even more}} beautiful. Below her navel are three horizontal folds of skin and a thin vertical line of fine hair. Seated on an altar and flanked by two parrots, she represents the 64 arts. The Saradatilaka, adds to this description that Raja-Matangi plays the veena, wears conch-shell earrings and flower garlands, and has flower paintings adorning her forehead.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{altitude}} of the Moon {{in the sky}} varies with the lunar phase and the season of the year. The full moon is highest during winter. The 18.61-year nodes cycle also has an influence: when the ascending node of the lunar orbit is in the vernal equinox, the lunar declination can {{go as far as}} 28° each month. This means the Moon can go overhead at latitudes up to 28° from the equator, instead of only 18°. The orientation of the Moon's crescent also depends on the latitude of the observation site: close to the equator, an observer can see a smile-shaped <b>crescent</b> <b>moon.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The team mascot is a bear like {{creature}} called [...] "Burea". When pronounced {{sound like}} blair or blayer. It probably {{comes from a}} combination of Brave and Warriors; Bra-ior.

50|$|After their {{enormous}} {{success with}} silicated soap, the company faced a new threat from 1884. This was William Hesketh Lever's Sunlight soap. The new Sunlight was a technical and commercial novelty.Gossage's {{response was to}} produce their own similar soap, also wrapped, branded and advertised. This was 'Magical', whose logo included a wizard, and mystical symbols, such as <b>crescent</b> <b>moons.</b> This was successful, but other competitors also entered the market, such as Crosfields of Warrington and Hazelhursts of Runcorn.|$|R
5|$|The {{national}} flag of Singapore was adopted in 1959, the year Singapore became self-governing within the British Empire. It was reconfirmed as the {{national flag}} when the republic gained independence on 9 August 1965. Prior to its independence, {{it was the only}} state flag in Malaysia not to have a 1:2 ratio. The design is a horizontal bicolour of red above white, overlaid in the canton (upper-left quadrant) by a white <b>crescent</b> <b>moon</b> facing a pentagon of five small white five-pointed stars. The elements of the flag denote a young nation on the ascendant, universal brotherhood and equality, and national ideals.|$|E
5|$|Bhikshatana is {{depicted}} with jatabhadra (dishevelled matted locks) or with jatamandala (matted hair {{arranged in a}} circle).

The cupolas are crowned with orthodox crosses, which tower above small <b>crescent</b> <b>moons</b> in memory of old religious wars.|$|R
5|$|Matsya Purana tells a {{different}} story of Chamunda's origins. She with other matrikas was created by Shiva to help him kill the demon Andhakasura, who has an ability - like Raktabija - to generate from his dripping blood. Chamunda with the other matrikas drinks {{the blood of the}} demon ultimately helping Shiva kill him. Ratnakara, in his text Haravijaya, also describes this feat of Chamunda, but solely credits Chamunda, not the other matrikas of sipping the blood of Andhaka. Having drunk the blood, Chamunda's complexion changed to blood-red. The text further says that Chamunda does a dance of destruction, playing a musical instrument whose shaft is Mount Meru, the spring is the cosmic snake Shesha and gourd is the <b>crescent</b> <b>moon.</b> She plays the instrument during the deluge that drowns the world.|$|E
5|$|The male half wears a jata-mukuta (a headdress formed of piled, matted hair) on his head, {{adorned with}} a <b>crescent</b> <b>moon.</b> Sometimes the jata-mukuta is adorned with serpents and the river goddess Ganga flowing through the hair. The right ear wears a nakra-kundala, sarpa-kundala ("serpent-earring") or {{ordinary}} kundala ("earring"). Sometimes, the male eye is depicted smaller than the female one and a half-moustache is also seen. A half third eye (trinetra) is prescribed on the male side of the forehead in the canons; a full eye may also be depicted in middle of forehead separated by both the sides or a half eye may be shown above or below Parvati's round dot. A common elliptical halo (prabhamandala/prabhavali) may be depicted behind the head; sometimes {{the shape of the}} halo may differ on either side.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{the lion}} and sun symbol in a flag is first attested in a {{miniature}} painting illustrating a copy of Shahnameh Shams al-Din Kashani, an epic on Mongol conquest, dated 1423. The painting depicts several (Mongul?) horsemen approaching the walled city of Nishapur. One of the horsemen carries a banner that bears a lion passant with a rising sun on its back. The pole is tipped with a <b>crescent</b> <b>moon.</b> By {{the time of the}} Safavids (1501–1722), and the subsequent unification of Iran as a single state, the lion and sun had become a familiar sign, appearing on copper coins, on banners, and on works of art. The Lion and Sun motif was also used on banners of the Mughals of India, notably those of Shah Jahan.|$|E
5000|$|Another B.C. strip, {{which ran}} November 10, 2003, showed an {{outhouse}} {{with a traditional}} crescent, which a character entered with a vertical graphic [...] "SLAM", only to ask, [...] "Is it just me, or does it stink in here?" [...] Critics including the Council on American-Islamic Relations claimed {{that the combination of}} the vertical bar and the [...] "SLAM", as well as the <b>crescent</b> <b>moons</b> both in the sky and on the outhouse, made the strip a slur on Islam. Hart denied that it was anything but an outhouse joke.|$|R
25|$|The most {{remarkable}} feature is their decorative motifs roughly divided in six groups which complement each other: social simbols, religious simbols, images of posthumous kolo, figural images, clear ornaments, and unclassified motifs (mostly simbolic, geometrical, or damaged). Many of them remain enigmatic to this day; spirals, arcades, rosettes, vine leaves and grapes, lilium, stars (often six-pointed) and <b>crescent</b> <b>Moons</b> {{are among the}} images that appear. Figural images include processions of deer, horse, dancing the kolo, hunting, chivalric tournaments, and, most famously, {{the image of the}} man with his right hand raised, perhaps in a gesture of fealty.|$|R
