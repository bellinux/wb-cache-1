After a few national and European attempts, a worldwide standardization of product data has been developed.

40|$|The {{process of}} casting {{design in the}} {{automotive}} industry has been significantly refined over the years through the capabilities of advanced computer aided design and engineering tools. One of the significant benefits of these computer aided capabilities is the direct access to <b>CAD</b> <b>geometry</b> <b>data,</b> from which finite element models can be quickly developed. Complex structures can be meshed and analyzed over {{a relatively short period}} of time. The application of advanced finite element analyses such as structural modification and optimization are often used to reduce component complexity, weight and subsequently cost. Because the level of model complexity can be high, the opportunity for error can also be high. For this reason, some form of model verification is needed before design decisions made in the FEA environment can implemented in production with high confidence. Dynamic correlation, comparison of mode shapes and natural frequencies, is a robust tool for evaluating the accuracy of a finite element model.

40|$|A novel {{integral}} {{approach was}} applied for the nuclear design analyses performed for the European DEMO Conceptual Study including, for the first time, the automatic generation of analysis models for Monte Carlo calculations from available <b>CAD</b> <b>geometry</b> <b>data</b> by the new McCad conversion tool. Starting from neutronics pre-analyses to define the radial reactor build, a generic neutronics CAD model of the DEMO reactor was constructed serving as basis for the generation of DEMO reactor models employing the HCLL (Helium Cooled Lithium Lead) andHCPB(Helium Cooled Pebble Bed) blankets for the tritium breeding and the power production. The HCLL and HCPB DEMO reactor models were converted to the MCNP geometry representation by the newly developed McCad software tool. The nuclear analyses performed {{on the basis of}} MCNP Monte Carlo calculations using the converted models showed that both DEMO reactor variants could satisfy the requirements for a sufficient shielding and tritium breeding performance. As a major outcome of thiswork it is concluded that the newly established integral approach for neutronics analyses, including the automatic generation of analysis geometry models by McCad, is mature for applications to reactor design analyses and studies.

Our approach makes use of Non-Uniform Rational B-splines to represent model geometry and compatible B-splines to approximate the surface current, and adopts the isogeometric concept in which the basis for analysis is taken directly from <b>CAD</b> (<b>geometry)</b> <b>data.</b> The approach allows for high-order approximations and crucially provides a direct link with CAD data structures that allows for efficient design workflows.

Updating is generally used to guarantee accurate correspondence with reality. This paper focused on the application of dynamic correlation technique and modal updating on truck chassis. The dynamic characteristic of truck chassis such as the natural frequency and mode shape were determined using finite element method. Experimental measurement by modal testing is carried out to determine the accuracy of finite element analysis.

An LCPS (LASERCAV Programming System) enables the computer-aided transformation of <b>CAD</b> <b>geometry</b> <b>data</b> of the component to be translated directly into ready-to-operate CNC programmes. Automatic compliance with the programmed depth of removal is ensured by a depth sensor and control system. The complete system in the past used only the high-precision laser oxide chip caving technique as a stock removal process, whose low removal rate leads to comparatively long machining times. This variant of the process is meant for finish machining. Meanwhile, {{in addition to this}} the laser fusion caving technique based on process investigations carried out at the ILT has reached a state which enables systematic representation and conversion of the measures necessary to optimise the application technique.

40|$|Objective: In some {{surgical}} specialties (eg, orthopedics), robots {{are already}} {{used in the}} operating room for bony milling work. Otological surgery and otoneurosurgery may also greatly benefit from the enhanced precision of robotics. Study Design: Experimental study on robotic milling of oak wood and human temporal bone specimen. Methods: A standard industrial robot with a six-degrees-of-freedom serial kinematics was used, with force feedback to proportionally control the robot speed. Different milling modes and characteristic path parameters were evaluated to generate milling paths based on computeraided design (<b>CAD)</b> <b>geometry</b> <b>data</b> of a cochlear implant and an implantable hearing system. Results: The best-suited strategy proved to be the spiral horizontal milling mode with the burr held perpendicular to the temporal bone surface. To reduce groove height, the distance between paths should equal half the radius of the cutting burr head. Because of the vibration of the robot’s own motors, a high oscillation of the SD of forces was encountered. This oscillation dropped drastically to nearly 0 Newton (N) when the burr head made contact with the dura mater, because of its damping characteristics. The cutting burr could be kept in contact with the dura mater for an extended period without damaging it, because of the burr’s blunt head form. The robot moved the burr smoothly according to the encountered resistances. Conclusion: The study reports the first development of a functional robotic milling procedure for otoneurosurgery with force-based speed control.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Three-dimensional {{geological}} modelling is a {{very important}} and hard work in the numerical simulation of engineering geology and geotechnical engineering. However, the 3 D modelling capability of preprocessing of existing numerical simulation software is far less than professional CAD / CAM modelling software. Therefore, in order to enhance the 3 D modelling efficiency of numerical simulation, data conversion between the CAD / CAM modelling software and numerical simulation software is often in great need. For some historical reasons, the data between CAD / CAM modelling software and numerical simulation software is not so compatible, and there are still some unsolved problems in the process of data transformation, such as incomplete information definitions, lost of topology relations after conversion and failed to identify attribute information, etc. To improve this situation, data conversion interfaces between several commonly used CAD / CAM modelling software and numerical simulation software have been studied in detail, then the shortcomings of existing common data transfer structures are discussed, and then {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} commonly used data standards are compared. Based on the STEP standards, a preliminary data conversion method applicable to the engineering geology has been suggested. It is primary method that can implement data conversion between CAD / CAM software and numerical simulation software by programming.

40|$|Mesh {{generation}} {{has long been}} recognized as a bottleneck in the CFD process. While much research on automating the volume mesh generation process have been relatively successful,these methods rely on appropriate initial surface triangulation to work properly. Surface discretization {{has been one of}} the least automated steps in computational simulation due to its dependence on implicitly defined CAD surfaces and curves. Differences in CAD peometry engines manifest themselves in discrepancies in their interpretation of the same entities. This lack of "good" geometry causes significant problems for mesh generators, requiring users to "repair" the <b>CAD</b> <b>geometry</b> before mesh generation. The problem is exacerbated when <b>CAD</b> <b>geometry</b> is translated to other forms (e. g., IGES) which do not include important topological and construction information in addition to entity geometry. One technique to avoid these problems is to access the <b>CAD</b> <b>geometry</b> directly from the mesh generating software, rather than through files. By accessing the geometry model (not a discretized version) in its native environment, t h s a proach avoids translation to a format which can deplete the model of topological information.
