5|$|Behind the scenes, HIAG {{cultivated}} {{close relationships}} with the ruling <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> (CDU) and the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), garnering attention by inflating its membership numbers and influence. In meetings with politicians in the early 1950s, HIAG claimed to represent 2 million potential voters, a vast exaggeration as only 250,000 Waffen-SS veterans were living in West Germany at that time.|$|E
5|$|The {{announcement}} to {{sell the}} building sparked a fierce public debate. The Green Party, {{at the time in}} a coalition with the SPD, strongly disagreed with the plan. The <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> party held a meeting in October 2006. The director of the Bonn Women's Museum, Marianne Pitzen, accused the initiators of the plan of selling off public property and underestimating the value of cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|Since 1949, {{the party}} {{system has been}} {{dominated}} by the <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> and the Social Democratic Party of Germany. So far every chancellor {{has been a member of}} one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party (in parliament from 1949 to 2013) and the Alliance '90/The Greens (in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles. In the German federal election, 2017, Alternative for Germany gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Walther Gottlieb Louis Leisler Kiep (5 January 1926 – 9 May 2016) was a German {{politician}} of the <b>Christian</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> (CDU). He was {{a member}} of the Bundestag between 1965 and 1976 and again from 1980 to 1982. After switching to state-level politics, he served as minister of economy (1976–77) and minister of finance (1976–80) in Lower Saxony under Ernst Albrecht. In 1982, Kiep was the leading candidate for the CDU in two successive state elections in Hamburg, losing both to incumbent Klaus von Dohnányi. From 1971 until 1992, he was treasurer of his party at the federal level. In this position, Kiep installed a system of unreported income accounts, leading to the CDU donations scandal in 1999.|$|E

This worked, because it fitted Kohl's character and was authentic.|$|E
