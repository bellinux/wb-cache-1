We studied the critical {{height of a}} liquid being drained from tank, that is, the liquid height {{at the moment when}} the air-core vortex reaches to the <b>drain</b> <b>port.</b> We firstly performed some experiments for determining the critical height, and then based upon the information obtained from the experiments; a simple analytical expression was derived to predict the critical height. The experimental results show that the vortex suppressor, which is suggested in the present paper, could effectively reduce the strength of vortex and consequently reduce the critical height. The results also show that the new analytical expression can predict the critical height with less than 20 % error when vortex suppressor is used. To the best of our knowledge, draining from tanks with bell-mouth <b>drain</b> <b>ports</b> has not been paid attention to by other authors...|$|R

Under these optimum operating conditions, the effect of Cellruptor pre-treatment on batch reactors of various substrates and semi-continuous digester of biosludge were investigated at mesophil biosludge, dewatered sludge, digested sludge, fibre sludge, hay, maize silage, minced meat, orange peel, seaweed and yeast.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 5 years single surgeon’s clinically study in a teaching hospital conducted between July 2007 to June 2012. Age group considered was from 11 years to 70 years. Data was obtained from a pre designed profroma from the hospital records and analyzed by chi s quare and percentages. RESULTS: Indication for thyroid surgery was more in females. More cases were between 21 0 30 years. Out of 87 cases in 68 <b>cases</b> <b>drain</b> was not placed and in 19 <b>cases</b> <b>drain</b> was placed.

40|$|The invention, {{a static}} phase {{separator}} (SPS), uses airflow and capillary wetting characteristics to passively separate a two-phase (liquid and air) flow. The device accommodates highly variable liquid wetting characteristics. The resultant design {{allows for a}} range of wetting properties from about 0 to over 90 advancing contact angle, with frequent complete separation of liquid from gas observed when using appropriately scaled test conditions. Additionally, the design accommodates a range of air-to-liquid flow-rate ratios from only liquid flow to over 200 : 1 air-to-liquid flow rate. The SPS uses a helix input section with an ice-cream-cone-shaped constant area cross section (see figure). The wedge portion of the cross section is on {{the outer edge of the}} helix, and collects the liquid via centripetal acceleration. The helix then passes into an increasing cross-sectional area vane region. The liquid in the helix wedge is directed into the top of capillary wedges in the liquid containment section. The transition from diffuser to containment section includes a 90 change in capillary pumping direction, while maintaining inertial direction. This serves to impinge the liquid into the two off-center symmetrical vanes by the airflow. Rather than the airflow serving to shear liquid away from the capillary vanes, the design allows for further penetration of the liquid into the vanes by the air shear. This is also assisted by locating the air exit ports downstream of the liquid <b>drain</b> <b>port.</b> Additionally, any droplets not contained in the capillary vanes are re-entrained downstream by a third opposing capillary vane, which directs liquid back toward the liquid <b>drain</b> <b>port.</b> Finally, the dual air exit ports serve to slow the airflow down, and to reduce the likelihood of shear. The ports are stove-piped into the cavity to form an unfriendly capillary surface for a wetting fluid to carryover. The liquid <b>drain</b> <b>port</b> is located at the start of the containment region, allowing for draining the bulk fluid in a continuous circuit. The functional operation of the SPS involves introducing liquid flow (from a human body, a syringe, or other source) to the two-phase inlet while an air fan pulls on the air exit lines. The fan is operated until the liquid is fully introduced. The system is drained by negative pressure on the liquid drain lines when the SPS containment system is full...|$|R

50|$|A {{gear motor}} (external gear) {{consists}} of two gears, the driven gear (attached to the output shaft {{by way of a}} key, etc.) and the idler gear. High pressure oil is ported into one side of the gears, where it flows around the periphery of the gears, between the gear tips and the wall housings in which it resides, to the outlet port. The gears then mesh, not allowing the oil from the outlet side to flow back to the inlet side. For lubrication, the gear motor uses a small amount of oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated <b>drain</b> <b>port</b> on the motor housing. An especially positive attribute of the gear motor is that catastrophic breakdown is less common than in most other types of hydraulic motors. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the motor gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|R
