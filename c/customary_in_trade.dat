40|$|The static {{aspects of}} a {{substitution}} of polyvinyl chloride by high-density polyethylene in wraparound pipes have been analyzed. For this purpose RJB-LOC profiles, <b>customary</b> <b>in</b> <b>trade,</b> were compared with profiles made of high-density polyethylene. Results of static calculations reveal that PE-HD {{can be used for}} the reconstruction of underground buried drain pipes. In the case of new installations the use of PE-HD is limited by soil properties. The substitution of PVC by PE-HD is connected with essential raises of material costsSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 93 B 1282 / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekDEGerman...|$|E
40|$|For the {{dismantling}} of austenitic components of nuclear facilities fastening techniques, usable remote controlled under water, are investigated. The components are only one-sided accessable. The fastening techniques are based on Drawn Arc Stud Welding, Mechanical Drilling followed by mechanical clamping of the fastening elements and thermal drilling with Contact Arc Metal Cutting (CAMC) followed by mechanical clamping of the fastening elements. In thermal drilling process with CAMC hollow electrodes of different materials with internal water scavenging are investigated with regard to wear behaviour and removal rate. The graphite type EG 88 shows the longest electrode life, tested in plates of thickness from 20 mm up to 65 mm and using dielectric fluid both drinking water and deionized water. 14 holes were drilled in a plate of a thickness of 30 mm (adequate to 420 mm) without electrode-changing, in this time the wear on the length 16, 9 mm. Minor tapered holes and rough interior surfaces of the pearcing holes are the results. Fastening elements plug and blind rivet, which are <b>customary</b> <b>in</b> <b>trade,</b> have been investigated. The latter guarantees the necessary mould clamp. The selected blind rivet is usable for plate-thicknesses from 6 mm up to 42 mm. In tensile test the rivet pin breaks from 78 kN upwards. The rivet case is formed in minor tapered holes {{in the same way}} as in rough interior surfaces of holes. Drill bur does not influence the results. The developed combined one-way fastening elements and repeatedly applicable fastening elements are able to pierce (CAMC), to interlock and also to fix and to transport the segments of the components without changing end effector of the manipulator. Such a general ideal process is demonstrated in 1 : 1 experiment. The developed fastening technologies are usable at least up to a water depth of 20 m.

40|$|It is <b>customary</b> <b>in</b> the {{empirical}} <b>trade</b> literature to analyze specialization patterns of countries using Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) measures. This paper explores the informational {{content of the}} most commonly used RCA index: the Balassa (1965) Index of RCA. After describing the properties of the Balassa Index, we propose a research strategy based on descriptive statistics, kernel density estimation, concentration and Markov stationarity methods in order to analyze the dynamics of overall specialization. How to predict international trade flows {{is one of the main}} issues in economic theory. Although the emergence of the new <b>trade</b> theory <b>in</b> the 1980 s attributed comparative advantage and economies of scale equal importance as explana-tions of why countries trade, as far as trade flows prediction between similar and different (in demand, factor endowments or technology) countries is con-cerned, comparative advantage is still the main theoretical explanation (Davies, 1997). Under free trade, countries will specialize according to and be net exporters of goods in which they have a comparative advantage. Theoretically, taking account of both static demand and supply effects, the following proposition is clear and sufficiently general (Deardorff, 1980) : to identify in which good or industry a country has a comparative advantage one needs only to observe the sign of the difference between autarkic and free trade relative; if the sign is positive the country has a comparative advantage in the production and export of that particular good; if the sign is negative the country has a comparative ∗To whom correspondence should be addressed...|$|R
