40|$|Diffusion bonding of {{structural}} ceramics to superalloys has been investigated. Emphasis {{was placed on}} methods resulting in joints durable at elevated temperatures (500 - 700 ºC) between these two classes of high - temperature materials. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) was used to enhance void elimination at relatively low diffusion bonding temperatures. This results in lower residual stresses, thinner reaction layers and a retained microstructure in the superalloy. The investigation centred on ceramic materials based on silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4). This is the main structural ceramic intended for use in components facing very high temperatures and/or aggressive environment at {{a certain level of}} thermomechanical stress. These ceramics were densified by HIP, with or without a few percent of yttria (Y 2 O 3) as a sintering additive. A silicon nitride composition developed for the turbine wheel in a vehicular gas turbine was the main ceramic, HIPed with 2. 5 wt% Y 2 O 3 to give a material with good mechanical properties up to about 1400 ºC. The increased oxidation resistance of silicon oxynitride (Si 2 N 2 O), as well as the formation of a layer consisting mainly of silicon oxynitride on the surface of silicon nitride components during glass-encapsulated HIP, made it valuable to compare the joining behaviour of these two materials to superalloys. Reaction sinterings of Si 2 N 2 O without sintering additives using HIP, as well as simultaneous joining and sintering of powder bodies of Si 2 N 2 O to Si 3 N 4 were therefore conducted. Diffusion bonding of these ceramics to the superalloy Incoloy 909 was performed by HIP at 200 MPa and 900 ºC or 1000 ºC for two hours. The thin reaction layers (apparently about 2 micrometer in thickness) were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Enrichments of titanium and niobium were detected at the interface with silicon nitride, while no such enrichments were observed when the silicon oxynitride was bonded. The main physical limitation for durable joints (intended for use up to about 700 ºC) between silicon nitride materials and superalloys is the large mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). This leads to extreme residual stresses and cracking of the ceramic. Two possible solutions to this problem were investigated: The use of a low-expansion superalloy, Incoloy 909, could reduce the residual stresses in the joint. The thermal expansion of this alloy was measured to higher temperatures than the maximum recommended temperature during use (65 OºC) since the contraction from higher joining temperatures at about 900 - 1000 ºC has a significant influence on the residual stresses in the joint after cooling. A temperature range suitable for joining without impairment of the microstructure and properties of the superalloy was determined. The relatively high average CTE of Incoloy 909 during a joining cycle, together with the serious limitations in methods suggested in the literature such as as interlayers of refractory metals such as tungsten, low-expansion alloys like Kovar or ductile metals such as nickel) lead {{to the conclusion that the}} CTE mismatch could not be sufficiently reduced by modifying only the metal part. The composition in the ceramic part of the joint should therefore be graded to increase the thermal expansion behaviour from the low CTE value in monolithic silicon nitride up to a significantly higher value at the ceramic/metal interface. Titanium nitride (TiN) and titanium diboride (TiB 2) were chosen as supplementary phases to the silicon nitride due to their suitable properties and the availability of a variety of such composites. A gradation up to 80 vol% TiN could reduce the CTE mismatch against Incoloy 909 to less than half from delta-alpha= 8. 8 micrometer/(mxK) to delta-alpha= 3. 5 micrometer/mxK). The two composites used in diffusion couples were densified by HIP from powder mixtures Of Si 3 N 4 and either 60 vol% TiN or 50 vol% TiB 2. Monolithic silicon nitride HIP ed with 2. 5 wt% Y 2 O 3 was also included in this study of interfacial reactions with Incoloy 909. A diffusion couple geometry was developed to facilitate the preparation of thin-foil specimens for examination by analytical electron microscopy (AEM). Diffusion bonding was performed by HIP at 9270 C (1200 K) and 200 MPa for four hours. The formation of reaction layers was very limited, being less than one micron in total layer thickness for all the Si 3 N 4 -based ceramics used. Two reaction products were found by AEM; a continuous, very thin, (less than or equal 100 micrometer) layer of fine TiN crystals at the initial ceramic/metal interface, and larger grains extending about 100 - 500 micrometer into the superalloy and forming a semi-continuous layer of a Gphase silicide <b>containing</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>nickel,</b> silicon and niobium. A ceramic composite, in which both the continuous fibres and the matrix consist of silicon carbide (S W), was diffusion bonded to two superalloys, Incoloy 909 and Hastelloy X, by HIP at 200 MPa and 9000 C or 10000 C for one hour. Using SEM/EDS, the reaction zones were found to consist of a thin line of carbide formers from the superalloys (Cr+Mo and Nb+Ti, respectively), bounded by several layers containing silicides and free carbon, depending on the superalloy involved. The width and composition of the reaction zones formed were found to depend more on the different compositions of the superalloys (Hastelloy X or Incoloy 909) than on a difference of 100 K in joining temperatures (1000 ºC or 900 ºC). At 1000 ºC, the reaction zones were typically about 40 micrometer thick in joints with Hastelloy X and about 100 micrometer in joints with Incoloy 909. The SiC/SiC composite was considerably more prone to reactions with superalloys compared to the behaviour Of Si 3 N 4 under similar conditions. The higher reactivity of SiC requires efficient diffusion barriers to be developed since the reaction zones formed will otherwise grow more than two orders of magnitude thicker (about 100 micrometer) than for silicon nitride ceramics under similar joining conditions.

40|$|Background: Quercetinases are metal-dependent dioxygenases of the cupin superfamily. While fungal quercetinases are copper proteins, {{recombinant}} Streptomyces quercetinase (QueD) {{was previously}} described {{to be capable}} of incorporating Ni 2 + and some other divalent metal ions. This raises the questions of which factors determine metal selection, and which metal ion is physiologically relevant. Results: Metal occupancies of heterologously produced QueD proteins followed the order Ni[*]>[*]Co[*]>[*]Fe[*]>[*]Mn. Iron, in contrast to the other metals, does not support catalytic activity. QueD isolated from the wild-type Streptomyces sp. strain FLA <b>contained</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>nickel</b> and zinc. In vitro synthesis of QueD in a cell-free transcription-translation system yielded catalytically active protein when Ni 2 + was present, and comparison of the circular dichroism spectra of in vitro produced proteins suggested that Ni 2 + ions support correct folding. Replacement of individual amino acids of the 3 His/ 1 Glu metal binding motif by alanine drastically reduced or abolished quercetinase activity and affected its structural integrity. Only substitution of the glutamate ligand (E 76) by histidine resulted in Ni- and Co-QueD variants that retained the native fold and showed residual catalytic activity. Conclusions: Heterologous formation of catalytically active, native QueD holoenzyme requires Ni 2 +, Co 2 + or Mn 2 +, i. e., metal ions that prefer an octahedral coordination geometry, and an intact 3 His/ 1 Glu motif or a 4 His environment of the metal. The observed metal occupancies suggest that metal incorporation into QueD is governed by the relative stability of the resulting metal complexes, rather than by metal abundance. Ni 2 + most likely is the physiologically relevant cofactor of QueD of Streptomyces sp. FLA. <br...|$|R

40|$|As a {{means to}} produce high {{pressure}} hydrogen {{in order to reduce}} compression penalty, we propose to reform liquid fuel (e. g., bio-ethanol) in supercritical water (pressure above 221 bar and temperature greater than 374 °C). Catalytic ethanol reforming in supercritical water for hydrogen production has been carried out in a high pressure packed bed reactor made of Inconel- 625. Since Inconel- 625 <b>contains</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>nickel,</b> it is expected that the reactor itself can be active toward ethanol reforming. Therefore, a series of tests were first performed in the empty reactor, whose results are a benchmark when studying reforming {{in the presence of a}} catalyst. Ethanol reforming in the empty reactor was studied in the temperature range of 450 to 600 °C and showed coking/plugging problem at 575 °C and above. The ethanol conversion with the empty reactor could be as high as 25 % at 550 °C and residence time of about one minute. The main reaction products with the empty reactor were H 2, CO and CH 4. A catalyst screening study was performed to investigate the performance of nickel and cobalt as active metals, supported on γ-Al 2 O 3, α-Al 2 O 3, ZrO 2 and YSZ for temperatures between 475 °C and 550 °C. The presence of the catalyst did increase the activity of ethanol reforming, especially at higher temperatures. All experiments in the catalyst screening study were carried out with non-reduced catalysts. Nickel catalysts were found more active than cobalt, likely because of higher reducibility. Indeed, the higher amount of oxygen in Co 3 O 4 compared to NiO requires more hydrogen to fully reduce the metal oxides. Both Ni/γ-Al 2 O 3 and Co/γ-Al 2 O 3 showed little activity below 500 °C, and led to failed experiments due to coking/plugging at temperatures of 525 °C and above. The strong acid sites on γ-Al 2 O 3 are responsible for high selectivity toward ethylene, a known coke precursor. The support α-Al 2 O 3 in combination with Ni was active, but yielded lower H 2 selectivity and higher CH 4 selectivity than the zirconia-based catalysts. The Co/α-Al 2 O 3 shows low activity. The ZrO 2 -based catalysts were active and yielded high H 2 selectivity, but were found very fragile. Finally, the YSZ support was strong and yielded good conversion. Below 550 °C the activity of Ni/YSZ is higher than that of Co/YSZ, but at 550 °C both catalysts yield nearly complete conversion. The advantage of Co/YSZ is then higher H 2 selectivity and lower CH 4 selectivity compared to Ni/YSZ. Therefore, Co/YSZ was selected for a more detailed study. The effect of temperature, flowrate, residence time, catalyst weight, Co loading, concentration, and pretreatment with H 2 were considered. Two methods for catalyst reduction were applied: ex-situ reduction where the catalyst is reduced in a different reactor and in-situ reduction where the catalyst is reduced in the SCW reactor prior to ethanol reforming. At 550 °C, Co/YSZ converts all ethanol for residence times as low as 2 s, even with non-reduced catalyst. At 500 °C the activity of the in-situ and ex-situ reduced catalysts were similar and greater than for the non-reduced catalyst. At 475 °C the ex-situ reduced catalyst showed low activity, comparable to that of the non-reduced catalyst, but the in-situ reduced catalyst yielded much higher conversion. The better performance of the in-situ reduced catalyst was attributed to active metal sites on the reactor’s wall after pre-treatment in H 2. The low activity of the ex-situ reduced catalyst is due to the fact that, when exposed to supercritical water for less than 30 minutes, it re-oxidized to CoO. The temperature of 475 °C is then too low to generate sufficient hydrogen that will start reducing the catalyst. Finally, analysis of reaction pathways for ethanol reforming over Co/YSZ showed that the reaction proceeds mostly via ethanol dehydrogenation to form acetaldehyde, the latter species reacting with lattice oxygen on the catalyst to produce acetone and CO 2. Acetone is then reformed by water into CO and H 2. Finally, H 2 and CO react via the methanation reaction to form CH 4. Over Co/YSZ it was found that the water-gas shift reaction is fast (CO selectivity most of the time is less than 0. 5 %), but the methanation reaction is kinetically controlled. Stopping the methanation reaction before equilibrium allowed for H 2 selectivity higher than what is expected at equilibrium (likewise, CH 4 selectivity is smaller than equilibrium value). For well-controlled reaction Co/YSZ is a promising catalyst that can be highly selective toward hydrogen during ethanol reforming in supercritical water...|$|R
