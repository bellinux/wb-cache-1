40|$|Recently, steel fibre {{reinforced}} polymers (SFRP) sheets {{have been}} introduced for the repair and rehabilitation of concrete structures. Few researchers studied the behaviour of the <b>concrete</b> <b>columns</b> wrapped with SFRP sheets; however, several critical parameters such as the cost and ductility effectiveness of the SFRP wrapped <b>concrete</b> <b>columns</b> have been lightly addressed. Thus, the main objective {{of this paper is}} to study the cost and ductility effectiveness of SFRP wrapped <b>concrete</b> <b>columns</b> and compare the results with the conventionally used carbon FRP (CFRP) wrapped <b>concrete</b> <b>columns.</b> In addition, an analytical procedure to predict the cost effectiveness of SFRP wrapped <b>concrete</b> <b>columns</b> is also suggested, from which, a parametric study was conducted. The parametric study investigated the effect of the concrete strength, the number of SFRP layers, and the size and slenderness effects on the cost effectiveness of the <b>concrete</b> <b>columns</b> wrapped with SFRP sheets. The results from the cost and ductility effectiveness study indicated that the SFRP wrapped <b>concrete</b> <b>columns</b> showed enhanced performance over the CFRP wrapped <b>concrete</b> <b>columns.</b> The suggested analytical procedure proved to be a reliable and accurate method to predict the cost effectiveness parameter of SFRP wrapped <b>concrete</b> <b>columns.</b> The parametric study showed the significant impact of the investigated parameters on the cost effectiveness of <b>concrete</b> <b>columns</b> wrapped with SFRP sheets...|$|R

An {{energy balance}} method {{has been widely}} used in extant {{literature}} to derive the ultimate axial strain of confined <b>concrete</b> <b>columns.</b> Researchers have noted that the method yields unrealistic results compared to experimental data when applied to fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) confined <b>concrete</b> <b>columns.</b> Through theoretical analyses and extensive case evaluations, this work discloses that the original equation of energy balance is invalid, not only for FRP-confined <b>concrete</b> <b>columns</b> but also for <b>concrete</b> <b>columns</b> confined by any material including steel stirrups. Rational reasoning shows that to achieve the energy balance, a modification factor related to confinement should be applied. Using the modified energy balance method, a new model for the ultimate axial strain of FRP-confined circular <b>concrete</b> <b>columns</b> is developed.

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} were undertaken on {{high strength}} wire (HSW) confined <b>concrete</b> <b>columns.</b> Fifteen columns were tested {{with the variation}} of confinement pressure that was achieved by changing the winding spacing of HSW. The stress-strain response, peak strength and strain, ultimate strain, and failure modes of the columns were investigated. The experimental results showed that winding HSW is an effective and efficient method of column jacketing that can significantly increase column strength and ductility. The failure mode of HSW confined <b>concrete</b> <b>columns</b> showed successive fractures of HSW with increased ductility and abundant warning compared with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) jacketed columns. The test {{results show that the}} existing framework for stress-strain modeling of ordinary steel spiral confined <b>concrete</b> <b>columns</b> is generally applicable to HSW confined <b>concrete</b> <b>columns.</b> However, the parameters of the stress-strain model must be revised to suit the significantly different characteristics of the new confining material. Using the test results from this work and other data collected from the literature, an improved stress-strain model is developed which is applicable not only to HSW confined <b>concrete</b> <b>columns</b> but also to ordinary steel spiral confined <b>concrete</b> <b>columns.</b> The proposed model shows an improved performance compared with existing models reported in the literature...|$|R

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of 10 spirally reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>columns</b> and 5 plain <b>concrete</b> <b>columns</b> {{subjected to}} a concentric compressive load is investigated. The reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>columns</b> were designed using the CSA A 23. 3 - 94 Standard. The experimental specimens were made of concretes with compressive strengths ranging from 35 MPa to 125 MPa. Two types of steel spiral reinforcement, Grade 400 and Grade 500, were used to investigate {{the ability of a}} higher yield strength steel to confine the concrete core. The response of the reinforced specimens is compared to predictions using a stress-strain model for confined concrete. The determination of the predicted response is based on the computation of a load-strain response using the effective confining stresses in the concrete core. The effects of the concrete compressive strength and the steel spiral tensile strength on the load-strain response are investigated. The peak loads of the spirally reinforced circular <b>concrete</b> <b>columns</b> are compared to the peak loads predicted by our current codes of practice.

The influence of column slenderness ratio on their axial load capacity, axial strains, and radial strains is also investigated.
