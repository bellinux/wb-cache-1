40|$|ABSTRACT – This paper {{presents}} a new algorithm for timingdriven cell placement using {{the notion of}} movable Steiner points that capture the net topology. The proposed algorithm improves the timing closure at the backend of the EDA design <b>flow.</b> Unlike <b>conventional</b> <b>flows</b> that perform placement and routing in two separate steps and use rough estimates of the net lengths during placement, our algorithm uses accurate net lengths by considering the net topologies during the Elmore delay calculation step and dynamically updates the routing during the concurrent placement of Steiner points and cells. The simultaneous placement and routing problem is formulated as a mathematical program with {{a small number of}} variables and solved by the Han-Powell method. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach compared to the <b>conventional</b> <b>flows.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFlow cytometry, {{initially}} {{developed to}} analyze surface protein expression in hematopoietic cells, {{has increased in}} analytical complexity and is now widely used to identify cells from different tissues and organisms. As a consequence, data analysis became increasingly difficult due the need of large multi-parametric compensation matrices and to the eventual auto-fluorescence frequently found in cell suspensions obtained from solid organs. In contrast with <b>conventional</b> <b>flow</b> cytometry that detects the emission peak of fluorochromes, spectral flow cytometry distinguishes the shapes of emission spectra along a large range of continuous wave lengths. The data is analyzed with an algorithm that replaces compensation matrices and treats auto-fluorescence as an independent parameter. Thus, spectral flow cytometry should be capable to discriminate fluorochromes with similar emission peaks and provide multi-parametric analysis without compensation requirements. Here we show that spectral flow cytometry achieves a 21 -parametric (19 fluorescent probes) characterization and deals with auto-fluorescent cells, providing high resolution of specifically fluorescence-labeled populations. Our results showed that spectral flow cytometry has advantages {{in the analysis of}} cell populations of tissues difficult to characterize in <b>conventional</b> <b>flow</b> cytometry, such as heart and intestine.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{order to}} {{understand}} the effect of aerodynamic intake loads on the F- 111 FS 496 nacelle former and surrounding intake structure, an “envelope ” approach has been developed for the stress analysis of FS 496 when the distributions of air pressure along the intake wall are not known. This approach assumes that the distributions of the air pressures along the wall of the intake structure are within an envelope. The envelope is defined based on three fluid dynamic theory approaches: <b>conventional</b> incompressible <b>flow,</b> <b>conventional</b> compressible <b>flow,</b> and a new pseudo-compressible flow approach. The simplified pseudo-compressible approach produced similar predictions to the more complex conventional compressible approach.

Our observations of a terminal solidlike behavior are thus interpreted by Collin and Martinoty as an anomaly induced by compression effects. We clearly refute this interpretation.

Despite reported limitations of this technique, MV levels obtained using <b>conventional</b> <b>flow</b> cytometry have yielded many clinically relevant findings, such as associations with disease severity and ability to predict clinical outcomes. This study aims to determine if MV enumeration by flow cytometry correlates with a measurement of their functional capacity, as this may explain how flow cytometry generates clinically relevant results. METHODS: one hundred samples from healthy individuals and patients with obstructive sleep apnoea were analysed by <b>conventional</b> <b>flow</b> cytometry (facscalibur) and by three functional mv assays: Zymuphen MP-activity in which data were given as phosphatidylserine equivalent, STA(®) Phospholipid Procoag Assay expressed as clotting time and Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP) reflecting in vitro thrombin generation. Correlations were determined by Spearman correlation. RESULTS: Absolute counts of lactadherin+ procoagulant MVs generated by flow cytometry weakly correlated with the results obtained from the Zymuphen MP-activity (r= 0. 5370, p< 0. 0001); correlated with ETP (r= 0. 7444, p< 0. 0001); negatively correlated with STA(®) Phospholipid Procoag Assay clotting time (- 0. 7872, p< 0. 0001), reflecting a positive correlation between clotting activity and flow cytometry. Levels of Annexin V+ procoagulant and platelet-derived MVs were also associated with functional assays. Absolute counts of MVs derived from other cell types were not correlated with the functional results. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative results of procoagulant and platelet-derived MVs from <b>conventional</b> <b>flow</b> cytometry are associated with the functional capability of the MVs, as defined by three functional MV assays.
