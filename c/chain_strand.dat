40|$|Unpredictable {{fracture}} of round steel link chains reduce the economic {{efficiency of the}} machines they are used in and increase the hazard potential for the operating personnel. In order to reduce such incidents appropriate measures for early detection are needed to determine an optimum time of repair or replacement. By steadily increasing strain, the currently applied, discontinuous and manually performed control processes does not present a satisfactory solution. They should be supplemented with new, {{the current state of}} the art considering approaches. This thesis addresses these issues and depicts the evaluation results of an individually developed measurement system for chains including the acquisition and processing of lifetime related variables. The focus hereby lies on standardized round steel link chains, which are preferably used in mining or in the hoisting equipment. Relevant damages to chains can be largely attributed to mechanical overstress of the base material. Typical damage patterns are fatigue fractures and forced fractures that are favoured depending on the environmental conditions, through wear and corrosion. As well-proven approach to estimate the remaining lifetime, the method of calculation of service strength was established. In adaptation to the use case chain, a component specific S-N curve and a nominal-stress-time-curve associated to collective stress are required. Subsequently, both are linked by the linear damage accumulation hypothesis. The chain specific S-N curve was created on the basis of previous trials of WBK Seilprüfstelle. The conducted dynamic fatigue trials respect a wide range of standardized chain sizes and rely on two different load assumptions. Thus a weighted consideration of the real load conditions is possible. By using the two parametric Markov counting algorithm, the collective normal stress will be calculated. Essential for this is an accurate load-time-curve that comprises of the real surrounding conditions precisely. For an accurate determination of the replacement state, the generated collective must represent the complete history of the chain link. This important requirement can only be achieved by a constantly working measurement system, which is directly connected to the focused link over the entire service life. A market research concerning established and free accessible measurement systems for chains revealed no satisfactory solution also complying with the elaborate chain specific requests. For this purpose, the development of a customized measurement system was focus of the public funded research project i-MaSS (integrated machine sensor system). For the integration of the miniaturized and energy-efficient prototypes in the <b>chain</b> <b>strand,</b> customized adapters are required. With regard to the minimal installation space available a conceptual division respective to the layout took place here. For chains with a wire gauge ≥ 30 mm (preferable mining chains) the developed adapter element looks like a stud chain link with a borehole in the middle. Wire gauges < 30 mm (e. g. hoisting chains) can not house the measurement systems directly as a consequence of the filigree geometry. In this regard an alternative solution was designed which can be mounted in the flow of force at the end of the <b>chain</b> <b>strand.</b> The testing of each adapter variant was performed on different test rigs for mining and hoisting chains separately. For the considered use case mining chain static test series were carried on a horizontally operating tension testing machine; dynamic analyses on a close to reality but unloaded armoured face conveyor test bench. The results obtained depict a linear and reproducible transmission behaviour of the complete measurement chain. The for chain hoists designed concept was trialled on a seven meter high test tower under realistic conditions. Hereby, the performed static and dynamic test series reveal a satisfying transmission behaviour, which is furthermore repeatable and analytically traceable. All test bench trials achieved acceptable results for both developed measurement concepts. Therefore, they can be used as a practicable tool for determining the load-time-curve of adequate quality. In conjunction with the deduced and for chains adapted calculation of service strength, it is now possible to estimate the remaining life time of standardized round link chains of different size more precisely...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In {{previous}} studies on propagation of simulated action potentials (APs) in cardiac muscle using PSpice modeling, we {{reported that a}} second black-box (BB) could not be inserted into the K + leg of the basic membrane unit because that caused the PSpice program to become very unstable. Therefore, only the rising phase of the APs could be simulated. This restriction was acceptable since only the mechanism of transmission of excitation from one cell to the next was being investigated. Methods and results We have now been able to repolarize the AP by inserting a second BB into the Na + leg of the basic units. This second BB effectively mimicked deactivation of the Na + channel conductance. This produced repolarization of the AP, not by activation of K + conductance, but by deactivation of the Na + conductance. The propagation of complete APs was studied in a <b>chain</b> (<b>strand)</b> of 10 cardiac muscle cells, in which various numbers of gap-junction (gj) channels (assumed to be 100 pS each) were inserted across the cell junctions. The shunt resistance across the junctions produced by the gj-channels (R gj) was varied from 100, 000 M? (0 gj-channels) to 10, 000 M? (1 gj-channel), to 1, 000 M? (10 channels), to 100 M? (100 channels), and 10 M? (1000 channels). The velocity of propagation (θ, in cm/s) was calculated from the measured total propagation time (TPT, the time difference between when the AP rising phase of the first cell and the last cell crossed - 20 mV, assuming a cell length of 150 μm. When there were no gj-channels, or only a few, the transmission of excitation between cells was produced by the electric field (EF), i. e. the negative junctional cleft potential, that is generated in the narrow junctional clefts (e. g. 100 A) when the prejunctional membrane fires an AP. When there were many gj-channels (e. g. 1000 or 10, 000), the transmission of excitation was produced by local-circuit current flow from one cell to the next through the gj-channels. Conclusion We have now been able to simulate complete APs in cardiac muscle cells that could propagate along a single chain of 10 cells, even {{when there were no}} gj-channels between the cells. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Previously, {{only the}} rising {{phase of the}} action {{potential}} (AP) in cardiac muscle and smooth muscle could be simulated due to the instability of PSpice upon insertion of a second black box (BB) into the K + leg of the basic membrane unit. This restriction was acceptable because only the transmission of excitation from one cell to the next was investigated. Methods In the current work, the repolarization of the AP was accomplished by inserting a second BB into the Ca ++ leg of the basic membrane unit. Repolarization of the AP was produced, not through an activation of the K + channel conductance, but rather through a mimicking of the deactivation of the Ca ++ channel conductance. Propagation of complete APs was studied in a <b>chain</b> (<b>strand)</b> of 10 smooth muscle cells, in which various numbers of gap-junction (gj) channels (assumed to be 100 pS each) were inserted across the cell junctions. Results The shunt resistance across the junctions produced by the gj-channels (R gj) was varied from 100, 000 MΩ (0 gj-channels) to 10, 000 MΩ (1 gj-channel), to 1, 000 MΩ (10 channels), to 100 MΩ (100 channels), to 10 MΩ (1000 channels), and to 1. 0 MΩ (10, 000 channels). Velocity of propagation (θ, in cm/sec) was calculated from the measured total propagation time (TPT, the time difference between when the AP rising phase of the first cell and the last cell crossed - 20 mV), assuming a constant cell length of 200 μm. When there were no gj-channels, or only one, the transmission of excitation between cells was produced by the electric field (EF), i. e., the negative junctional cleft potential, that is generated in the narrow junctional clefts (e. g., 100 A) when the prejunctional membrane fires an AP (a fraction of a millisecond before the adjacent surface membrane). There were significant end-effects at the termination of the strand, such that the last cell (cell # 10) failed to fire, or fired after a prolonged delay. This end-effect was abolished when the strand termination resistance (R bt) was increased from 1. 0 KΩ to 600 MΩ. When there were 1000 or 10, 000 gj-channels, the transmission of excitation was produced by local-circuit current flow from one cell to the next through the gj-channels.

Polymeric beads consist of several Kuhn segments, and their motion is {{dictated by the}} Helmholtz energy of the sample, which is a sum of the entropic elasticity of <b>chain</b> <b>strands</b> between beads, slip springs, and nonbonded interactions. The entanglement effect is introduced by the slip springs, which are springs connecting either nonsuccessive beads on the same chain or beads on different polymer chains. The terminal positions of slip springs are altered during the simulation through a kinetic Monte Carlo hopping scheme, with rate-controlled creation/destruction processes for the slip springs at chain ends. The rate constants {{are consistent with the}} free energy function employed and satisfy microscopic reversibility at equilibrium. The free energy of nonbonded interactions is derived from an appropriate equation of state, and it is computed as a functional of the local density by passing an orthogonal grid through the simulation box; accounting for it is necessary for reproducing the correct compressibility of the polymeric material.

40|$|Clinical outcome prognostication in {{oncology}} is {{a guiding}} principle in therapeutic choice. A wealth of qualitative empirical evidence links disease progression with tumor morphology, histopathology, invasion, and associated molecular phenomena. However, the quantitative contribution {{of each of}} the known parameters in this progression remains elusive. Mathematical modeling can provide the capability to quantify the connection between variables governing growth, prognosis, and treatment outcome. By quantifying the link between the tumor boundary morphology and the invasive phenotype, this work provides a quantitative tool for the study of tumor progression and diagnostic/prognostic applications. This establishes a framework for monitoring system perturbation towards development of therapeutic strategies and correlation to clinical outcome for prognosis. Major Findings: We apply a biologically founded, multiscale, mathematical model to identify and quantify tumor biologic and molecular properties relating to clinical and morphological phenotype and to demonstrate that tumor growth and invasion are predictable processes governed by biophysical laws, and regulated by heterogeneity in phenotypic, genotypic, and microenvironmental parameters. This heterogeneity drives migration and proliferation of more aggressive clones up cell substrate gradients within and beyond the central tumor mass, while often also inducing loss of cell adhesion.

In the crystal, the mol­ecule adopts a non-symmetric conformation. The carbazole ring system is approximately planar [maximum {{deviation from the}} least-squares plane = 0. 039  (2)  Å]. The planes of the carbazole unit and the benzene rings subtend dihedral angles of 48. 42  (7) and 41. 81  (6) °. The dihedral angles between the planes of the nitro­phenyl rings and the nitro groups are 44. 34  (19) and 61. 64  (15) °. The crystal is built from two strands of parallel mol­ecules with inter­digitated octyl <b>chains.</b> These <b>strands</b> are symmetry related by a twofold screw axis...|$|R
40|$|Three-hundred ninety-two adult Dermacentor variabilis were {{collected}} from six Maryland counties during the spring, summer, and fall of 2002. Infection prevalence for spotted fever group Rickettsia was 3. 8 %, as determined by polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction. Single <b>strand</b> conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis followed by sequencing indicated that all infections represented a single rickettsial taxon, Rickettsia montanensis.

40|$|We compare {{results of}} {{previous}} simulations {{of a simple}} model of DNA denaturation to the predictions of the Poland-Scheraga model. Concentrating on the critical region of the latter model we calculate both thermodynamic quantities and the distribution functions measured in the simulations. We find that the Poland-Scheraga model yields {{an excellent fit to}} the data, provided (i) we include a (singular) factor weighting the open ends of the doubly <b>stranded</b> <b>chain,</b> and (ii) we keep the leading corrections to the finite size scaling limit. The exponent c_ 1, which governs the end-weighting factor, is fairly well determined: 0. 1 <~ c_ 1 <~ 0. 15. The exponent c, which governs the length distribution of large loops, is determined only poorly. The data are compatible with values of c in at least the range 1. 9 <~ c <~ 2. 2. From the data it therefore cannot be decided whether the denaturation transition asymptotically is of first or of second order. We suggest that simulations of doubly <b>stranded</b> <b>chains</b> closed at both ends might allow for a more precise determination of c...|$|R
40|$|We {{have applied}} the {{technique}} of PCR-SSCP (polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction-single <b>stranded</b> conformation polymorphism) to characterise the molecular basis of cholinesterase deficiency and variants in a Jordanian family. PCR-SSCP {{proved to be a}} quick and sensitive method of screening cholinesterase variants in a clinical setting. An AG insertion at position 351 was found to cause a silent allele, for which the parents were heterozygous and three children homozygous. In addition, the father and two sons were heterozygous for an A to G transition at position 209, known to cause the dibucaine resistant variant. No linkage to the K variant was found, which has been reported previously in white populations. These findings suggest considerable homogeneity in the molecular basis of CHE variants between different ethnic groups...|$|R
50|$|Polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction-single <b>strand</b> {{conformation}} polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) {{method was}} used to determine the growth hormone (GH), leptin, calpain, and calpastatin polymorphism in Iranian Baluchi male sheep. An artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed to describe average daily gain (ADG) in lambs from input parameters of GH, leptin, calpain, and calpastatin polymorphism, birth weight, and birth type. The results revealed that the ANN-model is an appropriate tool to recognize the patterns of data to predict lamb growth in terms of ADG given specific genes polymorphism, birth weight, and birth type. The platform of PCR-SSCP approach and ANN-based model analyses may be used in molecular marker-assisted selection and breeding programs to design a scheme in enhancing the efficacy of sheep production.|$|R
