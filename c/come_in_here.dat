500|$|The Big 12 Championship Game {{is held by}} the Big 12 Conference each year. The {{championship}} game pits the Big 12 North Division champion against the South Division champion in a game held after the regular season has been completed. Despite losing {{the last two games}} of the regular season, Colorado retained {{the best record in the}} North Division of the Big 12 Conference. Prior to the game, Colorado head coach Gary Barnett said, [...] "I do not think anybody expects us to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> and beat Texas." [...] His team lost the game 70–3, the most lopsided score in any college football conference championship to date.|$|E
500|$|In February, Dodd {{turned his}} {{attention}} fully to the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire. When asked by the Associated Press {{on the campaign trail}} if his campaigning really made a difference in changing public perceptions, he replied, [...] "There is enough time yet to change this , because there are places like Iowa and New Hampshire that give candidates like myself a chance to be heard." [...] Dodd's strategy was to speak to voters in restaurants, homes, and small-town diners, although political analysts wondered whether such methods were out-of-date. But he maintained that [...] "chatting in a living room face to face is still a very important feature of campaigning here. I don't think you can <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> and do sort of a wholesale political operation from [...] with a pit stop here and there and a media campaign behind you." [...] At the end of February, Dodd differentiated himself from his Democratic counterparts by stating his support for the Bush administration's willingness to hold joint talks with Iran and Syria and by stating that as president he would avoid talking with Iran as long as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad remained as president. On the trail, he referred to Ahmadinejad as a [...] "thug".|$|E

2500|$|When Basie {{took his}} {{orchestra}} to New York in 1937, {{they made the}} Woodside Hotel in Harlem their base (they often rehearsed in its basement). Soon, they were booked at the Roseland Ballroom for the Christmas show. Basie recalled a review, which said something like, [...] "We caught the great Count Basie band {{which is supposed to}} be so hot he was going to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> and set the Roseland on fire. [...] Well, the Roseland is still standing". Compared to the reigning band of Fletcher Henderson, Basie's band lacked polish and presentation.|$|E
2500|$|Graham drew {{criticism}} from blogs on the Left and the Right for comments about Bill and Hillary Clinton made on CNN Headline News' Glenn Beck Show on June 20, 2007. Referring to a Clinton campaign ad {{based on the}} final episode of The Sopranos, Graham said [...] "...didn't you at some point want to see, like, Paulie Walnuts, somebody <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> and just whack them both right there? Wouldn't that have been great?...Come on! Where's [...] "Big Pussy"? Come on! Let's make it happen...I wanted that." [...] Beck {{did not agree with}} Graham's comments.|$|E

I {{was about to go}} down the {{elevator}} to get in that thing...I say, why don't we meet outside in the tunnel after the ball game and get it on some more? You don't come into the OB, baby.

2500|$|Jazz {{historian}} and commentator Ira Gitler declared that Tatum's [...] "left hand was {{the equal of}} his right." [...] When Bud Powell was opening for Tatum at Birdland around 1950, {{the end of an}} era when musicians engaged in overt competition and so-called cutting sessions, Powell reportedly said to Tatum, [...] "Man, I'm going to really show you about tempo and playing fast. [...] Anytime you're ready." [...] Tatum laughed and replied, [...] "Look, you <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> tomorrow, and anything you do with your right hand, I'll do with my left." [...] Powell never took up the challenge. Of note was Tatum's double-time stride playing, where his left hand alternated between playing bass notes (or tenth intervals) and mid-range chords at high speed, a device he used in showcase recordings like [...] "I Wish I Were Twins", [...] "The Shout", and [...] "Elegy".|$|E
2500|$|Along with Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt, she {{released}} Trio (1987) to critical acclaim. The album revitalized Parton's music career, spending five weeks at number one [...] on Billboard's Country Albums chart, and also {{reached the top}} 10 on Billboard's Top-200 Albums chart. It sold several million copies and produced four Top 10 country hits, including Phil Spector's [...] "To Know Him Is to Love Him," [...] which went to number one. Trio won the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award for Album of the Year. After a further attempt at pop success with Rainbow, (1987) including the single [...] "The River Unbroken," [...] Parton focused on recording country material. White Limozeen (1989) produced two number one [...] hits in [...] "Why'd You <b>Come</b> <b>in</b> <b>Here</b> Lookin' Like That" [...] and [...] "Yellow Roses." [...] Although Parton's career appeared to be revived, it was actually just a brief revival before contemporary country music came on in the early 1990s and moved most veteran artists off the chart.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the next}} winter night, Gerda's {{grandmother}} tells {{the two children}} {{the legend of the}} Snow Queen. [...] The viewer is taken to the Snow Queen's palace of ice in the far north (on Spitsbergen) where she sits on her throne and looks into her mirror. The Snow Queen's proud and frowning face is seen by Gerda through a frosted window who exclaims, [...] "It's the Snow Queen!". Kay jokes, [...] "Let her <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here,</b> and I'll put her on a hot stove!". This angers the Snow Queen, who is watching the children in her mirror, who becomes angry and smashes the mirror with her scepter. [...] The ice splinters of the shattered mirror go into the eyes and hearts of those who have offended her. Back at Gerda's home, the window bursts open and ice splinters enter Kay's eyes and heart. He becomes hostile toward Gerda, and when Gerda sees that the cold wind and snow have killed blackened their roses, Kay stomps on them and kicks them about in glee. He then leaves Gerda in tears to be comforted by her grandmother.|$|E

2500|$|After {{splitting}} {{his time}} in the 2013 season between the Fightin Phils and the Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs (Class AAA – International League), Buchanan attended a Prospect Education Program hosted by the Phillies organization in January 2014. At the time, {{he was the only one}} of the eight attendees who had not been invited to major league camp at spring training, however after taking a [...] "leadership role" [...] at the program, Joe Jordan (the Phillies' director of player development) and manager Ryne Sandberg tendered Buchanan an invitation to big league camp. He entered camp competing for a spot in the Phillies rotation, and impressed the Phillies' staff, ultimately becoming a finalist for the position with Jeff Manship. He did not make the opening day roster despite his strong performance, but would remain in consideration for promotion during the 2014 season, particularly as a spot starter or even the Phillies' fifth starter if needed due to injury. Buchanan commented, [...] "I wanted to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> and make an impression and open us some eyes and I feel like I did that. I feel like I proved myself that I am ready for the next level. I had a blast every day in camp." ...|$|E
