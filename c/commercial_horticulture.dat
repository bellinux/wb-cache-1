30|$|Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a rod-shaped, Gram-positive soil {{bacterium}} {{characterized by}} {{its ability to}} produce crystalline inclusions called “Cry proteins, Cry toxins or Bt toxins” during sporulation. The crystalline inclusions along with the spores have a high potential to control {{a great number of}} insect pests belonging to the order Lepidoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera (Vidyarthi et al. 2002; Yamamoto and Dean 2000). B. thuringiensis can be found in different substrates such as soil, water, plant surfaces, dead insects, grain dust, and stored grain (Glare and O’Callaghan 2000; Valicente and Barreto 2003), and it is a useful alternative or zment to synthetic chemical pesticide applications in <b>commercial</b> agriculture, <b>horticulture,</b> forest management, and mosquito control (De Maagd et al. 1999). B. thuringiensis also has high genetic variability and are widely distributed in nature (Vilas-Boas et al. 2002 Martin and Travers 1989 Hossain et al. 1997). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used to identify specific cry genes and characterize B. thuringiensis strains {{with a high degree of}} success (Chak et al. 1994; Cerón et al. 19941995; Shangkuan et al. 2001; Lima et al. 2002; Valicente et al., 2010).|$|R
40|$|For on-line plant {{monitoring}} equipment to be functional in <b>commercial</b> glasshouse <b>horticulture,</b> relations between sensor readings and plant responses {{on both the}} short (days) and long term (weeks) are required. For this reason, systems were installed to monitor rockwool grown gerbera plants on a minute-to-minute basis from July 2002 until April 2003. Data collected included, amongst others, crop transpiration from lysimeter data (2 m 2), canopy temperature using infrared sensors, rockwool water content, and greenhouse climatic parameters, such as global radiation and temperature. By combining data from lysimeter and water content, changes in crop fresh weight could be calculated on a daily basis. Both transpiration and daily fresh weight production were better related to light integral as measured inside the greenhouse, than outside the greenhouse. The contribution of heating pipes underneath the canopy to transpiration could be estimated with the system. From the relation between daily FW production and previous day light integral, a light use efficiency of ca. 10 -g FW/MJ solar radiation as measured inside the greenhouse was calculated. Water use efficiency was on average 25 g FW/L. A 3 - 4 day drying cycle did not affect flower production. The results underline the importance of knowledge on the adaptation and tolerance of crops to stressful conditions, {{in order to be}} able to use plant monitoring under grower conditions effectively...|$|R
5|$|Agriculture, {{which was}} once a major {{occupation}} {{of the people of}} Dakshina Kannada, has taken a backseat because of the influx of money from natives settled in other cities, states and countries. Significant number of people from this district work in the Gulf (Middle East) countries and other states of India. Farms and fields are being converted into residential plots and <b>commercial</b> (shopping) complexes. <b>Horticulture,</b> though, has made some strides, and measures have been taken to improve the fruit plantation sector. The main crops of Dakshina Kannada are Paddy, Coconut, Arecanut, Black Pepper, Cashew and Cocoa. Rubber, Banana and Vanilla crops are also cultivated in the Sullia taluk. Rice is generally cultivated three seasons in a year, Karthika or Yenel (May–October), Suggi (October to January) and Kolake (January to April). Urad (Black gram) is grown in some areas during the season of Suggi. The Karnataka Milk Federation has a milk processing plant at Kulshekar in Mangalore. This plant processes milk procured from the cattle owned by farmers of the district.|$|R

He was at a dig in Ordrup Cemetery 1910-27 (partly brought on his horticultural land around his house, official residence in 1914). He was editor of Gardener Journal of Denmark (Gartner-Tidende) 1905-7 and secretary of General Gardener Association of Denmark (Almindelig Gartnerforening), consultant for the municipality of Gentofte in park issues 1921, member for the publication of Danish Manor House Gardens (Danske Herregaardshaver) and The Royal Danish Garden Society (Det Kongelige Danske Haveselskab), 1924-28.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the site}} is given over to <b>commercial</b> <b>horticulture.</b> There is a garden centre on the site, trading as Blooms of Bressingham, {{although}} the nurseries themselves are not open to the public. Bressingham Gardens and Steam Museum is an independent charitable trust. Alan Bloom had wanted to create his own trust in 1967, {{to ensure that the}} collection would not be disbursed to pay for death duties, but the laws of the time made this difficult, and after five years of negotiation, the museum was nearly handed over to the Transport Trust. However, the legislation governing private museums was relaxed just before the handover in 1971, and Bloom was able to create his own Trust and thus retain control of it because the collection was of historical and educational importance.|$|E
50|$|The Orland P. Bassett House, and the {{accompanying}} carriage house, were constructed in 1899. Bassett {{began his career as}} a printer, moving to Chicago manage the Pictorial Printing Company in 1874. He moved to Hinsdale with his wife in 1887 and began cultivating roses as a hobby. In 1888, he created a hybrid rose known as the American Beauty rose in his greenhouse. He co-founded Bassett & Washburn, which became the first florist to distribute the rose. <b>Commercial</b> <b>horticulture</b> was a relatively new field as Americans had only gained significant disposable income late in the 19th century. One of their largest clients was the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, who purchased the roses for use in their dining cars. The company was the largest employer in Hinsdale in 1900. Bassett retired in 1907, passing the business to his son-in-law, and moved to Pasadena, California in 1910. Bassett's grandson Egdar Washburn lived in the residence until 1913, when it was sold to Quaker Oats treasurer Robert Gordon. The house was renovated in 1942.|$|E
40|$|The Tamborine Mt area is {{a popular}} {{residential}} and tourist area in the Gold Coast hinterland, SE Qld. The 15 km 2 area occurs on elevated remnant Tertiary Basalts of the Beechmont Group, which comprise a number of mappable flow units originally derived from the Tweed volcanic centre to the south. The older Albert Basalt (Tertiary), which underlies the Beechmont Basalt {{at the southern end}} of the investigation area, is thought to be derived from the Focal Peak volcanic centre to the south west. The Basalts contain a locally significant ‘un-declared’ groundwater resource, which is utilised by the Tamborine Mt community for: •	domestic purposes to supplement rainwater tank supplies, •	<b>commercial</b> scale <b>horticulture</b> and •	<b>commercial</b> export off-Mountain for bottled water. There is no reticulated water supply, and all waste water is treated on-site through domestic scale WTPs. Rainforest and other riparian ecosystems that attract residents and tourist dollars to the area, are also reliant on the groundwater that discharges to springs and surface streams on and around the plateau. Issues regarding a lack of compiled groundwater information, groundwater contamination, and groundwater sustainability are being investigated by QUT, utilising funding provided by the Federal Government’s ‘Caring for our Country’ programme through SEQ Catchments Ltd. The objectives of the two year project, which started in April 2009, are to: •	Characterise the nature and condition of groundwater / surface water systems in the Tamborine Mountain area in terms of the issues being raised; •	Engage and build capacity within the community to source local knowledge, encourage participation, raise awareness and improve understanding of the impacts of land and water use; •	Develop a stand-alone 3 D Visualisation model for dissemination into the community and use as a communication tool. ...|$|R
40|$|Water is {{now being}} given as the major setback to {{development}} in many areas, especially when <b>commercial</b> irrigation and <b>horticulture</b> have become significant economic activities. At the local level, such activities can have significant impacts on other water services such as drinking water availability. It is therefore important that each stakeholder maintains a sustainable level of water use, especially in countries deemed water scarce. Kenya is such a country and where horticultural and floriculture have increasingly become important in efforts towards eradicating poverty, and have been said to hold huge potential for growth. The study adopted a critical observational nature in combining and comparing the supply and demand aspect of water from Burguret catchment. In order to address the aim of examining water use sustainability of the cut-flower industry, the study sought to firstly establish the baseline conditions. The scope set out to utilize the irrigation quantities and patterns of a selected flower farm (Tambuzi) that gets its water from the catchment under study (Burguret catchment). The aim was to utilize these findings as {{a microcosm of the}} wider picture. The assessment for water use sustainability was found to be within catchment limits based on a single farm scenario on the catchment. In the secondary scenario, where five farms of the same capacity were assumed, the study found that although irrigation use for cut flowers were approaching population demand, the overall water demand was well within the catchment’s discharge levels. Although the conclusions found irrigation consumption within sustainable limits in terms of river discharge, the rate of change warrants stronger consideration of sustainable management and resilience.

40|$|Rapid {{expansion}} of <b>commercial</b> <b>horticulture</b> production and related activities contribute to declining surface water quality. The {{study sought to}} understand the impacts on select rivers in Laikipia and Meru, production hotspots. The specific aims were (1) to identify prevailing surface water quality by examining variations of 14 physico-chemical parameters, and (2) to categorize measured surface water quality parameters into land use types highlighting potential pollutant source processes. Water samples were collected in July and August 2013 along 14 rivers in the study area. The {{data were analyzed using}} principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis (DA). Principal components (PCs) explained 70 % of the observed total variability of water quality, indicating a prevalence of heavy metal traces (cadmium, phosphate, and zinc). These were linked to the rigorous use of phosphate fertilizers and copper-based agrochemicals in intensive farming. DA provided four significant (p < 0. 05) discriminant functions, with 89. 5 % correct assignment enabling the association of land use with observed water quality. Concentrations of dissolved solids, electro-conductivity, and salinity spiked at locations with intensive small-scale and large-scale horticulture. Understanding the impacts of intensive <b>commercial</b> <b>horticulture</b> and land use practices on water quality is critical to formulating ecologically sound watershed management and pollution abatement plans...|$|E
40|$|Greenhouse <b>commercial</b> <b>horticulture</b> in Kenya started {{more than}} two decades ago and has evolved to be a {{significant}} sector to the national economy. So far no studies have explored the spatial patterns and dynamics of the area under greenhouse cultivation. Google Earth archives alongside data from various portals provided an opportunity to study those farms’ spatial distribution. The roles of selected topo-edaphic, infrastructure and demographics factors that might influence current location within sub-watersheds in central highlands of Kenya are also examined. Results reveal a non-uniform spread with two high clusters; one in the semi-arid sub-watersheds 3 AB shared by Kajiado and Machakos districts and the other is in sub-humid sub-watersheds 3 BA shared by Kiambu and Nairobi districts. Multivariate linear regression analysis reveals four statistically significant parameters; population density (p < 0. 01), number of dams (p < 0. 01), average rainfall (p < 0. 01) and average slope (p < 0. 05) in predicting the number of greenhouse farms. Soil attributes are not significantly related with greenhouse farming in this study. Findings indicate that greenhouse <b>commercial</b> <b>horticulture</b> is heterogeneous, and rapidly expanding beyond the central highlands towards marginal semi-arid zones in Kenya.

40|$|The lack {{of water}} in many {{agricultural}} areas justifies the increasing pressure from other water-use sectors to optimize irrigation practices. The answer from the scientific community to this challenge {{is the development of}} new approaches and techniques for a more efficient use of water in <b>commercial</b> <b>horticulture.</b> Here we address what we believe are major research topics supporting some of the latest achievements in this field. First, improving our knowledge on crop water relations is crucial for saving water and increasing the water use efficiency by plants. This not only helps us to identify key mechanisms controlling the use of water by the crop; it also allows us to build mechanistic models that can be used as tools to improve crop production systems and management. In addition, it provides us with the required knowledge to develop deficit irrigation strategies, which are compulsory in many areas where water for irrigation is scarce. The use of low quality water for irrigation is also becoming common in those areas. Therefore, the study of its effects both on soils and crops is increasingly relevant. We finally consider remote sensing techniques that are being developed for dealing with the high variability normally found in big, heterogeneous commercial systems: these new tools improve the sampling procedures, both of the soil and plant water status, and allows us to identify quickly and with minimum labor resources for the within-farm variability of crop water status. Both applications greatly improve the efficiency of the irrigation practice in <b>commercial</b> <b>horticulture...</b>|$|E
40|$|Gardening is {{a popular}} pastime, but <b>commercial</b> <b>horticulture</b> is {{responsible}} for the introduction of alien species and contributes to invasions in a variety of ways. Although an extensive international literature is available on plant invasions, it is still important at the national level to examine the influence of local factors. Accordingly, 17 nurseries in Estonia that cultivated and sold perennial alien species were selected, and a list of species and prices was compiled. The relationships between species status, and factors such as their abundance in the wild were examined statistically. A qualitative list of the nationally problematic species among herbaceous perennials was also completed. A total of 880 taxa were recorded, of which 10. 3 % were native and 89. 7 % alien. In all, 87. 3 % of the alien species were still confined to cultivated areas. The ecological and socio-economic characteristics of the taxa were described, and lists of the families of casual, naturalised and invasive aliens were provided. Both native and increasing wild alien species have a very similar profile on the market. Alien species that are less expensive, widely available and have more cultivars per species on the market {{are also more likely to}} escape. The invasive status and abundance of escaped aliens in an area increases with residence time. In general, socio-economic factors create new and reflect previous propagule pressures from <b>commercial</b> <b>horticulture,</b> which continuously increase the likelihood of alien species surviving and invading new areas. Our findings suggest that these national socioeconomic market-related factors explain much of the invasiveness of various perennial ornamental species, and therefore regional and national authorities urgently need to regulate and control the ornamental plant trade to diminish the risk of new invasions...|$|E

40|$|A growing {{consciousness}} of health hazards in using and handling chemical substances for <b>commercial</b> <b>horticulture</b> {{has created a}} need for non-chemical methods {{as a means of}} control and disinfestation. This report is a review of the use and experience of different non-chemical methods. Some new methods which are being developed are microwaves, gamma radiation and ionization. Old methods like the use of steam for disinfection have been improved. They are more energy-efficient and less time-consuming. The possibility of using microwave energy to disinfest growing substrate, both soil and artificial material, is being researched. It is a low-energy and less time-consuming method when it comes to sterilizing soil. Satisfactory results have been documented. The technology has yet to be developed to fit the needs of <b>commercial</b> <b>horticulture.</b> When artificial substrate, rockwool, was treated in a microwave oven it resulted in an unequal distribution of heat in the rockwool and there was a limited temperature range in moistened rockwool. Rockwoll treated with RF-waves was however sufficiently disinfected. The use of steam for sterilizing soil is a well-known method. A new system with negative pressure is beeing developed. This system is more efficient than drain-steaming and steam applied under a plastic cover. Recycled rockwool is satisfactorily sterilized in containers heated by steam in many countries including Holland. The advantage of preventing problems by maintaining highly hygienic standards must not be underestimated. Different methods of cleaning the equipment are available, e. g. steam chambers for cleaning equipment, pot trays, recycled pots etc as well as hot water baths for disinfection of pot trays. Continuous cleaning of greenhouse buildings, coverings and fixtures with high-pressure and hot water is another way to forestall problems. Even the tables should be cleaned with high-pressure when possible. Recirculated drain water and nutrients are a main source of infection. There are different methods to sterilizing the solution, e. g. UV-light, ultra filtration, heating or biological filters...|$|E
