5|$|In {{communal}} defence, prey groups actively {{defend themselves}} by grouping together, and sometimes by attacking or mobbing a predator, rather than allowing {{themselves to be}} passive victims of predation. Mobbing is the harassing of a predator by many prey animals. Mobbing is usually done to protect the young in social colonies. For example, red <b>colobus</b> monkeys exhibit mobbing when threatened by chimpanzees, a common predator. The male red <b>colobus</b> monkeys group together and place themselves between predators and the group's females and juveniles. The males jump together and actively bite the chimpanzees. Fieldfares are birds which may nest either solitarily or in colonies. Within colonies, fieldfares mob and defecate on approaching predators, shown experimentally to reduce predation levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{diversity of}} large mammals {{is found in}} the three National Parks, which are designated conservation areas. Akagera contains typical savanna animals such as giraffes and elephants, while Volcanoes is home to an estimated one-third of the worldwide mountain gorilla population. Nyungwe Forest boasts thirteen primate species including chimpanzees and Ruwenzori <b>colobus</b> arboreal monkeys; the Ruwenzori <b>colobus</b> move in groups of up to 400 individuals, the largest troop size of any primate in Africa. Rwanda's population of lions was destroyed {{in the aftermath of the}} genocide of 1994, as national parks were turned into camps for displaced people and remaining animals were poisoned by cattle herders. In June 2015, two South African parks donated seven lions to Akagera National Park, reestablishing a lion population in Rwanda. The lions were held initially in a fenced off area of the park, and then collared and released into the wild a month later.|$|E
5|$|The {{forests of}} Cameroon contain {{some of the}} highest {{population}} density of forest elephants of any nation, and Nki is no different, with an elephant density of roughly 2.5 per square kilometer for Boumba Bek and Nki combined. The population has been steadily rising, from 1,547 in 1998 to 3,000 in 2006. Gorillas are also reported to abundant; there are an estimated 6,000 adults in Nki. The park is also home to diurnal primates, such as the threatened crested monkey, De Brazza monkey, and the black <b>colobus,</b> who reportedly only live east of the Dja River.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's {{service sector}} {{suffered}} during the late-2000s recession as bank lending, foreign aid projects and investment were reduced. The sector rebounded in 2010, becoming the country's largest sector by economic output and contributing 43.6% of the country's GDP. Key tertiary contributors include banking and finance, wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transport, storage, communication, insurance, real estate, business services and public administration including education and health. Tourism {{is one of}} the fastest-growing economic resources and became the country's leading foreign exchange earner in 2007. In spite of the genocide's legacy, the country is increasingly perceived internationally as a safe destination. The number of tourist arrivals in 2013 was 864,000 people, up from 504,000 in 2010. Revenue from tourism was US$303million in 2014, up from just US$62million in 2000. The largest contributor to this revenue was mountain gorilla tracking, in the Volcanoes National Park; Rwanda is one of only two countries in which mountain gorillas can be visited safely; the gorillas attract thousands of visitors per year, who are prepared to pay high prices for permits. Other attractions include Nyungwe Forest, home to chimpanzees, Ruwenzori <b>colobus</b> and other primates, the resorts of Lake Kivu, and Akagera, a small savanna reserve in the east of the country.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the peaceful and affectionate behaviours she observed, Goodall also found an aggressive side of chimpanzee nature at Gombe Stream. She discovered that chimps will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates such as <b>colobus</b> monkeys. Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a <b>colobus</b> monkey high in a tree, block all possible exits, then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the <b>colobus.</b> The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing {{with other members of}} the troop in response to begging behaviours. The chimps at Gombe kill and eat as much as one-third of the <b>colobus</b> population in the park each year. This alone was a major scientific find which challenged previous conceptions of chimpanzee diet and behaviour.|$|E
25|$|At least eleven {{species of}} diurnal {{primates}} {{have been observed}} in the Maringa-Lopori-Wamba Landscape. The Dryas monkey (Cercopithecus dryas) is endemic to the basins of the Maringa and the Lopori, and only two examples of the species are known. The bonobo (Pan paniscus), Thollon's red <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus tholloni), the golden-bellied mangabey (Cercocebus chrysogaster), and the black mangabey (Lophocebus aterrimus) are found here. Allen's swamp monkey (Allenopithecus nigroviridis) is endemic to the flooded or floodplain forests of the Central Basin, and the Angolan <b>colobus</b> (<b>Colobus</b> angolensis) is known only in the Central Basin, the northeast of the Congo, and the Africa Great Lakes region.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013, the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium named a {{black-and-white}} <b>colobus</b> after Sheldon.|$|E
25|$|Chimpanzees often eat {{the marrow}} of long bones of <b>colobus</b> monkeys {{with the help}} of small sticks, after opening the ends of the bones with their teeth. A {{juvenile}} female was observed to eat small parts of the brain of an intact skull that she could not break open by inserting a small stick through the foramen magnum. On another occasion, an adult female used three sticks to clean the orbits of a <b>colobus</b> monkey skull after she had just eaten the eyes.|$|E
25|$|There are {{at least}} 75 mammal species, {{including}} the African buffalo, the endangered African forest elephants, common chimpanzee, Preuss's red <b>colobus</b> and Sclater's guenon and the highly endangered drill.|$|E
25|$|Other mammals of BMNP {{include the}} endemic Menelik’s bushbuck, Bohor reedbuck, klipspringer, grey duiker, warthog, African golden wolf, spotted hyena, serval, <b>colobus</b> monkey, lion, leopard, and African wild dog.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergent}} layer {{contains a}} small number of very large trees, called emergents, which grow above the general canopy, reaching heights of 45–55m, although on occasion a few species will grow to 70–80m tall. Some examples of emergents include: Balizia elegans, Dipteryx panamensis, Hieronyma alchorneoides, Hymenolobium mesoamericanum, Lecythis ampla and Terminalia oblonga. These trees {{need to be able to}} withstand the hot temperatures and strong winds that occur above the canopy in some areas. Several unique faunal species inhabit this layer such as the crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus coronatus), the king <b>colobus</b> (<b>Colobus</b> polykomos), and the large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus).|$|E
25|$|<b>Colobus</b> monkeys live in {{the area}} in front of the lions. From East Africa, they move by leaping from tree to tree and can be seen in action in their lively exhibit.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the zoo {{brought in}} a troop of guinea baboons, the largest {{alligator}} outside of Florida, moved their flamingos to another pond, and altered the old tiger exhibit to hold a rock hyrax {{and a group of}} <b>colobus</b> monkeys.|$|E
25|$|This exhibit {{was opened}} in 1995 and {{features}} naturalistic, outdoor exhibit areas for western lowland gorillas, Sumatran orangutans and siamang gibbons. Other {{animals in the}} area are lion-tailed macaques, Mona monkeys, Sulawesi macaques, eastern black-and-white <b>colobus,</b> and savanna baboons.|$|E
25|$|The celebrated {{animals in}} the park are mostly primates, {{including}} chimpanzee, beach comber olive baboon, red-tailed monkey, and red <b>colobus</b> monkey. The park {{is the site of}} Jane Goodall's ongoing study of chimpanzee behaviour, which started in 1960. The study has reported 150 individuals who are familiar with humans.|$|E
25|$|Mammal species {{abound in}} this remote and not easily {{accessible}} park and consist of indigenous species of hippos, vervet monkeys, genets and mongooses, which coexist with introduced species of chimpanzee, black-and-white <b>colobus,</b> elephant and giraffe, bushbucks, shaggy-coated aquatic sitatunga. Fish eagles are seen near {{the bay and}} so also crocodiles.|$|E
25|$|The Tanzanian Department of Commercial Crops and Forestry has {{the task}} of forest {{conservation}} while marine parks are {{under the control of}} the Department of Fisheries and Marine Resources. A protected area network has also been established recently which is in the process of expansion. Conservation efforts are on to preserve red <b>colobus</b> and the Aders' duiker (presently unprotected in farmlands).|$|E
25|$|Rwanda {{is one of}} {{only two}} {{countries}} in which mountain gorillas can be visited safely; gorilla tracking, in the Volcanoes National Park, attracts thousands of visitors per year, who are prepared to pay high prices for permits. Other attractions include Nyungwe Forest, home to chimpanzees, Ruwenzori <b>colobus</b> and other primates, the resorts of Lake Kivu, and Akagera, a small savanna reserve in the east of the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate in}} this sea coast fronted park {{is hot and}} humid. Marine and {{mainland}} fauna reported in the park are of 30 species of large mammals, reptiles and birds; elephants, black and white <b>colobus</b> monkeys and Roosevelt sable antelope {{are some of the}} terrestrial species, while the marine or coastal species noted are many species of fish, green turtles which breed on the beaches, dolphins (pomboo) and humpback whales (nyangumi).|$|E
25|$|The {{thumb is}} not opposable in all primates— some primates, {{such as the}} spider monkey and <b>colobus,</b> are {{virtually}} thumbless. The spider monkey compensates for this by using the hairless part of its long, prehensile tail for grabbing objects. In apes and Old World monkeys, the thumbs can be rotated around its axis, but the extensive area of contact between the pulps of the {{thumb and index finger}} is a human characteristic.|$|E
25|$|The western lowland gorilla, chimpanzee, black <b>colobus,</b> {{mandrill}} {{and golden}} potto {{have all been}} listed on the IUCN Red List. The riparian areas of the Minkébé forest provide for creatures who require a water habitat, including the dwarf crocodile, spotted-necked otter, crested mangabey, sitatunga, and water chevrotain. The swampy areas interspersed with vegetation also includes habitat for parrots and python. The park contains some animals which are rare in Gabon including the bongo and the giant forest hog.|$|E
25|$|Female {{resistance}} {{has rarely}} {{been found to be}} effective. Male mammals and birds are usually larger than females, and the sheer size and strength difference makes this very difficult. However, it has been observed in some species, such as squirrel monkeys, patas monkeys, vervets, and captive chimpanzees, that females can “gang up” on males when they are being aggressive. They will even try to protect a female in distress. Females have even been observed to kill immigrant males in wild red <b>colobus</b> monkeys.|$|E
25|$|Formerly {{known as}} Heart of Africa, {{these are two}} of the park's major exhibits. Visitors go down a trail which {{replicates}} habitats in Africa. The exhibit begins in African Woods with scrub animals - vultures, lesser kudu, and giant eland. It then progresses to forest (okapi, duikers, and wattled cranes). The path then leads to African Outpost, which features plains animals - bontebok, common warthogs, ground hornbills, and cheetahs - against a backdrop of the open-range East Africa exhibit. A central lagoon has lesser and greater flamingos, waterfowl, an island with <b>colobus</b> monkeys, and an interpretive research camp on a separate island.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} Life on Earth {{prompted}} the BBC {{to consider a}} follow-up, and five years later, The Living Planet was screened. This time, Attenborough built his series around the theme of ecology, the adaptations of living things to their environment. It was another critical and commercial success, generating huge international sales for the BBC. In 1990 The Trials of Life completed the original Life trilogy, looking at animal behaviour through the different stages of life. The series drew strong reactions from the viewing public for its sequences of killer whales hunting sea lions on a Patagonian beach and chimpanzees hunting and violently killing a <b>colobus</b> monkey.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide range}} of fauna can be found within the reserve. Four species of {{primates}} are found, the Eastern Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurtii), the golden monkey, the blue monkey, and the L'Hoest's monkey (also known as mountain monkey). Though not since 2002, a fifth species of primate, {{the black and white}} <b>colobus</b> has been reported having been seen. There are currently estimated to be 20 East African chimpanzees in the forest. This is a 54% increase in population size from the 13 chimps in 2008, when the GACP first started. This includes five infants. The average density of chimpanzee nests was found to be 1.473 per km2 by Dr. Plumptree. Other mammals include the red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), the black front duiker (Cephalophus nigrifrons), the southern tree hyrax (Dendrohyrax arboreus), the serval (Felis serval), and Felis aurata.|$|E
25|$|The faunal {{diversity}} of wild life in Tanzania in its {{national parks and}} game reserves is also dramatic. There are 310 mammal species (fourth largest in Africa); 960 species of birds (third place in Africa); and many amphibians and reptiles, which are stated to form the fourth largest population in Africa. The endangered fauna species are; the black rhino; Uluguru bushshrikes; hawksbill, green turtles, olive ridley turtle and leatherback turtles; red <b>colobus</b> monkeys; wild dogs; and Pemba flying foxes. However, Lonely Planet also mentions a figure of 430 species of four million animals, and 60,000 insect species, 100 species of snakes and 25 species of reptiles, 1000 species of birds. More details of fauna species {{as reported by the}} Museum of Zoology of the University of Michigan, Bucknell University, Avibase data profiles and BirdLife International data profiles are the following. In the East Usambara Mountains, the forests display many rare species, {{so much so that the}} fauna found here have been compared to the Galapagos Islands in terms of biological importance.|$|E
25|$|Douala Edéa Wildlife Reserve, a {{wildlife}} reserve in the Littoral Region of Cameroon, {{is located on}} either side of the mouth of the Sanaga River along the shores of the Bight of Biafra opposite the island of Bioko. The reserve was established in 1932. As of 2000, it covered 160,000 hectares (400,000 acres). Cameroon designated the reserve as {{a wildlife}} park for scientific purposes in 1971, Lake Tissongo, a lagoon connected to the south bank of the Sanaga river by a 5 kilometres (3.1mi) tidal channel, is included in the reserve. 80% of the reserve is covered by tropical lowland equatorial forest, and 15% by Atlantic mangrove forests. Fauna include forest elephants, primates (chimpanzees, monkey species such as black <b>colobus),</b> antelopes (sitatunga, blue duiker, etc.), West African manatees, sea turtles, dolphins, crocodiles, alligator, many fish species, terrestrial and water bird species. The red-capped mangabey was reported to be common in the reserve in 1972. The endangered red-eared nose-spotted guenon was reported in the Lombé part of the reserve in densities of 2-3 groups per square kilometers, but populations had dropped elsewhere due to hunting.|$|E
500|$|Nineteen {{editions of}} Celebrity Big Brother have been made, {{involving}} {{a total of}} 231 housemates. The programme has been the centre of controversies over the actions and inclusion {{of some of its}} housemates. For instance, viewer and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) complaints prompted Hertfordshire Police to remove a coat from the 2006 edition after Pete Burns claimed that it was made from gorilla fur and therefore against the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species agreement of 1975. However, after an analysis at the Natural History Museum, it was later discovered that the coat was made from the fur of <b>Colobus</b> monkeys. Fellow members of parliament criticised George Galloway's participation in the same series, stating that Galloway had missed important debates regarding his constituency, Bethnal Green and Bow, and rejecting claims that Galloway took part to raise political awareness amongst the British youth. The family of Stuart Lubbock, a man who died in Michael Barrymore's swimming pool, criticised the programme makers for paying the entertainer £150,000 to participate on the programme. The mental states of the contestants were called into question during the first series; psychologist Mark Griffiths highlighted behaviour displayed by Anthea Turner and Vanessa Feltz as examples of the negative effects of the programme. Germaine Greer voluntarily left the 2005 series after accusing the producers of using [...] "superior bullying" [...] tactics against contestants; commentators such as Graham Norton have argued that the housemates are not [...] "actual celebrities". During the 2009 series, 527 viewers complained to Ofcom, the majority concerned about Coolio's conduct towards female contestants, but it was decided that the broadcaster's code was not breached. Comments made by Heidi Fleiss also proved controversial during the final series to air on Channel 4 of the programme in 2010; she accused Ivana Trump of smuggling drugs onto the programme, a claim that Trump's spokesperson denied, and made comments about abortion that attracted criticism.|$|E
2500|$|Chimpanzees also {{engage in}} {{targeted}} hunting of lower-order primates, {{such as the}} red <b>colobus</b> and bush babies, and use the meat from these kills as a [...] "social tool" [...] within their community.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the southwestern}} {{part of the}} zoo, [...] "Congo Gorilla Forest" [...] is a [...] {{rainforest}} {{that is home to}} the 20 or so western lowland gorillas in the zoo. Angolan <b>colobus</b> monkeys, guenon, marmosets and mandrills also call this area home. Visitors walk through the area and can also view it from treetop lookouts.|$|E
2500|$|The forest {{elephant}} {{is particularly}} important {{to the park and}} is believed by the WWF to contain one of the largest populations in Africa. The lesser forest in the park is inhabited by elephants, gorillas, and various small carnivores, porcupines, squirrels, african golden cats, leopards, giant pangolins, duikers and red river hog. The primary forest is inhabited by creatures such as mandrill, black <b>colobus</b> and chimpanzee.|$|E
2500|$|The steep western {{edges of}} the {{hillside}} are sparsely inhabited by wildlife compared to the forested gentle slopes to the east, which are home to [...] {{a wide variety of}} wildlife. [...] There are multitudes of elephant, buffalo, giant forest hog as well as the endangered black rhino. A variety of cats including leopards and the rare African golden cat. Other threatened species including the Jackson mongoose, the black and white <b>colobus</b> monkey and Sykes' monkey are plentiful, as are waterbuck, reedbuck, duikers, serval cats and bushbuck.|$|E
2500|$|Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park (JCBNP) is {{the only}} {{national}} park in Zanzibar, covering an area of , occupying the largest near-natural forest area on Zanzibar." [...] It is in the island of Unguja. Habitats within the park and associated protected lands include groundwater forests, coastal forests, and grassland, with mangroves and salt marsh on the coast. The fa species found here are the Zanzibar red <b>colobus</b> (Piliocolobus kirkii), an endangered species (in the IUCN List) endemic monkey and the Aders's duiker; groups of the <b>colobus</b> monkeys are seen close to the park. Wading birds are recorded in the marshy areas along with seaweed. The coral rag in the park is the earliest settlement, which was exploited for agricultural development due to population pressure. However, {{with help from the}} Government of Australia and CARE Tanzania, Government of Zanzibar established the Jozani Chwaka Bay Conservation Project, in 1995. Zanzibar’s first national park’s maintenance is partly met from the revenue generated from entry fee charged on visitors to the park. This fee is also shared with the Jozani Conservation Society used to construct and operate schools and health clinics for local villages. The park has created many trails through the forest to watch birds and also an elevated board-walk to see the mangrove forest.|$|E
2500|$|Primate Panorama spreads over [...] and {{primarily}} houses apes {{and other}} larger primates. Tree-dwelling apes and monkeys live in open-air wire mesh tents that soar four stories high and cover {{more than an}} acre of ground. Inside these tents, primates like <b>colobus</b> monkeys and red-capped mangabeys can play and climb on twisting vines. Western lowland gorillas roam freely, climbing ropes and taking afternoon hammock naps {{in one of the}} largest gorilla habitats in the world. Orangutans have their own outdoor habitat where they can climb trees and swing in hammocks.|$|E
2500|$|Arusha National Park {{is spread}} over {{an area of}} [...] It is within the riverine, lacustrine, and palustrine wetland ecosystem. It {{encompasses}} the montane forests and alpine deserts of Mount Meru, Africa's fifth highest mountain at [...] The park also has marshy areas, rolling grassy hills, and wooded savannah. The Ngurdoto Crater, the Momela Lakes, {{and one of the}} sources of the Pangani River are within the park. Wild animals and birds reported in the park include elephant (uncommon), leopard, waterbuck, spotted hyena, giraffe, blue monkey, <b>colobus</b> monkey, turaco, trogon, African buffalo, warthog, klipspringer, and red-hot poker. Water birds are also concentrated in large numbers in the lake areas, particularly flamingos. The park is near the city of Arusha, and the Kilimanjaro International Airport is [...] away.|$|E
2500|$|Opened in 1991, the Africa Rainforest exhibit covers [...] and {{was built}} {{at a cost}} of $4.3 million. In {{addition}} to animals, the exhibit includes artwork and the Kongo Ranger Station, a mock up of a safari expedition. Animals in the exhibit include Rodriguez fruit bats, straw-colored fruit bats, Egyptian fruit bats, <b>colobus</b> monkeys, Allen's swamp monkey, hadada ibis, white-faced whistling ducks, slender-snouted crocodile, Nile monitor lizard, lungfish, cichlids, lesser flamingos, geckos, chameleons, African crested porcupines, African clawed frogs, and hooded vultures. The rainforest includes four main areas: the Bamba Du Jon Swamp, which houses the lungfish, cichlids, frogs and reptiles; the rainforest aviary, which houses the birds; the monkey habitat which houses the monkeys and chameleon; and the bat habitat.|$|E
