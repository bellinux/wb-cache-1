40|$|We show a {{standard}} model where the optimal tax reform {{is to cut}} labor <b>taxes</b> and leave <b>capital</b> <b>taxes</b> very high in the short and medium run. Only in the very long run would <b>capital</b> <b>taxes</b> be zero. Our model is a version of Chamley??s, with heterogeneous agents, without lump sum transfers, an upper bound on <b>capital</b> <b>taxes,</b> and a focus on Pareto improving plans. For our calibration labor taxes should be low for the first ten to twenty years, while <b>capital</b> <b>taxes</b> should be at their maximum. This policy ensures that all agents benefit from the tax reform and that capital grows quickly after when the reform begins. Therefore, the long run optimal tax mix is the opposite from the short and medium run tax mix. The initial labor tax cut is financed by deficits that lead to a positive long run level of government debt, reversing the standard prediction that government accumulates savings in models with optimal <b>capital</b> <b>taxes.</b> If labor supply is somewhat elastic benefits from tax reform are high {{and they can be}} shifted entirely to capitalists or workers by varying the length of the transition. With inelastic labor supply there is an increasing part of the equilibrium frontier, this means that the scope for benefitting the workers is limited and the total benefits from reforming taxes are much lower. ...|$|R

Households are subject to skill shocks in both periods of the life-cycle. We allow for completely general skill processes including those with persistence in skill shocks. We demonstrate that <b>capital</b> <b>taxes</b> are optimal since they reduce moral hazard in social insurance in two distinct ways: i) <b>capital</b> <b>taxes</b> reduce labor supply distortions on second-period labor supply, since second-period labor supply and saving are substitutes, ii) <b>capital</b> <b>taxes</b> reduce distortions in first-period labor supply by allowing for {{a lower level of}} labor taxes, although this effect is partially off-set because first-period labor supply and saving are complements. <b>Capital</b> <b>taxes</b> will be more attractive for social insurance if a larger part of risk is realized in the first period of the life-cycle.
