5|$|Louis Braille {{survived the}} torment of the {{infection}} {{but by the}} age of five he was completely blind in both eyes. Due to his young age, Braille did not realize at first that he had lost his sight, and often asked why it was always dark. His parents made many efforts – quite uncommon for the era – to raise their youngest <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> normal fashion, and he prospered in their care. He learned to navigate the village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him, and he grew up seemingly at peace with his disability. Braille's bright and creative mind impressed the local teachers and priests, and he was accommodated with higher education.|$|E
5|$|Richard John Charles Tomlinson {{was born}} in Hamilton, New Zealand, {{and raised in the}} nearby town of Ngaruawahia. He was the middle <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> family of three brothers. His father came from a Lancashire farming family and he worked for the Ministry of Agriculture, and had met his wife whilst {{studying}} agriculture at Newcastle University. The family moved to Cumbria, England in 1968. The young Tomlinson won a scholarship for the independent Barnard Castle School in County Durham, where he was a contemporary of Rory Underwood and Rob Andrew, who went on to become England rugby internationals. He excelled at mathematics and physics, and won a scholarship to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Securely {{attached}} {{children are}} {{best able to}} explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in {{how to cope with}} the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment {{can be seen as the}} most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E

His mother {{died when he was}} seven years old. He attended a Dutch school but had no interest in academic studies. His involvement with music started when he was introduced to the Solfa music system by a teacher. A primary-school classmate subsequently taught him how to make and play a flute, and in middle school, he learned to play the guitar and drums from fellow students and the keroncong group he was involved in.|$|E
5|$|The tomb monument's design {{included}} {{figures of}} the three Virtues in niches, Cossa's family arms, a gilded bronze recumbent effigy laid out above an inscription-bearing sarcophagus supported on corbel brackets, and above it a Madonna and <b>Child</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> half-lunette, with a canopy over all. At {{the time of its}} completion, the monument was the tallest sculpture in Florence, and one of very few tombs within the Baptistry or the neighboring Duomo. The tomb monument was the first of several collaborations between Donatello and Michelozzo, and the attribution of its various elements to each of them has been debated by art historians, as have the interpretations of its design and iconography.|$|E

5|$|Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Berry was {{the fourth}} <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> family of six. He {{grew up in the}} north St. Louis {{neighborhood}} known as the Ville, an area where many middle-class people lived. His father, Henry William Berry (1895–1987), was a contractor and deacon of a nearby Baptist church; his mother, Martha Bell (Banks) (1894–1980), was a certified public school principal. Berry's upbringing allowed him to pursue his interest in music from an early age. He gave his first public performance in 1941 while still a student at Sumner High School; he was still a student there in 1944, when he was arrested for armed robbery after robbing three shops in Kansas City, Missouri, and then stealing a car at gunpoint with some friends. Berry's account in his autobiography is that his car broke down and he flagged down a passing car and stole it at gunpoint with a nonfunctional pistol. He was convicted and sent to the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men at Algoa, near Jefferson City, Missouri, where he formed a singing quartet and did some boxing. The singing group became competent enough that the authorities allowed it to perform outside the detention facility. Berry was released from the reformatory on his 21st birthday in 1947.|$|E

5|$|In the South Indian {{kingdom of}} Cholapuram Paalayam {{in the year}} 1771, Raja Mokkaiyappar and his queen, Rajamatha Bhavani Ammaiyar are desperate for a child, as all their {{previous}} twenty-two children have died at birth. Unknown to them, Bhavani's brother, Sangilimayan, {{who is also the}} Rajaguru (High priest), is {{responsible for the death of}} their children. Sangilimayan is shocked to see that his sister has given birth to twins. Before informing the king about the birth, he calls the palace astrologer, Chinnavadayaan, who predicts that the elder twin will be incapable of making decisions on his own while the younger one will be smarter. Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor, Kailasakaruppan, to kill the younger one, but Chinnavadayaan tells Sangilimayan that his actions would not be good for the kingdom. Instead, Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor to abandon the <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nearby river. The elder child is named Pulikecei XXIII.

5|$|Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) {{is a small}} {{oil panel}} by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably {{executed}} between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips {{the hem of her}} red dress in a manner that recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch {{at the rear of the}} nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's ethereal presence.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, a {{masquerade}} party ensues in {{the opera}} house. At the party, Christine wears her new engagement ring from Raoul. The event is interrupted once {{again by the}} Phantom, who is dressed as Red Death. The Phantom brings his own composition, Don Juan Triumphant, and orders the managers to stage the opera. Raoul exits the room and Christine approaches the Phantom. At {{the sight of the}} engagement ring, the Phantom rips it from Christine and disappears into a trap on the floor. Raoul tries to follow him but is stopped by Madame Giry, who privately tells him the story of the Phantom's past. When she was a little girl, she went to a freak circus where they featured a deformed <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cage. The child was beaten while everyone watched and laughed. The ringmaster then removed a burlap sack covering the child's face, revealing his deformity. Only the young Madame Giry pitied him. She was the last to leave and saw the child strangle the ringmaster with a rope. Chased by the police, Madame Giry helped him escape and found shelter for him beneath the opera house, where she has hidden him from the world ever since.|$|E
