50|$|<b>Clorgiline</b> (INN), or clorgyline (BAN), is a {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI) structurally related to pargyline which {{is described as}} an antidepressant. Specifically, it is an irreversible and selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). <b>Clorgiline</b> was never marketed, but it has found use in scientific research. In addition to its actions as an MAOI, <b>clorgiline</b> {{has been found to}} bind with high affinity to the σ1 receptor (Ki = 3.2 nM) and with very high affinity to the I2 imidazoline receptor (an allosteric site on the monoamine oxidase enzyme) (Ki = 40 pM).|$|E

50|$|Most {{antidepressants}} suppress REM sleep, {{in parallel}} with their alleviation of depressive symptoms (although suppression of REM sleep is not required for antidepressant effects). This includes TCAs (e.g., amitriptyline, nortriptyline), TeCAs (e.g., mianserin, maprotiline), MAOIs (e.g., <b>clorgiline,</b> pargyline), and SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine, zimelidine, indalpine). Trimipramine is unique {{in that it is}} an exception and produces antidepressant effects without compromising or otherwise affecting REM sleep. Even long-term treatment with trimipramine for up to 2 years has not been found to suppress REM sleep. In addition, trimipramine has been found to decrease nocturnal cortisol levels to normal and to normalize cortisol response in depressed patients; hence, it normalizes the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, whereas imipramine and other antidepressants tend to increase nocturnal cortisol secretion.|$|E
5000|$|Amine oxidases are {{a family}} of enzymes that {{catalyze}} the oxidation of various endogenous amines, including histamine or dopamine. VAP-1 constitutes the copper dependent class of amine oxidases, such as lysyl oxidase or lysine demethylase, {{and is one of}} the four known in humans. The other class is flavin dependent such as monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B. VAP-1, in particular, catalyzes the oxidative conversion of primary amines (methylamine and aminoacetone) to aldehydes (formaldehyde and methylglyoxal) ammonium and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of copper and quinone cofactor. VAP-1 is primarily localized on the cell surface on the adipocyte plasma membrane. However, circulating VAP-1 has been shown to be the main source of SSAO in human serum. Serum VAP-1 originates from many tissues. VAP-1 has adhesive properties, functional monoamine oxidase activity, and possibly plays a role in glucose handling, leukocyte trafficking, and migration during inflammation. [...] This rise in metabolic products contributes to generating advanced glycation end-products and oxidative stress along with the monoamine detoxification in the organism. Like monoamine oxidase (MAO), VAP-1 can deaminate short-chain primary amines, but SSAO enzymes, including VAP-1, can tolerate several selective flavin-dependent MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitors like <b>clorgiline,</b> pargyline, and deprenyl, but are still sensitive to semicarbazide and other hydrazines, hydroxylamine and propargylamine. VAP-1 is found in the smooth muscle of blood vessels and various other tissues, and can mostly be found in two forms: tissue-bound and soluble isoforms. The tissue-bound SSAO is primarily located in the leukocytes, adipocytes, and the endothelium of highly vascularized tissues, including the kidney, liver, and gonads. Thus, this form participates in cellular differentiation, deposition of the ECM (extracellular matrix) in smooth muscle cells, lipid trafficking in adipocytes and control of muscular tone, by mechanisms that are not completely understood. The soluble form, which is commonly known as VAP-1, is a proinflammatory protein derived from shedding of the transmembrane protein. It is highly expressed on the endothelium of the lung and trachea, and absent from leukocytes and epithelial cells. It moderates leukocyte recruitment, is both an adhesion molecule and a primary amine oxidase, and plays a role in clinical disease.|$|E
40|$|Older mice {{are much}} more {{susceptible}} to the dopamine-depleting actions of 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydro-pyridine (MPTP), an effect that has been correlated with age-related increases in {{the central nervous system}} activity of the enzyme responsible for its bioactivation, monoamine oxidase type B (MAO B). To characterize the involvement of MAO B further in the age-related effects of MPTP, a neurotoxic analog of MPTP, 1 -methyl- 4 -(2 ’-methylphenyl) -l, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyri-dine (2 ’CH 3 -MPTP), was used. This drug produced much larger depletions of striatal dopamine in 1 0 -month-old mice than in 2 -month-old animals, which indicated that the effects of 2 ’CH 3 -MPTP, like those of MPTP, are age related. Different from MPTP, however, neither the inhibition of MAO B (selegiline) nor MAO A (<b>clorgiline)</b> blocked the dopamine-depleting effects of 2 ’CH 3 -MPTP; rather, the simultaneous inhibition of both form...|$|E
