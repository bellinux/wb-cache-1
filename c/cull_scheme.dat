This paper describes {{the current situation}} of animal tuberculosis in Portugal, reviewing the accomplishments and constraints of the 2001 – 2009 period. Notwithstanding the substantial progress achieved {{with the implementation of}} a comprehensive test and <b>cull</b> <b>scheme,</b> notification, postmortem inspection and surveillance at slaughterhouses, herd and animal prevalence have unexpectedly increased in 2009. In parallel, the recent awareness of tuberculosis in local free-ranging wildlife species causes concern regarding the final steps towards eradication, demanding new approaches to the existing disease control policies. 1. The National Policy on Bovine Tuberculosis Although herd prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Portugal (0. 20 in 2010) remains markedly below the values of other European countries, it is presently the fourth cause for rejection of cattle meat [1]. Apart from being an economically detrimental disease affecting the productivity and international trade of livestock [2], tuberculosis (TB) may potentially have a severe impact on protected and/o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Paratuberculosis {{vaccination}} {{has been}} in use in some regions for many decades, but results have not been widely spread. A new Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) killed vaccine was studied in relationship with its effects on fecal shedding and milk production in four farms while other two were kept as controls submitted to a test and <b>cull</b> <b>scheme.</b> Findings Fecal detection (n = 1829) and milking records (n = 2413) have been analyzed after two (5 herds) and four (1 herd) years {{of the beginning of}} the intervention. Shedder prevalence was reduced by 100 % in three of the four vaccinated farms, 68 % in the total of vaccinated animals and 46 % in the two control farms. Total amount of MAP shed was reduced 77 % in the vaccinated farms and 94 % in the control farms. Overall milk production increased up to 3. 9 % after vaccination, while {{there was no significant difference}} in production after intervention in the non-vaccinated farms. Conclusion MAP shedding reduction can be quickly accomplished both by vaccination and by testing and culling. However, vaccination appears to be a less expensive and more sustainable strategy since it required one single intervention and was also associated with an increase in milk production. </p...|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} {{to the deaths of}} 7 swimmers attacked by sharks between 2010 and 2013, the government of Western Australia implemented a shark <b>culling</b> <b>scheme</b> in 2014 - a policy which generated considerable controversy in WA. Professor Meeuwig made a submission opposing the scheme to the State Environmental Protection Agency backed by 300 of the world's leading marine scientists. Meeuwig has analysed the data from a similar scheme in Queensland and found no statistical evidence that it has proved effective in reducing deaths from shark attacks.|$|R
40|$|A {{competitive}} nzyme immunoassay {{was developed}} to detect antibodies to a glycoprotein (gI) of Aujeszky's disease virus. Infected cell monolayers were used as antigen and a monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope of gI as indicator antibody. It was demonstrated that pigs vaccinated with the Bartha, BUK or NIA- 4 strains did not produce antibody to the epitope of gI, whereas all wild-type viruses tested did induce this antibody. The antibody to the gI epitope persisted for at least 15 weeks. The present est, which enables us to distinguish pigs vaccinated with certain attenuated strains from pigs infected with wild-type Aujeszky's disease virus, may be of great value in future combined vaccination-eradication programmes for Aujeszky's disease. In most countries where Aujeszky's disease is enzootic, vaccination of pigs against this herpesvirus infection is practised. Vaccination prevents neither infection or the establishment of latency of wild-type Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV). As a consequence, vaccination programmes alone will not lead to the elimination of ADV circulation. To achieve this goal, a serological testing and <b>culling</b> <b>scheme</b> should be followed. However, extensive vaccinatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{mobile phone}} {{is one of}} the most {{widespread}} devices with rendering capabilities. Those capabilities have been very limited because the resources on such devices are extremely scarce; small amounts of memory, little bandwidth, little chip area dedicated for special purposes, and limited power consumption. The small display resolutions present a further challenge; the angle subtended by a pixel is relatively large, and therefore reasonably high quality rendering is needed to generate high fidelity images. To increase the mobile rendering capabilities, we propose a new hardware architecture for rasterizing textured triangles. Our architecture focuses on saving memory bandwidth, since an external memory access typically {{is one of the}} most energy-consuming operations, and because mobile phones need to use as little power as possible. Therefore, our system includes three new key innovations: 1) an inexpensive multisampling scheme that gives relatively high quality at the same cost of previous inexpensive schemes, II) a texture minification system, including texture compression, which gives quality relatively close to trilinear mipmapping at the cost of 1. 33 32 -bit memory accesses on average, III) a scanline-based <b>culling</b> <b>scheme</b> that avoids a significant amount of z-buffer reads, and that only requires one context. Software simulations show that these three innovations together significantly reduce the memory bandwidth. and thus also the power consumption...|$|R

40|$|A. Che’ Amat et al. Animal {{tuberculosis}} (TB) {{caused by}} infection with Mycobacterium bovis and closely related {{members of the}} M. tuberculosis complex (MTC), is often reported in the Eurasian wild boar (. Sus scrofa). Tests detecting antibodies against MTC antigens are valuable tools for TB monitoring and control in suids. However, only limited knowledge exists on serology test performance in 2 - 6 month-old piglets. In this age-class, recent infections might cause lower antibody levels and lower test sensitivity. We examined 126 wild boar piglets from a TB-endemic site using 6 antibody detection tests {{in order to assess}} test performance. Bacterial culture (. n=. 53) yielded a M. bovis infection prevalence of 33. 9 %, while serum antibody prevalence estimated by different tests ranged from 19 % to 38 %, reaching sensitivities between 15. 4 % and 46. 2 % for plate ELISAs and between 61. 5 % and 69. 2 % for rapid immunochromatographic tests based on dual path platform (DPP) technology. The Cohen kappa coefficient of agreement between DPP WTB (Wildlife TB) assay and culture results was moderate (0. 45) and all other serological tests used had poor to fair agreements. This survey revealed the ability of several tests for detecting serum antibodies against the MTC antigens in 2 - 6 month-old naturally infected wild boar piglets. The best performance was demonstrated for DPP tests. The results confirmed our initial hypothesis of a lower sensitivity of serology for detecting M. bovis-infected piglets, as compared to older wild boar. Certain tests, notably the rapid animal-side tests, can contribute to TB control strategies by enabling the setup of test and <b>cull</b> <b>schemes</b> or improving pre-movement testing. However, sub-optimal test performance in piglets as compared to that in older wild boar should be taken into account.

40|$|Chair of Advisory Committee: Dr. Bruce H. McCormick A fast {{automated}} system for tracing neurons in parallel is described, adequate {{to support a}} quantitative analysis of neuron morphology. The system described here automates digitized neuron feature extraction and reconstruction, thereby replacing current largely manual techniques for tracing individual neurons. Serial sections of brain tissue are created by physical sectioning. Sections are pro-cessed during scanning to determine regions of interest (ROIs) and to quickly cull unneces-sary image data.

40|$|International audienceInteractive volume {{rendering}} {{methods such as}} texture-based slicing {{techniques and}} ray casting have been well developed in recent years. The rendering performance is generally restricted by the volume size, the fill-rate, and the texture fetch speed of the graphics hardware. For most 3 D data sets, {{a fraction of the}} volume is empty, which will reduce the rendering performance without specific optimization. In this paper, we present a simple kd-tree-based space partitioning scheme to efficiently remove the empty spaces from the volume data sets at the preprocessing stage. The splitting rule of the scheme is based on a simple yet effective cost function evaluated through a fast approximation of the bounding volume of the nonempty regions. The <b>scheme</b> <b>culls</b> a large number of empty voxels and encloses the remaining data with a small number of axis-aligned bounding boxes, which are then used for interactive rendering. The number of boxes is controlled by halting criteria. In addition to its simplicity, our scheme requires little preprocessing time and improves the rendering performance significantly...|$|R
