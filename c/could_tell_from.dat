500|$|In June 2003, Gravel gave {{a speech}} on direct {{democracy}} at a conference hosted by the American Free Press. The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left. I never saw the agenda for the day or listened to any of the other presentations." ...|$|E
500|$|Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York {{referred}} {{to being a}} [...] "must-see danceumentary." [...] Rothkopf described Jackson as [...] "obviously" [...] having been [...] "shooting for the moon right before his death" [...] {{based on what he}} <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> the [...] "stunning bits of concert spectacle" [...] of [...] "phalanxes of computer-generated dancers, tempo changes on a dime, a bombshell of a blond guitarist who plays Eddie Van Halen's [...] "Beat It" [...] solo flawlessly". Rothkopf stated that: [...] "But the true value of this raw rehearsal footage is its emphasis, less known, on MJ's laserlike attention to detail, as he works his band and troupe up to speed. A firm floor manager himself, he's often exposed — and probably wouldn't have approved of this film. (One on one, High School Musicals Kenny Ortega, meanwhile, treats him with kid gloves: [...] "I agree, Michael.") But to see him sweetly lose himself in [...] "Human Nature" [...] ("I like living this way...") is to feel a creature of the stage finally returned home, and possibly on the cusp of redemption." [...] Peter Paras, of E! Online felt that watching Jackson and his performances in a positive aspect is the [...] "genius and the sadness of the entire film." [...] He did note that Jackson's performance of [...] "Earth Song," [...] which consists of using Jackson's voiceover to emphasize his environmental concerns while a bulldozer threatens to eat him, was well-intentioned — because it brought attention to environmental concerns — but felt it was a little over the top. Paras felt the film showed an [...] "exacting and refreshingly funny side of Jackson to be revealed" [...] and [...] "had Jackson lived, we never would have seen those moments" [...] and felt the film was a proper way to [...] "finally say goodbye" [...] to Jackson.|$|E

2500|$|... "The {{irony is}} that it was during the time of {{publication}} that my father's relationship with Judah was most strained, and the point of conflict was over the content of the book. Judah attacked Meeting Soviet Man for being too sympathetic to the west, and too critical of the Soviet Union. I recall one particularly tense meeting at Judah's house. To lighten up the atmosphere he spent the first hour regaling us with colorful stories about the professional boxing bouts he attended in Melbourne's old Festival Hall. Then he and my father retired to another room to talk the issue out. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> the grim expressions as they emerged that there had been no resolution of their differences".|$|E
2500|$|Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead {{intended}} {{to record a}} version of [...] "Black Cat" [...] with Jackson, but was prohibited. Lemmy stated, [...] "I {{wanted to do a}} version of 'Black Cat' with her, but Sony wouldn't let me. You <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> the video that she was having a good time, that this loud rock music is what she really wanted to be doing. I love that fuckin' song.. Great fuckin' song that but the record company wouldn't let it be possible." [...] Lemmy later revealed Jackson as his most desired collaboration and planned to record a new version with her for his unreleased solo album Lemmy & Friends, saying [...] "I want to get Janet Jackson to do this great lost single called 'Black Cat'." [...] Dave Navarro recorded an additional opening and riffs throughout the version performed on Jackson's Rock Witchu Tour, appearing on screens during the rendition. Navarro previously collaborated with Jackson when remixing [...] "What'll I Do" [...] with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.|$|E
2500|$|Many people {{believed}} that {{the decision not to}} evacuate the ship was a grave error by Captain Locke, and that some or even all of the passengers could have been saved. [...] The Ministry of Marine reached a similar conclusion in 1919 after hearing the evidence from first hand witnesses. [...] Later, the courts ruled that right or wrong, the decision was within the reasonable range of judgment of the captain. [...] Captain Ledbetter of the Cedar stated that in his opinion, he never saw conditions that would have permitted evacuation of the ship, but he was careful, even almost 50 years later, to state that this was as far as he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> {{when he arrived at the}} reef, which was at 20:00 on the 24th. [...] As early as 10:20 on the 24th there were enough rescue vessels at the reef to have accommodated all of the people on the Sophia, and there would be 4 or 5 hours until the wind began to rise. [...] Also Sophia had 8 lifeboats built of steel, not wood, which would presumably have fared better on wave-washed rocks. [...] On the other hand, Captain Locke could not have known the weather would worsen, and there seem to have been signs that it would improve. [...] Historians Coates and Morrison speculate that the memory of the wreck of the Clallam, when everyone in the lifeboats died after a premature abandonment of the vessel, may have played a role in Locke's decision.|$|E

60|$|Walking {{along the}} Strand one evening last year towards Pall Mall, I was accosted near Charing Cross Station by a strange-looking, middle-aged {{man in a}} poor suit of clothes, who {{surprised}} and startled me by asking if I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> him <b>from</b> what inn the coach usually started for York.|$|R

60|$|He {{leaped from}} the sleigh and tied the horse. Then he {{climbed over the}} fence and began to run across the snow-covered fields.

60|$|They got up {{and walked}} to the studio. Philip <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> her manner whether Miss Price wished him to walk with her or {{preferred}} to walk alone.

60|$|I fell to {{guessing}} {{what her}} feelings were; {{for the life}} of me I <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> her face.

60|$|Upon her musings a small sound broke, so faint, so far, she <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> whence it came nor {{what its}} cause might be.

6000|$|... "You carry a very {{unnecessary}} burden then," [...] she said. But he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> at once <b>from</b> {{the altered}} tone of her voice, {{and from the}} light of her eye as he glanced into her face, that her anger about [...] "The Robes" [...] was appeased.|$|R
60|$|His {{reflections}} {{were broken}} by the abrupt opening of the door. Marlowe rushed in. Eustace peered anxiously out of his berth.

6000|$|... "Ay, sir, just as French as can be. I {{was one of}} {{the party}} as took them ashore and lodged them in jail; and there was no doubt about their all being French.

6000|$|I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> {{the tone}} of his voice that he had no will to play, but he dug the almost {{forgotten}} instrument out of a closet, strung it and tuned it, and that evening after dinner, when my father called out in familiar imperious fashion, [...] "Come, come! now for a tune," [...] David was prepared, reluctantly, to comply.|$|E
60|$|No; a dress-suit {{was what}} the hero wore in the movies; and the hero in the movies, when he wasn't a cowpuncher, was an ex-captain of the Yale {{football}} team, and had chambers and a valet.

5000|$|Also, [...] "In Houston, Dallas, and Galveston — all Negro piano players {{played that}} way.

60|$|And I {{told him}} {{he ought to be}} ashamed of himself going around working off his worthless, old, green {{watermelons}} on trusting purchasers who had to rely on him.

6000|$|... "Morrison!" [...] {{she whispered}} in an appalled tone. [...] "Morrison!" [...] Her head drooped.

6000|$|We {{stared at}} each other and at them, and then Goroko said {{that he would like to}} inspect the bodies to learn whether {{lightning}} killed at Kôr as it did elsewhere, also whether it had smitten them altogether or leapt from man to man.

60|$|About noon the cavalcade {{rode out}} of {{the mouth of a}} canon into a wide valley, {{surrounded}} by high, rounded foot-hills. Horses and cattle were grazing on the green levels.

60|$|We <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> {{minute to}} minute {{whether we were}} {{planning}} for a world of solid reality, or telling ourselves fairy tales about this prospect of life.

I couldn't even think of myself as five and thirty.|$|R
6000|$|What these {{deliberations}} tended to, {{those not}} of the council <b>could</b> not <b>tell,</b> but <b>from</b> {{the energy of the}} members, and an occasional burst of laughter from the group, it was obvious, as Jim Slagg remarked, that [...] "mischief o' some sort was in the wind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--it is important," [...] he {{said with}} a grim smile, and then he opened the letter.

Then, in that moment, it first {{occurred}} to her that he had a wonderful command of his features. All this, however, lasted but half a minute. Then he chucked the letter, lightly, in among the tea-cups, and coming to her took her closely in his arms and almost hurt her by the violence of his repeated kisses.|$|R
