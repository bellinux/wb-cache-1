40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} large real exchange rate movements on firm turnover and production scale, and the contribution of these decisions to productivity growth. Our theoretical model predicts that home <b>currency</b> <b>appreciations</b> cause firm closure and reduce surviving firms' exports while boosting domestic sales. The net effect on sales and productivity therefore depends on changes in domestic sales and exports. Taiwanese firm-level data are used to test these predictions.

40|$|Although real <b>currency</b> <b>appreciations</b> pose direct {{difficulties}} for exporters and import-competing firms {{as they will}} face more intense competition, {{is it possible that}} such competition spurs firms to improve productivity? To answer this question, the paper first constructs a theoretical model to show how the competitive pressures of <b>currency</b> <b>appreciations</b> induce firms to improve productivity by adopting new tech-nologies. In addition, the model predicts that during appreciations there will be a positive relation between market concentration and improvements in productivity for industries highly exposed to trade, because the benefits of productivity improvement will be bigger for firms with a larger market share. The paper then examines Cana-dian manufacturing data from 1997 to 2006, and finds evidence consistent with model predictions. I find that growth rates of labor productivity were on average higher during the Canadian dollar appreciation between 2002 and 2006, after controlling for industry characteristics. Within the group of highly traded Canadian industries, the more concentrated ones experienced larger growth in labor productivity...|$|R

50|$|The <b>currency’s</b> <b>appreciation</b> {{was crucial}} to keep {{inflation}} under control. Mainly, it assured the supply of cheap imported products to meet the domestic demand and forced domestic producers to sell at lower prices {{in order to maintain}} their market shares. This was especially important in the period immediately following the adoption of the new currency, when the sudden drop in inflation caused a surge in demand. The increased imports, therefore, were essential to avoid demand-side inflationary pressures that would undermine the stabilization plan.|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{import demand}} in East Asia. Estimating {{exchange}} rate elasticities for {{countries in the}} region is difficult because many imports are used to produce goods for re-export. An exchange rate appreciation that reduces East Asian exports will also reduce the demand for imported inputs that are used to produce exports. To correct for this bias this paper examines the imports of consumption goods, since these are intended primarily for the domestic market. Results from several specifications indicate that <b>currency</b> <b>appreciations</b> and increases in income in East Asian countries would significantly increase consumption imports. east asia demand; exchange rate elasticities; consumption goods...|$|R

40|$|We analyse {{exchange}} rate pass-through into import prices {{for a large}} group of 33 emerging and developed economies from 1980 Q 1 to 2010 Q 4. Our error correction models permit asymmetric pass-through for <b>currency</b> <b>appreciations</b> and depreciations over three horizons of interest: on impact, in the short run and in the long run. We find that depreciations are typically passed-through more strongly than appreciations in the long-run, suggesting that exporters may exert a degree of long-run pricing power. This asymmetry is stronger in economies which are more import dependent but is moderated by freedom to trade and a positive output gap. Given that this pass-through asymmetry is welfare-reducing for consumers in the destination market, a key macroeconomic implication is that import-dependent economies, in particular, can benefit from trade liberalisation...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{appreciation}} of the Swiss franc provoked opposition based on the conventional view that <b>currency</b> <b>appreciations</b> reduce domestic output. An alternative, supplyside view, however, is that an appreciating currency is evidence that policy changes have improved inflation, investment, productivity and output. This article reviews the two views, then shows that the Swiss evidence rejects the conventional hypothesis of a negative relationship between movements in a currency's value and output, based on tests {{of the existence of}} cointegrating relationships between measures of the exchange rate and various measures of output and productivity, as well as measures of nominal exports. Statistically significant long-run relationships are found that generally support the alternative view. Policies that boost investment, productivity and real income also raise the currency's value, so the latter rise has been a signal of enhanced prosperity instead of a cause of its demise. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} tax-based export promotion on exchange rates and patterns of trade. The threatened removal of Foreign Sales Corporations (FSCs) due to the 1997 European Union complaint before the World Trade Organization (WTO) is used to identify the adjustment of exchange rates to reduced after-tax margins for American exporters. The evidence indicates that days associated with significant developments in the European complaint are characterized by predicted changes {{in the value of}} the U. S. dollar. Additionally, foreign trading relationships with the United States appear to influence currency responses to the possibility of FSC repeal. Exchange rate movements on the date of the initial European complaint indicate that 10 percent greater net trade deficits with the United States are associated with <b>currency</b> <b>appreciations</b> of 0. 2 percent against the U. S. dollar. This evidence is consistent with a combination of trade-based exchange rate determination and important effects of U. S. export promotion policies. ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{literature}} suggests that economic exposure shouid be managed within the firm’s overall strategy regarding the choice of production iocation. In this paper, it is shown that this strategy is equivalent to exposed firms incorporating real options in their cost function, enabling these firms to eliminate relative cost increases due to domestic <b>currency</b> <b>appreciations.</b> The paper offers two strands of criticism against this approach: First, {{it shows that the}} exercise of these real options for hedging economie exposure does not correspond to the real exchange rate changes which create exposure. Second, in short-run periods, relocating production as a means of hedging is a negative Net Present Value ‘investment’. li is proposed that currency cali options should be used instead of real options. Setting the strike rate equal to the PPP exchange rate adjusted by the expected inflation rate differential captures reai exchange rate changes which cause economie exposure.

40|$|During {{the last}} few years, large {{holdings}} of foreign assets and liabilities along with an increasing relevance of the valuation effects—capital gains or losses—have characterized global financial integration. This paper presents an empirical assessment {{of the implications of}} stocks, flows and valuation adjustments in external crises, sovereign credit ratings and the long-run dynamics of real exchange rates (RER), in both industrial and developing economies. We find that foreign assets and liabilities are rather distinctive external holdings with different implications in the occurrence of an external crisis. Valuation adjustments have an impact on crises, although quantitatively not very large. Portfolio liabilities (particularly equity) increase the probability of current account reversals, while the likelihood of sudden stops increases with foreign direct investment assets. In the case of sovereign credit ratings, we find a noteworthy effect of the stock and flows of FDI liabilities on improvin sovereign ratings. Finally, as for the RER, gross assets and liabilities appear equally important, but components of external holdings have considerably different effects. While the cumulative current account is associated with real depreciation, the valuation effect is strongly linked with real <b>currency</b> <b>appreciations</b> in developing economies. ...|$|R
2500|$|The Eurozone is {{a special}} case where some members, principally Germany, enjoy a large current account surplus and so could accept or even benefit from <b>currency</b> <b>appreciation.</b> [...] Other {{countries}} though such as Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland have twin deficits and so {{to a large extent}} would benefit from a depreciation.

40|$|Relative price {{changes in}} Japanese and U. S. {{manufacturing}} {{are driven by}} two forces, productiviry growth which leads to secular changes in costs and exchange rate fluctuations which change relative prices between the two countries. In sectors where productivity growth is high, reductions in costs can neutralize exchange rate appreciations to keep prices competitive with those abroad, {{at least in the}} long run, But even in these sectors, exchange rate fluctuations are the dominant influence on relative competitiveness in the short run. Faced with swings in exchange rates, firms adopt defensive measures to defend their export markets. The paper presents estimates of "pricing to market" elasticities which suggest that firms lower their export prices in domestic currency relative to their domestic prices in order to limit the effects of <b>currency</b> <b>appreciations.</b> There is evidence that firms in both countries pursue such pricing strategies, but pricing to market is more extensive in Japan. In response to a appreciation of the yen, Japanese firms reduce their export prices in yen sharply so as to limit the pass-through of the appreciation into the dollar prices of their exports. ...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{theory of}} price {{formation}} {{tells us how}} {{the price of a}} particular asset will change based on the adjustment to its supply and demand. However, values of assets are also determined by other business fundamentals, company’s and world events, human psychology, and investors’ belief about the possible future profit. In recent history that lead to an increase of individual and institutional investors’ interest in allocating their resources in commodity markets. With a large inflow of capital commodities’ prices started to rise making them attractive components to effective investment portfolios. The presented paper addresses the issue of so called commodities ‘financialization’ process. It looks at the main factors standing behind commodities’ price movements and to what extent financial market participants contributed to commodities price volatility in recent years. Based on the data examined it distinguishes the involvement of both commercial and non-commercial traders in short and long term periods of time. As well as explaining the impact of growing investors’ interest in commodity markets it defines other market forces - like <b>currency</b> <b>appreciations</b> and emerging markets - as being part of increased volatility in raw and soft commodity markets. Along with market examination the paper focuses on possible future outcomes in attempts to regulate commodities derivatives markets and potential effects of those efforts...|$|R

50|$|Yet {{another factor}} {{determining}} import levels was the exchange rate. After {{the ending of}} the Bretton Woods System in 1971, the yen appreciated against the United States dollar and other <b>currencies.</b> The <b>appreciation</b> of the yen made imports less expensive to Japan, but it had a complex effect on total imports. Demand for raw material imports was not affected much by price changes (at least in the short run). Demand for manufactured goods, however, was more responsive to price changes. Much of the rapid increase in imports of manufactures after 1985, when the yen began to appreciate rapidly, can be attributed to this exchange-rate effect.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{literature}} addressing the effects of exchange rate movements on manufacturing firms, but little similar analysis concerning firms in the service sector. As the service sector is the largest component of the Canadian economy and services are becoming increasingly tradable, the implication of international economy on service sector firms is an important, yet rarely explored, research question. This paper addresses the question by analyzing the effects of industry specific real exchange rate movements on the profitability, survival and sales of Canadian service sector firms. Using rich firm-level data that covers the universe of incorporated firms in Canada and service trade data, our empirical results show that real appreciations of the Canadian dollar reduce firm probability of survival, sales and profitability while depreciations have the opposite effect (a separate abstract on firm-level data is attached). In addition, the negative effect of real <b>currency</b> <b>appreciations</b> on firm survival is less pronounced for more productive firms. Our findings suggest a significant exchange rate effect on service firms similar to that found for manufacturing firms in earlier studies by Baggs and Brander (2006) and Baggs, Beaulieu and Fung (2009). When comparing the economic magnitude of the exchange rate effects on service sector firms to the effects on manufacturing firms, we find that, when facing an identical movement {{of the value of}} the Canadian dollar from the highest to the lowest level, service sector firms experience smaller increase in profit and sales but larger increase in probability of survival as compared to manufacturing firms...|$|R
