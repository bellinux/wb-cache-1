50|$|<b>Comparable</b> <b>transactions</b> {{is one of}} the {{conventional}} methods to value a company for sale. The main approach of the method is to look at similar or <b>comparable</b> <b>transactions</b> where the acquisition target has a similar business model and similar client base to the company being evaluated. This approach is fundamentally different from that of DCF valuation method, which calculates intrinsic value.|$|R

50|$|The {{comparable}} uncontrolled price (CUP) {{method is}} a transactional method that determines the arm's-length price using the prices charged in <b>comparable</b> <b>transactions</b> between unrelated parties. In principle, the OECD and most countries that follow the OECD guidelines consider the CUP method {{to be the}} most direct method, provided that any differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions have no material effect on price or their effects can be estimated and corresponding price adjustments can be made. Adjustments may be appropriate where the controlled and uncontrolled transactions differ only in volume or terms; for example, an interest adjustment could be applied where the only difference is time for payment (e.g., 30 days vs. 60 days). For undifferentiated products such as commodities, price data for arm's-length transactions ("external comparables") between two or more other unrelated parties may be available. For other transactions, {{it may be possible to}} use <b>comparable</b> <b>transactions</b> ("internal comparables") between the controlled party and unrelated parties.|$|R

However, the real effects of high rates of inflation are not large: output, consumption, and investment slightly fall with higher inflation rates. In addition, the welfare cost of inflation is calculated for annual rates of inflation ranging from 0 % to 50 %.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose and discuss {{practical}} approaches on how to address risk and uncertainty within valuation reports, particularly when there is only insufficient <b>comparable</b> <b>transaction</b> evidence available. Design/methodology/approach – A four stage approach to property valuation is proposed that can be particularly useful if there is insufficient <b>comparable</b> <b>transaction</b> evidence available: Identifying, measuring and expressing risk by making use of property rating approaches. Transforming risk into risk premia for calculating the yield on a risk free basis by partially making use of models of risk and return usually applied in finance. Simulating risk premia (since there is great deal of uncertainty involved in determining these premia) by making use of a statistical method commonly referred to as Monte Carlo Simulation. Using the derived yield's probability distribution in combination with further probability distributions for other valuation input variables (e. g. market rent) to calculate a range of possible outcomes of Market Value as well as a number of statistical measures that can be indicative of the valuer's perceived uncertainty regarding the valuation assignment. Findings – The empirical part shows that due to data limitations determining idiosyncratic risk premia for property assets is not yet possible. This significantly hampers the development of robust yield pricing models and reinforces the need to create databases including information on both individual property returns and associated building characteristics. Practical implications – The paper postulates that there are few (if any) rational reasons for valuers not to use rating and simulation approaches as an indispensable element of the valuation process. Originality/value – A valuation approach that allows simultaneously addressing risk and uncertainty as well as sustainability issues within commercial property valuation practice is proposed. 34 page(s...|$|R

Most sets of rules prescribe methods for testing whether prices charged should be considered to meet this standard. Such rules generally involve comparison of related party transactions to similar transactions of unrelated parties (<b>comparable</b> prices or <b>transactions).</b> Various surrogates for such transactions may be allowed. Most guidelines allow the following methods for testing prices: <b>Comparable</b> uncontrolled <b>transaction</b> prices, resale prices based on comparable markups, cost plus a markup, and an enterprise profitability method.|$|R

40|$|In {{the western}} {{societies}} based on private ownership expropriation {{of private property}} for the public good has been enabled by legislation. Such legislation may have issued from the hindrance of developments required for the public good caused by the landowner, possibly in a monopolistic position, when refusing of a voluntary transfer of his land or claiming for an unrealistically high compensation. Another reason {{may also have been}} to ensure the efficiency of land acquisition. According to legislation the determination of just compensation is the principle rule for expropriation of property, i. e. paying such compensation that the landowner’s financial situation will remain the same despite the expropriation. In the Finnish condition this traditionally means a market price calculated from <b>comparable</b> real property <b>transactions.</b> This raises a few questions, which may even be of general interest: − How well does the statistical price determined according to <b>comparable</b> <b>transactions</b> compensate for the losses? − Will the compensation statutes, valuation methods and manners really lead to just compensation? − How just will it be if the expropriator gets the whole profit from a property, especially when expropriated by private quarters mainly for private purposes? The article is treating the situation mainly from the Finnish and Nordic tradition, but also aims at considering the future in a wider sweep. Only compensations to the owner are treated.

40|$|Industrial cache {{coherence}} protocol models often {{have too many}} reachable states, preventing full reachability analysis even for small model instances (number of processors, addresses, etc.). Several partial search debugging methods are, therefore, employed, including lossy state compression using hash compaction, and bounded model checking (BMC, or equivalently, depth-bounded search). We show that instead of a BMC <b>approach,</b> a bounded <b>transaction</b> <b>approach</b> is much more effective for debugging. This {{is because of the}} fact that the basic unit of activity in a {{cache coherence}} protocol is that of a transaction- e. g., a complete causal cycle of actions beginning with a node making a request for a line and obtaining the line. The reduced effectiveness of BMC mainly stems from the fact that by limiting only the search depth, it cannot be guaranteed that complete transactions get selected, or that the right kind maximal number of interacting transactions. Thus, instead of bounded model-checking, which explores all possible interleavings in BFS, we propose a bounded <b>transaction</b> model-checking <b>approach</b> for debugging cache coherence protocols, where the criterion is to allow a certain number of transactions chose...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Com.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2004. Many intra-firm {{transactions}} are non-market transactions and therefore lack a market determined price. A transfer price {{is the price}} assigned to such nonmarket intra-firm transfers. Transfer prices are especially important for multinational corporations, since a parent company typically has subsidiaries or branches in other countries and transfers are often made between the component parts of the multinational. As the world has become more internationally dependent, these transactions and the associated transfer prices have come under increased scrutiny. The fear often expressed by governments is that a multinational corporation may manipulate transfer prices in order to transfer profits {{from one country to}} another, and thereby affect various government policies. Most notably, transfer prices can affect the tax revenues of both the home and host country. A general international consensus is that the appropriate transfer price is the 'arm's length' price. This is the price that would be charged by two unrelated parties. However, {{it is often difficult to}} find such a <b>comparable</b> <b>transaction...</b>|$|R
