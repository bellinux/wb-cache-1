40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} use of a balloon {{catheter}} device with {{the use of}} a cervical vacuum cup device in performing hysterosalpingography (HSG). Design Prospective, randomized, single-blinded study. Setting Tertiary infertility center. Patient(s) Two hundred twenty-nine infertile women undergoing HSG. Intervention(s) Subjects were randomized to undergo HSG using a cervical vacuum cup (n = 115) or a balloon catheter (n = 114). Randomization was performed according to Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. Main Outcome Measure(s) The degree of pain experienced during and after the HSG, evaluated using a 100 -mm visual analogue scale. The length of the procedure, the fluoroscopic time, the volume of contrast used, the difficulty of performing HSG, and the percentage of complications were also evaluated. Result(s) Women in the cervical-cup group experienced more pain than those in the balloon catheter group during the contrast injection (median visual analogue scale pain scores, 13. 0 vs. 6. 5). The placement of the balloon catheter in comparison with the <b>cervical</b> <b>cup</b> was slightly easier to perform, although it required a somewhat longer time. The HSG using the <b>cervical</b> <b>cup</b> required less fluoroscopic time (median, 0. 6 vs. 0. 8 min). Conclusion(s) The balloon catheter appears to be better tolerated than the <b>cervical</b> <b>cup,</b> but the difference is minimal. The use of the <b>cervical</b> <b>cup</b> allows shortening of the patient radiation exposure...|$|E
30|$|The <b>cervical</b> <b>cup</b> withstands {{electric}} and sonar energy and delineates exactly {{the border between}} the vagina and cervix. It serves as a surgical platform. Crucial surgical steps, e.g. bicoagulation of uterine vessels and intrafascial detachment of ligaments and vagina, are all performed in direct contact with the fringe of the cup (Video 2). These cups have a special design to adapt to the anatomy of the anterior and posterior vaginal fornices (Fig.Â  1).|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: This review aims {{to provide}} a {{comprehensive}} overview of the literature and elucidate open questions for future clinical trials concerning diagnostics and treatment modalities for cervical cancer of unknown primary (CUP). Methods: A literature search for head and neck CUP was performed with focus on diagnostics and therapies as well as molecular markers. Results: High level evidence on CUP is limited. However, it seems that a consensus exists regarding the optimal diagnostic procedures. The correct implementation of biomarkers for patient stratification and treatment remains unclear. An even greater dispute dominates about the ideal treatment with publications ranging from sole surgery to surgery with postoperative bilateral radiotherapy with inclusion of the mucosa and concomitant chemotherapy. Conclusions: <b>Cervical</b> <b>CUP</b> represents a very heterogeneous malignant disease. On this account many aspects concerning treatment optimization remain unclear, despite {{a considerable number of}} publications in the past. Future research in form of prospective randomized trials is needed in order to better define patient stratification criteria and enable tailored treatment...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Since 1950, {{traditional}} Chinese medicine (TCM) cupping {{therapy has}} been applied as a formal modality in hospitals throughout China {{and elsewhere in the}} world. Based on a previous systematic literature review of clinical studies on cupping therapy, this study presents a thorough review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the therapeutic effect of cupping therapy. METHOD: Six databases were searched for articles published through 2010. RCTs on cupping therapy for various diseases were included. Studies on cupping therapy combined with other TCM treatments versus non-TCM therapies were excluded. RESULTS: 135 RCTs published from 1992 through 2010 were identified. The studies were generally of low methodological quality. Diseases for which cupping therapy was commonly applied were herpes zoster, facial paralysis (Bell palsy), cough and dyspnea, acne, lumbar disc herniation, and <b>cervical</b> spondylosis. Wet <b>cupping</b> was used in most trials, followed by retained cupping, moving cupping, and flash cupping. Meta-analysis showed cupping therapy combined with other TCM treatments was significantly superior to other treatments alone in increasing the number of cured patients with herpes zoster, facial paralysis, acne, and cervical spondylosis. No serious adverse effects were reported in the trials. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous RCTs on cupping therapy have been conducted and published during the past decades. This review showed that cupping has potential effect in the treatment of herpes zoster and other specific conditions. However, further rigorously designed trials on its use for other conditions are warranted...|$|R
