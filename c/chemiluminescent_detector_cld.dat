40|$|This work {{describes}} the calibration {{of a gas}} chromatograph equipped with a sulfur <b>chemiluminescent</b> <b>detector</b> with dual plasma (GC-SCD-DP) for analysis of sulfur-containing petroleum refinery gaseous streams. A packed column in an inert tube (Sulfinert) and an inlet system resistant to reactive sulfur compounds were used. The behavior of the calibration procedure over time depended on the sulfur compound: hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), carbonyl sulfide (COS), methanethiol (MeSH) and dimethylsulfide (DMS) gave constant responses, whereas SO 2 presented a systematic increase and dimethyldisulfide (DMDS) showed a systematic decrease of their response factors. In all cases, the response factors were lower than the ones found in the ASTM D 5504 - 08 method.

40|$|Satellite {{instruments}} {{such as the}} {{backscattered ultraviolet}} (BUV) apparatus, have been in operation {{for a number of}} years. One current difficulty is the validation of the ozone inferences obtained from the BUV measurements using independent instruments. For higher altitudes rocket instruments are necessary. Two instruments currently under development include a <b>chemiluminescent</b> <b>detector</b> described by Hilsenrath et al.

The present investigation is concerned with an analysis of the Rocoz system, the information content of the measurements, and the utility of the system for intercomparison with the BUV system. It is found that the sampling characteristics of the Rocoz and BUV systems exhibit some fundamental differences. However, their results can be related through knowledge of the relation between pressure and altitude. This is best obtained through the solution of the hypsometric equation using rocket temperature measurements...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Current diesel engine {{after-treatment}} systems, such as Selective Catalyst Reduction (SCR), use ammonia (NH 3) {{to reduce the}} Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) into Nitrogen (N 2) and water; however, if the reaction between ammonia and NOx unbalance this can lead either ammonia or NOx being released into the environment. Ammonia is classified as dangerous compound for the environment; therefore, accurate measurement of ammonia is essential. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) {{is one of the}} most common method used to measure raw emissions from engine exhaust pipes, due to its capability to measure multi-type emissions at the same time. However, not many FTIRs that can measure gas from engine exhaust, and most of them has different characteristics and specifications. These can affect the emission measurement from exhaust pipes and lead to uncertainties in meeting compliance demands. The work of this paper compares two FTIR that have different specifications. These FTIRs, have been compared under well controlled laboratory conditions. The concentration of ammonia and NOx from diesel engines has been measured under different engine load and speed. The ammonia readings from each FTIR are plotted into a graph and analysed, the results show that one of the FTIR produces a lower reading compare to the other FTIR. A Chemical Luminance <b>Detector</b> (<b>CLD)</b> was used to measure the NOx and then compared with both FTIRs. After analysed those dataset, the results clearly show the FTIR specification can affect the emission measurement from diesel engines exhaust...|$|R
40|$|The {{activity}} {{carried out}} during my PhD was principally {{addressed to the}} development of portable microfluidic analytical devices based on biospecific molecular recognition reactions and CL detection. In particular, the development of biosensors required the study of different materials and procedures for their construction, with particular attention {{to the development of}} suitable immobilization procedures, fluidic systems and the selection of the suitable detectors. Different methods were exploited, such as gene probe hybridization assay or immunoassay, based on different platform (functionalized glass slide or nitrocellulose membrane) trying to improve the simplicity of the assay procedure. Different CL detectors were also employed and compared with each other in the search for the best compromise between portability and sensitivity. The work was therefore aimed at miniaturization and simplification of analytical devices and the study involved all aspects of the system, from the analytical methodology to the type of detector, in order to combine high sensitivity with easiness-of-use and rapidity. The latest development involving the use of smartphone as <b>chemiluminescent</b> <b>detector</b> paves the way {{for a new generation of}} analytical devices in the clinical diagnostic field thanks to the ideal combination of sensibility a simplicity of the CL with the day-by-day increase in the performance of the new generation smartphone camera. Moreover, the connectivity and data processing offered by smartphones can be exploited to perform analysis directly at home with simple procedures.

40|$|Local and {{systemic}} inflammation {{can lead to}} progression of burn wounds, converting second- to third-degree wounds or extending the burn to adjacent areas. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} the skin is an important site of production of nitric oxide (NO), synthesized by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activation after injury. NO increases in burned wounds, but its formation in noninjured skin has not been investigated. We hypothesized that after severe burns, NO and cytotoxic peroxynitrite would increase in noninjured skin. We also tested the hypothesis that BBS- 2, a specific inhibitor of iNOS, would impair NO formation after burn. Thirteen female sheep were randomized into burn injury and smoke inhalation (n = 5, group 1), burn and smoke treated with BBS- 2 (n = 3, group 2), and sham (saline treatment, no injury) (n = 5, group 3). All the animals, including the sham-injury group, were mechanically ventilated for 48 h. Samples of nonburned skin and plasma were collected from each animal, and levels of NO and its metabolites were evaluated using a NO <b>chemiluminescent</b> <b>detector.</b> Nitrotyrosine and iNOS expression were determined in the skin by Immunoperoxidase staining, and scoring of masked slides (epidermis, hair follicles, vessels, glands, and stroma) was performed. Skin NO and metabolites significantly increased in the burn and smoke injury group, and this was inhibited by BBS- 2. Nitrotyrosine expression also increased significantly in the skin of burned animals. BBS- 2 prevented the increase of NOx but not the increase of nitrotyrosine expression in skin. Plasma levels of NO increased in burned animals when compared with sham, but this increase was not significant. The increase of NO and its metabolites after burn in noninjured skin is followed by a significant increase in peroxynitrite, a potent cytotoxic mediator...|$|R

40|$|N-nitrosodimethylamine is a high, {{carcinogenic}} manufacturing {{by-product of}} unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine {{a component of}} rocket fuel. Prior disposal practices resulted in the contamination of groundwater near certain military installations with both species. The current regulatory threshold promulgated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for NDMA in surface waters designated for drinking is 0. 7 ng NDMA/L (0. 7 pptr) L.

40|$|The {{input and}} loss of plant {{available}} nitrogen (N) from/to the atmosphere {{can be an important}} factor for the productivity of ecosystems and thus for its carbon and greenhouse gas exchange. We present a novel converter for the measurement of total reactive nitrogen (TRANC: Total Reactive Atmospheric Nitrogen Converter), which offers the opportunity to quantify the sum of all airborne reactive nitrogen (Nr) compounds in high time resolution. The basic concept of the TRANC is the full conversion of total Nr to nitrogen monoxide (NO) within two reaction steps. Initially, reduced N compounds are being oxidised, and oxidised N compounds are thermally converted to lower oxidation states. Particulate N is being sublimated and oxidised or reduced afterwards. In a second step, remaining higher N oxides or those originated in the first step are catalytically converted to NO with carbon monoxide used as reduction gas. The converter is combined with a fast response chemiluminescence <b>detector</b> (<b>CLD)</b> for NO analysis and its performance was tested for the most relevant gaseous and particulate Nr species under both laboratory and field conditions. Recovery rates during laboratory tests for NH 3 and NO 2 were found to be 95 and 99 %, respectively, and 97 % when the two gases were combined. In-field longterm stability over an 11 -month period was approved by a value of 91 % for NO 2 . Effective conversion was also found for ammonium and nitrate containing particles. The recovery rate of total ambient Nr was tested against the sum of individual measurements of NH 3 , HNO 3 , HONO, NH 4 +, NO 3 &minus;, and NOx using a combination of different well-established devices. The results show that the TRANC-CLD system precisely captures fluctuations in Nr concentrations and also matches the sum of all Nr compounds measured by the different single techniques. The TRANC features a specific design with very short distance between the sample air inlet and the place where the thermal and catalytic conversions to NO occur. This assures a short residence time of the sample air inside the instrument, and minimises wall sorption problems of water soluble compounds. The fast response time (half-value periods of 0. 30 s were found during concentration step changes) and high accuracy in capturing the dominant Nr species enables the converter to be used in an eddy covariance setup. Although a source attribution of specific Nr compounds is not possible, the TRANC is a new reliable tool for permanent measurements of the net Nr flux between ecosystem and atmosphere at a relatively low maintenance and reasonable cost level allowing for diurnal, seasonal and annual investigations...|$|R
40|$|With the {{constant}} {{growth of the}} World Wide Web {{and the number of}} documents in different languages accordingly, the need for reliable language detection tools has increased as well. Platforms such as Twitter with predominantly short texts are becoming important information resources, which additionally imposes the need for short texts language detection algorithms. In this paper, we show how incorporating personalized user-specific information into the language detection algorithm leads to an important improvement of detection results. To choose the best algorithm for language detection for short text messages, we investigate several machine learning approaches. These approaches include the use of the well-known classifiers such as SVM and logistic regression, a dictionary based approach, and a probabilistic model based on modified Kneser-Ney smoothing. Furthermore, the extension of the probabilistic model to include additional user-specific information such as evidence accumulation per user and user interface language is explored, with the goal of improving the classification performance.

40|$|Recently a new {{detection}} method, {{based upon}} aerosol charging (the charged aerosol detector (CAD)) {{has been introduced}} {{as an alternative to}} evaporative light-scattering <b>detector</b> (ELSD), <b>chemiluminescent</b> nitrogen <b>detector</b> and refractive index detector for detection of non-ultraviolet and weakly ultraviolet active compounds and for UV-absorbing compounds in the absence of standards. The content of this review article includes description of operation principle, advantages and disadvantages of CAD system, and short reports of selected applications of this detector. The main advantages of CAD detector are unique performance characteristics: better sensitivity than ELSD system, a dynamic range of up to 4 orders of magnitude, ease of use and constancy of response factors. Both detectors are mass dependent and the response generated does not depend on the spectral or physicochemical properties of the analyte. This attractive feature of a detection technique generating universal response factors is the potential use of a single, universal standard for calibration against which all other compounds or impurities can be qualified. CAD also has the same limitation as ELSD, namely,the response is affected by mobile-phase composition. This problem has been resolved by using inverse gradient compensation as is done for high pressure liquid chromatography and supercritical fluid chromatography. CAD has been applied for the analysis of structurally diverse compounds used in the pharmaceutical, chemical, food, and consumer products industries and in life science research. They include nonvolatile and semivolatile neutral, acidic, basic, and zwitterionic compounds, both polar and nonpolar (e. g. lipids, proteins, steroids, polymers, carbohydrates, peptides) ...|$|R
40|$|One problem {{encountered}} {{in the use of}} air-quality instrumentation on aircraft is the variation of instrument sensitivity with pressure as the result of altitude changes of the aircraft. Many instruments experience sensitivity changes of as much as a factor of 2 at altitudes of 6 km.

The modification provides automated mass flow rate control for both the sample and ethylene gas flows. The flow control systems maintain flow rate to within 15 percent for a 100 -torr instantaneous pressure change, and flow rates are returned to the desired set points within 10 s after the pressure change. During simulated altitude changes (300 m/min from mean sea level to 3 -km altitude), flow rates were controlled to within 3 percent of the set point.

40|$|Arsenic is {{an element}} found in the nature and {{commonly}} known as a metalloid element. Its common form in the nature is salts with oxidation states of + 3, + 5, and- 3. Despite its toxicity, arsenic is an essential element in our body, whereas in the environment, arsenic is considered a toxic metal and its presence, especially in drinking water, is closely monitored via methods such as inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry detection (ICP-MSD) or atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) with hydride generation detection. The goal {{of this research is}} to develop a fast and economic method for arsenic speciation in aqueous samples by analysis of As(III) ion with ion chromatography-chemiluminescence detection (IC-CLD). This method uses an IC column (Dionex IonPac CS 5 A mixed-bed column) for separation of As() ion from interferences caused by other metal ions. The luminescent agent used in this method is luminol and the oxidant is hydrogen peroxide. At the absence of a catalyst, luminol undergoes a slow oxidation reaction by hydrogen peroxide, while the presence of a catalyst greatly accelerates this reaction, resulting in more light given off in a short duration. The light given off in the blue region is measured by a <b>CLD</b> <b>detector</b> as a linear function of the catalyst (As()) concentration and this forms the basis of the CLD detection method. Because As(V) ions cannot be detected by the CLD system, arsenate ion has to be pre-reduced to As(III) for the determination of total arsenic concentration in a separate run, and the As(V) concentration is calculated by taking the difference between the total arsenic and the As(III) concentrations. On-line post-column reduction is impractical due to the slow reduction reaction used in this study, hence off-line reduction method was adopted instead. The reduction efficiency under ambient temperature for five minutes is at least 95 %. From the method of calibration, the linear dynamic range of this method i...|$|R
