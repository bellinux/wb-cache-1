5|$|The {{game has}} a tension gauge, {{increasing}} when a character causes damage or moves toward an adversary and decreasing when a character moves backwards or is {{stopped for a}} long time. When the gauge is half-charged a player can use specials called Overdrive Attacks, which cause more damage than regular moves. A full gauge allows a player to make an Instant Kill, defeating an opponent regardless of health; if an Instant Kill is unsuccessful, the tension gauge will not <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remainder of that round.|$|E

5|$|Brian Little, {{formerly}} {{manager of}} Aston Villa, took <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1998–99 season, and Stoke began the season impressively, holding first place until December with six straight wins. The team's form tailed {{off in the}} latter stages of the season, leading to Little's departure {{at the end of}} the season. His successor, Gary Megson, was only in the job for four months. Megson was forced to depart following a takeover by Stoke Holding, an Icelandic consortium that purchased a 66 percent share in Stoke City F.C. for £6.6m. The club's new owners appointed the club's first foreign manager, Icelander Gudjon Thordarson, in November 1999.|$|E
5|$|Cresswell {{returned}} to York as a commercial, academy {{and community development}} consultant in April 2014, having previously intended {{to pursue a career}} in coaching. He took on the position of Head of Football Operations, before being appointed as first-team coach to manager Russ Wilcox in March 2015. In May 2015, Cresswell resumed his role as Head of Football Operations, while continuing to coach the first team. He took over as caretaker manager on 26 October 2015 after Wilcox's sacking, and was assisted by youth team coach Jonathan Greening and goalkeeping coach Andy Leaning. He was in <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1–0 away defeat to Crawley Town on 31 October 2015, before ceasing his caretaker duties upon the appointment of Jackie McNamara as manager on 4 November. Cresswell left York by mutual consent on 16 December 2015.|$|E
5|$|Mills made eight {{appearances}} for Boston {{before being}} appointed the player-manager of Southern League Premier Division club Tamworth on 12 January 2001. He {{was not in}} <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> following day's 3–0 home defeat to Boston in the FA Trophy, with Tim Steele continuing as caretaker manager for this match. His first match as manager was a 2–2 home draw with Havant & Waterlooville on 20 January 2001, in which he played and scored. Tamworth finished the season in 12th place in the Southern League Premier Division, and Mills made 16 appearances and scored two goals. Tamworth missed out on promotion to the Football Conference {{on the final day}} of 2001–02, finishing second in the Southern League Premier Division, two points behind the title winners Kettering Town. He played often for Tamworth this season, making 30 appearances.|$|E

5|$|Since 1789, {{the press}} had been speculating that Garrow, a Whig, would enter Parliament; however {{he was first}} elected in 1805 for Gatton. This was a rotten borough, with Garrow {{appointed}} to {{serve the interests of}} his patron. After his entry into politics Garrow at first paid little attention, not making his maiden speech until 22 April 1806, when he opposed a <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> impeachment of Marquess Wellesley. He spoke again on 18 June 1806 on a legal technicality, and after that did not intervene for another six years. Braby and other sources indicate that he did not enjoy his time in Parliament, and was rarely there unless required to conduct some business.|$|E
5|$|Tampa starter James Shields {{shut down}} the Phillies lineup, {{scattering}} seven hits and allowing no runs in 5⅔ innings of work. Outfielder B. J. Upton (2 for 4, one run scored, one RBI) and catcher Dioner Navarro (2 for 3, one run scored) led the offensive <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Rays as Brett Myers gave up four runs (three earned) while notching two strikeouts and three walks. Rather than power-hitting Matt Stairs, Charlie Manuel opted to go with Greg Dobbs as the DH; Dobbs was 1 for 3 for the Phillies, while Victorino and Howard supplied two hits each. Cliff Floyd extended the Rays' lead to four runs after leading off {{the bottom of the}} fourth inning with a single, advancing to third base, and scoring on a Jason Bartlett sacrifice bunt. The Phillies' loss tied the series at 11.|$|E
5|$|The 1997–98 season saw Stoke move {{to its new}} ground, the 28,000 all-seater Britannia Stadium, after 119 {{years at}} the Victoria Ground, the longest time spent at a ground by any team in Britain. Chic Bates, Macari's assistant, was {{appointed}} manager for the club's inaugural season in the new ground. Bates struggled as his side slipped from a play-off place towards the relegation zone, with the club's bad run culminating in a 7–0 home defeat to Birmingham City. Bates was replaced by Chris Kamara in January 1998. Kamara could not improve the club's fortunes, and he left in April. Alan Durban, Stoke's manager two decades earlier, took <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remainder of season. Durban was unable to keep the club up, with a 23rd-place finish consigning Stoke to relegation from Division One.|$|E

5|$|The 2014–15 season saw Newcastle fail to win any {{of their}} first seven games, {{prompting}} fans to start a campaign to get Pardew sacked as manager before a six-game winning run in all competitions (including knocking holders Manchester City out of the League Cup) saw them climb to fifth in the table. After they ended Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season, Pardew left for Crystal Palace. On 26 January 2015, his assistant John Carver was put in <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the season but came close to relegation, staying up {{on the final day}} with a 2–0 home win against West Ham, with Jonás Gutiérrez, who beat testicular cancer earlier in the season, scoring the team's second goal.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} match, Moyes gave United their 20th Community Shield {{and his first}} trophy as United manager; however, after failing to lead the club to Champions League qualification, he was sacked {{before the end of}} his first season, with Ryan Giggs taking {{temporary}} <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final four games of the 2013–14 season where the club finished seventh, their lowest league finish since the establishment of the Premier League. Netherlands manager Louis van Gaal was appointed as Moyes' permanent replacement on 19 May 2014, taking charge {{after the end of the}} 2014 FIFA World Cup. In his inaugural season, United signed many prominent players and returned to the Champions League with a 4th-place finish. In his second season, United finished in 5th place behind Manchester City, out of Champions League position, but won the 2016 FA Cup, the club's first in a dozen years. The board, however, decided that not enough progress had been made from the previous season and Van Gaal was sacked on 23 May 2016, just days after lifting the cup. He was replaced by two-time European champion and former Chelsea boss José Mourinho on 27 May 2016. Mourinho became United's fourth manager (including Giggs) in as many years since Ferguson's retirement.|$|E

5|$|Parsons {{filed an}} appeal disputing the {{constitutionality}} of his first-degree murder conviction with the Utah Supreme Court. His attorney argued that Parsons had already been convicted of another <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> crime, making his murder conviction a violation of double jeopardy. On October 16, 1989, the court unanimously upheld the conviction and rejected his appeal {{on the grounds that}} Parsons should have raised that objection before he waived his right to a trial with his guilty plea. On March 5, 1990, District Judge J. Philip Eves rejected Parsons' complaint that he was denied his right to legal counsel while in prison and set his execution date for April 30, 1990. A new team of attorneys, which included Gregory Sanders and Ronald Yengich of the Rocky Mountain Defense Fund, took up Parsons' appeal that he had ineffective counsel during his trial. On January 12, 1994, the Utah Supreme Court rejected Parsons' petition for a writ of habeas corpus.|$|E
5|$|The {{youngest}} {{son of the}} Chief Constable of Essex, Poyntz made his county cricket debut in 1905, hitting a half-century to help Somerset win their only match of that season. He achieved his best batting average in that year, while {{each of the following}} four were of little note. In 1910 he captained Somerset for the first time, and scored over 300 runs in a season for the second of five occasions. His only attempts at bowling occurred during 1911, when he claimed eight wickets at an average of almost forty. He was named as Somerset's official captain in 1913, and remained in <b>charge</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> following season. After serving in the Army during the First World War, Poyntz scored his only century in first-class cricket in a match for the Army against Cambridge University in 1919. He played two further matches for Somerset that year, after which he did not appear in first-class cricket again.|$|E
