5000|$|Commercially, <b>corona</b> <b>treatment</b> {{has been}} used widely for {{improved}} dye adhesion before printing text and images on plastic packaging materials. The hazardous nature of remnant ozone after <b>corona</b> <b>treatment</b> stipulates careful filtration and ventilation during processing, restricting its implementation to applications with strict catalytic filtered systems. This limitation prevents widespread use within open-line manufacturing processes ...|$|E
50|$|Flame {{treatment}} is faster that <b>corona</b> <b>treatment,</b> but requires {{more complicated and}} expensive equipment.|$|E
50|$|X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (XPS) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS/EDX) are composition characterization {{techniques that}} use x-ray excitation of electrons to discrete energy levels to quantify chemical composition. These techniques provide characterization at surface depths of 1-10 nanometers, approximately {{the range of}} oxidation in plasma and <b>corona</b> <b>treatments.</b> In addition, these processes offer the benefit of characterizing microscopic variations in surface composition.|$|R
30|$|The {{addition}} of nanoparticles to traditional synthetic fibers is usually performed using well-known {{techniques such as}} pad-dry-cure processes; nevertheless, the appropriate surface chemistry of nanoparticles to achieve a good adhesion or even chemical bonding to the fibers is where the technological challenge is. Other techniques such as <b>corona</b> <b>treatments</b> and in situ synthesis of the nanoparticles have been successfully used as alternative functionalization techniques with very good results. Regarding to the scientific bibliography, the antibacterial functionality is the most demanded application for nanoparticles into textile fibers, due to their use in the elaboration of clothes, {{but there are other}} properties such as flammability, light absorption, and wettability that can be dramatically affected by the presence of the appropriate nanoparticles.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on presenting the changes of properties of high temperature vulcanized (HTV) silicone rubbers {{when exposed to}} 100 hours long corona/ozone treatment in a multi-needle electrode system, as suggested by CIGRE Working Group D 1. 14 and in detail reported in our former publication. The material samples were treated by either AC or DC corona sources. The HTV samples used in this test contained one type of a commercial HTV silicone rubber (including both post- and unpostcured specimens) based on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as well as model HTV silicone rubbers containing increased amount of methylvinylsiloxane (MVS) and filled with aluminum-trihydrate (ATH) of different proportions. Material characterization methods involving volume and surface resistivity measurements, dielectric response (DR) measurement, as well as tensile tests were adopted to trace the performance changes of the samples induced by the AC or DC <b>corona</b> <b>treatments...</b>|$|R
50|$|Corona {{discharges}} {{are also}} used to modify the surface properties of many polymers. An example is the <b>corona</b> <b>treatment</b> of plastic materials which allows paint or ink to adhere properly.|$|E
50|$|The <b>corona</b> <b>treatment</b> {{was invented}} by the Danish {{engineer}} Verner Eisby in 1951. Verner had been asked {{by one of his}} customers if he could find a solution which would make it possible to print on plastic. Verner found that there were already a couple of ways to accomplish this. One was a gas flame method and the other was a spark generating method, both of which were crude and uncontrollable and did not produce a homogeneous product. Verner came up with the theory that a high frequency corona discharge would provide both a more efficient and controllable method to treat the surface. Exhaustive experiments proved him to be correct. Verner's company, Vetaphone, obtained patent rights for the new <b>corona</b> <b>treatment</b> system.|$|E
50|$|Plastic {{films are}} {{typically}} formed into rolls by roll slitting. Often additional coating or printing operations are also used. Films {{can be modified}} by physical vapor deposition to make metallised films. Films can be subjected to <b>corona</b> <b>treatment</b> or Plasma processing; films can have release agents applied as needed.|$|E
40|$|In this study, corona {{discharge}} {{was applied to}} optimize the desizing of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on cotton fabric. The weight of sized fabric decreased slightly when the PVA sized fabric was treated by {{corona discharge}}. Percent desizing rate (PDR) of PVA sized fabric increased evidently after the fabric was subjected to <b>corona</b> discharge <b>treatment,</b> PDR increased with the enhancement of <b>corona</b> discharge <b>treatment</b> by increase of applied voltage and treating time. Water dissolution time and water-contact angle decreased at the same time. SEM and AFM photos show the surface of PVA film was modified into uneven morphology with many ridges pores and cracks. ATR-FTIR analysis shows that the content of C=O, ACOOH, and CAO bonds was increased after the PVA film was treated by corona discharge. Corona discharge {{can be applied to}} optimize the desizing of PVA on fabric by saving treating time and water or decrease the usage of the detergent of hydrogen peroxide; it provides a green process and energy saving method for textile finishing. ...|$|R
40|$|Natural fiber {{reinforced}} polymer composites (NFRPCs) {{have gained}} a worldwide acceptance {{as a potential}} substitute for glass filled composites over past few years especially in the automotive sector. As natural fibers are lesser in weight, easier to handle, non abrasive & cost effective, composites made from them are also sustainable & economical. Every natural fiber has its own surface morphology which decides the interfacial matrix-fiber adhesion. Some natural fibers like piassava have fine protrusions containing silica on their surface which enhances interlocking at the fiber-matrix interface and thereby improving mechanical properties of the composites. Hydrophilic nature of natural fibers creates wetting issues with the resin matrix which are mostly improved by chemical, radiation & <b>corona</b> <b>treatments.</b> The mechanical properties of natural fiber composites generally increases with volume fraction of fibers up to an optimum level, and then tend to decrease. In this review, we have given special emphasis to surface morphology of some unique natural fibers & its effect on mechanical properties of the composites. Apart from automotive sector, new horizons for application of natural fiber composites are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Ethylene {{vinyl acetate}} (EVA) {{material}} containing 20 wt% vinyl acetate (EVA 20) {{was treated with}} corona discharge to improve its adhesion to polychloroprene adhesive. Several experimental variables in the <b>corona</b> discharge <b>treatment</b> of EVA 20 were considered: corona energy, type of electrode, and number of consecutive treatments. Advancing contact angle measurements (water, 25 ±C) showed {{an increase in the}} wettability of EVA 20 after <b>treatment</b> with <b>corona</b> discharge, which corresponds to an increase in the O/C ratio on the treated surface. The higher the corona energy (i. e. the higher discharge power and longer treatment times), the greater the degree of surface oxidation. Peel strength values of the joints produced with EVA 20 using a polychloroprene adhesive containing 5 wt% isocyanate increased from 1. 5 kN/m (as-received EVA 20) to 4. 3 kN/m (corona-treated EVA 20). A mixed (adhesional C cohesive in EVA 20) locus of failure was obtained in all adhesive joints produced with corona discharge-treatedEVA 20. Finally, the number of consecutive <b>corona</b> discharge <b>treatments</b> and the surface area of the electrode (spherical versus hook-shaped electrode) did not greatly influence the adhesion of EVA 20 to polychloroprene adhesive...|$|R
50|$|Many {{substrates}} {{provide a}} better bonding surface when they are treated {{at the time they}} are produced. This is called “pre-treatment.” The effects of <b>corona</b> <b>treatment</b> diminish over time. Therefore many surfaces will require a second “bump” treatment at the time they are converted to ensure bonding with printing inks, coatings, and adhesives.|$|E
50|$|Plasma processing, <b>corona</b> <b>{{treatment}},</b> and flame {{treatment can}} all be classified as surface oxidation mechanisms. These methods all involve cleavage of polymer chains in the material and the incorporation of carbonyl, and hydroxyl functional groups. The incorporation of oxygen into the surface creates a higher surface energy allowing the substrate to be coated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{application}} of AFM on polymeric surfaces is especially favorable because polymer {{general lack of}} crystallinity leads to large variations in surface topography. Surface functionalization techniques such as grafting, <b>corona</b> <b>treatment,</b> and plasma processing increase the surface roughness greatly (compared to the unprocessed substrate surface) and are therefore accurately measured by AFM.|$|E
40|$|Polypropylene (PP) is a polymer {{with good}} {{mechanical}} properties {{which has been}} used {{in a wide range of}} applications. However, due to its inertness and low surface energy, PP has to be surface treated for applications in coatings, bonding, printing and metallization. The frequently used surface treatments for PP include plasma, <b>corona</b> and flame <b>treatments.</b> Plasma treatment of polymer surfaces has been studied extensively for many years [1]; however, it has not been used as extensively as <b>corona</b> and flame <b>treatment</b> in industry. Plasma treatments must be carried out in a vacuum and the cost of industry-scale equipment for such treatment is very high. The process parameters are highly system-dependent; the optimal processing conditions developed for one system usually cannot be adopted by another system...|$|R
40|$|The {{uncoated}} side of dispersion-barrier-coated paperboards {{was exposed}} to positive and negative direct current <b>corona</b> <b>treatments</b> in order to confirm the occurrence of backside treatment and clarify its effects on the usability of the paperboard. The main component of the coating dispersions was hydroxypropylated potato starch {{and the effects of}} talc and styrene-butadiene latex additions on backside treatment were evaluated. Coatings with a high talc proportion showed excellent initial grease resistance, but corona-induced strikethroughs caused a drastic decrease in grease penetration time. The root-mean-square roughness measurements revealed moderate surface roughening at the backside, indicating thus backside treatment. The alterations in surface free energies and rapeseed oil contact angles confirmed the occurrence of backside treatment. The high polarization potential of latex {{played a key role in}} these observations. At the same time, the inertity of talc had a stabilizing effect but it did not prevent backside treatment completely. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results verified that backside treatment occurs also when the barrier-coated side of the substrate is treated with corona, indicating that a dispersion coating layer does not prevent this undesired phenomenon. Bearing in mind that expressing customized information or including personalized elements in food packages or disposable cups and plates is under great interest, it can be assumed the exposure of packaging materials to corona will become more common in the near future, and the need for optimizing bio-based packaging materials for such purposes is obvious.

40|$|<b>Corona</b> {{discharge}} <b>treatment</b> {{is frequently}} {{used to enhance}} the adhesion between laminations, coatings, and inks to polymeric films and metal foils. This investigation concerns the application of <b>corona</b> discharge <b>treatment</b> to the enhancement of the interfacial adhesion in viscose rayon / nylon- 66 and viscose rayon / polyester (PET) sheath-core type composite fibers. Nylon- 66 and polyester (PET) core fibers were pretreated in dry air and dry nitrogen coronas prior to coating (in-line) with a viscose rayon solution (sodium cellulose xanthate) and regeneration of the (cellulosic) viscose rayon. Corona power levels of 100, 250, and 400 watts were {{used in conjunction with}} line speeds of 0. 43, 0. 54, and 0. 66 meters per second. The path length through the corona was 25. 4 centimeters. Uncoated, corona-treated samples were analyzed {{to determine the effects of}} the corona discharge on the morphology, wettability, surface radical density, linear density, and tensile properties of the core fibers. Morphological studies were conducted using scanning electron microscopy. Wettability was measured by means of a modified Washburn technique, and reported in terms of the cosine of the (liquid-solid) contact angle. Surface radical density was measured indirectly by measuring the depletion of a free radical scavenger from a solution through which the fibers were passed. Linear density and tensile properties were measured in accordance with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. Significance of the effects of corona power and line speed on core fiber properties was determined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SAS versio...|$|R
50|$|<b>Corona</b> <b>treatment</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as air plasma) is a surface modification technique that uses a low temperature corona discharge plasma to impart changes in the properties of a surface. The corona plasma is generated by the application of high voltage to an electrode that has a sharp tip. The plasma forms at the tip. A linear array of electrodes {{is often used to}} create a curtain of corona plasma. Materials such as plastics, cloth, or paper may be passed through the corona plasma curtain in order to change the surface energy of the material. All materials have an inherent surface energy. Surface treatment systems are available for virtually any surface format including dimensional objects, sheets and roll goods that are handled in a web format. <b>Corona</b> <b>treatment</b> is a widely used surface treatment method in the plastic film, extrusion, and converting industries.|$|E
50|$|Polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, vinyl, PVC, PET, {{metalized}} surfaces, foils, paper, and paperboard {{stocks are}} commonly treated by this method. It is safe, economical, and delivers high line speed throughput. <b>Corona</b> <b>treatment</b> is also {{suitable for the}} treatment of injection and blow molded parts, and is capable of treating multiple surfaces and difficult parts with a single pass.|$|E
50|$|Many {{techniques}} {{can be used}} to enhance wetting. Surface treatments, such as <b>Corona</b> <b>treatment,</b> plasma treatment and acid etching, {{can be used to}} increase the surface energy of the substrate. Additives can also be added to the liquid to decrease its surface energy. This technique is employed often in paint formulations to ensure that they will be evenly spread on a surface.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{study of}} the effect of air <b>corona</b> plasma <b>treatment</b> on the surface of GFRP (glass-fiber {{reinforced}} polymers) has been carried out. The aim is to alter the surface in a manner and scale resulting in stronger shear strength between GFRP and wood. The specimens are exposed to air corona discharge with the irradiation time and power being variables. Goniometry is employed to determine the contact angle of GFRP surface. The results show that the plasma treatment leads to the surface contact angle decreasing significantly. The shear strength of shear test specimens using isocyanate adhesive is stronger than that of specimens using epoxy adhesive. The interface of the GFRP-wood composites is also studied by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) ...|$|R
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes (L. m.) is {{an agent}} of serious {{foodborne}} illness. It {{is a major concern}} for the food industry, since microorganism, growing in biofilms is protected against cleaning and disinfection and is difficult to eradicate. Aim {{of this study was to}} develop a protocol to assess the ability of two flexible packaging materials, named HGP 40 and GND 35, submitted to <b>corona</b> discharge <b>treatment,</b> to limit the production of L. m. biofilm at 12 ± 1 °C. Two strains were selected for this study: L. m ATCC 7644 and L. m. EURL 12 MOB 098 LM isolated from dairy products. Results suggest that both L. m. strains were able to form biofilm on packaging materials tested. The differences on HGP 40 and GND 35 s treated and not treated surfaces were not statistically significant...|$|R
40|$|Surface relief grating of {{azobenzene}} polymer {{formed on}} a soda-lime-silica glass plate was treated by corona discharge {{for the formation}} of a hologram on the glass plate. The Na concentration distribution near the glass surface was investigated using a time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) depth analysis with buckminsterfullerene (C 60) ion sputtering and an image processing. The periodical Na deficient region identical to the azobenzene grating pattern existed near the glass surface, which suggested that the Na ions below the grating groove preferentially migrated to the cathode side during the <b>corona</b> discharge <b>treatment.</b> Generally, the refractive index of the Na poor region becomes lower than that of the pristine soda-lime silica glass. Therefore, the origin of the hologram on the glass surface should be the three-dimensional distribution of refractive index at the glass surface...|$|R
50|$|Plastic films {{can have}} the surface {{modified}} by <b>corona</b> <b>treatment</b> or plasma processing to allow increased bonding of the adhesive. A primer layer {{can also be used}} for this purpose. Some backings need to be sealed or otherwise treated prior to adhesive coating. This is especially important when the introduction of new materials into the adhesive can compromise the adhesive’s performance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Corona</b> <b>treatment</b> is {{a surface}} {{modification}} method using a low temperature corona discharge {{to increase the}} surface energy of a material, often polymers and natural fibers. Most commonly, a thin polymer sheet is rolled through an array of high-voltage electrodes, using the plasma created to functionalize the surface. The limited penetration depth of such treatment provides vastly improved adhesion while preserving bulk mechanical properties.|$|E
50|$|The Zisman {{theory is}} the {{simplest}} commonly used theory, {{as it is}} a one component theory, and is best used for non-polar surfaces. This means that polymer surfaces that have been subjected to heat treatment, <b>corona</b> <b>treatment,</b> plasma cleaning, or polymers that contain heteroatoms do not lend themselves to this particular theory, as they tend to be at least somewhat polar. The Zisman theory also tends to be more useful in practice for surfaces with lower energies.|$|E
40|$|As integrated-circuit device {{dimensions}} decrease, {{the importance}} of having new reliable processes for growing MOS gate oxides becomes more and more evident. Short process times and low process temperatures are desirable features in view of tight thermal budget constraints and the need for precise location of dopants. However, conventional thermal oxidation to grow high quality films usually requires relatively long oxidation times and relatively high temperature. Previous research on negative point (anodic) corona-processed SiO 2 films has shown that the thermal budget incurred using the corona process is much lower than in standard thermal oxidation due to the greatly enhanced oxidation rate. Promising results of low-T corona-processed [Special characters omitted. ] 100 Å films have shown that the films had physical characteristics comparable to those obtained in thermal oxidation. This research extends the previous work: (a) thin oxides ([Special characters omitted. ] 200 Å) are processed in order to be potentially more relevant to modern MOS processes, and (b) a more thorough electrical characterization is initiated. Electrical tests show that oxide and interface charges are comparable to thermal oxides. Breakdown characteristics are promising. The boundary between the corona-processed and control regions is found to be severely compromised. Subsequent <b>corona</b> <b>treatments</b> which overlap such boundary regions are found to restore the quality of the oxide. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy results show that the negative corona films have a different structure from that of thermal oxide films. Electrical tests on positive point (cathodic) corona-processed SiO 2 films show that the electrical quality of the films is much worse than that of standard thermally grown films, grown at a similar temperature. In the interests of growing more-uniform negative-corona SiO 2 films on broader areas of silicon wafers, experiments using multi-point or multi-needle structures were conducted. The enhancement profiles of films grown in both positive and negative cases are simulated using linear-parabolic rate constants, modified to account for the corona curren...|$|R

After joining by a roll laminator, samples were annealed at 130 ℃ for 10 min. It was found that thickness of APS gas adsorption layer on COP rapidly increased to reach constant value after several minutes, where saturation thickness was estimated to be 1. 1 nm by taking inelastic mean free path of Si 2 p photoelectron into consideration. Joining force more than 5 N/ 25 mm and long term durability in 60 ℃ and 90 % RH were also confirmed. The results of ultrathin joining thus examined can be explained in terms of formation of hydrogen and covalent bonds at the interface by low temperature reaction process...|$|R
50|$|Several factors {{influence}} {{the efficiency of}} the flame treatment such as air-to-gas ratio, thermal output, surface distance, and oxidation zone dwell time. Upon conception of the process, a <b>corona</b> <b>treatment</b> immediately followed film extrusions, but the development of careful transportation techniques allows treatment at an optimized location. Conversely, in-line corona treatments have been implemented into full-scale production lines such as those in the newspaper industry. These in-line solutions are developed to counteract the decrease in wetting characteristics caused by excessive solvent use.|$|E
50|$|Atmospheric-pressure plasma {{treatment}} {{is very similar}} to <b>corona</b> <b>treatment</b> {{but there are a few}} differences between them. Both treatments may use one or more high voltage electrodes which charge the surrounding blown gas molecules and ionizes them. However in atmospheric plasma systems, the overall plasma density is much greater which enhances the rate and degree to which the ionized molecules are incorporated onto a materials' surface. An increased rate of ion bombardment occurs which may result in stronger material bonding traits depending on the gas molecules used in the process. Atmospheric {{plasma treatment}} technology also eliminates a possibility of treatment on a material's non-treated side; also known as backside treatment.|$|E
40|$|Effects of <b>corona</b> <b>treatment</b> {{and aging}} on commercially {{produced}} corona discharged polypropylene (PP) films were followed via surface sensitive roughness analysis by {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM), water contact angle (WCA), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements. Roughness analysis by AFM gave similar results for both untreated and corona-treated samples. The measured water contact angle decreased after <b>corona</b> <b>treatment</b> but increased with aging. XPS findings revealed that <b>corona</b> <b>treatment</b> caused {{an increase in the}} O-containing species {{on the surface of the}} films, but the measured O/C atomic ratio decreased with aging. The angle dependence of the observed XPS O/C atomic ratio further revealed that surface modifications by the <b>corona</b> <b>treatment</b> were buried into the polymer away from the surface as a function of aging. This is attributed to a surface rearrangement of the macromolecules in agreement with the findings of Garbassi et al. on oxygen-plasma-treated polypropylene...|$|E
40|$|Formation {{mechanisms}} of alkali-free and high-proton concentration surfaces were investigated for a {{soda lime glass}} using a <b>corona</b> discharge <b>treatment</b> under an atmospheric pressure. Protons produced by high DC voltage around an anode needle electrode were incorporated into a sodium ion site in the anode side glass. The sodium ion was swept away to the cathode side as a charge carrier. Then it was discharged. The precipitated sodium was transformed to a Na 2 CO 3 powder when the surface contacted with air. The sodium ion in the glass surface layer of the anode side was replaced completely by protons. The concentration of OH groups in the layer was balanced {{with the amount of}} excluded sodium ions. The substitution reaction of sodium ions with protons tends to be saturated according to a square root function of time. The alkali depletion layer formation rate was affected by the large difference in mobility between sodium ions and protons in the glass. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R
