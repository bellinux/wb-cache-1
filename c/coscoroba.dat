6000|$|My chief {{ambition}} was {{to shoot}} wild duck. My brother shot them in preference to anything else: {{they were so}} much esteemed {{and he was so}} much commended when he came in with a few in his bag that I looked on duck-shooting as the greatest thing I could go in for. Ducks were common enough with us and in great variety; I know not in what country more kinds are to be found. There were no fewer than five species of teal, the commonest a dark brown bird with black mottlings; another, very common, was pale grey, the plumage beautifully barred and pencilled with brown and black; then we had the blue-winged teal, a maroon-red duck which ranges from Patagonia to California; the ringed teal, with salmon-coloured breast and velvet-black collar; the Brazilian teal, a lovely olive-brown and velvet-black duck, with crimson beak and legs. There were two pintails, one of which was the most abundant species in the country; also a widgeon, a lake duck, a shoveller duck, with red plumage, grey head and neck, and blue wings; and two species of the long-legged whistling or tree duck. Another common species was the rosy-billed duck, now to be seen on ornamental waters in England; and occasionally we saw the wild Muscovy duck, called Royal duck by the natives, but it was a rare visitor so far south. We also had geese and swans: the upland geese from the Megellanic Straits that came to us in winter--that is to say, our winter from May to August. And there were two swans, the black-necked, which has black flesh and is unfit to eat, and the white or <b>Coscoroba</b> Swan, as good a table bird as there is in the world. And oddly enough this bird has been known to the natives as a [...] "goose" [...] since the discovery of America, and now after three centuries our scientific ornithologists have made the discovery that it is a link between the geese and swans, but is more goose than swan. It is a beautiful white bird, with bright red bill and legs, the wings tipped with black; and has a loud musical cry of three notes, the last prolonged note with a falling inflection.|$|E

We captured adult birds (189 male, 157 female) from the largest population in Brazil at the Taim Ecological Reserve, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Different patterns between sexes can reflect differences in selection, and positive allometry {{may indicate that}} a character is sexually selected. We used body weight and 10 morphological measurements to examine allometric differences {{between males and females}} of C. <b>coscoroba.</b> Males were consistently larger than females. Analysis of scaling relationships against body mass showed that nostril, tail, wing and bill height were positively allometric (i. e., heavier birds had relatively larger character lengths), but there were no sexual differences in allometric slopes. However, for a given mass, mature females had longer tails, longer wings (up to metacarpophalangeal articulation) and shorter heads than males. In the light of current debate in the literature, we discuss whether such positively allometric traits and sexual differences in scaling may be indicative of sexual selection. Although <b>Coscoroba</b> Swan is a monogamous species, increasing the size of some attributes may confer some advantage for mate selection or male-male competition and, contrary to other studies, we suggest that positively allometric slopes alone should not be considered as evidence for sexual selection of the considered traits.

40|$|Context. Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be used to assess skeletal development as well as health status in wild animals. Aims. However, the information about age-related dynamics of ALP in birds, especially in precocial species, is very scarce. Therefore, before ALP measurements can be effectively interpreted, it is necessary to determine its normal variation for each species, age group and sex. Methods. Here, we report total-ALP levels of free-living <b>coscoroba</b> swans (<b>Coscoroba</b> <b>coscoroba)</b> from the most important breeding and moulting population in Brazil. Data were gathered during the moulting period and categorised according to sex and the following three different age classes: chick (n= 11), young (n= 14) and mature (n= 29). Key results. ALP levels were related to the longitudinal measure of the bones, gradually diminishing with age and showing significant differences among birds of different age classes. In all age groups, no effect of sex on T-ALP concentration was detected. Conclusions. We conclude that measuring ALP facilitates the discrimination among different-aged individuals with similar plumage characteristics and body size. © CSIRO 2010. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of modern and selected fossil geese and swans was performed using 165 {{characters of the}} skeleton, trachea, and natal and definitive integument. Five shortest trees were found (length = 318; consistency index for informative characters = 0. 634), which differed only in details of relationships among three species of Branta. The trees supported (1) iCnemiornis as sister group to other taxa analyzed; (2) a sister group relationship between the moa-nalos of Hawaii and other geese and swans; (3) Cereopsis as sister group of Anser, Branta, <b>Coscoroba,</b> and Cygnus (contra Livezey, 1986, Auk 103 : 737 - 754); (4) monophyly of Anser, Branta, and iGeochen and confirmation of generic monophyly of each; and (5) <b>Coscoroba</b> as sister group to Cygnus. Selective exclusion of fossil taxa from the analysis variably affected inferred relationships and had substantial impacts on computational efficiency. Some nodes were not robust to boot-strapping: (1) nodes relating species groups within Anser, Cygnus, and iThambetochen and (2) the node uniting Anser, Branta, <b>Coscoroba,</b> and Cygnus relative to Cereopsis. Bremer (decay) indices indicated similar differences in relative support for nodes. Skeletal characters were comparatively important in establishing higher order relationships, whereas integumentary characters were crit-ical for lower order inferences. Constrained analyses revealed that other proposed phylogenetic hypotheses entailed variable penalities in parsimony. The shortest tree(s) was considered with respect to selected ecomorphological attributes (e. g., body mass, sexual size dimorphism, clutch size) and biogeography, and a revised phylogenetic classification of the geese and swans is pro-posed.

40|$|Abstract Background Chicken repeat 1 (CR 1) is a taxonomically {{widespread}} non-LTR retrotransposon. Insertion site bias, or lack thereof, has {{not been}} demonstrated for CR 1. Recent CR 1 retrotranspositions were used to examine flanking regions for GC content and nucleotide bias at the insertion site. Results Elucidation of the exact octomer repeat sequence (TTCTGTGA) allowed for the identification of younger insertion events. The number of octomer repeats associated with a CR 1 element increases after insertion with CR 1 s having one octomer being youngest. These young CR 1 s are flanked by regions of low GC content (38 %). Furthermore, a bias for specific bases within the first four positions {{at the site of}} insertion was revealed. Conclusion This study focused on those loci where the insertion event has been most recent, as this would tend to minimize noise introduced by post-integration mutational events. Our data suggest that CR 1 is not inserting into regions of higher GC content within the <b>coscoroba</b> genome; but rather, preferentially inserting into regions of lower GC content. Furthermore, {{there appears to be a}} base preference (TTCT) for the insertion site.

Most of the 20 species are found in the cooler parts of the Northern Hemisphere, the exceptions being 3 species of Southern Hemisphere swans. All are vegetarians, obtaining much of their food from terrestrial surface vegetation in the case of geese, and from subsurface aquatic vegetation in the case of swans. The patterns of the downy young tend to be pale and simple, without strong head or back patterning, and in most species the adult plumages are also fairly simple, with whites and blacks often predominating. The white plumage of most adult swans appears to be related to visibility needs associated with their high degree of territorial spacing. The most highly territorial swans are also the most strongly vocal ones, for the same reason. However, vocalizations of the sexes are very similar, and usually differ only in minor pitch characteristics. Most of the swans and geese are quite strongly migratory, but the insular Hawaiian goose not only has become nonmigratory but also has become semiterrestrial and has evolved reduced toe webbing as it has adapted to a mountainous existence on old lava fields...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The MC 1 R (melanocortin- 1 receptor) locus {{underlies}} intraspecific {{variation in}} melanin-based dark plumage coloration in several unrelated birds with plumage polymorphisms. There {{is far less}} evidence for functional variants of MC 1 R being involved in interspecific variation, in which spurious genotype-phenotype associations arising through population history are a far greater problem than in intraspecific studies. We investigated the relationship between MC 1 R variation and plumage coloration in swans (Cygnus), which show extreme variation in melanic plumage phenotypes among species (white to black). Results The two species with melanic plumage, C. atratus and C. melanocoryphus (black and black-necked swans respectively), both have amino acid changes at important functional sites in MC 1 R {{that are consistent with}} increased MC 1 R activity and melanism. Reconstruction of MC 1 R evolution over a newly generated independent molecular phylogeny of Cygnus and related genera shows that these putative melanizing mutations were independently derived in the two melanic lineages. However, interpretation is {{complicated by the fact that}} one of the outgroup genera, <b>Coscoroba,</b> also has a putative melanizing mutation at MC 1 R that has arisen independently but has nearly pure white plumage. Epistasis at other loci seems the most likely explanation for this discrepancy. Unexpectedly, the phylogeny shows that the genus Cygnus may not be monophyletic, with C. melanocoryphus placed as a sister group to true geese (Anser), but further data will be needed to confirm this. Conclusion Our study highlights the difficulty of extrapolating from intraspecific studies to understand the genetic basis of interspecific adaptive phenotypic evolution, even with a gene whose structure-function relationships are as well understood as MC 1 R as confounding variation make clear genotype/phenotype associations difficult at the macroevolutionary scale. However, the identification of substitutions in the black and black-necked swan that are known to be associated with melanic phenotypes, suggests Cygnus may be another example where there appears to be convergent evolution at MC 1 R. This study therefore provides a novel example where previously described intraspecific genotype/phenotype associations occur at the macroevolutionary level. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{approximately}} twenty extant {{species of}} swans and true geese are, unlike the whistling ducks, primarily of temperate and arctic distribution, {{especially in the}} Northern Hemisphere. It is thus not surprising that continental North America may lay claim to at least nine breeding species, or nearly half. of the known total. Additionally, sufficient records of a tenth, the barnacle goose, are known as to warrant its inclusion in the book {{even though there is}} no indication that it nests in continental North America. Several additional Old World species of geese and swans have been reported one or more times in North America, but the likelihood of at least some of these being escapes from captivity seems so great that their inclusion seems unjustified. These species include the red-breasted goose (Branta ruficoIlis), which has been collected in California at least five times and has also been seen in recent years in Texas, Pennsylvania, and Kansas, but is not known to nest nearer than central Siberia. The bean goose (Anser fabalis) has been reliably reported from Alaska (Byrd et aI., 1974), while the smaller pink-footed goose (A. f. brachyrhynchus) has been collected in Massachusetts (Bent, 1925) and seen in Delaware (Audubon Field Notes, 8 : 10, 9 : 235). Other Old World species that have been reported, such as the lesser white-fronted goose (Anser erythropus) and the bar-headed goose (Anser indicus), appear to have represented escapes from captivity, although a specimen of the former species was recently shot in Delaware (American Birds 27 : 597). Geese and swans are generally large waterfowl that are almost entirely vegetarian in their diets. Swans forage predominantly in water, eating surface vegetation or tipping-up to reach underwater plants, but occasionally resort to eating terrestrial plants on shorelines or even in fields. Geese, however, forage both in water and on land, with some species such as brant foraging exclusively on aquatic life while others rely largely on terrestrial herbaceous plants. In most geese the cutting edges of the upper and lower mandibles are coarsely serrated in the manner of the pinking shears, providing an effective method of clipping off vegetation close to the ground. Like whistling ducks, swans and true geese have a reticulated tarsal pattern, lack iridescent or sexually dimorphic plumage patterns, and form strong, persistent pair bonds. Indeed, the fidelity of swan and goose pairs is legendary, although in actual fact this pairing behavior falls slightly short of their supposed perfect fidelity. Although some authorities recognize a larger number of genera and species, recent investigators have generally recommended that only two or three swan genera be recognized (<b>Coscoroba,</b> Cygnus, and perhaps Olor) and that the genera of typical true geese be reduced to no more than three (Anser, Branta, and perhaps Nesochen). Likewise, species limits have been enlarged in recent years, so that the Old World and New World representatives of the arctic swans are now usually considered conspecific, the 2 ̆ 2 blue goose 2 ̆ 2 is generally recognized to be nothing more than a color phase of the snow goose, a single species of brant goose is recognized, and although a larger number of Canada goose races have recently been designated they are clearly part of an intergrading series of population complexes...|$|E
