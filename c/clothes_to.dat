5|$|At 5:24pm Cooper was {{informed}} that his demands had been met, and at 5:39pm the aircraft landed at Seattle-Tacoma Airport. Cooper instructed Scott to taxi the jet to an isolated, brightly lit section of the tarmac and close each window shade in the cabin to deter police snipers. Northwest Orient's Seattle operations manager, Al Lee, approached the aircraft in street <b>clothes</b> (<b>to</b> avoid the possibility that Cooper might mistake his airline uniform for that of a police officer) and delivered the cash-filled knapsack and parachutes to Mucklow via the aft stairs. Once the delivery was completed, Cooper permitted all passengers, Schaffner, and senior flight attendant Alice Hancock to leave the plane.|$|E

5|$|The Mexican {{government}} {{declared the}} region in Nayarit near the landfall of Kenna as a disaster area, allowing for the usage of emergency funds. Immediately {{after the passage of}} the hurricane, the Mexican Red Cross prepared 180technical staff and volunteers from seven states to deliver 125MT of food, medicine, and <b>clothes</b> <b>to</b> the areas most affected. The Mexican government deployed the Mexican Army to the area to remove fallen trees and establish water treatment plants to assist the affected population. The Mexican Navy was sent to assist to support medical personnel in the San Blas area, and the government Department for Family Development assisted the Mexican Red Cross in delivering food. Grupo Modelo, brewers of Corona beer, sent 6,600gallons (25,000liters) of drinking water and 1000food sets for the San Blas area.|$|E
5|$|As {{told in the}} Kurma Purana, Bhikshatana-Shiva {{wanted to}} reveal the ignorance of the sages, who were engrossed in Dharma (righteousness) and extreme austerities but had {{forgotten}} the Samkhya (Supreme Knowledge). The naked, handsome, ithyphallic (with an erect phallus, urdhvalinga) beggar Shiva entered the forest, begging for alms from the sages' wives. They were so enamoured of him that while granting alms, they allowed their <b>clothes</b> <b>to</b> fall off and followed him, dancing and singing, love-sick. Bhikshatana was accompanied by Mohini—Vishnu disguised as Bhikshatana's enchanting wife, who maddens the sages' sons in love. The sages, unable to recognise Shiva, abused and cursed him, even assaulting him. They cursed that his Linga (phallus) should fall off. Shiva allowed it to be so and the Linga became an infinite fiery pillar of light. Anusuya, the wife of sage Atri, enlightened the sages that the couple {{was none other than}} Shiva and Vishnu. The sages thereafter worshipped the Linga. Pleased, Shiva returned to the forest as a beggar in an ugly form with his wife Parvati. Eventually, he revealed his supreme form to the sages and exalted the Pashupata vow – by which a man restrains his passion, becomes celibate, and roams naked smeared with ash – declaring that such a lifestyle would lead to moksha (salvation).|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Nathaniel Branden {{established}} Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), {{to promote}} Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited. Rand later published {{some of these}} articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion. Rand expressed opinions {{on a wide range}} of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing <b>clothes</b> <b>to</b> match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers. However, some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated, with the problem being concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York. Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.|$|E

5|$|Sakura's most {{well-known}} physical characteristic is her broad forehead. Consequently, {{because of this}} Kishimoto at times focuses too much effort on drawing it in scenes or promotional artwork where Sakura is featured prominently. This results in her forehead appearing too large. When designing Sakura in her Part II appearance, Kishimoto decided to change her <b>clothes</b> <b>to</b> a more lively karate suit style. The upper part, though, still has a Chinaesque feeling to it, {{so as to make}} her more feminine. During Part II's last story arc, Kishimoto tried making Sakura look more beautiful, most notably when she joins Naruto and Sasuke in the final fight against the creature Ten Tails. Due to Sakura having little popularity within readers, Kishimoto thought a popular fictional character, Hinata Hyuga, take a more active role and become a heroine. Despite initially deciding that Naruto and Hinata would end together, Kishimoto thought it would be interesting if Sakura formed part of a love triangle. Nevertheless, Kishimoto said romance was not what his series he wanted to focus on. In the middle of the manga's final arc Sakura is given a love letter. The real reasons for this is that Kishimoto wanted to give the anime studio material to create animated only episodes.|$|E
5|$|William Burke {{was born}} in 1792 in Urney, County Tyrone, Ireland, one of two sons to middle-class parents. Burke, along with his brother, Constantine, had a {{comfortable}} upbringing, and both joined the army as teenagers. Burke served in the Donegal Militia, until he met and married a woman from County Mayo, where they later settled. The marriage was short-lived; in 1818, after an argument with his father-in-law over land ownership, Burke deserted his wife and family. He moved to Scotland and became a labourer, working on the Union Canal. He settled in the small village of Maddiston near Falkirk, and set up home with Helen McDougal, whom he affectionately nicknamed Nelly; she became his second wife. After a few years, and when the works on the canal were finished, the couple moved to Tanners Close, Edinburgh, in November 1827. They became hawkers, selling second-hand <b>clothes</b> <b>to</b> impoverished locals. Burke then became a cobbler, a trade in which he experienced some success, earning upwards of £1 a week. He became known locally as an industrious and good-humoured man who often entertained his clients by singing and dancing to them on their doorsteps while plying his trade. Although raised as a Roman Catholic, Burke became a regular worshiper at Presbyterian religious meetings held in Grassmarket; he was seldom seen without a bible.|$|E
