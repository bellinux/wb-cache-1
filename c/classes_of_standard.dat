40|$|This paper {{develops}} an asymptotic {{theory for}} test statistics in linear panel models that are robust to heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation and/or spatial correlation. Two <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> errors are analyzed. Both {{are based on}} nonparametric heteroskedasticity autocorrelation (HAC) covariance matrix estimators. The …rst class is based on averages of HAC estimates across individuals in the cross-section, i. e. "averages of HACs". This class includes the well known cluster standard errors analyzed by Arellano (1987) as a special case. The second class {{is based on the}} HAC of cross-section averages and was proposed by Driscoll and Kraay (1998). The "HAC of averages " standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity, serial correlation and spatial correlation but stationarity in the time dimension is required. The "averages of HACs " standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity and serial correlation including the nonstationary case but they are not valid in the presence of spatial correlation. The main contribution of the paper is to develop a …xed-b asymptotic theory for statistics based on both <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> errors in models with individual and possibly time …xed-e¤ects dummy variables. The asymptotics is carried out for large time sample sizes for both …xed and large cross-section sample sizes...|$|E
