The correspondence between the <b>curried</b> function view of vector fields and the usual view taken in Physics is also explained. 1 Introduction The earth and everything in it is held together by forces that can be modeled using <b>curried</b> functions. Yet many students think that <b>curried</b> functions have little to do with their everyday experience, and so have trouble grasping the concept. Typical examples, given in texts on programming languages or functional programming, are <b>curried</b> mapping and reduction functions on lists, which connect only with students' experience in programming. A novel 1 approach is to draw more compelling examples from Physics. Once one understands <b>curried</b> functions, it is easy to understand the concept of a field in Physics. Fields are similar to <b>curried</b> functio [...] ...|$|R

5|$|A two-man {{committee}} was created {{with the aim}} of working with the Eagle and Washington clubs to resolve the debate over how many players to field in official games. Duncan F. <b>Curry</b> and William F. Ladd were chosen as the committee members, but Ladd withdrew and Adams was named as a substitute. His partner on the committee, <b>Curry,</b> had led the opposition to nine-man teams. Adams and <b>Curry</b> also differed on another issue: the length of games. At the time, a baseball game lasted until one of the teams had 21 runs; that team was awarded the victory. A change in how games were won was deemed necessary after the suspended game in 1854. Adams favored nine-inning games, while <b>Curry</b> wanted contests to last seven innings. A convention was scheduled for early 1857, and Adams joined a three-man committee tasked with encouraging local clubs to send delegates. At the convention, which consisted of one session each in January and February, Adams was voted president. The Knickerbockers had voted among themselves to back seven-inning games, but the other teams backed a motion for nine-inning contests, which passed.|$|E

40|$|Term {{rewriting}} {{system is a}} helpful tool for implementing functional programming languages. We focus upon a transformation of term {{rewriting system}}s called <b>currying.</b> <b>Currying</b> transforms a term rewriting system with symbols of arbitrary arity into another one, which contains only nullary symbols with a single binary symbol called application. <b>Currying</b> in single-sorted case is explored in [1] but <b>currying</b> in typed case remains as a problem. This paper first proposes <b>currying</b> of order-sorted term rewriting systems. Then, we prove that compatibility and confluence of order-sorted term rewriting systems are preserved by <b>currying.</b> 1 Introduction <b>Currying</b> of term rewriting systems(TRSs, for short) is a transformation from a TRS of `functional' form to another one of `applicative' form. Terms of functional form are constructed from function symbols of various arities and variables, like f(x; 2; 3). Terms of applicative form consist of variables, constants and a binary symbol called [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Historically, the Mangalorean Catholic diet was {{completely}} vegetarian. This changed during the 20th century, when {{with the advent}} of Westernisation, meat came to be consumed increasingly in the community, especially amongst the elite. Coconut and <b>curry</b> leaves are common ingredients to most curries. Sanna-Dukra Maas (Sanna is idli fluffed with toddy or yeast; Dukra Maas is pork) {{is one of the most}} popular dishes of the Mangalorean Catholic community. Rosachi Kadi (Ros <b>Curry),</b> a fish <b>curry</b> made with coconut milk (ros), is a traditional <b>curry</b> served during the Ros ceremony. Patrode, a dish of colocasia leaves stuffed with rice, dal, jaggery, coconut, and spices is popular. Kuswar are sweet delicacies prepared during Christmas and include around 22 varieties of sweets. Fish and rice form the staple diet of most Mangalorean Catholics. Par-boiled rice, known as red rice, is the traditional rice eaten and is preferred over raw rice.|$|E

Culinary spices have been cultivated in Kerala for millennia and they are characteristic of its cuisine. Rice is a dominant staple that is eaten at all times of day.

These may be accompanied by chutney, kadala, payasam, payar pappadam, appam, chicken <b>curry,</b> beef fry, egg masala and fish <b>curry.</b> Lunch dishes include rice and <b>curry</b> along with rasam, pulisherry and sambar. Sadhya is a vegetarian meal, which is served on a banana leaf and followed with a cup of payasam. Popular snacks include banana chips, yam crisps, tapioca chips, unniyappam and kuzhalappam. Seafood specialties include karimeen, prawns, shrimp and other crustacean dishes.|$|E
