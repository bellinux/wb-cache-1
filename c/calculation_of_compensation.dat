40|$|Bibliography: pages 106 - 109. This thesis {{describes}} {{techniques for}} the correction of spatial noise artifacts in a {{mercury cadmium telluride}} infrared camera system. The spatial noise artifacts {{are a result of}} nonuniformities within the infrared focal plane detector array. The techniques presented dispense with the need for traditional temperature references, and provide nonuniformity compensation by using only the statistics of the moving infrared scene and motion of the camera assembly for calibration. Frame averaging is employed, assuming that all of the detector pixels will eventually be irradiated with the same levels of incident flux after some extended period of time. Using a statistical analysis of the camera image data, the correction coefficients are re-calculated and updated. These techniques also ensure that the calculated coefficients continually track the variations in the dark currents as well as temperature changes within the dewar sensor cooling vessel. These scene-based reference free approaches to the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> coefficients in the infrared camera are shown to be successful in compensating for the effects of fixed pattern spatial noise...|$|E
40|$|Context: The {{traditional}} {{methodology for}} the control of harmonics consists {{in the use of}} passive filters tuned to the harmonic components to be eliminated. Passive filters require a frequency-demanding design to avoid resonance phenomena with other elements and they not respond to changes in the dynamics of the electric power system. Method: A best-performing solution alternative is parallel power active filters. These filters, unlike passive filters, inject compensation currents into the network and have adaptation  to changes in operating conditions. The implementation of an active filter involves hardware development but also software development. Algorithms are required for <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> currents and dc bus voltage control. Results: In this work a prototype for the harmonic compensation of 5 kVA is designed and built in three phase distribution systems of 220 V. The hardware fundamental elements are: coupling coil, capacitor, semiconductor devices and controller. The control algorithms that are responsible for the operation of the active filter at each instant of time are PQ theory, Linear Control-PWM and PI Control. Conclusions: The active power filters are a solution to the presence of harmonics in power systems. They compensate the harmonics generated by nonlinear loads and they don‘t have resonance problems and good dynamic response...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to justify special natural {{discount}} rates in the efficiency assessment of conservation activities. Nowadays, the social rate of discounting suggested by D.  Pearce is often used. However, many ecosystem values differ in such aspects as absence of high-grade anthropogenic substitutes and conservative character of natural “technologies”, and consequently simple, not expanded, reproduction. As a result, there exists the need for special discounting rate for non-replaceable production and services restricted in their reprocessing and consumption. This follows from the analysis of a consumer choice trajectory {{in the course of}} budget growth over a level at which the maximum of consumption of the limited good is reached. The paper estimates the reduction value for discounting rates for renewable natural resources restricted in regeneration in the special case of individual utility functions of the Cobb-Douglas type and, for a collective consumption, using equal-parts resource sharing among consuming community members. The idea of special discount rates for the production and non-material services of ecosystems is useful both for economic efficiency assessment of nature conservation activities and for <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensations</b> from the activities that adversely affect environment quality. </span...|$|R

40|$|The {{challenges}} {{associated with}} determining fair compensation for expropriated land have been extensively discussed and debated among scholars, practitioners, policymakers, and the public. However, to date, a {{comprehensive study of}} national-level compensation procedures established by law considering whether such procedures meet internationally recognized standards on compensation valuation has not been conducted. This article aims to {{bridge this gap by}} serving as a reference point and informing “fair compensation” debates among scholars, practitioners, and policymakers. This article examines national-level legal provisions on compensation in 50 countries/regions across Asia, Africa, and Latin America against a set of legal indicators that are based on international standards on the valuation of compensation. The legal indicators focus on the substantive and procedural requirements pertaining to the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation.</b> The indicators ask whether laws require assessors to account for various land values when calculating compensation, and whether there are legal processes in place that allow affected persons to negotiate compensation amounts, receive prompt payments, and hold governments accountable by appealing compensation decisions in courts or before tribunals. The results of the study show that most of the 50 countries/regions assessed do not have national laws that comply with internationally recognized standards on the valuation of compensation. Based on the findings from the legal indicator analysis, this paper presents a set of recommendations for reforming compensation procedures to bring them into conformity with international standards...|$|E

This landmark decision was by far the largest compensation award in the history of Indian medical negligence litigation. Hence, the process of calculating compensation for medical negligence has received great attention and debate, largely due to the impact {{that it is going to}} have on the practice of medicine within the country, in the near future. However, the method of <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> is unpredictable as it varies hugely across different cases, courts and tribunals resulting, in a loss of faith in the system, protracted litigation, and frequent appeals.

40|$|Introduction: Institutional and Independent Ethics Committees (ECs) have {{as their}} primary mission the {{protection}} of human research subjects. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization has in the period 2013 – 2016 introduced several new regulations and amendments to existing regulations overseeing the conduct of Research in India. Several of these have direct effect on {{the functioning of the}} EC from a review, approval, and oversight mechanism. Methodology: The Ethics Council of Indian Society for Clinical Research conducted a questionnaire survey among EC members to understand the impact of these changes in their functioning. The domains surveyed included awareness about recent changes/amendments and impacts, serious adverse events (SAEs) and compensation, informed consent and audio-video recording, monitoring and auditing of research, and future working of ECs. Results: Seventy-nine percent of ECs are of the opinion that the new regulations/guidelines will add to their existing burden in the process of review and approval, providing subject protection and research oversight. Even though 68 % of ECs stated that they are comfortable with SAE assessment and compensation determination, they state that there is variability in <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> amount using the formulae. An overwhelming majority (80 %) of ECs stated that they were not in favor of centralized EC for providing review, approval, and oversight of clinical studies. Discussion: Ethics Committees act as local regulator for clinical trials at sites providing Human Subject protection. The survey captures the contemporary issues faced by the ECs and also raises important questions on the ease of doing research, oversight of approved research, and administrative burden on the EC. Conclusion: Recent changes in regulations have on the one hand empowered Ethics committees but brought in challenges {{in the way that they}} provide oversight and monitor research carried out at the site...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — High {{dynamics}} of machine tool centers lead to high acceleration forces, which deform the machine structure {{and result in}} force coupling effects. In order to achieve high productivity combined with high path accuracy at existing machine tools, a numerical <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> these dynamic effects is desirable.

The expected deviations of the uncompensated system can be gathered by simulation or measurement and further be used as set trajectory for the NC (offline compensation). Since this compensation values are subjected {{to the influence of}} the set point generation and the machine structure, only a marginal reduction of the deviations can be observed.

40|$|In March 1996, the Philippines {{experienced}} one of {{its most}} serious industrial pollution accidents. The incident involved the Marcopper Mining Corporation which has been carrying out open- pit copper mining since the 1970 s. When the company finished {{one of its}} operations in Marinduque, it plugged the old pit with concrete so that it could act as a disposal pond for mine waste. In August 1995, seepage was discovered in the pit's drainage tunnel. This subsequently ruptured. The accident discharged tailings into the Makulapnit-Boac (Boac) river system. The incident resulted in the release of some 1. 6 million cubic meters of tailings along 27 km of the river and the coastal areas near its mouth. The impact on the river and the people who depend on it for their livelihoods was massive. The onrush of tailings displaced river water which inundated low-lying areas, destroying crops and vegetable gardens and clogging irrigation channels to rice fields. The release left the Boac River virtually dead. The effects of the incident were so devastating that a UN assessment mission declared the accident to be a major environmental disaster. This study set out to estimate the value of the environmental damage from the accident. One of their aims was to help formulate guidelines for damage assessment and the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation.</b> Before the accident occurred, the waters of the Boac river provided many important services to the communities along its banks. These included fishing, irrigation, laundry, washing, bathing, transport and local medicines. Some of these services have market values, while others are not easily costed in this way. To see how much damage the mining accident had caused, the study looked at the total value of the services the river provided, before and after the incident. Mining, Philippines...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I treat some leading rulings on {{compensation}} and reparation in the jurisprudence of international investment arbitrations, {{for the purpose}} of clarifying the trend of judgment upon the damage valuation criteria and methods. The recent discussion on the investment arbitration cases puts too much emphasis on various standards in substantive law, for example, expropriation, fair and equitable treatment obligation, most-favored-nation treatment obligation, and national treatment obligation. However, it is obviously the result of <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> or reparation that determines {{the success or failure of}} the investment arbitration system, and on such basis we have to evaluate whether or not the investment arbitrations perform effectively. In effect, many controversies on the substantive law, for example distinction between the expropriation and the fair and equitable treatment obligation, would eventually be transformed into the problem of whether their valuation criteria could differ or not. In this sense, the process of damages evaluation plays an important role in maintaining the balance of system in the international investment law as a whole. On the other hand, is it possible to derive generally applicable criteria for the ruling of compensation and reparation, while these are significantly influenced by particular circumstances of each case? In this regard, the following two points have been widely recognized as premises in the international investment law. In the first place, concerning expropriation measures, "reparation" amounts are normally larger than "compensation" amounts. Secondly, reparation costs more in cases of "expropriation" than that of "non-expropriation". It is the very purpose of this paper to re-examine these two premises. Firstly, while confirming the significance of the theoretical distinction between the notion of compensation and that of reparation, I point out that their valuation methods and results are identical in the practical point of view (Section I). Secondly, I am going to indicate that the recent jurisprudence does not follow the clear distinction between the expropriation case and non-expropriation one with regard to their calculation phases. I will conclude that the decisive factor for the classification of cases is whether or not there has been "a total loss" of investment assets (Section II). On the basis of the examination above, I derive finally some policy implications. ...|$|E

To test hypotheses using the F test and t test The measurement results with a range of scale through the questionnaire is known that the compensation on Cooperatives "SAE" Pujon Malang is considered to be appropriate, supported by the results <b>of</b> the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>compensation</b> variable scale ranges (X 1) with an average score of 151. 25 and non-financial (X 2) was also assessed in accordance with an average score of 163. 25. Labor productivity is also highly valued. From the results of multiple regression can be known financial compensation variable (X 1) and non-financial (X 2) have a significant influence on labor productivity. And Compensation financially stronger effect on labor productivity than non-financial compensation. Based on the above conclusions the authors suggest that the cooperative should have to maintain and increase the number kpmpensasi by considering stndar and cost the lives of the employees according to rules set by the government for the development and smooth running of cooperatives in the future life. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{electron}} energy of, e. g., 50 keV has advantages over less {{electron energy}} for X-ray mask substrates because {{the influence of}} the proximity effect is reduced. However, also in the case of writing with high energy electrons on thin membranes, the proximity effect cannot be neglected. Starting with one experimentally defined exposure dose the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> the proximity <b>compensation</b> dose is made by the Monte Carlo simulation and the proximity function. High resolution structures down to 50 nm were written on X-ray mask substrates as well as on bulk silicon wafer and compared with CAD data. The pattern placement accuracy of the e-beam system was investigated for the resolution of 50 nm over the stepfield of 3 x 3 square meter on an X-ray mask. (IMT...|$|R
40|$|Subject of Research. Existing {{adjustment}} {{methods of}} lens objectives in two mechanical designs have been analyzed, the main ways <b>of</b> centering error <b>compensation</b> have been considered. The algorithm of automated search of optical elements {{position has been}} developed based on the existing methods <b>of</b> centering for <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> residual decentering. The methods of joint application of this algorithm and centering machine “Trioptics Opticentric” have been suggested. Method. Centering errors of the objective lens components are measured on the centering machine. Aberrations of optical system are calculated by using the received data of centering errors entered to the objective mathematical model. For the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> aberration <b>compensation,</b> iteration algorithm <b>of</b> searching of optical elements optimal position is used. The image quality is analyzed for each obtained realization of the optical system. The result of program performance is data matrix about optical components location such that <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> residual aberrations occurs. Based on the obtained information the system assembling is carried out {{with the use of}} centering machine “Trioptics Opticentric”. Main Results. Computer modeling of centering errors for 100 lens apochromatic objectives of drop-in mountings lens design has been carried out. The coma of object axial point image has been chosen as quality estimation criterion. The developed algorithm has been applied for the worst realization of the optical system. In this case the value of integral coma of object axial point image has been decreased by two orders and reduced practically to zero. It is noted that the modeling of adjustment process via using the algorithm of automated search enables to predict the possibility of objective assembly with required quality parameters. Practical Relevance. The received results can be applied on the lines of automated assembly of modern lens objectives...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{considers}} source excitation {{strategies in}} finite difference time domain room acoustics simulations for auralization purposes. We demonstrate that FDTD simulations can {{be conducted to}} obtain impulse responses based on unit impulse excitation, this being the shortest, simplest and most efficiently implemented signal that might be applied. Single, rather than double, precision accuracy simulations might be implemented where memory use is critical but the consequence is a remarkably increased noise floor. Hard source excitation introduces a discontinuity in the simulated acoustic field resulting in a shift of resonant modes from expected values. Additive sources do not introduce such discontinuities, but instead result in a broadband offset across the frequency spectrum. Transparent sources address both of these issues and with unit impulse excitation the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>compensation</b> filters required to implement transparency is also simplified. However, both transparent and additive source excitation demonstrate solution growth problems for a bounded space. Any of these approaches might be used if the consequences are understood and compensated for, however, for room acoustics simulation the hard source is the least favorable due to the fundamental changes it imparts on the underlying geometry. These methods are further tested through {{the implementation of a}} directional sound source based on multiple omnidirectional point sources...|$|R
