2500|$|Some other insiders, {{including}} Arnie Gundersen, {{a former}} nuclear industry executive {{who is now}} an expert witness in nuclear safety issues, make the same claim; Gundersen offers evidence, based on pressure monitoring data, for a hydrogen explosion shortly before 2:00p.m. on March 28, 1979, which would have provided the means for a high dose of radiation to occur. Gundersen cites affidavits from four reactor operators according to which the plant manager was aware of a dramatic pressure spike, after which the internal pressure dropped to outside pressure. Gundersen also notes that the control room shook and doors were blown off hinges. However official NRC reports refer merely to a [...] "hydrogen burn." [...] The Kemeny Commission referred to [...] "a burn or an explosion that caused pressure to increase by 28pounds per square inch in the containment building". The Washington Post reported that [...] "At about 2:00pm, with pressure almost down {{to the point where}} the huge <b>cooling</b> <b>pumps</b> could be brought into play, a small hydrogen explosion jolted the reactor." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission {{states that}} it [...] "assumed" [...] melted fuel rods in unit 2 have {{released}} radioactive substances into the coolant water, which subsequently leaked out through an unknown route to the unit 2 turbine building basement. To {{reduce the amount of}} leaking water, TEPCO reduced the amount of water pumped into the unit 2 reactor, from 16 tons per hour to 7 tons per hour, which could lead to higher reactor temperatures. The highly radioactive water halts work on restoring the <b>cooling</b> <b>pumps</b> and other powered systems to reactors 1–4. TEPCO confirms finding low levels of plutonium in five samples during 21 and 22 March. Enriched levels of Plutonium-238, relative to Plutonium-239 and Plutonium-240, at two of the sites in the plant (solid waste area and field) indicate that contamination has occurred at those sites due to the [...] "recent incident". Nonetheless, the overall levels of plutonium for all samples are about the same as background Pu levels resulting from atmospheric nuclear bomb testing in the past. However, these weapons did not use fuel that has decayed significantly. Such nuclear accidents as this one are a potent source of biologically accumulating isotopes of transuranic elements such as curium and americium which are incorporated into bones, complexed into the Ca/PO4 hydroxide.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{pressure}} in the primary system continued to decrease, reactor coolant continued to flow, but it was boiling inside the core. First, small bubbles of steam formed and immediately collapsed, known as nucleate boiling. As the system pressure decreased further, steam pockets began to form in the reactor coolant. This {{departure from nucleate boiling}} (DNB) into the regime of [...] "film boiling" [...] caused steam voids in coolant channels, blocking the flow of liquid coolant and greatly increasing the fuel cladding temperature. The overall water level inside the pressurizer was rising despite the loss of coolant through the open pilot-operated relief valve, as the volume of these steam voids increased much more quickly than coolant was lost. Because of the lack of a dedicated instrument to measure the level of water in the core, operators judged the level of water in the core solely by the level in the pressurizer. Since it was high, they assumed that the core was properly covered with coolant, unaware that because of steam forming in the reactor vessel, the indicator provided misleading readings. Indications of high water levels contributed to the confusion, as operators were concerned about the primary loop [...] "going solid," [...] (i.e. no steam pocket buffer existing in the pressurizer) which in training they had been instructed to never allow. This confusion was a key contributor to the initial failure to recognize the accident as a loss-of-coolant accident, and led operators to turn off the emergency core <b>cooling</b> <b>pumps,</b> which had automatically started after the pilot-operated relief valve stuck and core coolant loss began, due to fears the system was being overfilled.|$|E
25|$|On 23 March, it was {{reported}} that the <b>cooling</b> <b>pump</b> at Reactor 5 stopped working when it was transferred from backup power to the grid supply.

40|$|The EEG {{acquired}} {{simultaneously with}} fMRI is distorted {{by a number}} of artefacts related to the presence of strong magnetic fields, which must be reduced in order to allow for a useful interpretation and quantification of the EEG data. For the two most prominent artefacts, associated with magnetic field gradient switching and the heart beat, reduction methods have been developed and applied successfully. However, a number of artefacts related to the MR-environment can be found to distort the EEG data acquired even without ongoing fMRI acquisition. In this paper, we investigate the most prominent of those artefacts, caused by the Helium <b>cooling</b> <b>pump,</b> and propose a method for its reduction and respective validation in data collected from epilepsy patients. Since the Helium <b>cooling</b> <b>pump</b> artefact was found to be repetitive, an average template subtraction method was developed for its reduction with appropriate adjustments for minimizing the degradation of the physiological part of the signal. The new methodology was validated in a group of 15 EEG-fMRI datasets collected from six consecutive epilepsy patients, where it successfully reduced the amplitude of the artefact spectral peaks by 95 +/- A 2 % while the background spectral amplitude within those peaks was reduced by only - 5 +/- A 4 %. Although the Helium <b>cooling</b> <b>pump</b> should ideally be switched off during simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions, we have shown here that in cases where this is not possible the associated artefact can be effectively reduced in post processing...|$|R

50|$|In {{traditional}} {{light water}} reactors (LWRs) the core {{must be maintained}} at a high pressure to keep the water liquid at high temperatures. In contrast, since the IFR is a liquid metal cooled reactor, the core could operate at close to ambient pressure, dramatically reducing the danger of a loss-of-coolant accident. The entire reactor core, heat exchangers and primary <b>cooling</b> <b>pumps</b> are immersed {{in a pool of}} liquid sodium or lead, making a loss of primary coolant extremely unlikely. The coolant loops are designed to allow for cooling through natural convection, meaning {{that in the case of}} a power loss or unexpected reactor shutdown, the heat from the reactor core would be sufficient to keep the coolant circulating even if the primary <b>cooling</b> <b>pumps</b> were to fail.|$|E

40|$|In an open-pool type {{research}} reactor, {{the primary}} cooling {{system can be}} designed to have a downward flow inside the core during normal operation because of the plate type fuel geometry. There is a flow inversion inside the core from the downward flow by the inertia force of the primary coolant to the upward flow by the natural circulation when the pump is turned off. To delay the flow inversion time, an innovative passive system with pump flywheel and GCCT is developed to remove the residual heat. Before the primary <b>cooling</b> <b>pump</b> starts up, the water level of the GCCT {{is the same as}} that of the reactor pool. During the primary <b>cooling</b> <b>pump</b> operation, the water in the GCCT is moved into the reactor pool because of the pump suction head. After the pump stops, the potential head generates a downward flow inside the core by moving the water from the reactor pool to the GCCT and removes the residual heat. When the water levels of the two pools are the same again, the core flow has an inversion of the flow direction, and natural circulation is developed through the flap valves...|$|R
