40|$|AbstractAn {{interesting}} and recently much studied generalization {{of the classical}} Schur class is the class of contractive operator-valued multipliers S(λ) for the reproducing kernel Hilbert space H(kd) on the unit ball Bd⊂Cd, where kd is the positive kernel kd(λ,ζ) = 1 /(1 −〈λ,ζ〉) on Bd. The reproducing kernel space H(KS) associated with the positive kernel KS(λ,ζ) =(I−S(λ) S(ζ) ∗) ⋅kd(λ,ζ) is a natural multivariable generalization of the classical de Branges–Rovnyak canonical model space. A special feature appearing in the multivariable case is that the space H(KS) in general may not be invariant under the adjoints Mλj∗ of the multiplication operators Mλj:f(λ) ↦λjf(λ) on H(kd). We show that invariance of H(KS) under Mλj∗ for each j= 1,…,d {{is equivalent to the}} existence of a realization for S(λ) of the form S(λ) =D+C(I−λ 1 A 1 −⋯−λdAd) − 1 (λ 1 B 1 +⋯+λdBd) such that <b>connecting</b> <b>operator</b> U=[A 1 B 1 ⋮⋮AdBdCD] has adjoint U∗ which is isometric on a certain natural subspace (U is “weakly coisometric”) and has the additional property that the state operators A 1,…,Ad pairwise commute; in this case one can take the state space to be the functional-model space H(KS) and the state operators A 1,…,Ad to be given by Aj=Mλj∗|H(KS) (a de Branges–Rovnyak functional-model realization). We show that this special situation always occurs for the case of inner functions S (where the associated multiplication operator MS is a partial isometry), and that inner multipliers are characterized by the existence of such a realization such that the state operators A 1,…,Ad satisfy an additional stability property...|$|E

40|$|Sensors {{are widely}} {{deployed}} in our environment, and their number is increasing rapidly. In the near future, billions of devices {{will all be}} connected to each other, creating an Internet of Things. Furthermore, computational intelligence is needed to make applications involving these devices truly exciting. In IoT, however, the vast amounts of data will not be statically prepared for batch processing, but rather continually produced and streamed live to data consumers and intelligent algorithms. We refer to applications that perform live analysis on live data streams, bringing intelligence to IoT, as the Analysis of Things. However, the Analysis of Things also comes with {{a new set of}} challenges. The data sources are not collected in a single, centralized location, but rather distributed widely across the environment. AoT applications {{need to be able to}} access (consume, produce, and share with each other) this data in a way that is natural considering its live streaming nature. The data transport mechanism must also allow easy access to sensors, actuators, and analysis results. Furthermore, analysis applications require computational resources on which to run. We claim that system support for AoT can reduce the complexity of developing and executing such applications. To address this, we make the following contributions: - A framework for systems support of Live Streaming Analysis in the Internet of Things, which we refer to as the Analysis of Things (AoT), including a set of requirements for system design - A system implementation that validates the framework by supporting Analysis of Things applications at a local scale, and a design for a federated system that supports AoT on a wide geographical scale - An empirical system evaluation that validates the system design and implementation, including simulation experiments across a wide-area distributed system We present five broad requirements for the Analysis of Things and discuss one set of specific system support features that can satisfy these requirements. We have implemented a system, called SSIoTa, that implements these features and supports AoT applications running on local resources. The programming model for the system allows applications to be specified simply as operator graphs, by <b>connecting</b> <b>operator</b> inputs to operator outputs and sensor streams. Operators are code components that run arbitrary continuous analysis algorithms on streaming data. By conforming to a provided interface, operators may be developed that can be composed into operator graphs and executed by the system. The system consists of an Execution Environment, in which a Resource Manager manages the available computational resources and the applications running on them, a Stream Registry, in which available data streams can be registered so that they may be discovered and used by applications, and an Operator Store, which serves as a repository for operator code so that components can be shared and reused. Experimental results for the system implementation validate its performance. Many applications are also widely distributed across a geographic area. To support such applications, SSIoTa must be able to run them on infrastructure resources that are also distributed widely. We have designed a system that does so by federating each of the three system components: Operator Store, Stream Registry, and Resource Manager. The Operator Store is distributed using a distributed hast table (DHT), however since temporal locality can be expected and data churn is low, caching may be employed to further improve performance. Since sensors exist at particular locations in physical space, queries on the Stream Registry will be based on location. We also introduce the concept of geographical locality. Therefore, range queries in two dimensions must be supported by the federated Stream Registry, while taking advantage of geographical locality for improved average-case performance. To accomplish these goals, we present a design sketch for SkipCAN, a modification of the SkipNet and Content Addressable Network DHTs. Finally, the fundamental issue in the federated Resource Manager is how to distributed the operators of multiple applications across the geographically distributed sites where computational resources can execute them. To address this, we introduce DistAl, a fully distributed algorithm that assigns operators to sites. DistAl also respects the system resource constraints and application preferences for performance and quality of results (QoR), using application-specific utility functions to allow applications to express their preferences. DistAl is validated by simulation results. Ph. D...|$|E

40|$|<b>Connected</b> <b>operators</b> are {{filtering}} {{tools that}} act by merging elementary regions called flat zones. <b>Connecting</b> <b>operators</b> cannot create new contours nor modify their position. Therefore, {{they have very}} good contour preservation properties and are capable of both low-level filtering and higher-level object recognition. This article gives an overview on <b>connected</b> <b>operators</b> and their application to image and video filtering. There are two popular techniques used to create <b>connected</b> <b>operators.</b> The first one relies on a reconstruction process. The operator involves first a simplification step based on a "classical" filter and then a reconstruction process. In fact, the reconstruction {{can be seen as}} a way to create a connected version of an arbitrary operator. The simplification effect is defined and limited by the first step. The examples we show include simplification in terms of size or contrast. The second strategy to define <b>connected</b> <b>operators</b> relies on a hierarchical region-based representation of the input image, i. e., a tree, computed in an initial step.

This paper presents the link between the two domains based on the observation that both <b>connected</b> <b>operators</b> and segmentation algorithms share a key mechanism: they simultaneously operate on images and on partitions, and therefore they can be described as operations on a joint image-partition model. As a result, we analyze both segmentation algorithms and <b>connected</b> <b>operators</b> by defining operators on complete product lattices, that explicitly model gray-level and partition attributes. In the first place, starting with a complete lattice of partitions, we initially define the concept of segmentation model as a mapping in a product lattice, whose elements are three-tuples consisting of a partition, an image that models the partition attributes, and an image that represents the gray-level model associated to the segmentation. Then, assuming a conditional ordering relation, we show that any region merging/classification segmentation algorithm can be defined as an extensive operator in such a complete product lattice. In the second place, we proposed a very similar lattice -based extended representation of gray-level functions in the context of <b>connected</b> <b>operators,</b> that highlights the mathematical analogy with segmentation algorithms, but in which the ordering relation is different.

40|$|<b>Connected</b> <b>operators</b> are an {{important}} tool {{for the analysis of}} greyscale images. In extending them to colour and other vector images {{there are a number of}} issues that must be addressed, in-cluding the definition of extrema, region merging criterion and the preservation of idempotence. This paper reviews the recently proposed approaches to these problems and considers some of the choices which must be made in the design of effective colour con-nective operators. An evaluation of the noise reduction performance resulting from these choices is presented. The use of the colour connected sieves in conjunction with the watershed transform for image segmentation is also investigated.
