5|$|The three-story {{brick house}} {{includes}} a full elevated basement and a mansard roof with steeply pitched gabled dormers. Projecting from the roofline are plain corbeled chimneys and iron gillwork, the original roofing material was slate. The 1879 {{version of the}} Ellwood House featured dormer ornamentation with finial work. The original windows were all double-hung and of modest size, occurring both singly and in pairs while showing a variety of lintel designs. The original front (east) facade appeared much different than it does at present. The front entryway has been completely altered, due to Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. The original entryway featured a one-story stone porch supported with two pilasters and two granite columns. The square projecting porch bay {{was connected to the}} ground via 12 stone stairs. In the southeast <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> was a full three-story projecting tower set at a 45° angle {{to the rest of the}} front facade.|$|E
25|$|In the {{southeast}} <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> a vase surrounded by six vases was found under the floor. The central vase was turned upside down, covering another vessel with a lid, in which four anthropomorphic figurines were found, {{arranged in a}} cross and looking to the four sides of the world. Two figurines were decorated with lines and had completely black heads and legs; {{the other two were}} not coloured, but they had traces of ocher red.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, a {{back porch}} {{was added to}} the home and a garage was built on the {{northwest}} corner of the lot. A year later, the new owners added a second bedroom to the northwest <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> With that addition, today’s historic structure was complete. Subsequent alterations changed some of the original characteristics. For example, in the 1970s, the original double-hung windows were replaced by aluminum frame windows. The original doors were also replaced during that period.|$|E

25|$|After Cissy Patterson reoccupied {{the mansion}} {{full-time}} in 1929, {{it became a}} center of social life in Washington, D.C. The home was decorated in Patterson's unique style. This included the heads and pelts of 13 big-game animals (deer, moose, mountain lion, and mountain goat, and others) hanging {{on the walls of}} the main staircase. The ballroom was decorated in the Louis Quinze style, with a life-size portrait of Nellie Patterson and furniture in blue, pink, and white colors. The walls of the second floor dining room were painted a deep red, and the furniture was mahogany. The second floor library was lined with bookcases and decorated with Chinese artwork. In front of each bedroom suite fireplace on the third and fourth floors were an animal skin rug. The second floor bedroom suite in the northeast <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> was painted in red.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{bedrooms}} {{and a small}} kitchenette upstairs. The master bedroom, where Mr. and Mrs. Adamson slept, is on the southwest <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> It has a large tiled bathroom, and Mrs. Adamson's clothes and hat collection remain in her closet. Next to the master bedroom is the one designed for the Adamsons' son; its bathroom has detailed tiles depicting ships and nautical scenes. The girls' bedroom in the center facing the ocean has a tremendous view {{of the ocean and}} coast. These three bedrooms open onto a large upstairs patio with the home's most spectacular panoramic view of the ocean, the Malibu lagoon and the coast in both directions. The fourth bedroom upstairs is at the eastern end of the second floor and looks out of a large Dombeya tree that blooms with spectacular bright red flowers in the spring.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, Charlie Russell {{and his new}} wife, Nancy, {{were living}} in a shack in back of a house in Cascade, Montana. In 1897, the couple moved into a rented four-room home on Seventh Avenue North in Great Falls. In December 1899, Russell's father Charles Silas Russell gave the couple $500. The estate of Mary Mead Russell, Russell's mother who died in 1895, was finally probated shortly thereafter, and in the spring of 1900 the Russells began {{building}} a new home on the corner of 13th Street and 4th Avenue North. A friend and neighbor, George Calvert, was the likely architect and constructed the house for them. The two-story wood frame building had clapboard siding, gable roof, and wooden shake roofing shingles. It had little exterior ornamentation. The house faced south, with gable fronted dormers on the east and west and another project slightly from the southwest <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> The front door led to a small front hall, and a parlor ran across the south face of the home. Also on the first floor were dining room, bathroom, kitchen, and a small maid's room off the kitchen. Some of the furniture on first floor (such as two seats, a china closet, a bookcase) were built into the home. A steep stairway led to three small bedrooms (under the gables) and a small bathroom on the second floor. The interior was paneled in dark wood. A small exterior porch ran around the southeast corner of the home. The architectural style was in the Arts and Crafts genre. The Russells occupied the home in the summer of 1900.|$|E

About 700 ZIPRA combatants continued to attack C Company's position at the Alamo, putting it under constant machine gun and mortar fire. Pocketed, Dyck responded in kind. About 02:00 on 12 February, a ZIPRA guerrilla with an RPD machine gun took up a position in a house to the Alamo's south-east and [...] "became a nuisance", as the major put it; he and Sergeant Vini Hlatshwayo went out with an RPG-7 rocket launcher and fired at the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> bringing it down on the gunner and killing him.|$|E
500|$|The {{west and}} east sides match each other. Most houses have two storeys, but some rise to three; {{all have a}} {{basement}} and a three-window range with sash windows. [...] The entrances are in the rear elevation and are paired under single doorcases with cornices, architraves and fanlights. [...] The windows are topped by similar architraves. At the front, facing the garden, the hipped roofs of the main sections have prominent eaves, and the roofs of the tower sections have similar treatment. Number 1, at the southwest corner, has ground-floor rustication carried round on to its south-facing wall, and its windows are different. Similarly, number 48—the end house at the southeast corner—has a hipped-roofed south-facing wing with a hipped roof, in which the entrance {{is set in a}} doorcase flanked by antae. [...] The <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is chamfered and has a blank two-window range. Several houses in {{the east side of the}} crescent have dormer windows in their attic space.|$|E
500|$|The rear hall again uses old oak high {{paneling}} and has small six by nine inch oil {{portraits of}} Renaissance figures. Freestanding Corinthian columns {{in the hallway}} form an ornamental gateway and stained glass doors at the end enter the rear porch arcade. The dining room was furnished with oak bought later from Redbourn Manor in Hertfordshire and has an imposing Portland stone fireplace positioned midway in the room. [...] The floor is made of old re-sawn pegged oak and the Tudor rose ceiling motif is repeated. The gallery room, {{which was to be}} used for the exhibition of artwork and historic artifacts from the Virginia Historical Society collection, is located in the northwest <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> and furnished with vertical oak paneling and a zenitherm floor. [...] In the southeast wing of the house is the Sulgrave Room, a reproduction of the great hall from the Washington family's Sulgrave Manor. The fireplace mantel is made of an oak [...] beam, once used at the original priory. [...] Heavy oak timbers were used to construct the open beam ceiling in this room, which also features mottled plaster walls.|$|E

50|$|The cube shape {{distinctive}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bahay Kubo {{arises from}} the fact that it is easiest to pre-build the walls and then attach them to the wooden stilt-posts that serve as <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>The</b> construction <b>of</b> a Bahay Kubo is therefore usually modular, with the wooden stilts established first, a floor frame built next, then wall frames, and finally, the roof.|$|R
500|$|Traditional peasants' houses {{throughout}} Imerina {{featured a}} thick central pillar (andry) {{that supported the}} roof beam and a smaller upright beam at each corner extending into the ground to stabilize the structure. [...] Unlike most coastal houses, Highland homes have never been raised on stilts but have always sat flush to the ground. [...] To {{the south of the}} central pillar, in the area designated for sleeping and cooking, wooden or bamboo planks were occasionally installed for flooring, or woven mats were laid on the packed earth floor, which extended north past the pillar. Traditionally, the bed of the head of the family was in the southeast <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> [...] The northern area was distinguished by the hearth, delineated by three oblong stones set vertically into the ground. Houses and tombs were aligned on a north-south axis with the entrance on the west face. [...] The north portion of the house was reserved for males and guests, while the south was for women, children and those of inferior rank. The northeast corner was sacred, reserved for prayer and offerings of tribute to the ancestors.|$|E
500|$|On Wednesday, March 3, 1993, in Rancho Viejo, Texas, an {{affluent}} community {{just north of}} Brownsville, Fischer woke up early {{to get ready for}} school. Just before 7:00a.m., he went to the garage and reversed his mother's car into the circular driveway at his home at 3 Cortez Avenue. He then walked toward the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and grabbed a garden hose to spray water on the car's windows, which were covered in dust. As he sprayed the car, someone came from behind and shot him twice at point-blank range with what would later be identified as a [...]38 Super pistol. One of the shots penetrated his chest and the others his brain. Fischer's mother looked out the window to see what had happened, thinking the noise came from one of the house's palm tree branches falling on the roof, or that the car had backfired. She did not see the car, and thought that perhaps her son had gone to a convenience store to pick up something, but Fischer's brother Eric told her he could see the car parked on the driveway.|$|E
2500|$|The {{external}} appearance of Leadhills is ugly beyond description: rock, short heath, and barren [...] Every sort of vegetable is with difficulty raised, and seldom comes to perfection.

They pick up arsenical particles with their food, which, soon kills, them. Horses, cows, dogs, cats, are liable to the lead-brash.

2500|$|Louisa was [...] {{long and}} weighed 10 tons on its {{carriage}}. Six men were sent ahead to widen {{some parts of}} the road that were too narrow while about 100 people, helped by 18 horses from Lynton, hauled the boat up the 1 in 4 (25%) Countisbury Hill. The carriage had to be repaired at one point when a wheel came off. At {{the top of the hill}} they took refreshments at the Blue Ball Inn then most of the people including the women and children turned back, leaving just 20 men to control the boat as it descended another 1 in 4 hill down into Porlock. More horses were obtained to bring the team up to about 20 (although four died during the journey). At Porlock the road was too narrow because of a wall but the owner let the men take down the <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> so that they could pass. Lower down a road had been washed away by the sea so a detour was necessary. The lifeboat finally reached the sea at 06:30 on 13 January.|$|E
