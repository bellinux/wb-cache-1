The stability equations are obtained using the limit equilibrium (LE) conditions. The additions of vertical, horizontal and rotational equilibria are transformed mathematically {{with respect to}} the soil shearing strength, leading to the derivation of the equation of the functional Q, and two integral constraints. Generally, no constitutive law beyond the <b>Coulomb’s</b> <b>yield</b> criterion is incorporated in the formulation. Consequently, no constraints are placed on the character of the criticals except the overall equilibrium of the failing soil section. The critical normal stress distribution, �min, and consequently the load, Qmin, determined {{as a result of the}} minimization of the functional are the smallest stress and load parameters that can cause failure.

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding {{the flow}} of {{granular}} materials is of utmost importance for numerous industrial applications including the manufacturing, storing and transportation of grain assemblies (such as cement, pills, or corn), {{as well as for}} natural risk assessing considerations. Discrete Element Modeling (DEM) methods, which explicitly represent grain-grain interactions, allow for highly-tunable and precise simulations, but they suffer from a prohibitive computational cost when attempting to reproduce large scale scenarios. Continuum models have been recently investigated to overcome such scalability issues, but their numerical simulation still poses many challenges. In this work we propose a novel numerical framework for the continuous simulation of dilatable materials with pressure-dependent (<b>Coulomb)</b> <b>yield</b> stress. Relying upon convex optimization tools, we show that such a macroscopic, nonsmooth rheology can be interpreted as the exact analogous of the solid frictional contact problem at the heart of DEM methods, extended to the tensorial space.

40|$|This study uses an {{incompressible}} smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (ISPH) {{model to}} investigate the run-out and deposit morphology of granular materials flowing down cut slopes. The primary aim is to study the influence of various factors on the run-out and to summarise a quantitative relationship for direct use in landslide hazard management. In the model, the granular materials are modelled as a rigid perfectly plastic material with a <b>Coulomb</b> <b>yield</b> surface. The coupled continuity equation and momentum equation are solved by a semi-implicit algorithm. The model is first validated and its results are carefully compared with various controlled experiments regarding granular flows. The model reproduces the flows and correctly predicts the deposition profiles under various conditions. Then, the computational results are used to study the run-out and mobility of landslides. For granular columns collapsing onto a flat surface, a normalised run-out and a new scaling relationship are proposed, which are supported by numerous measured and numerical results. A similar relationship for the run-out of granular rectangles on steep slopes has also been explored. It is found that the normalised run-out is mainly determined by the slope angle and the normalised drop height. Furthermore, three types of idealised cut-slope landslides are simulated to study {{the influence of the}} initial landslide shape on the run-out. It is found that the normalised run-out of these idealised cut-slope landslides is smaller than that of granular rectangles on slopes of the same angles and drop heights. The difference between the run-outs is found to be mainly determined by the proportion of the whole mass that initially lies above a predictable discontinuity plane.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 143 - 154. The {{advent of}} {{cemented}} joint replacements has revolutionised {{the management of}} patients suffering from chronic arthritis. However, establishing a durable bond between the prosthesis and the surrounding bone remains a considerable problem. As a result, cementless implants have been developed. These components rely on the ingrowth of bone into a porous coating, which covers {{a portion of the}} component surface, to achieve the required mechanical interlock. Once mineralised bone tissue has formed within. the porous surface, a stable bond results which will be maintained by the normal bone turnover processes, thereby providing long term attachment. However, one of the problems {{associated with the use of}} cementless implants is the unpredictability of the extent of bone ingrowth. The process of osseo-integration is greatly influenced by the magnitude of the micro-motion between the implant and the surrounding bone. Large movements inhibit ingrowth, and may result in the formation of an interfacial fibrous tissue layer. In addition, interface strains will influence the early repair process and guide long term bone remodelling within this region. A numerical model for the prediction of bone formation within the porous surface has been developed. The evolution laws consider the early repair activity, possible fibrous tissue formation, and long term remodelling, as a function of the history of inelastic relative displacements and elastic interface strains. The model is based on the development of an isoparametric interface element, which is suitable for implementation into a non-linear finite element code. In the unbonded condition, the contact is governed by a Coulomb friction formulation. The position and shape of the <b>Coulomb</b> <b>yield</b> surface is altered according to the evolution equations, which govern the development of mineralised tissue within the surface porosity. The strain history and post-operative time are then used to develop a stimulus coefficient, which determines the course of the interface tissue development. If bone tissue is predicted, the subsequent interfacial material will be governed by a remodelling algorithm for the prediction of the long term response. If the bond strength is exceeded, fracture occurs and the joint may open or slide, thus returning to its original, unbonded, state. In the event of large micro-motions, the yield surface and material formulation are altered to include fibrous tissue. The model is used to predict the development of interfacial tissues at the porous surface of a tibial tray component, with a central peg and a PCA (Howmedica, Inc.) femoral stem. Although many factors influence interfacial tissue development, mechanical loads are assumed to be dominant. In the short term, the relationship between micro-motion and interface tissue response has been shown. However, long term remodelling of interfacial tissues has not been widely demonstrated and, therefore, additional experimental data is required to validate the current long term remodelling predictions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the absence}} of thermal agitation, {{granular}} materials are often found in a metastable state {{in the sense that}} a partial flow of grains may occur in response to a small perturbation. The flow is transient in nature and stops as the grains get jammed in a new metastable state. The prediction of the onset and propagation of such transient granular flows and their arrest is crucial to practical issues such as risk assessment with respect to landslides and granular avalanches in geotechnics, silo discharge and plug flow in pipelines. The fragile nature of metastable states leads to a fluctuating behavior with marked spatial correlations and broad distributions of the number of mobilized grains, flow lifetimes or resulting macroscopic deformations. In this talk, I discuss the stochastic nature of these dynamic events and their spatial correlations in two different systems by mean of extensive contact dynamics simulations. The first system is a silo in the jamming regime, i. e. a silo with an opening sufficiently small that the flow stops in finite time. The temporal behavior will be analyzed with the outlet size R as control parameter. Our numerical data are consistent with a stationary Poisson process: 1) for the sequence of passing grains with the flow rate Q(R) as parameter, and 2) for the sequence of jamming events with the mean number ⟨N⟩(R) of passing grains between consecutive jams as parameter. This feature reveals {{the absence of}} memory in the process as a consequence of chaotic dynamics in the fluidized zone above the outlet. We show that the function ⟨N⟩(R) is dictated by the Beverloo law at small R and by a diverging mean flow lifetime ⟨T ⟩ as a critical opening is approached. The second system that will be considered in this talk is a granular bed subjected to gradual rotation. The principal stress directions rotate with respect to the free surface until a surface avalanche is initiated. However, as long as the slope angle is below the avalanche angle, the granular layer undergoes a gradual plastification as a result of local instabilities and rearrangement events. I will focus for this system on the spatial correlations. We introduce an order parameter defined as the density of critical contacts, i. e., contacts where the friction is fully mobilized. The spatial correlation of critical contacts reveals the occurrence of ʻʻfluidizedʼʼ clusters which exhibit a power-law divergence in size at the approach of the avalanche limit. At the same time, an increasingly large number of grains are overloaded {{in the sense that they}} are found to carry a stress ratio above the <b>Coulomb</b> <b>yield</b> threshold of the whole packing. Using this property, a coarse-graining length scale is introduced at which all stress ratios are below the packing yield threshold. This length increases with the slope angle and jumps to a length comparable to the depth of the granular bed at an angle below the avalanche angle. This transition coincides with the onset of dilation in the packing. We map this transition into a percolation transition of the overloaded grains...|$|E
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} an attempt to {{investigate}} the interference effects on the magnitudes of the ultimate failure loads for a group of closely spaced strip footings and strip plate anchors. On account of {{an increase in the number}} of different civil engineering structures, footings and anchors are often need to be placed very close to each other. In such a situation, the ultimate bearing capacity/pullout capacity of an interfering footing/anchor becomes significantly different from that of a single isolated footing/anchor. The effect of interference on the magnitude of failure load is usually expressed in terms of an efficiency factor (%y); where £,y is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the failure load for a strip footing/anchor of a given width in the presence of other footings/anchors to that of the magnitude of the failure load for an isolated single strip footing/anchor having exactly the same width. No rigorous analysis seems to have been carried out so far in literature to investigate the interference effect for a group of footings and anchors. In the present study, it is intended to use rigorous numerical upper bound limit analysis in combination with finite elements and linear programming in order to determine the collapse loads for the problems of both isolated and a group of footings and anchors. Three noded triangular elements are used throughout the thesis for carrying out the analysis for different problems. The velocity discontinuities are employed along the interfaces of all the elements. The plastic strains within the elements are incorporated by using an associated flow rule. The Mohr <b>Coulomb</b> <b>yield</b> surface is linearised by means of an exterior regular polygon circumscribing the actual failure surface so that the finite element formulation leads to a linear programming problem. In solving the different problems taken in this thesis, computer programs were developed using 'MATLAB' with the usage of 'LINPROG' - a library subprogram for doing the necessary optimization. The bearing capacity factor Ny for an isolated single rigid strip footing placed on a cohesionless ground surface has been computed and its variation with respect to the footing-soil roughness angle (8) has been examined in detail. It is clearly noted that an increase in 8 leads to a continuous increase in Ny. The solution is also obtained for a perfectly rough footing without considering any velocity discontinuity surface along the footing-soil interface. With 5 = Scr/B. ' In the case of a group of multiple strip footings, the value of £y is found to increase continuously with a decrease in S/B. The effect of the variation of spacing on §y is found to be very extensive for small values of S/B; the magnitude of ^y approaches infinity at S/B = 0. For all the values of S/B ground heave is invariably observed on both the sides of the footings. The magnitudes of ^Y for given values of S/B and 2 c/tan<j), the uplift resistance of anchors in the group becomes equal to that of an isolated anchor, and no interference is seen to exist; where d is the depth of anchor. By examining the nodal velocity patterns, it was noted that in the event of collapse, a wedge of soil mass just above the anchors and encompassed within linear rupture surfaces moves vertically upward almost as a single rigid unit with the velocity same as that of the anchor plate itself. On this basis, a closed form solution of the problem has been developed. The results from the closed form solution for the group of two anchors as well as for multiple anchors are found to provide an excellent comparison with the rigorous upper bound numerical solution especially for the value of § greater than or equal to about 35 °. For all the problems taken in this study, it has been seen that an upper bound limit analysis in combination with finite elements and linear programming is a very useful numerical tool for determining the magnitudes of collapse loads...|$|E

40|$|Resistance {{oscillations}} {{in electronic}} Fabry-Perot interferometers near fractional quantum Hall (FQH) filling factors 1 / 3, 2 / 3, 4 / 3 and 5 / 3 in the constrictions are compared to corresponding oscillations near integer quantum Hall (IQH) filling {{factors in the}} constrictions, appearing in the same devices {{and at the same}} gate voltages. Two-dimensional plots of resistance versus gate voltage and magnetic field indicate that all oscillations are Coulomb dominated. Applying a <b>Coulomb</b> charging model <b>yields</b> an effective tunneling charge e* ≈ e/ 3 for all FQH constrictions and e* ≈ e for IQH constrictions. Surprisingly, we find a common characteristic temperature for FQH oscillations and a different common characteristic temperature for IQH oscillations...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{conductivity}} (OC) {{can serve}} as a measure of correlation effects {{in a wide range of}} condensed matter systems. We here show that the long-range tail of the <b>Coulomb</b> interaction <b>yields</b> a universal correction to the OC in a three-dimensional Weyl semimetal σ(Ω) =σ_ 0 (Ω) [1 + 1 /N+ 1], where of σ_ 0 (Ω) =Ne^ 2 _ 0 Ω/(12 h v) is the OC in the non-interacting system, with v as the actual (renormalized) Fermi velocity of Weyl quasiparticles at frequency Ω, and e_ 0 is the electron charge in vacuum. Such universal enhancement of OC, which depends only on the number of Weyl nodes near the Fermi level (N), is a remarkable consequence of an intriguing conspiracy among the quantum-critical nature of an interacting Weyl liquid, marginal irrelevance of the long-range Coulomb interaction and the violation of hyperscaling in three dimensions, and can directly be measured in recently discovered Weyl as well as Dirac materials. By contrast, a local density-density interaction produces a non-universal correction to the OC, stemming from the non-renormalizable nature of the corresponding interacting field theory.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{microscopic}} description of heavy fermions in UPt 3. It {{is based on}} the assumption that two of the three 5 f electrons of the U ions are localized. Band-structure calculations based on this supposition reproduce the observed de Haas-van Alphen frequencies very well. The observed enhancement of the quasi-particle mass as compared with the. local-density approximation band mass results from the local Coulomb interaction of the delocalized f electrons with the localized ones. Diagonalization of the <b>Coulomb</b> interaction matrix <b>yields</b> the level scheme of the localized f(2) states. Assuming a splitting of the ground-state doublet by the crystal field of similar size as in UPd 2 Al 3 results in a masks enhancement factor of order 10 in agreement with experiments...|$|R
