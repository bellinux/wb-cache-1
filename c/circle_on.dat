5|$|At the DAP, Hitler met Dietrich Eckart, {{one of the}} party's founders and {{a member}} of the occult Thule Society. Eckart became Hitler's mentor, exchanging ideas with him and {{introducing}} him to a wide range of Munich society. To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers Party; NSDAP). Hitler designed the party's banner of a swastika in a white <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> a red background.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} {{months of the}} war, Hand {{increasingly}} supported President Woodrow Wilson's post-war foreign policy objectives. He believed the United States should endorse the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles, despite their flaws. This position estranged him from Croly and others at The New Republic, who vehemently rejected both. Alienated from his old <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> the magazine and by the reactionary and isolationist mood of the country, Hand found himself politically homeless.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} a Calabi–Yau manifold is a two-dimensional torus or donut shape. Consider a <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> this surface that goes once through the hole of the donut. An example is the red circle in the figure. There are infinitely many circles like it on a torus; in fact, the entire surface is a union of such circles.|$|E
25|$|The conformality of the {{stereographic}} projection implies {{a number of}} convenient geometric properties. <b>Circles</b> <b>on</b> the sphere that do not pass through the point of projection are projected to <b>circles</b> <b>on</b> the plane. <b>Circles</b> <b>on</b> the sphere that do pass through the point of projection are projected to straight lines on the plane. These lines are sometimes thought of as circles through the point at infinity, or circles of infinite radius.|$|R
50|$|Both the pencils of <b>circles</b> <b>on</b> the torus (shown in the picture) are mapped on the {{corresponding}} pencils of <b>circles</b> <b>on</b> the cyclide. In {{case of a}} self-intersecting torus one would get a spindle cyclide.|$|R
25|$|Hipparchus was {{the first}} to show that the {{stereographic}} projection is conformal, and that it transforms <b>circles</b> <b>on</b> the sphere that do not pass through the center of projection to <b>circles</b> <b>on</b> the plane. This was the basis for the astrolabe.|$|R
5|$|A 19th-century ethnographic account {{from eastern}} Herzegovina {{describes}} a way through {{which a man}} who was not born as a zduhać could become one. Forty days after he ceased praying to God and washing his face, the man should go to some level ground, before he drew a <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> the ground and sat in its centre. Soon the Devil would come and ask the man whether he was willing to join his army, and what form he wanted to be transformed into. When the man stated the desired form, the Devil would turn him into that, making him a zduhać. In the region of Semberija, northeast Bosnia, а zduhać could pass his supernatural power on to his son.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, DeWitt {{announced}} plans for the Cardinals to renovate a baseball field in Sosúa in Taveras's honor, modeled after the Cardinals Care facilities in Greater St. Louis. The team would also wear black circular patches inscribed with OT (Taveras's initials) inside a white <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> their jerseys. The patch will omit Taveras's No. 18 because Martínez is already wearing it as his uniform number as a tribute. A large decal in his memorial was posted in the home team bullpen of Busch Stadium along with the ones of Hancock and former pitcher Darryl Kile, who died of coronary artery disease during the 2002 season while still active.|$|E
5|$|On {{its passage}} northward, Southern Cross halted at Franklin Island, off the Victoria Land coast, {{and made a}} series of {{magnetic}} calculations. These indicated that the location of the South Magnetic Pole was, as expected, within Victoria Land, but further north and further west than had previously been assumed. The party then sailed for home, crossing the Antarctic <b>Circle</b> <b>on</b> 28 February. On 1 April, news of their safe return was sent by telegram from Bluff, New Zealand.|$|E
40|$|Convex {{geometries}} are closure systems satisfying anti-exchange axiom with combinatorial properties. Every convex geometry {{is represented}} by a convex geometry of points in n-dimensional space with a special closure operator. Some convex geometries are represented by <b>circles</b> <b>on</b> a plane. This paper proves that not all convex geometries are represented by <b>circles</b> <b>on</b> a plane by providing a counterexample. We introduce Weak n-Carousel rule and prove that it holds for confgurations of <b>circles</b> <b>on</b> a plane...|$|R

5|$|Reitman needed fifty days to film Up in the Air, {{eight of}} which were devoted to aerial shooting. The aerial shots {{turned out to be}} more {{difficult}} than expected. He was unable to use three days of the aerial filming. Many aerial shots, such as the crop <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> fire, are seen in the Paramount trailer, but are not used in the film. The pilot who flies the Boeing 747 that carried the space shuttle flew the aircraft for the aerial shots.|$|E
5|$|Southern Cross left London on 23 August 1898, after {{inspection}} by HRH the Duke of York (the future King George V), {{who presented}} a Union Flag. Along with the expedition's personnel, equipment and provisions {{the ship was}} carrying Siberian sledge dogs, {{the first to be}} taken on an Antarctic expedition. After final provisioning in Hobart, Tasmania, Southern Cross sailed for the Antarctic on 19 December. She crossed the Antarctic <b>Circle</b> <b>on</b> 23 January 1899, and was then caught in the pack ice for three weeks. Cape Adare was sighted on 16 February, and the following day the ship was anchored close to the shore.|$|E
5|$|The Shenandoah {{destroyed}} {{one more}} prize in the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, then continued to the Aleutians {{and into the}} Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean, crossing the Arctic <b>Circle</b> <b>on</b> June 19. Continuing then south {{along the coast of}} Alaska the Shenandoah came upon a fleet of Union ships whaling on June 22. She opened continuous fire, destroying a major portion of the Union whaling fleet. Capt. Waddell took aim at a fleeing whaler, Sophia Thornton, and at his signal, the gunner jerked a wrist strap and fired the last two shots of the American Civil War. Shenandoah had so far captured and burned eleven ships of the American whaling fleet while in Arctic waters.|$|E
40|$|The densest known {{packing of}} 15 {{congruent}} <b>circles</b> <b>on</b> a sphere occurs in two equally dense varieties. Previously, {{this was the}} only known example of a ‘best’ packing of n <b>circles</b> <b>on</b> a sphere with multiplicity greater than one. We present three new examples: n= 62, 76 and 117. We discuss these and related examples as manifestations of symmetry breaking involving structures we call “rotational toggle hexagons”. Additionally, we present exact data for n= 15, and observe that both the hexagonal packing of the plane and the icosahedral packing of 12 <b>circles</b> <b>on</b> a sphere arise as limiting cases from toggle hexagons...|$|R

As it turns to nighttime, the camp is the main setting; they conduct a football match and afterwards a pool party. The video ends with One Direction looking at the camera, with Malik singing the last line. Throughout the video, teenage boys and girls are showing with the band.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of human existence on the moors around Bolton since {{the early part of}} the Bronze Age, including a stone <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> Cheetham Close above Egerton, and Bronze Age burial mounds on Winter Hill. A Bronze Age mound was excavated in Victorian times outside Haulgh Hall. The Romans built roads from Manchester to Ribchester to the east and a road along what is now the A6 to the west. It is claimed that Agricola built a fort at Blackrod by clearing land above the forest. Evidence of a Saxon settlement exists in the form of religious objects found when the Victorian parish church was built.|$|E
5|$|A Very Gaga Thanksgiving {{initially}} {{aired on}} November 24, 2011 in the United States on ABC. It attained 5.749 million viewers and garnered a 1.8/5 rating in the 18–49 demographic {{in its first}} hour. Gaga's special aired simultaneously with the reruns of The Simpsons on FOX, Person of Interest on CBS, and The Secret <b>Circle</b> <b>on</b> The CW. In its second hour, total viewership and ratings slightly declined to 5.388 million viewers and a 1.6/5 ratings in the 18–49 demographic, despite airing simultaneously with a recap of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on NBC and a rerun of The Mentalist on CBS. A Very Gaga Thanksgiving failed to beat other Thanksgiving specials in the ratings, including A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving. A Very Gaga Thanksgiving had the highest rating in the 18–49 demographic in its time slot, and total viewership increased by 23% (1.3 million viewers) from its predecessor, singer Beyoncé's 2009 concert, I Am... World Tour. It subsequently gave ABC its best ratings in four years for its respective time slot on Thanksgiving Day.|$|E

5|$|Burst {{time offset}} (BTO) – the time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent from the ground station and when the response is received. This measure is proportional to twice {{the distance from the}} ground station via the satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station. This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft. As a result, one can define a <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> the Earth's surface the points on whose circumference are equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance, and in turn this circle can be reduced to arcs by eliminating parts of the circle that are outside the aircraft's range.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{construction}} {{began on}} the Keeler Street Expressway, a limited-access highway extending across Irondequoit from the Genesee River (at the Veterans Memorial Bridge) to the Sea Breeze Expressway. The first section from North Goodman Street to the Sea Breeze Expressway was completed by 1968 while the remainder opened in late 1969. The name of the expressway was derived from Keeler Street, a small residential street that originally connected to East Ridge Road and St. Paul Street {{by way of a}} traffic <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> the east bank of the Genesee River. The street was turned into a dead-end street {{as a result of the}} expressway's construction. US104 was moved from East Ridge Road to the expressway, which remains known, albeit infrequently, as the Keeler Street Expressway to this day. NY18 remained on East Ridge Road, however, reducing the overlap between US104 and NY18 to just the portion on the Veterans Bridge. NY18 was truncated to its current eastern terminus , eliminating the overlap entirely.|$|E
5|$|Scotland Yard issued another {{appeal in}} March 2014 for {{information}} {{about a man who}} had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white <b>circle</b> <b>on</b> the back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010. The Polícia Judiciária reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.|$|E

The eastern end was extended four stations to Silver Spring on February 6, 1978 – which added Maryland to the system for the first time – two stations to Wheaton on September 22, 1990 and one station to Glenmont on July 25, 1998, completing the line.|$|E
5|$|The DR {{connected}} to the MR (now the Metropolitan line) at South Kensington and, although the two companies were rivals, each company operated its trains over the other's tracks in a joint service known as the Inner <b>Circle.</b> <b>On</b> 1 February 1872, the DR opened a northbound branch from its station at Earl's Court to connect to the West London Extension Joint Railway (WLEJR, now the West London Line) at Addison Road (now Kensington (Olympia)). From that date the Outer Circle service began running over the DR's tracks. The service was run by the North London Railway (NLR) from its terminus at Broad Street (now demolished) in the City of London via the North London Line to Willesden Junction, then the West London Line to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House – {{at that time the}} eastern terminus of the DR.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} left England on 30 September 1839, {{and after}} a voyage that was slowed by the many stops required to carry out work on magnetism, it reached Tasmania in August 1840. Following a three-month break imposed by the southern winter, they sailed south-east on 12 November 1840, and crossed the Antarctic <b>Circle</b> <b>on</b> 1 January 1841. On 11 January a long mountainous coastline that stretched to the south was sighted. Ross named the land Victoria Land, and the mountains the Admiralty Range. He followed the coast southwards and passed Weddell's Farthest South point of 74°15'S on 23 January. A few days later, as they moved further eastward to avoid shore ice, they were met {{by the sight of}} twin volcanoes (one of them active), which were named Mount Erebus and Mount Terror, in honour of the expedition's ships.|$|E
