40|$|Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Management {{continues}} {{to remain as}} one of the most challenging task in urban development. Despite the fact that the core environmental impact is linked to the emissions of landfill gases of MSW, the production of <b>collection</b> <b>bins</b> for Temporary Storage (TS) of MSW, also makes a substantial contribution to environmental impact. This paper presents a methodology to estimate the amount of emissions produced during the production of High Density Poly Ethylene (HDPE) <b>collection</b> <b>bins.</b> The MSW <b>collection</b> <b>bins</b> required is evaluated based on bin size, population, percapita solid waste generation and collection frequency. In this paper, the number and size of MSW <b>collection</b> <b>bins,</b> bin density and catchment area for various collection frequency for Coimbatore city is designed with the environmental impact indicator-Global Warming Potential (GWP) based on the predicted waste generation for a decade (2008 - 2017). This long term predictions could be useful to waste management organizers to select sound environmental management strategies. </h 1...|$|R

5000|$|Reel mowers, {{also called}} {{cylinder}} mowers [...] (familiar as the hand-pushed or self-powered cylinder lawn mower), have a horizontally rotating cylindrical reel composed of helical blades, {{each of which}} in turn runs past a horizontal cutter-bar, producing a continuous scissor action. The bar is held at an adjustable level just above {{the ground and the}} reel runs at a speed dependent on the forward movement speed of the machine, driven by wheels running on the ground (or in self-powered applications by a motor). The cut grass may be gathered in a <b>collection</b> <b>bin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The dirt bag or <b>collection</b> <b>bin</b> in {{a central}} vacuum system is usually so large that {{emptying}} or changing {{needs to be done}} less often, perhaps a few times per year for an ordinary household. The central unit usually stays in stand-by, and is turned on by a switch on the handle of the hose. Alternately, the unit powers up when the hose is plugged into the wall inlet, when the metal hose connector makes contact with two prongs in the wall inlet and control current is transmitted through low voltage wires to the main unit.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{was to develop a}} program for the UNLV Residence Hall Recycling 2 ̆ 6 Reuse Program for Move-In and Move-Out that would collect {{unwanted}} and unneeded materials from the residents and put them to use. Move-In collected cardboard boxes for recycling while Move-Out collected usable items such as shoes, clothes, food, bedding, and school supplies for resale. In order to have a good collection turnout, a combination of advertising and resident and staff education was conducted. Letters were sent to Resident Assistants (RA’s) and Complex Coordinators and posters and other advertisements were placed in high traffic areas for both Move-In and Move-Out. For Move-In cardboard dumpsters were put into place outside next to garbage dumpsters and for Move-Out <b>collection</b> <b>bins</b> were put into place on each floor in every hall. The collection diverted a total of 8, 627. 5 pounds of material for the 1998 Move-Out Program and approximately 28 cubic yards of cardboard for the 1998 Move-In Program. Although the collection for Move-In and Move-Out was very successful some important changes need to be made to improve the program. The changes deal more with the administration and coordination of the program, instead of the program design. Some changes include having pre-determined collection schedules and responsible volunteers recruited ahead of time. Other changes include improvements of Move-Out <b>collection</b> <b>bins</b> and increasing the number of <b>collection</b> <b>bins.</b> Overall, the program was an incredible success and should be modified and continued...|$|R

5000|$|Sludge {{thickening}} using {{centrifugal force}} is amongst {{the most common}} process used. There {{are two types of}} centrifuge designed for sludge thickening and both methods depends on the same solid-liquid separation principal. The first method is [...] "solid bowl centrifuge", a horizontally-arranged helical screw that admits sludge, removes solid in a countercurrent fashion while allowing liquids to pass through. The moving shaft consists of a set of helical scrolls which push the solid waste against the flow of incoming sludge. As solid content starts to build up, it will become too heavy and then drops down to a <b>collection</b> <b>bin.</b> A video illustrates this process.|$|E
50|$|Tree {{chippers}} {{are typically}} {{made of a}} hopper with a collar, the chipper mechanism itself, and an optional <b>collection</b> <b>bin</b> for the chips. A tree limb is inserted into the hopper (the collar serving as a partial safety mechanism to keep human body parts away from the chipping blades) and started into the chipping mechanism. The chips exit through a chute and can be directed into a truck-mounted container or onto the ground. Typical output is chips {{on the order of}} 1 in to 2 in across in size. The resulting wood chips have various uses such as being spread as a ground cover or being fed into a digester during papermaking.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of dust and debris <b>collection</b> <b>bins</b> for he 500 series robots. The {{standard}} vacuum bin incorporates a squeegee vacuum. The high-capacity sweeper bin does not include a vacuum, but has greater debris capacity. The Aerovac Bin directs suction airflow through the main brushes instead of using a squeegee, which is thought to keep the brushes cleaner.|$|R

50|$|On 29 March 2004, Sharpe {{visited a}} local Bunnings Warehouse {{hardware}} store in Frankston, where he purchased {{a roll of}} duct tape, two tarpaulins, and an electric chainsaw. The following day he exhumed the body {{of his wife and}} cut it into three pieces. He then wrapped the remains in a tarpaulin and disposed of them, along with the chainsaw, in waste <b>collection</b> <b>bins</b> at the Mornington Transfer Station.|$|R
5000|$|Cyclonic and {{filtered}} {{central vacuum}} systems {{are the two}} main types of central vacuums, differentiated by the method used to separate dirt and dust from the incoming airstream. True cyclonic cleaners do not use filtration bags, instead separating the dirt and dust into a detachable cylindrical collection vessel or bin. Air and dust are sucked at high speed into the collection vessel at a direction tangential to the vessel wall, creating a fast-spinning vortex. Roughly speaking, the dust particles and other debris spiral outward {{to the wall of}} the vessel by centrifugal force, where they fall due to gravity {{into the bottom of the}} <b>collection</b> <b>bin.</b> For a more complete technical description of this process, see the article on [...] "Cyclonic separation".|$|E
50|$|Flail mowers have {{a number}} of small blades on the end of chains {{attached}} to a horizontal axis. The cutting is carried out by the ax-like heads striking the grass at speed. These types are used on rough ground, where the blades may frequently be fouled by other objects, or on tougher vegetation than grass, such as brush (scrub). Due to the length of the chains and the higher weight of the blades, they are better at cutting thick brush than other mowers, because of the relatively high inertia of the blades. In some types the cut material may be gathered in a <b>collection</b> <b>bin.</b> As a boom mower (see above), a flail mower may be used in an upright position for trimming the sides of hedges, when it is often called a hedge-cutter.|$|E
5000|$|Many free {{standing}} cigarette receptacles utilize an oxygen restricting design that extinguishes still burning butts. These style receptacles are usually made of molded plastic, polyethylene and fiberglass, with metal inner liners and metal pails to gather disposed butts. [...] Due to their oxygen depriving design, no additional extinguishing media is generally required. Cigarette butts are deposited {{through a small}} opening and drop down a long neck into the collection chamber. The collection chamber typically houses the removable pail. Other {{free standing}} receptacles, such as those made of pre-cast concrete and stone aggregate materials, rely on water, sand or gravel placed in the <b>collection</b> <b>bin</b> to assist in extinguishing disposed butts. Butt removal and clean-out is accomplished through a door in the receptacle's base, or, the base and top separate to allow access to disposed butts.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} done in the Northern Region of Ghana (Tamale metropolis) in 2012. Primary data on waste {{collection}} and management were collected at the household level (210 households) using questionnaires based on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TORA) construct. Secondary data was also collected from records of Zoom-lion Ghana Limited as well as the Tamale Municipal Waste Management Department. The TORA model was employed to evaluate how perceptions and attitudes of households influenced disposal of solid waste and willingness to pay (WTP). Overall, attitude of households had strong influence on the intention to use <b>collection</b> <b>bins</b> in future. On the other hand, social referents had no influence on the intention to use <b>collection</b> <b>bins.</b> Neither the overall attitude nor subjective norms of households had influence on their intention to use open pit as a method of solid waste disposal.

50|$|There was a {{voluntary}} take-back action for thermometers containing mercury {{based on the}} Federal Waste Management Plan 2006, and carried out in close cooperation between the Austrian Chamber of Pharmacists (Österreichische Apothekerkammer), the Federal Ministry of Environment, a private waste disposer, a producer of electronic thermometers and a pharmaceutical distributor. The disposal company supplied each pharmacy (approximately 1,200) with a <b>collection</b> <b>bin</b> and covered the cost of disposal. The pharmaceutical distributor covered the logistical costs for {{the distribution of the}} thermometers. The pharmacies accepted a refund of only 0.50 Euro per thermometer for handling (which is far below their normal margin). The supplier provided the thermometers at a reduced price. The Federal Ministry supported each sold thermometer (covering about 30% of the direct costs) and advertised the project. During the collection period, consumers could bring in a mercury thermometer and buy an electronic thermometer for a subsidised price of 1 Euro. Between October 2007 and January 2008, about 465,000 electronic thermometers were sold and about one million mercury thermometers (together containing about 1 tonne of mercury) were collected.|$|E
