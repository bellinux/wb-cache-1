40|$|This article proposes the {{adoption}} of Goffman's concept of "framing" to <b>characterize</b> <b>irony</b> across its forms; the suggestion that this framing is achieved by a shift of footing reveals links between verbal irony {{and other forms of}} talk. Examination of irony in conversation shows how the shift of footing allows for detachment, enabling the ironist to make evaluations in response to perceived transgressions with reference to common assumptions. It is both the construction of an ironic turn and its placement in a sequence that make for the discernible shift of footing, and thus the visibility of the frame; with irony, conversational expectations of what constitutes a next turn are fulfilled on the level of form, but undermined on the level of content. This analysis shows the extent to which irony is affiliative, and reveals its hitherto unacknowledged subtlety of effect and range of attitude...|$|R

5000|$|Tragic {{irony is}} a special {{category}} of dramatic irony. In tragic irony, the words and actions of the characters contradict the real situation, which the spectators fully realize. The Oxford English Dictionary defines this as:the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned, the literary device so used, orig. in Greek tragedy.

In his introduction to Fenton Johnson in The Book of American Negro Poetry, James Weldon Johnson writes that in many of Johnson’s poems, “there is nothing left to fight or even hope for.” Yet, James Weldon Johnson continues, “these poems of despair possess tremendous power and constitute Fenton Johnson’s best work.” Fenton Johnson is often seen as a poet who possesses a particularly fatalistic perspective branching from his experience as an African American, and this type of embittered poetry is what he is most known for.|$|R
40|$|Preoccupied {{with the}} anxieties of modernity, {{academic}} criticism has largely characterized Gothic fiction as a literature {{of fear and}} anxiety - yet most Gothic writing engages with the comic {{in one form or}} another. However, {{in the midst of a}} welter of 'spoofs' and 'ironic slasher movies', 'comic Gothic' has perhaps been easily dismissed as parody in its lower sense. Gothic and the Comic Turn offers a fresh perspective on Gothic fiction, arguing that the value of the comic turn in Gothic texts has been largely overlooked. Gothic writing does indeed express the fragmentation of the modern subject but this expression is <b>characterized</b> by <b>irony,</b> scepticism, and the enjoyment of comic incongruity even as it engages with anguish, fear, isolation and alienation. Tracing an historical trajectory from the late Romantic period through to the late twentieth century, this book examines how varieties of comic parody and appropriation have interrogated the complexities of modern subjectivity. Writers examined include Maria Edgeworth, Eaton Stannard Barrett, E. T. A. Hoffmann, George Meredith, George du Maurier, Djuna Barnes, Evelyn Waugh, Stella Gibbons, Barbara Comyns, Muriel Spark, Iain Banks, Patrick McGrath, Fay Weldon and Angela Carter. ...|$|R

(The {{history of}} the {{indigenous}} groups reveals a continual rivalry manifested in different forms, {{but one of the}} revealing forms of rivalry is the verbal form-- that is to say, a verbal war which is <b>characterized</b> by sarcasm, <b>irony,</b> and offense using words, at one point overcoming the tensions in the struggles of the Ngäbe and Buglé. At some moment in history they made an alliance as a defense strategy against another indigenous group, but in this fellowship each one said that they were better than the other. The Ngäbes called the Buglés bobotas or bokotas to offend them, to say that they were like toads, and the Buglés used the word gwarare, or gwa minta, which means worms. The contacts made by Latinos with the indigenous groups confirmed that the other group was called Bokotas or Guaymíes, and so the books were written. But now neither of these words designates either of the two groups.) ...|$|R
50|$|Sarcasm is <b>characterized</b> as verbal <b>irony,</b> {{which is}} when a speaker expresses an {{attitude}} toward some object, event, or person by saying {{something that is not}} literally true. It usually means the opposite of what the speaker actually says. According to Grice and his Maxims of Conversation, the speaker and listen try to be truthful and say nothing false or it will disrupt the maxim of quality (Grice 1975). The speaker is either violating the maxim of quality or they are trying to communicate a message by appearing to violate the maxim. He said that when someone says something that is opposite to the facts, listeners interpret it as the opposite. The problem with this theory is that it doesn't explain why the speaker is motivated to say the opposite of what they meant, nor does it explain the relevance of saying the opposite of what is meant. Glucksberg proposes the echoic reminder theory to explain sarcasm because it provides motivation for saying the opposite of what is meant but it also provides an explanation to the marked asymmetry of ironic statements; positive statements can be used ironically. He conducted three experiments that tested to see how sarcastic a final remark would be in a story prompt the participants were given.|$|R
40|$|A {{peculiar}} <b>irony</b> <b>characterizes</b> {{the perception}} of global terrorism—in the strong penchant to flavor it with ethno or religious centric biases or in the disavowal of any auxiliary circumstance {{leading up to the}} sporadic incidence of violence. This paper analyzes the Mumbai attacks of November 26 th, 2009 from the context of altruistic suicide/homicide. The waging of war against anonymous targets in Mumbai was by all means impersonal. It could be connected to an aftermath of several factors: Kashmir, homegrown terrorism, backlash of sectarian groups or yet another manifestation of already hostile Indo-Pak relationships. The spectacle of terror that was life telecast by national and global media led to a sequel of reactions including a follow-up of Indo-Pak mutual accusations, evoking of national sentiments and analytical ruptures in south Asian intelligentsia in making sense of the loss. This paper situates the Mumbai attacks of 26 / 11 in the theoretical discourse on sociology of terrorism by (i) providing a scholastic definition of terrorism and its corresponding attributes that distinguishes terrorism from other sporadic acts of violence, (ii) reflects on the context of terrorism with reference to altruism as in the classical Durkhiemian tradition and (iii) analytically moves beyond the classical paradigm to redefine the terror trails of 26 / 11 within the emerging definitions of altruistic-suicide-homicide. </em...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a comparative}} and interdisciplinary analysis of different modes of Holocaust representation, including French and Yiddish testimony and literature {{and an international}} array of monuments, memorials, and museums. Although setting out to write about pain I have inadvertently also written about pleasure; by examining painful memories and painful recreations, I uncover the thorny problems that pleasure poses {{in relation to the}} aesthetics of remembering the Shoah. Because aesthetics is the branch of philosophy dedicated to investigating what pleases the senses, aesthetic questions always involve pleasure. Because history is the branch of the humanities that investigates social change, it often involves pain. Hence my project addresses the paradox inherent in the aesthetics of history. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation I discuss the aesthetics of memory and their relationship to pleasure in literature by Charlotte Delbo, Georges Perec, Edmond Jabes, Robert Antelme, and Marcel Proust. I argue that some of these writers challenge prevalent conceptions of Holocaust representation and Jewish identity, hence problematizing the very subjects they memorialize. In the second part I reflect on the interconnections between language, memory, and Jewish identity within Yiddish literary and testimonial culture by analyzing Yiddish texts by Jacob Glatstein and Abraham Sutzkever. I argue that a paradoxical relationship between nostalgia and <b>irony</b> <b>characterizes</b> many of these works, and that this paradox derives from the confrontation between the pleasure of memory and the painful realization that the past is irretrievably lost. In the final part of my dissertation I discuss various arguments about Holocaust monuments and memorials in Europe and America and reveal parallels and differences between literary, sculptural, and architectural aesthetics.

40|$|There {{are many}} reasons, which can {{call of the}} smile, but only {{two of them are}} main {{categories}} - first one will be a smile, which follow out bodily contentment and the second will be smile make of irony. On the one hand, the smile can be call out contented desires. In this way the smile is found behind discourse and it has got animal form. This essay will be consider about relativity impulses {{on the far side of}} end, which make of laugh. The Author especially put pressure on the line, when the joy become the mechanism of irony and derision. He thinks, that derision is a well known subtype came from classic irony. Of course, behind irony exist others concepts, such as lie, betrayal, Aesop's language and derision. The Essay was searching the answer - How notions as irony and derision locate in front of social mechanism, inclusion and exclusion, inclusion in and exclusion out the society. In this project author is trying to prove, that derision is a linguistic mechanism, which is connected with all systems well known as totalitarian, and <b>irony</b> <b>characterize</b> all systems in the face of democratic, but liberally minded. Derision and Irony are often connect with self. The Ironic utterance mustn't contain elements of derision. On the other side, derision always meet with irony. In fact "the real derision" always contain negative element, which is destructive for her subject and which is transfer by the irony. The Irony speech attribute negative weight of sarcasm, which charge the derision. The Most important fact says, that derision is always mete out of someone or something. This is like an element which cannot be subordinate of values, which are present by "we". The Irony save the distance in her subject. The Author thinks, that irony is much more just, neutral, face feelings, than derision. The Irony does not want to make a paradoxical reaction than laugh. On the contrary, derision take side with the "society", rules, hierarchy and system. Then again, irony take side with scurrility. Irony agrees to the world without rules. Author has convinced, that's effect of apathetical alienation. Derision release society, who we have to do without them. Even more, if we mock at intolerance, we will take side with them. The Last conclusion makes an appeal, that we should use hospitable irony and we should share with her effect, called burly laugh. Miłosz Markiewic...|$|R
