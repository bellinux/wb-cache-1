5|$|Corals are shallow, colonial {{organisms that}} {{integrate}} δ18O and trace elements into their skeletal aragonite (polymorph of calcite) crystalline structures, as they grow.

5|$|DVT {{diagnosis}} {{requires the}} use of imaging devices such as ultrasound. Clinical assessments, which predict DVT likelihood, <b>can</b> <b>help</b> determine if a D-dimer test is useful. In those not highly likely to have DVT, a normal D-dimer result can rule out a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Entomopathogenic fungi infect {{and kill}} insects, {{including}} {{a variety of}} pest species, so they have been investigated as possible biological control agents. A variety of Ascomycetes, including Beauveria, Lecanicillium, Metarhizium, and Paecilomyces have promising features for use as biological insecticides. Metarhizium in particular <b>can</b> <b>help</b> to control outbreaks of locusts.|$|E

5|$|For {{antioxidant}} therapy, {{studies have}} shown that reactive oxidative species lead to the formation of multiple sclerosis lesions in which antioxidants <b>can</b> <b>help</b> induce neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects. Probably the most clear disease modifying factor (for worse) is smoking, and therefore to quit smoking should be considered.|$|E
5|$|Forensic archaeologists <b>can</b> <b>help</b> {{determine}} potential grave {{sites that}} might have been overlooked. Differences in the soil <b>can</b> <b>help</b> forensic archaeologists locate these sites. During the burial of a body, a small mound of soil will form from the filling of the grave. The loose soil and increasing nutrients from the decomposing body encourages different kinds of plant growth than surrounding areas. Typically, grave sites will have looser, darker, more organic soil than areas around it. The search for additional grave sites can be useful during the investigation of genocide and mass graves to search for additional burial locations.|$|E

Crop varieties that are resistant to pests and diseases can reduce the need for application of harmfulpesticides.While crops that are more vigorous can better compete withweeds whichreduces the need for applyingherbicides. This is shown in a case study completed atAarhus Universityin Denmark which used more robust maize.Drought resistant plants <b>can</b> <b>help</b> save water and reduce the need forirrigation whiledeeper rooting varieties <b>can</b> <b>help</b> stabilize soils; and varieties that are more efficient in their use of nutrients require lessfertilizer.|$|E
