25|$|Hello Americans, a CBS Radio series {{broadcast}} November 15, 1942 – January 31, 1943, was produced, {{directed and}} hosted by Welles {{under the auspices}} of the Office of the Coordinator for Inter-American Affairs. The 30-minute weekly program promoted inter-American understanding and friendship, drawing upon the research amassed for the ill-fated film, It's All True. The series was produced concurrently with Welles's other CBS series, <b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited</b> (November 9, 1942 – February 1, 1943), sponsored by the Lockheed-Vega Corporation. The program was conceived to glorify the aviation industry and dramatize its role in World War II. Welles's shows were regarded as significant contributions to the war effort.|$|E
25|$|In early 1943, the two {{concurrent}} {{radio series}} (<b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited,</b> Hello Americans) that Orson Welles created for CBS {{to support the}} war effort had ended. Filming also had wrapped on the 1943 film adaptation of Jane Eyre and that fee, {{in addition to the}} income from his regular guest-star roles in radio, made it possible for Welles to fulfill a lifelong dream. He approached the War Assistance League of Southern California and proposed a show that evolved into a big-top spectacle, part circus and part magic show. He offered his services as magician and director, and invested some $40,000 of his own money in an extravaganza he co-produced with his friend Joseph Cotten: The Mercury Wonder Show for Service Men. Members of the U.S. armed forces were admitted free of charge, while the general public had to pay. The show entertained more than 1,000 service members each night, and proceeds went to the War Assistance League, a charity for military service personnel.|$|E

Two research studies were conducted to evaluate human performance using new technologies. In the first study, ten participants completed the Modified Rhyme Test (MRT) {{in an effort to}} compare the intelligibility of two text-to-speech (TTS) engines (DECtalk and AT&T’s Natural Voices) as presented in 85 dB(A) aircraft cockpit engine noise. Results indicated significant differences in intelligibility (p ≤ 0. 05) between the two speech synthesizers across the tested speech-to-noise ratios (S/N) (i. e., – 5 dB,- 8 dB, and – 11 dB S/N) with the AT&T engine resulting in superior intelligibility in all of the S/N. The AT&T product was therefore selected as the TTS engine for the second study. In the second study, 16 visual flight rules (VFR) rated pilots were evaluated for their data link performance using a flight simulator (ELITE i-GATE) equipped with a mixed-modality simulated data link within one of two flight conditions. Data link modalities included textual, synthesized speech, digitized speech, and synthesized speech/textual combination. Flight conditions included VFR (<b>unlimited</b> <b>ceiling...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited</b> (later {{known as}} America — <b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited)</b> (1942-1944) is a CBS radio series created by Orson Welles and {{sponsored}} by the Lockheed-Vega Corporation. The program was conceived to glorify the aviation industry and dramatize its role in World War II.|$|E
5000|$|Such {{were the}} {{differences}} {{from the first}} season format that Old Time Radio enthusiast website The Digital Deli argues, [...] "Any attempt to simply conflate <b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited</b> and America, <b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited</b> is just silly. They're entirely different formats … The only elements common to both programs were their sponsor and the phrase, Ceiling Unlimited".|$|E
5000|$|Welles {{titled the}} series <b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited.</b> [...] "He thought it both romantic and evocative," [...] wrote biographer Frank Brady, [...] "but the {{sponsors}} disagreed. For weeks, in publicity releases and other references {{the program was}} called 'the new Orson Welles Show,' and it wasn't until {{two days before the}} broadcast, when it appeared that Orson would not relent, that <b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited</b> became official." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited</b> {{began as}} a 15-minute drama series {{broadcast}} Mondays at 7:15 p.m. ET. The program changed format for its second season, becoming a half-hour variety show hosted by Joseph Cotten. Retitled America — <b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited,</b> the program featured vocalists Nan Wynn and Constance Moore, and music by Wilbur Hatch. The show aired Sundays at 2 p.m. ET beginning August 8, 1943, and ending April 30, 1944.|$|E
5000|$|From June 28 through August 2, 1943, <b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited</b> was {{hosted by}} author James Hilton. [...] Reviewing a July broadcast, Billboard wrote, [...] "Hilton's ceiling is zero-zero … Like many other ideas, James Hilton as a radio program {{sounded like a}} million dollars on paper and a thin dime on the air."

50|$|In 1942-43 Orson Welles created two CBS Radio {{series that}} are {{regarded}} as significant contributions to the war effort.

5000|$|<b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited</b> began November 9, 1942. Each week, {{announcer}} Pat McGeehan repeated, [...] "Man {{has always}} {{looked to the}} heavens for help and inspiration, and from the skies too will come his victory and his future." [...] Welles cast many of his Mercury Theatre company of actors, including Ray Collins, Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead and Everett Sloane. Bernard Herrmann created the music for the first 13 shows.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with other}} Mercury Theatre players, Collins made his feature film debut in Citizen Kane (1941), {{in which he}} portrayed {{ruthless}} political boss Jim W. Gettys. He appeared in Welles's original Broadway production of Native Son (1941) and also played a principal role in Welles's second film, The Magnificent Ambersons (1942). His ongoing radio work included Welles's wartime series, <b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited</b> and Hello Americans (1942), and the variety show, The Orson Welles Almanac (1944).|$|E
5000|$|Herrmann {{also created}} {{the music for}} Welles's CBS radio series the Orson Welles Show (1941-1942), which {{included}} the debut of his wife Lucille Fletcher's suspense classic, The Hitch-Hiker; <b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited</b> (1942), a program conceived to glorify the aviation industry and dramatize its role in World War II; and The Mercury Summer Theatre on the Air (1946). [...] "Benny Herrmann was an intimate member of the family," [...] Welles told filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited</b> was a morale-boosting {{anthology}} {{of stories about}} heroic tales of aviation. Described by radio historian John Dunning as [...] "aggressively patriotic," [...] the program {{was sponsored by the}} Lockheed-Vega Corporation. There were no commercial breaks; the company was content to have just three one-line mentions throughout each show. It was noted in the contemporary press that as Lockheed and Vega had only one lucrative customer — the wartime Allied governments — they did not need to advertise.|$|E
5000|$|Welles left <b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited</b> {{at the end}} of his 13-episode contract, {{concluding}} {{the broadcast}} on February 1, 1943, with a statement: [...] "For a while, the Mercury Theatre is going off the air. Next week my friend Ronald Colman will tell you the story about the Douglas Dauntless, the world's greatest dive bomber. We very much wish it were possible to go on writing and producing these radio plays. We've never been happier. … We leave with real regret." ...|$|E
5000|$|Orson Welles {{returned}} to the United States August 22, 1942, {{after six months of}} filming in Latin America {{at the behest of the}} Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and serving as what Welles termed [...] "a kind of Ambassador extraordinary." [...] Within weeks he began to plan two CBS radio dramas to be broadcast on consecutive nights: <b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited,</b> and Hello Americans, a docudrama to promote inter-American understanding and friendship during World War II.|$|E
5000|$|Welles's run on {{the program}} {{overlapped}} with his other CBS radio series, Hello Americans, which was broadcast on Sunday nights while <b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited</b> aired on Monday nights. His radio success was [...] "a psychic exhilarant" [...] for Welles, wrote biographer Frank Brady: [...] "After the difficulties of It's All True and the discredit of Ambersons, compounded by the humiliation of being turned away by RKO, he began to regain his confidence with the positive radio reviews that appeared across the nation." ...|$|E
5000|$|Beginning Sunday, August 8, 1943, Joseph Cotten {{hosted the}} 30-minute variety series still {{sponsored}} by Lockheed and Vega but now titled America — <b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited.</b> In his 1987 autobiography, Cotten recalled {{that at the}} end of the first broadcast he was summoned to the control booth for a telephone call: [...] "It was Groucho Marx. He congratulated me and said that he had not only enjoyed the show, but had also been completely sold by the commercial. 'Just where can I buy a P-38?' he asked." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Ceiling Unlimited {{demonstrated}} Welles's talent {{when taken}} to extremes," [...] summarized biographer Bret Wood. [...] "Fifteen minutes was hardly {{enough time to}} accomplish the different goals set forth, but {{he did his best}} to cover the spectrum of emotions and topics, sometimes to great effect but more often with campy results. The context in which the program was originally heard can never be recreated, so <b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited</b> is impossible to objectively assess. Its sister program Hello Americans is less dated and for various reasons is superior to its less subdued counterpart." ...|$|E
5000|$|After joining CBS in 1933, Garde {{began to}} work {{extensively}} in radio, performing on some three dozen shows including Lorenzo Jones, Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch, The Big Story, The Eddie Cantor Show (on which she played [...] "all the women roles"), Front Page Farrell, Maudie's Diary, Perry Mason, Theatre Guild on the Air and The Fat Man. In 1934 Garde worked with Orson Welles on the CBS Radio series The American School of the Air, and she later performed in Welles radio series including Les Misérables, The Mercury Theatre on the Air, The Campbell Playhouse and <b>Ceiling</b> <b>Unlimited.</b>|$|E

Welles presented the story once more, to conclude the final episode of his CBS radio series, The Orson Welles Almanac, broadcast July 19, 1944.|$|E
