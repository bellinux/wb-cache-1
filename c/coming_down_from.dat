5|$|Marcello Malpighi, {{the father}} of microscopical anatomy, {{discovered}} that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm. He observed that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the leaves, and being captured above the ring.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} site of Ty Dwr the railway bends around 'Amen' corner and soon after the Village Incline is reached. From here the line runs into the gorge, high above the river on a narrow ledge, ending {{at the foot of}} the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The {{original}} line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend. Nant Gwernol station, the eastern terminus of the line, was built on {{the site of}} the sidings.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with these}} constraints, the Spanish {{expedition}} {{had to cross}} the river several times and fight at each ford against stiff opposition. The bulk of the Inca army confronted the Spaniards from a set of terraces overlooking a plain by the Urubamba River. Several Spanish assaults against the terraces failed against a shower of arrows, slingshots and boulders <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the terraces {{as well as from}} both flanks. To hinder the efforts of the Spanish cavalry the Incas flooded the plain using previously prepared channels; water eventually reached the horses' girths. The defenders then counterattacked; some of them used Spanish weapons captured in previous encounters such as swords, bucklers, armor and even a horse, ridden by Manco Inca himself. In a severely compromised situation, Hernando Pizarro ordered a retreat; under the cover of darkness the Spanish force fled through the Urubamba valley with the Incas in pursuit and reached Cusco the next day.|$|E

5|$|When the Department of Engineering {{laid out}} the initial state highway system after the state's voters {{approved}} a bond issue {{to pay for it}} in 1910, they included Route5, connecting Santa Cruz and Oakland with Stockton via Altamont Pass. San Joaquin County paved the portion near Tracy with asphalt with their own bond issue, passed in 1909, and the state later resurfaced it with concrete. In addition, the new concrete road bypassed Banta, which the old county road had passed through via Banta Road, F Street, and Grant Line Road. Otherwise, the road was relatively direct, <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> Altamont Pass onto Grant Line Road, following Byron Highway into Tracy, and leaving east and northeasterly on 11th Street to the San Joaquin River at the Mossdale Crossing. The Lincoln Highway Association chose this route in 1913 for their transcontinental highway, where it remained until the Carquinez Bridge opened in 1927, creating a shorter route via Vallejo. In 1926, the American Association of State Highway Officials designated the Stockton-Bay Area route as US48, which was absorbed by an extension of US50 by the early 1930s.|$|E

25|$|The valley's {{climate is}} varied. The eastern part near the Andes is cooler than {{the western side}} due to the breezes <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the mountains, {{and most of the}} biggest {{producers}} are located in this area of Curicó and in Molina. At the western end, the coastal range protects the valley from the ocean influence.|$|E

25|$|While <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> New Brunswick and off {{the coast}} of Lubec, Maine, Blyth sighted and {{captured}} a small sailing craft crewed by a group of women out for a sail. He brought the women aboard and politely suggested that in the future they sail closer to the shore; he then released them. One of the women was married to the local militia commander who, impressed with Blyth’s courtesy, placed advertisements in local newspapers praising his chivalry.|$|E

25|$|Spain had {{maintained}} {{a number of}} missions and presidios in New Spain since 1519. The Crown laid claim to the north coastal provinces of California in 1542. Excluding Santa Fe in New Mexico, settlement of northern New Spain was slow for the next 155 years. Settlements in Loreto, Baja California Sur, were established in 1697, {{but it was not}} until the threat of incursion by Russian fur traders and potentially settlers, <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> Alaska in 1765, that Spain, under King Charles III, felt development of more northern installations was necessary.|$|E
25|$|In 1914, a {{downtown}} redevelopment plan based on City Beautiful movement principles {{led to the}} construction of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad's (D) new headquarters, today the State University of New York (SUNY) System Administration Building. The Flemish Gothic edifice by local architect Marcus T. Reynolds, closely copied from the Cloth Hall in Ypres, Belgium, {{was meant to be a}} focal point for traffic <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> Capitol Hill to the west via State Street. To further this goal, the industrial structures along the riverfront behind it were demolished.|$|E
25|$|Kingfishers {{have been}} seen just {{downstream}} and the estate's woodland policies and river contain, amongst others, tawny and barn owls, herons, mallard, ravens, rooks, treecreepers, buzzards, peewits or lapwings, roe deer, mink, moles, shrews, grey squirrels, hares, hedgehogs, foxes, badgers, pipistrelle bats and probably otters. Migrating Canada and greylag geese frequent the nearby fields on their way up from the Caerlaverock or <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> Spitzbergen in the winter. Duncan McNaught in 1895 records that he found a kingfisher's nest at an arms length inside an earthen burrow at Chapelton on the Annick.|$|E

25|$|Two {{aspartate}} {{amino acid}} residues (below left) are interacting with two adjacent water molecules (w6 and w8) in the Mn2+ isocitrate porcine IDH complex to deprotonate the alcohol off the alpha-carbon atom. The oxidation of the alpha-C also {{takes place in}} this picture where NAD+ accepts a hydride resulting in oxalosuccinate. Along with the sp3 to sp2 stereochemical change around the alpha-C, there is a ketone group that is formed form the alcohol group. The formation of this ketone double bond allows for resonance to take place as electrons <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the leaving carboxylate group move towards the ketone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> Whyalla in 1966 to play juniors, {{he began}} his League career in 1967 and was runner-up in both the Magarey Medal and co-winner of North's best and fairest with Don Lindner, as well as {{representing}} South Australia. Robran was instrumental in North Adelaide's premiership sides in 1971 and 1972, {{as well as their}} Australian Championship win over VFL premier, Carlton in 1972. From 1968 to 1973, he was best and fairest at North, but making the move to the VFL never interested him; a quiet country boy, he never aspired to a life in Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|The second box is Step 1, {{which is}} the {{oxidation}} of the alpha-C (C#2). Oxidation {{is the first step}} that isocitrate goes through. In this process, the alcohol group off the alpha-carbon (C#2) is deprotonated and the electrons flow to the alpha-C forming a ketone group and removing a hydride off C#2 using NAD+/NADP+ as an electron accepting cofactor. The oxidation of the alpha-C allows for a position where electrons (in the next step) will be <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the carboxyl group and pushing the electrons (making the double bonded oxygen) back up on the oxygen or grabbing a nearby proton off a nearby Lysine amino acid.|$|E
