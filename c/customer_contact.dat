40|$|Abstract. Activity data {{accumulated}} in real life, e. g. in terrorist activities and fraudulent <b>customer</b> <b>contacts,</b> presents special structural and semantic complexities. However, it {{may lead to}} or be associated with significant business impacts. For instance, a series of terrorist activities may trigger a disaster to the society, large amounts of fraudulent activities in social security program may result in huge government customer debt. Mining such data challenges the existing KDD research in aspects such as unbalanced data distribution and impact-targeted pattern mining. This paper investigates the characteristics and challenges of activity data, and the methodologies and tasks of activity mining. Activity mining aims to discover impact-targeted activity patterns in huge volumes of unbalanced activity transactions. Activity patterns identified can prevent disastrous events or improve business decision making and processes. We illustrate issues and prospects in mining governmental <b>customer</b> <b>contacts...</b>|$|R

A trunk main discolouration incident highlighting this risk is discussed, demonstrating the need for pro-active trunk main risk assessments. To identify the source of the material event flow rates were modelled using the PODDS (prediction of discolouration in distribution systems) discolouration model. Best practice pro-active management is demonstrated in a case study where the PODDS model is used to implement managed incremental flow changes on a main with known discolouration risk with no discolouration impact to customers and significant cost savings...|$|R
