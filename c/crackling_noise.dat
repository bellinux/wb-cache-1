500|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema vary based on the cause, but it {{is often associated with}} swelling of the neck and chest pain, and may also involve sore throat, neck pain, difficulty swallowing, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Chest X-rays may show air in the mediastinum, the middle of the chest cavity. A significant case of subcutaneous emphysema is easy to detect by touching the overlying skin; it feels like tissue paper or Rice Krispies. [...] Touching the bubbles causes them to move and sometimes make a <b>crackling</b> <b>noise.</b> [...] The air bubbles, which are painless and feel like small nodules to the touch, may burst when the skin above them is palpated. [...] The tissues surrounding SCE are usually swollen. [...] When large amounts of air leak into the tissues, the face can swell considerably. [...] In cases of subcutaneous emphysema around the neck, there may be a feeling of fullness in the neck, {{and the sound of the}} voice may change. If SCE is particularly extreme around the neck and chest, the swelling can interfere with breathing. The air can travel to many parts of the body, including the abdomen and limbs, because there are no separations in the fatty tissue in the skin to prevent the air from moving.|$|E
2500|$|The main symptom is pain, causing loss {{of ability}} and often stiffness. [...] "Pain" [...] is {{generally}} described as a sharp ache or a burning sensation in the associated muscles and tendons, and is typically made worse by prolonged activity and relieved by rest. Stiffness is most common in the morning, and typically lasts less than thirty minutes after beginning daily activities, but may return after periods of inactivity. Osteoarthritis can cause a <b>crackling</b> <b>noise</b> (called [...] "crepitus") when the affected joint is moved or touched and people may experience muscle spasms and contractions in the tendons. Occasionally, the joints may also be filled with fluid. Some people report increased pain associated with cold temperature, high humidity, or a drop in barometric pressure, but studies have had mixed results.|$|E

2500|$|Variable {{resistors}} {{can also}} degrade {{in a different}} manner, typically involving poor contact between the wiper and {{the body of the}} resistance. This may be due to dirt or corrosion and is typically perceived as [...] "crackling" [...] as the contact resistance fluctuates; this is especially noticed as the device is adjusted. This is similar to crackling caused by poor contact in switches, and like switches, potentiometers are to some extent self-cleaning: running the wiper across the resistance may improve the contact. Potentiometers which are seldom adjusted, especially in dirty or harsh environments, are most likely to develop this problem. When self-cleaning of the contact is insufficient, improvement can usually be obtained through the use of contact cleaner (also known as [...] "tuner cleaner") spray. The <b>crackling</b> <b>noise</b> associated with turning the shaft of a dirty potentiometer in an audio circuit (such as the volume control) is greatly accentuated when an undesired DC voltage is present, often indicating the failure of a DC blocking capacitor in the circuit.|$|E

In Paris, news of Bell's test quickly drew crowds of onlookers who witnessed Melville's voice emanating from the crude metal box.

40|$|GE and the USN {{continue}} {{to work together to}} find and develop practical techniques to reduce jet noise on tactical aircraft such as the F/A- 18 E/F/G. Noise is an important issue for the Navy because of the harsh acoustic environment induced during operations of these aircraft on aircraft carriers and the impact to communities around Naval Air Bases and training sites. The noise generated by these systems is predominantly the noise generated by the exhaust plume due to the low bypass ratio of the engine and very high exhaust jet velocities. The main components of this jet noise are the jet mixing, shock and <b>crackle</b> <b>noise.</b> The present paper reports on progress, following Reference [1] with the F/A- 18 E/F/G jet noise reduction program, which is currently focused on the USN near term goal of up to 3 dB reduction in the peak directivity direction. This goal also includes the reduction of the shock and <b>crackle</b> <b>noise</b> components. These goals are currently being pursued with nozzle plume mixing enhancement employing mechanical chevrons. These chevrons can be incorporated in the production version as a redesign of the F 414 nozzle seals and do not involve the introduction of additional parts to the nozzle. This paper focuses on the effect of chevrons on the <b>crackle</b> <b>noise</b> component both in full scale on the F 404 engine, and in small scale on the F 414 engine nozzle in the twin configuration. The paper aims {{to make the case that}} this effect, which was first observed during ground engine testing of prototype chevrons, is a beneficial one in reducing/eliminating crackle which continues to be prevalent in high performance tactical aircraft engines today...|$|R

The main objective of this work is to find optimal features and classification accuracy that yield best classification accuracy. Several types of features, including MFCC, LPCC and spectral characteristics were put under examination. The best suprasegmental features were identified by using mRMR algorithm. Several classifiers were tested as well. The results suggested that the classification of transmission channel can be performed with high accuracy (around 90 %). Influence of adverse effects, which can occur during transmission, is also examined.

From the mathematical point of view, STS is interesting because it bridges the two major parts of mathematical physics - the dynamical systems theory and topological field theories. Besides these and related disciplines such as algebraic topology and supersymmetric field theories, STS is also connected with the traditional theory of stochastic differential equations and the theory of pseudo-Hermitian operators.|$|R
