Blood and bone marrow (which contains stem cells) seep out of the fractures, creating a blood clot that releases cartilage-building cells.

The procedure is less effective in treating older patients, overweight patients, or a <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesion</b> larger than 2.5 cm.

5000|$|Marrow {{nucleated}} {{cells are}} used {{every day in}} regenerative orthopedics. The knee microfracture surgery technique popularized by Steadman relies on the release of these cells into a <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesion</b> to initiate fibrocartilage repair in osteochondral defects. [...] In addition, this cell population {{has also been shown}} to assist in the repair of non-union fractures. [...] For this application, bed side centrifugation is commonly used. Again, these techniques produce a very dilute MSC population, usually a yield of 1 in 10,000-1,000,000 of the nucleated cells. [...] Despite this low number of MSC’s, isolated bone marrow nucleated cells implanted into degenerated human peripheral joints have shown some promise for joint repair. [...] As the number of MSC’s that can be isolated from bone marrow is fairly limited, most research in cartilage regeneration has focused on the use of culture expanded cells. [...] This method can expand cell numbers by 100-10,000 fold over several weeks. Once these MSCs are ready for re-implanation, they are usually transferred with growth factors to allow for continued cell growth and engraftment to the damaged tissue. At some point, a signal is introduced (either in culture or after transplant to the damaged tissue) for the cells to differentiate into the end tissue (in this discussion, cartilage).|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} articular <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome and to assess the diagnostic effectiveness of magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography in detecting such cartilage abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR arthrographic images obtained in 52 consecutive patients (mean age, 45. 8 years; age range, 17 - 73 years; 26 male and 26 female patients) were retrospectively evaluated for glenohumeral <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions.</b> Two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists who were blinded to the arthroscopy report independently analyzed the articular cartilage. Humeral and glenoidal cartilage were assessed separately. The lesions were graded as either subtle or marked. Arthroscopic findings were the standard of reference. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and interobserver agreement were calculated. RESULTS: At arthroscopy, humeral <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> were found in 15 patients (frequency, 29 %). Four lesions were subtle, and 11 were marked. <b>Cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> of the glenoid were less frequent (eight patients; frequency, 15 %) : Three were subtle, and five were marked. For reader 1 and reader 2, respectively, sensitivity of MR arthrography for humeral <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> was 53 % and 100 %, specificity was 87 % and 51 %, and accuracy was 77 % and 65 %; sensitivity for glenoidal <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> was 75 % and 75 %, specificity was 66 % and 63 %, and accuracy was 67 % and 65 %. Interobserver agreement for the grading of <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> with MR arthrography was fair (humeral lesions, kappa = 0. 20; glenoidal lesions, kappa = 0. 27). CONCLUSION: Glenohumeral <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> are found in up to one third of patients referred for MR arthrography for subacromial impingement syndrome.

The lack of <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> found in the adolescents is in accordance with a previous MRI study of adolescent soccer players, in which no <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> were found (Soder et al. 2011). Major et al. found that 41 % of 34 knees of varsity college basketball players showed cartilage abnormalities (Major and Helms 2002), and Kaplan et al. found that 47.5 % of 40 knees of professional basketball players had <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> (Kaplan et al. 2005), both lower rates than those found in our study.

Even at retrospective analysis, focal or diffuse abnormalities in the linear signal were found in only 10 of the 20 <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions.</b> Most of these had high-grade <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> diagnosed on conventional MR sequences. In ten <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions,</b> no abnormality in the UTE morphology of the osteochondral junction could be found. Of note, seven of these ten were apparent high-grade <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> on conventional MR sequences. This finding may suggest that these lesions were rather low-grade defects and overestimated on conventional MR images. Larger studies with arthroscopic correlation are needed to explore how the normal UTE signal pattern changes with disease and injury.|$|R

Of the 4, 849 primary ACL surgery cases in the Norwegian National Knee Ligament Registry as of 12 December 2007, 30 patients met the following inclusion criteria: a full-thickness <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesion</b> (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grades 3 and 4), age less than 40 years, no associated pathology or meniscus injury, and less than 1 year between knee injury and ACL reconstruction. Each of the 30 patients in this study group was matched with two control participants without cartilage lesions. Preoperatively, the patients completed the KOOS, and the surgeon recorded the location and size of the <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesion</b> and graded the cartilage injury according to ICRS standards. There were no significant differences between the case and control groups for any of the five subscales of the KOOS. A <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesion</b> was located in the medial compartment in 67 % of the cases, in the lateral compartment in 20 % of the cases, and in the patellofemoral joint in 13 % of the cases.

DesignEighty five subjects were classified as controls (n =  55, Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) 0, 1) or having mild–moderate ROA (n =  30, KL 2, 3). T 2 weighted MRI images at 3 -T were graded for presence of <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions,</b> labral tears, BMELs and subchondral cysts. Posterior wall sign, cross-over sign, center-edge angle and alpha angle were also recorded. Function was assessed using Hip dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), Timed-Up and Go (TUG) test and Y-Balance Test (YBT). Analysis compared function between subjects with and without ROA and those with and without femoral or acetabular <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions,</b> adjusted for age. Non-parametric correlations {{were used to assess}} the relationship between radiographic scores, MRI scores and function. ResultsSubjects with acetabular <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> had worse HOOS (Difference =  5 – 10 %, P =  0. 036 – 0. 004), but not TUG or YBT, scores.

Design 99 mTc-DPD-SPECT/CT and MRI of 27 knees of 25 patients with chronic knee pain and risk factors for osteoarthritis (OA) were evaluated by one nuclear physician and one radiologist. Six regions of the knee (in total 162 regions in 27 knees) were assessed according to structural joint lesions graded with a modified Whole Organ MR imaging score (WORMS) and according to subchondral 99 mTc-DPD-SPECT uptake. Relationships between regional WORMS scores and uptake were quantified using general estimating equations. In a secondary analysis the uptake sum with the WORMS sum per joint was compared using Spearman correlations. ResultsElevated subchondral uptake was significantly associated with the grade of <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> (P <  0. 0001). Mean uptake was significantly higher subjacent to full thickness <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> compared to partial thickness lesions (P <  0. 0001). A similar association was observed between bone marrow edema pattern (BMEP) and <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions.</b> The sum of uptakes per joint was positively correlated to the WORMS sum (rs =  0. 42) and to the sum of <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> per joint (rs =  0. 50). ConclusionBoth functional and structural changes of the subchondral bone in terms of scintigraphic osseous activity and the presence and degree of BMEP were significantly associated with <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> in patients with OA of the knee.

In this thesis, we focus on building mathematical models to investigate the biological mechanism involving chondrocyte death and inflammatory responses in the process of cartilage degeneration. Chapter 1 describes the structure of articular cartilage, the process of carti- lage degeneration, and reviews of existing mathematical models. Chapter 2 presents a delay-diffusion-reaction model of <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesion</b> formation under cyclic loading.

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{more common}} in the knee {{compared}} to the ankle joint. This can not be explained exclusively by anatomical and biomechanical differences. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze and compare the injury pattern (clinically) and the <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> (arthroscopically) of knee and ankle joints in a cohort of patients from the same catchment area. A retrospective study of the clinical data of 3122 patients (2139 outpatients and 983 inpatients) was performed, who were treated due to an injury of the knee and ankle joint. Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat 3. 0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, USA). There is a higher prevalence of injuries in the ankle as compared to the knee joint in this population from the same catchment area. In contrast, high-grade <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> are more prevalent in the knee, whereas low grade <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> are equally distributed between knee and ankle. From this data it can be concluded that the frequency of injuries and the injury pattern of knee versus ankle joints do not correlate with the severity of <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> and may therefore have no direct influence on the differential incidence of OA in those two joints...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Complex <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> of {{the knee}} {{including}} large <b>cartilage</b> defects, kissing <b>lesions,</b> and osteoarthritis (OA) represent a common problem in orthopaedic surgery and a challenging task for the orthopaedic surgeon. As there is only limited data, we performed a prospective clinical study to investigate the benefit of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) for this demanding patient population. METHODS: Fifty-one patients displaying {{at least one of}} the criteria were included in the present retrospective study: (1.) defect size larger than 10 cm 2; (2.) multiple lesions; (3.) kissing <b>lesions,</b> <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> Outerbridge grade III-IV, and/or (4.) mild/moderate osteoarthritis (OA). For outcome measurements, the International Cartilage Society's International Knee Documentation Committee's (IKDC) questionnaire, as well as the Cincinnati, Tegner, Lysholm and Noyes scores were used. Radiographic evaluation for OA was done using the Kellgren score. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Patient's age was 36 years (13 - 61), defects size 7. 25 (3 - 17. 5) cm 2, previous surgical procedures 1. 94 (0 - 8), and follow-up 30 (12 - 63) months. Instruments for outcome measurement indicated significant improvement in activity, working ability, and sports. Mean ICRS grade improved from 3. 8 preoperatively to grade 3 postoperatively, Tegner grade 1. 4 enhanced to grade 3. 39. The Cincinnati score enhanced from 25. 65 to 66. 33, the Lysholm score from 33. 26 to 64. 68, the Larson score from 43. 59 to 79. 31, and Noyes score from 12. 5 to 46. 67, representing an improvement from Cincinnati grade 3. 65 to grade 2. 1. Lysholm grade 4 improved to grade 3. 33, and Larson grade 3. 96 to 2. 78 (Table 1), (p < 0. 001). Patients with kissing <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> had similar results as patients with single <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions.</b> CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ACI provides mid-term results in patients with complex <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> {{of the knee}}. If long term results will confirm our findings, ACI may be a considered as a valuable tool for the treatment of complex <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> of the knee...|$|R
30|$|MRA {{reports of}} 41 hips with {{symptomatic}} FAI were reviewed and compared with subsequent intraoperative findings (n =  21 surgical dislocations and n =  20 therapeutic hip arthroscopies). Each case was assessed {{for the presence}} of a cam deformity, a <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesion</b> of the femoral head, an os acetabuli, an injury to the labrum and injury to the acetabular cartilage. Results were collected prospectively in a cross-table and analysed retrospectively for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV).|$|E
30|$|The {{mean age}} of the {{patients}} was 40.8 (± 5.2) years and the mean duration of the symptoms on presentation was 16 (± 4.3) months. On the initial MRI studies mean defect area was measured 3.7  cm 2 (± 0.9) which was compatible with arthroscopic findings. One patient had an accompanying degenerative medial meniscus tear. Three of the patients had osteochondritis dissecans as the etiology and the other cases were idiopathic. None of the patients had a prior surgery related to the articular <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesion.</b>|$|E
30|$|Application of chondroreparative and chondroregenerative {{factors to}} sites of {{cartilage}} damage {{is an attractive}} approach {{to improve the quality}} of the healing response of cartilage to injury. Yet, a direct administration of recombinant molecules is impeded by their relatively short pharmacological half-lives (some minutes) due to the rapid clearance from the host. Approaches based on the transfer of genetic coding sequences have the advantage of allowing for the sustained production of a candidate agent in a desired location like in a <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesion</b> (Cucchiarini & Madry 2005).|$|E

30|$|Articular {{cartilage}} {{within the}} knee provides a smooth gliding surface that protects subchondral bone by distributing pressures {{with a low}} frictional coefficient (Buckwalter 2002). Considering the articular cartilage heals poorly and may potentially lead to osteoarthritis at a younger age, {{it is critical to}} provide options within surgery to prevent lesion propagation or to repair the cartilage. Previous retrospective studies of knee arthroscopies demonstrate common incidence of <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> (Årøen et al. 2004; Curl et al. 1997; Hjelle et al. 2002; Widuchowski et al. 2007). During knee arthroscopy, partial thickness articular <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> are commonly encountered, with up to 11 % of all knee arthroscopies may be suitable for repair (Årøen et al. 2004). The incidence of treatable defects may be even higher in the athletic population (Flanigan et al. 2010). Though the natural history of cartilage defects is not fully understood, <b>cartilage</b> <b>lesions</b> can lead to degenerative joint disease and are frequently seen with osteoarthritis (Christoforakis et al. 2005).|$|R
