50|$|Truss Bridge #155 is a {{camelback}} truss bridge, 160 {{feet long}} and dividedinto eight panels, with the two trusses joined by a system of portal,lateral, and sway braces. The truss system ispin-joined. The trusses have die-punched eyes on the bottom chords butalso forge-welded double <b>clevises</b> on all tie bars. The bridge is supported by coarse stone (north side) and concrete piers, with a macadam covered plank road surface. The remains of theearthen base and timber support for the central pier of an earlierbridge may be seen below the bridge.|$|E
50|$|A pin shackle {{is closed}} with an anchor bolt and cotter pin, {{in a manner}} similar to a clevis. It is for this reason they are often {{referred}} to, in industrial jargon, as <b>clevises.</b> Pin shackles can be inconvenient to work with, at times, as the bolt will need to be secured to the shackle body to avoid its loss, usually with a split pin or seizing wire. A more secure version used in crane rigging features the combination of a securing nut (hardware) located alongside the cotter pin. Pin shackles are practical in many rigging applications where the anchor bolt is expected to experience some rotation.|$|E
5000|$|When finally completed, the [...] chain {{contained}} huge iron links, each {{two feet}} in length and weighing 114 lb. The links were carted to New Windsor, where they were put together, and floated down the river to West Point on logs late in April. Including swivels, <b>clevises,</b> and anchors, the chain weighed 65 tons. For buoyancy, 40 ft logs were cut into 16 ft sections, waterproofed, and joined by fours into rafts fastened with 12 ft timbers. Short sections of chain (10 links, a swivel, and a clevis) were stapled across each raft and later, in the river, the chain sections were united. Peter Townsend, owner of Sterling Iron Works, was paid by the Continental Congress to manufacture the chain.Captain Thomas Machin, the Artillery Officer and engineer who had installed the chain at Fort Montgomery, {{was assigned to the}} same task at West Point. On 30 April 1778, he directed the installation of the chain across the river. Its southern end was secured to a small cove on the West Bank of the river and its northern end was anchored to Constitution Island. The West Point side was protected by Chain Battery and the Constitution Island side by Marine Battery. Both ends were anchored to log cribs filled with rocks.|$|E

40|$|Current {{options for}} Lunar habitat {{architecture}} include inflatable habitats and airlocks. Inflatable structures can have mass and volume advantages over conventional structures. Inflatable structures {{are perceived to}} carry additional risk because they are at a lower Technical Readiness Level (TRL) than conventional metallic structures. One of {{the risks associated with}} inflatable structures is understanding the tolerance to component damage and the resulting behavior of the system after the damage is introduced. The Damage Tolerance Test (DTT) is designed to study the structural integrity of an expandable structure during and subsequent to induced damage. The TransHab Project developed an experimental inflatable module developed at Johnson Space Center in the 1990 's. The TransHab design was originally envisioned for use in Mars Transits but was also studied as a potential habitat for the International Space Station (ISS). The design of the TransHab module was based on a woven design using an Aramid fabric. Testing of this design demonstrated a high level of predictability and repeatability and good correlation with analytical predictions of stresses and deflections. Based on JSC's experience with the design and analysis of woven inflatable structures, the Damage Tolerance Test article was designed and fabricated using a woven design. The Damage Tolerance Test Article consists of a load bearing restraint layer, a bladder or gas barrier, and a structural metallic core. The test article restraint layer is fabricated from one inch wide Kevlar webbing that is woven in a basket weave pattern. Underneath the structural restraint layer is the bladder or gas barrier. For this test the bladder was required to maintain pressure for testing only and was not representative of a flight design. The bladder and structural restraint layer attach to the structural core of the module at steel bulkheads at each end. The two bulkheads are separated by a 10 foot center tube which provides the structural support for the module when in a non-inflated state as well as resists a portion of the axial load when pressurized. The longitudinal members of the structural restraint layer are attached to the bulkheads using a series of <b>clevises</b> that are bolted to the bulkheads. Strain gages are placed on the <b>clevises</b> that can measure change in load when the structural restraint is inflated. The test module is 88 inches in diameter and 120 inches in height. The objectives of the DTT are to (1) verify the structural integrity of the assembled and pressurized structure when a section of the structural restraint layer is cut by a foreign object, and (2) verify the load distribution of the structural restraint layer during pressurization, before and after the structural restraint layer is severed. For this test, a longitudinal structural restraint strap will be severed using a linear shape charge. The linear shape charge was designed specifically for this application to cut only a single longitudinal strap, while not damaging the bladder. An array of strain gages were located at the bulkhead mounted <b>clevises</b> where the longitudinal restraint layer straps are attached. The DTT article was inflated to 45 psig, 25 % of the ultimate design pressure, and one of the one-inch wide longitudinal structural members was severed. Strain gage measurements of loading in an array of longitudinal straps were taken throughout pressurization of the module to 45 psig, before firing of the linear shape charge, and after firing of the shape charge and separation of the strap. During testing not only were the original objectives met but better than expected results occurred. This paper will discuss space inflatable structures, damage tolerance analysis, test results, and applicability to the Lunar architecture...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{calculations}} contained in the attached appendix {{is to determine the}} vibrational stability of the following combination (The Combination); shipping container, strongback and trailer. The vibrational stability of The Combination will be determined with the shipping container and strongback in the upright position. If the natural frequency of The Combination coincides with the input frequency and no damping is present, resonance will occur. The result of this is that the natural frequency of the Combination must be calculated as well as the input frequency. The input frequency in this case is caused by wind. Due to their geometrical complexity the upper and lower hydraulic <b>clevises</b> were analyzed for structural adequacy by using finite-element analysis (FEA). The FEA software COSMOS/M version 1. 70 was used to model the upper and lower hydraulic clevis. All designs are in accordance with Standard Architectural-Civil Design Criteria, Design Loads for Facilities (DOE-RL 1989) and are safety class 3. The design and fabrication of each component is in accordance with American Institute of Steel Construction, Manual of Steel Construction, (AISC, 1989).

40|$|Figure 1 shows a {{prototype}} of a large pressure vessel under development for eventual use as a habitable module for long spaceflight (e. g., for transporting humans to Mars). The vessel is a hybrid that comprises an inflatable shell attached to a rigid central structural core. The inflatable shell is, itself, a hybrid that comprises (1) a pressure bladder restrained against expansion by (2) a web of straps made from high-strength polymeric fabrics. On Earth, pressure vessels like this could be used, for example, as portable habitats that could be set up quickly in remote locations, portable hyperbaric chambers for treatment of decompression sickness, or flotation devices for offshore platforms. In addition, {{some aspects of the}} design of the fabric straps could be adapted to such other items as lifting straps, parachute straps, and automotive safety belts. Figure 2 depicts selected aspects of the design of a vessel of this type with a toroidal configuration. The bladder serves as an impermeable layer to keep air within the pressure vessel and, for this purpose, is sealed to the central structural core. The web includes longitudinal and circumferential straps. To help maintain the proper shape upon inflation after storage, longitudinal and circumferential straps are indexed together at several of their intersections. Because the web is not required to provide a pressure seal and the bladder is not required to sustain structural loads, the bladder and the web can be optimized for their respective functions. Thus, the bladder can be sealed directly to the rigid core without having to include the web in the seal substructure, and the web can be designed for strength. The ends of the longitudinal straps are attached {{to the ends of the}} rigid structural core by means of <b>clevises.</b> Each clevis pin is surrounded by a roller, around which a longitudinal strap is wrapped to form a lap seam with itself. The roller is of a large diameter chosen to reduce bending of the fibers in the strap. The roller also serves to equalize the load in the portions of the strap on both sides of the clevis pin. The lap seam is formed near the clevis by use of a tapered diamond stitch: This stitch is designed specifically to allow fibers in the stitch and strap to relax under load in such a manner that the load becomes more nearly evenly distributed among all fibers in the stitch region. Thus, the tapered diamond stitch prevents load concentrations that could cause premature failure of the strap and thereby increases the strength of the strap/structural-core joint. The lap seam can be rated at > 90 percent of the strength of the strap material...|$|E
40|$|Part of the {{redesign}} of the SRMs for the Space Shuttle involved {{the substitution of}} three new capture cylinders for three of the previously used cylinders. These new cylinders mate with the old standard case segments {{in each of the}} three field joints. The new capture cylinders contain an integral capture latch on the tang end which mates with a case clevis during stackup at KSC. The capture cylinders also contain a groove in the capture latch to provide for a third 0 -ring in the joint and are designed to achieve a metal-to- metal interference fit between the capture latch and the mating clevis. An unexpected fretting problem has occurred on the tang capture feature and the inner clevis leg interference fit surfaces on flight hardware since STS- 26. Varying degrees of fretting damage have been found on the case segments from different flight motors. Fretting is a wear phenomena that occurs when two tightly fitting metal surfaces are subject to cyclic relative motion of extremely small amplitudes (generally less than 0. 010 -inch) in the absence of adequate lubrication. It is adhesive ("cold" - welding) in nature and vibration is its essential causative factor. This problem has manifested itself on the flight motors as a series of pits and axial gouges on the inside diameter (ID) surfaces of the inner clevis legs and the outside diameter (OD) surfaces of the tang capture features. The problem occurs in varying degrees of severity in all of the field joints. It is not believed that fretting is a flight safety issue. However, it could become a reusability issue if left unattended. Fretting has been encountered in other industries for many years and measures that will prevent or reduce it have been devised. These include: elimination or reduction of vibration (amplitudes and/or frequencies), elimination of slip, improved lubrication between parts, increased surface separation, increased interference, inducing residual compressive stresses in the surfaces of the mating parts, and employing non-fretting interference shims. Looking at each of these separately; vibration and slip occur in varying degrees and magnitudes in the field joints (as part of the roll-out, launch, flight, splashdown, flotation, and/or tow back) and are difficult to define or eliminate. Improved lubrication is something that was evaluated since it would be the simplest change to incorporate, but little or no improvement was found. Increasing surface separation would defeat the purpose of the interference fit. The effect of increasing the interference fit is unknown. Additional shot peening and/or surface rolling to impart residual compressive stresses in the joints undoubtedly would alter the characteristics and finish of the sealing surfaces of the motor cases. Also, experimental data' indicate that the tangs and <b>clevises</b> already have residual compressive stress fields on their surfaces yet fretting occurs. These stresses probably result from the case machining and the glass beading used to clean these surfaces...|$|E
