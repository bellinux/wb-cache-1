5|$|CFS {{was inaugurated}} at Point Cook, Victoria, in March 1913, and trained over 150 pilots of the Australian Flying Corps during World WarI. It was disbanded in December 1919, {{and the newly}} formed RAAF's No.1 Flying Training School took on its {{function}} in 1921. Re-formed under EATS at Point <b>Cook</b> <b>in</b> April 1940, CFS relocated to New South Wales the following month, based first at Camden, then at Tamworth from April 1942, and finally at Parkes from January 1944. It returned to Point <b>Cook</b> <b>in</b> September 1944. By the end of World WarII, the school had produced more than 3,600 instructors. It transferred to East Sale in November 1947.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryMichael E. DikemanThe CVap steam {{generation}} oven {{was compared to}} a Blodgett forced-air, convection oven to examine effects of cooking method on yields, cooked color, tenderness, and sensory traits of beef Longissimus lumborum (LL), Deep pectoralis (DP), and Biceps femoris (BF) muscles cooked to three endpoint temperatures (65. 6, 71. 1, and 76. 7 °C). For each cooking treatment, four roasts were <b>cooked</b> <b>in</b> the CVap oven for a pre-determined, average amount of time, and two roasts were <b>cooked</b> <b>in</b> the Blodgett oven until they reached desired internal endpoint temperature. Cooking yields were higher (P ≤ 0. 05) for BF and LL roasts <b>cooked</b> <b>in</b> the CVap. Slice shear force (SSF) for BF roasts <b>cooked</b> <b>in</b> the CVap were lower (P ≤ 0. 05), whereas, SSF values for DP roasts <b>cooked</b> <b>in</b> the Blodgett were lower (P ≤ 0. 05). No oven difference (P > 0. 05) was found for LL roasts. Sensory tenderness scores for BF roasts <b>cooked</b> <b>in</b> the CVap were slightly higher (P ≤ 0. 05) than roasts <b>cooked</b> <b>in</b> the Blodgett. Sensory scores for LL roasts <b>cooked</b> <b>in</b> the CVap were slightly higher but were also drier (both P ≤ 0. 05). The CVap oven offers tenderization and cooking yield advantages for certain muscles...|$|R

5|$|Because {{mechanical}} refrigeration is energy intensive, active collectors {{are typically}} restricted {{to places where}} there is no supply of water that can be desalinated or purified at a lower cost and that are sufficiently far from a supply of fresh water to make transport uneconomical. Such circumstances are uncommon, and even then large installations such as that tried in the 1930s at <b>Cook</b> <b>in</b> South Australia failed because of the cost of running the installation – it was cheaper to transport water over large distances.|$|E

5|$|On 13 May 1787 a {{fleet of}} 11 ships, which {{came to be known}} as the First Fleet, was sent by the British Admiralty from England to New Holland.

The genera Maximiliana and Orbignya were described by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius in 1826 and 1837 respectively.

5|$|The {{plan was}} that the convoy sail north to {{rendezvous}} at Lord Howe Island, then set a course broadly parallel to the Great Barrier Reef {{with the aim of}} reaching the Dutch port of Batavia. From there the convoy would sail west through the Sunda Straits to the Cape of Good Hope, then north through the Atlantic to England. This route was comparatively well mapped – the first part largely mirroring that of James <b>Cook</b> <b>in</b> his first voyage in the Pacific from 1768 to 1771, and the remainder from Batavia being the traditional route of Dutch East Indiamen returning to Europe. Shortland estimated the voyage would take the convoy between six and ten months.|$|E
