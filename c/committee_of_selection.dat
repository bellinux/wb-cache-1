25|$|In July 2007, Vaz {{was elected}} as {{the chair of}} the Home Affairs Select Committee. Select {{committee}} members are usually proposed by the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Selection</b> which, under the Standing Orders of the House, nominates members to select committees., but unusually Vaz was the only nomination made by Harriet Harman, Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal. Harman argued that this was because there was not sufficient time to go through the usual procedure before the impending summer recess. The Chairman of the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Selection</b> told the House that the Committee had been ready to meet earlier that week, but had been advised by the Government that there was no business for it to transact. Vaz replaced John Denham on 26 July 2007. Vaz was re-elected to the Committee's chairmanship in June 2015.|$|E
25|$|From 1945 Touche was Chairman of the <b>Committee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Selection</b> {{responsible}} for picking Members for other committee service. As a senior Member, {{he was often}} delegated to take the chair in Standing Committees on Bills. He was knighted in 1952, and in November 1956 was made Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means (second Deputy Speaker). This took {{him out of the}} normal party political fray as the Deputy Speaker did not speak, although in December 1958 he was involved in a row over a defence debate. After a Conservative filibuster, Touche passed over Aneurin Bevan and called Christopher Soames to close the debate, but Bevan also insisted on speaking. Touche insisted that he had no choice, while Bevan and Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell objected; eventually the Speaker took the chair and endorsed his Deputy's actions.|$|E

After her return to Provincetown in 1926, Lazzell tore down her studio and had a new {{building}} constructed, as the fish house was too cold during the winter. She participated in a show called [...] "Fifty Prints of the Year" [...] where she debuted her compositions The Violet Jug and Trees. She was particularly influenced by Gleizes and produced a series of abstract Synthetic cubist paintings based on the golden ratio, including Painting VIII.|$|E

50|$|Fellowships are {{intended}} to provide gifted and skilled people {{the opportunity to work}} with as much creative freedom as possible. They are not available to support training or immediate postgraduate work. Fellowships last for between six and twelve months (occasionally longer). The average award amount in 2003 was US$36,000 to 221 fellows. The Foundation supports only individuals. It does not make grants to institutions or organizations. According to Foundation president Edward Hirsch, between 1925 and 2005 the Foundation granted close to $240 million in Fellowships to more than 15,500 individuals. The Foundation selects its Fellows on the basis of two separate competitions, one for Canada and the United States, the other for Latin America and the Caribbean. Competitors submit applications to one <b>of</b> the two <b>Committees</b> <b>of</b> <b>Selection,</b> consisting <b>of</b> about six distinguished scholars or artists.|$|R

40|$|A {{committee}} selection rule (or, multiwinner voting rule) is {{a mapping}} {{that takes a}} collection of strict preference rankings and a positive integer k as input, and outputs one or more subsets of candidates of size k. In this paper we consider committee selection rules that {{can be viewed as}} generalizations of single-winner scoring rules, including SNTV, Bloc, k-Borda, STV, as well as several variants of the Chamberlin–Courant rule and the Monroe rule and their approximations. We identify two natural broad classes <b>of</b> <b>committee</b> <b>selection</b> rules, and show that many of the existing rules belong to one or both of these classes. We then formulate a number of desirable properties <b>of</b> <b>committee</b> <b>selection</b> rules, and evaluate the rules we consider with respect to these properties...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a two phase procedure to select salient features (variables) for classification committees. Both filter and wrapper approaches to feature selection are combined in this work. In the first phase, definitely redundant features are eliminated based on the paired t-test. The test compares the saliency of the candidate and the noise features. In the second phase, the genetic search is employed. The search integrates the steps of training, aggregation <b>of</b> <b>committee</b> members, <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> hyper-parameters, and <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> salient features into the same learning process. A small number of genetic iterations needed {{to find a solution}} is the characteristic feature of the genetic search procedure developed. The experimental tests performed on five real-world problems have shown that significant improvements in Classification accuracy can be obtained in a small number of iterations if compared to the case of using all the features available...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Different {{classification}} tasks require different learning {{schemes to}} be satisfactorily solved. Most real-world datasets can be modeled only by complex structures resulting from deep data exploration {{with a number}} of different classification and data transformation methods. The search through the space of complex structures must be augmented with reliable validation strategies. All these techniques were necessary to build accurate models for the five high-dimensional datasets of the NIPS 2003 Feature Selection Challenge. Several feature selection algorithms (e. g. based on variance, correlation coefficient, decision trees) and several classification schemes (e. g. nearest neighbors, Normalized RBF, Support Vector Machines) were used to build complex models which transform the data and then classify. <b>Committees</b> <b>of</b> feature <b>selection</b> models and ensemble classifiers were also very helpful to construct models of high generalization abilities. ...|$|R
