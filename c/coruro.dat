50|$|The <b>coruro</b> (Spalacopus cyanus) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Octodontidae. It is {{monotypic}} within the genus Spalacopus. The species is endemic to central Chile, {{where it has been}} found {{in a wide variety of}} habitats, from coastal to montane. It is fossorial and lives in colonies.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Coruros</b> feed entirely {{underground}} on grasses, herbs, {{roots and}} bulbs of geophytes such as Leucocoryne ixioides (which forms {{the bulk of}} its diet), [...] Dioscorea longipes, or species of Libertia, Sisyrinchium or Alophia.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coruros</b> occur {{along the}} coast from Alicahue (32°19'S) to Los Cipreses (34°01'S), and in the Andes up to 3500 m {{altitude}} from Alicahue (32°19'S) to Los Cipreses (34°01'S). It inhabits a range of habitats including alpine grasslands in the mountains, acacia savannah in the Chilean Central Valley, semi-stabilized sand dunes and coastal grassland.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coruros</b> are colonial rodents, {{a number}} of {{individuals}} occupying a single burrow system. They are also unusual amongst rodents {{in that they are}} nomadic; when their food is becoming exhausted in one locality, they move as a group to another locality and create a new burrow. It is a vocal species, emitting a range of distinctive calls.|$|R
50|$|Members of {{the genus}} Aconaemys are {{referred}} to as rock rats, and members of genera Octodon and Octodontomys are called degus, though the name degu on its own historically implied O. degu. The single member of Spalacopus, S. cyanus, is called the <b>coruro.</b> Members of the other genera are called viscacha rats.|$|E
50|$|The olive {{grass mouse}} is mostly diurnal. In grassy habitats, it creates runways {{and makes a}} nest of grasses in a tussock, among roots or under a rock. It can climb and also dig, and in Chile it {{sometimes}} occupies burrows made by other mammals such as the <b>coruro</b> (Spalacopus cyanus). It feeds on berries, seeds, shoots, leaves, fungi and small invertebrates. It breeds in spring and summer and litter sizes average five young. Under favourable conditions, and in El Niño years, populations can increase dramatically. This mouse is preyed on by barn owls (Tyto tyto) and lesser horned owls (Bubo magellanicus), various other birds and foxes.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} visual ecology in subterranean mammals and possible behavioral visual tests in African mole-rats (Bathyergidae). It provides first results on visual depth perception testing in these strictly subterranean rodents. The depth perception was examined in three species of mole-rats (Heliophobius argeteocinereus, Fukomys mechowii, F. darlingi), in <b>coruro</b> (Spalacopus cyanus) and laboratory mouse (Mus musculus) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Coruros</b> are robust rodents {{with large}} heads, short necks and stocky bodies. The fur {{is short and}} dark brown, turning blackish on the feet. Their eyes and ears are small and their tails are short and smooth. They are {{strongly}} modified for life underground. They have large incisors that curve forward and which are used to loosen soil and gnaw through roots, strong forelimbs for digging and powerful hind limbs for moving soil and kicking {{it out of the}} entrance to the burrow.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: South American tuco-tucos (genus Ctenomys) {{and related}} <b>coruros</b> (genus Spalacopus), North American pocket gophers (family Geomyidae), and African mole rats (family Bathyergidae) are {{lineages}} of rodents that colonized the sub-terranean niche independently. An energetically demanding lifestyle, {{coupled with the}} hypoxic atmosphere characteristic of the subterranean environment may change the selective regime of genes that encode proteins involved in cellular respi-ration. Here, we examined the molecular evolution of the cytochome b gene, a mitochondrially-encoded gene participating in oxidative phosphorylation, in these lineages and their above-ground relatives. Using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian approaches, we estimated rates of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitutions. We found a significantly higher ratio (dN/dS) {{in each of the}} subterranean groups with respect to their non-subterranean counterparts. Using an al-ternative procedure that tests for positive selection on quantitative physicochemical amino acid properties, we found that i) subterranean mole rats and tucu-tucus showed more sites whose amino acid properties may be under positive selection in the cytochome b gene than their non-subterranean relatives, and ii) some of the sites identified to be under selection ex-clusively in subterranean taxa were shared among all subterranean taxa. The results given by these two approaches are consistent with each other and suggest a link between directional selection at the molecular level and niche shift...|$|R
40|$|Daily {{patterns}} of activity were studied under laboratory conditions in 12 coruros, Spalacopus cyanus, subterranean social rodents originally from Chile. When able to burrow, coruros spent 90 % {{of the total}} time underground, and surface activity occurred during the 1 st hours of darkness. When prevented from burrowing, locomotory activity of <b>coruro</b> groups peaked near the onset of darkness but also occurred during episodes of light. Individually housed coruros displayed a clear nocturnal activity pattern. Coruros exhibited endogenous circadian rhythms entrained by a light–dark cycle. ...|$|E
