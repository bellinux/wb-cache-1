25|$|Air-conditioning and {{refrigeration}} and HVAC: Centrifugal compressors {{quite often}} supply the compression in water <b>chillers</b> cycles. Because {{of the wide}} variety of vapor compression cycles (thermodynamic cycle, thermodynamics) and {{the wide variety of}} workings gases (refrigerants), centrifugal compressors are used {{in a wide range of}} sizes and configurations. Use of real gas properties is needed to properly design, test and analyze the performance of these machines. Standards set by the industry for these compressors include ASHRAE, ASME & API.|$|E
25|$|In {{low-rise}} structures, {{the support}} rooms (<b>chillers,</b> transformers, boilers, pumps and air handling units) {{can be put}} in basements or roof space—areas which have low rental value. There is, however, {{a limit to how}} far this plant can be located from the area it serves. The farther away it is the larger the risers for ducts and pipes from this plant to the floors they serve and the more floor area these risers take. In practice this means that in highrise buildings this plant is located on 'plant levels' at intervals up the building.|$|E
25|$|Aquarium heaters {{combine a}} heating element with a thermostat, {{allowing}} the aquarist to regulate water temperature at a level above that of the surrounding air, whereas coolers and <b>chillers</b> (refrigeration devices) are for use anywhere, such as cold water aquaria, where the ambient room temperature is above the desired tank temperature. Thermometers used include glass alcohol thermometers, adhesive external plastic strip thermometers, and battery-powered LCD thermometers. In addition, some aquarists use air pumps attached to airstones or water pumps to increase water circulation and supply adequate gas exchange at the water surface. Wave-making devices have also been constructed to provide wave action.|$|E

25|$|Because {{water has}} good {{properties}} as a coolant, water plus antifreeze {{is used in}} internal combustion engines and other heat transfer applications, such as HVAC <b>chillers</b> and solar water heaters. The purpose of antifreeze is to prevent a rigid enclosure from bursting due to expansion when water freezes. Commercially, both the additive (pure concentrate) and the mixture (diluted solution) are called antifreeze, depending on the context. Careful selection of an antifreeze can enable a wide temperature range in which the mixture remains in the liquid phase, which is critical to efficient heat transfer and the proper functioning of heat exchangers.|$|E

Similarly, more than 500 induction lighting fixtures have been installed within it, as well as 11 high-efficiency condensing boilers for space heating in the stadium, melting snow, and heating the field. Also, two high-efficiency electric <b>chillers</b> have been installed for the air-conditioned regions of Lambeau Field.|$|E
25|$|Adsorption {{is present}} in many natural, physical, {{biological}} and chemical systems and is widely used in industrial applications such as heterogeneous catalysts, activated charcoal, capturing and using waste heat to provide cold water for air conditioning and other process requirements (adsorption <b>chillers),</b> synthetic resins, increasing storage capacity of carbide-derived carbons and water purification. Adsorption, ion exchange and chromatography are sorption processes in which certain adsorbates are selectively transferred from the fluid phase {{to the surface of}} insoluble, rigid particles suspended in a vessel or packed in a column. Pharmaceutical industry applications, which use adsorption as a means to prolong neurological exposure to specific drugs or parts thereof, are lesser known.|$|E

50|$|The {{most popular}} {{technique}} is ice storage, which requires less space than water and is less costly than fuel cells or flywheels. In this application, a standard chiller runs {{at night to}} produce an ice pile. Water then circulates through the pile during the day to chill water that would normally be the <b>chiller's</b> daytime output.|$|R
50|$|The {{most widely}} used form of this {{technology}} {{can be found in}} campus-wide air conditioning or chilled water systems of large buildings. Air conditioning systems, especially in commercial buildings, are the biggest contributors to peak electrical loads seen on hot summer days in various countries. In this application, a standard chiller runs at night to produce an ice pile. Water then circulates through the pile during the day to produce chilled water that would normally be the <b>chiller's</b> daytime output.|$|R
25|$|Although {{there are}} {{similarities}} between adsorption <b>chillers</b> and absorption refrigeration, {{the former is}} based on the interaction between gases and solids. The adsorption chamber of the chiller is filled with a solid material (for example zeolite, silica gel, alumina, active carbon or certain types of metal salts), which in its neutral state has adsorbed the refrigerant. When heated, the solid desorbs (releases) refrigerant vapour, which subsequently is cooled and liquefied. This liquid refrigerant then provides a cooling effect at the evaporator from its enthalpy of vaporization. In the final stage the refrigerant vapour is (re)adsorbed into the solid. As an adsorption chiller requires no compressor, it is relatively quiet.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} the {{equation}} of state, {{it is important to}} remember that while air and nitrogen properties (near standard atmospheric conditions) are easily and accurately estimated by this simple relationship, there are many centrifugal compressor applications where the ideal relationship is inadequate. For example, centrifugal compressors used for large air conditioning systems (water <b>chillers)</b> use a refrigerant as a working gas that cannot be modeled as an ideal gas. Another example are centrifugal compressors design and built for the petroleum industry. Most of the hydrocarbon gases such as methane and ethylene are best modeled as a real gas equation of state rather than ideal gases. The Wikipedia entry for equations of state is very thorough.|$|E
25|$|Combined {{heat and}} power (CHP) fuel cell systems, {{including}} Micro {{combined heat and power}} (MicroCHP) systems {{are used to}} generate both electricity and heat for homes (see home fuel cell), office building and factories. The system generates constant electric power (selling excess power back to the grid when it is not consumed), {{and at the same time}} produces hot air and water from the waste heat. As the result CHP systems have the potential to save primary energy as they can make use of waste heat which is generally rejected by thermal energy conversion systems. A typical capacity range of home fuel cell is 1–3kWel / 4–8kWth. CHP systems linked to absorption <b>chillers</b> use their waste heat for refrigeration.|$|E

25|$|HVAC use of {{a cooling}} tower pairs the cooling tower with a {{water-cooled}} chiller or water-cooled condenser. A ton of air-conditioning {{is defined as the}} removal of 12,000 BTU/hour (3500 W). The equivalent ton on the cooling tower side actually rejects about 15,000 BTU/hour (4400 W) due to the additional waste heat-equivalent of the energy needed to drive the <b>chiller's</b> compressor. This equivalent ton is defined as the heat rejection in cooling 3 US gallons/minute (1,500 pound/hour) of water 10°F (6°C), which amounts to 15,000 BTU/hour, assuming a chiller coefficient of performance (COP) of 4.0. This COP is equivalent to an energy efficiency ratio (EER) of 14.|$|R

25|$|An {{accessible}} entrance—opened by Anne, Princess Royal, {{and named}} after her—was added in 1982 and the Minto Wing was eventually converted from residences to offices. Then, at the prompting of Governor General Michaëlle Jean, the main facade of Rideau Hall underwent a major renovation through 2006 and 2007, {{overseen by the}} National Capital Commission, which {{has been responsible for}} the maintenance and upkeep of the building and its grounds since 1986. Masonry was treated and restored, the original sash windows rehabilitated and stripped of their lead paint, and the copper roof of the Mappin Wing was repaired. This was the first time any considerable work had been done on the front façade since the 1960s. A project began in 2012 to replace the building's climate control system—consisting of three large external <b>chillers</b> and multiple window-mounted air conditioners—with a geothermal heating and cooling system, expected to supply approximately half of the building's heating requirements during winter, until the geothermal system is expanded in future.|$|E

50|$|Thermal {{energy storage}} {{is also used}} for {{combustion}} gas turbine air inlet cooling. Instead of shifting electrical demand to the night, this technique shifts generation capacity to the day. To generate ice at night, the turbine is often mechanically connected to a large <b>chiller's</b> compressor. During peak daytime loads, water is circulated between the ice pile and a heat exchanger {{in front of the}} turbine air intake, cooling the intake air to near freezing temperatures. Since the air is colder, the turbine can compress more air with a given amount of compressor power. Typically, both the generated electrical power and turbine efficiency rise when the inlet cooling system is activated. This system is similar to the compressed air energy storage system.|$|R

40|$|A trouble by smectite-amorphous silica {{precipitation}} {{happened at}} two production wells in the Onikobe Geothermal Power Station, {{northern part of}} Japan. It is considered that the reason of the down-hole scaling {{is caused by the}} mixing of two h d s of fluids in a production well, base on the facts as follows. During the drilling, there were two lost circulation zones at shallow and deep. The precipitation occurred above the shallow feed zone. The pH of production fluid had changed radically from neutral to acid while the scaling trouble had occurred. According to the observation of cuttings and the analysis of alteration zoning of the vicinity wells, acidic altered minerals distribute at the shallow feed zone, whereas neutral alteration at the deeper. In addition to the facts above, our chemical modeling calculation, using SOLVEQ and <b>CHILLER</b> (Spycher and Reed, 1990), indicates that the mixing of the acid and the neutral fluids with some definite ratios would make a smectite supersaturated condition...|$|R
