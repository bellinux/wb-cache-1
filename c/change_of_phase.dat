500|$|Phase {{transition}} {{refers to}} the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> of a system, which is brought about by change in an external parameter such as temperature. [...] Classical phase transition occurs at finite temperature when {{the order of the}} system was destroyed. [...] For example, when ice melts and becomes water, the ordered crystal structure is destroyed. [...] In quantum phase transitions, [...] the temperature is set to absolute zero, and the non-thermal control parameter, such as pressure or magnetic field, [...] causes the phase transitions when order is destroyed by quantum fluctuations originating from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Here, the different quantum phases of the system refer to distinct ground states of the Hamiltonian. [...] Understanding the behavior of quantum phase transition is important in the difficult tasks of explaining the properties of rare-earth magnetic insulators, high-temperature superconductors, and other substances.|$|E
