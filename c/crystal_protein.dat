40|$|Plant-parasitic {{nematodes}} (PPNs) are piercing/sucking pests, {{which cause}} severe damage to crops worldwide, and {{are difficult to}} control. The cyst and root-knot nematodes (RKN) are sedentary endoparasites that develop specialized multinucleate feeding structures from the plant cells called syncytia or giant cells respectively. Within these structures the nematodes produce feeding tubes, which act as molecular sieves with exclusion limits. For example, Heterodera schachtii is reportedly unable to ingest proteins larger than 28 kDa. However, it is unknown yet what is the molecular exclusion limit of the Meloidogyne hapla. Several types of Bacillus thuringiensis <b>crystal</b> <b>proteins</b> showed toxicity to M. hapla. To monitor the entry pathway of <b>crystal</b> <b>proteins</b> into M. hapla, second-stage juveniles (J 2) were treated with NHS-rhodamine labeled nematicidal <b>crystal</b> <b>proteins</b> (Cry 55 Aa, Cry 6 Aa, and Cry 5 Ba). Confocal microscopic observation showed that these <b>crystal</b> <b>proteins</b> were initially detected in the stylet and esophageal lumen, and subsequently in the gut.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the protein composition and the insecticidal spectrum of crystals of 29 Bacillus thuringiensis strains active against lepidopteran larvae. All <b>crystals</b> contained <b>proteins</b> of 130 to 140 kilodaltons (kDa) which could be grouped into three types by the molecular weight of the protoxin and the trypsin-activated core fragment. Proteins of the three types showed a characteristic insecticidal spectrum when tested against five lepidopteran species. Type A <b>crystal</b> <b>proteins</b> were protoxins of 130 or 133 kDa, which were processed into 60 -kDa toxins by trypsin. Several genes encoding <b>crystal</b> <b>proteins</b> of this type have been cloned and sequenced earlier. They are highly conserved in the N-terminal half of the toxic fragment and were previously classified in three subtypes (the 4. 5 -, 5. 3 -, and 6. 6 -kilobase subtypes) based on the restriction map of their genes. The present study shows that different proteins of these three subtypes were equally toxic against Manduca sexta and Pieris brassicae and had no detectable activity against Spodoptera littoralis. However, the 4. 5 -, 5. 3 -, and 6. 6 -kilobase subtypes differed in their toxicity against Heliothis virescens and Mamestra brassicae. Type B <b>crystal</b> <b>proteins</b> consisted of 140 -kDa protoxins with a 55 -kDa tryptic core fragment. These were only active {{against one of the}} five insect species tested (P. brassicae). The protoxin and the trypsin-activated toxin of type C were 135 - and 63 -kDa proteins, respectively. Proteins of this type were associated with high toxicity against S. littoralis and M. brassicae.

50|$|Cry6Aa is a toxic <b>crystal</b> <b>protein</b> {{generated}} by the bacterial family Bacillus thuringiensis during sporulation. This protein {{is a member of}} the alpha pore forming toxins family, which gives it insecticidal qualities advantageous in agricultural pest control. Each Cry protein has some level of target specificity; Cry6Aa has specific toxic action against coleopteran insects and nematodes. The corresponding B. thuringiensis gene, cry6aa, is located on bacterial plasmids. Along with several other Cry protein genes, cry6aa can be genetically recombined in Bt corn and Bt cotton so the plants produce specific toxins. Insects are developing resistance to the most commonly inserted proteins like Cry1Ac. Since Cry6Aa proteins function differently than other Cry proteins, they are combined with other proteins to decrease the development of pest resistance. Recent studies suggest this protein functions better in combination with other virulence factors such as other Cry proteins and metalloproteinases.|$|E

Detergent (Triton X- 100) -insoluble cytoskeletons from vegetative (AX 2) amebae are enriched in a 70 kDa Concanavalin A (Con A) -binding protein (gp 70). An enriched fraction of gp 70 was prepared by Con A affinity chromatography of cytoskeletons from axenically-grown cells.

40|$|The western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, is a {{significant}} pest of corn in the United States. The development of transgenic corn hybrids resistant to rootworm feeding damage depends on the identification of genes encoding insecticidal proteins toxic to rootworm larvae. In this study, a bioassay screen was used to identify several isolates of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis active against rootworm. These bacterial isolates each produce distinct <b>crystal</b> <b>proteins</b> with approximate molecular masses of 13 to 15 kDa and 44 kDa. Insect bioassays demonstrated that both protein classes are required for insecticidal activity against this rootworm species. The genes encoding these proteins are organized in apparent operons and are associated with other genes encoding <b>crystal</b> <b>proteins</b> of unknown function. The antirootworm proteins produced by B. thuringiensis strains EG 5899 and EG 9444 closely resemble previously described <b>crystal</b> <b>proteins</b> of the Cry 34 A and Cry 35 A classes.

Strain EG 4961 (isolated by the use of a cryIIIA-related probe) contained a cryIIIA-hybridizing plasmid of approximately 95 MDa and synthesized <b>crystal</b> <b>proteins</b> of 74, 70, and 30 kDa. Structural relationships among the <b>crystal</b> <b>proteins</b> of strains EG 2838 and EG 4961 were detected; antibodies to the CryIIIA protein toxic to coleopterans reacted with the 74 - and 70 -kDa proteins of EG 2838 and EG 4961, antibodies to the 32 -kDa plus 28 -kDa proteins of EG 2838 reacted with the 30 -kDa protein of EG 4961, and antibodies to the 200 -kDa proteins of EG 2838 reacted with the 28 -kDa protein of EG 2838. Experiments with B. thuringiensis flagella antibody reagents demonstrated that EG 2838 belongs to H serotype 9 (reference strain B. thuringiensis subsp. tolworthi) and that EG 4961 belongs to H serotype 18 (reference strain B. thuringiensis subsp. kumamotoensis).

By using a synthetic 27 -base oligonucleotide corresponding to a stretch of nine N-terminal amino acids of a tryptic fragment of purified <b>crystal</b> <b>protein</b> of var. tenebrionis as a probe, recombinant colonies were screened by in situ hybridization for the presence of the <b>crystal</b> <b>protein</b> gene. Positive clones obtained from this screening were further tested for toxicity. One recombinant, NSBP 544 (which contained a 5. 9 -kilobase BamHI insert), was toxic to larvae of Colorado potato beetle. Immunoblot analysis revealed that this clone produces two crystal-specific antigens of 65 and 73 kDa as do sporulating var. tenebrionis cells. However, purified crystal inclusions from var. tenebrionis contain a primary peptide component of 65 kDa. A 1932 -base-pair open reading frame with a coding capacity of 73, 119 Da has been identified by nucleotide sequencing analysis of the cloned <b>crystal</b> <b>protein.</b> In addition, mung bean nuclease mapping indicates that transcription of the <b>crystal</b> <b>protein</b> of var. tenebrionis initiates 130 base pairs upstream from the translational start site.

Crystals from such preparations had a 50 % lethal concentration of 6 ng of protein per ml for the larvae of the mosquito Culex pipiens. When subjected to {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} under denaturing conditions, the proteins in B. sphaericus crystals migrated in positions corresponding to 43, 63, 98, 110, and 125 kilodaltons (kDa); solubilization of the crystal at pH 12 with NaOH eliminated all but the bands at 43 and 63 kDa. Since NaOH-solubilized preparations were toxic to mosquito larvae, these proteins were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and antiserum was obtained to each. Analysis of the two purified proteins indicated that the 43 -kDa protein was toxic to mosquito larvae (50 % lethal concentration, 35 ng of protein per ml), whereas the 63 -kDa protein was not. Further differences between them were their amino acid compositions, their lack of immunological cross-reactivity, their opposite net charges at pH 7. 5, and their susceptibility to digestion by larval midgut proteases (the 63 -kDa protein was highly susceptible, whereas the 43 -kDa protein was not). The sequence of the 40 N-terminal residues of the 43 -kDa protein was determined and found to contain {{a high percentage of}} hydrophobic amino acids. The sequence of the 63 -kDa protein could not be determined, since it had multiple N termini. By electrophoretically separating the <b>crystal</b> <b>proteins</b> and then electroblotting onto nitrocellulose paper and visualizing the bands with antisera to the 43 - and 63 -kDa proteins in conjunction with an immunoblot assay, {{it was found that the}} high-molecular-mass <b>crystal</b> <b>proteins</b> (98 to 125 kDa) contained antigenic determinants of both proteins.

The frequency of cells with a crystal-like inclusion in the culture approached 1 %. The appearance of the <b>crystal</b> <b>protein</b> in cells coincided in time with spore morphogenesis. However, the process of <b>crystal</b> <b>protein</b> formation and sporulation are two alternatives: the cells either form the <b>crystal</b> <b>protein</b> or continue spore morphogenesis. Fractionation of cells in the stationary growth phase on a Percoll density gradient showed that the cells containing the <b>crystal</b> <b>protein</b> accumulated in the fraction corresponding to a 1. 14 -g/ml Percoll density. The cells were disintegrated by sonication, and alkaline-extracted proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, the fraction enriched with crystal-containing cells showed practically a single band with a molecular weight of 47, 000 that corresponded to the crystal-forming protein. The antigenic features and amino acid composition indicated certain similarities between the crystal-forming protein in B. subtilis Cgr 4 cells and the spore coat protein...|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of Bacillus thuringiensis Cyt 1 Aa protein to sheep blowfly larvae {{depends on its}} solubilization and proteolytic activation. Cyt 1 Aa crystals were not toxic. Full-length and trypsin-digested Cyt 1 Aa proteins were toxic to larvae of three species of sheep blowfly. Neither full-length nor trypsin-digested Cyt 2 A soluble <b>crystal</b> <b>proteins</b> were toxic...|$|R
40|$|The {{microscopic}} {{mapping of}} the variation in degree of perfection and in type of defects in entire <b>protein</b> <b>crystals</b> by x-rays may well be a prerequisite for better understanding causes of lattice imperfections, the growth history, and properties of <b>protein</b> <b>crystals.</b> However, x-ray microscopic characterization of bulk <b>protein</b> <b>crystals,</b> in the as-grown state, is frequently more challenging than that of small molecular crystals due to the experimental difficulties arising largely from the unique features possessed by <b>protein</b> <b>crystals.</b> In this presentation, we will illustrate ssme recent activities in employing coherence-based phase contrast x-ray imaging and high-angular-resolution diffraction techniques for mapping microdefects and the degree of perfection of <b>protein</b> <b>crystals,</b> and demonstrate a correlation between crystal perfection, diffraction phenomena., and crystallization conditions. The observed features and phenomena will be discussed in context to gain insight into the nature of defects, nucleation and growth, and the properties of <b>protein</b> <b>crystals...</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{the early}} 1980 s, it was {{discovered}} that “there are genes responsible of the production of the <b>crystal</b> <b>proteins</b> in Bt spore and these genes are carried on plasmids” (Crickmore et al. 1998). Hofte and Whitely (1989) termed these “cry genes” and the protein they encode “cry proteins” (for <b>crystal)</b> and cyt <b>proteins</b> (for cytolytic). They classified these genes, or crystals, based on the spectrum of activity of the proteins (insect order), their size or mass, and their apparent relatedness as deduced from nucleotide and amino acid sequences.|$|R
