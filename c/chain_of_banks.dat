After his mission, {{while working in}} a family enterprise in Blacksmith Fork Canyon, he learned of the untimely death of his father, David Eccles.

Eccles expanded the banking interests into a large western <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> called Eccles-Browning Affiliated Banks. He was a millionaire by age 22. The company withstood several bank runs during the Great Depression and, as a leading banker, Eccles became involved with the creation of the Emergency Banking Act of 1933 and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. After a brief stint at the Treasury Department and with the support of treasury secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr., Eccles was appointed by President Roosevelt as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Eccles was reappointed chair in 1936, 1940, and 1944 and served until 1948. In February 1944, Roosevelt appointed Eccles for another 14-year term on the board and Eccles stayed on the board until 1951, when he resigned {{a few months after the}} 1951 Accord.

40|$|Due to the {{intangible}} and heterogeneous natures of services, classical control approaches might {{not provide the}} relevant safeguards to enable a typical bank to reach its objectives. Knowledge-based services result from diagnoses and evaluation performances whose value and quality levels are complex to measure as they are essentially based on perceptions and subjective opinions. Consequently, services cannot benefit from supply-chain risk approaches such as automation, statistical control process, and system reliability techniques {{in order to avoid}} any kind of disruption and quality lowering. To tackle these specific service-type risks, we suggest a new way of formalizing the risk management process adapted to the service <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks.</b> To illustrate a default of risk management, we have opted for the bank industry and the Société Générale case.

Once the online shop is operational, it could as well easily direct payments to a fourth country and eventually invest the profits in a tax haven. Moreover, very often, in order to further confuse investigators, money is transferred between a <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> accounts, creating a smoke-screen which makes investigations more difficult.|$|R
