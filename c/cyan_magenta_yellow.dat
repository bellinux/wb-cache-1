25|$|Color images {{typically}} {{consist of}} a composite of three separate grayscale images, one to represent {{each of the three}} primary colors—red, green, and blue, or RGB for short. Other colorspaces using 3-vectors for colors include HSV, CIELAB, XYZ, etc. Some colorspaces such as <b>cyan,</b> <b>magenta,</b> <b>yellow,</b> and black (CMYK) may represent color by four dimensions. All of these are treated as vector-valued functions over a two-dimensional sampled domain.|$|E
25|$|When color reproductions are made, {{the image}} is {{separated}} into its component colors by taking multiple photographs filtered for each color. One resultant film or plate represents each of the <b>cyan,</b> <b>magenta,</b> <b>yellow,</b> and black data. Color printing is a binary system, where ink is either present or not present, so all color separations to be printed must be translated into dots at some stage of the work-flow. Traditional line screens which are amplitude modulated had problems with moiré but were used until stochastic screening became available. A stochastic (or frequency modulated) dot pattern creates a sharper image.|$|E
50|$|A color wheel {{based on}} RGB (red, green, blue) or RGV (red, green, violet) {{additive}} primaries has <b>cyan,</b> <b>magenta,</b> and <b>yellow</b> secondaries (<b>cyan</b> was previously known as cyan blue). Alternatively, the same arrangement of colors around a circle {{can be described}} as based on <b>cyan,</b> <b>magenta,</b> and <b>yellow</b> subtractive primaries, with red, green, and blue (or violet) being secondaries.|$|R

25|$|Monopack color {{films are}} based on the {{subtractive}} color system, which filters colors from white light by using superimposed cyan, magenta and yellow dye images. Those images are created from records of the amounts of red, green and blue light present at each point of the image formed by the camera lens. A subtractive primary color (<b>cyan,</b> <b>magenta,</b> <b>yellow)</b> is what remains when one of the additive primary colors (red, green, blue) has been removed from the spectrum. Eastman Kodak's monopack color films incorporated three separate layers of differently color sensitive emulsion into one strip of film. Each layer recorded one of the additive primaries and was processed to produce a dye image in the complementary subtractive primary.|$|E
