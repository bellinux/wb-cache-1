40|$|Deep {{drilling}} operation {{is one of}} the major process that is widely used in the manufacturing industry. To make a cooling channel of hot press forming die, deep drilling is a crucial process which is the drilling depth is 10 times of the drill bit diameters itself. However, the major complications that occur is the drill bits will become wear and breaks as the drilling depth keep increasing. This will impact the efficiency of the drilling process. To overcome this drawback, Tool Condition Monitoring (TCM) was introduced to refining the quality of the drilling process by monitor the {{drilling operation}}, whether by direct or indirect monitoring, thus will improve tool life expectancy by notifying the operator to stop the machine. SKD 61 which is widely used as die material and High Speed Steel (HSS) drill bit was chosen. To improve accuracy, Tri-axial Accelerometer (PCB 356 B 21) was used to detect the vibration of the drill bit when drilling process occurs. The data obtained from this experiment is in the form of acceleration and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) signal which is acceleration x, acceleration y, acceleration z, FFT x, FFT y, and FFT z. Tool condition can be classify into five types by using this data which is good condition, small <b>corner</b> <b>wear,</b> medium <b>corner</b> <b>wear,</b> large <b>corner</b> <b>wear</b> and fracture. To classify this data, machine learning method such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was employed. SVM performs classification process based on the data input vector that comprise as fault in the machine. The fault is then being produced as the pattern and SVM will recognize thus classify this pattern corresponding to the fault. Nevertheless, the major downside of SVM is less accurate of classifying result due to the data over-fitting. To get an accurate result, the data is compared with Artificial Neural Network machine learning. ANN performs an excellent classifying by determining the correct set of input data, number of hidden layers, target data, and applying a suitable algorithm, which is proven better classifying result than SVM in the aspect of classifying accuracy and number of errors. Consequently, ANN is the most suitable method to classify tool condition, and are capable to be employed for online tool failure detection system which is beneficial for optimizing tool condition in industries...|$|E
40|$|Deep twist {{drilling}} technique with length per {{diameter ratio}} {{of more than}} 10 is widely used, especially in tool and die industries. This technique can improve the quality and production of drilling products by increasing feed rate and can shorten the machining time. The limitation in this process is premature tool breakage due to tool wear, chip clogging, and tool failures. In this study, deep drilling process was analyzed via cutting force and vibrations by using three-axis force dynamometer and accelerometer sensors to detect failure criteria. Deep twist drills were analyzed through cutting parameters, such as cutting speeds, feeds, and depth of cut. The effects on the tool condition during cutting operations were measured by three-axis data of vibrations and force sensors and then analyzed in time and frequency domain. Results indicated that both sensors are capable of monitoring tool conditions. However, data produced by vibration sensors are more appropriate to detect initial conditions before tool failure. Thus, monitoring tool conditions in three axes can lead to precise data and earlier detection in the y axis instead of in the z axis. Cutting condition analysis found that cutting speed and feeds of more than 50 m/min and 0. 25 mm/rev, respectively, result in tool failures under safety threshold in x, y, and z. Tool monitoring conditions in three axes are useful to show the deep drilling process failure criterion, such as good, small <b>corner</b> <b>wear,</b> large <b>corner</b> <b>wear,</b> blunt, and fracture. Tri-axial sensors are useful in developing an online condition monitoring tool for deep drilling process, especially in tool and die industries...|$|E

According to the image processing on the image of tool electrodes, the contour information of the worn tools is obtained, and then the tool wear, especially the tool shape change in micro EDM is studied in this paper. Firstly, the Canny edge detection method is used to extract the outline image of the tool, the scatter points of outline image are curve fitted, and the mathematical description of the tool outline is presented. And then though the mathematical analysis of the fitting function, the tool shape change and tool wear law of micro EDM are analyzed.

40|$|We report herein on a {{comparison}} of the performance of two different grinding wheels (conventional and CBN) in the transverse cylindrical grinding of a eutectic alloy. Three cutting conditions were tested: rough, semi-finishing and finishing. The parameters of evaluation were the cutting force, roughness and wheel wear. The optimal cutting force and roughness values were obtained when grinding with the conventional wheel, due to the superior dressing operation performed under every cutting condition tested. Although the CBN wheel presented the best G ratio values, they were lower than expected owing to the inappropriate dressing operation applied. Excessive wheel <b>corner</b> <b>wear</b> was detected in both wheels, caused by the grinding kinematics (transverse grinding) employed. In terms of cutting force and roughness, the conventional wheel proved to be the better choice under the conditions tested.

40|$|Abstract. This paper reports {{experimental}} {{data on the}} wear of high-speed steel bimetal bandsaw blades cutting austenitic 17 - 7 stainless steel bars. Several different methods of assessing the wear modes and mechanisms are evaluated; Cutting and thrust force components, Set width, Kerf width, “Out-of-square ” cutting, Wear modes and mechanisms and Chip characteristics. The wear mode established in the current work when bandsawing austenitic stainless steel with a bimetal blade is flank and <b>corner</b> <b>wear</b> together with formation of a cutting edge radius. The cutting edge radius increases as the wear progresses, reaching 25 - 50 mm after 300 cut sections. The established wear mechanism for {{the initial stages of}} wear is mild adhesive wear of the flank surface together with built-up edge formation and break-down. As the wear reaches steady-state the mechanism is adhesive wear of the flank surface with tempering/softening of high-speed steel layers. When the wear reached the steady-state region the level of thrust and cutting force were equal and relatively high. The kerf width appears to be less than the total set width of the blade, meaning that there is compression of the set teeth as they pass through the kerf. There is segmented chip formation with an increasing amount of vibration as the teeth wear, probably due to the increasing size of cutting edge radius. This work should be of great interest to the tool designer and user associated with bandsaws...|$|E

40|$|Carbon fibre {{composites}} {{are increasingly}} being used in aircraft structures due to their superior physical and mechanical properties. The process of drilling of carbon fibre composites in aircraft manufacture is economically important since the extremely abrasive nature of the fibres limits drill life. The hole quality produced by drilling in terms of fibre pullout and matrix cracking affects the notch sensitivity of the hole. The present thesis describes an experimental and analytical study of drilling of the carbon fibre composites carried out {{with the support of}} British Aerospace (Military Aircraft Division). Full drill life testing was carried out using four low cost commercial cemented carbide drills, three of which had brazed inserts, and drill life was determined by measuring the outer drill <b>corner</b> <b>wear.</b> Hole quality was measured in terms of diametrical tolerance using accurate plug gauges. Drill forces were measured using a two component Kistler dynamometer and attempts were made to measure residual stress in the workpiece using the birefringent photoelastic technique. The hole quality was related to drill wear, cutting forces and heat generated during drilling. Independent tasks were carried out to relate cemented carbide physical and mechanical properties to wear using several standard sliding wear experiments. Three different cemented carbide tool materials were investigated in terms of cobalt layer thickness, carbide distribution and physical properties including hardness and fracture toughness. Independent sliding wear tests were performed using a Pin-on-Disc machine, lathe and machining centre. These tests allowed the materials to be ranked in terms of wear resistance when rubbing against carbon fibre composite. The fracture toughness was measured using the techniques developed by Palmqvist. The wear resistance was correlated to the physical and mechanical properties of the tool materials. Hole quality was studied experimentally using scanning electron microscopy and fibre pullout shown to be primarily dependent on the fibre-matrix interface bond strength and the intrinsic strength of the fibres. The surface morphology of the fractured fibres in areas of fibre pullout showed inultimode damage due to anisotropy of the carbon fibre composite and the dynamics of drilling. The degree and pattern of damage developed in the drilled holes was found to be highly directionally dependent. The experimental results and theoretical analysis showed that the degree of hole damage depends not only on drilling parameters but also on the material composition and the manufacturing process of the carbon fibre composite...|$|E
