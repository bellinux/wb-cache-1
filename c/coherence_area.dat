The number of temporal modes contained in the twin-beam, as well as the size of the twin <b>coherence</b> <b>areas,</b> depends on the pump intensity. Our scheme is based on spontaneous downconversion and thus does not suffer from limitations due to the finite gain of the parametric process.

Spatial {{coherence}} describes the ability for two points in space, x1 and x2, in the extent of a wave to interfere, when averaged over time. More precisely, the spatial coherence is the cross-correlation between two points in a wave for all times. If a wave has only 1 value of amplitude over an infinite length, it is perfectly spatially coherent. The range of separation between the two points over which there is significant interference defines {{the diameter of the}} <b>coherence</b> <b>area,</b> Ac [...] (Coherence length, often a feature of a source, is usually an industrial term related to the coherence time of the source, not the <b>coherence</b> <b>area</b> in the medium.)

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{homodyne}} and heterodyne experimental technique {{for the detection of}} noise intensity spectra of laser light scattered by nematic liquid crystals (n. 1. c.). We have studied the influence of laser noise on both homodyne (section 2) and heterodyne (section 3) experiments. It turns out that the laser intensity fluctuations are of importance only in the heterodyne case. It is shown experimentally that the linewidths of homodyne spectra are twice those of heterodyne spectra, which indicates that the statistical process of the director fluctuations is Gaussian (section 5). The influence on the measurements of stray light and the number of <b>coherence</b> <b>areas</b> subtended by the photodetector is discussed briefly in sections 4 and 5.

For the surface-scattering ground glass, the incident polarization state was preserved in the speckle field, and hence the DOP remained at unity regardless of the area of detection. For the volume-scattering wax, the polarization states varied with positions in the field, and consequently the DOP depended on the area of detection: the DOP decreased with an increasing area of detection, and only when the area was {{much smaller than the}} <b>coherence</b> <b>area</b> would the DOP approach unity.

40|$|Adding small {{fractions}} of cholesterol decreases the interfacial viscosity of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) monolayers by {{an order of}} magnitude per wt %. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction shows that cholesterol at these small fractions does not mix ideally with DPPC but rather induces nanophase separated structures of an ordered, primarily DPPC phase bordered by a line-active, disordered, mixed DPPC-cholesterol phase. We propose that the free area in the classic Cohen and Turnbull model of viscosity is inversely proportional to the number of molecules in the <b>coherence</b> <b>area,</b> or product of the two coherence lengths. Cholesterol significantly reduces the <b>coherence</b> <b>area</b> of the crystals as well as the interfacial viscosity. Using this free area collapses the surface viscosity data for all surface pressures and cholesterol fractions to a universal logarithmic relation.

A new method for improving interferometry and CCD using multiple subapertures is proposed. Using backprojection processing, multiple sub-aperture images are created {{for a pair}} of flights. An interferogram and coherence map is made from each subaperture. For CCD, each sub-aperture coherence map offers an independent estimate of the coherence over the same <b>area.</b> By combining <b>coherence</b> maps, low <b>coherence</b> <b>areas</b> associated with residual motion errors are reduced, shadowed areas are minimized, and the overall coherence of stationary objects between images is increased.

Damage to these fibres could lead to functional disconnection between brain regions. Electroencephalographic coherence, a measure of shared electrical activity between regions, was examined {{to determine if there}} was evidence for such disconnection. Twenty two subjects with clinically diagnosed dementia of the Alzheimer's type, 16 with multi-infarct dementia, and 18 normal controls were studied. It was hypothesised that <b>coherence</b> between <b>areas</b> presumably linked by fibres that traverse the periventricular region would be decreased in subjects with PVHs, and that PVHs would have a stronger association with decreased coherence than clinical diagnosis. It was also hypothesised that <b>coherence</b> between <b>areas</b> presumably connected by long corticocortical tracts that are neuroanatomically separated from the ventricles would be low in patients with Alzheimer's disease because of pyramidal cell death in this group, but would not be affected by the presence of PVHs. Patients with PVHs in fact had lower coherence than those without PVHs in the pre-Rolandic and post-Rolandic areas, where connecting fibres traverse the periventricular region. There was no effect of PVHs, however, on <b>coherence</b> between <b>areas</b> separated by the Rolandic fissure that were connected by long corticocortical tracts; this coherence was lowest among the patients with Alzheimer's disease. These patterns of association suggest that coherence may detect different types of neurophysiological "disconnection," and may be sensitive to selective damage to different fibre pathways...|$|R

Often such interferograms are used to observe land surface deformation {{in the order of}} centimeters over long time intervals, say up to years.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the use of}} two radar {{interferometry}} methods, PSInSAR and SBAS, were tested as tools for measuring coastal erosion. If successful it would have allowed for measuring coastal erosion {{as a function of}} material lost. The study area used was Ystad municipality, in southern Sweden. Radar data for the study was provided by the ESA, the European space agency, from their ERS- 2 and ENVISAT satellites, spanning the period 1998 - 2005. Unfortunately, even after many different configurations of settings were tested, the results indicated that both methods are very unsuited for use in rural areas such as Ystad, whether for measuring coastal erosion or otherwise. Both methods had severe problems achieving significant coverage after low <b>coherence</b> <b>areas</b> were masked out, and PSInSAR suffered from several anomalies. This is likely due to the highly vegetated nature of the landscape, which results in low coherence through temporal decorrelation. Of the two methods SBAS showed the most promise, but not nearly enough to be considereduseful. It is, based on the scientific literature, possible that simpler interferometry methods might have been more useful.

40|$|As a {{spectacular}} manifestation of self-interference effects in elastic light scattering, enhanced backscattering of light (EBS, {{also known as}} coherent backscattering of light) has been intensively investigated for characterization of strongly scattering medium. By using low spatial coherence illumination, EBS has further shown its potential for biological tissue characterization and cancer diagnosis. First, using low-coherence enhanced backscattering (hereafter referred to as LEBS), {{the development of an}} optical imaging platform is presented. LEBS imaging platform takes the advantage of self-generated multiple independent <b>coherence</b> <b>areas,</b> which can be used as spatial filters as similarly as mechanical pinhole scanning. Thus, this imaging platform substantially minimizes cross-talk among adjacent pixels, rejects the background light caused by out-of-plane scattered light, and allows optical-sectioning to the subsurface in a relatively large area. These interesting capabilities of the LEBS imaging platform are validated by tissue phantom experiments. Second, the presented work further describes a detailed analysis of LEBS for better understanding possible mechanisms by which LEBS probes subtle variations in radial intensity distribution in weakly scattering medium such as biological tissue. The result from a pilot study using an animal model of chemical skin carcinogenesis shows that the enhancement factor of LEBS can be strongly altered even at a stage of preneoplasia, preceding the classical biomarker of non-melanoma skin cancer. ...|$|R

Eleven healthy adults repeated the stepping exercise up to their individual endurance limits (RPE score reached 20), and the cross-correlation and coherence were assessed by surface electromyography (EMG) recordings. The coefficient and time lag of cross-correlation and the <b>coherence</b> <b>areas</b> in the alpha (8 &# 8211; 12 Hz), beta (15 &# 8211; 30 Hz), gamma (30 &# 8211; 60 Hz) and high-gamma (60 &# 8211; 150 Hz) bands among the three muscle pairs (RF-VM, RF-VL and VM-VL) were calculated. As muscle fatigue, RF-VM and VM-VL showed increases of coefficients and the shortening of time lags. RF-VM and RF-VL showed increases of beta-band coherence in the ascent and descent phases, respectively. The increased intermuscular cross-correlation and beta-band coherence may be a compensatory strategy for maintaining the coordination of knee synergistic muscles during fatigue due to the fatigue-related disturbance of the corticospinal transmission. Therefore, the intermuscular cross-correlation and beta-band coherence may be a potential index for assessing muscle fatigue and monitoring the central control of motor function during dynamic fatiguing exercise...|$|R

This distinction may yield insights into normal human perception, its development and pathology. Motion coherence sensitivity has been taken {{as a test of}} global processing in the dorsal stream [4, 5]. We have proposed an analogous ‘form coherence’ measure of global processing in the ventral stream [6]. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, we found that the cortical regions activated by form coherence did not overlap with those activated by motion coherence in the same individuals. Areas differentially activated by form coherence included regions in the middle occipital gyrus, the ventral occipital surface, the intraparietal sulcus, and the temporal lobe. Motion <b>coherence</b> activated <b>areas</b> consistent with those previously identified as V 5 and V 3 a, the ventral occipital surface, the intraparietal sulcus, and temporal structures.

The method relies on Fourier analysis of near field speckles generated by scattering from nanoparticles suspended in a liquid. A criterion based on master curves of power spectra is introduced and validated by measurements on the visible light produced by the ALBA bending dipole. While spatial coherence measurements with HNFS have been reported, we present {{for the first time}} measurements of the temporal coherence of SR wavefronts with the HNFS method both for narrowband and white light beams. In the former case, using a band-pass filter, a coherence time of 40 ± 10 [*][*]fs is measured, in good agreement with the expected value of 43  fs for the filter inverse linewidth. Moreover, by exploiting the self-reference scheme of the technique, we show that <b>coherence</b> <b>areas</b> propagate carrying nonvanishing curvature. In the latter case, the measured coherence time of the incident SR without any monochromator is 1. 6 ± 0. 4 [*][*]fs, corresponding to a bandwidth of 240  nm at a peak wavelength of 350  nm.

Our measurements demonstrate the violation, at macroscopic intensities, of each of these inequalities. We show that their violation, although weak, can be demonstrated through photodetector current covariance measurements on correlated sub-Poissonian Poissonian, and super Poissonian light beams. Such beams are readily generated by a tandem array of infrared-emitting semiconductor junction diodes. Our measurements utilize an electrically coupled array of one or more infrared-emitting diodes, optically coupled to a detector array. The emitting array is operated in such a way as to generate highly correlated beams of variable photon Fano Factor. Because the measurements are made on time scales long compared with the first order coherence time and with detector areas large compared with the corresponding <b>coherence</b> <b>areas,</b> first order interference effects are negligible. The first and second inequalities are violated, as expected, when a sub-Poissonian light beam is split and the intensity fluctuations of the two split beams are measured by two photodetectors and subsequently cross-correlated. The third inequality is violated by bunched (as well as anti-bunched) beams of equal intensity provided the measured cross correlation coefficient exceeds (F - 1) /F, where F is the measured Fano Factor of each beam.
