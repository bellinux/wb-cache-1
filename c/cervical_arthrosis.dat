40|$|Seventy-eight patients, 40 {{suffering}} from <b>cervical</b> <b>arthrosis</b> and 38 from lumbar arthrosis, received {{for a period}} of two weeks paracetamol or a new preparation of glaphenine, in a double blind study. The two drugs were found to have the same efficiency on the subjective parameters but high bioavailability glaphenine seems to have an effectiveness in the range of articulatory movements, which is not found with paracetamol. The side effects were quite equivalent. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} described {{a number of}} oto- neurological abnormalities in patients with dizziness and headache even without organic changes on the central nervous system. In order to validate these data, we have added {{to the number of}} cases nd have introduced a new ENG test, the pursuit test, to study the activity of oculomotor centers. Again we evaluated the influence of <b>cervical</b> <b>arthrosis</b> on pathgenesis of migraine by cervical nystagmous test. Finally we used a beta-blocker and a calcium- anatgonist to record the influence of these drugs on ENG parameters...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{cause of}} brachioradial {{pruritus}} (a localized itching {{on the arms}} or shoulders) is controversial. The role of sun and cervical spine disease has been discussed. This is a report on four sisters suffering from brachioradial pruritus recurring every summer. The sisters spent much time outdoors and exposed themselves extensively to the sun. They also had occupations requiring heavy lifting. Cervical radiographs indicated arthrosis. The density of sensory nerve fibers in the skin biopsies from the itchy skin of the arms, visualized by antibodies against a pan-neuronal marker, protein gene product 9. 5, was reduced compared with biopsies from the same skin region during the symptom-free period in the winter. This data exemplifies that brachioradial pruritus is a self healing photoneuropathy occurring in middle aged adults predisposed by <b>cervical</b> <b>arthrosis.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that depression in patients being considered for cervical disc surgery is associated with severe organic pathology. Secondly, to test whether depression and abnormal illness attitudes recorded preoperatively would predict poorer recovery.  METHODS—Seventy four patients with pain and disability from <b>cervical</b> <b>arthrosis</b> were examined during investigations before potential cervical surgery. The prevalence of psychiatric disorder was assessed using the SCAN, and attitude to illness using the illness attitude scale.  RESULTS—There was a rate of depressive disorder in the sample of 37 %. The depressed patients did not have more severe organic pathology, more neurological symptoms or signs, or more disablement. They reported more pain and displayed more abnormal illness behaviour. Fifty patients went on to cervical surgery. Outcome four to eight months postoperatively {{was not related to}} the presence of psychiatric disorder or illness attitude recorded preoperatively.  CONCLUSION—Depressive disorder is not secondary to severe pathology; the outcome of surgery is predominantly determined by physical factors. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Recognizing the {{importance}} of SCIWORA in adult age; analyze the usefulness of complementary studies; evaluating therapeutic options; learn about {{the evolution of the}} treated patients. METHODS: A prospective evaluation with a minimum follow-up of 5 years, eight elderly patients with <b>cervical</b> <b>arthrosis</b> and diagnosis of SCIWORA. The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scale and ASIA were used on admission and at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months. RESULTS: The central cord syndrome (CCS) was the neurological condition at admission. One patient recovered after corticosteroid therapy, but later, his disability worsened, and he was operated at 18 months, another patient recovered and a third died. The other patients underwent laminoplasty in the first 72 hours; patients with partial severity condition had a minimum improvement of five points in JAO scale and those with severe conditions died. CONCLUSIONS: The low-energy trauma can decompensate the relationship between container and content in the spine with asymptomatic arthrosis, and can be devastating to the patient. The diagnosis of intramedullary lesion is made by magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with incomplete deficit undergoing laminoplasty reached at least one level in ASIA score. The potential postoperative complications can be serious. </sec...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{review the}} {{clinical}} features, electronystagmography findings, the possible mechanism, {{and a possible}} therapeutic approach to {{benign paroxysmal positional vertigo}} (BPPV). METHODS [...] Sixty-three cases of BPPV of the horizontal canal type have been reviewed. It is characterised by horizontal nystagmus and an intense vertigo, provoked by rotation of the head in a supine patient. The horizontal nystagmus beats towards the ground on both sides, becomes more pronounced when lying on the pathological side, and then the nystagmus often changes direction. RESULTS [...] Forty-eight patients underwent electronystagmography. On the pathological side, the first phase nystagmus had a mean latency of three seconds and a mean duration of 31. 6 seconds. Nystagmus inversion occurred in 36 patients after a nystagmus free interval. The mean second phase nystagmus duration lasted 33. 4 seconds. On the healthy side, the nystagmus had a mean latency of 3. 4 seconds and a mean duration of 39. 5 seconds. Fatigue was seen in six patients. Simultaneous involvement of the posterior canal was present in 16 patients. A liberatory manoeuvre was successful in six patients. CONCLUSIONS [...] The liberatory manoeuvre should be tried in patients with horizontal canal vertigo. It should not be performed in patients with severe <b>cervical</b> <b>arthrosis,</b> vertebrobasilar insufficiency, or when the patient has neck pain during the manoeuvre...|$|E
