Foraging is regulated using positive and negative feedback loops. Ants returning to the colony stimulates outgoing foraging. When ants return to the colony at a higher rate with seeds, this in turn causes the outgoing rate of foragers to increase. As fewer ants bearing seeds return to the colony, the rate of outgoing foragers decreases. The result is foraging regulation relative to the abundance of available food at any given time. The interactions between returning and outgoing foragers operates on a timescale of seconds. It typically only took three to eight seconds for an outgoing forager to leave the nest {{as a result of an}} increase in successful returning foragers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Smart grid is an {{emerging}} cyber-physical system which aims at making power systems more intelligent and efficient. One {{of the major}} attributes of smart grid is integration of distributed renewable power resources into the traditional power grid. As a result, traditional centralized control is not always effective in smart grid, and distributed control is essential for flexible energy management. To facilitate distributed con-trol, Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), which are embedded computers equipped on power devices, are interconnected based on the peer-to-peer communication model. An open question is whether such a distributed control mechanism over peer to peer communication is delay-efficient to support time-critical smart grid applications. To answer this question, we establish a micro smart grid, called Green Hub, to measure the delay performance for both distributed and centralized control systems. Our results show that, for computationally intensive applications, the delay performance of the distributed system is worse {{than that of the}} <b>centralized</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> mostly due to IEDs’ limited capability. In addition, we find that in distributed control systems, the peer to peer communication may cause different behaviors of physical devices in power systems, and consequently deviates their decisions from optimal. Our experimental study reveals the distributed control system in smart grid does not necessarily performs better than the <b>centralized</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> for certain applications, and the peer to peer communication in the distributed control system may bring new concerns which did not exist in the <b>centralized</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> A special attention need to be paid on the effectiveness and efficiency aspects when design algorithms/schemes for smart grid.

40|$|<b>Centralized</b> {{semi-active}} <b>control</b> is {{a technique}} for controlling the whole structure using one main computer. <b>Centralized</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> introduce better <b>control</b> for relatively short to medium high structures where the response of any story cannot {{be separated from the}} adjacent ones. In this paper, two <b>centralized</b> <b>control</b> approaches are proposed for controlling the seismic response of post-tensioned (PT) steel frames. The first approach, the stiffness control approach, aims to alter the stiffness of the PT frame so that it avoids large dynamic amplifications due to earthquake excitations. The second approach, deformation regulation control approach, aims at redistributing the demand/strength ratio in order to provide a more uniform distribution of deformations over the height of the structure. The two control approaches were assessed through simulations of the earthquake response of semi-actively and passively controlled six-story post-tensioned steel frames. The results showed that the stiffness control approach is efficient in reducing the frame deformations and internal forces. The deformation regulation control approach was found to be efficient in reducing the frame displacements and generating a more uniform distribution of the inter-story drifts. These results indicate that <b>centralized</b> semi-active <b>control</b> can be used to improve the seismic performance of post-tensioned steel frames...|$|R
