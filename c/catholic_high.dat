40|$|American <b>Catholic</b> <b>higher</b> {{education}} has faced and overcome challenges, both from American {{higher education and}} Vatican Church officials, in its long and rich history. Georgetown College’s founding in 1789 {{was the first of}} several <b>Catholic</b> <b>higher</b> education institutions created in the late 18 th and early 19 th centuries. The 20 th century brought the challenges of accrediting agencies and mixed communi-cation with The Vatican, including Pope John Paul II’s (1990) Ex Corde Ecclesiae. This document attempts to clarify the nature of a Catholic institution’s identity. American <b>Catholic</b> <b>higher</b> {{education has}} a rich tradition distinct fromother denominations. <b>Catholic</b> <b>higher</b> education takes shape in numer-ous institutions, has traditionally been independent from Church authorities in governance, finances, and intellectual initiative, and was slow to accept coeducation (Burtchaell, 1998). <b>Catholic</b> <b>higher</b> education’s initial purpose was to prepare future clergy. This evolved into educating the Catholic laity and to its current secular structure. Today’s Catholic colleges differ in governance, mission, and students. Scholars are debating whether Catholic universities are losing their identity. Rittof (2001) describes the concept of Catholic identity as the most “preva-lent and dominant ” (p. 1) issue in American <b>Catholic</b> <b>higher</b> education. This article will provide a historical overview of American <b>Catholic</b> <b>higher</b> education, including a chronological account of important related Church documents. The article will also provide a literature review on how a Catholic institution’s identity is defined...|$|R
