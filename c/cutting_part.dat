2500|$|Guns N' Roses headlined the Friday {{night at}} Reading Festival 2010 and closed Leeds Festival two days later. Guns N' Roses was 58 minutes late {{coming on to}} the stage, and because of a curfew issued by Reading Council the band's set ended at midnight. The band was {{therefore}} not able to complete its set, but nevertheless attempted to play [...] "Paradise City" [...] without amplification while the audience sang along. Rose orchestrated fan frustration toward the organizers, telling fans that the group would not play at the Leeds Festival. However, two days later the band played the final night of the Leeds Festival, coming onto stage 30 minutes late, and <b>cutting</b> <b>part</b> of the encore, with Rose stating to the crowd, [...] "We come here to play for you but the cops and the promoters wanna fuck us in the ass. We would like to play a few more songs for you but we'll just play one." [...] During a concert on September 1, in Dublin, the band was over an hour late arriving on stage. Rose stopped the band {{in the middle of}} the second song, [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] after multiple bottles were thrown on stage, warning the crowd [...] "One more bottle and we go home. It's up to you. We would like to stay. We want to stay. We want to have some fun." [...] After another bottle was thrown, the band left the stage during the fourth song of the set. The band returned to the stage an hour later to finish the show.|$|E

60|$|This was true. What {{are called}} cut-nails, {{are made by}} machinery. They are cut from flat-bars or plates of iron, almost red-hot, by a massive and {{ponderous}} engine carried by water.

It composed of mechanical, hydraulic, electrical and control systems, and covered cutting, shipment and travelling. Because of its hard working conditions, the complex cutting force and load fluctuation and vibration during the working process, the mechanical parts design plays very important roll to the EBH 300 Roadheader. The 3 D models of the EBH 300 Roadheader were built based on the engineering prototype. The mechanical characteristics were studied for further development, which included mechanical structure, the vibration modes of the <b>cutting</b> <b>parts,</b> maximum amplitudes by modal analysis. According to the result, more attention must be paid to the complex force condition, violent and irregular vibration of the <b>cutting</b> <b>parts</b> in the design...|$|R

6000|$|... [8] Remains of the dingo {{have been}} found fossil in Pleistocene {{deposits}} but the antiquity of man in Australia is not known. It is not, however, improbable {{that it may be}} as great as in Europe. My friend A. C. Swinton, Esq., while working in the then almost unknown gold-field of Maryborough, Victoria, in January, 1855, found a fragment of a well-formed stone axe resting on the metamorphic schistose bed-rock about five feet beneath the surface. It was overlain by the compact gravel drift called by the miners [...] "cement," [...] and by an included layer of hard iron-stained sandstone. The fragment is about an inch and three-eighths wide and the same length, and is of very hard fine-grained black basalt. One side is ground to a very smooth and regular surface, terminating in a well-formed cutting edge more than an inch long, the return face of the <b>cutting</b> <b>part</b> being about a quarter of an inch wide. The other side is a broken surface. The weapon appears to have been an axe or tomahawk closely resembling that figured at p. 335 of Lumholtz's Among Cannibals, from Central Queensland. The fragment was discovered by Mr. Swinton and the late Mr. Mackworth Shore, one of the discoverers of the gold-field, before any rush to it had taken place, and it seems impossible to avoid the conclusion that it was formed prior to the deposit of the gravel drift and iron-stained sandstone under which it lay. This would indicate a great antiquity of man in Australia, and would enable us to account for the fossilised remains of the dingo in Pleistocene deposits as those of an animal introduced by man.|$|E
60|$|I {{took up the}} axe {{and closely}} {{examined}} this formidable weapon. It was, as I have said, {{of the nature of}} a pole-axe. The haft, made out of an enormous rhinoceros horn, was three feet three inches long, about an inch and a quarter thick, and with a knob at the end as large as a Maltese orange, left there to prevent the hand from slipping. This horn haft, though so massive, was as flexible as cane, and practically unbreakable; but, to make assurance doubly sure, it was whipped round at intervals of a few inches with copper wire -- all the parts where the hands grip being thus treated. Just above where the haft entered the head were scored a number of little nicks, each nick representing a man killed in battle with the weapon. The axe itself was made of the most beautiful steel, and apparently of European manufacture, though Umslopogaas did not know where it came from, having taken it from the hand of a chief he had killed in battle many years before. It was not very heavy, the head weighing two and a half pounds, as nearly as I could judge. The <b>cutting</b> <b>part</b> was slightly concave in shape -- not convex, as it generally the case with savage battleaxes -- and sharp as a razor, measuring five and three-quarter inches across the widest part. From the back of the axe sprang a stout spike four inches long, for the last two of which it was hollow, and shaped like a leather punch, with an opening for anything forced into the hollow at the punch end to be pushed out above -- in fact, in this respect it exactly resembled a butcher's pole-axe. It was with this punch end, as we afterwards discovered, that Umslopogaas usually struck when fighting, driving a neat round hole in his adversary's skull, and only using the broad cutting edge for a circular sweep, or sometimes in a melee. I think he considered the punch a neater and more sportsmanlike tool, and it was from his habit of pecking at his enemy with it that he got his name of 'Woodpecker'. Certainly in his hands it was a terribly efficient one.|$|E
