25|$|The V-1 was {{transformed}} into the Reichenberg by adding a small, cramped cockpit {{at the point of}} the fuselage that was immediately ahead of the pulsejet's intake, where the standard V-1's <b>compressed-air</b> <b>cylinders</b> were fitted. The cockpit had basic flight instruments and a plywood bucket seat. The single-piece canopy incorporated an armoured front panel and opened to the side to allow entry. The two displaced <b>compressed-air</b> <b>cylinders</b> were replaced by a single one, fitted in the rear in the space which normally accommodated the V-1's autopilot. The wings were fitted with hardened edges to cut the cables of barrage balloons. The broader-chord forward support pylon for the Argus pulsejet, by co-incidence, resembles the same airframe component used on the American clone of the unmanned V-1, the Republic-Ford JB-2 Loon.|$|E
50|$|The pistol uses dehumidified {{compressed}} air as propellant for the diabolo air gun pellets. This {{is stored in}} <b>compressed-air</b> <b>cylinders</b> that have a maximum filling pressure of 200 bar and built-in pressure gauges that indicate the current pressure level in the cylinder. The air for actual shooting is drawn from the compressed-air storage cylinder and reduced by a reduction valve to the pistols working pressure of about 55 bar. According to Steyr their <b>compressed-air</b> <b>cylinders</b> have a storage capacity for about 180 shots.|$|E
50|$|From 1989 to 2004, the SEFA {{backpack}} SCBA was made. Rescuers used {{it and its}} successors the Draeger rebreather and Biomarine. Narrow {{spaces in}} mines are often too constricted for bulky open circuit sets with big <b>compressed-air</b> <b>cylinders.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Fernez had {{previously}} invented the noseclip, a mouthpiece (equipped with a one-way valve for exhalation) and diving goggles, and Yves le Prieur just joined to those three Fernez elements a hand-controlled regulator and a <b>compressed-air</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Fernez's goggles didn't allow a dive deeper than ten metres due to [...] "mask squeeze", so, in 1933, Le Prieur replaced all the Fernez equipment (goggles, noseclip and valve) by a full face mask, directly supplied with constant flow {{air from the}} cylinder.|$|R
2500|$|Le Prieur's {{design was}} the first {{autonomous}} breathing device used by the first scuba diving clubs in history - Racleurs de fond founded by Glenn Orr in California in 1933, and Club des sous-l'eau founded by Le Prieur himself in Paris in 1935.

50|$|The design drew upon {{experience}} with the Valentine tank prototypes. Fuel and pressure for the flamethower was carried in a trailer with 0.47 in of armour {{and as a result}} weighing about 6.4 LT. The trailer held two fuel tanks with a capacity of 400 gal L and five <b>compressed-air</b> <b>cylinders</b> plus some ancillary piping and a hand pump for filling. The trailer had two wheels fitted with run-flat tyres but no shock absorbers nor brakes.|$|E
50|$|The rifle uses dehumidified {{compressed}} air as propellant for the diabolo air gun pellets. This {{is stored in}} <b>compressed-air</b> <b>cylinders</b> that have a maximum filling pressure of 300 bar and built-in pressure gauges that indicate the current pressure level in the cylinder. The air for actual shooting is drawn from the compressed-air storage cylinder and reduced by a reduction valve into a secondary or output pressure chamber to the rifles working pressure of about 72 bar for staying within the 7.5 joule muzzle energy limit.|$|E
