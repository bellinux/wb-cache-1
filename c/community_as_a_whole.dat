5|$|Despite being {{appointed}} by agreement of national governments acting together, the members were to {{pledge not to}} represent their national interest, but rather took an oath to defend the general interests of the <b>Community</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> Their independence was aided by members being barred from having any occupation outside the Authority or having any business interests (paid or unpaid) during their tenure and for three years after they left office. To further ensure impartiality, {{one third of the}} membership was to be renewed every two years (article 10).|$|E
5|$|The {{group of}} animals most {{integral}} to the overall success of Everglades wildlife is freshwater fish. Few places in the Everglades stay submerged {{from one year to}} the next, so alligator holes and deep clefts in the limestone are vital to the survival of fish, and the animal <b>community</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> Freshwater fish are the main diet of most wading birds, alligators, and otters, and require large areas of open water in order to repopulate. Young amphibians also {{play an important role in}} the food chain. Tadpoles spread quickly in isolated areas where fish do not have the time or access to reproduce in numbers necessary to support larger animals. Hundreds of species of amphibians are found in the Everglades, and their availability helps support wildlife during short hydroperiods or in remote locations.|$|E

5|$|Comparative {{analyses}} between metagenomes {{can provide}} additional {{insight into the}} function of complex microbial communities and their role in host health. Pairwise or multiple comparisons between metagenomes can be made {{at the level of}} sequence composition (comparing GC-content or genome size), taxonomic diversity, or functional complement. Comparisons of population structure and phylogenetic diversity can be {{made on the basis of}} 16S and other phylogenetic marker genes, or—in the case of low-diversity communities—by genome reconstruction from the metagenomic dataset. Functional comparisons between metagenomes may be made by comparing sequences against reference databases such as COG or KEGG, and tabulating the abundance by category and evaluating any differences for statistical significance. This gene-centric approach emphasizes the functional complement of the <b>community</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> rather than taxonomic groups, and shows that the functional complements are analogous under similar environmental conditions. Consequently, metadata on the environmental context of the metagenomic sample is especially important in comparative analyses, as it provides researchers with the ability to study the effect of habitat upon community structure and function.|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{adaptive capacity}} to floods. We employ {{a case study}} method with two units of analysis comprising the villages of Shankarpur and Murgahawa, located in a flood prone area by a branch of Nepal’s largest river, Karnali. Our study describes the response cycle that the residents of these communities employ; their strategies to adapt to, cope with, and recover from floods. We analyse how these activities are steered by what we see as the central parts of adaptive capacity, access to resources and social learning. Finally, our study identifies a set of social factors that limit the adaptive capacity of individuals and the <b>communities</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> We conclude that the persisting unequal power relations limit the adaptive capacity of marginalized social groups and impede women from learning crucial skills. Weak social relations hinder the process of social learning. These factors have a negative influence not only on individuals {{but also on the}} adaptive capacity of the <b>communities</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} phases bones of {{numerous}} bodies are often found together {{and it has}} been argued that this suggests that in death at least, the status of individuals was played down.

40|$|Antagonistic {{interactions}} between insect herbivores and plants impose selection on plants {{to defend themselves}} against these attackers.
