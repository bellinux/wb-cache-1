50|$|Sensory {{hearing loss}} {{is caused by}} {{abnormal}} structure or function of the hair cells of the organ of Corti in the cochlea. Neural hearing impairments are consequent upon damage to the eighth cranial nerve (the vestibulocochlear nerve) or the auditory tracts of the brainstem. If higher levels of the auditory tract are affected {{this is known as}} <b>central</b> <b>deafness.</b> <b>Central</b> <b>deafness</b> may present as sensorineural deafness but should be distinguishable from the history and audiological testing.|$|E
50|$|Damage to {{the brain}} {{can lead to a}} <b>central</b> <b>deafness.</b> The {{peripheral}} ear and the auditory nerve may function well but the central connections are damaged by tumour, trauma or other disease and the patient is unable to hear.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} main types of hearing loss, {{conductive}} hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, <b>central</b> <b>deafness</b> and combinations of conductive and sensorienural hearing losses {{which is called}} mixed hearing loss. An additional problem which is increasingly recognised is auditory processing disorder {{which is not a}} hearing loss as such but a difficulty perceiving sound.|$|E
40|$|Physiological {{measures}} of neural {{activity in the}} auditory cortex have revealed plasticity following unilateral <b>deafness.</b> <b>Central</b> projections from the remaining ear reorganize to produce a stronger cortical response than normal. However, {{little is known about}} the perceptual consequences of this increase. One possibility is improved sound intensity discrimination. Intensity difference limens were measured in 11 individuals with unilateral deafness that were previously shown to exhibit increased cortical activity to sounds heard by the intact ear. Significantly smaller mean difference limens were observed compared with controls. These results provide evidence of the perceptual consequences of plasticity in humans following unilateral deafness...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{known as}} <b>central</b> <b>deafness</b> is a disability which is puzzling to researchers. The name itself is confusing, because <b>central</b> <b>deafness</b> does not cause a loss of hearing acuity; pure tone tests, conventional speech results, and site of lesion tests all fall within normal limits. The situation is complicated further {{by the fact that}} very {{little is known about the}} incidence of <b>central</b> <b>deafness</b> in the general population (Matkin and Olsen, 1971). It has not been determined whether this lack of knowledge is due to the fact that <b>central</b> <b>deafness</b> is an extremely rare phenomenon involving a minimal proportion of the population, or to the fact that, in the past, very few tests designed to identify persons with central lesions have been available to the audiologist. It has been only within the past twenty years that tests for central auditory functioning and abilities have been developed. Authorities claim that the tests which most effectively identify central auditory impairments are reduced redundancy tests (Bocca and Calearo, 1963) and competing message tests (Katz, 1968). Because of the previous unavailability of tests suitable for identifying central lesions, it is presently unknown whether <b>central</b> <b>deafness</b> is a disability occurring only one time in a million, or whether it is a rather common problem that has remained unnoticed and undiagnosed. It also remains to be determined exactly what effect the presence of <b>central</b> <b>deafness</b> may have on the over-all functioning of an individual. The effects of <b>central</b> <b>deafness,</b> if it is a rather common problem, could be particularly disruptive in a young, school-age child. The disability could result in school performance which would indicate that the child was low in achievement, and therefore, in many cases, low in aptitude, even though the problem was caused by a factor which was definitely not related to intelligence. In view of these problems, it is important to determine the presence or absence of central auditory impairment in school children. It is the purpose of this study to determine the rate of <b>central</b> <b>deafness</b> in high and low achieving students. The Flowers-Costello Tests of Central Auditory Abilities, containing both reduced redundancy (low pass filtered speech) and competing message tests, will be administered to ten high achieving and ten low achieving (as determined by the Iowa Tests of Basic Achievement) students enrolled in third grade at a public school. The subjects will also receive a non-language based intelligence test, the Leiter International Performance Scale. Results will be analyzed by mean, standard deviation, correlation coefficient, and 't' tests as specified in the Procedures chapter of this study. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the performance of young elementary children with differing auditory language abilities on tests of central auditory functioning (<b>central</b> <b>deafness).</b> Language abilities were based on the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA) and Slosson Oral Reading Test (SORT) level vs. Reading Expectancy level performances. Group A, the control group, scored in the normal range on both the ITPA and the SORT. Groups B and C were both deficient in reading skills by at least one year. The difference between these groups was their ITPA performance. Group C displayed average ITPA profiles while Group B scored significantly lower in auditory skills. Four <b>central</b> <b>deafness</b> tests designed by Willeford and the Sound Mimicry Test of the Goldman-Fristoe-Woodcock Auditory Skills Test Battery were administered to all subjects. A One Way Analysis of Variance was used to analyze differences in performance between groups on all test variables. Pearson Correlation Coefficients were used to study relationships between the ITPA and the <b>central</b> <b>deafness</b> tests and the Sound Mimicry Test. Group B, subjects with poor ITPAauditory subtest scores, also scored significantly lower on two of the <b>central</b> <b>deafness</b> tests. Group C scored significantly lower than the control group only on the Sound Mimicry Test. Great disparity among individual scores within groups detracts from possible conclusions to be drawn from this study. It appears, however, that the two <b>central</b> <b>deafness</b> tests designed to assess brainstem integrity (Binaural Fusion and Alternating Speech) correlate with performances on the ITPA auditory subtests. Scores on the ITPA Auditory Memory subtest appear to correlate with the Sound Mimicry Test suggesting that these subjects experience difficulty with temporal order sequencing tasks. A larger testing population would be necessary to substantiate trends noted in this research. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To assess {{universal}} {{neonatal screening}} for bilateral hearing impairments averaging 40 dBHL or {{worse in the}} better ear, using transient evoked otoacoustic emission screening (TEOAE) testing. METHODS: A three year cohort (14, 353 infants born from January 1992 to 1995) was screened and subsequently followed up by hearing surveillance methods, including a distraction test screen from 7 months of age. The entire cohort {{was used to evaluate}} the outcome of the screen. A subcohort of 8172 district residents was used to evaluate the continuing worth of the distraction test programme. RESULTS: Nineteen infants (1. 3 / 1000) with a targeted hearing impairment failed the neonatal TEOAE test. Six profoundly deaf infants identified by the TEOAE screen, were fitted with hearing aids at a median age of 16 weeks. One remained without an aid. Of 12 infants with a moderate impairment, only seven accepted hearing aid fitting and the median age of being fitted with an aid increased to 42 weeks. By the time of the analysis 22 children with a targeted hearing impairment (1. 5 / 1000) had been identified from the cohort. Of the three missed neonatally, one was cared for elsewhere, another had a progressive loss, and the third had <b>central</b> <b>deafness.</b> Twenty children were ascertained with a congenital peripheral deafness. Of these, eight (40 %) had risk factors identifiable neonatally. Only the child with <b>central</b> <b>deafness</b> was missed by TEOAE screening and subsequently identified by behavioural tests in infancy. The TEOAE screen outperformed the distraction test in terms of processes and yield and was 25 % less expensive. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis confirmed the worth within the district of the TEOAE hearing screen. It will thus be continued as a universal neonatal screen with the distraction test being retained as a selective screen {{in the latter half of}} infancy...|$|E
40|$|Crigler-Najjar Syndrome is an {{uncommon}} genetic disorder {{characterized by the}} elevation of unconjugated plasmatic bilirubin secondary to deficiency of the enzyme uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UDP-GT). We report a 19 -years-old woman with the syndrome diagnosed during the neonatal period, when she developed a severe jaundice in the first 10 days of life, reaching unconjugated bilirubin levels of 29 mg/dl, with normal liver function tests. After transient response to phototherapy, the patient was referred to a tertiary medical center in which an extensive work up ruled out other etiologies and the diagnosis of type I Crigler-Najjar syndrome was established. Currently, the patient has a mild mental retardation. She is receiving homemade phototherapy 18 h per day with acceptable control of bilirubin levels. Many mutations {{have been associated with}} UDP-GT dysfunction resulting in a broad spectrum of the disease. When bilirubin rises above physiological limits, it permeates the hematoencephalic barrier, inducing bilirubin impregnation of basal ganglia with secondary neuronal damage and necrosis. The worst outcome, kernicterus, is characterized by mental retardation, <b>central</b> <b>deafness,</b> ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, athetosis, spasticity, seizures and death. First line therapy includes phototherapy, but definitive therapy is liver transplantation before the occurrence of neurological damage...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Labyrinthectomized rats are {{suitable}} models to test consequences of vestibular lesion and {{are widely used}} to study neural plasticity. We describe a combined microsurgical–chemical technique that can be routinely performed with minimum damage. Methods Caudal leaflet of the parotis is elevated. The tendinous fascia covering the bulla is opened frontally from the sternomastoid muscle’s tendon while sparing facial nerve branches. A 4  mm diameter hole is drilled into the bulla’s hind lower lateral wall to open the common (in rodents) mastoid-tympanic cavity. The cochlear crista (promontory) at the lower posterior part of its medial wall is identified as a bony prominence. A 1  mm diameter hole is drilled into its lower part. The perilymphatic/endolymphatic fluids with tissue debris of the Corti organ are suctioned. Ethanol is injected into the hole. Finally, 10  µL of sodium arsenite solution (50  µM/mL) is pumped into the labyrinth and left in place for 15  min. Simple closure in two layers (fascia and skin) is sufficient. Results and conclusion All rats had neurological symptoms specific for labyrinthectomy (muscle tone, body position, rotatory movements, nystagmus, <b>central</b> <b>deafness).</b> Otherwise, their behavior was unaffected, drinking and eating normally. After a few days, they learned to balance relying on visual and somatic stimuli (neuroplasticity) ...|$|E
40|$|Type 1 nephronophthisis (NPHP) with {{homozygous}} deletions of nephrocystin [NPHP 1, DEL] {{has been}} considered a pure renal disorder, but co-occurrence of extrarenal symptoms, mainly retinitis pigmentosa, is observed in a subset of patients. Recently, [NPHP 1, DEL] has been detected in three patients with Joubert syndrome-related disorders (JSRDs), who associated neurological signs with a peculiar neuroradiological malformation known as the ‘molar tooth sign’ (MTS). To define the frequency of JSRD spectrum in NPHP 1 patients, we re-examined 56 cases with [NPHP 1, DEL] and found an overall incidence of 8. 9 % (five out 56 patients). All had small hyperechoic kidneys and had developed advanced renal failure within 15 years. Two patients presented the complete features of JSRD with cerebello-renal-retinal association and MTS. Two others showed, instead, severe intentional tremor and thick superior cerebellar peduncles on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), {{and one of them}} had associated retinopathy. The fifth patient presented with hypotonia, developmental delay, <b>central</b> <b>deafness,</b> and ataxia associated with Leber congenital amaurosis and liver fibrosis but with normal brain MRI. Marked intrafamilial variability of associated extrarenal symptoms was observed in familial cases. Deletion extension did not differ in patients with isolated renal phenotype and in those with associated neurological symptoms. In conclusion, neurological defects varying from subtle involvement of cerebellum with thickened peduncle to both JSRD and diffuse central hypotonia are frequent in [NPHP 1, DEL] patients. Prevalence of such association may justify systematic neurological and neuroradiological evaluation...|$|E
