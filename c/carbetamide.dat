40|$|The {{validation}} of analytical procedures using added samples as reference materials is proposed. The <b>carbetamide</b> extracted with dichloromethane is monitored by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography with a retention time of some 2. 7 min. while Carbaryl {{is used as}} an internal standard. The accuracy of the method is checked analysing water samples previously spiked with different amounts of analyte. A method to obtain the signal associated to a chromatographic blank is presented, to include as another precaution, within the calibration procedures. The method {{was applied to the}} determination of <b>carbetamide</b> at very low concentration levels (2. 50 – 10. 0 µg · L − 1) in different types of natural water samples. The detection limit (DL) was 0. 02 µg · L − 1. Around 100 % recovery levels were customarily obtained in all cases...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{adsorption}} of low polarity pesticides <b>Carbetamide</b> and Metamitron on hydrotalcite [Mg 3 Al(OH) 8] 2 CO 3 ·nH 2 O and organohydrotalcites [Mg 3 Al(OH) 8] 2 DDS·nH 2 O with different degree of dodecyl sulphate (DDS) saturation. The adsorbents and the adsorption products were characterized by X-ray diffraction method and FT-IR spectroscopy. Both pesticides were better adsorbed on organohydrotalcite with higher DDS saturation, while their adsorption on inorganic hydrotalcite was very low. The {{results indicate that the}} adsorption capacity of different materials depends on their nature as well as structure and polarity of the pesticides and suggest the possibility of use of organohydrotalcite to uptake the <b>Carbetamide</b> and Metamitron from contaminated waters. The results also showed that the recyclability of organohydrotalcite and their reutilization as adsorbent is possible.

40|$|Cycling {{pesticides}} {{has been}} proposed {{as a means of}} retarding the evolution of resistance, but its efficacy has rarely been empirically tested. We evolved populations of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the presence of three herbicides: atrazine, glyphosate and <b>carbetamide.</b> Populations were exposed to a weekly, biweekly and triweekly cycling between all three pairwise combinations of herbicides and continuously to each of the three herbicides. We explored the impacts of herbicide cycling on the rate of resistance evolution, the level of resistance selected, the cost of resistance and the degree of generality (cross-resistance) observed. Herbicide cycling resulted in a diversity of outcomes: preventing evolution of resistance for some combinations of herbicides, having no impacts for others and increasing rates of resistance evolution in some instances. Weekly cycling of atrazine and <b>carbetamide</b> resulted in selection of a generalist population. This population had a higher level of resistance, and this generalist resistance was associated with a cost. The level of resistance selected did not vary amongst other regimes. Costs of resistance were generally highest when cycling was more frequent. Our data suggest that the effects of herbicide cycling on the evolution of resistance may be more complex and less favourable than generally assumed...|$|E
30|$|Highly powerful, {{economically}} {{method is}} the photocatalytic oxidation of cyanide, {{which has been}} demonstrated in several studies[10 – 17]. However, an inexpensive photocatalyst is needed for the economical removal of large quantities of cyanide. ZnO {{is one of the}} most promising materials for executing this task, as an alternative to the widely used, relatively expensive titania (TiO 2). Although researchers recognized comparable photodegradation mechanisms with both ZnO and TiO 2, they proved that ZnO was the superior photocatalyst in degrading pesticide <b>carbetamide,</b> herbicide triclopyr, pulp mill bleaching wastewater, 2 -phenylphenol, phenol, blue 19, and acid red 14. This superiority of ZnO photocatalytic activity is because it has more active sites, higher reaction rates, and is more effective in generating hydrogen peroxide[18].|$|E
40|$|Yellow bristle grass (Setaria pumila) is a summer-growing annual grass {{currently}} expanding in distribution throughout pastures in Waikato. Readily grazed in {{its early}} vegetative growth stage, it is avoided by animals when the seed heads appear as barbed bristles lead to animal health problems, particularly around the mouth. Three field trials were conducted with several herbicides for control of yellow bristle grass. Since yellow bristle grass germinates {{over an extended period}} from November to February, the best control that could be achieved from a single herbicide application was 70 % by 2, 2 -DPA alone or in combination with either TCA or <b>carbetamide,</b> applied in December. MSMA was more effective on larger plants. Ethofumesate treatment resulted in poor control of yellow bristle grass and severe damage to white clover (Trifolium repens). All herbicides evaluated resulted in variable levels of damage to perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) ...|$|E
40|$|Pesticide {{pollution}} of surface {{water is a}} major concern in many agricultural catchments The development of rapid and accurate methods for determining pesticide concentrations in water samples is, therefore, important. Here we describe a method for the simultaneous analysis of six pesticides (metaldehyde, quinmerac, <b>carbetamide,</b> metazachlor, propyzamide and pendimethalin) in natural waters by direct aqueous injection with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method validation showed good linearity from 0. 2 to 50. 0 µg/L with correlation coefficients between 0. 995 and 0. 999. Method accuracy ranged from 84 to 100 % and precision Relative standard deviation (RSD) from 4 to 15 %. The limits of detection for the targeted pesticides ranged from 0. 03 to 0. 36 µg/L. No significant matrix effects on quantification were observed (t-test). The method was tested on water samples from a small arable catchment in eastern England. Peak concentrations for the determinands ranged from 1 to 10 µg/L...|$|E
40|$|In rapidly {{changing}} environments, selection history may impact {{the dynamics of}} adaptation. Mutations selected in one environment may result in pleiotropic fitness trade-offs in subsequent novel environments, slowing the rates of adaptation. Epistatic interactions between mutations selected in sequential stressful environments may slow or accelerate subsequent rates of adaptation, depending {{on the nature of}} that interaction. We explored the dynamics of adaptation during sequential exposure to herbicides with different modes of action in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Evolution of resistance to two of the herbicides was largely independent of selection history. For <b>carbetamide,</b> previous adaptation to other herbicide modes of action positively impacted the likelihood of adaptation to this herbicide. Furthermore, while adaptation to all individual herbicides was associated with pleiotropic fitness costs in stress-free environments, we observed that accumulation of resistance mechanisms was accompanied by a reduction in overall fitness costs. We suggest that antagonistic epistasis may be a driving mechanism that enables populations to more readily adapt in novel environments. These findings highlight the potential for sequences of xenobiotics to facilitate the rapid evolution of multiple-drug and -pesticide resistance, as well as the potential for epistatic interactions between adaptive mutations to facilitate evolutionary rescue in {{rapidly changing}} environments...|$|E
40|$|Grass and {{broad-leaved}} weeds {{can reduce}} both yields and product marketability of desmanthus (Desmanthus virgatus) seed crops, even when cultural control strategies are used. Selective herbicides might economically control these weeds, but, {{prior to this}} study, the few herbicides tolerated by desmanthus did not control key weed contaminants of desmanthus seed crops. In this study, the tolerance of desmanthus cv. Marc to 55 herbicides used for selective weed control in other leguminous crops was assessed in 1 pot trial and 3 Queensland field trials. One field trial assessed the tolerance of desmanthus seedlings to combinations {{of the most promising}} pre-emergent and post emergent herbicides. The pre-emergent herbicides, imazaquin, imazethapyr, pendimethalin, oryzalin and trifluralin, gave useful weed control with very little crop damage. The post-emergent herbicides, haloxyfop, clethodim, propyzamide, <b>carbetamide</b> and dalapon, were safe for controlling grass weeds in desmanthus. Selective post-emergence control of broad-leaved weeds was achieved using bentazone, bromoxynil and imazethapyr. One trial investigated salvaging second-year desmanthus crops from mature perennial weeds, and atrazine, terbacil and hexazinone showed some potential in this role. Overall, our results show that desmanthus tolerates herbicides which collectively control a wide range of weeds encountered in Queensland. These, in combination with cultural weed control strategies, should control most weeds in desmanthus seed crops...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-seven polar pesticides, mainly triazines, phenylurea {{herbicides}} and phenoxy acids, {{were determined}} by LC-atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation MS-MS with methanol and acetonitrile as the organic modifiers. For most pesticides, detection limits were the same irrespective of the modifier. However, for the phenylurea herbicides, propachlor, <b>carbetamide,</b> triadimefon, triadimenol, triethylcitrate, benzothiazole and metazachlor, the results were much poorer {{in the presence of}} acetonitrile; in several cases, no meaningful results were obtained at all. When carrying out trace enrichment of 100 ml water samples on a 10 x 2 mm I. D. solid-phase extraction precolumn containing a polymeric sorbent, rapid desorption with a small volume of pure organic solvent and the introduction of a T-piece in between the solid-phase extraction precolumn and the analytical column was necessary. Aliquots of 300 μl of acetonitrile were optimal for the complete desorption of all analytes from the sorbent. With methanol as the modifier and when using an identification criterion of three ions, the detection limits for most analytes, in the full-scan mode, were 10 - 100 ng/l. The linearity of the procedure, which was tested at the 0. 1 and 1 μg/l levels, was satisfactory in the positive, but not in the negative ionisation mode. The procedures were used to analyse surface water samples. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} stale seedbed {{preparations}} and several weed control methods on {{the emergence of}} weeds in lettuce were studied. The specific goal was {{to evaluate the use}} of a stale seedbed in combination with chemical or mechanical weed control methods in the field. Depending on location and year, stale seedbed preparations followed by weed control prior to planting reduced the amount of weeds during crop growth by 43 ¿ 83 %. Control of the emerged seedlings after a stale seedbed preparation was more effective with glyphosate than with a rotary harrow. Covering the rotary harrow during control to prevent light reaching the soil improved its effect on the weed density during crop growth in two of 3 years. Radiation with far red light (FR) did not reduce the number of emerging weeds in this study. Mechanical control by finger weeder, torsion weeder and hoe was applied without stale seedbed preparations. These measures reduced the weed densities by 88 ¿ 99 %, compared with the untreated control and were more effective than chemical weed control with <b>carbetamide</b> and chlorpropham. The results show that the stale seedbed technique in combination with mechanical control of emerging weeds can reduce the weed population during crop growth as effectively as chemical control. The technique may therefore help reduce the use of herbicides in lettuce crops in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{dissolved}} organic matter (DOM) on desorption behaviour of three herbicides was investigated for a silty clay soil in batch-equilibration experiments. The adsorption of the test compounds increased {{in the range of}} decreasing water-solubilities: <b>carbetamide</b> < atrazine < dimefuron. For desorption with 0. 01 M CaCl_ 2 (reference system) a hysteresis effect could be observed. Also desorption studies revealed that a relationship exists between the slope of the desorption isotherms and the initial adsorbate concentration from which desorption started. Increased desorption could be observed using the DOM-fraction of sewage sludges and liquid manure, while using an extract of straw compost resulted in reduced desorption. Other DOMs used as cosolutes (humic and fulvic acids, soil soluble organic matter, drainage water) die not affect desorption otherwise than the reference system. Except for liquid sewage sludge, adsorption increased after the previous treatment of the soil with DOMs. Desorption isotherms were calculated using a gently modified Freudlich equation and a two compartment model. This assumes that herbicide molecules are partly desorbed according to a linear isotherm, partly correspond to molecules being strongly adsorbed and which desorb according to an exponential equation. The linear compartment is relatively independant of the composition of the desorption solution. By extrapolation it was possible to estimate a quantity of irreversibly adsorbed herbicide. (orig.)
