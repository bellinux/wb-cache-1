25|$|For {{the first}} time in centuries, respectable but daringly fashionable women would leave the house without a hat or bonnet, {{previously}} something often associated with prostitutes. However most women continued to wear something on their head outdoors, though they were beginning to cease to do so indoors during the day (as well as for evening wear). The antique head-dress, or Queen Mary coif, <b>Chinese</b> <b>hat,</b> Oriental inspired turban, and Highland helmet were popular. As for bonnets, their crowns and brims were adorned with increasingly elaborate ornamentations, such as feathers and ribbons. In fact, ladies of the day embellished their hats frequently, replacing old decorations with new trims or feathers.|$|E
6000|$|Is {{it not a}} {{shame that}} we, who prate so much about civilization and humanity, are content to degrade a fellow-being to such an office as this? Is it not time for {{reflection}} when we find ourselves willing to see in such a being matter for frivolous curiosity instead of regret and grave reflection? Here was a poor creature whom hard fortune had exiled from his natural home beyond the seas, and whose troubles ought to have touched these idle strangers that thronged about him; but did it? Apparently not. Men calling themselves the superior race, the race of culture and of gentle blood, scanned his quaint <b>Chinese</b> <b>hat,</b> with peaked roof and ball on top, and his long queue dangling down his back; his short silken blouse, curiously frogged and figured (and, {{like the rest of}} his raiment, rusty, dilapidated, and awkwardly put on); his blue cotton, tight-legged pants, tied close around the ankles; and his clumsy blunt-toed shoes with thick cork soles; and having so scanned him from head to foot, cracked some unseemly joke about his outlandish attire or his melancholy face, and passed on. In my heart I pitied the friendless Mongol. I wondered what was passing behind his sad face, and what distant scene his vacant eye was dreaming of. Were his thoughts with his heart, ten thousand miles away, beyond the billowy wastes of the Pacific? among the ricefields and the plumy palms of China? under the shadows of remembered mountain peaks, or in groves of bloomy shrubs and strange forest trees unknown to climes like ours? And now and then, rippling among his visions and his dreams, did he hear familiar laughter and half-forgotten voices, and did he catch fitful glimpses of the friendly faces of a bygone time? A cruel fate it is, I said, that is befallen this bronzed wanderer. In order that the group of idlers might be touched at least by the words of the poor fellow, since the appeal of his pauper dress and his dreary exile was lost upon them, I touched him on the shoulder and said: ...|$|E

60|$|The {{colors were}} varied and startling, the {{architecture}} amazing.

At all levels were the myriad poles surmounted by grinning skulls; but the two most prominent features of the city were the round tower of human skulls that Bradley had noted earlier in the day and another and much larger edifice {{near the center of the}} city. As they approached it, Bradley saw that it was a huge building rising a hundred feet in height from the ground and that it stood alone in the center of what might have been called a plaza in some other part of the world.

5000|$|Although {{they were}} backups, the Chinese Bandits became beloved and {{respected}} among the team {{due to their}} toughness and relentless style of play. Dietzel himself proclaimed, [...] "One of the greatest thrills I had in the coaching business was the Chinese Bandits." [...] Players considered it a privilege {{to play in the}} unit. One player even refused his promotion to the starting unit so he could remain a Bandit. Another player, Merle Schexnaildre, happily accepted a move from fullback to linebacker as a junior. Said defensive coach Charles McClendon of the unit: [...] "They didn't know they weren't a good football team - nobody ever told them. They were 100-percent go-getters."The Bandits were hugely popular among fans. In 1958, a local restaurant gave away free <b>Chinese</b> coolie <b>hats</b> with meals and sold over 1,400 of them in a single day. A disk jockey wrote a song about the unit, which the LSU band played whenever the unit took the field. Members of the Bandits appeared in the October 12, 1959 issue of Life magazine, dressed in their football uniforms and wearing masks that resembled aged Chinese men.

60|$|When {{she came}} back, Ramona in a {{pleasant}} lather, Saxon rode {{to the rear}} of the house, past the chicken houses and the flourishing berry-rows, to join Billy on the rim of the bench, where he sat on his horse in the shade, smoking a cigarette. Together they looked down through an opening among the trees to the meadow which was a meadow no longer. With mathematical accuracy it was divided into squares, oblongs, and narrow strips, which displayed sharply the thousand hues of green of a truck garden. Gow Yum and Chan Chi, under enormous <b>Chinese</b> grass <b>hats,</b> were planting green onions. Old Hughie, hoe in hand, plodded along the main artery of running water, opening certain laterals, closing others. From the work-shed beyond the barn the strokes of a hammer told Saxon that Carlsen was wire-binding vegetable boxes. Mrs. Paul's cheery soprano, lifted in a hymn, doated through the trees, accompanied by the whirr of an egg-beater. A sharp barking told where Possum still waged hysterical and baffled war on the Douglass squirrels. Billy took a long draw from his cigarette, exhaled the smoke, and continued to look down at the meadow. Saxon divined trouble in his manner. His rein-hand was on the pommel, and her free hand went out and softly rested on his. Billy turned his slow gaze upon her mare's lather, seeming not to note it, and continued on to Saxon's face.|$|R

II. Characteristics of Chinese Embroidery (Folk Art) for Children’s Ware 1. Folk Art and Chinese Culture • The core of Chinese folk art is its symbolism and cultural connections. • Folk art {{is a reflection of the}} larger culture characteristics (i. e., the symbolic nature of Chinese writings and its ideology) • In China, many of the symbols used in folk art are derived from traditional moral teachings and legend stories that have been passed on from generation to generation. • Four basic symbols for a happy life are luck (fu), wealth or officialdom (lu) longevity (shou), and happiness (xi). • People always believed that the death of children was due to the effect of evil. Therefore, children ware is always decorated with auspicious designs (symbols) to portray the presence of supernatural power to ward off the evils and the attainment for the four elements for a happy life. • Five cardinal virtues for the Chinese are good morals, propriety (good behavior), justice, benevolence (humanity) and trust. • Types of <b>Chinese</b> children’s <b>hats</b> include rice bowl hat, wind hat, animal hat, open crown hat, scholar cap, and crown hat...|$|R

40|$|Under microgravity, {{the usual}} methods of placing {{granular}} solids into, or extracting them from, containers or storage vessels will not function. Alternative methods {{are required to}} provide a motive force to move the material. New configurations for microgravity regolith storage vessels that do not resemble terrestrial silos, hoppers, or tanks are proposed. The microgravity-compatible bulk-material storage vessels and exit feed configurations are designed to reliably empty and feed cohesive material to transfer vessels or conveying ducts or lines without gravity. A controllable motive force drives the cohesive material to the exit opening(s), and provides a reliable means to empty storage vessels and/or to feed microgravity conveying lines. The proposed designs will function equally well in vacuum, or inside of pressurized enclosures. Typical terrestrial granular solids handling and storage equipment will not function under microgravity, since almost all such equipment relies on gravity to at least move material to an exit location or to place it {{in the bottom of}} a container. Under microgravity, there effectively are no directions of up or down, and in order to effect movement of material, some other motive force must be applied to the material. The proposed storage vessels utilize dynamic centrifugal force to effect movement of regolith whenever material needs to be removed from the storage vessel. During simple storage, no dynamic motion or forces are required. The rotation rate during emptying can be controlled to ensure that material will move to the desired exit opening, even if the material is highly cohesive, or has acquired an electrostatic charge. The general concept of this Swirl Action Utilized for Centrifugal Ejection of Regolith (SAUCER) microgravity storage unit/dynamic feeder is to have an effective slot-hopper (based on the converging angles of the top and bottom conical section of the vessel) with an exit slot around the entire periphery of the SAUCER. The basic shape of such a unit is like two <b>Chinese</b> straw <b>hats</b> (douli) - one upside down, on the bottom, and another on top; or two wokpans, one upright on the bottom and another inverted on top, with a small gap between the upright and inverted pans or hats (around the periphery). A stationary outer ring, much like an unmounted bicycle tire, surrounds the gap between the two coaxial, nearly conical pieces, forming the top and bottom of the unit...|$|R
60|$|Men of {{substance}} sported superfine Saxony with the broadest of silk-velvet collars; but the fit suggested second-hand finery. Other elongated cocoa-nuts bore jauntily a black felt of 'pork-pie' order, leek-green billycocks, and anything gaudy, but not neat, in the 'tile'-line. Their bright azure ribbons and rainbow neckties and scarves vied in splendour with the loudest of thunder-and-lightning waistcoats {{from the land}} of Moses and Sons. Pants were worn tight, to show the grand thickness of knee, the delicate leanness of calf, the manly purchase of heel, and the waving line of beauty which here distinguishes shin-bones. There were monstrous studs upon a glorious expanse of 'biled' shirt; a small investment of cheap, tawdry rings set off the chimpanzee-like fingers; and, often enough, gloves invested the hands, whose horny, reticulated skin reminded me of the black fowl, or the scaly feet of African cranes pacing at ease over the burning sands. Each dandy had his badine upon whose nice conduct he prided himself; the toothpick was as omnipresent as the crutch, nor was the 'quizzing-glass' quite absent. Lower extremities, of the same category as the hands, but slightly superior in point of proportional size, were crammed into patent-leather boots, the latter looking {{as if they had been}} stuffed with some inanimate substance--say the halves of a calf's head. Why cannot these men adopt some modification of the <b>Chinese</b> costume, felt <b>hat</b> and white shoes, drawers, and upper raiment half-shirt, half-doublet?

5000|$|Soon after Martini's arrival to China, the Ming capital Beijing fell to Li Zicheng's rebels (April, 1644) {{and then}} to the Manchus, and the last {{legitimate}} Ming emperor, the Chongzhen Emperor, hanged himself. Down in Zhenjiang, Martini continued working with the short-lived regime of Zhu Yujian, Prince of Tang, who set himself up as the (Southern) Ming Longwu Emperor. Soon enough, the Manchu troops reached Zhejiang. According to Martini's own report (which appeared in some editions of his De bello tartarico), the Jesuit was able to switch his allegiance to China's new masters in an easy enough, but bold, way. When Wenzhou, in southern Zhejiang, where Martini happened to be on a mission for Zhu Yujian, was besieged by the Manchus and was about to fall, the Jesuit decorated the house where he was staying with a large red poster with seven characters saying, [...] "Here lives a doctor of the divine Law who has come from the Great West". Under the poster he set up tables with European books, astronomical instruments, etc., surrounding an altar with an image of Jesus. When the Manchu troops arrived, their commander was sufficiently impressed with the display to approach Martini politely and ask if he wished to switch his loyalty to the new Qing Dynasty. Martini agreed, and had his head shaved in the Manchu way, and his <b>Chinese</b> dress and <b>hat</b> replaced with Manchu-style ones. The Manchus then allowed him to return to his Hangzhou church, and provided him and the Hangzhou Christian community with necessary protection.|$|R
