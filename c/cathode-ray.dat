5|$|The Nimrod {{was created}} {{only four years}} after the 1947 {{invention}} of the <b>cathode-ray</b> tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, and one year after a similar purpose built game-playing machine, Bertie the Brain, the first computer-based game to feature a visual display of any sort. The Nimrod is considered under some definitions one of the first video games, possibly the second. While definitions vary, the prior <b>cathode-ray</b> tube amusement device was a purely analog electrical game, and while the Nimrod and Bertie did not feature an electronic screen they both had a game running on a computer. The software-based tic-tac-toe game OXO and a draughts program by Christopher Strachey were programmed a year later in 1952 and were the first computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen rather than through light bulbs.|$|E
5|$|Tennis for Two is {{considered}} under some definitions {{to be the}} first video game. Other candidates with stronger candidacies from a technological standpoint include the 1947 <b>cathode-ray</b> tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, though it did not run on a computing device; the 1950 Bertie the Brain, the earliest known game to run on a computer, though it used light bulbs for a display; and OXO and a draughts game by Christopher Strachey in 1952, the earliest digital computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen. Tennis for Two, though it contained no technological developments to separate it from earlier games, has the distinction of being the earliest known computer game with visuals created purely for entertainment purposes. Prior games were created primarily for academic research purposes or to demonstrate the computing power of the underlying machine, {{with the exception of the}} non-computer based <b>cathode-ray</b> tube amusement device. This, therefore, makes Tennis for Two the first video game under some definitions from a philosophical viewpoint rather than a technical one and a distinctive moment in the early history of video games.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{was allowed}} back onto operations. He was given command of No. 85 Squadron RAF, {{equipped}} with the de Havilland Mosquito NF.II based at Hunsdon. He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The radar set displayed the entire picture. A small <b>cathode-ray</b> tube set {{on the left side}} of the instrument panel gave Cunningham a composite image. The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception in the initial stages until they reached a point where the enemy could take evasive action. Then Cunningham would take over while Rawnsley would call out the ranges and free the pilot from looking at his ray-tube.|$|E
5|$|Kates {{built the}} game to {{showcase}} his additron tube, a miniature version of the vacuum tube, though the transistor overtook it in computer development shortly thereafter. Patent issues prevented the additron tube from being used in computers besides Bertie before {{it was no longer}} useful. Bertie the Brain is a candidate for the first video game, as it was potentially the first computer game to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only three years after the 1947 invention of the <b>cathode-ray</b> tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display. Berties use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.|$|E
5|$|The game of Nim {{running on}} the Nimrod is a {{candidate}} for one of the first video games, as {{it was one of the}} first computer games to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only four years after the 1947 invention of the <b>cathode-ray</b> tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game to use an electronic display, and one year after Bertie the Brain, a computer similar to the Nimrod which played tic-tac-toe at the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. The Nimrod's use of light bulbs rather than a screen with real-time visual graphics, however, much less moving graphics, does not meet some definitions of a video game.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{game that}} used a {{graphical}} display, the <b>cathode-ray</b> tube amusement device is generally not considered under most definitions to {{be a candidate for}} the first video game, as it used purely analog hardware and did not run on a computing device; some loose definitions may still consider it a video game, but it is still usually disqualified as the device was never manufactured. Nevertheless, it is the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to incorporate an electronic display, thus making it a forerunner to other games in the early history of video games. As the device was never manufactured or widely shown, however, it did not directly inspire any other games and had no impact on the future video game industry.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1947 {{invention}} of the <b>cathode-ray</b> tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game {{as well as the}} first to use an electronic display, the first true video games were created in the early 1950s. Initially created as technology demonstrations, such as the Bertie the Brain and Nimrod computers in 1950 and 1951, video games also became the purview of academic research. A series of games, generally simulating real-world board games, were created at various research institutions to explore programming, human–computer interaction, and computer algorithms. These include OXO and Christopher Strachey's draughts program in 1952, the first software-based games to incorporate a CRT display, and several chess and checkers programs. Possibly the first video game created simply for entertainment was 1958's Tennis for Two, featuring moving graphics on an oscilloscope. As computing technology improved over time, computers became smaller and faster, and the ability to work on them was opened up to university employees and undergraduate students {{by the end of the}} 1950s. These new programmers began to create games for non-academic purposes, leading up to the 1962 release of Spacewar! as one of the earliest known digital computer games to be available outside a single research institute.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} {{to these}} games include the <b>cathode-ray</b> tube amusement device, {{the earliest known}} interactive electronic game {{as well as the}} first to incorporate a cathode ray tube screen. The player simulates an artillery shell trajectory on a CRT screen connected to an oscilloscope, with a set of knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program. It was patented by Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann in 1947. While the idea behind the game was potentially to use a television set as the display and thus sell the invention to consumers, as Goldsmith and Mann worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories, the patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used and the device never manufactured beyond the original handmade prototypes. This, along with the lack of electronic logic circuits, keeps the device from being considered the first video game. Around {{the same time as the}} device was invented, the earliest known written computer game was developed by Alan Turing and David Champernowne in 1948, a chess simulation called Turochamp, though it was never actually implemented on a computer as the code was too complicated to run on the machines of the time. Turing tested the code in a game in 1952 where he mimicked the operation of the code in a real chess game against an opponent, but was never able to run the program on a computer.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cathode-ray</b> tube {{amusement}} device {{was invented by}} physicists Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann. The pair worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories specializing {{in the development of}} cathode ray tubes that used electronic signal outputs to project a signal onto television screens. Goldsmith, who had received a Ph.D. in physics from Cornell University in 1936 with a focus on oscilloscope design, was {{at the time of the}} device's invention the director of research for DuMont Laboratories in New Jersey. The two inventors were inspired by the radar displays used in World War II, which Goldsmith had worked on during the war. The patent for the device was filed on January 25, 1947 and issued on December 14, 1948. The patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used by either the inventors or DuMont Laboratories, and the device was never manufactured beyond original handmade prototype. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers historian Alex Magoun has speculated that Goldsmith did not make the prototype with the intent for it to be the basis of any future production, but only designed the device as a demonstration of the kind of commercial opportunities DuMont could pursue. Goldsmith did not work on games after the invention of the device; he was promoted to vice president in 1953 and left DuMont—by then split up and sold to other firms—to become a professor of physics at Furman University in 1966. Goldsmith kept the device and brought it with him to Furman; in a 2016 interview fellow physics professor Bill Brantley recalled Goldsmith demonstrating the game to him.|$|E
25|$|Hence, {{from the}} mid-1950s {{solid-state}} {{devices such as}} transistors gradually replaced tubes. The <b>cathode-ray</b> tube (CRT) remained the basis for televisions and video monitors until superseded in the 21st century. However, {{there are still a}} few applications for which tubes are preferred to semiconductors; for example, the magnetron used in microwave ovens, and certain high-frequency amplifiers.|$|E
25|$|Stereoscopic 3D {{television}} was demonstrated {{for the first}} time on August 10, 1928, by John Logie Baird in his company's premises at 133 Long Acre, London. Baird pioneered a variety of 3D television systems using electro-mechanical and <b>cathode-ray</b> tube techniques. The first 3D TV was produced in 1935. The advent of digital television in the 2000s greatly improved 3D TVs.|$|E
25|$|An oscilloscope, {{previously}} {{called an}} oscillograph, and informally {{known as a}} scope or o-scope, CRO (for <b>cathode-ray</b> oscilloscope), or DSO (for the more modern digital storage oscilloscope), {{is a type of}} electronic test instrument that allows observation of constantly varying signal voltages, usually as a two-dimensional plot of one or more signals as a function of time. Other signals (such as sound or vibration) can be converted to voltages and displayed.|$|E
25|$|On 5 December 2012 the {{antitrust}} regulators of Barroso Commission fined Philips, LG Electronics, Samsung SDI, Panasonic, Toshiba and Technicolor for price fixing of TV <b>cathode-ray</b> tubes in two cartels lasting nearly a decade. The biggest fine, of 313.4 million euros, was imposed on Philips, followed by LG Electronics with 295.6 million euros. Panasonic was fined 157.5 million euros, Samsung SDI 150.8 million euros, Technicolor 38.6 million euros and Toshiba 28 million euros.|$|E
25|$|Cathode {{depletion}} is {{the loss}} of emission after thousands of hours of normal use. Sometimes emission can be restored for a time by raising heater voltage, either for a short time or a permanent increase of a few percent. Cathode depletion was uncommon in signal tubes but was a frequent cause of failure of monochrome television <b>cathode-ray</b> tubes. Usable life of this expensive component was sometimes extended by fitting a boost transformer to increase heater voltage.|$|E
25|$|Seven early customers, namely British Airways, Cathay Pacific, KLM, Lufthansa, Northwest, Qantas, and Singapore Airlines, {{formed a}} consultative group to advise Boeing on the 747-400's design process. While the {{aircraft}} was planned as a new-technology upgrade, Boeing originally proposed minimal design changes {{in order to}} reduce development cost and retain commonality with existing models. The airline consultative group sought more advanced changes, including a two-crew glass cockpit. As a result of airline input, the 747-400's new digital cockpit design featured a hybrid of the <b>cathode-ray</b> tube (CRT) display technologies first employed on the 757 and 767, along with carry-over 747 systems such as its autopilot.|$|E
25|$|One {{graduate}} student with whom Boring developed a student-professor relationship {{similar to the}} one Boring had had with Titchener was Stanley Smith Stevens. In 1936 the two published their research on tonal brightness. At the time it was known that tonal brightness varied with pitch; and, based on previous research, it was believed that high tones are bright and low tones are dull. The question that Stevens and Boring researched was concerning the bright and dull tones that could be produced with a siren when the holes were appropriately spaced, hypothesizing that brightness varies with both the intensity and the frequency of the pitch. Boring suggested that they embrace the new technology and conduct the experiment with a <b>cathode-ray</b> oscilloscope and a wave-analyzer. They concluded through this study that tonal brightness is essentially the same as tonal density.|$|E
25|$|Overheating of {{internal}} parts, such as control grids or mica spacer insulators, {{can result in}} trapped gas escaping into the tube; this can reduce performance. A getter is used to absorb gases evolved during tube operation, but has only a limited ability to combine with gas. Control of the envelope temperature prevents some types of gassing. A tube with an unusually high level {{of internal}} gas may exhibit a visible blue glow when plate voltage is applied. The getter (being a highly reactive metal) is effective against many atmospheric gases, but has no (or very limited) chemical reactivity to inert gases such as helium. One progressive type of failure, especially with physically large envelopes such as those used by camera tubes and <b>cathode-ray</b> tubes, comes from helium infiltration. The exact mechanism is not clear: the metal-to-glass lead-in seals are one possible infiltration site.|$|E
500|$|Bertie {{was created}} {{only three years}} after the 1947 {{invention}} of the <b>cathode-ray</b> tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, and while non-visual games had been developed for research computers such as Alan Turing and Dietrich Prinz's chess program for the Ferranti Mark 1 at the University of Manchester, Bertie was the first computer-based game to feature a visual display of any sort. Bertie is considered under some definitions in contention for the title of the first video game. [...] While definitions vary, the prior <b>cathode-ray</b> tube amusement device was a purely analog electrical game, and while Bertie did not feature an electronic screen it did run on a computer. Another special-purpose computer-based game, Nimrod, was built in 1951, while the software-based tic-tac-toe game OXO and a draughts program by Christopher Strachey were in 1952 the first computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen rather than light bulbs.|$|E
500|$|As {{development}} progressed, the 757 increasingly {{departed from}} its 727 origins and adopted elements from the 767, which was several months ahead in development. To reduce risk and cost, Boeing combined design work on both twinjets, resulting in shared {{features such as}} interior fittings and handling characteristics. Computer-aided design, first applied on the 767, was used for over one-third of the 757's design drawings. In early 1979, a common two-crew member glass cockpit was adopted for the two aircraft, including shared instrumentation, avionics, and flight management systems. [...] <b>Cathode-ray</b> tube (CRT) color displays replaced conventional electromechanical instruments, with increased automation eliminating the flight engineer position common to three-person cockpits. After completing a short conversion course, pilots rated on the 757 could be qualified to fly the 767 and vice versa, owing to their design similarities.|$|E
500|$|The {{technological}} advances {{incorporated into the}} Harrier II, compared with the original Harrier, significantly reduce the workload on the pilot. The supercritical wing, hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) control principle, and increased engineered [...] stability make the aircraft fundamentally easier to fly. Ed Harper, general manager for the McDonnell Douglas Harrier II development program, summarized: [...] "The AV-8B {{looks a lot like}} the original Harrier and it uses the same operating fundamentals. It just uses them a lot better". A large <b>cathode-ray</b> tube multi-purpose display, taken from the F/A-18, makes up much of the instrument panel in the cockpit. It has a wide range of functions, including radar warning information and weapon delivery checklist. The pilots sit on UPC/Stencel 10B zero-zero ejection seats, meaning that they are able to eject from a stationary aircraft at zero altitude.|$|E
500|$|The <b>cathode-ray</b> tube {{amusement}} device is {{the earliest known}} interactive electronic game. The device simulates an artillery shell arcing towards targets on a cathode ray tube (CRT) screen, which {{is controlled by the}} player by adjusting knobs to change the trajectory of a CRT beam spot on the display in order to reach plastic targets overlaid on the screen. Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann constructed the game from analog electronics and filed for a patent in 1947, which was issued the following year. The gaming device was never manufactured or marketed to the public, so it had no effect on the future video game industry. Under most definitions, the device is not considered a video game, as while it had an electronic display it did not run on a computing device. [...] Therefore, despite its relevance to the early history of video games, it is not generally considered a candidate for the title of the first video game.|$|E
500|$|While the Su-27M design had the {{avionics}} to {{give the}} aircraft the nominal designation as a multi-role fighter, flight tests with the Russian Air Force revealed difficulties in efficiently deploying the aircraft's armament. According to Aviation Week & Space Technology, air force pilots described weapons trials with the aircraft in Akhtubinsk and Lipetsk as a [...] "negative experience", with a particular emphasis on {{the layout of the}} cockpit and its adverse impact on the workload of the single pilot. Designers, test pilots and avionics software specialists therefore worked together to redesign the cockpit and its attendant systems and improve the human-machine interface. The information management system of aircraft's avionics suite had been changed so that it now has two digital computers which process information from the flight- and weapons-control systems. The information is then displayed on two [...] multi-function liquid crystal displays, which replaced the smaller multi-function <b>cathode-ray</b> tube displays found on the Su-27M. The pilot can also view critical flight information on the head-up display, and is [...] equipped with Hands On Throttle-And-Stick (HOTAS) controls.|$|E
500|$|The <b>cathode-ray</b> tube {{amusement}} device {{consists of a}} cathode ray tube connected to an oscilloscope {{with a set of}} knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program. The CRT projects a spot on the oscilloscope display screen, which traces a parabolic arc across the screen when a switch is activated by the player. This beam spot represents the trajectory of an artillery shell. Overlaid on the screen are transparent plastic targets representing objects such as airplanes. At the end of the spot's trajectory, the beam defocuses, resulting in the spot expanding and blurring. This represents the shell exploding as if detonated by a time fuze. The goal of the game is to have the beam defocus when it is within the bounds of a target. Prior to the beam spot beginning its arc, the player can turn the control knobs to direct the beam spot's trajectory and adjust the delay of the shell burst. The machine can be set to fire a [...] "shell" [...] either once or at a regular interval, which is adjustable by the player. This gives the player the goal of hitting one of the overlay targets with the shell burst within a time limit. The player was recommended to make the trajectory far removed from a straight line [...] "so as to require an increased amount of skill and care".|$|E
2500|$|The Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) {{began an}} {{experimental}} RGB field-sequential color system in 1940. Images were scanned electrically, {{but the system}} still used a moving part: the transparent RGB color wheel rotating at above 1,200 rpm in synchronism with the vertical scan. [...] The camera and the <b>cathode-ray</b> tube (CRT) were both monochromatic. Color was provided by color wheels in the camera and the receiver.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the decades}} around 1910, radio {{was a new}} technology, fertile for innovation. In 1912, while working at Princeton University, Goddard {{investigated}} the effects of radio waves on insulators. In order to generate radio-frequency power, he invented a vacuum tube that operated like a <b>cathode-ray</b> oscillator tube. [...] was issued on November 2, 1915. This was the first use of a vacuum tube to amplify a signal, preceding even Lee de Forest's claim.|$|E
2500|$|Samsung SDI {{is listed}} on the Korea Exchange stock-exchange (number 006400). On 5 December 2012, the European Union's {{antitrust}} regulator fined Samsung SDI and several other major companies for fixing prices of TV <b>cathode-ray</b> tubes in two cartels lasting nearly a decade. SSDI also builds lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles such as the BMW i3, and acquired Magna Steyr's battery plant in 2015. SSDI began using the [...] "21700" [...] cell format in August 2015. Samsung {{plans to build a}} factory in Hungary to supply 50,000 cars per year.|$|E
2500|$|The {{move to the}} {{laboratories}} occurred {{in the spring of}} 1930, and the difficult task of developing a transmitter could begin. There was an in-house evaluation in mid-1930, where the kinescope performed well (but with only 60 lines definition), and the transmitter was still of a mechanical type. A [...] "breakthrough" [...] would come when the Zworykin team decided to develop a new type of cathode ray transmitter, one described in the French and British patents of 1928 priority by the Hungarian inventor Kalman Tihanyi whom the company had approached in July 1930, after the publication of his patents in England and France. This was a curious design, one where the scanning electron beam would strike the photoelectric cell from the same side where the optical image was cast. Even more importantly, it was a system characterized by an operation based on an entirely new principle, the principle of the accumulation and storage of charges during the entire time between two scansions by the <b>cathode-ray</b> beam.|$|E
2500|$|Minor uses of {{ethylene}} glycol include {{the manufacture of}} capacitors, as a chemical intermediate {{in the manufacture of}} 1,4-dioxane, as an additive to prevent corrosion in liquid cooling systems for personal computers, and inside the lens devices of <b>cathode-ray</b> tube type of rear projection televisions. Ethylene glycol is also used in the manufacture of some vaccines, but it is not itself present in these injections. [...] It is used as a minor (1–2%) ingredient in shoe polish and also in some inks and dyes. Ethylene glycol has seen some use as a rot and fungal treatment for wood, both as a preventative and a treatment after the fact. It has been used in a few cases to treat partially rotted wooden objects to be displayed in museums. It is one of only a few treatments that are successful in dealing with rot in wooden boats, and is relatively cheap. Ethylene glycol may also be one of the minor ingredients in screen cleaning solutions, along with the main ingredient isopropyl alcohol. Ethylene glycol is commonly used as a preservative for biological specimens, especially in secondary schools during dissection as a safer alternative to formaldehyde. It can also be used in killing jars. It is also used as part of the water-based hydraulic fluid used to control subsea oil and gas production equipment.|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, Vladimir Zworykin, who {{had been}} {{developing}} his own all-electronic television system at Westinghouse in Pittsburgh since 1923, but which {{he had never been}} able to make work or satisfactorily demonstrate to his superiors, was recruited by RCA to lead its television development department. Before leaving his old employer, Zworykin visited Farnsworth's laboratory and was sufficiently impressed with the performance of the Image Dissector that he reportedly had his team at Westinghouse make several copies of the device for experimentation. But Zworykin later abandoned research on the Image Dissector, which at the time required extremely bright illumination of its subjects to be effective, and turned his attention to what would become the Iconoscope. In a 1970s series of videotaped interviews, Zworykin recalled that, [...] "Farnsworth was closer to this thing you're using now [...] than anybody, because he used the <b>cathode-ray</b> tube for transmission. But, Farnsworth didn't have the mosaic , he didn't have storage. Therefore, [...] definition was very low.... But he was very proud, and he stuck to his method." [...] Contrary to Zworykin's statement, Farnsworth's patent #2,087,683 for the Image Dissector (filed April 26, 1933) features the [...] "charge storage plate" [...] invented by Tihanyi in 1928 and a [...] "low velocity" [...] method of electron scanning, also describes [...] "discrete particles" [...] whose [...] "potential" [...] is manipulated and [...] "saturated" [...] to varying degrees depending on their velocity. Farnsworth's patent numbers 2,140,695 and 2,233,888 are for a [...] "charge storage dissector" [...] and [...] "charge storage amplifier," [...] respectively.|$|E
