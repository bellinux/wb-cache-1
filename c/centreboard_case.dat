50|$|A steel {{centreboard}} is in a <b>centreboard</b> <b>case</b> with {{a purchase}} to lift it.|$|E
50|$|The Colleen is a half decked gaff rigged {{centreboard}} day {{boat with}} the <b>centreboard</b> <b>case</b> fixed externally under the boat.|$|E
50|$|The {{spine of}} the boat is an {{extended}} <b>centreboard</b> <b>case</b> running from stem to stern, which gives enormous strength to the hull structure. The gunter rig design allows the spars to be easily stored inside the boat and kept under a flat cover when not in use.|$|E
5000|$|Other modern {{features}} are carbon fibre prods (bowsprits) supported by bob stays, dolphin strikers and bow struts. This enabled quicker setting and dropping {{of the large}} downwind sails. Huge spinnakers could be set quickly by having halyards geared by mini blocks running internally in the mast. Dacron sails were replaced by much lighter stiffer less porous material such as mylar plastic. Weights of the bare hulls dropped quickly when New Zealand designer Bruce Farr, using his experience in Moth and Cherub designs used thin 3mm ply supported by multiple lightweight stringers and stiffened with tissue fibreglass. These were quickly followed by foam and fibreglass hulls first designed by Russell Bowler. Bare hulls weigh 120 lbs but are very strong {{with the use of}} carbon and kevlar to locally reinforce mast steps, <b>centreboard</b> <b>cases,</b> chain plates and wing attachment points. Rudders were placed 500mm aft of the hull to give more control in extreme planing conditions when only the last few feet of the hull was in contact with the water.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 1&2 {{which are}} almost {{identical}} - different builders, lower cabin, semi-enclosed cockpit, twin quarter berths, and a rudder that is located through the cockpit floor. They run their sheets {{back to the}} top of the cabin. With a permanent icebox located beneath the cockpit at the companionway, and a shaped <b>centreboard</b> <b>case</b> on the Mark 1.|$|E
50|$|Both the Mark 1 & 2 and the Elites {{have an open}} <b>centreboard</b> <b>case,</b> {{with the}} keel rising up into the cabin, which {{supports}} a folding table. The head is located ahead of the keel case bulkhead.The 787s have a keel that rakes forward (at approx 75 degrees) into the forward V-Berth. The keel is totally encased, opening through the cabin roof. The head is located beside the keel case.|$|E
50|$|Competition {{for choice}} of which small boat to build became very intense {{during this period}} of dinghy development. Consequently, in order to respond to new public demand and the new {{construction}} techniques, a stitch-and-glue version, very much lighter in weight, with a V-bottom hull, was produced as the DIY Mermaid MK II. Subsequently, a MK III version was also developed which had no rear tank, but with extended side tanks to the transom and a shortened <b>centreboard</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
50|$|Boats take a {{long time}} to build as there are almost no right angles. Amateurs working at night or in {{weekends}} commonly take a year to build a 12-16 ft (3.6 - 5m) craft. Builders with handyman skills will find that over time their skills will increase. For amateurs, starting with a boat built on a jig (temporary wooden frame) is useful as making the jig is all about right angles and basic carpentry skills. Sailboats require about 25% more time than a dinghy type because of the need for built-in buoyancy, <b>centreboard</b> <b>case,</b> centreboard, rudder, mast, boom and a range of special fittings such as chain plates, gudgeons, blocks cleats and tracks.|$|E
