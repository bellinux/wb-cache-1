40|$|Abstract. Research in {{nanoelectronics}} poses {{new challenges}} for metrology, but advances in theory, simulation and computing and networking technology provide new opportunities to couple simulation and metrology. This paper {{begins with a}} brief overview of current work in <b>computational</b> <b>nanoelectronics.</b> Three examples of how computation can assist metrology will then be discussed. The paper concludes with a discussion of how cyberinfrastructure can help connect computing and metrology using the nanoHUB (www. nanoHUB. org) as a specific example...|$|E
40|$|Undesirable short-channel effects {{associated}} with the relentless downscaling of conventional CMOS devices {{have led to the}} emergence of new classes of MOSFETs. This has led to new and unprecedented challenges in <b>computational</b> <b>nanoelectronics.</b> The device sizes have already reached the level of tens of nanometers where quantum nature of charge-carriers dominates the device operation and performance. The goal {{of this paper is to}} describe an on-going initiative on nanoHUB. org to provide new models, algorithms, approaches, and a comprehensive suite of freelyavailable web-based simulation tools for nanoscale devices with capabilities not yet available commercially. Three software packages nanoFET, nanoMOS and QuaMC are benchmarked in the simulation of a widely-studied high-performance novel MOSFET device. The impact of quantum mechanical effects on the device properties is elucidated and key design issues are suggested. Keywords: NanoHUB; MOSFETs; Quantum effects; Online simulation; NEGF. 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractModelling of multi-million atomic {{semiconductor}} structures {{is important}} as {{it not only}} predicts properties of physically realizable novel materials, but can accelerate advanced device designs. This work elaborates a new Technology-Computer-Aided-Design (TCAD) tool for nanoelectronics modelling, which uses a sp 3 d 5 s∗ tight-binding approach to describe multi-million atomic structures, and simulate electronic structures with high performance computing (HPC), including atomic effects such as alloy and dopant disorders. Being named as Quantum simulation tool for Advanced Nanoscale Devices (Q-AND), the tool shows nice scalability on traditional multi-core HPC clusters implying the strong capability of large-scale electronic structure simulations, particularly with remarkable performance enhancement on latest clusters of Intel Xeon PhiTM coprocessors. A review of the recent modelling study conducted to understand an experimental work of highly phosphorus-doped silicon nanowires, is presented {{to demonstrate the utility}} of Q-AND. Having been developed via Intel Parallel Computing Center project, Q-AND will be open to public to establish a sound framework of nanoelectronics modelling with advanced HPC clusters of a many-core base. With details of the development methodology and exemplary study of dopant electronics, this work will present a practical guideline for TCAD development to researchers in the field of <b>computational</b> <b>nanoelectronics...</b>|$|E
