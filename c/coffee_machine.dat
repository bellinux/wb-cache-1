5|$|Babe starts serving breakfasts in the pub, {{putting her}} in direct {{competition}} with the local café, which starts a feud with its owner, Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth). Babe tries to sabotage Kathy's business by poisoning her <b>coffee</b> <b>machine,</b> disgusting the Carter family. Babe creates a scheme to illegally serve alcohol with breakfast and unwittingly serves beer to a police detective who is working undercover. Days later, Babe, Mick and Shirley are arrested for breaching the licence laws, but Babe lies to the police that it was Mick's plan that she was following. Mick, Shirley and Babe are ordered to pay a fine. When Sylvie belittles Babe, she leaves Sylvie by the canal in the rain, although Sylvie is found and Shirley realises that Babe left Sylvie to die and disowns her. When Shirley finds Babe stealing from the Vic, she physically throws her out and explains to Mick. Babe pleads with him to let her stay, but Mick rejects her so she insults Linda. Mick ejects Babe from the Vic and she curses the family, hoping they lose everything.|$|E

25|$|Coffee may be brewed by {{steeping}} in {{a device}} {{such as a}} French press (also known as a cafetière, coffee press or coffee plunger). Ground coffee and hot water are combined in a cylindrical vessel and left to brew for a few minutes. A circular filter which fits tightly in the cylinder fixed to a plunger is then pushed {{down from the top}} to force the grounds to the bottom. The filter retains the grounds at the bottom as the coffee is poured from the container. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the water, all the coffee oils remain in the liquid, making it a stronger beverage. This method of brewing leaves more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic <b>coffee</b> <b>machine.</b> Supporters of the French press method point out that the sediment issue can be minimized by using the right type of grinder: they claim that a rotary blade grinder cuts the coffee bean into a wide range of sizes, including a fine coffee dust that remains as sludge {{at the bottom of the}} cup, while a burr grinder uniformly grinds the beans into consistently-sized grinds, allowing the coffee to settle uniformly and be trapped by the press. Within the first minute of brewing 95% of the caffeine is released from the coffee bean.|$|E

Comparing New York to Sodom, Kenneth claims that he has been [...] "sodomized," [...] and feels guilty that he has let New York change him, contrary to a promise he made to his mother.

500|$|... "She Wolf" [...] {{was written}} by Shakira, John Hill, and Sam Endicott. Shakira and Hill also served as the {{producers}} of the song. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shakira said that the idea for [...] "She Wolf" [...] came to her [...] "very mysteriously", revealing [...] "I was in the studio {{in a bad mood}} that day, then I got inspired and went to a corner and I wrote the lyrics and the melody in 10 minutes. The image of the she wolf just came to my head, and when I least expected it I was howling and panting". Endicott, musician and lead singer of American post-punk band The Bravery, explained how he and Hill began working with Shakira, saying she [...] "contacted him (Hill), asking if he had any stuff. We never had her in mind. We just made the thing independently of her, and then she liked it a lot, and she sang over it. She used some of the melodies we put in there and then wrote these crazy lyrics about being a werewolf. And that's how it happened". [...] "She Wolf" [...] was described by Slant Magazine as a [...] "sleek, hi-NRG/Italo throwback that's drenched in disco strings". Mikael Wood from Spin identified the song's genre as synthpop. Shakira also howls and pants at various times during the song. It is written in B minor key and is a moderate dance groove with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Shakira's vocal range on the song spans from B3 to D5. One of the lines of the song, in which Shakira sings [...] "I'm starting to feel just a little abused, like a <b>coffee</b> <b>machine</b> in an office", is often cited {{as an example of the}} unusual lyrics present in Shakira's songs.|$|E

2500|$|Kathy accompanies Pam Coker (Lin Blakley) {{when she}} visits Diane Atmore (Hazel Ellerby) {{who is the}} mother of Simon Atmore (Tom Palmer), one of Paul's killers. Kathy and Pam try to persuade Diane to get Simon to plead guilty, which he {{eventually}} does. As a result, Simon {{and the rest of the}} killers are sentenced to thirty years in prison. Kathy is horrified when she hears about Ben wanting to donate some of his liver to Phil. She firmly tells him that she will not allow him to do so but Ben insists. Kathy accompanies Ben to his appointment to discuss the transplant. Kathy tries to support him but ends up embarrassing him when she mentions Paul's death and suggests that it is a reason for Ben wanting to donate. An angry Ben later tells Kathy to stay out of his life as she always has done. Kathy joins the Walford Players and clashes with the Christmas show's director, Geraldine Clough (Gwyneth Strong) over her plans initially to run a talent show, then to have a fairy godmother in her version of A Christmas Carol and finally for casting Kathy as a pantomime horse. Kathy's protests lead to Geraldine's resignation and Kathy becoming the director. Kathy is overjoyed when Ian decides to rename the café back to [...] "Kathy's", which leads her to decide she no longer wants to be Kathy Sullivan, opting to change her name back to Kathy Beale by deed poll. Ben is hurt with Kathy's decision to change her surname to Beale (rather than his surname of Mitchell), feeling pushed out of the family, but she reassures him that it does not make him any less important to her than Ian. Babe Smith (Annette Badland) starts selling breakfasts at The Vic and attempts to steal trade from the café by putting rat droppings in the café's <b>coffee</b> <b>machine,</b> leaving Kathy furious when she finds out. Kathy reports Babe for breaking the Vic's license by selling alcohol outside of their licensed hours. This leads to Babe, Mick and Shirley being arrested and fined, which Kathy feels guilty about. Kathy suffers minor injuries when a car, driven by Michelle (now played by Jenna Russell), crashes a car into the chip shop. After Phil returns from Italy, he tells Kathy about an offer he has received on the car lot land and confides in her about the guilt he still has over the car lot fire. Phil gives Ben the Arches and Kathy lets slip to Ben about the value of the car lot land, which Phil hands over to Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick). Kathy insists to Phil that he justifies his reasons to Ben about the car lot land. Kathy returns from holiday and finds out from Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson) about the gas explosion that left Jane injured and Steven died. Ian rejects Kathy's support. Ben tells Kathy that Ian may still have anger towards her for faking her death, despite accepting her. Kathy confides in Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford) about her relationship with Ian and Carmel advises her to work at it. Kathy tells Ian and Ben that she feels that she has become irrelevant to them, but is determined to be their mum and apologises for not being there and Ian finally shows his emotions.|$|E
