5|$|In autumn, Granpa and Emily went fishing, and {{imagined}} of <b>catching</b> <b>a</b> whale that haled {{them through the}} Thames and through London. At bedtime, Granpa tells Emily the story of The Three Knights, of which was imagined on a bed covers. Though as he reads, he begins to slow up as he begins to drop off. So he end it with his own version, just as Emily was finally going to sleep.|$|E
5|$|On October 9, Georgia Tech {{defeated}} the Davidson Wildcats 66 to 0. Red Barron scored four touchdowns, including an interception return of 76 yards. He also ran in a touchdown from 25 yards out after <b>catching</b> <b>a</b> forward pass from fullback Judy Harlan. Tech attempted six passes the whole game, completing 3 for 114 yards. One of Flowers' punts went 85 yards, the longest in school history.|$|E

5|$|To start with, {{there are}} drills {{to help improve}} the goalkeeper in the water. These range from simple {{exercise}} (such as jumping as high {{out of the water}} as possible with two hands) to drills not specifically used in water polo; rather they are used to improve the goalkeeper's core muscles (such as <b>catching</b> <b>a</b> ball dropped from the side into the water).|$|E
5|$|Banks {{made what}} he {{believed}} to be three of the best saves {{of his career in}} a Stoke shirt. In the first instance he saved and caught a powerful and well-placed header from Manchester City's Wyn Davies from just eight yards out; in the second case he saved a Francis Lee header at Maine Road; and he made his third great save for the club by <b>catching</b> <b>a</b> volley from Tottenham Hotspur's Alan Gilzean that had been hit from just six yards out at White Hart Lane.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{off their}} first {{loss of the}} season, the Triangles played against the Detroit Heralds. Bacon contributed to every point in the first quarter; he first a 3-yard rushing touchdown, and {{followed}} up by a <b>catching</b> <b>a</b> receiving touchdown. Dick Abrell contributed in the second quarter, as he scored a rushing touchdown. Sacksteder caught a receiving touchdown from Roudebush to put the Triangles up 28–0 at halftime. The second half was scoreless, and the Triangles moved on to a 5–1–2 record with one game left in their season.|$|E

50|$|An inside {{straight}} draw, or gutshot draw or belly buster draw, is a {{hand with}} {{four of the}} five cards needed for a straight, but missing one in the middle. For example, 9-x-7-6-5. An inside straight draw has four outs (four cards to fill the missing internal rank). Because straight draws including an ace only have four outs, they are also considered inside straight draws. For example, A-K-Q-J-x or A-2-3-4-x. The probability of <b>catching</b> <b>an</b> out for an inside straight draw is half that of <b>catching</b> <b>an</b> out for an outside straight draw.|$|R

5|$|Following a brief {{interlude}} by Croatian writer Darko Macan, {{the series}} was then taken over by Brian Azzarello, once again hired {{on the strength of}} his own series for Vertigo, 100 Bullets. Azzarello's run is one large meta-story, that follows John Constantine on a trip across America, starting with his incarceration in prison, then variously uncovering a pornography ring, <b>catching</b> <b>a</b> serial killer, taking on a Neo Nazi group before finally dealing with the architect of his incarceration, Stanley W. Manor, a thinly-veiled pastiche of Batman. Brian Azzarello did return for one of the five stories in issue #250.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Sasha {{leaves a}} pigeon at the ShadowClan border {{to prove to}} Tigerstar that kittypets can hunt. After <b>catching</b> <b>a</b> rabbit, Sasha is {{attacked}} by two foxes. Before she can escape, though, Tigerstar comes and attacks the duo of animals, telling her to run. Scrambling up a tree, Sasha sees that the foxes have an advantage over him, and she jumps down to assist him. After defeating both foxes, Tigerstar stays in her den for the night and lets his wounds heal, and tells Sasha that he came to thank her for the pigeon, and that she is unlike any housecat he has ever known.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{gameplay}} issues when the player takes {{their turn to}} bat. The AI is not developed and, when the player hits a pitch, it nearly always takes the longest possible route to the ball, making runs easier to score. It also lacks the capability to throw out a runner who is returning to a base (instead of advancing) or perform a double play after <b>catching</b> <b>a</b> fly ball. Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box.|$|E

5|$|Bradman rotated the two glovemen {{during the}} tour, and Tallon played in 14 of the 31 {{first-class}} matches, taking 29 catches and 14 stumpings. Tallon's catch of Len Hutton in the Fifth Test at The Oval {{was described as}} Wisden as {{the best of the}} year. He also took a difficult catch to remove George Emmett in the Third Test at Old Trafford, <b>catching</b> <b>a</b> ball that flew to his feet at yorker length. However, Tallon also had some mishaps, with finger injuries inflicted by failing to catch the ball correctly. Tallon had few opportunities with the bat, scoring 283 runs at a batting average of 25.72 in 13 first-class innings, including two fifties. During the Test, Tallon scored 112 runs at 28.00, including a 53 in the Second Test that saw Australia recover to a first innings of 350 after a middle-order slump had seen England take the upper hand. He took 12 catches in the Tests.|$|E
5|$|Following the kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense {{took the}} field badly needing {{to cut down}} Florida State's lead {{in order to allow}} enough time for a fourth-quarter comeback. This was not to be, however, as on the sixth play of the drive, wide {{receiver}} David Clowney fumbled the ball after <b>catching</b> <b>a</b> three-yard pass from Marcus Vick. The ball was successfully recovered by Florida State's Broderick Bunkley, thus giving Florida State another excellent chance to score from deep inside Virginia Tech territory. On the second play after the fumble, quarterback Drew Weatherford connected on a 22-yard strike to Greg Carr to drive inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. A five-yard facemask penalty against Virginia Tech only added to the Hokies' defensive problems, and twoplays later, Weatherford capped the drive with a six-yard touchdown pass to Chris Davis, expanding the Florida State lead to 273 with just 18seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Hornsby {{was again}} hired {{to manage the}} St. Louis Browns, his first major league job in 16 years. The Browns' owner, Bill Veeck, {{was the son of}} former Cubs {{president}} and general manager William Veeck, Sr. Hornsby was not well received by the players, however. On June9, he was fired due to a disagreement with Veeck over an incident against the Yankees the day before. During the game, a fan prevented Gil McDougald of the Yankees from <b>catching</b> <b>a</b> fly ball, and the umpire ruled that it was fan interference. Hornsby did not initially argue the call, and a few minutes later Veeck forced him to do it (when {{it was already too late}} to do anything about it). This led to Hornsby and the Browns parting ways. The Browns players were so happy about Hornsby's firing that they gave Veeck an engraved trophy to thank him.|$|E
50|$|Cooper also {{appeared}} in two Super Bowls for the 49ers, even <b>catching</b> <b>an</b> 11-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Joe Montana in Super Bowl XVI versus the Cincinnati Bengals. He ended {{his career with the}} Los Angeles Raiders in 1986.|$|R

5|$|In Alabama's {{first trip}} to Lexington since 2004, and their first road game of the 2009 season, the Tide {{defeated}} the Kentucky Wildcats 38–20. Alabama scored on their opening drive after Javier Arenas returned the opening kickoff 60 yards, which set up an 11-yard Mark Ingram touchdown for an early 7–0 lead. Kentucky responded {{with a pair of}} 49-yard Lones Seiber field goals. The score was 7–6 {{at the end of the}} first quarter. The Tide extended their lead late in the second quarter following a nearly seven-minute, 13-play, 97-yard touchdown drive. Greg McElroy passes of 27 and 21 yards and a 13-yard run by Ingram moved Bama down the field, culminating with a three-yard touchdown pass from McElroy to Colin Peek to put the Tide up 14–6. With only 40 seconds remaining in the half, Kentucky tailback Derrick Locke fumbled the ball after <b>catching</b> <b>a</b> short pass. Courtney Upshaw returned 45 yards for an Alabama touchdown that put the Tide ahead 21–6 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|In week six, the Giants {{hosted the}} Eagles at the Meadowlands. Linebacker Harry Carson scored his first career {{touchdown}} by <b>catching</b> <b>a</b> pass on a fake field {{goal in the}} third quarter, and the Giants defense sacked Eagles' quarterbacks Ron Jaworski and Randall Cunningham three times each. The Giants won 35–3; their largest margin of victory since they defeated the Seattle Seahawks, 32–0, in 1981. The Giants defense held the Eagles to 58 total yards, and Lawrence Taylor had four sacks and seven tackles. The sack total was Taylor's highest single game total since the 1984 season. The Giants dominated in time of possession; they held the ball for 39 minutes and 33 seconds to the Eagles 20 minutes and 27 seconds. Simms completed 20 of 29 passes for 214yards and two touchdowns and ran for another touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Kansas, {{which had}} won the pre-game coin toss, {{received}} the ball to open the second half. Todd Reesing initially began where he had left off in the first half, completing a pass to Dexton Fields for 12yards and a first down. On subsequent plays, however, Virginia Tech showed some of the defensive prowess that had been promoted heavily heading into the game. Aqib Talib was tackled for a loss of sixyards after <b>catching</b> <b>a</b> pass. Reesing was sacked under heavy pressure from the Tech defense. On third down, a Reesing pass was nearly intercepted by Cody Grimm, who knocked it down to force a Kansas punt. On the subsequent return, Virginia Tech earned its first big play of the game. Eddie Royal, who had returned every one of Virginia Tech's first-half kicks, received the ball and lateraled it to Justin Harper, who returned it 84yards for a touchdown. The score cut Kansas' lead to just three points with 11:35 remaining in the third quarter.|$|E
5000|$|... "Defusing a bomb" [...] - {{a player}} (usually the fullback) <b>catching</b> <b>an</b> {{opposing}} team's {{bomb in the}} in-goal area, and thus giving their team a 20-metre restart.

5|$|Lace {{confessed to}} the murder on 17 September 1983. He gave a {{statement}} to police that he had stolen a rucksack and cash on 4December 1979 from the care home in Portsmouth {{where he had been}} living and then walked to Southampton. He was present {{at the rear of the}} Tom Tackle pub when DeSimone was dropped off by Savage, and then approached DeSimone when she got into her own vehicle. He first knocked on the window and asked the time but then forced his way into the driver's seat beside her and locked the doors to prevent her escaping. Once inside he sexually assaulted her and strangled her using the passenger seatbelt in the car. He then took her handbag and jewellery, and hid for approximately 10minutes before heading to Southampton Central station and <b>catching</b> <b>a</b> train back to Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|The 1947 {{season was}} another strong one for Speedie. In {{a game against}} the Buffalo Bills, he tied a {{professional}} football record by <b>catching</b> <b>a</b> throw from Graham and running 99 yards for a touchdown. He finished the season as the league leader in receptions and receiving yards as the Browns won another championship. His 67 catches and 1,146 receiving yards, in fact, were the second-best in pro football history after Don Hutson of the Green Bay Packers, who caught for 1,211 yards in 1940. Speedie was named by news outlets as a first-team All-Pro. Speedie's success in 1947 came as he, Graham and Lavelli gelled as a passing and receiving unit, having studied hours of tape and worked on their technique and coordination. Speedie studied how defensive backs moved their feet and tried to break into the open by exploiting mis-steps. They experimented with screen passes and made modifications to common receiving routes to exploit the weaknesses of defenses.|$|E
5|$|The Browns won the AAFC {{championship}} {{again in}} 1947. Lavelli {{finished second in}} the league in receiving behind his teammate Speedie. Both Lavelli and Speedie were named to all-AAFC teams, as they had been in 1946. Lavelli broke his leg in a preseason game in 1948 and sat out seven weeks. He came back later in the year and helped Cleveland finish a perfect season, <b>catching</b> <b>a</b> touchdown pass in a 31–21 win over the AAFC's Brooklyn Dodgers in the championship game. In a game against the Los Angeles Dons the following year, Lavelli caught four touchdowns and had 209 receiving yards, an AAFC record. In 1949 Cleveland won the AAFC championship for the fourth year in a row. The AAFC dissolved before the 1950 season and three of its teams, including the Browns, were absorbed by the more established National Football League (NFL). Lavelli was the AAFC's all-time leader in yards per catch and second in receiving yards behind Speedie.|$|E
