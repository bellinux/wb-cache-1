40|$|This work {{describes}} the ﬁrst {{use of a}} direct nitrate analyser using <b>chromotropic</b> acid. A simpliﬁed <b>chromotropic</b> acid method eliminating several steps previously associated with this method is employed in the platform. In a sulphuric acid medium, <b>chromotropic</b> acid reacts with nitrate ions and produces a characteristic yellow colour associated with an absorbance band in the visible region (430 nm). The modiﬁed method allows for nitrate determination over the linear range 0. 9 – 80 mg/L nitrate with a limit of detection of 0. 73 mg/L nitrate. Validation was achieved by analysing water samples from various sources including groundwater, trade eﬄuent and drinking water by the modiﬁed method and by ion chromatography. The method was implemented on a ﬂow analysis platform incorporating a paired emitter–detector diode (PEDD) as the optical detector. An excellent correlation coeﬃcient of 0. 993 was obtained between the modiﬁed method and ion chromatography. The modiﬁed <b>chromotropic</b> acid method represents a rapid, simple, low cost technique for the direct determination of nitrate in water...|$|E

One of the most-commonly used spectrophotometric techniques {{for this purpose}} {{is based on the}} reaction with <b>chromotropic</b> acid.

Investigations for replacing the concentrated sulfuric acid with other acids or using more dilute solutions of sulfuric acid have been performed. Herein, spectrophotometric determination of formaldehyde by <b>chromotropic</b> acid in the sulfuric acid medium is explored and modified by response surface methodology. The reaction was monitored by measuring the absorbance of the product at 574 nm. The factors affecting the response, i. e. concentration of sulfuric acid and concentration of <b>chromotropic</b> acid, were explored and optimized using response surface methodology. The calibration curve was linear in the range of 0. 03 - 7. 00 mg l- 1 with detection limit of 0. 005 mg l- 1.

40|$|Plasmonic colour {{printing}} has drawn wide attention as a promising {{candidate for the}} next-generation colour-printing technology. However, an efficient approach to realize full colour and scalable fabrication is still lacking, which prevents plasmonic {{colour printing}} from practical applications.

More importantly, our approach also demonstrates controllable <b>chromotropic</b> capability, that is, the ability of reversible colour transformations. This <b>chromotropic</b> capability affords enormous potentials in building functionalized prints for anticounterfeiting, special label, and high-density data encryption storage.

40|$|A {{group of}} new non-symmetric viologens was {{synthesized}} and characterized spectrally using various techniques. These viologens contain active methylene moieties being capable {{to act as}} hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and interact in solution with various solvents, the latter acting as hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA). These specific solute-solvent interactions result in intense coloration of the resulting solutions. The <b>chromotropic</b> behavior of these compounds is triggered by basic solvents, and no significant change in color is observed in poorer HBA-solvents, such as several alcohols. The dependence {{of the color of}} the solutions on the polarity parameters of solvents (solvatochromism) was investigated. Solvent polarity parameters expressing both dipolarity/ polarizability and basicity of solvents have been used. Finally the correlation of the <b>chromotropic</b> behavior of these compounds with their structure is examined, using both experimental data and Hammett equation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The common {{causes of}} textile {{dermatitis}} are formaldehyde resins and disperse dyes. There are various methods {{to detect the}} presence of formaldehyde in clothing. AIM: To detect the presence of formaldehyde in various types of textiles by the <b>chromotropic</b> acid method and to assess the effect of washing on the formaldehyde content. METHODS: Twenty randomly selected textiles from a local cloth store were tested for formaldehyde by the <b>chromotropic</b> acid method. A purple ring indicated a positive reaction. The intensity of the purple ring was graded from 1 &#x 002 B; to 3 &#x 002 B; and reassessed after washing the clothes. RESULTS: Eleven out of the 20 textiles tested positive for formaldehyde.

40|$|Conventional textile {{coloration}} is a {{wet process}} involving {{high levels of}} water and chemicals consumption and wastewater generation. However, colour in textiles can also be generated by other mechanisms such as: absorption, emission, diffraction, interference and photochromism. [1] <b>Chromotropic</b> effect refers to reversible colour transformation due to external chemical or physical influence. [2] Photonic crystals are an important class of <b>chromotropic</b> materials. Colloidal crystals with a periodicity {{on the scale of}} half the wavelength of visible light exhibit structural colours similar to natural opals due to a diffraction effects that result in the appearance of a photonic band gap that forbids propagation of certain wavelengths. [3] Structural colouration is emerging as an innovative technology to produce colourful textiles materials. [4] Various colours impossible to reproduce by chemical coloration can be created by modifying the periodicity of the nanostructures or the environmental conditions using a single material. [5, 6] Photonic crystals can be applied on textile fabrics by colloid self-assembly and the structural colours can be controlled by adjusting the microspheres size and the viewing angles. [7] However, their application for textile structural coloration has been barely reported.

40|$|The {{distribution}} and acid-base behaviour {{of the four}} solutes harmine, <b>chromotropic</b> acid (4, 5 -dihydroxynaphthalene- 2, 7 -disulfonate, disodium salt), 2 -naphthol and 5, 10, 15, 20 -tetrakis [4 -trimethylammonium) phenyl]- 21 H, 23 H-porphine tetra-p-tosylate (TTMP) have been studied in water-in-oil (w/o) microemulsions using fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy. Carbon tetrachloride is a quencher of fluorescence of these compounds, and studies using this as oil phase in microemulsions show that <b>chromotropic</b> acid {{is located in the}} water domain, TTMP at the surfactant-water interface, while the distribution of harmine or 2 -naphthol depends on the degree of protonation. Detailed studies have been made on harmine. In water/AOT/cyclohexane microemulsions the cationic form is observed up to much higher apparent pH than in aqueous solutions. An important factor is shown to be the compartmentalisation of hydroxide ions between water pools. Similar effects are observed with the other probes, and it is suggested that compartmentalisation of hydrogen or hydroxide ions is a major effect in many acid-base reactions in microemulsions. The validity of the concept of pH in microemulsions under these conditions is questioned. Fluorescence lifetime measurements are also shown to provide information on the dynamics of the processes, and demonstrate the importance of diffusion of solutes from organic solvent to the microemulsion pool. A comparison is made of the behaviour of harmine in water/AOT/cyclohexane and water/lecithin/cyclohexane microemulsions. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Our {{ability to}} {{effectively}} monitor the aquatic environment is essential {{due to the}} increasing pressure on the environment from pollution, global climate change {{and the fact that}} water is an increasingly scarce natural resource. Nutrients such as nitrate and ammonia are essential for ecosystems but surplus levels of nutrients entering water bodies are a serious pollutant, causing eutrophication, contaminating drinking water and killing ecosystems which can cost nations up to $ 2. 2 billion per year. There is therefore a growing need for low cost, remote sensing systems which can be deployed in sufficiently large numbers to ensure that data on key water quality parameters is readily available. This project has the overall objective of developing low cost analytical platform for autonomous monitoring of environmental water quality.
