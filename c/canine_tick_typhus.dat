50|$|Rickettsia conorii is a Gram-negative, obligate {{intracellular}} bacterium of {{the genus}} Rickettsia that causes human disease called Boutonneuse fever, Mediterranean spotted fever, Israeli <b>tick</b> <b>typhus,</b> Astrakhan spotted fever, Kenya <b>tick</b> <b>typhus,</b> Indian <b>tick</b> <b>typhus,</b> or other names that designate the locality of occurrence while having distinct clinical features. It {{is a member of}} the spotted fever group and the most geographically dispersed species in the group, recognized in most of the regions bordering on the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, Israel, Kenya, and other parts of North, Central, and South Africa, and India. The prevailing vector is the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus. The bacterium was isolated by Emile Brumpt in 1932 and named after A. Conor who, in collaboration with A. Bruch, provided the first description of boutonneuse fever in Tunisia in 1910.|$|R
50|$|Rickettsia {{species are}} {{transmitted}} by numerous types of arthropod, including chigger, ticks, fleas, and lice, and {{are associated with}} both human and plant disease. Most notably, Rickettsia species are the pathogen responsible for: typhus, rickettsialpox, Boutonneuse fever, African tick bite fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Flinders Island spotted fever and Queensland <b>tick</b> <b>typhus</b> (Australian <b>tick</b> <b>typhus).</b> Despite the similar name, Rickettsia bacteria do not cause rickets, which {{is a result of}} vitamin D deficiency.

5000|$|Boutonneuse fever (also called Mediterranean spotted fever, fi√®vre boutonneuse, Kenya <b>tick</b> <b>typhus,</b> Indian <b>tick</b> <b>typhus,</b> Marseilles fever, or African tick-bite fever) is a fever as {{a result}} of a rickettsial {{infection}} caused by the bacterium Rickettsia conorii and transmitted by the dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Boutonneuse fever can be seen in many places around the world, although it is endemic in countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. This disease was first described in Tunisia in 1910 by Conor and Bruch and was named boutonneuse (French for [...] "spotty") due to its papular skin rash characteristics.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} unusual case of Rickettsia conorii {{infection}} that {{was associated with}} cutaneous papulovesicular lesions on a patient who had returned from the bushveld of South Africa. The lesions were diffusely scattered across the trunk, extremities, and both palms. Several recent reports have documented similar papulovesicular or pustulovesicular rashes that occurred on travelers returning from southern Africa. These rashes resemble the lesions of rickettsialpox. Evidence suggests that these atypical exanthems {{may be due to}} variant strains ofR. eonorii or to an unusual host response to infection with this organism; thus, infection with R. eonorii {{should be included in the}} list of diseases that cause poxlike lesions. The increase in international travel and the resultant in-crease in imported endemic infectious diseases make it imper-ative that clinicians be aware of the spectrum of presenta-tions of these infections. One such group of imported infections is the rickettsioses. <b>Tick</b> <b>typhus</b> (also referred to as boutonneuse fever, Mediterranean spotted fever, South Afri-can tickbite fever, Kenya <b>tick</b> <b>typhus,</b> or Indian <b>tick</b> <b>typhus...</b>|$|R

We demonstrate that Ixodes persulcatus ticks {{should be considered}} potential vectors of NATT.

40|$|Background: Though {{rickettsiosis}} {{is common}} in India, there is paucity of rickettsial retinitis (RR) reports from India. Moreover, rickettsial sub-types and their association with retinitis have not been studied. We are reporting a case series of presumed RR with their course of the disease, visual outcome, and association with rickettsial sub-type based on Weil-Felix test. Findings: This is a retrospective study of 19 eyes of 10 patients presented to a single institution. Cases diagnosed with presumed RR were identified from our database from March 2006 to October 2014 and studied retrospectively for patient‚Äôs demography, clinical presentation, and treatment. Patients with history of fever, retinitis, and a positive Weil-Felix test and a negative chikungunya and dengue serology were diagnosed as presumed rickettsial uveitis.

We tested serum samples with different rickettsial antigens from 11 patients and confirmed increasing titers of immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM to spotted fever group rickettsiae, including R. heilongjiangensis.

The antiprotein monoclonal antibodies {{were found to be}} directed against 29 distinct epitopes, which were located on the two major immunodominant proteins discussed above. Further analysis showed that strain-specific epitopes were located on the rOmpA protein and species- and subgroup-specific epitopes were located on the rOmpB protein. R. conorii Manuel, Indian <b>tick</b> <b>typhus</b> rickettsia, and Kenya <b>tick</b> <b>typhus</b> rickettsia also possessed all 29 epitopes, whereas the other rickettsiae of the spotted fever group (SFG) expressed between 3 and 25 epitopes, with the exception of Rickettsia helvetica, R. akari, and R. australis which did not possess any epitopes. Additional analyses by Western immunoblotting confirmed that the epitopes shared among the SFG rickettsiae were located on the same two high-molecular-mass proteins as on R. conorii. However, although epitopes on the R. conorii rOmpB protein were expressed on the rOmpB proteins of most other SFG rickettsiae, some were found on the rOmpA proteins of R. aeschlimannii, R. rickettsii, and R. rhipicephali. Both proteins possessing the common epitopes were found to have different sizes in the SFG rickettsial species. The different distributions of common epitopes in the SFG rickettsiae were also used to build a taxonomic dendrogram, which demonstrated that all the R. conorii strains formed a relatively independent cluster within the SFG rickettsiae and was generally consistent with previously proposed taxonomies...|$|R

No isolate {{has been associated with}} Thai <b>tick</b> <b>typhus</b> in humans, and TT- 118 was found only to be moderately pathogenic for guinea pigs and gerbils (1). However, evidence of spotted fever rickettsiosis has been seen in Thailand; this evidence comes from 2 reports of a total of 11 cases, 3 cases from Chiangmai and 8 cases from the Thailand-Burma border.

The gene encoding the R. rickettsii protein has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. We confirmed by 7. 5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of rickettsial lysates followed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody raised against the R. rickettsii protein that an analogous protein exists in R. conorii. Although these proteins were previously called 155 -kilodalton (kDa) proteins, we found that their apparent molecular masses were 198 kDa for R. conorii Kenya <b>tick</b> <b>typhus</b> and 190 kDa for R. rickettsii R. Using the R. rickettsii gene probe, we cloned and expressed a 5. 5 -kilobase HindIII fragment from R. conorii Kenya <b>tick</b> <b>typhus</b> genomic DNA in E. coli JM 107. The expressed recombinant product was recognized by a monospecific polyclonal rabbit antiserum prepared against the 198 -kDa protein. Guinea pigs immunized with sonic lysates of the E. coli strain expressing the recombinant gene product developed antibodies recognizing R. conorii when tested by a microimmunofluorescence antibody assay. Upon immunoblotting of rickettsial lysates, those antisera specifically recognized the 198 -kDa R. conorii protein and its 190 -kDa analog in R. rickettsii. Guinea pigs immunized with sonic lysates of the recombinant E. coli expressing the 198 -kDa protein were protected from experimental infections with the homologous R. conorii strain and partially protected from experimental infections with a strain of the heterologous species R. rickettsii.
