It is regularly used for authentic accompaniment of Tudor and baroque music.|$|E
5|$|Changing the bogies on a {{rail car}} takes hours and special, heavy equipment. In many cases (especially, {{containerized}} freight), freight is transshipped from one train to another instead {{of changing the}} bogies. As of 2016, this is what's usually done with China-Europe container trains at places such as Khorgos; it is reported that containers <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> from one train to another {{in as little as}} 47 minutes. In the case of liquids, frozen goods and hazardous materials, however, the bogies are usually changed.|$|E
5|$|However, {{even though}} on a per-individual basis, many other species are {{actually}} more efficient at pollinating, on the 30% of crop types where honey bees are used, most native pollinators cannot be mass-utilized as easily or {{as effectively as}} honey beesâ€”in many instances they will not visit the plants at all. Beehives <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> from crop to crop as needed, and the bees will visit many plants in large numbers, compensating via saturation pollination for what they lack in efficiency. The commercial viability of these crops is therefore strongly tied to the beekeeping industry. In China, hand pollination of apple orchards is labor-intensive, time consuming, and costly.|$|E

5|$|Stealth {{is based}} on {{limiting}} the player character's visibility; hiding behind objects and buildings, avoiding the enemies' cone of vision, and avoiding lighted areas aid in reducing detection. When hiding behind an object, the player can lean around the sides to see the immediate area and eavesdrop, {{and as long as}} Corvo remains hidden, his enemies will not see him. The player can also look through keyholes to gain insight into closed rooms. Sneaking up behind enemies allows the player to silently subdue them, and unconscious or dead bodies <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> and hidden.|$|E
5|$|Theme Park offers {{three levels}} of simulation: the higher {{difficulties}} requiring more management of aspects such as logistics. For example, at full level, the player must manage research, negotiations, stocks, and shares. On sandbox, the game does not involve those aspects. The player can switch mode at any time. Game time is implemented like a calendar: {{at the end of}} each year, the player is judged on that year's performance against rivals. Game speed can be adjusted, and staff <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> by the player. Cash awards may be earned for doing well, and trophies may be awarded for achievements such as having the longest roller coaster.|$|E

A roll of tissue adjacent to an implant (referred to as a palatal roll) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> towards the lip (buccal), gingiva from the palate can be transplanted, deeper connective tissue from the palate can be transplanted or, when a larger piece of tissue is needed, a finger of tissue based on a blood vessel in the palate (called a vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue (VIP-CT) flap) can be repositioned to the area.|$|E

5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E
5|$|Operations aboard oil tankers {{are governed}} by an {{established}} body of best practices and {{a large body of}} international law. Cargo <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> on or off of an oil tanker in several ways. One method is for the ship to moor alongside a pier, connect with cargo hoses or marine loading arms. Another method involves mooring to offshore buoys, such as a single point mooring, and making a cargo connection via underwater cargo hoses. A third method is by ship-to-ship transfer, also known as lightering. In this method, two ships come alongside in open sea and oil is transferred manifold to manifold via flexible hoses. Lightering is sometimes used where a loaded tanker is too large to enter a specific port.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an action-adventure puzzle-platformer. The player {{controls}} the main protagonist, an unnamed Prince from a kingdom in Persia. Environments are seen through a controllable third-person view. The camera's view changes to different positions triggered by entering certain areas or performing actions. The Prince <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> in all directions, {{and he is}} able to manipulate large objects such as blocks and levers connected to mechanisms. His health and power metre are represented in the top left-hand corner of the screen. The Prince restores health by drinking water from pools and fountains. Collecting Sands increases the Prince's power, and drinking from hidden magic fountains increases the Prince's maximum health. During several points in the game, the Prince is assisted by his companion Farah, who fires a bow at enemies, though her arrows can also hit the Prince if he strays into her line of fire. Monsters will attack her, and if she is killed, the game ends.|$|E

5|$|The game spans six levels, each lasting {{about five}} minutes, {{with a variety}} of boss battles. Over the course of the game, the plot is {{revealed}} through cutscenes using the game's own graphic engine. Gameplay consists of a player controlling a flying dragon and his rider through an aiming reticle that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> over the whole screen with the D-pad; the player must shoot a variety of enemies (ranging from machines to monsters) in a 3D post-apocalyptic fantasy environment of barren landscapes and mysterious ruins of a fallen civilization. Progression through the levels is made at a predetermined pace, as the player is constantly set along a rail of gameplay. The only time the game pauses is during boss battles. The field of vision can be directed with the aiming reticle on the x and y-axis, but the overall direction of travel is predetermined. The dragon follows the reticle movements, allowing the player to avoid enemy projectiles and obstacles.|$|E
5|$|The ship <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> {{horizontally}} and vertically, but not diagonally. The player makes a {{set number}} of steps each turn, after which the artificial intelligence does the same for non-playable characters (NPCs). If the player's ship is not docked at a port {{at the end of}} a turn, the player can be attacked by an enemy ship or a sea creature. If they are attacked, a card minigame is triggered to decide if the player loses gold to a rival ship or cargo to a sea creature. The player and NPC draw coloured and numbered cards; the highest-numbered card wins each turn, unless presented against a powerful color. The strongest hue receives an attack bonus. The player's following turn starts after the minigame is completed.|$|E
5|$|Winds can shape landforms, via {{a variety}} of aeolian {{processes}} such as the formation of fertile soils, such as loess, and by erosion. Dust from large deserts <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names {{in various parts of}} the world because of their significant effects on those regions. Wind also affects the spread of wildfires. Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations. When combined with cold temperatures, wind has a negative impact on livestock. Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.|$|E

5|$|Some {{molecules}} or {{particles are}} too large or too hydrophilic {{to pass through}} a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical. In both cases, these types of cargo <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> across the cell membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles. When a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents into the extracellular space, this process is known as exocytosis. In the reverse process, a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off, enclosing {{a portion of the}} extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell. Endocytosis and exocytosis rely on very different molecular machinery to function, but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other. The primary mechanism of this interdependence is the sheer volume of lipid material involved. In a typical cell, an area of bilayer equivalent to the entire plasma membrane will travel through the endocytosis/exocytosis cycle in about half an hour. If these two processes were not balancing each other, the cell would either balloon outward to an unmanageable size or completely deplete its plasma membrane within a matter of minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form of {{chromosomal}} crossover is homologous recombination, where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51. The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction, in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north-south cleavage. The north-south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east-west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.|$|E
