25|$|Ballpoint pens are {{sometimes}} provided free by businesses, such as hotels, {{as a form}} of advertising—printed with a company's name; a ballpoint pen is a relatively low cost advertisement that is highly effective (<b>customers</b> <b>will</b> use, and therefore see, a pen daily). Businesses and charities include ballpoint pens in direct mail campaigns to increase a customer's interest in the mailing. Ballpoints have also been produced to commemorate events, such as a pen commemorating the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.|$|E
30|$|If a {{customer}} establishes {{a contract with}} the CSP for DLC, He will give permission to the CSP to directly control the devices whenever it witnesses with critical periods, for instance, while He faces a technical or economic reason. For this purpose, the <b>customer</b> <b>will</b> be notified about the event, and receive remuneration based on the actual kWh reduction. If {{a customer}} makes a contract with CSP for Red. program, while the CSP decides to apply DR event, the <b>customer</b> <b>will</b> be notified for consumption reduction, and if it is accepted, he receives remuneration based on kWh reduction. Finally, if a customer has a RTP contract, it specifies a value of electricity price somehow that if the electricity price raises and is greater than that specific value, He will decrease the consumption {{as much as it is}} specified in the contract. This means that the <b>customer</b> <b>will</b> be notified about the real-time electricity price, and if He agrees to participate, He will reduce the consumption. In the RTP program, the <b>customer</b> <b>will</b> not earn remuneration for the consumption reduction, which means RTP program has no cost from CSP standpoint.|$|R

BT customers can currently purchase special phones {{that will allow them}} to block nuisance calls or pay to stop calls getting through. However, the new service will identify some of the 5 billion unwanted calls made each year before they arrive, which will then be diverted automatically to a junk voicemail box. BT <b>customers</b> <b>will</b> also be able to add numbers they don't want to hear from to the blacklist, for free.|$|E
25|$|The {{propulsion}} {{system of the}} RN ships will have a gas turbine direct drive and four high speed diesel generators driving two electric motors in a combined diesel-electric or gas (CODLOG) configuration. In 2012 Rolls Royce repackaged the MT30 used in the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers {{so that it would}} fit into smaller ships. The MT30 will be used in the Type 26. BAE Systems have suggested that some <b>customers</b> <b>will</b> install gas turbine engines and others will prefer to sacrifice 2–3 knots of speed by choosing cheaper diesel engines. The CODLOG configuration for propulsion is a simpler version of the Combined diesel-electric and gas (CODLAG) propulsion used on the Type 23 which this ship is to replace, and both of the Global Combat Ship's design contemporaries – the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier and the Type 45 destroyer – use integrated electric propulsion (IEP).|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} {{that are associated}} with finding your Target Market. One advantage is the “ability to offer the right product” (Suttle. R. 2016) through knowing the age and needs of the <b>customer</b> <b>willing</b> to purchase the item. Another advantage of Target Marketing assists businesses in understanding what price the <b>customer</b> <b>will</b> pay for the products or service. Businesses are also more efficient and effective at advertising their product, because they “reach the right consumers with messages that are more applicable” (Suttle. R. 2016).|$|R
50|$|The {{first step}} if any {{customer}} reference program is for an organisation to identify {{to whom it}} has sold a product, service or solution, and then to actively recruit satisfied customers.

25|$|Banking {{institutions}} in the United States are required to hold reservesamounts of currency and deposits in other banksequal to {{only a fraction of}} the amount of the bank's deposit liabilities owed to customers. This practice is called fractional-reserve banking. As a result, banks usually invest the majority of the funds received from depositors. On rare occasions, too many of the bank's <b>customers</b> <b>will</b> withdraw their savings and the bank will need help from another institution to continue operating; this is called a bank run. Bank runs can lead to a multitude of social and economic problems. The Federal Reserve System was designed as an attempt to prevent or minimize the occurrence of bank runs, and possibly act as a lender of last resort when a bank run does occur. Many economists, following Milton Friedman, believe that the Federal Reserve inappropriately refused to lend money to small banks during the bank runs of 1929.|$|E

500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Roper’s Green Gauge {{shows that a}} high {{percentage}} of consumers (42%) feel that environmental products don’t work as well as conventional ones.

500|$|The special {{was shot}} {{with a total of}} 13 Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's Epic Dragon camera line. Bennett and Gaga partnered with LG Electronic, who had also co-sponsored the concert. According to their deal, the concert started airing across all retail chains in the United States, on LG's 4K Ultra High-definition TV screens. Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga: Cheek to Cheek Live! became the first such concert to be {{streamed}} in 4K resolution. LG provided the streaming to dealers for in-store display on their HD TV screens. Dave VanderWaal, the company's head of marketing, said that [...] "thanks in part to LG's co-sponsorship, <b>customers</b> <b>will</b> be able to stream the performance in the highest resolution at no added cost." [...] VanderWaal further clarified that LG had been {{looking for a way to}} be upfront in the 4K market and found the option of streaming the concert for its customers as informative and lucrative.

500|$|Corzine was subpoenaed {{to appear}} before a House {{committee}} on December 8, 2011, to answer questions regarding 1.2 billion dollars of missing money from MF Global client accounts. He testified before the committee, [...] "I simply {{do not know where}} the money is, or why the accounts have not been reconciled to date", and that given the number of money transfers {{in the final days of}} trading at MF Global, he didn't know specifics of the movement of the funds. He also denied authorizing any misuse of customer funds. In March 2012, Bloomberg reported on a memo produced by congressional investigators that quoted an internal company e-mail relating to a $175 million transfer which was a subject of their investigation. Initial media reports suggested impropriety on Mr. Corzine's part, but this was later disproved. According to the New York Times, the employee responsible for the transfer e-mailed Mr. Corzine stating the transfer was a [...] "House Wire", meaning it came from the firm's own account. The instructions Mr. Corzine had given were to deal with several overdrafts at JPMorgan Chase, but never related to any specific accounts or specific transfers made. A spokesperson for Mr. Corzine responded that Corzine [...] "never directed Ms. O’Brien or anyone else regarding which account should be used to cure the overdrafts, and he never directed that customer funds should be used for that purpose. Nor was he informed that customer funds had been used for that purpose." [...] In fact, as the New York Times reported, Mr. Corzine had been given specific assurances that the transfer in question was proper, and that no customer funds had been used. Subsequent court filings also attest to this fact. On November 5, 2013 The New York Times reported that MF Global customers would likely recover 100 percent of their funds. A spokesman for Mr. Corzine said [...] "Mr. Corzine is very pleased that all <b>customers</b> <b>will</b> receive a full recovery. This is a great outcome, which has been anticipated for many months." [...] Customers have since received distributions making them whole.|$|E

40|$|Marketing {{concepts}} and definitions have remained relatively unchanged until recently. Electronic Customer Relationship Management (ECRM) has forced marketing managers to reevaluate how, when {{and to what}} extent they interact with their <b>customers.</b> Organizations <b>will</b> lose loyal <b>customers</b> if they do not recognize and react to the changing demands of customers. In addition, marketing to a new a <b>customer</b> <b>will</b> be more expensive and time consuming. Every <b>customer</b> <b>will</b> require something a little different and will want to know why one product is better over another product. Therefore, this paper is focused on the role of specific marketing {{concepts and}} how ECRM has enhanced or altered each concept. Every topic discussed is illustrated with current business examples. All business examples are used to demonstrate the success an organization can achieve when using ECRM to enhance marketing skills...|$|R
