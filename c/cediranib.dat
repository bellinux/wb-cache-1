Patients and Methods Eligible patients were initially randomly assigned 1 : 1 : 1 to receive <b>cediranib</b> (20 or 30 mg per day) or placebo plus FOLFOX/CAPOX. In an early analysis of this and two other <b>cediranib</b> studies (HORIZON I [Cediranib Plus FOLFOX 6 Versus Bevacizumab Plus FOLFOX 6 in Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer] and HORIZON III [Cediranib Plus FOLFOX 6 Versus Bevacizumab Plus FOLFOX 6 in Patients With Untreated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer]), the 20 -mg dose met the predefined criteria for continuation. Subsequent patients were randomly assigned 2 : 1 to the <b>cediranib</b> 20 mg or placebo arms. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were coprimary end points. Results In all, 860 patients received <b>cediranib</b> 20 mg (n = 502) or placebo (n = 358). The addition of <b>cediranib</b> to FOLFOX/CAPOX resulted in PFS prolongation (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 84; 95 % CI, 0. 73 to 0. 98; P =. 0121; median PFS, 8. 6 months for <b>cediranib</b> v 8. 3 months for placebo) but had no impact on OS (HR, 0. 94; 95 % CI, 0. 79 to 1. 12; P =. 5707; median OS, 19. 7 months for <b>cediranib</b> v 18. 9 months for placebo).

40|$|MRI {{biomarkers}} of tumor edema, vascular permeability, blood volume, {{and average}} vessel caliber {{are increasingly being}} employed to assess the efficacy of tumor therapies.

Here we examine the response of these MRI tumor biomarkers to <b>cediranib,</b> a potent vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor, in an orthotopic mouse glioma model. A significant increase in the tumor volume and relative vessel caliber index (rVCI) and a slight decrease in the water apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were observed for both control and <b>cediranib</b> treated animals. This contrasts with a clinical study that observed a significant decrease in tumor rVCI, ADC and volume with <b>cediranib</b> therapy.

40|$|PURPOSE Hypertension is a {{commonly}} reported adverse effect after administration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. <b>Cediranib</b> {{is a highly}} potent and selective VEGF signaling inhibitor of all three VEGFRs. This study prospectively investigated hypertension management to help minimize dose interruptions/reductions to maximize <b>cediranib</b> dose intensity. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients (n = 126) with advanced solid tumors {{were randomly assigned to}} one of four groups: <b>cediranib</b> 30 or 45 mg/d with or without antihypertensive prophylaxis. All patients developing hypertension on <b>cediranib</b> treatment were treated with a standardized, predefined hypertension management protocol. Results <b>Cediranib</b> was generally well tolerated, and all groups achieved high-dose intensities in the first 12 weeks (> 74 % in all groups). Antihypertensive prophylaxis did not result in fewer dose reductions or interruptions. Increases in blood pressure, including moderate and severe readings of hypertension, were seen early in treatment in all groups and successfully managed. Severe hypertension occurred in one patient receiving prophylaxis versus 18 in the nonprophylaxis groups. Overall, there were nine partial responses, and 38 patients experienced stable disease >/= 8 weeks. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this is the first prospective investigation of hypertension management during administration of a VEGF signaling inhibitor. All four regimens were well tolerated with high-dose intensities and no strategy was clearly superior. The current <b>cediranib</b> hypertension management protocol appears to be effective in managing hypertension compared with previous <b>cediranib</b> studies where no plan was in place, and early recognition and treatment of hypertension is likely to reduce the number of severe hypertension events.

40|$|PURPOSE: Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) /ERK {{signaling}} {{is critical}} for tumor cell proliferation and survival. Selumetinib is a potent, selective, and orally available MEK 1 / 2 inhibitor. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of selumetinib alone or with <b>cediranib,</b> an orally available potent inhibitor of all three VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinases, in murine orthotopic non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: NCI-H 441 or NCI-H 460 KRAS-mutant human NSCLC cells were injected into the lungs of mice. Mice {{were randomly assigned to}} treatment with selumetinib, <b>cediranib,</b> paclitaxel, selumetinib plus <b>cediranib,</b> or control. When controls became moribund, all animals were sacrificed and assessed for lung tumor burden and locoregional metastasis. Lung tumors and adjacent normal tissues were subjected to immunohistochemical analyses. RESULTS: Selumetinib inhibited lung tumor growth and, particularly at higher dose, reduced locoregional metastasis, as did <b>cediranib.</b> Combining selumetinib and <b>cediranib</b> markedly enhanced their antitumor effects, with near complete suppression of metastasis. Immunohistochemistry of tumor tissues revealed that selumetinib alone or with <b>cediranib</b> reduced ERK phosphorylation, angiogenesis, and tumor cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The antiangiogenic and apoptotic effects were substantially enhanced when the agents were combined. Selumetinib also inhibited lung tumor VEGF production and VEGFR signaling. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we evaluated therapy directed against MEK combined with antiangiogenic therapy in distinct orthotopic NSCLC models. MEK inhibition resulted in potent antiangiogenic effects with decreased VEGF expression and signaling. Combining selumetinib with <b>cediranib</b> enhanced their antitumor and antiangiogenic effects.

However, the current angiogenesis inhibitors used in clinical trials so far have shown limited effects on tumor growth and improvement in survival. <b>Cediranib</b> is an orally available small-molecule kinase inhibitor of all three VEGFR isoforms, with additional activity against PDGFRß and c-KIT. Its broad activities against critical targets, especially the anti-angiogenic activity, make <b>cediranib</b> an attractive option for therapy in central nervous system (CNS) tumors. <b>Cediranib</b> has shown promising anti-angiogenic efficacy in early clinical trials in glioblastoma (GBM), but its anti-tumor mechanisms {{and its effect on}} the efficacy of concurrent chemotherapies remain unclear. ATP-binding cassette transporters p-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) have been shown to work in concert to restrict brain penetration of several tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This study investigated the influence of P-gp and BCRP at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) on the CNS penetration of <b>cediranib.</b> Although in vitro studies suggest that both P-gp and BCRP significantly affect intracellular delivery of <b>cediranib,</b> in vivo data indicated that P-gp is a dominant efflux transporter for <b>cediranib</b> and BCRP plays a minor role in limiting transport of <b>cediranib</b> across the BBB. The interaction of <b>cediranib</b> with these brain efflux transporters could limit the antiangiogenic and anti-tumor action in cells in the brain parenchyma and might lead to poor iv outcomes in clinical trials. A more thorough understanding of the mechanisms controlling the delivery of <b>cediranib</b> to its targets will allow more efficacious use of this drug in GBM. To better understand the brain distributional kinetics, simulation strategies were employed to explore the appropriate ways to compare the true brain partitioning among different transporter deficient transgenic mouse groups, which, in general, helps in exploring the contribution of each drug transporter to the brain drug delivery. There are two partial-areas analyses utilized to determine the exit rate constant from the brain, the performances of which were evaluated and compared in the current study. The requirement for accurate determination of the brain-to-plasma ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) also warrants the investigation of a Bayesian approach to estimate the variability around the ∞ o AUC and the tissue-to-plasma ∞ o AUC ratio obtained by destructive sampling Since anti-angiogenic agents are commonly used in combination therapy for GBM, the influence of anti-angiogenic therapy on tumor delivery of traditional chemotherapy and molecularly-targeted agents was examined using a xenograft GBM model. It has been shown that restoration of the BBB integrity by <b>cediranib</b> and bevacizumab could decrease the tumor site delivery of both temozolomide and erlotinib, and even the delivery of <b>cediranib</b> itself, which could also be {{one of the reasons for}} the limited efficacy of <b>cediranib</b> in clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Background: The ICON 6 trial {{showed that}} <b>cediranib,</b> an oral {{inhibitor}} of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3, improved clinical outcomes {{in patients with}} platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, when used with chemotherapy and continued as maintenance therapy. This study describes health-related quality-of-life (QoL) {{during the first year}} of treatment. Methods: 456 women were randomly allocated to either receive standard chemotherapy only, chemotherapy with concurrent <b>cediranib,</b> or chemotherapy with <b>cediranib</b> concurrently and continued as maintenance. Patients completed QoL questionnaires until disease progression, 3 -weekly during chemotherapy and then 6 -weekly to one year. Patients alive with disease progression completed a QoL form at one year from randomisation. The primary QoL end point was the global score from the EORTC QLQ-C 30 at one year, comparing the standard chemotherapy group with the concurrent plus maintenance <b>cediranib</b> group. Results: Questionnaire compliance was 90 % at baseline, and 76 % at one year, similar across the three groups. Mean global QoL score at one year was 62. 6 points in the standard chemotherapy group and 68. 7 points in the concurrent plus maintenance group (+ 4. 5, 95 % CI - 2. 0 to 11. 0, p = 0. 18). Sensitivity analyses suggest this finding is robust to the effect of missing data, and the improvement became statistically significant after adjusting for self-reported diarrhoea. Conclusion: ICON 6 showed a significant improvement in PFS using <b>cediranib</b> as concurrent and maintenance therapy. We report no QoL detriment with <b>cediranib</b> one year after commencing treatment. Maintained QoL, alongside prolonged cancer control, suggest <b>cediranib</b> has a valuable role in the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cediranib,</b> a pan-tyrosine kinase {{inhibitor}} is showing promising {{results for the}} treatment of several solid tumours. In breast cancer, its effects remain unclear, and there are no predictive biomarkers. Several studies have examined the expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in response to different chemotherapy treatments and found that the expression patterns may be associated with the treatment response. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the cellular behaviour and differential expression profiles of miRNAs in breast cancer cell lines exposed to <b>cediranib.</b> The biological effect of this drug was measured by viability, migration, invasion and cell death in in vitro assays. Signaling pathways were assessed using a human phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array. Furthermore, using a miRNA array and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), we assessed the relative expression of miRNAs following <b>cediranib</b> treatment. The breast cancer cell lines exhibited a distinct cytotoxic response to <b>cediranib</b> treatment. <b>Cediranib</b> exposure resulted in a decrease in the cell migration and invasion of all the breast cancer cell lines. Treatment with <b>cediranib</b> appeared to be able to modulate the activation of several RTKs that are targets of <b>cediranib</b> such as EGFR and a new potential target ROR 2. Furthermore, this drug was able to modulate the expression profile of different microRNAs such as miR- 494, miR- 923, miR- 449 a, miR- 449 b and miR- 886 - 3 in breast cancer cell lines. These miRNAs are reported to regulate genes involved in important molecular processes, according to bioinformatics prediction tools. We would like to thank Olga Martinho and Celine Pinheiro for assisting in the cellular experiments.

40|$|Solid tumors {{express a}} range of factors {{required}} to sustain their growth and promote their dissemination. Among these are vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), the key angiogenic stimulant, and VEGF-C, a primary mediator of lymphangiogenesis.

However, their potency toward individual targets can vary. <b>Cediranib</b> (RECENTIN; AZD 2171) is an inhibitor of VEGF signaling that {{has been shown in}} experimental models to prevent VEGF-A– induced angiogenesis and primary tumor growth, yet the effects of <b>cediranib</b> on VEGF receptor (VEGFR) - 3 –mediated endothelial cell function and lymphangiogenesis are un-known.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The ICON 6 trial {{showed that}} <b>cediranib,</b> an oral {{inhibitor}} of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, improved clinical outcomes {{for patients with}} platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer when it was used with chemotherapy and was continued as maintenance therapy. This study describes health-related quality of life (QOL) {{during the first year}} of treatment. METHODS: Four hundred fifty-six women were randomly allocated to receive standard chemotherapy only, chemotherapy with concurrent <b>cediranib,</b> or chemotherapy with <b>cediranib</b> administered concurrently and continued as maintenance. Patients completed QOL questionnaires until disease progression every 3 weeks during chemotherapy and then every 6 weeks to 1 year. Patients alive with disease progression completed a QOL form 1 year after randomization. The primary QOL endpoint was the global score from the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) at 1 year, with the standard chemotherapy group compared with the concurrent-maintenance <b>cediranib</b> group. RESULTS: The rate of questionnaire compliance was 90 % at the baseline and 76 % at 1 year and was similar across the 3 groups. The mean global QOL score at 1 year was 62. 6 points for the standard chemotherapy group and 68. 7 points for the concurrent-maintenance group (+ 4. 5; 95 % confidence interval, – 2. 0 to 11. 0; P =. 18). Sensitivity analyses suggested that this finding was robust to the effect of missing data, and the improvement became statistically significant after adjustments for self-reported diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: The 6 th study by the International Collaboration in Ovarian Neoplasm (ICON 6) showed a significant improvement in progression-free survival with <b>cediranib</b> as concurrent and maintenance therapy. No QOL detriment with <b>cediranib</b> was found 1 year after treatment was commenced. The maintenance of QOL along with prolonged cancer control suggests that <b>cediranib</b> has a valuable role in the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer...|$|E
40|$|In {{malignant}} pleural mesothelioma, targeting angiogenesis with <b>cediranib,</b> a vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitor, may have therapeutic potential. S 0905 phase I combined <b>cediranib</b> (two dose cohorts [30 mg and 20 mg daily]) with cisplatin-pemetrexed for six cycles followed by maintenance <b>cediranib</b> in unresectable chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma of any histologic subtype. The primary end point established the {{maximum tolerated dose}} in combination with cisplatin-pemetrexed in a dose deescalation scheme. A total of 20 patients were enrolled (seven to the 30 -mg cohort and 13 to the 20 -mag cohort). In the <b>cediranib</b> 30 -mg cohort, two of the initial six patients reported dose-limiting toxicities and the dose was deemed too toxic to continue. In the next cohort, two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities, and thus, the maximum tolerated dose of <b>cediranib</b> was established as 20 mg. During the six cycles of cisplatin-pemetrexed-cediranib, 20 mg, there were grade 3 toxicities (neutropenia and gastrointestinal) and grade 4 thrombocytopenia. No patients had any significant episodes of bleeding. According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (n = 17 evaluable patients), the median progression-free survival was 12. 8 months (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 6. 9 - 17. 2); according to the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (n = 19 evaluable patients), the median progression-free survival was 8. 6 months (95 % CI: 6. 1 - 10. 9). For all patients, the disease control rate at 6 weeks was 90 % and median overall survival time was 16. 2 months (95 % CI: 10. 5 - 28. 7). <b>Cediranib</b> combined with cisplatin-pemetrexed has a reasonable toxicity profile and preliminary promising efficacy. The phase II S 0905 trial will evaluate {{the efficacy of the}} triplet regimen compared with the current standard of care, cisplatin-pemetrexed...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionMalignant pleural {{mesothelioma}} (MPM) tumors express vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptors. We conducted a phase II {{study of the}} oral pan-VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, <b>cediranib,</b> in patients with MPM after platinum-based systemic chemotherapy. MethodsPatients with MPM previously treated with a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen and a performance status 0 to 2 were eligible for enrollment. <b>Cediranib</b> 45 mg/d was administered until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was response rate. Tumor measurements were made by RECIST criteria, with a subset analysis conducted using modified RECIST. A two-stage design with an early stopping rule based on response rate was used. ResultsFifty-four patients were enrolled. Of 47 evaluable patients, 4 patients (9 %) had objective responses, 16 patients (34 %) had stable disease, 20 patients (43 %) had disease progression, 2 patients (4 %) had symptomatic deterioration, and 1 patient (2 %) had early death. The most common toxicities were fatigue (64 %), diarrhea (64 %), and hypertension (70 %); 91 % of patients required a dose reduction. Median overall survival was 9. 5 months, 1 -year survival was 36 %, and median progression-free survival was 2. 6 months. ConclusionCediranib monotherapy has modest single-agent activity in MPM after platinum-based therapy. However, some patient tumors were highly sensitive to <b>cediranib.</b> This study provides a rationale for further testing of <b>cediranib</b> plus chemotherapy in MPM and highlights the need to identify a predictive biomarker for <b>cediranib...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractTreatment for {{glioblastoma}} {{consists of}} radiotherapy and temozolomide-based chemotherapy. However, virtually all patients recur, {{leading to a}} fatal outcome. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) -targeted therapy {{has been the focus}} of attention in novel treatment options for these patients. Here, we compared the efficacy of imatinib, sunitinib, and <b>cediranib</b> in glioblastoma models. In the present work, the biologic effect of the drugs was screened by viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and invasion in vitro assays or in vivo by chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Intracellular signaling was assessed by Western blot and the RTK targets were identified using phospho-RTK arrays. The amplified status of KIT, PDGFRA, and VEGFR 2 genes was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In a panel of 10 glioblastoma cell lines, we showed that <b>cediranib</b> was the most potent. In addition, <b>cediranib</b> and sunitinib synergistically sensitize the cells to temozolomide. <b>Cediranib</b> efficacy was shown to associate with higher cytostatic and unique cytotoxic effects in vitro and both antitumoral and antiangiogenic activity in vivo, which could associate with its great capacity to inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT pathways. The molecular status of KIT, PDGFRA, and VEGFR 2 did not predict glioblastoma cell responsiveness to any of the RTK inhibitors. Importantly, phospho-RTK arrays revealed novel targets for <b>cediranib</b> and sunitinib therapy. In conclusion, the novel targets found may be of value as future biomarkers for therapy response in glioblastoma and lead to the rational selection of patients for effective molecular targeted treatment...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Cediranib</b> is a multi-tyrosine kinase {{inhibitor}} targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors. This phase II {{study was conducted}} to assess activity and tolerability of single-agent <b>cediranib</b> in recurrent/persistent endometrial cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer after receiving one or two prior cytotoxic regimens, measurable disease, and Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) performance status of ≤ 2 (≤ 1 if two prior cytotoxic regimens given). <b>Cediranib</b> 30 mg orally daily for a 28 daycycle was administered until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity. Microvessel density (MVD) was measured in tumor tissue from initial hysterectomy specimens and correlated with clinical outcome. Primary endpoints were tumor response and surviving progression-free for six months without subsequent therapy (6 -month event-free survival [EFS]). RESULTS: Of 53 patients enrolled, 48 were evaluable for <b>cediranib</b> efficacy and toxicity. Median age was 65. 5 years, 52 % of patients had received prior radiation, and 73 % of patients received only one prior chemotherapy regimen. A partial response was observed in 12. 5 %. Fourteen patients (29 %) had six-month EFS. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3. 65 months and median overall survival (OS) 12. 5 months. No grade 4 or 5 toxicities were observed. A trend towards improved PFS was found in patients whose tumors expressed high MVD. CONCLUSION: <b>Cediranib</b> as a monotherapy treatment for recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer is well tolerated and met protocol set objectives for sufficient activity to warrant further investigation. MVD may be a useful biomarker for activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{vascular}} endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ligands and <b>cediranib</b> on tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion was determined. It {{has recently been}} suggested that autocrine signaling through the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) pathway {{may play a role}} in tumor cell survival, invasion, and migration. The purpose of the present study was to determine the expression of VEGFRs and VEGFR ligands in a panel of gastrointestinal carcinoma cells. Additionally, we evaluated the effects of VEGF autocrine signaling on tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion utilizing <b>cediranib</b> (AZD 2171), a pan-VEGFR inhibitor. Five colorectal, three pancreatic, and two hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines were screened for VEGFR and VEGF expression by several methods. Expression of VEGFR- 1 and VEGFR- 3 was cell line-dependent, whereas VEGFR- 2 was not detected. Secretion of VEGF-A was detected in the supernatants of all cell lines whereas VEGF-C secretion was detected in the Panc- 1, MiaPaca 2, and Hep 1 cells only. Tumor cells showed increased migratory activity, but not proliferation, when stimulated with VEGFs. The pan-VEGFR inhibitor <b>cediranib</b> (100 nmol/L) inhibited tumor cell migration and invasion, with no effects on proliferation. <b>Cediranib</b> decreased VEGFR- 1 and VEGFR- 3 phosphorylation as well as activation of downstream effectors. VEGFR- 1 and VEGFR- 3 expression was detected in all the gastrointestinal carcinoma cells evaluated. Although activation of the VEGF pathway did not affect cell proliferation, our data indicate that this pathway seems to play a role in tumor cell migration and invasion in these cell lines. Therefore, inhibition of VEGFR by <b>cediranib</b> may represent a clinically relevant treatment option for gastrointestinal tumors...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} {{reported that the}} in vivo anti-glioma efficacy of the anti-angiogenic receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor <b>cediranib</b> is substantially enhanced via combination with the late-stage autophagy inhibitor quinacrine. The current study investigates the role of hypoxia and autophagy in combined cediranib/quinacrine efficacy. EF 5 immunostaining revealed a prevalence of hypoxia in mouse intracranial 4 C 8 glioma, consistent with high-grade glioma. MTS cell viability assays using 4 C 8 glioma cells revealed that hypoxia potentiated the efficacy of combined cediranib/quinacrine: cell viability reductions induced by 1 µM <b>cediranib</b> + 2. 5 µM quinacrine were 78 ± 7 % (hypoxia) vs. 31 ± 3 % (normoxia), p< 0. 05. Apoptosis was markedly increased for cediranib/quinacrine/hypoxia versus all other groups. Autophagic vacuole biomarker LC 3 -II increased robustly in response to <b>cediranib,</b> quinacrine, or hypoxia. Combined cediranib/quinacrine increased LC 3 -II further, with the largest increases occurring with combined cediranib/quinacrine/hypoxia. Early stage autophagy inhibitor 3 -MA prevented LC 3 -II accumulation with combined cediranib/quinacrine/hypoxia and substantially attenuated the associated reduction in cell viability. Combined efficacy of <b>cediranib</b> with bafilomycin A 1, another late-stage autophagy inhibitor, was additive but lacked substantial potentiation by hypoxia. Substantially lower LC 3 -II accumulation was observed with bafilomycin A 1 in comparison to quinacrine. <b>Cediranib</b> and quinacrine each strongly inhibited Akt phosphoryation, while bafilomycin A 1 had no effect. Our results provide compelling evidence that autophagic vacuole accumulation plays a causal role in the anti-glioma cytotoxic efficacy of combined cediranib/quinacrine. Such accumulation is likely related to stimulation of autophagosome induction by hypoxia, which is prevalent in the glioma tumor microenvironment, as well as Akt signaling inhibition from both <b>cediranib</b> and quinacrine. Quinacrine's unique ability to inhibit both Akt and autophagic vacuole degradation may enhance its ability to drive cytotoxic autophagic vacuole accumulation. These findings provide a rationale for a clinical evaluation of combined cediranib/quinacrine therapy for malignant glioma...|$|E
