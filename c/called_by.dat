At the time, Nelson had not written any new material. He returned to Nashville, where he wrote new songs to use with others from his old repertoire. These new concept songs were recorded in two days.|$|E
5|$|Although the Sejm was {{supposed}} to meet every 2 years, only four sessions were <b>called</b> <b>by</b> the Tsar as it became the scene of increased clashes between liberal deputies and conservative government officials. With regards to the years the Sejm met, Bardach gives the dates of 1818, 1820, 1823 and 1830; Jędruch offers a similar list, however lists 1825 instead of 1823.|$|E

5|$|Cushion caroms, {{sometimes}} <b>called</b> <b>by</b> {{its original}} name, the indirect game, is traceable to 1820's Britain {{and is a}} descendant of the doublet game dating to at least 1807. The game is {{sometimes referred to as}} one-cushion or one-cushion billiards, which is the direct translation of its name into English from various other languages such as Spanish ("una banda") and German ("einband").|$|E
50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>by</b> {{need is a}} memoized {{version of}} <b>call</b> <b>by</b> name where, if the {{function}} argument is evaluated, that value is stored for subsequent uses. In a “pure“ (effect-free) setting, this produces the same results as <b>call</b> <b>by</b> name; when the function argument is used two or more times, <b>call</b> <b>by</b> need is almost always faster.|$|R
50|$|Jensen's device {{exploits}} <b>call</b> <b>by</b> {{name and}} side-effects. <b>Call</b> <b>by</b> name {{is an argument}} passing convention that delays the evaluation of an argument until it is actually used in the procedure (a consequence of the copy rule for procedures). Algol introduced <b>call</b> <b>by</b> name.|$|R
50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>by</b> {{reference}} can be simulated in languages {{that use}} <b>call</b> <b>by</b> value and don't exactly support <b>call</b> <b>by</b> reference, by {{making use of}} references (objects that refer to other objects), such as pointers (objects representing the memory addresses of other objects). Languages such as C and ML use this technique. It is not a separate evaluation strategy—the language <b>calls</b> <b>by</b> value—but sometimes it {{is referred to as}} <b>call</b> <b>by</b> address (also referred to as pass by address). In an unsafe language like C this may cause memory safety errors such as null pointer dereferences, and also may be confusing. In ML references are type- and memory- safe.|$|R
5|$|English-language {{regional}} {{rights were}} previously held by Sportsnet East (with CJNT City Montreal as an overflow channel), under a 3-year deal that expired after the 2016–17 season; {{the games were}} <b>called</b> <b>by</b> Bartlett and Jason York.

5000|$|<b>Call</b> <b>by</b> sharing (also {{referred}} to as <b>call</b> <b>by</b> object or <b>call</b> <b>by</b> object-sharing) is an evaluation strategy first named by Barbara Liskov et al. for the language CLU in 1974. It is used by languages such as Python, Iota, Java (for object references), Ruby, JavaScript, Scheme, OCaml, AppleScript, and many others. However, the term [...] "call by sharing" [...] is not in common use; the terminology is inconsistent across different sources. For example, in the Java community, they say that Java is <b>call</b> <b>by</b> value. <b>Call</b> <b>by</b> sharing implies that values in the language are based on objects rather than primitive types, i.e. that all values are [...] "boxed".|$|R
50|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{many modern}} programming languages have converged on a call-by-value/call-by-reference evaluation strategy for function calls (C#, Java). Some languages, especially lower-level languages such as C++, combine several notions of parameter passing. Historically, <b>call</b> <b>by</b> value and <b>call</b> <b>by</b> name {{date back to}} ALGOL 60, a language designed in the late 1950s. <b>Call</b> <b>by</b> reference is used by PL/I and some Fortran systems. Purely functional languages like Haskell, as well as non-purely functional languages like R, use <b>call</b> <b>by</b> need.|$|R

5|$|In the mid-15th {{century the}} general sejm of the Kingdom of Poland met about once per year. There was no set time span to elapse {{before the next}} session was to be <b>called</b> <b>by</b> the king.

5|$|Initially, {{concerns}} for secrecy kept the military designation of the Katyushas from being {{known by the}} soldiers who operated them. They were <b>called</b> <b>by</b> code names such as Kostikov guns, after {{the head of the}} RNII, the Reaction-Engine Scientific Research Institute, and finally classed as Guards Mortars. The name BM-13 was only allowed into secret documents in 1942, and remained classified until after the war.|$|E
5000|$|Block structure, with {{underlying}} semantics (including recursion), à la Algol 60. Arguments {{are passed}} using <b>call</b> <b>by</b> reference, using dummy variables for values where needed (<b>call</b> <b>by</b> value).|$|R
5000|$|The {{semantics}} of <b>call</b> <b>by</b> copy-restore {{also differ}} from those of <b>call</b> <b>by</b> reference where two or more function arguments alias one another; that is, point to the same variable in the caller's environment. Under <b>call</b> <b>by</b> reference, writing to one will affect the other; <b>call</b> <b>by</b> copy-restore avoids this by giving the function distinct copies, but leaves the result in the caller's environment undefined depending on which of the aliased arguments is copied back first—will the copies be made in left-to-right order both on entry and on return? ...|$|R
50|$|Vervet monkeys are {{the typical}} example of both animal alarm calls and of {{semantic}} capacity in non-human animals. They have three distinct calls for leopards, snakes, and eagles, and {{research shows that}} each call elicits different responses. When vervets {{are on the ground}} they respond to the eagle alarm <b>call</b> <b>by</b> looking up and running to cover, to leopard alarm <b>calls</b> primarily <b>by</b> looking up and running into a tree, and to the snake alarm <b>call</b> primarily <b>by</b> looking down. When in trees vervets responded to the eagle alarm <b>call</b> <b>by</b> looking up and down and running out of trees, to the leopard alarm <b>call</b> <b>by</b> running higher in the tree and looking both up and down, and to the snake alarm <b>call</b> <b>by</b> looking primarily down.|$|R
5|$|One day {{somebody}} in the crowd identified me. Standing behind me was a woman, with lips blue from cold, who had, of course, never heard me <b>called</b> <b>by</b> name before.

5|$|Sometime around 3:00 PM local time, an {{emergency}} drivers' meeting was <b>called</b> <b>by</b> series director Brian Barnhart. After the meeting ended, Randy Bernard {{met with the}} media.

50|$|For {{immutable}} objects, {{there is}} no real difference between <b>call</b> <b>by</b> sharing and <b>call</b> <b>by</b> value, except if object identity is visible in the language. The use of <b>call</b> <b>by</b> sharing with mutable objects is an alternative to input/output parameters: the parameter is not assigned to (the argument is not overwritten and object identity is not changed), but the object (argument) is mutated.|$|R
50|$|Optimistic {{evaluation}} is another variant of <b>call</b> <b>by</b> need {{in which the}} function's argument is partially evaluated for some amount of time (which may be adjusted at runtime), after which {{evaluation is}} aborted and the function is applied using <b>call</b> <b>by</b> need. This approach avoids some of the runtime expense of <b>call</b> <b>by</b> need, while still retaining the desired termination characteristics.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{languages}} support <b>call</b> <b>by</b> {{reference in}} some form or another, but comparatively few use it as a default. FORTRAN II is an early example of a call-by-reference language. A few languages, such as C++, PHP, Visual Basic [...]NET, C# and REALbasic, default to <b>call</b> <b>by</b> value, but offer special syntax for call-by-reference parameters. C++ additionally offers <b>call</b> <b>by</b> reference to const.|$|R

5|$|The Eccles Spinning and Manufacturing Company {{came into}} being {{following}} a meeting <b>called</b> <b>by</b> the Mayor of Eccles, in which concern was expressed at the decline in local industry. Two earlier Eccles mills had been destroyed by fire, resulting in significant local unemployment. Designed by Potts, Son and Hennings of Manchester, Bolton and Oldham, it was opened in 1906. The imposing mill contained a multi-storey spinning mill, engine house and extensive weaving sheds.|$|E
50|$|Call-by-name {{evaluation}} is occasionally preferable to call-by-value evaluation. If a function's argument {{is not used}} in the function, <b>call</b> <b>by</b> name will save time by not evaluating the argument, whereas <b>call</b> <b>by</b> value will evaluate it regardless. If the argument is a non-terminating computation, the advantage is enormous. However, when the function argument is used, <b>call</b> <b>by</b> name is often slower, requiring a mechanism such as a thunk.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Call</b> <b>by</b> copy-restore (also {{referred}} to as copy-in copy-out, <b>call</b> <b>by</b> value result or <b>call</b> <b>by</b> value return—as termed in the Fortran community) is a special case of <b>call</b> <b>by</b> reference where the provided reference is unique to the caller. This variant has gained attention in multiprocessing contexts and Remote procedure call : if a parameter to a function call is a reference that might be accessible by another thread of execution, its contents may be copied to a new reference that is not; when the function call returns, the updated contents of this new reference are copied {{back to the original}} reference ("restored").|$|R
50|$|Programming {{languages}} {{that employ}} <b>call</b> <b>by</b> value semantics provide a called subroutine {{with its own}} local copy of the arguments passed to it. In most languages, these local parameters are treated the same as other local variables within the subroutine. In contrast, <b>call</b> <b>by</b> reference and <b>call</b> <b>by</b> name semantics allow the parameters to act as aliases of the values passed as arguments, allowing the subroutine to modify variables outside its own scope.|$|R
