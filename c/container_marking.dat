50|$|Food {{rotation}} {{is important}} to preserve freshness. When food is rotated, the food {{that has been in}} storage the longest is used first. As food is used, new food is added to the pantry to replace it; the essential rationale is to use the oldest food as soon as possible so that nothing is in storage too long and becomes unsafe to eat. Labelling food with paper labels on the storage <b>container,</b> <b>marking</b> the date that the container is placed in storage, can make this practice simpler. The best way to rotate food storage is to prepare meals with stored food on a daily basis.|$|E

40|$|Amgen is {{implementing}} new capabilities {{across the}} Amgen manufacturing network {{in order to}} code containers at the unit-level to reduce the possibility of mix-ups of unlabeled drug products. In order {{to prepare for the}} roll-out of these new capabilities, an assessment of the impact to throughput, packaging yield and eject rates was conducted. Discrete event simulation was utilized {{to assess the impact of}} implementing these new <b>container</b> <b>marking</b> capabilities on a vial inspection and packaging line at one of Amgen's key manufacturing sites. The impact assessment confirms that the new capabilities will have no impact to the throughput of the production line and minimal to no impact on packaging yield and eject rates. This assessment provides confidence that implementation can move forward without concerns of negative impacts to the production lines. by Iris Marie Zielske. Thesis: S.

40|$|Introduction:Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} detection of nodal metastasis during radical cystectomy with standard pelvic lymph node dissection versus en bloc lymphadenectomy {{for the treatment of}} bladder cancer. Materials And Methods: Hospital records of a total of 77 Patients with radical cystectomy and either standard pelvic lymph node dissection or en bloc lymphadenectomy were reviewed. Nodal dissection specimens during standard lymphadenectomy were sent for pathology examination in 6 separate <b>containers</b> <b>marked</b> as external iliac, internal iliac, and obturator groups from both sides. En bloc dissection specimens were sent in 2 <b>containers</b> <b>marked</b> as {{the right and the left}} pelvic nodes. Clinical and pathological findings of these two groups were compared in terms of the number of dissected lymph nodes, number of nodes with metastasis, lymph node density, and clinical outcomes. Results: There were 34 Patients with standard lymph node dissection and 43 with en bloc lymphadenectomy (anterior pelvic exenteration). Age, sex, duration of the disease, number of transurethral resections prior to cystectomy, pathological grade at cystectomy, and stage of the primary tumor were comparable in the two groups of Patients.

50|$|Every year some 1.4 billion insulin {{syringes}} {{are used}} in the United States. Accidental needlesticks occur through improper 'pre-disposal' handling and transport of used needles by the patients themselves, their relatives, friends, or medical staff. Accidents can occur during waste transport and treatment as well as at recycling facilities and landfills. For these victims, each accidental needlestick causes not only a puncture wound but also the fear of possible secondary infection. The risk of accidental puncture wounds can be reduced by properly disposing of the needle in a <b>container</b> <b>marked</b> sharps medical waste.

However, displaying the USDA grade was not required. Washington state, a major apple producer, used apple standards superior to those used by the USDA.
