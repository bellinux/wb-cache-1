A placebo-controlled study of nitazoxanide in cryptosporidiosis demonstrated significant clinical improvement in adults and children with mild illness. Among malnourished children in Zambia with <b>chronic</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis,</b> a three-day course of therapy led to clinical and parasitologic improvement and improved survival. In Zambia and in a study conducted in Mexico, nitazoxanide was not successful {{in the treatment of}} cryptosporidiosis in advanced infection with human immunodeficiency virus at the doses used. However, it was effective in patients with higher CD4 counts. In treatment of giardiasis, nitazoxanide was superior to placebo and comparable to metronidazole. Nitazoxanide was successful in the treatment of metronidazole-resistant giardiasis. Studies have suggested efficacy in the treatment of cyclosporiasis, isosporiasis, and amebiasis.|$|E
40|$|Aside from {{effective}} antiretroviral therapy, {{there is}} no consistently effective antiparasitic therapy for cryptosporidiosis in AIDS. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess safety, efficacy, and durability of combination therapy with paromomycin and azithromycin for <b>chronic</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis.</b> Patients with AIDS, <b>chronic</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis,</b> and 100 CD 4 cells/mL were treated with open-label paromo-mycin (1. 0 g twice a day) plus azithromycin (600 mg once a day) for 4 weeks, followed by paromomy-cin alone for 8 weeks. In 11 patients, median stool frequency decreased from 6. 5 /day (baseline) to 4. 9 /day (week 4) and 3. 0 /day (week 12). Median reductions in 24 -h oocyst excretion were 84 %, 95 %, and 99 % at 2, 4, and 12 weeks, respectively. None of the responses were attributable to antiretrovi-rals. Of 5 survivors at 12 – 30 months of follow-up, 3 remain asymptomatic off medications, and 2 have chronic, mild diarrhea. Treatment of cryptosporidiosis with azithromycin and paromomycin was associated with significant reduction in oocyst excretion and some clinical improvement. Cryptosporidium parvum, an intracellular protozoan parasite, AIDS-related cryptosporidiosis, azithromycin monotherapy has been ineffective [7, 8]. In clinical practice, azithromycin hasis a frequent cause of chronic diarrhea in human immunodefi-ciency virus (HIV) –infected patients, resulting in significant frequently been used in combination with paromomycin for treatment of cryptosporidiosis [9], but the safety and efficacymorbidity and mortality. <b>Chronic</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> occurs whe...|$|E

40|$|Nitazoxanide (NTZ), a drug {{currently}} {{being tested in}} human clinical trials for efficacy against <b>chronic</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis,</b> was assessed in cell culture and in two animal models. The inhibitory activity of NTZ was {{compared with that of}} paromomycin (PRM), a drug that is partially effective against Cryptosporidium parvum. A concentration of 10 μg of NTZ/ml (32 μM) consistently reduced parasite growth in cell culture by more than 90 % with little evidence of drug-associated cytotoxicity, in contrast to an 80 % reduction produced by PRM at 2, 000 μg/ml (3. 2 mM). In contrast to its efficacy in vitro, NTZ at either 100 or 200 mg/kg of body weight/day for 10 days was ineffective at reducing the parasite burden in C. parvum-infected, anti-gamma-interferon-conditioned SCID mice. Combined treatment with NTZ and PRM was no more effective than treatment with PRM alone. Finally, NTZ was partially effective at reducing the parasite burden in a gnotobiotic piglet diarrhea model when given orally for 11 days at 250 mg/kg/day but not at 125 mg/kg/day. However, the higher dose of NTZ induced a drug-related diarrhea in piglets that might have influenced its therapeutic efficacy. As we have previously reported, PRM was effective at markedly reducing the parasite burden in piglets at a dosage of 500 mg/kg/day. Our results indicate that of all of the models tested, the piglet diarrhea model most closely mimics the partial response to NTZ treatment reported to occur in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} long term, low dose azithromycin treatment for <b>chronic</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> in patients with AIDS. METHODS: Azithromycin was administered as initial daily treatment to 13 patients with AIDS: 6 patients received 500 mg for 30 to 40 days (mean 35); 3 patients received 1000 mg for 21 to 50 days (mean 37); and 4 patients received 1500 mg for 20 days. Nine of the 13 patients were also given low dose maintenance treatment with different schedules of azithromycin for 30 to 360 days (mean 129). Patients were monitored, during and after treatment, for parasite shedding in stool and for daily stool frequency and body weight. All but one patient had severe immunodeficiency. RESULTS: Long term, low dose maintenance treatment was associated with major clinical and parasitological benefits: there was probable eradication of infection in 2 patients, and 7 patients showed a complete response with persistent high decrease (5 patients) or clearance (2 patients) of parasite in stool. The drug was well tolerated, {{and there was no}} relapse either during treatment or during follow up (up to 21 months). These results were more impressive than those observed after the short term initial course of azithromycin, which was unable at any tested dose to achieve parasite clearance in stool (except in the patient with less advanced immunodeficiency) or to prevent relapse in 3 patients who discontinued treatment. Reversible side effects occurred with the 1500 mg daily dose. CONCLUSIONS: Long term, low dose azithromycin is well tolerated and may induce stable remission of <b>chronic</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> in patients with AIDS. It may lead to probable eradication of the infection in some patients, even those with severe immunodeficiency...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} benzindazole- 4, 9 -quinones was tested for growth-inhibitory effects on Crypto-sporidium parvum in vitro and in vivo.

40|$|Cryptosporidium sp. causes fulminant {{diarrhea}} and chronic infection in immunocompromised, particularly human immunodeficiency virus-infected, persons. The lack of in vitro cultivation and a suitable animal model has limited development of effective treatment. We describe two new mouse models of chronic symptomatic cryptosporidiosis in adult athymic mice and in T-cell subset-depleted mice. A progressive infection, fatal within 4 months, occurred in most adult athymic mice; a few developed stable infections. Symptoms included dehydration, weight loss, intermittent diarrhea, and jaundice. Pathologic abnormalities and organisms localized in the intestine in stable infections but involved the hepatobiliary tree and pancreas in others. Lymphoid cells from histocompatible, Cryptosporidium sp. -immune mice cured infected nude mice. Identical infections occurred in neonatally infected BALB/c mice treated with anti-CD 4 monoclonal antibodies alone or also with anti-CD 8 monoclonal antibodies; the mice were cured when the monoclonal antibody treatments were stopped. These models {{will be useful}} in definition of the immune defects that permit <b>chronic</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> to develop and in assessment of treatment modalities...|$|E
40|$|Dietary L-arginine (4 %) {{significantly}} reduced fecal oocyst shedding in athymic nude mice chronically infected with Cryptosporidium parvum. This effect {{appeared to be}} due to an increase in host nitric oxide (NO) production as it was not observed in arginine-supplemented animals administered the NO synthase inhibitor, N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. N-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester alone significantly increased fecal oocyst shedding in chronically infected animals. In in vitro assays, oocyst excystation and sporozoite viability were {{significantly reduced}} by the NO donors sodium nitroprusside and S-nitroso-L-acetyl penicillamine in a concentration-dependent manner. These data suggest that arginine-derived NO may reduce the parasite load in experimental cryptosporidiosis. Cryptosporidium parvum is an intracellular protozoan para-site that establishes itself in a parasitophorous vacuole just within the brush border of host small intestinal enterocytes (6). The infection is self limiting, except in immunodeficient hosts, in which it may cause protracted and untreatable diarrhea. As a result, <b>chronic</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> is responsible for consider-able morbidity and some mortality in AIDS patients (16) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of the immunomodulator dehydroepiandrosterone in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in glucocorticoid-induced immunosuppressed rats. A significant reduction in cryptosporidial activity occurred in treated versus untreated rats as assessed by oocyst shedding intensities and examination of parasite colonization in the small intestine. Cryptosporidiosis, caused by the coccidian parasite Cryp-tosporidium parvum, is manifested as a mild to severe choleralike diarrhea in animals and humans (15). The disease is more severe in neonates and immunocompromised hosts than in normal adults (6). Patients undergoing immunosup-pressive therapy who contract <b>chronic</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> have been cleared of the infection by temporary removal of the immunosuppressive therapy (14). These findings suggest that immunomodulation may be of value in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in immunodeficient patients. The lack of effective anticryptosporidial chemotherapeutic agents (8) prompted the present investigation to test the effectiveness of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a steroid hormone produced naturally by the adrenal cortex (5), in controlling cryptosporidiosis in immunosuppressed rats. In rodents, administration of exogenous DHEA up-regulates immune systems (3, 10, 13). Currently, DHEA is one of numerous immunomodulators undergoing clinical evaluation as a potential treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection (7) ...|$|E
40|$|Cryptosporidium {{species are}} apicomplexan protozoans {{that are found}} worldwide. These parasites {{constitute}} a large risk to human and animal health. They cause self-limited diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts and a life-threatening disease in immunocompromised hosts. Interestingly, Cryptosporidium parvum has been related to digestive carcinogenesis in humans. Consistent with a potential tumorigenic role of this parasite, in an original reproducible animal model of <b>chronic</b> <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> based on dexamethasone-treated or untreated adult SCID mice, we formerly reported that C. parvum (strains of animal and human origin) is able to induce digestive adenocarcinoma even in infections induced with very low inoculum. The {{aim of this study}} was to further characterize this animal model and to explore metabolic pathways potentially involved in the development of C. parvum-induced ileo-caecal oncogenesis. We searched for alterations in genes or proteins commonly involved in cell cycle, differentiation or cell migration, such as β-catenin, Apc, E-cadherin, Kras and p 53. After infection of animals with C. parvum we demonstrated immunohistochemical abnormal localization of Wnt signaling pathway components and p 53. Mutations in the selected loci of studied genes were not found after high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, alterations in the ultrastructure of adherens junctions of the ileo-caecal neoplastic epithelia of C. parvum-infected mice were recorded using transmission electron microscopy. In conclusion, we found for the first time that the Wnt signaling pathway, and particularly the cytoskeleton network, seems to be pivotal for the development of the C. parvum-induced neoplastic process and cell migration of transformed cells. Furthermore, this model is a valuable tool in understanding the host-pathogen interactions associated with the intricate infection process of this parasite, which is able to modulate host cytoskeleton activities and several host-cell biological processes and remains a significant cause of infection worldwide...|$|E
