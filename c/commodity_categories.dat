40|$|Planned {{shopping}} malls usually {{have one or}} more department stores (anchor stores) and multiple specialized retail stores in each <b>commodity</b> <b>category.</b> This paper presents a model of {{shopping malls}} in which {{these two types of}} stores sell noncomplementary commodities. If anchor stores sell standard (riskless yet low-value) commodities and retail stores sell specialized (high variance yet high expected value) commodities, then each type of store may benefit from collocating with the other, even though the stores sell substitutable products. The underlying intuition is that the presence of each type of retailer enhances consumer traffic at the shopping mall, which benefits the retailer or retailers of the other type. Under some parametric restrictions, the value of this increased traffic more than offsets the loss in markups due to competition from additional sellers at the mall. In this case, it is in a land developer's interest to rent retail space in the mall to both types of retailers.

Consumer heterogeneity makes value created by traditional retail for customers including price, category diversity, service, experience and entertainment. Among them, price and category diversity are the advantages of online purchase; however, service, experience and entertainment are the advantages of existing physical stores. This study also concludes that traditional retail enterprises’ innovation should create value for consumers based on new business models. For example, the advantage of department stores {{is that they have}} offline stores, {{and most of them are}} in the commercial center and core business district of a community. The way to enhance the customers’ satisfaction will also help to increase customers’ loyalty. “Small and beautiful” means to optimize the adjustment of the department store category, through the selection of <b>commodity</b> <b>categories,</b> selection of brands, and the positioning of high-end fashion experience shopping.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{economic}} {{market approach}} to urban system modelling is described, where all interactions are characterized as exchanges in a market. This {{leads to a}} natural partition of an integrated urban model into submodels based on the category of good or service being supplied or demanded, the type of agent making the demand or supply, and {{the time and place}} of interaction. Actors communicate through 6 defined operations on markets, decoupling the algorithms representing different behaviour. Agent based approaches to simulation are a natural extension of the market approach, allowing a transaction based simulation of heterogeneous spatial markets with individual agents making specific offers in specific places at specific times, and other agents accepting those offers at future specific times. Incorporating many existing modelling methods into such a framework requires a set of average prices by segmenting markets by <b>commodity</b> <b>category,</b> space and time, and wrapping the modules in interfaces that recast the inputs and ouputs into market operations. The paradigm is applied to two existing modelling frameworks: the Sacramento MEPLAN model and the Oregon statewide TLUMIP model...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{report on}} an {{exercise}} in economic statistics. They develop a regional price index for Cote d'Ivoire building on the strengths of two independent data sources: the Cote d'Ivoire Living Standards Survey (CILSS) and the International Comparisons Project (ICP). The CILSS collected detailed information on household incomes, spending, employment, and so on, but its coverage of prices left much to be desired. The ICP collected {{a wealth of information}} on prices across the country, but collected no information on household spending patterns or other socioeconomic data. The authors bring together these two sources to produce a regional price index that they argue is superior to previous estimates based solely on the Living Standards Survey. The procedures they follow should be of interest to practitioners faced with similar data shortcomings, particularly when working on Africa. They show this to be no mere statistical exercise.

The findings support the view that Indonesia's poor export performance in the post-crisis era is largely supply driven. They strengthen the case for reversal of recent backsliding in macroeconomic policy reform, and for speedy implementation of the unfinished reform agenda. Prudent macroeconomic management, while necessary, is not sufficient to achieve rapid and sustained export growth in an era of rapid economic globalisation. ...|$|E

A distinction is made between export earnings in convertible and nonconvertible currency, {{as well as between}} four major <b>commodity</b> <b>categories.</b> The focus of the analysis is on the likely consequences of greater regional economic autonomy within Russia. It is found that only very few areas would clearly benefit from enhanced regional control over export earnings, mainly by obtaining a higher share of resource rents. Furthermore, in the present environment of distorted prices and balance of payments constraints, decentralization could lead to substantial windfall gains for established exporters at the expense of areas that happen to supply mainly the domestic market. The speedy introduction of a price structure reflecting genuine scarcities would therefore help not only to eliminate allocative inefficiency, but also to minimize interregional distributional conflicts. ...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the global}} {{capitalist}} crisis, neoliberalism and the logic of commodification of everything have suffered cracks, fissures and holes. There is a return of the interest in Marx, which requires us {{to think about the}} role of Marxism in Media and Communication Studies.

Dallas Smythe reminds us of the importance of engagement with Marx’s works for studying the media in capitalism critically. Both Critical Theory and Critical Political Economy of the Media and Communication have been criticized for being one-sided. Such interpretations are mainly based on selective readings. They ignore that in both approaches there has been with different weightings a focus on aspects of media commodification, audiences, ideology and alternatives. Critical Theory and Critical Political Economy are complementary and should be combined in Critical Media and Communication Studies today.

We use 10 old EU countries' analogous trade data and trends as a basis of comparison. Besides the (spectacular) growth of IIT, we also examine the trends of strong and not really favourable sectoral concentration of IIT. At the same time, the beakdown of IIT by price-quality segments (i. e., horizontal, low-quality and high-quality vertical IIT) shows a very positive picture, hinting to a very important technological and quality upgrading in the manufacturing industry of CEECs. However, such a conclusion is open to doubts because IIT does not include only the exchange of otherwise similar products of equal or different quality but also back-and-forth transactions in vertically fragmented production chains in the same <b>commodity</b> <b>category.</b> Thus, revealing the actual nature of the contribution {{to the production of}} items exported in the framework of IIT requires further research.

40|$|The paper prepares new {{estimates}} for the elasticity of US trade flows using bilateral, commodity-detailed trade data for 31 countries, using measures of expenditure and trade prices matched to commodity groups, and including a commodity-andcountry specific proxy for global supply-cum-variety. Using the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade) we construct bilateral trade flows for 31 countries in four categories of goods based on the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s “end-use ” classification system—autos, industrial supplies and materials–excluding energy, consumer goods, and capital goods. We find that using expenditure matched to <b>commodity</b> <b>category</b> yields more plausible values for the demand elasticities than does using GDP as the measure of demand that drives trade flows. Controlling for country and commodity fixed effects, we find that industrial and developing countries have demand elasticities that are statistically significant and that generally differ between development groups and across product categories. Relative prices for the industrial countries have plausible parameter values, are statistically significant and differ across product groups, but the relative prices for developing countries are poorly estimated. We find that variety is an important variable for the behavior of capital goods trade. Because the commodity composition of trade and of trading partners has changed dramatically, particularly for imports, {{we find that the}} demand elasticity for imports is not constant.

40|$|Historically, the {{integration}} of international markets has corresponded with decreasing prices for traded goods due to higher competition among suppliers, scale economies, and consumption demand. In recent years, product differentiation and multinational firm pricing behavior across markets and between suppliers {{make it difficult to}} assess the degree to which this still occurs. Using a confidential panel dataset comprising the universe of U. S. import trade transactions between 1992 and 2007, this paper explores the change in prices for imported commodities across American trade partners. Overall price dispersion appears to decline, albeit unevenly, over time; nevertheless, there is considerable heterogeneity within commodity groups, geographic regions, and income levels, which may owe to increased product and quality differentiation within <b>commodity</b> <b>categories.</b> Unusually, after controlling for gravity trade factors, trade openness and extensive measures of globalization are positively associated with price dispersion, which suggests a more disaggregated approach both at the commodity and firm level to account for these differences. price convergence, offshoring, product differentiation, multinational firm, law of one price...|$|E

The Air Force currently spends about one-third of its annual budget on purchased goods and services. This offers the Air Force a large target in which to seek cost savings. Commercial firms have moved toward a commodity-council approach for purchasing in recent years, and the cost reductions realized have been impressive. Findings have shown that the increased leverage from commodity councils will optimize buying power for the Air Force, reduce duplication of effort, improve customer support, and minimize supply-chain costs through integration and collaboration. ?Commodity Council? is a term used to describe a cross-functional sourcing team designed to create a centralized purchasing strategy and establish centralized contracts for enterprise-wide requirements. The commodity council drives commonality and standardization and ensures the leveraging of purchasing volume.

For consumer items, the district expenditure elasticities were estimated to be 0, 76 and 0, 71, while expenditure on social obligations would not increase with rural incomes. Wealthier households (the top expenditure decile) have a greater propensity for increased expenditure on transport, while poorer households show a greater propensity for increased expenditure on housing and durables.
