40|$|Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) {{was used}} to map the {{internal}} airflow of a domestic kitchen oven. Oven cooking performance is dependant on the airflow within the cavity. Previous flow measurement techniques such as hot wire anemometry and pitot probes are very time consuming and prone to error in the hot recirculating flow in an oven. The oven cavity, a commercially available mid-range oven, was modified for optical access. The PIV system consisted of a CCD camera, light sheet illumination from a pulsed Nd:YAG laser, and propanediol droplets and hollow glass spheres with a Stokes number of less than 0. 055. Experiments were conducted in an empty oven at room temperature and at 180 oC, and at 180 oC with a single <b>cooking</b> <b>tray</b> installed. Velocity fields were measured in seven adjacent, coplanar object planes each on four different planes in the oven. The velocity data was averaged to yield mean flow fields, and the seven coplanar data fields were subsequently collaged to produce a full cross-sectional velocity map for each oven plane. In the cold and hot empty cavity a single vortex centred on the fan axis was seen, with strong radial flow. The maximum measured velocity in the cold oven was 1. 8 ms- 1, which compared well with earlier hot-wire measurements. When a tray was introduced, the single vortex was replaced by three circulatory features. Shear flow was seen on both upper and lower sides of the tray, with a lower velocity and a stagnation point on the upper side...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} certify the {{performance}} of a box-type solar cooker, thermal performance is evaluated in terms of two figures of merit viz. F 1 and F 2 (IS 13429 : 2000). The acceptable criterion to make the solar cooker eligible for ISI mark is that the value of F 1 should not be less than 0. 12, and that of F 2 should be greater than 0. 40. Further, the solar cooker is classified as Grade A if the value of F 1 is determined to be 0. 12 or higher; otherwise, the solar cooker is classified as Grade B. Determination of F 1 and F 2 comprises measurements of the temperature of <b>cooking</b> <b>tray,</b> water temperature and ambient air, solar irradiance, and other associated parameters. The effect of accuracy obtained in these measurements assumes significance in the perspective of grading of solar cookers. In the present work, an attempt has been made to analyze the effect of instrumentation on F 1 and F 2, which is normally employed for testing and standardization of solar cookers. The analysis is supported by a large number of outdoor tests conducted on a box type solar cooker under stagnation as well as load test conditions. It is observed that the variation of absolute value of error in F 1 and F 2 could be in the range of 0. 002 - 0. 003 and 0. 015 - 0. 033, respectively. This corresponds to errors of the order of 2. 5 - 3. 0 % in the evaluation of F 1 and 5. 0 - 6. 0 % in F 2...|$|E
5000|$|Until {{the late}} 20th century, the Saramaka {{produced}} {{most of their}} material culture, much of it embellished with decorative detail. Women sewed patchwork and embroidered clothing, and carved calabash bowls. Some men also produced baskets, and some women made pottery. Men built the houses and canoes. In addition, they carved {{a wide range of}} wooden objects for domestic use, such as stools, paddles, winnowing <b>trays,</b> <b>cooking</b> utensils, and combs. Today, an increasing number of items, including clothing, are imported from the coast.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to European contact, {{the people}} wore little clothing. The men were naked year-round {{and the women}} and girls may have worn a small apron. In cold weather they may have covered {{themselves}} with mud or rabbit or deerskin capes. No evidence of sandals or foot wear have been found. Evidence of baskets have been found and were probably the principle item used to furnish households. Basket design included large conical baskets for carrying burdens, hemispherical-shaped <b>cooking</b> bowls, flat <b>trays,</b> and small boat-shaped baskets {{which may have been}} seed-beaters.
