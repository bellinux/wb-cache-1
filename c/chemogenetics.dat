Although <b>Chemogenetics</b> offers specificity and high spatial resolution, it still faces some challenges when used in investigating neuropsychiatric disorders. Neuropsychiatric disorders usually have a complex nature where lesions in the brain have not been identified as the main cause. <b>Chemogenetics</b> has been used to reverse some of the deficits revolving such conditions however, it hasn’t been able to identify the main cause of neuropsychiatric diseases and cure these conditions completely due to complex nature of these conditions.|$|E
5000|$|In recent {{research}} projects, <b>chemogenetics</b> {{has been widely}} used to {{understand the relationship between}} brain activity and behavior. Prior to <b>chemogenetics,</b> researchers used methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and deep brain stimulation(DBS) to study the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chemogenetics</b> has {{recently}} been favored over Optogenetics, and it avoids some of the challenges of Optogenetics. <b>Chemogenetics</b> {{does not require the}} expensive light equipment, and therefore, is more accessible. The resolution in Optogenetic declines due to light scattering and illuminance declined levels as the distance between the subject and the light source increases.These factors, therefore, don’t allow for all cells to be affected by light and lead to a lower spatial resolution. <b>Chemogenetics,</b> however, does not require light usage and therefore can achieve a higher spatial resolution.|$|E

5000|$|The term <b>chemogenetics</b> {{has been}} used to {{describe}} the processes by which macromolecules can be engineered to interact with previously unrecognized small molecules. <b>Chemogenetics</b> as a term was originally coined to describe the observed effects of mutations on chalcone isomerase activity on substrate specificities in the flowers of Dianthus caryophyllus. This Method is very similar to Optogenetics however, it uses chemically engineered molecules and ligands instead of light and light-sensitive channels known as Opsins.|$|E
50|$|Optogenetics and <b>Chemogenetics</b> are {{the more}} recent and popular methods used to study this relationship. Both of these methods target {{specific}} brain circuits and cell population to influence cell activity. However, they use different procedures to accomplish this task. Optogenetics uses light-sensitive channels and pumps that are virally introduced into neurons. Cells' activity, having these channels, can then be manipulated by light. <b>Chemogenetics,</b> on the other hand, uses chemically engineered receptors and exogenous molecules specific for those receptors, to affect the activity of those cells. The engineered macromolecules used to design these receptors include nucleic acid hybrids, kinases , variety of metabolic enzymes, and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DREADDs.|$|E
5000|$|DREADDs are {{the most}} common GPCRs used in <b>chemogenetics.</b> These receptors solely get {{activated}} by the drug of interest (inert molecule) and influence physiological and neural processes that take place within and outside of the central nervous system.|$|E
50|$|GPCRs' {{usage and}} <b>chemogenetics</b> are {{nowadays}} the targets {{for many of}} the pharmaceutical companies to cure and alleviate symptoms of diseases that involve all tissues of the body. More specifically, DREADDs have been used to explore treatment options for various neurodegenerative and psychological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, depression, anxiety, and addiction. These aforementioned conditions involve processes that occur within and outside of the nervous system involving neurotransmitters such as GABA and Glutamate. <b>Chemogenetics</b> has therefore been used in pharmacology to adjust the levels of such neurotransmitters in specific neuron while minimizing the side effects of treatment. To treat and relieve the symptoms of any disease using the DREADDs, these receptors are delivered to the area of interest via viral transduction.|$|E
50|$|The {{progression}} of <b>Chemogenetics</b> from rodents to non-human primates {{has been slow}} due to increased demand in time and expense surrounding these projects.However, some recent studies in 2016 {{have been able to}} demonstrate successes showing that silencing the activity of neurons in the Orbitofrontal cortex along with the removal of Rhinal cortex, restricted the reward task performance in macaques.|$|E
50|$|Another {{study used}} optogenetics and <b>chemogenetics</b> to control {{neuronal}} activity in animals encoding and recalling {{the memory of}} a spatial context to investigate how the brain determines the lifetime of memories. The results found by the researchers have defined a role for specific hippocampal inhibitory cells (somatostatin expressing cells) in restricting the number of neurons involved in the storage of spatial information and limiting the duration of the associated memory.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{gene therapy}} in {{treating}} neurological {{disorders such as}} epilepsy has presented itself as an increasingly viable area of ongoing research with the primary targets being somatostatin, galanin, neuropeptide y, potassium channels, optogenetics and <b>chemogenetics</b> for epilepsy. As the field of gene therapy continues to grow and show promising results {{for the treatment of}} epilepsy among other diseases, additional research {{needs to be done in}} ensuring patient safety, developing alternative methods for DNA delivery, and finding feasible methods for scaling up delivery volumes.|$|E
50|$|In {{finding a}} method for {{treating}} epilepsy, the pathophysiology of epilepsy is considered. As the seizures that characterize epilepsy typically result from excessive and synchronous discharges of excitatory neurons, the logical goal for gene therapy treatment is to reduce excitation or enhance inhibition. Out of the viral approaches, neuropeptide transgenes being researched are somatostatin, galanin, and neuropeptide Y (NPY). However, adenosine and gamma-aminobutryic acid (GABA) and GABA receptors are gaining more momentum as well. Other transgenes being studied are potassium channels and tools for on-demand suppression of excitability (optogenetics and <b>chemogenetics).</b>|$|E
5000|$|DREADDS {{have been}} used in many animal models (e.g., mice and other non-primate animals) to target and {{influence}} the activity of various cells [...] <b>Chemogenetics</b> used in animals assists with demonstrating human disease models such as Parkinson's disease. Having this information allows scientists understand whether viral expression of DREADD proteins, both in-vivo enhancers and inhibitors of neuronal function can be used to bidirectionally affect the behaviors and the activity of the involved neurons. Recent studies have shown that DREADDs were successfully used to treat the motor deficits of rats modeling Parkinson's disease. Other studies have had successes linking the usage of DREADDs and influencing drug seeking and drug sensitization behavior.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} approach for on-demand control of circuit excitability that does nor require light delivery {{to the brain}} is to use <b>chemogenetics.</b> This relies on expressing a mutated receptor in the seizure focus, which does not respond to endogenous neurotransmitters but can be activated by an exogenous drug. G-protein coupled receptors mutated in this way are called Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). Success in treating epilepsy has been reported using the inhibitory DREADD hM4D(Gi), which {{is derived from the}} M4 muscarinic receptor. AAV-mediated expression of hM4D(Gi) in a rodent model of focal epilepsy on its own had no effect, but when activated by the drug clozapine-N-oxide it suppressed seizures. The treatment had no detectable side effects and is, in principle, suited for clinical translation.|$|E
40|$|A central goal in {{understanding}} brain {{function is to}} link specific cell populations to behavioral outputs. In recent years, the selective targeting of specific neural circuits has been made possible {{with the development of}} new experimental approaches, including <b>chemogenetics.</b> This technique allows for the control of molecularly-defined subsets of cells through engineered G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which have the ability to activate or silence neuronal firing. Through <b>chemogenetics,</b> neural circuits are being linked to behavioral outputs at an unprecedented rate. Further, the coupling of <b>chemogenetics</b> with imaging techniques to monitor neural activity in freely-moving animals now makes it possible to deconstruct the complex whole-brain networks that are fundamental to behavioral states. In this review, we highlight a specific chemogenetic application known as DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs). DREADDs are used ubiquitously to modulate GPCR activity in vivo and have been widely applied in the basic sciences, particularly in the field of behavioral neuroscience. Here, we focus on the impact and utility of DREADD technology in dissecting the neural circuitry of various behaviors including memory, cognition, reward, feeding, anxiety and pain. By using DREADDs to monitor the electrophysiological, biochemical, and behavioral outputs of specific neuronal types, researchers can better understand the links between brain activity and behavior. Additionally, DREADDs are useful in studying the pathogenesis of disease and may ultimately have therapeutic potential...|$|E

Understanding how antagonism of NMDARs alters synapse and circuit function is pivotal to developing circuit-based therapies for depression. Using virally induced gene deletion, ex vivo optogenetic-assisted circuit analysis, and in vivo <b>chemogenetics</b> and fMRI, we assessed the role of NMDARs in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in controlling depression-related behavior in mice. We demonstrate that post-developmental genetic deletion of the NMDAR subunit GluN 2 B from pyramidal neurons in the mPFC enhances connectivity between the mPFC and limbic thalamus, but not the ventral hippocampus, and reduces depression-like behavior. Using intersectional <b>chemogenetics,</b> we show that activation of this thalamocortical circuit is sufficient to elicit a decrease in despair-like behavior. Our findings reveal that GluN 2 B exerts input-specific control of pyramidal neuron innervation and identify a medial dorsal thalamus (MDT) →mPFC circuit that controls depression-like behavior...|$|E
40|$|Serotonin-producing neurons profusely {{innervate}} {{brain regions}} via long-range projections. However, {{it remains unclear}} whether and how endogenous serotonergic transmission specifically influences regional or global functional activity. We combined designed receptors exclusively activated by designed drugs (DREADD) -based <b>chemogenetics</b> and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), an approach we term â 8 ̆ 09 ̆cchemo-fMRI,â 8 ̆ 09 ̆d to causally probe the brain-wide substrates modulated by endogenous serotonergic activity. We describe the generation of a conditional knockin mouse line that, crossed with serotonin-specific Cre-recombinase mice, allowed us to remotely stimulate serotonergic neurons during fMRI scans. We show that endogenous stimulation of serotonin-producing neurons does not affect global brain activity but results in region-specific activation of a set of primary target regions encompassing corticohippocampal and ventrostriatal areas. By contrast, pharmacological boosting of serotonin levels produced widespread fMRI deactivation, plausibly reflecting the mixed contribution of central and perivascular constrictive effects. Our results identify the primary functional targets of endogenous serotonergic stimulation and establish causation between activation of serotonergic neurons and regional fMRI signals. Giorgi et al. combined <b>chemogenetics</b> and functional magnetic resonance imaging (chemo-fMRI) to establish causation between serotonin release and regional functional activity. They show that endogenous serotonergic transmission does not affect global brain activity but selectively activates a set of target regions that serve as primary effectors of this modulatory system...|$|E
40|$|The central {{mechanism}} by which neurotensin (Nts) potentiates weight loss has remained elusive. We leveraged <b>chemogenetics</b> to reveal that Nts-expressing neurons of the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) promote weight loss in mice by increasing volitional activity and restraining food intake. Intriguingly, these dual weight loss behaviors are mediated by distinct signaling pathways: Nts action via NtsR 1 {{is essential for the}} anorectic effect of the LHA Nts circuit, but not for regulation of locomotor or drinking behavior. Furthermore, although LHA Nts neurons cannot reduce intake of freely available obesogenic foods, they effectively restrain motivated feeding in hungry, weight-restricted animals. LHA Nts neurons are thus vital mediators of central Nts action, particularly in the face of negative energy balance. Enhanced action via LHA Nts neurons may, therefore, be useful to suppress the increased appetitive drive that occurs after lifestyle-mediated weight loss and, hence, to prevent weight regain...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{locus coeruleus}} noradrenergic (LC-NE) system {{is one of}} the first systems engaged {{following}} a stressful event. While numerous groups have demonstrated that LC-NE neurons are activated by many different stressors, the underlying neural circuitry and the role of this activity in generating stress-induced anxiety has not been elucidated. Using a combination of in vivo <b>chemogenetics,</b> optogenetics, and retrograde tracing, we determine that increased tonic activity of the LC-NE system is necessary and sufficient for stress-induced anxiety and aversion. Selective inhibition of LC-NE neurons during stress prevents subsequent anxiety-like behavior. Exogenously increasing tonic, but not phasic, activity of LC-NE neurons is alone sufficient for anxiety-like and aversive behavior. Furthermore, endogenous corticotropin-releasing hormone+ (CRH+) LC inputs from the amygdala increase tonic LC activity, inducing anxiety-like behaviors. These studies position the LC-NE system as a critical mediator of acute stress-induced anxiety and offer a potential intervention for preventing stress-related affective disorders...|$|E
40|$|SummaryDeveloping granule cells (GCs) of {{the adult}} dentate gyrus undergo a {{critical}} period of enhanced activity and synaptic plasticity before becoming mature. The impact of developing GCs on the activity of preexisting dentate circuits remains unknown. Here we combine optogenetics, acute slice electrophysiology, and in vivo <b>chemogenetics</b> to activate GCs {{at different stages of}} maturation to study the recruitment of local target networks. We show that immature (4 -week-old) GCs can efficiently drive distal CA 3 targets but poorly activate proximal interneurons responsible for feedback inhibition (FBI). As new GCs transition toward maturity, they reliably recruit GABAergic feedback loops that restrict spiking of neighbor GCs, a mechanism that would promote sparse coding. Such inhibitory loop impinges only weakly in new cohorts of young GCs. A computational model reveals that the delayed coupling of new GCs to FBI could be crucial to achieve a fine-grain representation of novel inputs in the dentate gyrus...|$|E
40|$|The {{cerebellar}} system helps modulate and fine-tune motor action. Purkinje cells (PCs) {{provide the}} sole {{output of the}} cerebellar cortex, therefore, any cerebellar involvement in motor activity must be driven by changes in PC firing rates. Several different cell types influence PC activity including excitatory input from parallel fibers and inhibition from molecular layer interneurons (MLIs). Similar to PCs, MLI activity is driven by parallel fibers, therefore, MLIs provide feed-forward inhibition onto PCs. To aid in the experimental assessment of how molecular layer inhibition contributes to cerebellar function and motor behavior, we characterized a new knock-in mouse line with Cre recombinase expression under control of endogenous c-kit transcriptional machinery. Using these engineered c-Kit mice, {{we were able to}} obtain high levels of conditional MLI transduction in adult mice using Cre-dependent viral vectors without any PC or granule cell labeling. We then used the mouse line to target MLIs for activity perturbation in vitro using opto- and <b>chemogenetics...</b>|$|E
40|$|The gene transfer-mediated {{expression}} of inhibitory ion channels in nociceptive neurons holds promise for treating intractable pain. <b>Chemogenetics,</b> which involves expressing constructs activated by biologically inert molecules, {{is of particular}} interest as it permits tunable neuromodulation. However, current chloride-permeable chemogenetic constructs are problematic as they mediate a tonic chloride influx which over time would deplete the chloride electrochemical gradient and reduce inhibitory efficacy. Inflammatory pain sensitization can be caused by prostaglandin E 2 -mediated inhibition of glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents in spinal nociceptive neurons. We developed a highly conducting (100 pS) inhibitory chemogenetic construct based on a human glycine receptor (α 1) with high ivermectin sensitivity. When virally infected into spinal neurons, 10 nM ivermectin increased the magnitude and frequency of glycinergic postsynaptic currents without activating a tonic chloride flux. The construct should thus produce analgesia. Its human origin and the well-established biocompatibility of its ligand suggest it may be suited to human use...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Over {{the past}} decade, two {{independent}} technologies have emerged and been widely {{adopted by the}} neuroscience community for remotely controlling neuronal activity: optogenetics which utilize engineered channelrho-dopsin and other opsins, and <b>chemogenetics</b> which utilize engineered G protein-coupled receptors (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs)) and other orthologous ligand−receptor pairs. Using directed molecular evolution, two types of DREADDs derived from human muscarinic acetylcholine receptors have been developed: hM 3 Dq which activates neuronal firing, and hM 4 Di which inhibits neuronal firing. Importantly, these DREADDs were not activated by the native ligand acetylcholine (ACh), but selectively activated by clozapine N-oxide (CNO), a pharmacologically inert ligand. CNO has been used extensively in rodent models to activate DREADDs, and although CNO {{is not subject to}} significant metabolic transformation in mice, a small fraction of CNO is apparently metabolized to clozapine in humans and guinea pigs, lessening the translational potential of DREADDs. To effectively translate the DREADD technology, the next generation of DREADD agonists are needed and a thorough understanding of structure−activity relationships (SARs) of DREADDs is required for developin...|$|E
40|$|Sensory {{information}} processing {{is a fundamental}} operation in the brain {{that is based on}} dynamic interactions between different neuronal populations. Astrocytes, a type of glial cells, have been proposed to represent active elements of brain microcircuits that, through dynamic interactions with neurons, provide a modulatory control of neuronal network activity. Specifically, astrocytes in different brain regions have been described to respond to neuronal signals with intracellular Ca 2 + elevations that represent a key step in the functional recruitment of astrocytes to specific brain circuits. Accumulating evidence shows that Ca 2 + elevations regulate the release of gliotransmitters that, in turn, modulate synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. Recent studies also provided new insights into the spatial and temporal features of astrocytic Ca 2 + elevations revealing a surprising complexity of Ca 2 + signal dynamics in astrocytes. Here we discuss how recently developed experimental tools such as the genetically encoded Ca 2 + indicators (GECI), optogenetics and <b>chemogenetics</b> {{can be applied to the}} study of astrocytic Ca 2 + signals in the living brain...|$|E
40|$|Muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors (mAChRs) {{have been}} found to regulate many diverse functions, ranging from motivation and feeding to spatial navigation, an important and widely studied type of cognitive behavior. Systemic administration of non-selective antagonists of mAChRs, such as scopolamine or atropine, {{have been found}} to have adverse effects on a vast majority of place navigation tasks. However, many of these results may be potentially confounded by disruptions of functions other than spatial learning and memory. Although studies with selective antimuscarinics point to mutually opposite effects of M 1 and M 2 receptors, their particular contribution to spatial cognition is still poorly understood, partly {{due to a lack of}} truly selective agents. Furthermore, constitutive knock-outs do not always support results from selective antagonists. For modeling impaired spatial cognition, the scopolamine-induced amnesia model still maintains some limited validity, but there is an apparent need for more targeted approaches such as local intracerebral administration of antagonists, as well as novel techniques such as optogenetics focused on cholinergic neurons and <b>chemogenetics</b> aimed at cells expressing metabotropic mAChRs...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{nucleic acid}} base pairing and stacking via atom-specific mutagenesis and crystallography, we have synthesized {{for the first}} time the 6 -Se-deoxyguanosine phosphoramidite and incorporated it into DNAs via solid-phase synthesis with a coupling yield over 97 %. We found that the UV absorption of the Se-DNAs red-shifts over 100 nm to 360 nm (ε = 2. 3 × 104 M− 1 cm− 1), the Se-DNAs are yellow colored, and this Se modification is relatively stable in water and at elevated temperature. Moreover, we successfully crystallized a ternary complex of the Se-G-DNA, RNA and RNase H. The crystal structure determination and analysis reveal that the overall structures of the native and Se-modified nucleic acid duplexes are very similar, the selenium atom participates in a Se-mediated hydrogen bond (Se … H–N), and the SeG and C form a base pair similar to the natural G–C pair though the Se-modification causes the base-pair to shift (approximately 0. 3 Å). Our biophysical and structural studies provide new insights into the nucleic acid flexibility, duplex recognition and stability. Furthermore, this novel selenium modification of nucleic acids can be used to investigate <b>chemogenetics</b> and structure of nucleic acids and their protein complexes...|$|E

This fundamental {{aspect of the}} sickness response reduces {{the quality of life}} for people suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases and is a nuisance during mild infections like common colds or the flu. To investigate how inflammation is perceived as unpleasant and causes negative affect, we used a behavioral test in which mice avoid an environment that they have learned to associate with inflammation-induced discomfort. Using a combination of cell-type–specific gene deletions, pharmacology, and <b>chemogenetics,</b> we found that systemic inflammation triggered aversion through MyD 88 -dependent activation of the brain endothelium followed by COX 1 -mediated cerebral prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) synthesis. Further, we showed that inflammation-induced PGE 2 targeted EP 1 receptors on striatal dopamine D 1 receptor–expressing neurons and that this signaling sequence induced aversion through GABA-mediated inhibition of dopaminergic cells. Finally, we demonstrated that inflammation-induced aversion was not an indirect consequence of fever or anorexia but that it constituted an independent inflammatory symptom triggered by a unique molecular mechanism. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PGE 2 -mediated modulation of the dopaminergic motivational circuitry is a key mechanism underlying the negative affect induced by inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Rapid eye {{movement}} (REM) sleep behavior disorder in humans is {{often accompanied by}} a reduced ability to smell and detect odors, and olfactory bulbectomized rats exhibit increased REM sleep, suggesting that the olfactory bulb (OB) is involved in REM-sleep regulation. However, the molecular mechanism of REM-sleep regulation by the OB is unknown. Adenosine promotes sleep and its A 2 A receptors (A 2 AR) are expressed in the OB. We hypothesized that A 2 AR in the OB regulate REM sleep. Bilateral microinjections of the A 2 AR antagonist SCH 58261 into the rat OB increased REM sleep, whereas microinjections of the A 2 AR agonist CGS 21680 decreased REM sleep. Similar to the A 2 AR antagonist, selective A 2 AR knockdown by adeno-associated virus carrying short-hairpin RNA for A 2 AR in the rat OB increased REM sleep. Using <b>chemogenetics</b> {{on the basis of}} designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs, we demonstrated that the inhibition of A 2 AR neurons increased REM sleep, whereas the activation of these neurons decreased REM sleep. Moreover, using a conditional anterograde axonal tract-tracing approach, we found that OB A 2 AR neurons innervate the piriform cortex and olfactory tubercle. These novel findings indicate that adenosine suppresses REM sleep via A 2 AR in the OB of rodents. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Linking {{neural circuit}} {{activation}} at whole-brain level to neuronal activity at cellular level {{remains one of}} the major challenges in neuroscience research. We set up a novel functional neuroimaging approach to map global effects of locally induced activation of specific midbrain projection neurons using <b>chemogenetics</b> (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) -technology) combined with pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) in the rat mesocorticolimbic system. Chemogenetic activation of DREADD-targeted mesolimbic or mesocortical pathways, i. e. projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) or medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), respectively, induced significant blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses in areas with DREADD expression, but also in remote defined neural circuitry without DREADD expression. The time-course of brain activation corresponded with the behavioral output measure, i. e. locomotor (hyper) activity, in the mesolimbic pathway-targeted group. Chemogenetic activation specifically increased neuronal activity, whereas functional connectivity assessed with resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) remained stable. Positive and negative BOLD responses distinctively reflected simultaneous ventral pallidum activation and substantia nigra pars reticulata deactivation, respectively, demonstrating the concept of mesocorticolimbic network activity with concurrent activation of the direct and indirect pathways following stimulation of specific midbrain projection neurons. The presented methodology provides straightforward and widely applicable opportunities to elucidate relationships between local neuronal activity and global network activity in a controllable manner, which will increase our understanding of the functioning and dysfunctioning of large-scale neuronal networks in health and disease...|$|E
40|$|Electrophysiology is an {{important}} technique using chronically-implanted electrode arrays, which allow for recording of neural activity in vivo during behavioral tasks that require cue and reward associations. Recordings are used to study how patterns of neural activity encode behaviorally-relevant information and how the disruption of this encoding can occur following cocaine experience. Behavioral testing and acute manipulations (such as <b>chemogenetics)</b> of associative behaviors can take place over several days. To precisely assess the progress of neural encoding over time, {{it is important to}} identify single unit neurons across multiple recording sessions. Here, we examined neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell of Sprague-Dawley rats during a Pavlovian first-order conditioning task. To establish whether neurons are identifiable across multiple sessions, cells were identified using multiple metrics. These included principal component analysis, waveform voltage patterns, inter-spike interval patterns, and autocorrelation. We demonstrate that cells show specific, regular features across each metric and could therefore be identified across multiple sessions. Next, we analyzed the associative learning-related encoding of an individual neuron under two conditions: CNO-induced inhibition of hM 4 Di-expressing DREADDs in the shell on one day, and a control saline injection on the other. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we us as an example a single unit that was determined to be the same across CNO and saline conditions by waveform and autocorrelogram analysis. We found that this cell exhibited differential firing patterns under each condition, indicating variable selectivity of cue encoding and motivated approaches to cues and foodcups...|$|E
40|$|Serotonin (5 -HT) {{neurotransmission}} affects {{behaviors and}} neuro-physiological functions via the orchestrated recruitment of distributed neural systems. Human imaging studies have employed pharmacological manipulations {{to probe the}} brainwide substrates targeted by serotonin. However, systemic drug manipulations often lack neural and receptorial specificity, and result in combined central and peripheral contributions that cannot be easily disentangled. As a result, it remains unclear whether and how serotonergic activity specifically influences regional or global functional activity. Here we combine DREADD-based <b>chemogenetics</b> and mouse fMRI, an approach we term “chemo-fMRI”, to causally probe the brainwide substrates endogenously modulated by phasic 5 -HT neurons stimulation. To this aim, I generated of two conditional knock-in mouse models that, crossed with Pet 1 -Cre-transgenic mice, allowed us to remotely stimulate serotonergic transmission during fMRI scans. I show that chemogenetic stimulations of 5 -HT system results in a composite pattern of activation encompassing parieto-cortical, hippocampal, and midbrain structures, as well as ventro-striatal components of the mesolimbic reward systems. Many of the activated regions also exhibit increased c-Fos immunostaining upon stimulation in freely-behaving mice, supporting a neural origin of the observed activation. Collectively, these findings identify a set of regional substrates that act as primary functional targets of endogenous serotonergic stimulation, and establish causation between phasic activation of 5 -HT neurons and regional fMRI signals. They further highlight a functional cross-talk between 5 -HT and mesolimbic dopaminergic, and provide a novel framework for understanding 5 -HT-dependent functions and interpreting data obtained from human fMRI studies of serotonin modulating agents...|$|E
40|$|SummaryFunctional {{imaging and}} psychometric {{assessments}} indicate that bright light can enhance mood, attention, and cognitive performance in humans. Indirect evidence links these events to light detection by intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) [1 – 9]. However, {{there is currently}} no direct demonstration that mRGCs can have such an immediate effect on mood or behavioral state in any species. We addressed this deficit by using <b>chemogenetics</b> to selectively activate mRGCs, simulating the excitatory effects of bright light on this cell type in dark-housed mice. This specific manipulation evoked circadian phase resetting and pupil constriction (known consequences of mRGC activation). It also induced c-Fos (a marker of neuronal activation) in multiple nuclei in the hypothalamus (paraventricular, dorsomedial, and lateral hypothalamus), thalamus (paraventricular and centromedian thalamus), and limbic system (amygdala and nucleus accumbens). These regions influence numerous aspects of autonomic and neuroendocrine activity and are typically active during periods of wakefulness or arousal. By contrast, c-Fos was absent from the ventrolateral preoptic area (active during sleep). In standard behavioral tests (open field and elevated plus maze), mRGC activation induced behaviors commonly interpreted as anxiety like or as signs of increased alertness. Similar changes in behavior could be induced by bright light in wild-type and rodless and coneless mice, but not melanopsin knockout mice. These data demonstrate that mRGCs drive a light-dependent switch in behavioral motivation toward a more alert, risk-averse state. They also highlight the ability of this small fraction of retinal ganglion cells to realign activity in brain regions defining widespread aspects of physiology and behavior...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Hypothalamic {{dysfunction}} is a {{key feature}} of several neuropsychiatric disease states, including those involving reward-related deficits such as depression. Interestingly, exposure to early life adverse events, such as childhood trauma, typically precipitates the development of depression in adulthood. Most preclinical research regarding early life stress (ELS) has focussed on neuroendocrine cell populations. However, the lateral hypothalamus (LH) is also known to influence autonomic, neuroendocrine and behavioural responses to stress but its role in depressive-like behaviours such as low motivational drive is less well studied and was therefore {{the focus of this}} thesis. Within the LH there are several neuronal populations expressing GABA, and glutamate as well as neuropeptides such as orexin (hypocretin) and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). Notably, orexin has been implicated in reward-seeking pathways focussing on drug (cocaine) and natural reward-seeking behaviour (high fat and sugar foods). The overarching aim of my thesis was to assess the role of the hypothalamic orexin system in models of ELS in precipitating behaviours relevant to neuropsychiatric disease states such as suppressed reward-seeking behaviour. Using behavioural techniques and neural activity mapping, I first demonstrated that our model of ELS (maternal separation) suppressed motivated arousal in response to restraint stress in adulthood; an effect that was associated with a reduction in the percentage of Fos-positive orexin cells. Interestingly, voluntary wheel-running reversed both behavioural and neural deficits observed after ELS. A question that arose from these studies was whether these deficits in reward-seeking were produced by specific circuits within the LH. Further, given the difficulty in overcoming deficits in motivational drive, and in many cases an inability to exercise to beneficial levels in depressed individuals, I wanted to assess the feasibility of manipulating LH circuits pharmacologically to reverse ELS-induced deficits. To achieve my second aim, I applied for and received a prestigious travel grant from the Hunter Medical Research Institute to study at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Baltimore, USA to learn a novel technique termed <b>chemogenetics.</b> Professor Yavin Shaham’s lab at NIDA had recently employed <b>chemogenetics</b> to isolate specific circuits in the LH. At NIDA I used a dual-virus approach to inhibit ventral subiculum to nucleus acumbens shell projection neurons. Selective inhibition of this pathway decreased contextinduced relapse to alcohol seeking in rats. Upon returning to the University of Newcastle, I implemented these chemogenetic approaches to my model of ELS. I showed that chemogenetic activation of the LH reversed ELS-induced deficits in the motivation to lever press for a sucrose reward. Interestingly, this recovery of sucrose responding was associated with increases in the number of Fos-positive orexin neurons; but also a significant number of non-orexin, putative GABAergic neurons were recruited. In the final chapter of my thesis, I sought to determine if the orexin system was also altered following another type of ELS, exposure to an early life immune challenge lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is an endotoxin bacterial cell wall product modelling the prevalence of bacterial immune stimuli in the perinatal human environment. Interestingly, early life LPS followed by formalin-induced inflammatory pain in adulthood resulted in {{an increase in the number}} of Fos-positive orexin cells. Together the data from my thesis indicate that that ELS rewires LH-orexin circuitry, as well as other LH projection pathways, and that these changes manifest as inappropriate behavioural responses to psychological and physical challenges in later life. Interestingly, exercise and chemogenetic activation of the LH is able to reverse the behavioural deficits produced by ELS. These data are important clinically because they suggest that capacity remains in LH circuitry, to overcome ELS-induced deficits in motivational drive...|$|E

Because of the close association of HFOs with epileptogenic tissue and ictogenesis, understanding their cellular and network mechanisms could provide valuable information about the organization of epileptogenic networks and how seizures emerge from the abnormal activity of these networks. In this review, we summarize the most recent advances {{in the field of}} HFOs and provide a critical evaluation of new observations within the context of already established knowledge. Recent improvements in recording technology and the introduction of optogenetics into epilepsy research have intensified experimental work on HFOs. Using advanced computer models, new cellular substrates of epileptic HFOs were identified and the role of specific neuronal subtypes in HFO genesis was determined. Traditionally, the pathogenesis of HFOs was explored mainly in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and in animal models mimicking this condition. HFOs have also been reported to occur in other epileptic disorders and models such as neocortical epilepsy, genetically determined epilepsies, and infantile spasms, which further support the significance of HFOs in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. It is increasingly recognized that HFOs are generated by multiple mechanisms at both the cellular and network levels. Future studies on HFOs combining novel high-resolution in vivo imaging techniques and precise control of neuronal behavior using optogenetics or <b>chemogenetics</b> will provide evidence about the causal role of HFOs in seizures and epileptogenesis. Detailed understanding of the pathophysiology of HFOs will propel better HFO classification and increase their information yield for clinical and diagnostic purposes.

40|$|Sodium is an {{essential}} element, but {{in the modern world}} average salt intake is too high and this is associated with a significant disease burden. In most mammals, depletion of salt leads to a profound behavioural change. This is termed salt appetite. The components of salt appetite are motivation for, ingestion of and enjoyment for hypertonic saline (which is aversive in the salt replete state). Deciphering the neuronal circuits that drive salt seeking behaviour may enable possible future manipulation of pathological salt appetite. Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons play key roles in motivated behaviours. I therefore hypothesise that the mesolimbic dopamine system is {{an essential}} component of the circuits driving salt seeking behaviour. To test this idea I studied the effect that manipulation of dopamine neuron activity has on salt appetite. My first step required the establishment of a reliable salt appetite in mice. To achieve this I used a combination of low salt feed and furosemide-induced natriuresis. I quantified the appetite for salt by measuring the intake of salt jellies of varying concentrations in a canteen setup. To control the firing rate of the dopamine neurons I have used optogenetics and <b>chemogenetics.</b> Strikingly, optogenetic excitation of dopamine neurons decreased salt intake in a rapid and reversible manner, despite a strong salt appetite. Importantly, optogenetic stimulation was not aversive, did not induce hyperactivity, and did not interfere with salt concentration preferences when there was no appetite. Optogenetic inhibition, chemogenetic excitation, and chemogenetic inhibition experiments suggested that a ‘burst-like’ pattern of excitation was important to the reduction in salt intake. In addition, optogenetic excitation of dopamine neurons reduced consumption of sucrose following an overnight fast, indicating a more general role of VTA dopamine neuron excitation in suppressing appetite.
