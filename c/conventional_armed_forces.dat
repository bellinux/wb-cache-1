5|$|As part of post-Cold War restructuring, NATO's {{military}} {{structure was}} cut back and reorganized, with new forces {{such as the}} Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps established. The changes {{brought about by the}} collapse of the Soviet Union on the military balance in Europe were recognized in the Adapted <b>Conventional</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> in Europe Treaty, which was signed in 1999. The policies of French President Nicolas Sarkozy resulted in a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4April 2009, which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure, while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.|$|E
5|$|Instead, the Spanish {{government}} {{opted to}} replace its older Patton tanks with American M60 Patton tanks retired from Central Europe {{in accordance with}} the Treaty on <b>Conventional</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> in Europe. Although the Spanish army was originally to receive 532 M60 and M60A1 tanks, only 260 M60A3s were ultimately delivered, of which 244 were put into active service in the army. In the late 1980s the Spanish Ministry of Defense approved a modernization program for 150 of its AMX-30Es and a reconstruction program for the remaining 149 vehicles of this type, restoring them to their original condition. However, neither the M60s nor the AMX-30s were a considerable improvement over Spain's fleet of M47 and M48 Patton tanks.|$|E
5|$|The Revolutions of 1989 and the {{dissolution}} of the Warsaw Pact in 1991 removed the de facto main adversary of NATO and caused a strategic re-evaluation of NATO's purpose, nature, tasks, and their focus on the continent of Europe. This shift started with the 1990 signing in Paris of the Treaty on <b>Conventional</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> in Europe between NATO and the Soviet Union, which mandated specific military reductions across the continent that continued after {{the dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in December 1991. At that time, European countries accounted for 34 percent of NATO's military spending; by 2012, this had fallen to 21 percent. NATO also began a gradual expansion to include newly autonomous Central and Eastern European nations, and extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish {{government}} decided to upgrade its fleet of AMX-30Es {{in the late}} 1980s. The focus on upgrading Spain's AMX-30E's distracted attention from the Lince plan, which was eventually shelved in 1990 after Spain acquired {{a large number of}} M60 Patton tanks, which were no longer required by the U.S., in accordance with the Treaty on <b>Conventional</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> in Europe. These tanks replaced the M47s and M48s, and fulfilled Spain's need to modernize its tank forces in the short term. No prototype of the planned Lince tank was manufactured, and no announcements were made on who would receive the contract. Four years later the Spanish government procured and locally manufactured the Leopard 2, fulfilling the long-term modernisation goal established in the Lince programme.|$|E

25|$|In June 1989, the 911th Regiment was {{transferred}} to Brand airfield in East Germany (now the Tropical Islands Resort theme park), and {{became part of the}} 105th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Division. In November 1990, according to data exchanged by the Treaty on <b>Conventional</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> in Europe, the regiment included 32 MiG-27s and 10 MiG-23UMs. As Soviet troops withdrew from Germany, the regiment was briefly transferred to Finsterwalde on 22 June 1992, but returned to Lida on 6 July. At Lida, it became part of the 26th Air Army of the Belarusian Air Force and on 12 August was finally transferred to Baranovichi. The 911th Fighter-Bomber Regiment was disbanded in 1993, and its aircraft scrapped.|$|E
50|$|When World War II reached Norway {{with the}} Nazi German invasion, Siem fought {{for his country}} in the Battle of Hegra Fortress. After the <b>conventional</b> Norwegian <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> capitulated, Siem {{returned}} to his job at Akers Mekaniske Verksted. While working there he became an informant for the secret intelligence organization RMO, which was established in 1942. His information on the Port of Oslo became especially important for Norwegian ship saboteurs, such as Max Manus, Gregers Gram and Roy Nielsen. When the leader of RMO, A.K. Rygg, had to flee {{the country in the}} autumn 1943, Siem took over the leadership together with Sigurd Sverdrup. Among the results of Siem's information was the sabotage towards SS Donau.|$|R
50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, in {{comparison}} with <b>conventional</b> operations the <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> involved operate at a greatly reduced tempo, with fewer soldiers, a reduced range of tactical equipment and limited scope to operate in a military manner. For example, the use of air power, pivotal in modern warfare, is often relegated to transport and surveillance. Artillery is often not used when LIC occurs in populated areas. The role of the <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> {{is dependent on the}} stage of the insurrection, whether it has progressed to armed struggle or is in an early stage of propaganda and protests.|$|R
5000|$|The gap in {{strategy}} today (from a Western viewpoint) is {{in what the}} Americans call [...] "asymmetric warfare": the battle against guerrilla <b>forces</b> by <b>conventional</b> national <b>armed</b> <b>forces.</b> The classical strategic triumvirate of politics/military/populace is very weak against protracted warfare of paramilitary forces such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army, Hezbollah, ETA, PKK, and Al-Qaeda. The ability of conventional forces to deliver utility (effect) from their hugely powerful forces is largely nullified by the difficulties of distinguishing and separating combatants from the civilian populace in whose company they hide. The use of the military by the politicians to police areas seen as bases for these guerrillas leads to them becoming targets themselves which eventually undermines {{the support of the}} populace from whom they come and whose values they represent.|$|R
25|$|These events, {{along with}} accusations of Georgian {{involvement}} in the Second Chechen War, resulted in a severe deterioration of relations with Russia, fuelled also by Russia's open assistance and support to the two secessionist areas. Despite these increasingly difficult relations, in May 2005 Georgia and Russia reached a bilateral agreement by which Russian military bases (dating back to the Soviet era) in Batumi and Akhalkalaki were withdrawn. Russia withdrew all personnel and equipment from these sites by December 2007 while failing {{to withdraw from the}} Gudauta base in Abkhazia, which it was required to vacate after the adoption of the Adapted <b>Conventional</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> in Europe Treaty during the 1999 Istanbul summit.|$|E

During 2002 and 2003 Russian military officials destroyed a further 51 armoured vehicles, {{all of which were}} types not limited by the CFE Treaty. The OSCE also observed and verified the withdrawal of 48 trains with military equipment and ammunition in 2003. However, no further withdrawal activities have taken place since March 2004 and a further 20,000 tons of ammunition, as well as some remaining military equipment are still to be removed.|$|E
25|$|In March 1952, the 20th IAD and the 180th were {{relocated}} to Veshchevo airfield in Leningrad Oblast.

In 1961 it {{became part of the}} 18th Air Defence Corps after the 20th IAD was disbanded. The regiment was reequipped with the newer Sukhoi Su-15 in March 1969, receiving the Su-15TM variant in June 1978. Between April 1980 and April 1986, the 180th was directly subordinated to the VVS Leningrad Military District. The regiment then became part of the 54th Air Defence Corps of the 6th Air Defence Army. The regiment replaced its Su-15s with Mikoyan MiG-31 interceptors in June 1988. In November 1990, the regiment, according to Treaty on <b>Conventional</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> in Europe data, had 31 MiG-31s. By 2000 it had 28 MiG-31s and was disbanded on 1 July 2002.|$|E

25|$|Overcoming Soviet {{objections}} to a united Germany's membership in NATO was of key importance. This was accomplished in July when the alliance, led by President George H.W. Bush, issued the London Declaration on a transformed NATO. On 16 July, President Gorbachev and Chancellor Kohl announced the {{agreement in principle}} on a united Germany in NATO. This {{cleared the way for}} the signing in Moscow, on 12 September, of the Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany—in effect the peace treaty that was anticipated at the end of World War II. In addition to terminating Four Power rights, the treaty mandated the withdrawal of all Soviet forces from Germany by the end of 1994, made clear that the current borders (especially the Oder-Neisse line) were viewed as final and definitive, and specified the right of a united Germany to belong to NATO. It also provided for the continued presence of British, French, and American troops in Berlin during the interim period of the Soviet withdrawal. In the treaty, the Germans renounced nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and stated their intention to reduce the (combined) German armed forces to 370,000 within 3 to 4 years after the Treaty on <b>Conventional</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> in Europe, signed in Paris on 19 November 1990, entered into force.|$|E
25|$|On 21 October 1994, Russia and Moldova {{signed an}} {{agreement}} that committed Russia to {{the withdrawal of the}} troops in three years from the date of entry into force of the agreement; this did not come into effect, however, because the Russian Duma did not ratify it. The Treaty on <b>Conventional</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> in Europe (CFE) included a paragraph about the removal of Russian troops from Moldova's territory and was introduced into the text of the OSCE Summit Declaration of Istanbul (1999) in which Russia had committed itself to pulling out its troops from Transnistria by the end of 2002. However, even after 2002, the Russian parliament did not ratify the Istanbul accords. On 19 July 2004, after it finally passed through parliament President Vladimir Putin signed the Law on the ratification of the CFE Treaty in Europe, which committed Russia to remove the heavy armaments limited by this Treaty. During 2000–2001, although the CFE Treaty was not fully ratified, to comply with it, Moscow withdrew 125 pieces of Treaty Limited Equipment (TLE) and 60 railway wagons containing ammunition from the Transnistrian region of Moldova. In 2002, Russia withdrew 3 military equipment trains (118 railway wagons) and 2 of ammunition (43 wagons) from the Transnistrian region of Moldova, and in 2003, 11 rail convoys transporting military equipment and 31 transporting ammunitions. According to the OSCE Mission to Moldova, of a total of 42,000 tons of ammunitions stored in Transnistria, 1,153 tons (3%) was transported back to Russia in 2001, 2,405 tons (6%) in 2002 and 16,573 tons (39%) in 2003.|$|E
