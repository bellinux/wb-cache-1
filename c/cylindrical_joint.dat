The geared multibody system is described by using the Absolute-Coordinate-Based (ACB) method that combines the Natural Coordinate Formulation (NCF) describing rigid bodies and the Absolute Nodal Coordinate Formulation (ANCF) characterizing the flexible bodies. Based on the finite-short bearing approach, the EHD lubrication condition for the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>joints</b> supporting the geared system is considered here. The lubrication forces developed at the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>joints</b> are obtained by solving the Reynolds’ equation via the finite difference method. For {{the evaluation of the}} normal contact forces of gear pair along the Line Of Action (LOA), the time-varying mesh stiffness, mesh damping and Static Transmission Error (STE) are utilized. The time-varying mesh stiffness is calculated by using the Chaari’s methodology. The forces of sliding friction along the Off-Line-Of-Action (OLOA) are computed by using the Coulomb friction models with a time-varying coefficient of friction under the EHD lubrication condition of gear teeth.

40|$|WOSInternational audienceThis {{study is}} {{concerned}} with increasing the performance of adhesively bonded structures. Adhesively bonded joints offer many advantages, but stress singularities {{can contribute to the}} initiation and the propagation of crack in adhesive joints. Therefore, designing adhesively bonded joints which strongly limit the influence of edge effects can significantly increases the transmitted load by the assembly. <b>Cylindrical</b> <b>joints</b> are associated with high substrate strength in the radial direction, meaning that peel and cleavage forces have different effects compared to simple lap joints. But, for such assemblies, edge effects also exist. The aim of this paper is first to analyse stress concentrations in <b>cylindrical</b> <b>joints</b> in the case of axial loadings, starting from refined finite element computations under a linear elastic assumption. Thus as the stress state in the adhesive thickness can be complex associated to edge effects, simplified methods can lead to an overestimation of the transmitted load by the assembly as they generally are not able to represent effects of stress concentrations in the adhesive thickness. Secondly, geometries which strongly limit the influence of edge effects are proposed.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to model and analyze flexible spatial multibody systems with clearance cylindrical joints is presented throughout this work. The flexible parts are modeled by using the absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) based elements, while the rigid parts are described by employing the natural coordinate formulation (NCF), {{which can lead to}} a constant system mass matrix for the final derived system equations of motion. In a simple way, a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>joint</b> with clearance is composed by two main elements, that is, a journal inside a bearing. Additionally, a lubricant fluid can exist between these two mechanical elements to reduce the friction, wear and increase the system’s life. For the case in which the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>joint</b> with clearance is modeled as a dry contact pair, a technique using a continuous approach for the evaluation of the contact force is applied, where the energy dissipation in form of hysteresis damping is considered. Furthermore, the frictional forces developed in those contacts are evaluated using a modified Coulomb’s friction law. For the lubricated case, the hydrodynamic theory for dynamically loaded journal-bearings is used to compute the forces generated by lubrication actions. The lubricated model is based on the Reynolds’ equation developed for the case of journal-bearings in which the length-to-diameter ratios are up to 1. With this approach, the misalignment of the journal inside the bearing can be studied. Finally, two demonstrative examples of application are used to provide the results that support the discussion and show the validity of the proposed methodologies.

[Int J Adhes Adhes 2006; 26 (6) : 474]. Nemes paper gives an analytical solution for the different stresses that appear on the three elements of the cylindrical assembly (two tubes and the adhesive) over the whole joining surface. A detailed study of this paper allowed us {{to develop a new}} mathematical model to be applied to a pin-and-collar specimen, in particular to the standard system, which appears in ISO 10123. From the mechanical and geometrical properties of the components and the axial loading applied on the system, it has been possible to obtain the intensity and distribution of stresses in the assembly graphically, using the mathematical program MathCAD. Consequently, it is possible to calculate the so far unknown value of maximum shear stress. So knowing the shear stress, the model allows (i) to predict the distribution of stresses in the adhesive bond and (ii) to carry out a parametric study of the bond; that is to say, it allows to evaluate the influence of geometrical parameters and the influence of the selected adhesive in the stress distribution within the bond. It is, therefore, a methodology, which will make possible to calculate, quickly and simply, the distribution of stresses and the maximum shear strength in the adhesive. Moreover, it makes unnecessary to carry out numerous mechanical tests. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|The use and {{implementation}} of adhesive joints for space structures is necessary for incorporating fiber-reinforced composite materials. Correct modeling and design of cylindrical adhesive joints can increase the dimensional stability of space structures. The few analytical models for cylindrical adhesive joints do not fully describe the displacement or stress field of the joint. A two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element model for the design and analysis of adhesive joints was developed. The model was developed solely {{for the analysis of}} cylindrical adhesive joints, but the energy techniques used to develop the model can be applied to other types of joints as well. A numerical program was written to solve the system of equations [K]{d}={R} for the unknown displacements {d}. The displacements found from the program are used to design cylindrical adhesive joints based on dimensional stability. Stresses were calculated from the displacements for comparison with analytical models. The cylindrical joints were assumed to remain within the linear elastic region and no failure criteria was taken into account. The design process for cylindrical joints was developed based on dimensional stability. The nodal displacements found from the finite element model were used in the optimization of geometric parameters of cylindrical joints. The stacking sequence of the composite, the bond length, and the bond thickness were found to have the greatest impact on dimensional stability. Other factors that were found to further reduce the maximum displacements are the implementation of 0 ° and 90 ° laminas, the isotropic cylinder thickness, tapering of the isotropic cylinder, and the inside radius of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>joint.</b> This axisymmetric finite element model is beneficial in that a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>joint</b> can be designed before any testing is performed.

For the calculation of adhesive stresses, JointCalc implements the analytical elastic solutions available in the literature for the fundamental joint geometries (single and double-lap joints, single and double-strap joints, peel <b>joints</b> and <b>cylindrical</b> <b>joints).</b> A key aspect of JointCalc is the experimental failure criterion adopted, represented by an admissible region in the peel-shear stress plane.

This paper deals with stress analysis in coaxial bonded joints. The objective was to analyze the effect of various geometries of the different parts of the assembly in order to optimize the maximal transmitted load of such joints. In the case of tensile loads, the stress distributions were analyzed using axisymmetric theory of elasticity. A pressure-dependent elastic limit of the adhesive was used, in order to accurately represent the difference between tensile-shear and compression-shear loads in the mechanical response of the adhesive. In adhesively bonded joints, stress concentrations can contribute to the initiation and propagation of cracks in the adhesive. Therefore, designing adhesively bonded assemblies which strongly limit stress concentrations can significantly increase the load transmitted by the assembly. Moreover, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>joints</b> are associated with high substrate strength in the radial direction, meaning that peel and cleavage forces have different effects compared to single lap joints.
