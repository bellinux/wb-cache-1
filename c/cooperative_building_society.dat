40|$|First paragraph: The {{attempt to}} devolve public {{services}} to ‘employee mutuals' is one {{element in the}} political agenda known as the ‘Big Society'. This specific policy initiative by the coalition government {{is surrounded by a}} broader interest in the idea of ‘mutuality' or ‘mutualism' as a new political principle encapsulating the idea of a revised relationship between the state and civil society. The promoters of the idea refer back to a time before the welfare state when ‘mutuals' such as friendly societies provided a radically different approach to meeting the needs of citizens based on self-help and mutual aid. For instance, in his Hugo Young memorial lecture in 2009, David Cameron described how an ‘ethos of mutuality' was present when the welfare state was created, a ‘vibrant panoply' of civic organisations such as <b>cooperatives,</b> friendly <b>societies,</b> <b>building</b> <b>societies</b> and guilds. He drew from this the lesson that the state had subsequently squeezed out self-help and mutual responsibility, and that it has to become an instrument for giving power back to society...|$|R
40|$|Newly build {{buildings}} in the Netherlands are quite sustainable but are currently less that 5 % of {{the total amount of}} <b>buildings.</b> <b>Cooperative</b> <b>building</b> <b>societies</b> are getting requirements from the European Union which they have to meet in a few years (Action Plan for Energy Efficiency: Realising the Potential). The target is to reduce the current energy consumption (heating and electricity) of buildings with 20 % in 2020. The hypothesis is that with the correctly selected type of heat pump, with or without the combination with a CHP in the right proportions, a heating unit configuration exists with which mid to high temperature heating can be achieved in existing apartment {{buildings in}} the Netherlands, in a sustainable and cost effective way. Three heat pumps types were highlighted and explained, the Vapor Compression Heat Pump (VCHP), the Gas Absorption Heat Pump (GAHP) and the Compression Absorption Heat Pump (CAHP). Based on the yearly average temperature and the required temperature gain for the central heating water, the CAHP was the most economical option according to data from literature. The CAHP was investigated in more detail. When the heat pump was only able to deliver 336 kWth, the best investment and annual savings relation was obtained. With this configuration the heat pump is able to fully cover the 30 - 50 ºC temperature range only. At higher required temperature ranges the heat pump would only deliver a part (336 kWth) of the total heating demand, up to 400 kWth would be delivered by a CHP and the remaining heating demand would be provided by conventional boilers. Despite that the Net Present Value (NPV) for the CAHP is 13 % higher than the NPV for VCHP configuration, the latter is preferred. Since the CAHP is a rather new technology entering the market, more research is required in order to decrease the involved risk and uncertainties of the system.

40|$|The {{financial}} {{systems in}} most developing countries today {{have many features}} {{in common with the}} financial systems of the developing countries of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Whether they had unlimited liability (as in Scotland in the eighteenth century), or limited liability and special charters, commercial banks dominated European and U. S. financial systems. Moreover, they were typically established by wealthy people and oriented toward busineses and other wealthy people - they effectively represented"banking for the rich by the rich. "Insurance companies were underdeveloped and pension and mutual funds did not yet exist. As a result, middle- and low-income people had limited access to formal financial services and relied on informal arrangements for borrowing. Meanwhile, financial savings were unproductively hoarded under the mattress. In developing countries today this gap in the provision of financial services {{can be explained by the}} low level and unequal distribution of income and wealth, high information and transaction costs, and weak enforcement mechanisms. In Europe and the United States, over time, different types of institutions - including savings banks, credit <b>cooperatives,</b> <b>building</b> <b>societies,</b> and credit unions - emerged to fill this market gap. Many developing countries have created institutions that specialize in lending to the poor, but more must be done to help these institutions reach the poor in rural areas and assist small farmers, artisans, and traders. An integrated program to build solid institutions requires 5 elements for success: 1) strong leadership. (Support should be given to groups, such as the Church or local officials, likely to attract people with integrity, high ideals, and committment to the institution's success.); 2) a three tier structure; 3) strong emphasis on education and dissemination of information about the workings and benefits of the institution. (Culture can be an obstacle to a thrift institution's success, as the Irish experience shows); 4) an official policy that encourages self-help and avoids total reliance on external funding. External support could be made dependent on local resource mobilization and record of monitoring and repayment; and 5) most importantly, the encouragement of active peer monitoring and the enforcement of contractual obligations. The principal of unlimited liability may not be viable in most developing countries, but government could support only regional units and local institutions that have a good record of loan repayment.
