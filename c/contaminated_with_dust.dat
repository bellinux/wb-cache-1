The table shows that at a temperature of 800 C has a very short time in the drying process. This is due to the drying air temperature is higher, the evaporation process occurs at a greater material, so that the water content of the evaporated material is also getting larger, consequently the rate of decrease in water content materials are also getting bigger and the time required for drying would be more brief. The rate of decrease in water content of the material in the drying process is influenced by the temperature in the cabinet dryer. The higher the temperature of drying the moisture content in the materials will be more rapid decline. The mechanism of drying that occur in the cabinet dryer is water that is on the surface material (dried) evaporates into the air. Drying leaves this tempuyung tempuyung produce tea leaves. The optimum temperature for drying the leaves tempuyung is 800 C. It can be shown by the results of the tea leaves at a temperature of 800 C tempuyung have dark green color with the most rapid drying time of 2. 5 hours.

40|$|Melt-infiltrated carbon/carbon {{composites}} (C/C-SiC) {{have already}} proven their applicability to different light-weight structures in thermal protection systems of spacecraft and rockets. One new {{application of these}} composites is their use as brake pads in high performance brake systems of lifts, cranes and other transport systems. In this case, the brake system does not act as a service brake as it is used in passenger cars and high speed trains, but acts as an emergency brake system in case of power failure for example. The main requirements on the brake system are to reduce the velocity constantly, {{and to keep the}} load reliably in position. The tribological counterpart is a metallic guide rail whose surface can be <b>contaminated</b> <b>with</b> <b>dust,</b> oil and preservative agents. Conventional braking materials like organic or sintermetallic pads reached their limits with respect to thermal stability, wear resistance and frictional behavior. Novel modifications of C/C-SiC composites have been developed with high thermal and mechanical shock resistance, extremely low wear rates and high coefficients of friction under dynamic as well as stationary conditions. The tests have been conducted with small test samples as well as originally sized brake pads under practically relevant conditions. It could be shown, that the initial state of the metallic guide rail surface influences the friction coefficient essentially. Also, the phase composition of the C/C-SiC composite, namely on the friction surface, determines the friction behavior. High amounts of silicon carbide increase the wear resistance and friction coefficient, but reduce the impact resistance and mechanical strength of the material. As a compromise, graded composites with a symmetrical lay-up of fabric layers have been developed and were tested successfully. They consist of high amounts of carbon fibers in the center, resulting in quasi-ductile cores and surfaces with high SiC contents, resulting in outstanding tribological properties. From an economical point of view, short fiber reinforced C/C-SiC composites are of high interest. Also, modifications of the Liquid Silicon Infiltration process (LSI) with respect to shorter process times have been investigated. Corresponding samples were tested tribologically, showing a high potential for further cost reductions. This paper deals with the correlations between microstructure and mechanical and thermal as well as tribological properties of different C/C-SiC composites...|$|E

It furnishes unique diagnostics of e. g. magnetic fields and scattering media. This thesis presents new polarimetric concepts, instruments, and measurements targeting astronomical science questions. The {{first part of the}} thesis describes three novel polarimetric concepts. -A dedicated passive liquid crystal device known as a theta cell is introduced to enable one-shot observations of astronomical targets exhibiting a centrosymmetric polarization pattern. -A new passive measurement concept for broad-band linear polarization is introduced. It is based on a sinusoidal modulation of the spectrum, and is particularly suitable for instruments for which classical spatial and/or temporal polarization modulation is unfavorable. -Calibration of polarimetric instruments is usually limited by non-ideal effects of the calibration optics themselves. A mathematical frame-work based on Fourier analysis is introduced to tackle various non-ideal effects in polarimetric calibration. The second part of the thesis presents the designs and first results of three very different astronomical polarimeters. -The ultra-stable high-resolution HARPS spectrograph is successfully upgraded with a dual-beam polarimetric module. It furnishes direct observations of magnetic fields on stars. -The Small Synoptic Second Solar Spectrum Telescope (S 5 T) is designed to accurately monitor the variation of weak, turbulent magnetic fields on the Sun during a solar cycle. Such measurements are crucial for the understanding of local dynamo action in the solar photosphere. The prototype shows the feasibility of the instrument concept. -The Spectropolarimeter for Planetary EXpolaration (SPEX) is designed to study a planet's or moon's atmosphere from orbit. The additional information from the polarization measurement of scattered sunlight allows for determination of microphysical properties of atmospheric aerosols. The third part of the thesis presents new polarimetric measurements and observations. -A precise ellipsometer was constructed to measure the polarization properties of various optical components. The instrument was employed to measure the complete Mueller matrix of an aluminum mirror at various durations after evaporation.

Material and Methods: The study was conducted in the indoor solid waste sorting plant. Using Andersen impactor adapted to 1 plate at the flow rate of 30 l/min, indoor air was sampled in the workers’ breathing zone. Ergosterol was sampled using gelatinous filter (1000 l of air) and then analyzed by means of the spectrophotometric method. Fungi were sampled on malt extract agar (MEA) medium (3 replications: 2 l, 7. 5 l, 15 l of air) and analyzed by means of the culturable method. Based on ergosterol analyzes, concentration of fungi was calculated. Results were given as the range assuming min. as 5. 1 pg ergosterol/spore and max as 1. 7 pg ergosterol/spore. Results: The average concentrations of ergosterol in a working room (arithmetic mean (AM), standard deviation (SD); minimum–maximum (min. –max)) were, respectively: 2. 16, 0. 72; 0. 85 – 2. 92 μg/m 3; fungi calculated based on ergosterol – 424. 1 × 103 – 1272. 4 × 103, 140. 1 × 103 – 420. 4 × 103, 167 × 103 – 1716. 5 × 103 CFU/m 3, and culturable fungi – 13 × 103, 9. 7 × 103, 1. 9 × 103 – 34 × 103 CFU/m 3).

Observations that red albedo is much higher than blue albedo in the Martian south polar cap indicates that the snow or the atmosphere is <b>contaminated</b> <b>with</b> red <b>dust.</b> The absorption coefficient of CO 2 ice in the thermal infrared is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than that measured for H 2 O ice.

F 344 rats were exposed for 4 weeks (6 h/d; 5 d/wk) in nose-only inhalation chambers to concentrations of 0 (control air), 2. 1, 6. 1, 21, and 61 mg/m(exp 3) of lunar dust. Five rats per group were euthanized 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the last inhalation exposure. The total RNAs were isolated from the blood or lung tissue after being lavaged, using the Qigen RNeasy kit. The Rat Fibrosis RT 2 Profile PCR Array was used to profile the expression of 84 genes relevant to fibrosis. The genes with significant expression changes are identified and the gene expression data were further analyzed using IPA pathway analysis tool to determine the signaling pathways with significant changes...|$|R
40|$|A {{patient with}} {{hypersensitivity}} pneumonitis {{caused by a}} contaminated cool-mist vaporizer, a previously unreported association, is presented. Although several fungal and bacterial organisms were isolated from the vaporizer, the specific antigen to which the patient was sensitive was not identified. Further evaluation suggested that an insoluble, particulate antigen {{not related to the}} microorganisms isolated from the vaporizer was the causal agent. This case reemphasizes the need to suspect hypersensitivity pneumonitis in all patients with "recurrent pneumonia. " ALTHOUGH HYPERSENSITIVITY pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis) usually results from vocational or avocational exposure to the causative antigen (1, 2), recent evidence indicates that exposure to air that is <b>contaminated</b> <b>with</b> specific organic <b>dusts</b> from heat-ing or air conditioning systems may also cause severe pulmonary disability (3 - 6). Recently, we had the opportunity to study a patient who developed hyper-sensitivity pneumonitis after exposure to a cool-mist vaporizer, which apparently was not <b>contaminated</b> <b>with</b> any of the presently known organic-dust anti-gens. Case Report A 29 -year-old man first noticed the onset of dyspnea after climbing three flights of stairs in the fall of 1972. Although the dyspnea improved during a 2 -week vaca-tion in Florida and Louisiana, 1 week after returning • From the Naval Hospital, Great Lakes, Illinois; and the Clinical Re...|$|R
