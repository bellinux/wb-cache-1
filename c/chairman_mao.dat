5|$|As the Cultural Revolution {{erupted in}} 1966, <b>Chairman</b> <b>Mao</b> Zedong {{called for the}} {{destruction}} of the Four Olds, and teenage Red Guards rampaged through people's homes to destroy relics of pre-Communist China. Desperate Shanghai collectors sought protection of their antiques at the Shanghai Museum, and Ma slept in his office to take phone calls and to dispatch museum employees around the clock.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Jakarta, an {{epidemic}} of the flu is underway. Among those who fall ill is President Sukarno, who writes to <b>Chairman</b> <b>Mao</b> Zedong to request some doctors. Mao sends doctors, who give Sukarno poison to paralyze him and aid the 30 September Movement in overthrowing the government. The slow acting poison causes Sukarno to faint after he and his ministers have a large party with haraam events, including the consumption of pork and frog and zina (sex outside of marriage).|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by {{the rapid}} {{collapse}} of the KPA, China's <b>Chairman</b> <b>Mao</b> Zedong ordered the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier Force to be reorganized into the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) for the upcoming intervention in Korea. Despite Mao's determination to save North Korea from capitulation, the Chinese military leadership expressed doubts {{on the ability of}} the Chinese army to fight against the more modernized US forces. As a compromise, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a bridgehead building operation with limited offensives against only the South Korean forces while avoiding contacts with the US forces. Under strict secrecy, the PVA entered Korea on 19 October.|$|E

Under Mao's urgent orders, the 9th Corps Army was rushed into North Korea on 10 November. Undetected by UN intelligence, the 9th Corps Army quietly entered the Chosin Reservoir area on 17 November, with the 20th Corps of the 9th Army relieving the 42nd Corps near Yudami-ni.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the UN advances, China's <b>Chairman,</b> <b>Mao</b> Zedong, ordered the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier Force to enter North Korea and engage UN forces under the name People's Volunteer Army (PVA). In order to stabilize the rapidly collapsing Korean front and to push back the advancing UN forces, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a bridgehead-building operation {{with the aim of}} destroying the ROK II Corps, the vanguard and the right flank of the US Eighth Army, advancing up along the Taebaek Mountains {{in the middle of the}} peninsula. After the Chinese leadership finally settled the issue of armed intervention on October 18, Mao ordered the PVA to enter Korea on October 19 under strict secrecy.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} intellectuals, Chen was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution (1966–76). After being rehabilitated {{at the end}} of the period, Chen {{returned}} to work for the Shanghai Film Studio, where he was responsible for artistic quality. He and Chen Baichen worked together for three years to make the historical film Da Feng Ge, based on the Han Dynasty palace intrigues of Empress Lü Zhi after the death of Emperor Gaozu. However, the film was again cancelled by high-ranking politicians, as it was reminiscent of the political struggles after the death of <b>Chairman</b> <b>Mao</b> Zedong. Chen Baichen had a heart attack on hearing news of the cancellation, while Chen Liting, then almost 70 years old, retired from filmmaking.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the United Nations (UN) forces' {{successful}} landing at Inchon and the subsequent destruction of the Korean People's Army (KPA) by mid-1950, the Eighth United States Army crossed the 38th parallel and advanced rapidly towards the Sino-Korean border. Alarmed by this development, China's <b>Chairman</b> <b>Mao</b> Zedong ordered the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) to intervene in Korea and to launch the First Phase Campaign against the UN forces. Between October 25 and November 4, 1950, the PVA 13th Army surprised and defeated the Republic of Korea (ROK) II Corps and the US 1st Cavalry Division in a series of battles around Onjong and Unsan, destroying the right flank of the US Eighth Army while forcing the UN forces to retreat back to the Ch'ongch'on River. Although Chinese forces were able to break through the UN line, logistics difficulties forced the Chinese to withdraw on November 5, 1950.|$|E

25|$|The {{inspiration}} for the badges were <b>Chairman</b> <b>Mao</b> badges wore by the Chinese during the Cultural Revolution, although North Korean propaganda attributes the idea to Kim Jong-il.

25|$|China {{was soon}} engulfed in {{full-scale}} civil war. In 1949, the war turned decisively against the KMT and {{in favor of}} the CPC. On 1 October 1949, the CPC under <b>Chairman</b> <b>Mao</b> Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing. The capitalist ROC government retreated to Taiwan, eventually declaring Taipei its temporary capital in December 1949.|$|E
25|$|In {{subsequent}} {{conferences in}} March 1960 and May 1962, {{the negative effects}} of the Great Leap Forward were studied by the CPC, and Mao was criticized in the party conferences.

The adaptation's English title is I Am <b>Chairman</b> <b>Mao's</b> Bitch!, which derives from a famous quote by Jiang Qing during her 1980 trial (and also featured in the play): [...] "I was <b>Chairman</b> <b>Mao's</b> dog.

25|$|Most badges have an {{inscription}} on the reverse, which often recorded where the badge was made and, if appropriate, what special occasion it commemorated. In addition the reverse may also feature a revolutionary slogan, a quotation from Mao, or respectful wishes for long life to <b>Chairman</b> <b>Mao.</b> Thus each obverse design may {{have hundreds of}} different varieties with different reverse inscriptions, being produced {{in different parts of}} the country or to commemorate different events.|$|E
25|$|The {{deterioration}} {{of relations between}} China and Soviet Union disrupted subway planning. Soviet experts began to leave in 1960, and were completely withdrawn by 1963. In 1961, the entire project was halted temporarily due to severe hardships caused by the Great Leap Forward. Eventually, planning work resumed. The route of the initial line was shifted westward to create an underground conduit to move personnel {{from the heart of}} the capital to the Western Hills. On February4, 1965, <b>Chairman</b> <b>Mao</b> Zedong personally approved the project.|$|E
25|$|The typical <b>Chairman</b> <b>Mao</b> badges of the Cultural Revolution {{period were}} made from an {{aluminium}} base, either coloured gold or left silver, covered with a red plastic pattern, to produce a red and gold or a red and silver design. Other colours were also used sometimes, such as yellow for a field of sunflowers as a background to Mao. In addition to the typical aluminium and plastic badges, badges were also made in other materials, such as porcelain, bamboo, perspex and plastic, but these made up {{only a tiny fraction}} of the total number of badges produced.|$|E
