40|$|VP 2 {{protein is}} the primary host-protective {{immunogen}} of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). His 249 and His 253 are two surface histidine residues in IBDV subviral particles (SVP), which is formed by twenty VP 2 trimers when the VP 2 protein of a local isolate is expressed. Here, a systemic study was performed to investigate His 249 or/and His 253 on self-assembly, cell attachment and immunogenicity of SVP. Point-mutagenesis of either or both histidine residues to alanine did not affect self-assembly of the SVP, but the SVP lost its Ni-NTA binding affinity when the His 253 was mutated. Indirect immunofluorescence assays and inhibitory experiments also showed that His 253 is essential for SVP to attach onto the DF- 1 cells and to inhibit IBDV infection of DF- 1 cells. Finally, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and <b>chicken</b> <b>protection</b> assays demonstrated that SVP with a mutation of His 253 to alanine induced comparable neutralizing antibody titers in chickens as the wild-type SVP did. It was concluded that VP 2 's His 253, a site not significant for the overall immunogenicity induced by SVP, is crucial for the binding affinity of SVP to Ni-NTA and the attachment of an IBDV host cell line. This is the first paper to decipher the role of His 253 played in receptor interaction and immunogenicity...|$|E
40|$|A gene {{encoding}} {{a structural}} protein (VP 2) {{of a local}} strain (P 3009) of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) was cloned and expressed using the baculovirus expression system to develop a subunit vaccine against IBDV infection in Taiwan. The expressed rVP 2 proteins formed particles of approximately 20 - 30 nm in diameter. Those particles were partially purified employing sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, and the purified particles were recognized by a monoclonal antibody against the VP 2 protein of IBDV P 3009. To facilitate the purification of the particles, the VP 2 protein was engineered to incorporate a metal ion binding site (His) (6) at its C-terminus. The chimeric rVP 2 H proteins also formed particles, which could be affinity;purified in one step with immobilized metal ions (Ni 2 +). Particle formation was confirmed by direct observation under the electron microscope. The production level of rVP 2 H protein {{was determined to be}} 20 mg/L in a batch culture of Hi- 5 cells by quantifying the concentration of the purified proteins. The <b>chicken</b> <b>protection</b> assay was performed to evaluate the immunogenicity of the rVP 2 H protein. When susceptible chickens were inoculated with the recombinant rVP 2 H proteins (40 mu g/bird), virus-neutralizing antibodies were induced, thereby conferring a high level of protection against the challenge of a very virulent strain of IBDV. In conclusion, the most significant finding in this work is that both of the expressed rVP 2 and rVP 2 H proteins can form a particulate structure capable of inducing a strong immunological response in a vaccinated chicken.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{an alternative approach}} to produce rVP 2 H protein using insect larvae of the cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni as hosts {{for the expression of}} the protein. The chimeric rVP 2 H protein, having an extra six histidine residues at the C-terminus of the VP 2, a structural protein of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), is a vaccine candidate for the prevention of infectious bursal disease. The chimeric rVP 2 H protein was expressed in insect larvae in form of virus-like particles, in which they maintain their native immunogenic properties. The expression level of rVP 2 H protein in T ni larvae was estimated to be approximately 0. 4 mg/g of larvae or 0. 2 mg/larvae. The rVP 2 H particles have a uniform morphology of dodecahedral structure with a size of 23 nm in diameter, and the particles could be affinity-purified in one step with immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) from the larvae homogenate. The recovery of rVP 2 H protein was approximately 55 % following IMAC and the protein was obtained with a purity of around 90 %. An additional purification step of ammonium sulphate precipitation was added to speed up the process of microfiltration and ultrafiltration of the homogenate prior to IMAC. This step enhanced the final purity of rVP 2 H protein to 99 %, demonstrating that the purification protocol developed herein was a powerful strategy for obtaining highly pure rVP 2 H protein from insect larvae. The immunogenicity and protective properties of the larvae-derived rVP 2 H protein were evaluated using a <b>chicken</b> <b>protection</b> assay. When larvae-derived rVP 2 H protein was intramuscularly injected into specific-pathogen-free chickens (20 mug/bird), high titres of virus-neutralizing antibodies were induced and the chickens were protected from the infection of a very virulent strain of IBDV isolated locally.

40|$|Circulation of {{genotype}} VII Newcastle disease virus (NDV) has posed a great threat for {{the poultry}} industry worldwide. Antibodies against Hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), a membrane protein of NDV with critical roles in NDV infection, {{have been reported}} to provide <b>chickens</b> <b>protection</b> from NDV infection. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the in vivo antibody responses against the linear antigenic domains of the HN protein from genotype VII NDV using a yeast surface display system. The results revealed four distinct regions of HN, P 1 (1 - 52 aa), P 2 (53 - 192 aa), P 3 (193 - 302 aa) and P 4 (303 - 571 aa), respectively, according to their antigenic potency. Analysis by FACS and ELISA assay indicated P 2 to be the dominant linear antigenic domain, with the immunogenic potency to protect the majority of chickens from NDV challenge. In contrast, the P 1, P 3 and P 4 domains showed weak antigenicity in vivo and could not protect chickens from NDV challenge. These results provide important insight into the characteristic of humoral immune responses elicited by HN of NDV in vivo...|$|R
40|$|An in vivo {{expression}} technology (IVET) {{system was}} previously developed {{and used to}} identify Pasteurella multocida genes, which are upregulated during infection of the host. Of the many genes identified, two encoded products which showed similarity to the Haemophilus influenzae lipoproteins, protein D and PCP, which {{have been shown to}} stimulate heterologous immunity against infection with H. influenzae. Therefore, the lipoprotein homologues in P. multocida, designated GlpQ and PCP, were investigated. GlpQ and PCP were shown to be lipoproteins by demonstrating that post-translational processing of the proteins was inhibited by globomycin. The P. multocida GlpQ homologue showed glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase enzyme activity, indicating that it is a functional homologue of other characterized GlpQ enzymes. Using surface immunoprecipitation, PCP was found to be surface exposed, but GlpQ was not. Non-lipidated forms of GlpQ and PCP were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli and used to vaccinate mice. However, mice were not protected from challenge with live P. multocida. The lipoproteins were then expressed in E. coli in the lipidated form and used to vaccinate mice and <b>chickens.</b> <b>Protection</b> against challenge with live P. multocida was not observed...|$|R

We previously showed that in broiler <b>chickens</b> <b>protection</b> against NE can be achieved through intramuscular immunization with alpha toxin (AT) and hypothetical protein (HP), and we subsequently identified B-cell epitopes in HP. In the present study, we identified B-cell epitopes in AT recognized by chickens immune to NE. The gene fragments encoding immunodominant epitopes of AT {{as well as those}} of HP were codon optimized for Salmonella and cloned into pYA 3493, and the resultant plasmid constructs were introduced into an attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium χ 9352 vaccine vehicle. The expression of these Clostridium perfringens proteins, alpha toxoid (ATd) and truncated HP (HPt), was confirmed by immunoblotting. The <b>protection</b> of broiler <b>chickens</b> against experimentally induced NE was assessed at both the moderate and the severe levels of challenge. Birds immunized orally with Salmonella expressing ATd were significantly protected against moderate NE, and there was a nonsignificant trend for protection against severe challenge, whereas HPt-immunized birds were significantly protected against both severities of challenge. Immunized birds developed serum IgY and mucosal IgA and IgY antibody responses against Clostridium and Salmonella antigens. In conclusion, this study identified, for the first time, the B-cell epitopes in AT from an NE isolate recognized by chickens and showed the partial protective ability of codon-optimized ATd and HPt against NE in broiler chickens when they were delivered orally by using a Salmonella vaccine vehicle...|$|R

In order to compare the effects of inserted genes in the two sites on {{the efficacy of the}} recombinant vaccines, host-protective haemagglutinin (HA) gene of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H 5 N 1 was inserted into either US 2 or US 10 gene locus of the HVT. The resulting US 2 (rHVT-US 2 -HA) or US 10 (rHVT-US 10 -HA) recombinant HVT viruses were used to infect chicken embryo fibroblasts. Plaques and the growth kinetics of rHVT-US 2 -HA-infected chicken embryo fibroblasts were similar to those of parental HVT whereas rHVT-US 10 -HA infected chicken embryo fibroblasts had different growth kinetics and plaque formation. The viremia levels in rHVT-US 10 -HA virus-infected chickens were significantly lower than those of rHVT-US 2 -HA group on 28 days post infection. The vaccine efficacy of the two recombinant viruses against H 5 N 1 HPAIV and virulent Marek’s disease virus was also evaluated in 1 -dayold vaccinated chickens. rHVT-US 2 -HA-vaccinated chickens were better protected with reduced mortality than rHVT-US 10 -HA-vaccinated animals following HPAIV challenge.

40|$|Sustained {{outbreaks}} of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H 5 N 1 in avian species {{increase the risk}} of reassortment and adaptation to humans. The ability to contain its spread in chickens would reduce this threat and help maintain the capacity for egg-based vaccine production. While vaccines offer the potential to control avian disease, a major concern of current vaccines is their potency and inability to protect against evolving avian influenza viruses. The ability of DNA vaccines encoding hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from different HPAI H 5 N 1 serotypes was evaluated for its ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies and to protect against homologous and heterologous HPAI H 5 N 1 strain challenge in mice and chickens after DNA immunization by needle and syringe or with a pressure injection device. These vaccines elicited antibodies that neutralized multiple strains of HPAI H 5 N 1 when given in combinations containing up to 10 HAs. The response was dose-dependent, and breadth was determined by the choice of the influenza virus HA in the vaccine. Monovalent and trivalent HA vaccines were tested first in mice and conferred protection against lethal H 5 N 1 A/Vietnam/ 1203 / 2004 challenge 68 weeks after vaccination. In <b>chickens,</b> <b>protection</b> was observed against heterologous strains of HPAI H 5 N 1 after vaccination with a trivalent H 5 serotype DNA vaccine with doses as low as 5 microg DNA given twice either by intramuscular needle injection or with a needle-free device.

40|$|Abstract Background Infectious {{bronchitis}} {{is highly}} contagious and constitutes {{one of the}} most common and difficult poultry diseases to control. IBV is endemic in probably all countries that raise chickens. It exists as dozens of serotypes/genotypes. Only a few amino acid differences in the S 1 protein of vaccine and challenge strains of IBV may result in poor protection. Tropism of IBV includes the respiratory tract tissues, proventriculus and caecal tonsils of the alimentary tract, the oviduct and the kidney. Results Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain closely related to Massachusetts (Mass) serotype was isolated from broiler chickens suffering from severe renal and respiratory distresses. The isolate was serologically identified by Dot-ELISA and further characterized by RT-PCR then genotyped using S 1 gene sequence analysis. Alignment of the S 1 sequence of the isolate with 16 IBV strains revealed high homology to isolates related to Mass serotype. Inoculation with the strain reproduced the disease in experimental 1 -day-old chickens and resulted in 20 % mortality, severe renal and moderate respiratory distresses. Marked histopathological changes in both kidney and trachea were observed in experimentally infected <b>chickens.</b> A <b>protection</b> study using the H 120 live attenuated vaccine showed low protection rate in spite of high S 1 sequence homology (97 %). Protection based criteria were: virus re-isolation attempts from trachea, tracheal and renal histopathology as well as IBV antigens detection by immunofluorescent antibody technique in kidney sections. Conclusion Periodical evaluation of cross-protective capabilities of IBV vaccine(s) versus recently recovered field isolates should be performed to ensure optimum control of IBV. </p...|$|R

Salmonella serovars which are able to cause disease in animal or domestic animal are limited, such as: S. pullorum and S. gallinarum which are well adapted to poultry, cause fowl typhoid, S. cholerasuis causes disease in swine. S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis can infect all animals and humans. S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis could be isolated from salmonellosis of poultry, meat, milk and eggs. The prevalence of those isolates within {{the last two decades}} tends to increase. Pathogenic Salmonella serovars can infect both animals and humans, colonize the intestinal epithelial cells lead to diarrhoea. Salmonella spp. may enter the lower layer of epithelial cells and the lymphoid vascular system. Humoral antibody and cell mediated immunity responses may develop. Extraintestinal shedding or dissemination of Salmonella spp. may occur and multiply, this may cause latent infections and spread to the environment. Serologic diagnosis of infected animals can be done by means of serum or whole blood agglutination tests with whole cell antigen or ELISA with LPS coated tray, might demonstrate cross reactions among serovars within the one group. ELISA antibody by using fimbrial SEF 14 antigen demonstrated specific diagnosis of S. enteritidis infection. The use of S. enteritidis inactive vaccines stimulates high humoral antibody response and protection against challenged homologous serovar within one group (D).

Virchow colonised the gastrointestinal tract and the spleen. Infection elicited an increase in specific IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies and relative quantitative changes in several leukocyte populations, including CD 3, CD 4, CD 8 α, CD 8 β, MHC II, KuL 01 and γδ TCR positive cells, both in the gastrointestinal tract and systemically. Increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 1 β and IL- 6 and the chemokine CXCLi 2 was also found. Primary infection with S. Virchow offered limited systemic protection against re-challenge with S. Virchow or S. Typhimurium, but no protection against caecal colonisation. In conclusion, S.

40|$|AbstractHighly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} viruses (HPAIVs) cause huge economic {{losses in the}} poultry industry because of high mortality rate in infected flocks and trade restrictions. Protective antibodies, directed mainly against hemagglutinin (HA), are the primary means of protection against influenza outbreaks. A recombinant DNA vaccine based on the sequence of H 5 HA from the H 5 N 1 /A/swan/Poland/ 305 - 135 V 08 / 2006 strain of HPAIV was prepared. Sequence manipulation included deletion of the proteolytic cleavage site to improve protein stability, codon usage optimization to improve translation and stability of RNA in host cells, and cloning into a commercially available vector to enable expression in animal cells. Naked plasmid DNA was complexed with a liposomal carrier and the immunization followed the prime–boost strategy. The immunogenic potential of the DNA vaccine was first proved in broilers in near-to-field conditions resembling a commercial farm. Next, the protective activity of the vaccine was confirmed in SPF layer-type chickens. Experimental infections (challenge experiments) indicated that 100 % of vaccinated chickens were protected against H 5 N 1 of the same clade and that 70 % of them were protected against H 5 N 1 influenza virus of a different clade. Moreover, the DNA vaccine significantly limited (or even eliminated) transmission of the virus to contact control chickens.

Overall, five isolated viral polypeptides/proteins upon characterization were used to prepare hyperimmune monovalent serum against respective polypeptides independently and a mixture of all five in poultry birds, and specificity confirmation of each antiserum through dot blot and Western blotting. Antiserum generated from various group birds was pooled and evaluated in 2 -week old broiler <b>chicken,</b> for its <b>protection</b> against viral challenge. To evaluate in-vivo protection of each antiserum against viral challenges, six groups of 2 -week old broiler chicken were injected with antiserum and a seventh control group received normal saline. Each group was exposed to purified highly pathogenic AIV H 7 N 3 strain at a dose 105 embryo lethal dose (ELD 50). We observed that nucleoprotein (NP) antiserum significantly protected birds from viral infection induced morbidity, mortality and lowered viral shedding compared with antiserum from individual viral proteins or mixed polypeptides/proteins inclusive of NP component. The capability of individual viral polypeptide specific antisera to protect against viral challenges in decreasing order was nucleoprotein (NP) > hemagglutinin (HA) > neuraminidase (NA) > viral proteins mix > viral polymerase (PM) > non-structural proteins (NS). Our data provide proof of concept for potential utilization of passive immunization in protecting poultry industry during infection outbreaks. Furthermore conserved nature of avian NP makes it an ideal candidate to produce antiserum protective against viral infection...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant fowlpox virus (rFPV/HN) expressing Newcastle disease virus (NDV) HN {{gene and}} rFPV/HN/chIL- 12 co-expressing chicken IL- 12 (chIL- 12) and HN (rHN/chIL- 12) genes have been characterized. rHN/chIL- 12 or rchIL- 12, {{expressed}} by our previous construct rFPV/chIL- 12, co-administered with rHN was assessed for adjuvant activities of chIL- 12. Chickens were vaccinated with various amounts of rHN/chIL- 12 mixed with mineral oil (MO), intramuscularly. Levels of hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody production {{depended on the}} concentration of the injected rHN or rHN/chIL- 12. The lower HI antibody titers were obtained in chicken groups rHN/chIL- 12 / 7 -rHN/chIL- 12 / 9, receiving 60 ng rHN/ 8 ng chIL- 12 with MO, 30 ng rHN/ 4 ng chIL- 12 with MO or 15 ng rHN/ 2 ng chIL- 12 with MO, respectively, compared to those in chicken groups rHN/ 7 -rHN/ 9, receiving rHN with MO alone. However, chickens in group rHN/chIL- 12 / 7 or rHN/chIL- 12 / 8 and rHN with MO alone showed the same effective <b>protection.</b> <b>Chicken</b> group rHN/chIL- 12 / 9 was even more protective than that in group rHN/ 9. When rchIL- 12 was co-injected with 15 ng rHN plus MO, chickens produced low levels of HI antibody titers; while higher levels of IFN-gamma production and an effective protection rate (83 %) were obtained. On the other hand, low levels of IFN-gamma production and low protection response (50 %) were obtained in chickens injected with rHN with MO alone. Taken together, when the concentration of rHN decreased to certain levels, rchIL- 12 reduced HI antibody production. The increase in the induction of IFN-gamma production might suggest the enhancement of the cell-mediated immunity which conferred the protection from the NDV challenge. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
