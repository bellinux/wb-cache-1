40|$|ABSTRACT: Four {{hundred and}} eight siblings, par-ents, and {{grandparents}} of seventy-eight {{children from the}} New England area who had <b>congenital</b> <b>dysplasia</b> of the hip were evaluated, by clinical examination and by measurements of the acetabulum on pelvic radiographs, for the signs and sequelae of <b>congenital</b> <b>dysplasia</b> of the hip.

The other ninety-one siblings were asymptomatic and had no ra-diographic evidence of dysplasia of the hip. In the adults in these families, acetabular coverage (as measured by the center-edge angle of Wiberg) was no different from that in the control subjects.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of total hip replacement patients requires objective criteria {{that allow for}} the measurement of any changes in the biomechanics of the prosthesis {{and the effects of}} these changes on clinical findings.

In this study 15 patients who had undergone total hip replacement for coxarthrosis primary or secondary to <b>congenital</b> <b>dysplasia</b> were examined by kinematic and kinetic gait analysis, clinical evaluation, and radiographic evaluation of the position of the neocenter of prosthetic joint rotation. The patients with prostheses in <b>congenital</b> <b>dysplasia</b> presented with a pattern of walking that was significantly modified.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} titled: Sister {{in care of}} a child with <b>congenital</b> <b>dysplasia</b> of the hip joint. The aim of this work is to map the care {{of a child with}} <b>congenital</b> <b>dysplasia</b> of the hip joint, {{including}} the historical view, {{and the role of the}} nurse in this subject. The thesis presents the disease from the very beginning in the mother's body, after its development, diagnosis to the development of the treatment to the present time. The aim of the thesis is to introduce the reader with the history of this defect of the locomotory system and provide a summary of available information. Emphasis is placed on advancing conservative treatment and on nursing care in a hospital for a child with <b>congenital</b> <b>dysplasia.</b> The work is enriched with information from a doctor - ortopedic, nursing nurse and orthopedic nurses. In terms of methodology, methods of explanation, synthesis and induction are used. These methods consist of a summary and a combination of collected primary information and are focused on the logical reconstruction of the explanation and understanding of the topic. The sources are drawn from the Medvik, PuBMed, and Ebsco web sites, which provide me with an overview of sources written in czech, english and german language. It is also drawn from the findings of the Medical Museum in Prague, where I got to the primary source from 1895.

40|$|Isolated <b>congenital</b> nail <b>dysplasia</b> is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder recently {{observed in a}} large family from southern Germany. The disorder is characterized by longitudinal streaks, thinning, and impaired formation of the nail plates leading to increased vulnerability of the free nail margins. In most cases, all fingernails and toenails are similarly involved with some accentuation of the thumb and great toenails. Histologic changes include hypergranulosis of the nail matrix and epithelial outgrowths from the nail bed. Patients do not show any alterations of hair growth and dentition, no malfunction of sweat glands and sensory organs, and no skeletal abnormalities. Isolated <b>congenital</b> nail <b>dysplasia</b> manifests from {{the first year of}} life with variable expressivity. In order to localize chromosomally the gene underlying isolated <b>congenital</b> nail <b>dysplasia,</b> linkage to the known keratin gene cluster regions on chromosomes 12 q 12 and 17 q 21 was ruled out first. The analysis of 150 microsatellite markers on various chromosomes mapped the isolated <b>congenital</b> nail <b>dysplasia</b> gene to the 6 [*]cM interval between markers at D 17 S 926 and D 17 S 1528 on chromosome 17 p 13. Markers at D 17 S 849, D 17 S 1840, and D 17 S 1529 co-segregated completely with the isolated <b>congenital</b> nail <b>dysplasia</b> locus. The maximum two-point LOD score was found for the marker at D 17 S 1840 (Zmax[*]=[*] 6. 72 at Θmax[*]=[*] 0. 00). The identified region harbors no currently known genes involved in skin or nail abnormalities. Isolated <b>congenital</b> nail <b>dysplasia</b> probably represents a novel isolated defect of nail development.

40|$|Objective - Describe {{a case of}} <b>congenital</b> acinar <b>dysplasia</b> {{and review}} the {{literature}}. Study Design - Retrospective chart review and literature search. Results - <b>Congenital</b> acinar <b>dysplasia</b> is a rare malformation of growth arrest of the lower respiratory tract resulting in critical respiratory insufficiency at birth. It {{is a form of}} pulmonary hypoplasia that is characterized by diffuse maldevelopment and derangement of the acinar and alveolar architecture of the lungs, resulting in the complete absence of gas exchanging units. The growth-arrested lung tissue resembles the pseudoglandular phase of 16 weeks' gestation. The etiology is unknown. It is diagnosed by exclusion of all other causes of pulmonary hypoplasia and a summation of clinical, imaging, and histopathologic findings. Conclusion - There is no cure and clinical treatment is supportive until death of the infant.

40|$|Objective　To {{investigate}} {{the development of}} vertebral artery in the 2010 enrolled pilot cadets, and provide a foundation for introducing vertebral artery ultrasound examination into inclusion criteria. Methods　The ultrasound findings of the vertebral artery in 722 pilot cadets, including its origin, shape, diameter and hemodynamic patterns, were retrospectively reviewed by two-dimensional and color Doppler ultrasound. The proportion of its <b>congenital</b> <b>dysplasia</b> was calculated and summarized. Results　Among the 722 pilot cadets, both the inner diameter of the initial segment (D 1) and the intervertebral segment (D 2) of left vertebral artery were wider than the right one (3. 624 ± 0. 017 mm vs 3. 489 ± 0. 018 mm, 3. 623 ± 0. 018 mm vs 3. 438 ± 0. 019 mm, P 0. 05). Among 5 persons showed both abnormal origin and shape, there were 2 cases in whom there was also small caliber.

40|$|Total hip {{arthroplasty}} in degenerative pathology {{secondary to}} <b>congenital</b> <b>dysplasia</b> differentiates itself amongtotal arthroplasties by the frequent technical difficulties it poses {{and the site}} where it is performed. The existence of aform of <b>congenital</b> <b>dysplasia</b> that remained untreated or insufficiently treated in childhood leads to irreversibledeformities in adulthood. Partial or total loss of joint congruence causes, in time, degenerative changes with theimpairment of hip mobility and {{is associated with a}} number of progressive deformations (limb length discrepancy,abnormal rotation, asymmetric lesions, periarticular muscle failure), which gradually reduce the quality of the patient’slife. This study aims at investigating the incidence of prosthetic hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis secondary todysplastic hip in the total number of arthroplasties, the age when surgery is performed, the type of deformity andprosthetic components used, and the postoperative and long-term functional results. The study was conducted on 110 patients who received total hip arthroplasty due to osteoarthritis secondary to hip dysplasia, between 1994 and 2011, inthe Orthopaedics Trauma Department of the Rehabilitation Hospital of Iasi, the incidence being of 3. 34 % of the totalnumber of arthroplasties, with a prevalence of 65 % under the age of 50 years.
