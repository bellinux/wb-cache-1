5|$|After {{purchasing}} a drum set and acquiring a piano from Joey's mother, Jimmy secures {{the remainder of}} the band's musical equipment from Duffy, a black market dealer. The band rehearses on the second floor above a snooker hall, and after much practice, they <b>convince</b> <b>a</b> local church community centre to give them a gig, under the pretence of it being an anti-heroin campaign. Jimmy then hires Mickah Wallace, a hot-tempered bouncer, to act as the band's security. The band draws a good crowd, but after Deco inadvertently hits Derek with his microphone stand, the amplifiers explode, resulting in a power outage.|$|E
5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't <b>convince</b> <b>a</b> fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E
5|$|Later that evening, Jiminy and {{his parents}} <b>convince</b> <b>a</b> couple {{to give up some}} goods in {{exchange}} for a tonic that will supposedly make them immune to a plague. He soon discovers that his father switched Rumpelstiltskin's tonic with the one they sold, and finds that the couple have been turned into dolls. Even worse, he then discovers that the couple were the parents of the young boy he spoke to earlier. Having realized what he has done, Jiminy makes a wish and receives an answer from The Blue Fairy, who shows up to give him his one true wish: becoming a cricket. Jiminy is also told that {{he has a chance to}} help someone in the future, starting with the young boy, who would grow up to be Gepetto. As for the cursed dolls, they end up as a collection at Mr. Gold's (Carlyle) pawn shop.|$|E

5|$|The Jakarta Post was {{the brainchild}} of Information Minister Ali Murtopo and {{politician}} Jusuf Wanandi. Murtopo and Wanandi were disappointed at the perceived bias against Indonesia in foreign news sources. At the time, there were two English-language dailies, The Indonesia Times and The Indonesian Observer. However, due to negative public perception regarding the existing papers they decided to create a new one. In order to ensure credibility, the two agreed to <b>convince</b> <b>a</b> group of competing newspapers (the Golkar-backed Suara Karya, the Catholic-owned Kompas, the Protestant-owned Sinar Harapan, and the weekly Tempo) to back the nascent paper. It was hoped to become a quality English-language paper, similar to The Straits Times in Singapore, the Bangkok Post in Thailand, and the New Straits Times in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of forensic {{science and the}} ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva, or hair has led to re-examining many cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was scientifically impossible {{at the time of the}} original examination. Combined with the removal of the double jeopardy law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened where prior trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to <b>convince</b> <b>a</b> jury. People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defense to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that cross-contamination of evidence has occurred. This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime.|$|E
5|$|The first popular {{rock music}} bootleg {{resulted}} from Bob Dylan's activities between largely disappearing {{from the public}} eye after his motorcycle accident in 1966, {{and the release of}} John Wesley Harding at the end of 1967. After a number of artists had hits with Dylan songs that he had not officially recorded and released himself, demand increased for these recordings, particularly when they started airing on local radio in Los Angeles. Through various contacts in the radio industry, a number of pioneering bootleggers managed to buy a reel to reel tape containing a selection of unreleased Dylan songs intended for distribution for music publishers and wondered if {{it would be possible to}} manufacture them on an LP. They managed to <b>convince</b> <b>a</b> local pressing plant to press between 1,000 and 2,000 copies discreetly, paying in cash and avoiding using real names or addresses. Since the bootleggers could not commercially print a sleeve, due to it attracting too much attention from recording companies, the LP was issued in a plain white cover with Great White Wonder rubber stamped on it. Subsequently, Dylan became one of the most popular artists to be bootlegged with numerous releases.|$|E

25|$|Git version 2.6.1, {{released}} on 29 September 2015, contained a patch for a security vulnerability (CVE-2015-7545) which allowed arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability was exploitable if an attacker could <b>convince</b> <b>a</b> victim to clone a specific URL, as the arbitrary commands were {{embedded in the}} URL itself. An attacker could use the exploit via a man-in-the-middle attack if the connection was unencrypted, as they could redirect the user to a URL of their choice. Recursive clones were also vulnerable, since they allowed the controller of a repository to specify arbitrary URLs via the gitmodules file.|$|E

The man he was attempting to sway signaled to him from the floor of the hall, and Stephens followed him downstairs.
