50|$|Parnis uses 316L {{military}} grade stainless steel cases made with conventional machine processes instead of metal injection molding. As a result, Parnis cases have the tensile strength of <b>competitive</b> <b>watch</b> brands. For example, only Rolex exceeds the 316L standard with {{its use of}} 904 grade stainless steel. Rolex's closest competitor, Omega, uses 316L {{military grade}} stainless steel. A majority of stainless steel watches follow the 304 standard, which are anti-magnetic, but lack the tensile strength required for use in high pressure environments.|$|E

Ron Wallace, {{general manager}} of Palides, {{explained}} the difference between mother and daughter in a 2011 interview: [...] "(Delta Princess) is tough; she's a lot more competitive than Royal Delta. But Royal Delta is way more athletic and she hasn't even quite figured it all out. She {{is going to be}} incredible as a 4-year-old. She was laid back in the paddock (before racing in the 2011 Ladies' Classic). Here (at the Keeneland Sales), she's a star, but she doesn't care. Her mother would eat horses alive in front of her; she was going to win no matter what. Royal Delta is just good (because of her natural ability). If she learns to be <b>competitive,</b> <b>watch</b> out." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{completely}} revised {{second edition}} of Lemurs of Madagascar was reviewed {{in detail in}} the American Journal of Primatology by Stacey Tecot. Each chapter, section, and appendix was thoroughly summarized, and as with the reviews of previous editions, the chapter on subfossil lemurs was noted {{as one of the}} more [...] "fascinating" [...] parts of the book, particularly due to its colorful and informative illustrations. Although the book received only praise, Tecot did suggest two additions for the next edition: the need for information about the processes of island biogeography and expansion on captive conservation programs aside from the Duke Lemur Center, particularly at the Lemur Conservation Foundation and St. Catherines Island. A subject index was also recommended, along with better referencing of the figures and illustrations. Otherwise, the book was praised as being better than other field guides due to its inclusion of seemingly obscure yet important details, such as how to get to lemur watching sites, travel time, where to stay, mentions of lesser-known sites, listings of species to be seen, best times to observe, and even, among other things, the number of habituated lemur groups in each area. Tecot noted that the lemur checklist promoted <b>competitive</b> lemur <b>watching,</b> similar to birdwatching, and that the color-coded sections assisted in [...] "on-the-fly species identification." [...] Although very satisfied with the information provided for each species, Tecot commended the promise made in this edition to more extensively cover the published literature in the upcoming third edition. Like its predecessor, the second edition was praised as an excellent tool for ecotourists and researchers. It was also noted for its attempt to promote ecotourism as a conservation strategy.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that many adults, {{including}} those who have had formal instruction in biology, hold pervasive misconceptions about evolution by natural selection. While one possible source of misunderstanding is the devaluation of within-species variation (Shtulman 2 ÃÜ 6 Schulz, 2008), another possible source is the misperception of nature. The processes supporting evolution are factors that drive interactions among animals of the same species as well as between animals of different species. Thus, misperceptions of such interactions, such as the underestimation of within- or between-species competition or the overestimation of cooperative behaviors, may impede learning. The current study investigates students 2 ÃÜ 7 perceptions of nature and how these perceptions are related to a correct understanding of evolution. We also investigate the malleability of these perceptions through exposure to direct, visual evidence of cooperative or competitive behaviors in nature. Thirty-two college undergraduates estimated the frequency of specific cooperative and <b>competitive</b> behaviors after <b>watching</b> clips of one of these types of behaviors from nature documentaries. In addition, they completed various assessments of their evolution understanding. Preliminary findings indicate that, across conditions, participants perceived animals as exhibiting cooperative, intra-species behaviors more frequently than any other type of behavior, perhaps suggesting a bias toward a benevolent view of nature. Exposure to clips of cooperative behavior also seemed to prime participants to perceive cooperative behaviors as more frequent than otherwise, but had no effects on perceptions of competitive behavior. Such malleability of perception may be valuable to science education, as an aid to correcting commonly-held misconceptions...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} different pre-match motivational interventions on athlete free testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) concentrations and subsequent match performance in professional rugby union. Male participants (n = 12) playing at a senior or academy level in rugby union were recruited and each completed three interventions (15. min each) before a <b>competitive</b> game; 1) <b>watching</b> a video clip of successful skill execution by the player with positive coach feedback [VPCF 1]; 2) watching a video clip of successful skill execution by an opposing player with cautionary coach feedback [VCCF], 3) the player left alone to self-motivate [SM 1]. The first and last interventions were retested [VPCF 2 and SM 2]. Salivary free T and C measures were taken pre-intervention and pre-game. Within each game, players were rated by coaching staff on a key performance indicator (KPI) from identified skills and an overall performance indicator (OPI), where 1 = best performance to 5 = worst performance. The VPCF 1 and VPCF 2 interventions both promoted significant T responses (11. 8 % to 12. 5 %) before each game and more so than SM 1, SM 2 and VCCF. The VCCF approach produced the largest C response (17. 6 %) and this differed from all other treatments. The VPCF interventions were also associated with better game KPI (1. 5 to 1. 8) and OPI ratings (1. 7 to 1. 8) than SM 1, SM 2 and/or VCCF. Across all treatments, greater individual T responses and lower C responses were associated with better KPI and OPI outcomes. In conclusion, the pre-game presentation of motivational strategies to athletes involving specific video footage and coach feedback produced different outcomes on two indicators of match performance, which were also associated with changes in free hormonal state...|$|R
