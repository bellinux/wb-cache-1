5000|$|Gotye {{discussed}} writing [...] "Somebody That I Used to Know" [...] in {{an interview}} with Sound on Sound: [...] "Writing 'Somebody' was a gradual and linear process. I started with the Luiz Bonfa sample, then I found the drums, and after that I started working on the lyric and the melody, and added the wobbly guitar-sample melody. After that, I took a break, and a few weeks later I came back to the session and decided on the chorus chord progression, wrote the chorus melody, and combined that with sounds like the Latin loop and some of the percussion and the flute sounds that further filled the space. At that point I hit a brick wall. I was thinking: 'This is pretty good, how can I get to the end really quickly?' and I was trying to take lazy decisions to finish the song. I considered repeating the chorus, an instrumental bridge, a change in tempo or key, I even considered finishing the song after the first chorus. But nothing felt like it was strong enough. So the third session was all about writing the female part and changing the perspective. The arrangement of 'Somebody' is reflective of me moving towards using sounds that provide me with inspiration for a texture or a platform for an idea, and then through sonic manipulation and coming up with original melodies and harmonic ideas to make it my own. I guess the balance of sounds taken from records and samples I <b>created</b> <b>myself</b> is perhaps 50-50." [...] "Somebody That I Used to Know" [...] is an art pop song and has a length of four minutes and five seconds long. [...] Gotye uses a sample of Brazilian jazz guitarist Luiz Bonfá's 1967 instrumental song [...] "Seville", with additional instrumentations of beats and a xylophone. It was written and produced by Gotye himself, while in his parents' barn on the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria. Gotye commented that he wrote the song [...] "in quite a linear way", explaining that [...] "I wrote the first verse, the second verse, and I'd got {{to the end of the}} first chorus and for the first time ever I thought, 'There's no interesting way to add to this guy's story'. It felt weak".|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is {{presented}} to demonstrate {{the fact that the}} working classes significantly affects the development of fine and gross motor skills of students with mild mental disabilities. Work is also devoted to working techniques when working with paper in the working hours of teaching elementary school. In the first chapter generally defined mild mental retardation, and characterize its main features. In the second chapter specifies the student's personality with mild mental disabilities of school age. The third chapter is devoted to the educational program for primary school in teaching the course work. Following part of the thesis are focused on specific business and technology topics that affect the development of gross and fine motor skills. Some of the topics that are presented here, I <b>created</b> <b>myself,</b> others I drew from literature. The conclusion is devoted to case studies that converge on the issue of students with mild degree of mental disability in the working hours of teaching. These findings and conclusions based on his own observations and experience gained in teaching activities. Aim of this thesis was chosen to describe the techniques and specific examples then demonstrate how to use them, including descriptions of specific areas to which the development of the techniques for students [...] ...|$|E

The necessary data for this empirical research will be obtained {{on the basis of}} the questionnaires distributed among 30 active athletes and 30 pacients of prof.

40|$|In this essay, I discuss {{one of the}} {{recurring}} dilemmas for a working recreational pedagogue, namely the hard task of cooperation with parents. As a recreational pedagogue, I am required to work by the curriculum Läroplan för grundskolan, förskoleklassen och fritidshemmet 2011. This policy document talks about what my responsibilities are, including establishing collaboration with parents {{in terms of the}} children’s development and education. It happens, however, that the pedagogue and the parent's ethical positions differ. When norms collide, it is my responsibility as a recreational pedagogue to relate to the different norms in a professional manner. In this essay I argue that, one of the main characteristics of a competent pedagogue is the ability to meet various parents with their respective backgrounds, to be able to interpret the individuals and meet them in an encouraging way for the children's development. Personal identity today is multiple, as an individual, I have <b>created</b> <b>myself</b> a number of identities which apply at different times. At home, I'm a mother, at family dinners; I am a daughter, sister and granddaughter. At university, I am a student and at my workplace, I am recreational pedagogue. Thus, I am not only my profession but also a human with my own experiences, interpretations and feelings. From them I act. In this essay, I draw on my own experiences where my view of ethics and upbringing is different from a parent's sight. In essay writing, I reflect on my actions in the events with the help of various ethical theories and the intercultural approach. Through my writing, I have been given a chance to pause and reflect on my own behavior in situations where I meet parents of other opinions than my own. How can I act differently and more professionally in these meetings in the future...|$|E

40|$|This essay {{examines}} {{the problem of}} medial specificity in music and sound art, giving particular attention to Seth Kim-Cohen’s call for a non-cochlear sound art based {{on the notion of}} “expansion” that has been decisive in visual arts discourses. I argue that Kim-Cohen’s non-cochlear intervention in In the Blink of an Ear might be productively pressured towards the concept of a “sonic effect” that acknowledges the material-discursive particularity of sound without recourse to the phenomenological claims of authenticity that Kim-Cohen correctly abhors. In service of this argument, the essay extensively discusses a sound and media artwork – Exurbia, <b>created</b> by <b>myself</b> and William Brent – that leverages the metaphorics of sound against existing understandings of specific forms of network communication. I argue that the conceptual and material dimensions of the project stridulate in a hum of recursive vectors for considering the constitution and consequences of networked aural interaction. Exurbia can thus be parsed in terms of medial specificity precisely because its digital aural materials are themselves discursive...|$|R
