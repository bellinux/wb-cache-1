On March 21, 1900, Nikola Tesla {{was granted a}} US patent for the means for increasing the intensity of electrical oscillations by lowering the temperature, which was caused by lowered resistance. Within this patent it describes the increased intensity and duration of electric oscillations of a low temperature resonating circuit.

2500|$|Clarity {{can also}} be [...] "enhanced" [...] by filling the {{fracture}} much like a car windshield crack can be treated. Such diamonds are sometimes called [...] "fracture filled diamonds". Reputable vendors must disclose this filling and reputable filling companies use filling agents which show a flash of color, commonly orange or pink, when viewed closely. There is a significant price discount for fracture-filled diamonds. The GIA will not grade fracture-filled diamonds, {{in part because the}} treatment is not as permanent as the diamond itself. Reputable companies often provide for repeat treatments if heat causes damage to the filling. The heat required to cause damage is that of a blowtorch used to work on settings, and it is essential to inform anyone working on a setting if the diamond is fracture-filled, so they can apply <b>cooling</b> <b>agents</b> to the diamond and use greater care while working on it.|$|E
2500|$|Rooh Afza ( [...] ; [...] ) is a non-alcoholic {{concentrated}} squash.

The specific Unani recipe of Rooh Afza combines several ingredients popularly believed to be <b>cooling</b> <b>agents,</b> such as rose, which is used as a remedy for loo (the hot summer winds of Northern India and Pakistan and Bangladesh). The drink is commonly associated with the month of Ramadan, in which it is usually consumed during iftar.

50|$|The {{transformer}} is cooled by a <b>cooling</b> <b>agent</b> {{made of a}} polyol-ester mix, {{which is}} recirculated by two independent canned motor pumps; these pumps make the occurrence of leaks almost impossible. Each pump can be sealed off separately, and can therefore be easily replaced. In cases where one pump fails, the <b>cooling</b> <b>agent</b> remains in the transformer tank; the transformer is capable of providing power at 65% of full capacity with just one pump in operation.|$|R

The CO2 system can keep the cargo frozen solid as long as 14 to 16 days.|$|R
50|$|Motor oil {{may also}} serve as a <b>cooling</b> <b>agent.</b> In some constructions oil is sprayed through a nozzle inside the {{crankcase}} onto the piston to provide cooling of specific parts that undergo high temperature strain. On the other hand, the thermal capacity of the oil pool has to be filled, i.e. the oil has to reach its designed temperature range before it can protect the engine under high load. This typically takes longer than heating the main <b>cooling</b> <b>agent</b> — water or mixtures thereof — up to its operating temperature. In order to inform the driver about the oil temperature, some older and most high-performance or racing engines feature an oil thermometer.|$|R

50|$|Evaporative cooling vests are {{typically}} submersed {{in water for}} around 3 - 5 minutes and lightly wrung out or blot dried.

They are light weight, easy to use and no electricity is required making them perfect for people on the move. They are also the most affordable form of cooling vest.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{allegedly}} discriminatory {{employment regulations}} in France, many Romani find {{it impossible to}} gain formal employment. As a result, many have turned to clandestine recycling operations of e-waste in slums outside large French cities. At these sites, e-waste is broken into various types of metals, such as aluminum, copper, iron, and lead. Copper is extracted from cables by burning them in open fires, while car batteries are melted down for lead and refrigerators are sent through car crushers without removing <b>cooling</b> <b>agents,</b> which can release up to four tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere per unit.|$|E

5000|$|Due to the dangerous, and {{potentially}} fatal, {{effects of the}} loo on vegetation, humans and animals, [...] it is {{sometimes referred to as}} an evil wind in popular Indo-Pakistani culture. Avoiding exposure to the Loo is strongly recommended for children and the elderly, as well as pets. Most people attempt to stay indoors as much as possible during afternoons in the Loo-affected months. Heatstrokes are commonly referred to as Loo lagna (Hindi: लू लगना, Urdu: لُو لگنا) being stricken by the Loo [...] Certain sherbets, which are popularly believed to have a cooling effect on the body and provide some protection against Loo-caused heatstrokes, are widely consumed during the Loo-season. These include sherbets of rose, khus, shahtoot, bel and phalsa. A specific Unani recipe called Rooh Afza combines several of these popularly believed <b>cooling</b> <b>agents,</b> and is sold commercially as a syrup to flavor sherbets, cold milk drinks, ices and cold desserts, such as the popular falooda. Lassi, a yogurt-based drink of North India and Pakistan, is also extremely popular and believed to confer some protection against the Loo.

The effect of these variables was determined using two calibrated, multi-channel temperature logging systems.
