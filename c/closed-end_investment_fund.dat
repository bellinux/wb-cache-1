40|$|Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> is an {{alternative}} means of investment in the capital market and absolutely prospective for the public. But, {{for the last three}} years its activity is more dominated by the rapid growth and development of the so-called open-end collective investment agreement than the <b>closed-end</b> Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> taking the form of limited liability company, particularly among the Investment Manager as players in the capital market. On the other side, Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> is also purported to be a collective investment means which is favouring domestic investors, particularly small and medium investors that need both certainty and protection of their investment. What is reflected is that there are some legal aspects in the Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> activity, mostly on the side of the Investment Manager as a company providing management service for securities portfolio or investment of its customers. Therefore, it is important to conduct research on these legal aspects to reveal the reasons why [...] particularly among the Investment Manager [...] open-end Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> is more developed than its closed-end counterpart. It is also necessary to conduct research on the institutional character and the activities of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> as a business construction, the control of the government over the activities of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> to ensure protection of the public investors interest, and the system of responsibility of the Investment Manager to the investors in Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund.</b> In order to identify and to understand the above mentioned problems, this descriptive-analytical research is performed through juridical-normative and sociological approach by focusing on secondary data which is supported by primary data. Data of this research is gathered from BAPEPAM, some Investment Managers, some Representatives of Investment Manager, APEI (Indonesian Association of Securities Companies), and PIPM Semarang. In gathering data, the techniques employed in this research are document analysis, questionaire, and interview. Next, qualitative analysis is applied to the data gathered. The facts of the field resarch reveal that the growth and development of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> in Indonesia is more influenced by the role and participation of the Investment Managers rather than by the degree of knowledge and understanding on the side of public investors, as may be seen from the fact that the development in the open-end Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> which is not necessarily corelated to the preference of public investors to choose Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> product. Legal obstacles that make <b>closed-end</b> Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Fund</b> is less-developed than open-end Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> among the <b>Investment</b> Managers are in fact closely related to the legal procedure of establishment, flexibility in management, support from the government [...] particularly in term of taxation, and the marketability of the product of open-end Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds.</b> As a business stucture, the characteristic of the institution and activity of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> lies more on its purpose to protect the interest of public investors in investment portfolio than on the juridical structure of company organization. Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> institution in the form of limited liability company is cathegories as 'PT Terbuka' with specialities in the capital structure, the system/structure in managing the company's assets and the rights of the share-holders. Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> in the formof collective investment contrat basically falls within the cathegory of business entities which are established by a particular contract containing legal relationship of providing service in management and depository of collective investment assets for the interest of investors as a single unit. In term of activity, both kind of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> share the same goals in giving investment benefit (economical rights) coming from securities portfolio, [...] which is managed by the Investment Manager [...] , in a diversified way to the beneficiary, that is the share holders/participation unit holders in a particular form influenced by the purposes character of the formation of securities portfolio of the relevant Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds.</b> The control of BAPEPAM over the activities of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> to protect public investors is hampered by the purpose and interest on the government's part in stimulating the development of the quantity of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> industry. Consequently, the control is more focused on fostering Investment Manager as reflected from the whistleblowing nature of the legal sanctions, from the compliance request, and the from the refusal to approve the request of dismissing Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> by <b>Investment</b> Manager on the ground that Investment Manager is expected to participate in developing trust in the Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds.</b> The reponsibility system of Investment Manager as the manager of Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds</b> to the investor can be cathegorized as fiduciary duties, based on either the law or the management contract. As a consequence of the representative nature of the duties given, the authority of the Investment Manager is restrictied by good-faith in the transaction of the fund and the securities as the investment portfolio of the Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds.</b> There is also a mechanism in settling the transaction of the securities which falls within the authority and responsibility of the Custodian Bank so that interest of the investors is more protected. Although there is a principle that Investment Manager should be responsible for any damage caused by his mistake or negligence, the customer bears the investment risk on the reason that the action is within the boundary of the good-faith principle in the Public <b>Investment</b> <b>Funds.</b> Any dispute emerging from investment loss tend to be settled out of the court, that is by the Investment Manager's explanation to the investors, by the Investment Manager's compliance with BAPEPAM's rule and by the acceptance of the administrative sanction delivered by BAPEPAM. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of Swedish and Scandinavian investor sentiment on the net asset value discounts of <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> companies. While previous studies have linked sentiment to discounts, both Scandinavian and Swedish evidence is lacking. The study contributes to existing literature by further developing the methodology by Baker & Wurgler (2006) to examine the investor sentiment effect brought forward by Lee et al. (1991) in a Scandinavian setting. In particular, this study offers additional evidence to Hjelström (2007) regarding the aggregate discounts of <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> companies in Swedish capital markets. Unlike previous studies, I provide evidence on individual investment companies and consider both regional and local sentiment as an explanatory factor. DATA The investor sentiment data set covers quarterly data for stock mutual fund inflows, trading volume for aggregate equity markets, and the number and first-day returns of all main-list IPOs within the time period of 1. 1. 1999 to 31. 3. 2011 separately for Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway. The net asset value data set covers 854 quarter-end net asset value discounts (or premiums) of 20 <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> companies during the same time period. Both of the novel datasets were manually collected from multiple sources. RESULTS My main findings indicate that the aggregate net asset value discount of <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> companies is not a sentiment indicator. I show that investor sentiment does not affect aggregate discounts but rather affects the discounts of individual <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> companies. Furthermore, sentiment affects the discounts of individual investment companies in conflicting ways (i. e. positive sentiment can either increase or decrease discounts). Finally, I find evidence indicating that discounts of individual investment companies do not exhibit correlation, and that the strength of the sentiment effect varies substantially between different types of individual investment companies. My results are mostly in contrast to Lee et al. (1991) but in line with Hjelström (2007) ...|$|R

Although US investment trusts of the 1920 s boom years were heavily influenced by their earlier UK counterparts, they differed from British investment trusts in a number of key ways, in particular, size, capital structure, tax and accounting practices, management, and costs. These differences led to their relatively much worse performance in the stock market crash of the late 1920 s and early 1930 s. This poor US trust performance led directly to the creation of the US open-ended ‘fixed trust’, marketed as an antidote to the generally poor management of conventional <b>closed-end</b> <b>investment</b> trusts. As confidence in mutual funds slowly returned in the United States, open-ended funds were gradually given more flexibility, but US investment trust companies, with share prices at a steep discount to liquidation value, and partly blamed for the crash, were encouraged to convert to mutual fund status by the 1936 Revenue Act.
