The arrow, besides the fire it carried with it, had a head, or a peg, as we call it, of bone; and some of sharp flint stone; and some few of a metal, too soft in itself for metal, but hard enough to cause it to enter, {{if it were a}} plank, so as to stick where it fell.|$|E
60|$|The pump {{had just}} stopped, and Tom came towards them, rubbing his greasy {{hands with a}} <b>cotton</b> <b>rag,</b> as they moved in the {{direction}} of the engine room. The lower part of it was dripping when they went down, and a foot or two of water still lay upon the floor-plates where they met the depressed side, but it was evident that another hour's work of the big pump would leave the place almost dry. Austin sat down on a tool-locker lid, with Jefferson standing beside him, but Tom floundered away towards the stoke-hold, and they could hear him splashing in the water. When he reappeared with a blinking lamp he crawled up the slippery ladder as though working out a clue, while it was several minutes before he came back and leaned against a column opposite Jefferson with the look of a man who had not found quite what he had expected.|$|E
6000|$|She {{rose from}} her chair, {{thinking}} she would require rest before the long pull in the early morning. The lamp was burning dimly, and her father, tired with the day's labour, was already in his hammock. Nina put the lamp out and passed into a large room she shared with her mother on {{the left of the}} central passage. Entering, she saw that Mrs. Almayer had deserted the pile of mats serving her as bed {{in one corner of the}} room, and was now bending over the opened lid of her large wooden chest. Half a shell of cocoanut filled with oil, where a <b>cotton</b> <b>rag</b> floated for a wick, stood on the floor, surrounding her with a ruddy halo of light shining through the black and odorous smoke. Mrs. Almayer's back was bent, and her head and shoulders hidden in the deep box. Her hands rummaged in the interior, where a soft clink as of silver money could be heard. She did not notice at first her daughter's approach, and Nina, standing silently by her, looked down on many little canvas bags ranged in the bottom of the chest, wherefrom her mother extracted handfuls of shining guilders and Mexican dollars, letting them stream slowly back again through her claw-like fingers. The music of tinkling silver seemed to delight her, and her eyes sparkled with the reflected gleam of freshly- minted coins. She was muttering to herself: [...] "And this, and this, and yet this! Soon he will give more--as much more as I ask. He is a great Rajah--a Son of Heaven! And she will be a Ranee--he gave all this for her! Who ever gave anything for me? I am a slave! Am I? I am the mother of a great Ranee!" [...] She became aware suddenly of her daughter's presence, and ceased her droning, shutting the lid down violently; then, without rising from her crouching position, she looked up at the girl standing by with a vague smile on her dreamy face.|$|E

50|$|Water wheels {{date to the}} Roman {{period and}} were used to grind grain and lift {{irrigation}} water. Water powered bellows were in use on blast furnaces in China in 31 AD. By the 13th century, water wheels powered sawmills and trip hammers, to full cloth and pound flax and later <b>cotton</b> <b>rags</b> into pulp for making paper. Trip hammers are shown crushing ore in De re Metallica (1555).|$|R
50|$|Cotton {{was first}} used {{with a mixture of}} silk to make paper called Carta Bombycina. In the 1800s, fiber crops such as flax fibres or cotton from used cloths (rags) were the primary {{material}} source. By the turn of the 20th century, most paper was made from wood pulp, but cotton is still used in specialty papers. As <b>cotton</b> <b>rags</b> now often contain synthetic fibres, papermakers have turned to second-cut cotton linters as raw material sources for making pulp for cotton papers.|$|R
50|$|The paper base {{or support}} {{serves as the}} {{substrate}} onto which the subsequent layers are attached. Paper {{is in many ways}} an ideal support: it is lightweight, flexible, and strong enough to withstand both wet processing and regular handling. The photographic paper base must be free of photoactive impurities such as iron and lignins. In order to obtain this purity, the paper was originally made from <b>cotton</b> <b>rags,</b> though after World War I there was a transition to purified wood pulp, which has been used ever since.|$|R
50|$|Paper {{manufacture}} {{started in}} Sittingbourne in 1708, when Peter Archer was recorded as a Paper Maker.

50|$|All {{shingles}} were organic {{at first}} with the base material, called felt, being primarily <b>cotton</b> <b>rag</b> until the 1920s when <b>cotton</b> <b>rag</b> became more expensive and alternative materials were used. Other organic materials used as the felt included wool, jute or manila, and wood pulp. In 1926 the Asphalt Shingle and Research Institute with the National Bureau of Standards tested twenty two types of experimental felts and found {{no significant differences in}} performance. In the 1950s self-sealing and manually applied adhesives began to be used to help prevent wind damage to shingle roofs. The design standard was for the self-sealing strips of adhesive to be fully adhered after sixteen hours at 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Also in the 1950s testing on the use of 3/4 inch staples rather than roofing nails was carried out showing they could perform as well as nails but with six staples compared with four nails. In 1960 fiberglass mat bases were introduced with limited success, the lighter more flexible shingles proved to be more susceptible to wind damage particularly at freezing temperatures. Also in the 1960s research into hail damage which was found to occur when hail reach a size larger than 1.5 inches.|$|E
50|$|Like the Platinotype and Cyanotype, the kallitype is {{a contact}} {{printing}} {{process and the}} printer must have a negative of equal size to print from. Modern kallitypes are generally made from either a large format camera negative, an enlarged internegative from a traditional wet darkroom, or a Digital Negative. <b>Cotton</b> <b>rag</b> paper is generally recommended for printing kallitypes, although multiple paper types will lead to satisfactory results.

50|$|Papermaking, a 2nd-century Chinese technology, {{was carried}} to the Middle East {{when a group of}} Chinese papermakers were {{captured}} in the 8th century. Papermaking technology was spread to Europe by the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. A paper mill was established in Sicily in the 12th century. In Europe the fiber to make pulp for making paper was obtained from linen and <b>cotton</b> <b>rags.</b> Lynn White credited the spinning wheel with increasing the supply of rags, which led to cheap paper, which was a factor in the development of printing.|$|R

30|$|The {{drying rate}} of linseed oil is too slow for {{convenient}} applications, necessitating {{the addition of}} metallic salts (drying agents) to accelerate the drying process (Mallégol et al. 2000). Unfortunately, {{in the presence of}} lignocellulosic fuels, such as cotton fibres, these agents may induce the fuel’s self-heating and autoignition. This dangerous side effect of the oil has been known to fire investigators for almost 200 [*]years (Abraham 1996). Several cases of fire have been reported; in particular those induced by improperly disposed rags soaked with linseed oil. Typical ignition scenarios involve waste baskets filled with disposed <b>cotton</b> <b>rags</b> used to clean paint brushes.|$|R

50|$|Before the 1850s, {{linen and}} <b>cotton</b> <b>rag</b> {{were the primary}} {{material}} source for papermaking, but a shortage drove the market to develop the notoriously acidic wood-pulp alternative. With the advent of steam-driven paper making machines such as the Fourdrinier in the 19th century, {{in conjunction with the}} advent of the steam driven rotary printing press, wood based paper caused a major transformation of the 19th century economy and society in industrialized countries. The wide availability of cheap wood based paper can be credited with the birth of ephemera, and consequently with the birth of modern paper preservation, as large quantities of rapidly deteriorating materials needed the attention of science.|$|E
50|$|The process {{started with}} paper made from cotton rags. Before the {{processing}} of wood pulp and chemical wood pulps in the mid-19th century, the dominant fibre source for paper making was cotton and linen rags. The <b>cotton</b> <b>rag</b> sheet produced for conversion to vulcanized fibre is made like a sheet suitable for saturating. A paper is made for saturating by omitting any sizing additive, either beater added or surface applied. Today most paper sheets made for writing, printing, and coating have internal (beater added) sizing provided by rosin, alkyl succinic anhydride (ASA), or alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) and surface sizing provided by starch. A sheet made for saturating {{would have none of}} those chemical ingredients. The unsized saturating cotton fibre paper prepared for vulcanized fibre would be passed through a vat containing a zinc chloride solution.|$|E
