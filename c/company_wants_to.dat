When a foreign <b>company</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> set up a Level2 program, it must file a registration statement with the SEC and is under SEC regulation.

25|$|Moreover, {{the third}} theater program aims to {{transform}} the business model. Basically, companies create new forms of business to address social or environmental challenges {{that will lead to}} financial returns in the long run. One example can be seen in Unilever's Project Shakti in India. The authors describe that the company hires women in villages and provides them with micro-finance loans to sell soaps, detergents, and other products door-to-door. This research indicates that more than 65,000 women entrepreneurs are doubling their incomes while increasing rural access and hygiene in Indian villages.

500|$|Inspired by live instrumentation, turntablism, {{and classic}} soul music, Tony! Toni! Ton√©! {{recorded}} and produced their second album, The Revival, mostly themselves and released it in 1990 to commercial success. The record broadened the group's exposure to fans beyond their initial R audience. However, they became ambivalent about their newfound mainstream success and their music being labeled [...] "retro" [...] by critics. In {{an interview for}} People magazine, lead singer and bassist Raphael Wiggins expressed his dissatisfaction with the music industry, saying that [...] "every record <b>company</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> get a group and put 'em in a Benz with a car phone and a beeper, show them dressing in three different outfits, {{put them in a}} video shot on a beach with lots of swinging bikinis. You won't ever see us on a beach. We're just down-to-earth, funky, like-to-play guys." [...] Before considering a follow-up album, the band recorded several songs for film soundtracks, including [...] "Me and You" [...] for Boyz n the Hood (1991), [...] "House Party (I Don't Know What You Come to Do)" [...] for House Party 2 (1991), and [...] "Waiting on You" [...] for Poetic Justice (1993).|$|E

Tricia is nervous that Mark will find Frank had a paternity test, so she gets all his records and gives them to Mark in a sealed envelope. But Mark says he needs to add a cover letter and opens the envelope anyway. Of course he sees Frank took the test and demands to know what's going on. Mark's furious. Tricia runs away and Mark's left {{to deal with the}} hideous realisation that Chrissie's not his daughter and that his dad was a rapist. Then to make matters worse, he has to work with Chrissie, pretending everything's normal. I know that if I were in his shoes, I certainly wouldn't tell her. It doesn't take much imagination to realise how devastating that kind of news would be for Chrissie. Mark loves her and, {{at the end of the}} day, that's all that counts." ...|$|E
