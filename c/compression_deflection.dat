40|$|The {{impact force}} due to huge {{boulders}} {{of the debris}} flow is very large and can easily cause damages to debris control structures. It is intended to carry out impact tests {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of using wasted-tire cushion device on reducing the maximum impact force. Both impact forces and deflection were recorded by using an iron ball striking wasted-tire cushion device. The results indicate that, filling gradation crushed stones within wasted-tires can reduce the <b>compression</b> <b>deflection.</b> These tires not only serve as an effective cushion system, but also avoid damages when suffering enormous impact. The cushion can reduce the maximum impact force over 99 percent with longer impact durations. Moreover, the energy absorbed by tires appears to be more than 93 ﹪. Therefore, the application of wasted-tire cushion materials can have great effectiveness on buffering and reducing energy, and thus enhancing the safety of the structure. 由於土石流之巨礫撞擊力十分強大，容易造成防災構造物之損壞，因此本研究進行衝擊試驗，模擬防砂構造物前加置內填或不內填砂石之廢輪胎，並撞擊不同的胎面與點位，藉以探討是否能有效地消減撞擊時之能量。同時分析撞擊時消減之能量多寡，期能瞭解凹陷量與勁度等相關特性，使設計保護結構物安全時有更明確之依據。 本試驗之結果顯示，在輪胎內加入碎石級配後可以有效控制壓縮量，促使廢輪胎可以保持良好的緩衝效果，不受衝擊過大而損壞，經計算使用廢輪胎可降低 99 %左右之直接衝擊力，且衝擊歷時增加使動能消減比例至少可達 93 %以上。因此於土石流攔阻結構前可設置輪胎型式之緩衝設施，利用廢輪胎受撞擊時之變形量，提供極佳之緩衝消能效果，以達保護結構物安全之效能。第一章 緒論	 1 1. 1 前言	 1 1. 2 研究動機	 2 1. 3 研究目的	 3 第二章 文獻回顧	 4 2. 1 土石流特性	 4 2. 2 土石流之發生方式	 4 2. 3 土石流之流動	 5 2. 4 土石流巨礫撞擊力之研究	 6 2. 5 緩衝材料	 8 2. 6 廢輪胎擋土牆之經濟分析	 10 2. 7 廢輪胎於工程上之運用	 12 2. 8 廢輪胎之處理方式	 13 第三章 實驗室試驗配置	 15 3. 1 試驗設備	 15 3. 2 試驗配置	 19 3. 2. 1 渠槽基本配置	 19 3. 2. 2 試驗配置	 19 3. 3 試驗方法與步驟	 23 第四章 試驗結果	 26 4. 1 前期試驗差異	 26 4. 2 理論公式	 27 4. 3 試驗結果	 29 4. 3. 1 撞擊曲線說明	 29 4. 3. 2 第一試驗組試驗結果	 30 4. 3. 3 第二試驗組試驗結果	 40 4. 3. 4 驗證組試驗結果	 46 4. 4 試驗結果分析	 49 4. 4. 1 撞擊速度與理論衝量	 49 4. 4. 2 驗證組分析	 50 4. 4. 3 撞擊力分析	 51 4. 4. 4 實測與推算衝量之分析	 53 4. 4. 5 等效彈簧勁度計算	 56 4. 4. 5 最大撞擊力削減程度	 57 4. 4. 6 撞擊力動能折減比例之分析	 58 4. 4. 7 試驗結果與討論	 60 第五章 結論與建議	 61 5. 1 結論	 61 5. 2 建議	 62 參考文獻	 63 附錄Ι- A	 65 附錄Ι- B	 73 附錄Ι- C	 78 附錄Ι- D	 80 附錄Ι- E	 8...|$|E
40|$|Many {{different}} {{materials are}} used in the National Ignition Facility, NIF, located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, LLNL. Some of these are exposed to significant doses of ionizing radiation. Two elastomers are of special interest because they {{are used in}} sealing applications with long expected lifetimes. These are LPU 4, a polyurethane formulated at LLNL, and Dow Corning DC 93 - 500, a silicone RTV elastomer. In 2004 a program to determine the impact of ionizing radiation on the stress relaxation and compression set characteristics of these two elastomers was undertaken. Since the materials are used in continuous compression and must reliably seal, the primary test utilized was a stress relaxation test. This test provides insight into the ability of a seal to remain functional in a static seal. The test determines how much residual force remains after {{a certain period of time}} under compression. The temperature and absorbed radiation dose can dramatically impact this property. In this study the only independent environmental variable studied is the effect of radiation at ambient temperatures. Two levels of radiation exposure were studied, 1 MRad, and 10 MRad. One of the independent test parameters is the <b>compression</b> <b>deflection</b> during storage and in this test the value used was 25 %. The need for a compression retention mechanism ruled out radiation exposure in the compressed direction since the high atomic number materials for that device would block the radiation. Therefore, an annular ring was chosen for the specimen shape. The procedures are, as closely as possible, based on ASTM D 6147 - 97. Since the data is readily obtained at the end of the stress relaxation test, the samples were also evaluated for compression set. Compression set is the essentially permanent deformation incurred in a seal after the seal is compressed for some period of time and then unloaded. Though this is indicative of potential sealing reliability, it is not as direct an indicator of seal performance as is stress relaxation. Compression set does not yield any useable, quantified information but is an indicator of viscoelastic deformation with time. The needed thickness measurements were obtained both from the unloading curves and direct measurement in general accordance with ASTM D 395 - 03. The radiation source for this testing was the Co 60 gamma source located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). This source has an exposure vessel approximately 29. 2 cm (11. 5 -inch) tall with an inside diameter of 7. 44 cm (2. 93 -inch). Because of the geometry limits, cylindrical symmetry and limited volume, a standard stress relaxation test such as ASTM D 6147 - 97 could not be utilized and a modified test was developed. An additional constraint imposed by the vertical asymmetry of the radiation dose in the exposure chamber was a limited height with reasonably uniform radiation exposure. The specific dimensions and radiation characteristics of the test cell are in Appendix A...|$|E

The experimental data were compared with the aerodynamic characteristics estimated using Newtonian theory, thus establishing the usefulness of these predictions. The candidate AMOOS configurations selected for the wind tunnel tests were the AMOOS 5 B and HB configurations. Two flap configurations were tested for each candidate - a forward or compression surface flap and an aft or expansion flap.

40|$|Magnetic-field {{measurements}} made {{on board}} the Apollo 15 and 16 subsatellites in low-altitude lunar orbit are used to study compressions of the magnetic field over terminator regions when the moon is in the solar wind. These compressional disturbances occur at {{just in front of}} the terminator, but only when specific selenographic regions appear at the lunar limb. The occurrence rate, strength, and position of the compression relative to the limb are different for each source region. Where overlaps of limb-compression occurrence statistics and lunar magnetic-field maps exist, the limb-compression occurrence rates have a high degree of correlation with magnetic-field strength.

40|$|Polyurethane foams have a {{wide variety}} of {{commercial}} applications in daily life due to their unique advantages. Traditionally, polyurethane foams are made from petroleum-based polyols and isocyanates. Due to the shortage of fossil resources, renewable biobased materials are studied as alternatives to petroleum. In this project, castor oil was chosen as a renewable biobased polyol in order to replace the nonrenewable petroleum-based polyols. Water-blown rigid foams were made from polyols with different levels of castor oil replacement. For foams without castor oil and with 25 % castor oil replacement, the effects of water added content were studied. Another group of foams made from a castor oil/ glycerol mixture were also prepared to investigate the effects of hydroxyl number. With the help of glycerol, rigid polyurethane foams with 80 %- 95 % castor oil replacement were successfully prepared and showed competitive physical properties. Water-blown flexible foams were made from polyols using different levels of castor oil replacement. At the same time, the influence of cross-linker contents and isocyanate index on flexible foam was studied. Considering the low reaction rate of castor oil during the synthesis of polyurethane, a specific "heated mold" method was applied. Density, <b>compression</b> force <b>deflection</b> (CFD), 50 % constant <b>deflection</b> <b>compression</b> (CDC), tear resistance (TR) and resilience were tested to identify the physical properties of flexible polyurethane foams. Results show that castor oil replacement often leads to a high cross-linking density. With 0. 5 % necessary cross-linker and low isocyanate index, flexible polyurethane foams with 100 % castor oil replacement showed a good recovery property and proved to be a suitable alternative to nonrenewable petroleum-based polyols...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{analysis}} of data from the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO) {{has shown that the}} bow shock often travels to unusually large distances from the planet when the solar wind magnetosonic Mach number is near unity. We suggest that distant bow shocks can be explained {{as an integral part of}} the response of the global solar wind/Venus interaction to the anomalous local solar wind conditions that existed during the time of these observations. The lower-than-normal plasma beta and magnetosonic Mach number are in a parameter regime for which the usual fast-mode bow shock close to the planet may not provide the necessary <b>compression</b> and <b>deflection</b> of the solar wind. Using MHD simulations we show that, for these conditions, the usual fast shock is replaced by a bow shock consisting of an intermediate shock near the Sun-Venus line and a fast shock at large distances from the Sun-Venus line. This composite bow shock propagates upstream away from the planet at a low speed and appears to be approaching a new equilibrium stand-off location at a large distance from the planet...|$|R

A simplified heat transfer model proposed by Lattimer is adopted for the thermal response model to determine temperature distributions in composite structures with and without insulation while an assumed strain solid shell finite element formulation is adopted for the structural response model with a material model that takes into account the effects of temperature on modulus and charring. Numerical analyses are carried out to determine the time-to-failure via the global buckling of simply supported and clamped wide columns of an E-glass/ vinylester woven composite material with and without insulation subjected to heat flux and <b>compression.</b> Large <b>deflection</b> non-linear analyses are also conducted to determine the displacement of the columns as the temperature changes.

40|$|Space weather {{effects on}} {{technological}} systems originate with energy carried from the Sun to the terrestrial environment by the solar wind. In this study, we present results of modeling of solar corona-heliosphere processes to predict solar wind {{conditions at the}} L 1 Lagrangian point upstream of Earth. In particular we calculate performance metrics for (1) empirical, (2) hybrid empirical/physics-based, and (3) full physics-based coupled corona-heliosphere models over an 8 -year period (1995 – 2002). L 1 measurements of the radial solar wind speed are the primary basis for validation of the coronal and heliosphere models studied, though other solar wind parameters are also considered. The models are from the Center for Integrated Space-Weather Modeling (CISM) which has developed a coupled model of the whole Sun-to-Earth system, from the solar photosphere to the terrestrial thermosphere. Simple point-by-point analysis techniques, such as mean-square-error and correlation coefficients, indicate that the empirical coronal-heliosphere model currently gives the best forecast of solar wind speed at 1 AU. A more detailed analysis shows that errors in the physics-based models are predominately the result of small timing offsets to solar wind structures and that the large-scale features of the solar wind are actually well modeled. We suggest that additional “tuning” of the coupling between the coronal and heliosphere models {{could lead to a}} significant improvement of their accuracy.

Basic properties (e. g., density, total and available porosity, permeability, surface area, isotropicity, and cell size and cell wall thickness distributions) were measured. In most cases, alternative methods {{were used to}} determine which methods were most appropriate for the type of samples we studied. Standard <b>compression</b> and <b>deflection</b> mechanical tests were performed. The stress-strain curves and related mechanical properties were found to agree with standard cellular structural models of open-cell foams. We investigated the effects of small (3 ̆c 5 atm) hydrostatic stress applied to foam samples {{for long periods of time}} (one day). We observed large changes (up to a factor of three) in the stress-strain diagrams, Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus, elastic collapse stress, ultimate strength, resilience, Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio, permeability, penetration depth, and available porosity. Effects were most pronounced above 2 atm applied pressure differential, but were observed even for 1 atm loads. Short-term exposure to loads up to ten times as large did not cause comparable changes. These changes were interpreted as resulting from observed changes in the mesoscopic structure occurring near the surface using standard cellular structural models. This work was originally motivated by applications of foam as an inflating agent and structural component of fiber-epoxy composite tubular struts to be used in innovative space structures. The key recommendations of this study, regarding such applications, are to closely monitor the effects on the mechanical properties of polystyrene foam of: (1) cell structure and density inhomogeneities, and (2) pressure differentials which may be encountered during deployment and curing...|$|R
40|$|Rubber pads can be {{employed}} to cut or form sheet metals when acted upon by high pressures in conjunction with suitable tooling. This phenomenon has been incorporated into a production technique known as the Guerin process. It is advantageous in that the manufacturing of the closely mating conventional steel punch and dies can be eliminated, resulting in exceptional press work economies. However, its application has been limited {{due to a lack}} of understanding of the process variables. This thesis analyzes the effects of the rubber characteristics and tool geometry upon the punching of circular holes in aluminum sheet by confined rubber press pads. A Hydrostatic Shear Theory was developed to predict the pressure necessary for punching. Seven rubber compounds were physically tested to obtain bases of comparison for analyzing their punching performances. Four diameters of circular dies were used in conjunction with one type of aluminum sheet to study the punching behaviour of each of the rubbers. Experimental results show that punching occurs in two stages of fracture - primary and secondary. For a given tool geometry the criteria for the initiation of primary fracture is a critical volume rubber displacement. Modified empirical equations are derived from the Hydrostatic Shear Theory relating the experimental primary fracture pressure to tool geometry, material resistance, and rubber stiffness as determined <b>compression</b> - <b>deflection</b> tests. The press pad thickness and rate of loading are also found to influence primary fracture. Secondary fracture appears to depend upon the depth of die employed. The effects of lubrication and lamination of the press pads are briefly explored tor both primary and secondary fracture.

The Hybrid III, in driver position, was {{equipped}} with the chest deflection sensor system RibEye and its standard potentiometer sensor was compared with the RibEye deflection data. The chest impact point was established by using Fuji film impression, as well as from video data. Chest-to-steering wheel rim contact occurred in all tests. Differences in chest loading were found between the Hybrid III dummy reference test and the load case identified in this study, predominantly impact velocity, direction, distribution and location of loading. The steering wheel rim contact is the major contributor to chest deflection. The chest deformation consists of anterior/posterior <b>compression</b> and upward <b>deflection</b> of the sternal plate. The Hybrid III standard chest deflection sensor is not reliable in this load case due to the modes of sternal displacement and the single-point measurement location.

Organostannic compounds are commonly used as catalysts in polyurethane chemistry. Whereas stannous octoate (SNOCT) exhibits a TBT content below the detection limit of most analysis equipment (< 0. 01 %, TBT levels as high as 0. 6 % have been measured in dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL). Although DBTDL manufacturers are currently optimising their process to lower the TBT content in DBTDL, the (chemo) pressure exerted on polyurethane foamers is such that DBTDL-free formulations are being actively looked for. High resilience (HR) foams based on various polymer polyols - particularly polyols made with pure polystyrene (POSTech*) or poly(styrene-acrylonitrile) have been developed using DBTDL as the gel catalyst. The direct replacement of DBTDL is not straightforward, as foam block dimensional stability issues (often referred to as "cold flow") are encountered when other catalyst (i. e., SNOCT) are used. This "cold flow" phenomenon is very much dependent on the size {{and the weight of}} the foam block produced, making all small scale laboratory experiments unsuitable for developing novel stable HR foam formulations. The present research has shown that properties derived from small scale experiments can nevertheless be related to the "cold flowability" of HR formulations. Amongst the various tests investigated, the variation in sag factor from top to bottom of the foam block was found to be the most relevant test method to assess the dimensional stability. Sag factor is here defined as the force exerted by the foam compressed to 65 % of the original thickness divided by that exerted at 25 % compression during the <b>compression</b> load <b>deflection</b> (CLD) test. The test method based on this variation in sag factor through the foam block (vSag) made possible the laboratory examination of formulation parameters for their impact on foam block stability.

MelhemThe Abilene & Smoky Valley Railroad Association offers train {{excursions}} to sightseers {{wishing to}} see historic Abilene and natural Kansas scenery. Currently, a diesel powered ALCO locomotive {{is used to}} pull the passenger cars. They wish to use a 1919 Baldwin steam locomotive in the future. Part of the excursion includes a slow crossing of the Smoky Hill River over a two-span steel truss bridge. The company approached the Kansas State University Civil Engineering Department {{with the task of}} performing a structural check of the bridge. By using the Baldwin locomotive, the bridge is required to support much larger loads than when the diesel engine is used. First, a basic visual inspection and site visit of the bridge was performed. The inspection was not thorough, but was used to familiarize the team with the bridge and its components. Using the inspection and data supplied, a structural analysis was performed using the software, RISA. After completion of the analysis for both loading situations, the resulting stress increases were calculated. Other calculations performed include buckling loads of the <b>compression</b> members, <b>deflections</b> of the bottom chord and stresses in some of the connections. After completion of the analysis and calculations, large increases in member stress were found. For most of the members, the increase of live loads stress was between 80 % and 100 %. The largest stress found due to the dead and live load, which was under 15 ksi, occurred in the bottom chord for the steam locomotive loading situation. Some truss members experienced stress reversal, but relatively low values were noted. Deflection calculations for the two loading situations yielded similar results to the stress calculations. Again, an increase in deflection between 80 % and 100 % was found for the joints located on the bottom chord.

Built-up column steel structure also can be formed by various profile. However the column subjected to compression load will occur buckling which is related to element stiffness of structure. An element which has low stiffness is easier to buckle than element with high stiffness. The objective {{of this research is}} to characterize stiffness of built up column. Research is performed in laboratory by compression test of built up steel column to obtain its deflection value. Stiffness is calculated from division between capacities <b>compression</b> by its <b>deflection</b> value.

40|$|A flat {{piece of}} {{corrugated}} fiberboard, {{which has been}} cut, slotted and scored, {{is often referred to}} as a box blank. For several box styles, in order to convert the box blank into a box, its two ends must be fastened together with tape, staples or adhesives such as water soluble glues. The location at which the two ends meet is known as the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s joint. There are several variations within the three fastening techniques mentioned with most corrugated box manufacturers following their own protocols for fastening the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s joints. This study explored the compression and tensile strengths of RSC style corrugated boxes based on adhesive (glue) coverage, three different types of tapes (acrylic, paper and reinforced paper) and application angle of staples. The fabricated boxes were also tested for <b>compression</b> strength and <b>deflection.</b> Test data (N = 10) was collected for each dependent variable of peak force, deflection at peak force and tensile strength using the analysis of variance procedure with a Turkey probability distribution at a 0. 05 critical limit. The results suggest an overall higher tensile strength for glue than the other fastening techniques evaluated (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with no significant difference (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) for peak force or deflection at peak force for all glued, stapled or taped treatments...|$|R

There be responsibility to modify the housing design and construction technologies which are used today to reduce the cost, CO 2 emission, and sustainable development and energy conservation concept. There is a need to focus on such materials which along with traditional construction materials as brick to satisfy the properties like thermal conductivity, embodied energy, durability, sound insulation, earthquake resistance and strength. The use of expanded polystyrene beads (EPS) is best suitable for this purpose. In this paper an attempt has be made to review the strength aspects of EPS embedded as a non -load bearing internal wall and its prospective design and implementation in the building to make it energy efficient. The main purpose of this study is to design the optimum mix percentage of the EPS brick for non-load bearing internal wall application and to compare the strength performance of EPS brick wall compared to conventional brick wall. With regard to the laboratory tests, several compression tests were performed on wall samples. Wall sample has been built with expanded brick connected with mortar. The mix proportions of EPS use are 0 %, 16. 7 %, 33. 3 % and 50 % of sand replacement. Depending on the four types of in situ tests carried out (<b>compression</b> test, <b>deflection</b> test, strain stress test, and thermal insulation test), same dimensions of prism were use. The test conducted based on ASTM C 129 - 85 (1990) testing standards. The experimental study shows that EPS prism application achieved the standard average strength 3. 45 MPa, the highest compressive stress value for EPS brick prism by 16. 7 % EPS brick, about 3. 90 MPa with 18. 48 kg weight. The modulus elasticity about 13. 34 MPa for 16. 7 % EPS is the highest among three sample. The lowest deflection value is about 1. 75 mm for sample 16. 7 % EPS. The thermal conductivity lowest value is 0. 21 W/mK for 50 % EPS replacement. Conclude that, the EPS beads is suitable to replaced sand in brick making process and able to applied as non-load bearing wall in construction...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new class}} of flight control actuators using Post-Buckled Precompressed (PBP) piezoelectric elements to provide much improved actuator performance. These PBP actuator elements are modeled using basic large deflection Euler-beam estimations accounting for laminated plate effects. The deflection estimations are then coupled to a high rotation kinematic model which translates PBP beam bending to stabilator deflections. A test article using PZT- 5 H piezoceramic sheets built into an active bender element was fitted with an elastic band which induced much improved deflection levels. Statically the bender element was capable of producing unloaded end rotations on the order of ± 2. 6 °. With axial <b>compression,</b> the end <b>deflections</b> were shown to increase nearly 4 -fold. The PBP element was then fitted with a graphite-epoxy aeroshell which was designed to pitch around a tubular stainless steel main spar. Quasi-static bench testing showed excellent correlation between theory and experiment through ± 25 ° of pitch deflection. Finally, wind tunnel testing was conducted at airspeeds up to 120 kts (62 m/s, 202 ft/s). Testing showed that deflections up through ± 20 ° could be maintained at even the highest flight speed. The stabilator showed no flutter or divergence tendencies at all flight speeds. At higher deflection levels, it was shown that a slight degradation deflection was induced by nose-down pitching moments generated by separated flow conditions induced by extremely high angles of attack.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the use of}} a new class of flight control actuators employing Post-Buckled Precompressed (PBP) piezoelectric elements in morphing wing Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The new actuator relies on axial <b>compression</b> to amplify <b>deflections</b> and control forces simultaneously. Two designs employing morphing wing panels based on PBP actuators were conceived. One design relied on a change in curvature of the actuators to control the camber of the airfoil. Axial compression of the actuators was ensured by means of rubber bands and increased end rotation levels with almost a factor of two up to +/- 13. 6 deg peak-to-peak, with excellent correlation between theory and experiment. Wind tunnel tests quantitatively proved that wing morphing induced roll acceleration levels in excess of 1500 deg/sˆ 2. A second design employed PBP actuators in a wing panel with significant thickness, relying on a highly compliant Latex skin to allow for shape deformation {{and at the same time}} induce an axial force on the actuators. Bench tests showed that due to the axial compression provided by the skin end rotations were increased with more than a factor of two up to +/- 15. 8 deg peak-to-peak up to a break frequency of 34 Hz. Compared to conventional electromechanical servoactuaters, the PBP actuators showed a net reduction in flight control system weight, slop and power consumption for minimal part count. Both morphing wing concepts showed that PBP piezoelectric actuators have significant benefits over conventional actuators and can be successfully applied to induce aircraft control.

40|$|The {{flexible}} {{nature of}} the cable bundles in the sizeable cable-in-conduit-conductors for ITER containing {{more than a thousand}} strands, in combination with a void fraction of around 30 %, gives scope for significant cable <b>compression</b> and strand <b>deflection.</b> In particular, the transverse stiffness of the Nb 3 Sn type of cabled superconductors, being subjected to large electromagnetic forces, is critical for their long-term performance considering the impact of the strain variation on the transport properties. What is more, the compression of the cable bundle under load and the permanent deformation and relaxation in time or that associated with quenches, {{have an effect on the}} cooling and pressure drop along the turns of the windings and are valuable to account for in large magnets such as for ITER. The electromagnetic AC losses of ITER Nb 3 Sn and NbTi CICCs, related to changing magnetic field and in this manner important for their stability, were broadly studied and reported but the associated mechanical losses have received less attention so far. The lifetime characteristics in terms of cable compression, changes in transverse stiffness and mechanical losses are experimentally determined on several prototype ITER NbTi and Nb 3 Sn conductors in the Twente press and a summary of the results is given. The nonlinear stress–strain characteristics of the cable bundle and its moderate time-dependent nature can be considered as a viscoelastic–plastic phenomenon. The evolution of the stiffness and the mechanical loss depends on the peak load, void fraction, strand type and strand coating and changes with the number of load cycles. The dissipated heat from mechanical energy is not a critical issue for ITER magnet operation but is not negligible, in particular in the case of NbTi conductors...|$|R
