The Ape Canyon eruptive period ended around 35,000 years ago and was followed by 17,000 years of relative quiet.

5|$|The Great Western Main Line from London to Bristol is in {{the process}} of being electrified.

This will leave Temple Meads un-electrified but the new Hitachi Super Express trains are bi-mode so can operate as diesels around Bristol and can use electricity where the electrification work is complete. The electrification plans do not extend west of Bristol so local services will continue to be provided using diesel trains, with Class 165/166s <b>cascaded</b> from Thames Valley services scheduled to replace the 150/153/158s on local services.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cascade</b> Range or <b>Cascades</b> {{is a major}} {{mountain}} range of western North America, extending from southern British Columbia through Washington and Oregon to Northern California.

The latter term is also sometimes used by Washington residents to refer to the Washington section of the <b>Cascades</b> in addition to North <b>Cascades,</b> the more usual U.S. term, as in North <b>Cascades</b> National Park.

40|$|Presently, the gas {{centrifuge}} arranged in <b>cascades</b> {{is the most}} common method for enriching uranium in its fissionable isotope, 235 U. The enriching process can be modeled in two overarching steps. First, one examines the individual centrifuge machines, estimating enriching performance based on operating conditions such as the centrifuge feed flow rate and cut. Second, this information is built into a <b>cascade</b> analysis which considers the <b>cascade</b> structure (how the machines are linked together) as well as the total <b>cascade</b> feed, product, and waste flow rates. This paper, which focuses on {{the second half of the}} modeling process, outlines a method for analyzing one centrifuge <b>cascade</b> structure recently developed and implemented by Iran. The novel configuration consists of two conventional <b>cascades</b> interconnected in a tandem fashion. In this arrangement, the waste flow from the first <b>cascade</b> enters the second <b>cascade</b> as feed flow. The waste leaving this (the second) <b>cascade</b> becomes the overall waste flow and the associated product is reintroduced into the first <b>cascade.</b> Because the two <b>cascades</b> are linked – the flow leaving the first <b>cascade</b> affects the operation of the second <b>cascade,</b> and vice versa – the traditional method for analyzing single <b>cascades</b> is inadequate. This paper presents an extension of the conventional analysis procedure that is appropriate for tandem <b>cascades.</b> The new method is used to assess Iran’s tandem <b>cascades,</b> including their utility for producing highly-enriched uranium for nuclear weapons...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a MIX <b>cascade</b> protocol and a reputation system that together increase {{the reliability of}} a network of MIX <b>cascades.</b> In our protocol, MIX nodes periodically generate a communally random seed that, along with their reputations, determines <b>cascade</b> configuration. Nodes send test messages to monitor their <b>cascades.</b> Senders can also demonstrate message decryptions to convince honest <b>cascade</b> members that a <b>cascade</b> is misbehaving. By allowing any node to declare the failure of its own <b>cascade,</b> we eliminate the need for global trusted witnesses...|$|R

25|$|As with S-parameters, T-parameters {{are complex}} values {{and there is}} a direct {{conversion}} between the two types. Although the <b>cascaded</b> T-parameters is a simple matrix multiplication of the individual T-parameters, the conversion for each network's S-parameters to the corresponding T-parameters and the conversion of the <b>cascaded</b> T-parameters back to the equivalent <b>cascaded</b> S-parameters, which are usually required, is not trivial. However once the operation is completed, the complex full wave interactions between all ports in both directions will be taken into account. The following equations will provide conversion between S and T parameters for 2-port networks.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{learning}} classifier <b>cascades</b> is considered. A new <b>cascade</b> boosting algorithm, fast <b>cascade</b> boosting (FCBoost), is proposed. FCBoost {{is shown to}} {{have a number of}} interesting properties, namely that it 1) minimizes a Lagrangian risk that jointly accounts for classification accuracy and speed, 2) generalizes adaboost, 3) can be made cost-sensitive to support the design of high detection rate <b>cascades,</b> and 4) is compatible with many predictor structures suitable for sequential decision making. It is shown that a rich family of such structures can be derived recursively from <b>cascade</b> predictors of two stages, denoted <b>cascade</b> generators. Generators are then proposed for two new <b>cascade</b> families, last-stage and multiplicative <b>cascades,</b> that generalize the two most popular <b>cascade</b> architectures in the literature. The concept of neutral predictors is finally introduced, enabling FCBoost to automatically determine the <b>cascade</b> conffguration, i. e., number of stages and number of weak learners per stage, for the learned <b>cascades.</b> Experiments on face and pedestrian detection show that the resulting <b>cascades</b> outperform current state-of-the-art methods in both detection accuracy and speed. © 2014 Mohammad Saberian and Nuno Vasconcelos...|$|R

25|$|One {{distinctive}} {{advantage of}} PID controllers is that two PID controllers {{can be used}} together to yield better dynamic performance. This is called <b>cascaded</b> PID control. In cascade control there are two PIDs arranged with one PID controlling the setpoint of another. A PID controller acts as outer loop controller, which controls the primary physical parameter, such as fluid level or velocity. The other controller acts as inner loop controller, which reads the output of outer loop controller as setpoint, usually controlling a more rapid changing parameter, flowrate or acceleration. It can be mathematically proven that the working frequency of the controller is increased and the time constant of the object is reduced by using <b>cascaded</b> PID controllers..|$|E
