5000|$|These swords {{are often}} mistaken for radio antennas. The entire system may include {{upper and lower}} cutter assemblies, a non-electrically {{conductive}} abrasive strip wire scoring device along {{the center of the}} divided windscreen and windshield wiper protector frames to keep wires from hanging up on wiper motor shafts. The WSPS is designed to channel a wire or cable into the cable cutter to score and weaken it as it travels into the <b>cutter</b> <b>assembly</b> and [...] "cut" [...] a wire before it can entangle the rotor system. The U.S. Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker, AL, claims that in a single wire strike 90% survivability is achieved by using WSPS. The more wires encountered at a given time the less likely WSPS will help the aircraft survive the encounter.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe optimal design {{parameters}} of the ultrasonic <b>cutter</b> <b>assembly</b> can be determined {{by means of the}} finite element method (FEM). However it is time-consuming because the combinations of {{design parameters}} are varied and the optimization of acoustic performance indexes is multi-objective. In order to achieve the optimal combination quickly a new method is proposed which combines support vector regression (SVR) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) into the design for ultrasonic <b>cutter</b> <b>assembly.</b> When the ranges of the design parameters are set, some samples are produced easily with the aid of the parameterized software of the finite element method. The approximate model between the design parameters and the acoustic performance indexes is established with support vector regression. Based on the approximate model a large number of samples are produced quickly as initial particles, and the optimal design {{parameters of the}} ultrasonic <b>cutter</b> <b>assembly</b> are defined efficiently with particle swarm optimization. The result demonstrates that the optimization method with SVR-PSO not only reduces the computation time, but also has good accuracy compared with the finite element method...|$|E

40|$|Polycrystalline Diamond Compact (PDC) cutters {{have been}} popularly used {{in recent times}} due to their {{resistance}} against mechanical and thermal wear. This paper was focused on interface geometries between the substrate and the diamond table. Various types of interfaces were designed, to investigate how different interface geometries influence distribution of stress and strain under shear loading. The interface geometries examined in this paper included castle interface, dent interface, honeycomb interface and chase interface. Parallel to the interface, shear loading {{was applied to the}} top of diamond table to mimic the shear loading component from the rock cutting. To apply the shear loading, two locations were considered for each of the geometries. These locations differed depending on the interface features. Stress and strain distribution and values across different interface geometries were analysed with the aid of 3 D Finite Element Method (FEM). The numerical simulations indicated that stress and strain magnitudes and distribution patterns varied in relation to different geometries. Some substrates showed relatively lower plastic strain representing higher durability of the geometries. Concentration of stress and strain distribution showed the areas where one could expect weakness. It also implies that rotating the PDC <b>cutter</b> <b>assemblies</b> around their cylindrical axis helps avoiding fatigue of interface elements in regions of high stress concentration; and thus, preventing premature failure of interface elements...|$|R
50|$|A {{thickness}} planer {{consists of}} three elements: a cutter head which contains the cutting knives; a set of rollers which draw the board through the machine; and a table which is adjustable relative to the cutter head to control the resultant thickness of the board. Some portable thickness planers differ slightly in that the table is fixed and the <b>cutter</b> head/feed roller <b>assembly</b> is adjusted.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSimulation and {{prediction}} of the machining {{process and the}} machined results of milling process is an important link in the control of milling quality. It is important on improving the machined surface quality, improving processing efficiency, and reducing processing errors. In the milling process, the assembly error of the cutting tool has great importance {{that should not be}} ignored for the forming of milled surface. Aiming at the problem of machining error in milling process caused by tool assembly error, this article investigated the milling process of peripheral milling, and researched the surface topography caused by the tool assembly error. Then the author established a simulation model to forecast the processing error caused by peripheral milling <b>cutter</b> <b>assembly</b> error. The model calculates the location of the tooth tipoff the milling tool by analyzing the knife tooth trajectory variation caused by the tool assembly error. Then discrete tracks of the teeth, to obtain the final processed surface by calculating the minimum value of all the teeth traces at discrete points. Through this model, we can get different surface morphology formed by different tool assembly errors to explore how the tool assembly error influences the processing quality. The study shows that when the <b>cutter</b> <b>assembly</b> errors exist, each tooth tip trajectory changes, making the surface topography phenomena that surface rises and falls, and cutting groovesâ€™ size shrinks and expands. Cutting groove depth will change {{in the direction of the}} tool axis direction. The surface roughness will increase when the <b>cutter</b> <b>assembly</b> error increases, but the roughness does not change after increasing to a threshold value...|$|E

The conventional agro-waste disposal is a traditional and oldest method of waste disposal in which agriculture wastes are dumped {{as it is to}} degrade in a particular place for decomposing. As the wastes are dumped as such, it takes more time to degrade and it causes environmental pollution. The shredder machine aims {{to reduce the size of}} agriculture waste which useful for nourishing fertilizer. A shredder machine mainly consists of cutter, mounted on dual shaft, motor is attached at the base, smaller pulley at the motor end gives drive with the help V-belt to bigger pulley which is connected to gear. One gear will give drive to other gear, and Barrel rotates in opposite direction with the help of these gears.

However his father, the Evening News film critic Jympson Harman, secured him as a runner at Ealing Studios. He worked in the cutting-room, aiding Peter Tanner on the 1949 film Kind Hearts and Coronets, before participating in two years of National Service. He returned to Ealing and worked on the films The Cruel Sea (1953) and The Ladykillers (1955). Jympson became an <b>assembly</b> <b>cutter</b> on I Was Monty's Double in 1958.|$|R
