40|$|Microscopic {{behavior}} and distress types in {{continuously reinforced concrete}} pavement (CRCP) were investigated using {{the information in the}} TxDOT’s rigid pavement database. Crack width behavior was evaluated using the information from two test sections. Transverse crack width decreased over time, which is quite <b>contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>what’s</b> been accepted as a general crack width behavior in CRCP. The reason for this decrease is not known. Concrete temperature has a dominant effect on the crack width behavior. Most of the times, CRCP slabs exhibit flexural behavior at transverse cracks due to temperature variations through the depth. The neutral axis for crack width variations appears to exist below the mid-depth. Two major distress types were observed in the field: horizontal cracking induced distress and edge punchouts. Even though the mechanisms for the two distress types are different, the appearance of the two distresses could be quite similar. The mechanism of horizontal cracking appears to be curling of concrete slab, caused by large temperature variations in the upper portion of concrete slab.

An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate.

5|$|A {{biography}} by Galileo's pupil Vincenzo Viviani {{stated that}} Galileo had dropped balls {{of the same}} material, but different masses, from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass. This was <b>contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, {{in direct proportion to}} weight. While this story has been retold in popular accounts, there is no account by Galileo himself of such an experiment, and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most a thought experiment which did not actually take place. An exception is Drake, who argues that the experiment did take place, more or less as Viviani described it. The experiment described was actually performed by Simon Stevin (commonly known as Stevinus) and Jan Cornets de Groot, although the building used was actually the church tower in Delft in 1586. However, most of his experiments with falling bodies were carried out using inclined planes where both the issues of timing and air resistance were much reduced.|$|E
5|$|A lead atom has 82 electrons, {{arranged}} in an electron configuration of 4f145d106s26p2. The combined {{first and second}} ionization energies—the total energy required to remove the two 6p electrons—is close to that of tin, lead's upper neighbor in the carbon group. This is unusual; ionization energies generally fall going down a group, as an element's outer electrons become more distant from the nucleus, and more shielded by smaller orbitals. The similarity of ionization energies {{is caused by the}} lanthanide contraction—the decrease in element radii from lanthanum (atomic number 57) to lutetium (71), and the relatively small radii of the elements after hafnium (72). This is due to poor shielding of the nucleus by the lanthanide 4f electrons. The combined first four ionization energies of lead exceed those of tin, <b>contrary</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> periodic trends would predict. Relativistic effects, which become significant in heavier atoms, contribute to this behavior. One such effect is the inert pair effect: the 6s electrons of lead become reluctant to participate in bonding, making the distance between nearest atoms in crystalline lead unusually long.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by {{the recent}} {{theoretical}} study of (bright) soliton diode effects in systems with multiple scatterers, {{as well as by}} experimental investigations of soliton-impurity interactions, we consider some prototypical case examples of interactions of dark solitons with a pair of scatterers. In a way fundamentally opposite to the case of bright solitons (but consonant to their "anti-particle character"), we find that dark solitons accelerate as they pass the first barrier and hence cannot be trapped by a second equal-height barrier. A pair of unequal barriers may lead to reflection from the second one, however trapping in the inter-barrier region cannot occur. We also give some examples of dynamical adjusting the barriers to trap the dark soliton in the inter-barrier region, yet we show that this can only occur over finite time horizons, with the dark soliton always escaping eventually, <b>contrary</b> again <b>to</b> <b>what</b> is potentially the case with bright solitons.
