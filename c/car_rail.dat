40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to analyse the land {{transport}} accessibility of two trans-European corridors {{within the boundaries of}} Poland. The adjustment of the course of transport routes to the distribution of the population and the country’s land development (including economic potential and logistic infrastructure) was outlined using measurements of cumulative accessibility. The results were presented in both cartographic form (isochrone approach) and tabular form (cumulative approach). Research was conducted adopting different forms of transport used for relocation (including foot traffic, <b>car,</b> <b>rail</b> and multimodal transport) and both the current and target layout of the transport network. This made it possible to determine the changes that will effectively run the process of investment in transport infrastructure on Polish territory. This allowed the identification of the areas of Poland which are particularly conveniently located in relation to domestic connections (in terms of the international network) and those for which the European transport network remains difficult to access...|$|E
500|$|WMATA {{first became}} aware of a <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> {{shortage}} in 1988. Generally, <b>rail</b> <b>cars</b> were ready for service {{three to four years}} after WMATA signed [...] a contract for their purchase. Metrorail also suffered from internal squabbling over <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> design, and <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> production had historically been plagued by poor quality and labor strikes—both of which also added to construction delays. Although WMATA knew in 1988 that it needed at least 98 new <b>rail</b> <b>cars</b> to provide adequate service to the new stations to be added on the Green Line and other lines by 1993, WMATA did not place an order for the cars. By September 1990, WMATA was also confronting more frequent breakdowns in its existing, aging <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> fleet, which heightened the urgency to buy more cars. Officials estimated that the <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> shortage would become critical when the Anacostia Station opened. When the Van Dorn Street Station opened in June 1991, Metro was forced to run trains every 12 minutes during rush hour rather than every 8 due to the <b>rail</b> <b>car</b> shortage. Eventually, crowding was addressed when additional cars became available by running 8-car trains.|$|R

40|$|Cities are {{increasingly}} {{seen as the}} places where innovations that can trigger a sociotechnical transition toward urban mobility are emerging and maturing. Processes such as peak <b>car,</b> <b>rail</b> renaissance and cycling boom manifest themselves particularly in cities, and success stories of cities experimenting with specific types of low-energy mobility abound in the academic literature. Nonetheless, innovation {{is known to be}} a precarious process requiring favorable circumstances. Using document analysis and in-depth interviews, this study examines the nature of low-energy innovation in the everyday mobility of people in two UK cities with favorable conditions for a transition away from fossil fuels—Brighton and Oxford. It shows that clear differences exist between the two cities in the sorts of innovation that emerge and diffuse as a result of path dependencies, local politics, and financial support from supra-local governments and agencies. While low-energy mobility currently has substantial momentum in both cities, the majority of low-carbon innovations in urban mobility are incremental rather than radical in nature, and their future is often imbued with uncertainty. The autonomy of small- and medium-sized cities as agents in bringing about transformational change toward low-energy urban mobility should not be overestimated...|$|E
40|$|Transportation is of key {{importance}} to the ethanol sector, with a typical 100 million gallon per year (MGY) plant receiving the equivalent of 110 truckloads of corn per day while shipping out 34 truckloads of ethanol and 36 truckloads of dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS). Unlike truck movements, shipment by rail requires that an ethanol plant either purchase or lease rail tanker cars to ship ethanol or hopper cars for DDGS. Thus, rail dependent ethanol plants incur an additional fixed cost. While ethanol profitability itself is relatively well studied, the effect of rail equipment costs on profitability is unknown. ^ This study examines the effect of rail equipment costs on dry-grind corn ethanol profitability. To estimate the rail equipment cost, linear programming (LP) models allocated flows of ethanol to blenders and DDGS to feeders. The LP model results were combined with plant size characteristics to estimate the number of rail cars required and the associated fixed costs of rail equipment. The number of rail cars depends on the distance to market and whether the shipment is by unit train or single <b>car</b> <b>rail.</b> Rail equipment costs were then added to an ethanol plant profitability model based on Eidman (2007). ^ Results first suggest that rail equipment leasing costs decrease profits by 7. 7 percent across all ethanol plants. However, rail dependent ethanol plants most likely factor in this additional cost {{as part of a}} bid price to distant markets to recoup the cost. Second, plants in the 51 to 100 MGY size range are more rail dependent than ethanol plants over 100 MGY. On average, 60 percent of plants have a rail requirement for shipping either ethanol or DDGS, while 40 percent of the ethanol plants are truck houses. Finally, results show that 42 percent of ethanol and 48 percent of DDGS move by rail from the six largest ethanol and DDGS producing states. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 This study {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} the 1980 Staggers Rail Act (SRA) on Pacific Northwest (Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana) wheat transportation. A minimum cost uncapacitated transshipment network flow model is employed to simulate the origination and destination pattern of grain flows before (1977) and after (1985) the SRA. The grain transportation flow for those two years is compared and analyzed as a basis for measuring the impact of rail deregulation. The Transportation Simplex Algorithm is used to find the optimum (minimal cost) wheat transportation flow for the two time periods. Four modes of transportation—truck, barge, rail, and ocean carriers—are used to link a sample of inland grain elevators (source), barge terminals (transshipment), PNW ports on the Lower Columbia River and Puget Sound (transshipment), and foreign countries (sink). The empirical results indicate that the SRA has {{had a significant impact on}} modal distribution, overall transportation costs, and rate competition. Under the assumption of perfect information and profit maximizing behavior, and considering both single car and multicar rates, two-thirds of the total PNW wheat traffic should have moved by rail in 1985. This represents a significant increase compared to 1977, when this percentage was estimated at only 46. 43 percent. This increase in rail modal share has come at the expense of truck-barge shipments. The truck-barge share of wheat transportation declined from 47. 53 percent in 1977 to 25. 66 percent in 1985. Most of this increase in rail shipment is the result of lower shipping costs offered through multicar rates. If only single <b>car</b> <b>rail</b> rates are considered in 1985, the rail market share is only 25. 66 percent; while truckbarge market share is 66. 60 percent. The volume of wheat exported through the Lower Columbia River ports and Puget Sound appears not to have been affected by the SRA. Overall wheat transportation cost decreased significantly over this time interval. In nominal terms, it cost an average of 5. 32 percent less in 1985 than in 1977 to transport a metric ton of PNW wheat to the port terminals on the west coast. When adjusted for inflation, average wheat transportation cost decreased around 44 percent. Sensitivity analysis showed that the wheat transportation market in the PNW has been very competitive since 1977 with some apparent changes in market behavior. First, railroads had a greater ability in 1985 than in 1977, to capture wheat traffic from truck-barge by lowering rates. When rail rates are reduced by one percent, rail traffic increases 7. 93 percent in the 1985 model and only 2. 40 percent in the 1977 model. Rail rate increases, on the other hand, lead to higher traffic losses in 1977 than in 1985. For an increase of one percent in rail rates, rail traffic decreased 10. 21 percent in 1977, and only 4. 76 percent in 1985. The conclusion of this study is that there has been a significant diversion of wheat traffic from truck-barge to rail, during the period of rail deregulation. Overall transportation costs have also decreased, and the railroads ability to capture wheat traffic by reducing rates has been enhanced. It is concluded that {{the impact of the}} SRA on PNW wheat transportation is due largely to the introduction of multicar rates by the railroads serving the region. The implications of these findings are that railroad deregulation has provided many of the benefits expected by this legislation. Shippers are favored by the SRA because they are paying lower transportation costs. Railroads have benefited, to the extent that their market share has increased. Barge companies, however, have been adversely influenced by the SRA because they have lost their modal share of wheat traffic to railroads. Shippers, while benefiting from lower rates, seems now more vulnerable to the potential for future rail rate increases...|$|E
