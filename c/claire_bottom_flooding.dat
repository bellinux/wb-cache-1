25|$|After the war, Indiana was {{acquired}} by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, which utilized her from New York to South America {{as well as in}} the Northwest. On April 4, 1909, Indiana was grounded off Cape Tosco, Isla Santa Margarita, Mexico. The accident tore out the ship's <b>bottom,</b> <b>flooding</b> her three holds and engine compartment to a depth of about sixteen feet. Fortunately, passengers, cargo and crew were safely removed. The vessel's wreckage was subsequently sold for $5,000 salvage, bringing to an end a long and varied 36-year career.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{covers the}} results of VVER core reflooding studies in fuel {{assembly}} (FA) mockup of 126 fuel rod simulators with axial power peaking. The experiments were performed for two types of flooding. The first type is top flooding of the empty (steamed) FA mockup. The second type is <b>bottom</b> <b>flooding</b> of the FA mockup with level of boiling water. The test parameters are as follows: {{the range of the}} supplied power to the bundle is from 40 to 320 [*]kW, the cooling water flow rate is from 0. 04 to 1. 1 [*]kg/s, the maximum temperature of the fuel rod simulator is 800 [*]°C and the linear heat flux is from 0. 1 to 1. 0 [*]kW/m. The test results were used for computer code validation...|$|R

All cases were from southeast Iowa where many river <b>bottoms</b> were <b>flooded</b> {{for an extended period}} of time last year and growers were forced to plant soybean even though their plan was to plant corn. To get back into their field rotations this year soybean would need to be planted after soybean. Is that a problem...|$|R
50|$|The {{draining}} of {{the land}} did little to prevent the flat area on the Missouri River <b>bottoms</b> from <b>flooding</b> from the streams that emptied into the area. In 1908 two years after its completion the land was flooded. In 1915 in a flood that {{was said to be}} worse than the Great Flood of 1881 which had been an incentive for draining the land indundated much of land.|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} contains {{information on}} establishing a black walnut plantation. Based on current market conditions, $ 20, 000 to $ 30, 000 worth of black walnut timber can be harvested from a managed acre within 50 years. The {{total cost of}} establishing an acre rarely exceeds $ 100, including site preparation, cost of seedlings, planting, and weed control. The decision {{to invest in a}} walnut plantation can be based on: 1. The rate of return on $ 100 per acre invested is 11. 3 percent to 11. 9 percent, yielding $ 20, 000 to $ 30, 000 within 50 years. The same investment at 6 percent interest would yield $ 1, 842 at the end of 50 years. 2. Ideal sites are stream <b>bottoms,</b> <b>flood</b> plains, or odd corners. Such areas may be placed in walnut production with little or no loss of agricultural production. 3. Historically, walnut has increased in value faster than the inflation rate. Using present market figures probably greatly underestimates the future market value...|$|R
50|$|Drum hoists {{require less}} routine {{maintenance}} than a friction hoist, because the haulage cable is {{fixed to the}} drum, and therefore have less downtime, and the maintenance regime is less sophisticated. Drum hoists can continue to operate if the shaft <b>bottom</b> gets <b>flooded</b> and less shaft depth is required below the loading pocket, unlike friction hoists where such flooding could cover the tail ropes and so on. Because drum hoists do not have tail ropes, the hoisting system is more suited to slinging beneath a conveyance.|$|R
50|$|The {{hospital}} and the area around it flooded {{in the aftermath of}} Hurricane Katrina in 2005, rendering the hospital an island with the <b>bottom</b> floor <b>flooded,</b> with no electricity or other utilities after the emergency generators failed because they were located in the hospital's flooded basement. The hospital was closed after the surviving patients and staff were able to be evacuated after several days. The hospital remained closed through 2005 and into 2006, and management discussed demolishing the main hospital buildings rather than refurbishing them.|$|R
5|$|Hurricane {{was bombed}} and sunk in a German air raid on Liverpool {{during the night}} of 7/8 May 1941. She {{was struck by a}} bomb that passed through the hull and detonated {{underneath}} her. The explosion blew a large hole in her <b>bottom</b> and <b>flooded</b> her engine room and oil tanks. The ship's structure was badly damaged enough that her stern began to sag downwards and Hurricane was moved to Bidston Dock lest she sink and block traffic in the harbour. No one was killed in the attack, although a few crewmen received minor injuries.|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{hydraulic}} and SFD (Severe Fuel Damage) {{best estimate}} computer modelling code SOCRAT/V 3 {{was used for}} the calculation of QUENCH-LOCA- 0 experiment. The new QUENCH-LOCA bundle tests with different cladding materials will simulate a representative scenario of the LOCA (Loss of Coolant Accident) nuclear power plant accident sequence in which the overheated up to 1300 K reactor core would be reflooded from the bottom by ECCS (Emergency Core Cooling System). The first test QUENCH-LOCA- 0 was successfully conducted at the KIT, Karlsruhe, Germany, in July 22, 2010, and was performed as the commissioning test for this series. The test bundle was made up of 21 fuel rod simulators which are placed in the square set. Heating is carried out electrically using tungsten heaters. The rod claddings are identical to that used in PWRs. The bundle was electrically heated in steam from 900 K to 1300 K with the heat-up rate of 2. 2 K/s. After cooling in the saturated steam the <b>bottom</b> <b>flooding</b> with water flow rate of 90 g/s was initiated. The calculated results are in a good agreement with experimental data taking into account additional quenching due to water condensate entrainment at the steam cooling stage. SOCRAT/V 3 was used for estimation of further steps in experimental procedure to reach a representative LOCA scenario in future tests...|$|R

Why, Jeff, look outside,' she winds up, peeping through a chink between the logs. I opened the little wooden window and looked out. The entire river <b>bottom</b> was <b>flooded,</b> and the knob of land on which the house stood was an island {{in the middle of a}} rushing stream of yellow water a hundred yards wide. And it was still raining hard. All we could do was to stay there till the doves brought in the olive branch.|$|R
5000|$|John Hilger, {{an early}} {{resident}} of Pierre, South Dakota described the flood, saying, “When the snow started to disappear, it {{left in a}} hurry. The river rose very rapidly, the ice gorged a short distance below town, turning the water into the <b>bottoms</b> and <b>flooded</b> the town with from four to six feet of water. Those who were not so fortunate as to possess two story houses were obliged to retreat to higher ground. My dugout was filled with {{women and children and}} I was obliged to seek quarters elsewhere {{because of the lack of}} room.” ...|$|R

50|$|The town {{is home to}} Woodford Primary School. The school {{opened on}} the midnight of 30 April and 1 May 1854. Back then, the school was small; it was {{relocated}} to the hill further north 100 years after its opening. In late August 2001, the <b>bottom</b> flat was <b>flooded</b> after heavy rain. The school closed the day afterwards before re-opening after the water receded.|$|R
25|$|At their start, slums are {{typically}} located in least desirable lands {{near the town}} or city, that are state owned or philanthropic trust owned or religious entity owned or have no clear land title. In cities located over a mountainous terrain, slums begin on difficult to reach slopes or start at the <b>bottom</b> of <b>flood</b> prone valleys, often hidden from plain view of city center but close to some natural water source. In cities located near lagoons, marshlands and rivers, they start at banks or on stilts above water or the dry river bed; in flat terrain, slums begin on lands unsuitable for agriculture, near city trash dumps, next to railway tracks, and other shunned undesirable locations.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the Civil War Upham began {{marketing}} patriotic items to support the Union, and novelty items mocking the Confederacy, such as cards depicting the head of Jefferson Davis on the body of a jackass. In February 1862, he acquired a sample of Confederate money and quickly started producing his own counterfeits. His first printing consisted of 3,000 five-dollar notes, each stamped at the bottom with the words, [...] "Fac-simile Confederate Note - Sold wholesale and retail by S.C. Upham 403 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia." [...] He sold his first batch for a penny per copy. Cotton smugglers in the south quickly began buying Upham's novelty notes, trimming off the notice at the <b>bottom</b> and <b>flooding</b> the Confederate economy with the bogus bills.|$|R
40|$|The {{excessive}} {{amount of}} rainfall {{that we have}} received in Iowa over the last 2 months, and particularly the last week, has caused excessive flooding in many areas. River <b>bottoms</b> are completely <b>flooded</b> and will probably {{not be able to}} be planted now for the next 2 to 3 weeks or at all this year. For the majority of the fields the water should drain and dry quickly, barring no more excessive rainfall...|$|R
5000|$|The Nevadas {{were the}} Navys first battleships to have oil {{as their primary}} fuel and the last to use twin-screw {{propulsion}} (all subsequent battleships would use four screws). Oil boasted greater thermal efficiency, allowed greater range per ton of fuel carried (something that would come in handy for Pacific operations, with their logistical supply challenges), and could be taken on while underway (although the technique was not perfected until after World War I), while coal-burning ships could not be refueled except in port, or (with great difficulty) at a dead stop. Oil made it far easier to raise steam, eliminated waste caused by [...] "burning down fires" [...] in port after docking, and did not leave any solid waste {{that needed to be}} frequently manually cleared away as coal did. Smaller boilers could be used, while forced draft and sealed fire rooms, with their corresponding drain of auxiliary power through the use of numerous ventilators, could be eliminated entirely. The subsequent weight and space savings allowed the entire propulsion plant to be combined amidships in a compartment almost the entire inside width of the ship but only 24 m long. The reduced length presented a smaller target area for enemy gunners. Oil also allowed these ships to manage with only one funnel, and reduced the number of stokers by 50 percent. Also, the backbreaking work of constant manual coal shoveling was eliminated. The savings in weight were used for extra armor protection. Side bunkers were omitted completely; fuel was stored in tanks located in the double <b>bottom.</b> <b>Flood</b> control in the event of underwater hits was also improved since there were no coal scuttle doors to spring open and thus compromise watertight integrity.|$|R
50|$|Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, {{which was}} {{formerly}} {{led by the}} Chief Executive, Jim Mackey, was placed first. East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust was at the <b>bottom.</b> <b>Claire</b> Murdoch, chief executive of Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, placed 125th, complained that the league had a “significant methodological flaw in terms of fairness” because it implied that {{there were significant differences}} between ranks 120 and 121, and because, she complained, the assessments were not carried out consistently and the large amount of information trusts reported monthly to the Care Quality Commission were not taken into account.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1960s {{the mine}} was {{producing}} 10000000 carat kg of diamond per year, {{of which a}} relatively high fraction (20%) were of gem quality. The upper layers of the mine (down to 340 metres) had very high diamond content of 4 carat g per tonne of ore, with the relatively high ratio of gems to industrial stones. The yield decreased to about 2 carat g per tonne and the production rate slowed to 2000000 carat kg per year near the pit bottom. The largest diamond of the mine was found on 23 December 1980; it weighed 342.5 carats (68 g) and was named [...] "26th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" [...] (XXVI съезд КПСС). The mine operation was interrupted in the 1990s {{at a depth of}} 340 m after the pit <b>bottom</b> became <b>flooded,</b> but resumed later.|$|R
50|$|Sediment {{discharge}} in river <b>bottoms</b> {{occurs during}} <b>flooding</b> seasons, and {{will cause the}} Gila dace to swim directly into the currents avoiding the spraying of sediment into the gills. If droughts occur, the fish will also seek refuge in wetland areas such as algae mats. They can prevent desiccation by hiding under logs and stones. The wetlands provide detritus, a nutrient that these fish primarily eat, as the fish are omnivorous and opportunistic feeders. They can also feed on invertebrates, zooplankton, {{and other forms of}} algae as the circumstances allow.|$|R
25|$|Slums {{are often}} placed amongs the places {{vulnerable}} to natural disasters such as landslides and floods. In cities located over a mountainous terrain, slums begin on slopes {{difficult to reach}} or start at the <b>bottom</b> of <b>flood</b> prone valleys, often hidden from plain view of city center but close to some natural water source. In cities located near lagoons, marshlands and rivers, they start at banks or on stilts above water or the dry river bed; in flat terrain, slums begin on lands unsuitable for agriculture, near city trash dumps, next to railway tracks, and other shunned, undesirable locations. These strategies shield slums from {{the risk of being}} noticed and removed when they are small and most vulnerable to local government officials. However, the ad hoc construction, lack of quality control on building materials used, poor maintenance, and uncoordinated spatial design make them prone to extensive damage during earthquakes as well from decay.|$|R
5000|$|Between Percy Priest Dam and {{the mouth}} of the Stones River, it flows through Clover <b>Bottom,</b> a large <b>flood</b> plain and site of a former {{plantation}} whose Clover Bottom Mansion house, after many years of disuse, neglect, and vandalism, is now the headquarters for the Tennessee Historical Commission. [...] "Clover Bottom" [...] was once the name of a nearby custodial school for mentally disabled children and adults. The immediate area is also the site of a state mental hospital and the Tennessee School for the Blind. Clover Bottom also is the separation of the Nashville neighborhoods of Donelson and Hermitage.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{the crew}} was alarmed by the thunder-like sound of the waves {{slamming}} against her flat bottom. Reed and Vogak wrote that at times {{it sounded as if}} the ship had hit a hard rock. Around 10 a.m. of the next day the hull cracked, the space between inner and outer <b>bottoms</b> was <b>flooded,</b> and Vogak rushed his ship to a safe anchorage in Ferrol. The divers discovered a five-meter-long dent and numerous cracks in the fore segment of the hull which were ultimately blamed on waves. Popov concurred and admitted his failure [...] "to foresee the effects of shallow draft". He wrote that the damage had dual mechanism: first, when the flat pontoon pitched above the waves, gravity subjected it to an enormous stress, bending the whole structure down. Next, as it plummeted down, the flat bottom hit water head-on, rupturing the rivets and tearing off the crossbeams. Reed noted that the radial framing pattern chosen by the designers resulted in a strong center section and inadequately weak extremities, and that any experienced shipbuilder should have discovered this weakness in advance.|$|R
