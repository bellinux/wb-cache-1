In {{an interview with}} Noisey's Rebecca Haithcoat, Keef told Haithcoat his favorite part about Los Angeles is, [...] "the quiet." [...] After moving to Los Angeles, Keef began indulging in his new-found hobby of art collecting, once he discovered the paintings of art teacher Bill da Butcher, while in rehab. Once acquainted, da Butcher began working on paintings personally meant for Keef. Keef believed that his move to Los Angeles benefited him; {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Keef stated [...] "I got away from all the unnecessary trouble.

500|$|According to Jessie Schiewe of Respect., {{the lyrics}} also imply that Azalea [...] "was swindled and take {{advantage}} of in her first record deal", and that it provides insight into events that have toughened Azalea up. While Cristina Jaleru of The Associated Press deduced that the lyrics [...] "First deal <b>changed</b> <b>me,</b> robbed blind, basically raped me / Studied the Carters till a deal was offered, slept cold on the floor recording," [...] are rapped [...] "not as a complaint but as a badge of honor". Nick Aveling of Time Out writes that Azalea is depicted as a [...] "hustler" [...] and a [...] "woman with immense ambition" [...] in the song. In a NPR publication, Ann Powers viewed the lyrics to be of [...] "unremitting toil", as well as detailing a story of Azalea [...] "staying up night after night to master her flow". John Lucas of The Georgia Straight compared the lyrical content to that of Drake's [...] "Started from the Bottom" [...] (2013). According to Matt Jost of RapReviews.com, [...] "Work" [...] is similar to the works of 2 Live Crew and is a [...] "nod to Miami's music history".|$|E

I knew exactly what I was going to do. I'm lucky that way." [...] He admits that he never felt cool growing up.

500|$|On {{choosing}} {{his lead}} single, Drake told Rap-Up, [...] "It’s gotta {{be a real}} great song. It’s gotta be something that I feel is timeless and is better than anything that I’ve ever done." [...] Drake exclusively revealed to Rap-Up on February 15, 2010 that [...] "Over" [...] would be the lead single from his debut album, Thank Me Later, and would be produced by Boi-1da, producer of his previous singles [...] "Best I Ever Had" [...] and [...] "Forever". Drake chose to premiere the song on his hometown Toronto's radio station Flow 93.5. In an interview session with the station, Drake said, [...] "I went with 'Over' as the first look because of {{the words in the}} hook," [...] he said. [...] "The hook being the most repetitive part. I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but the biggest thing was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment. I wanted to emerge at first from this album and just let people know 'This is how I'm coming out in the public eye. I'm ready for anything." [...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have <b>changed</b> <b>me</b> drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes and reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment. It's the dark side of things and I really wanted that to come out first." ...|$|E

2500|$|Along with Beatles bandmate John Lennon {{and their}} wives, George Harrison first took the hallucinogenic drug Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in April 1965, when a dentist friend {{slipped it into}} their after-dinner coffee. The {{heightened}} perception induced by the hallucinogen inspired both musicians in their subsequent work with the Beatles, notably on the albums Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and led directly to a shared interest in Eastern philosophical concepts and meditation. Harrison later said of the profound change he felt {{as a result of}} first taking the drug: [...] "I had such an overwhelming feeling of well-being, that there was a God, and I could see him in every blade of grass. It was like gaining hundreds of years of experience within twelve hours. It <b>changed</b> <b>me,</b> {{and there was no way}} back to what I was before." ...|$|E

[...] Stacy London said, [...] "This show <b>changed</b> <b>me</b> and the trajectory of my life... I've learned so much from all of our contributors [...] over the years. I hope we touched them as much as they touched me. I hope we touched our viewers... I will always cherish the time I spent on 'WNTW' and be eternally grateful to TLC for a great co-host, amazing crew and an awesome program." [...] Clinton Kelly said, [...] "When I got the job, I told everyone I knew that we’d probably do 10 episodes, get canceled and I’d go crawling back to my old job in magazine publishing. So, I’m more surprised than anyone that we’ve lasted this long. At first I thought the essence of the show was making snarky remarks about people’s outfits, but as it turns out, 'WNTW' is about taking stock of who you are and communicating that non-verbally {{to the rest of the}} world. That’s incredibly empowering." ...|$|E
