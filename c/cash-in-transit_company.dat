5000|$|In 1983 Oberthur Cash Protection (operating as Axytrans, part of Axytel - {{a company}} {{specialized}} {{in the design}} and manufacture of credit cards and checks) has invented the very first Intelligent Banknote Neutralization System to protect Cash-in-transit using ink as a degradation agent. The invention was made in collaboration with one of Axytrans' customers, a French <b>Cash-in-transit</b> <b>company</b> VALTIS, who was searching for alternative way to protect valuables during Cash-in-transit The product, called ATV (Axytrans Transport de Valeurs) was designed to provide Cash-in-transit companies with an alternative way of transporting valuables. It was first used in 1990 by the Belgium Post for their Cash-in-transit operation. In 1991 French law was modified to allow use of ATV on an experimental basis and the French CIT company VALTIS started using it to service three regional banks. [...] Even though the pilot turned out to be successful the ATV was not well accepted by many CIT companies who argued that firearms and armoring provide better protection to valuables. Nevertheless the company has become very well known in France and Belgium, and up to this date “Axytrans” is often used as a generic term to describe Intelligent Banknote Neutralisation System.|$|E
