40|$|BACKGROUND: Although the vasculoprotective {{effects of}} apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein {{associated}} with high-density lipoprotein, have been universally accepted, apoA-II {{has been suggested}} to have poor antiatherogenic or even proatherogenic properties. To study this suggestion more closely, we evaluated how serum levels of apoA-II and apoA-I relate {{to the risk of}} future coronary artery disease (CAD) in a large, prospective study. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a nested case-control study in the prospective EPIC-Norfolk (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Norfolk) cohort. Case subjects (n= 912) were apparently healthy men and women aged 45 to 79 years who developed fatal or nonfatal CAD during a mean follow-up of 6 years. Control subjects (n= 1635) were matched by age, gender, and enrollment time. Conditional logistic regression was used to quantify the relationship between serum apoA-II levels and risk of CAD. Serum apoA-II concentration was significantly lower in case subjects (34. 5 +/- 6. 3 mg/dL) than in control subjects (35. 2 +/- 5. 8 mg/dL) and was inversely associated with risk of CAD, such that patients in the upper quartile (> 38. 1 mg/dL) had an odds ratio of 0. 59 (95 % confidence interval 0. 46 to 0. 76) versus those in the lowest quartile (< 31. 1 mg/dL; P for linearity < 0. 0001). After adjustment for fasting time, alcohol use, and cardiovascular risk factors (systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, smoking, diabetes mellitus, and C-reactive protein), the corresponding risk estimate was 0. 48 (95 % confidence interval 0. 34 to 0. 67, P for linearity < 0. 0001). Surprisingly, additional adjustment for serum apoA-I levels did not affect risk prediction of apoA-II for future <b>CAD</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> 0. 49, 95 % confidence interval 0. 34 to 0. 68, P for linearity < 0. 0001). Also, after adjustment for high-density lipoprotein particle number and size, apoA-II was still associated with the risk of future <b>CAD</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> 0. 62, 95 % confidence interval 0. 43 to 0. 90, P for linearity 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: ApoA-II is associated with a decreased risk of future CAD in apparently healthy people. These findings imply that apoA-II itself exerts effects on specific antiatherogenic pathways.

The genotype analysis was performed using 5 ’exonuclease TaqMan genotyping assays in a group of 994 patients with premature CAD and 703 controls. A similar genotype distribution of rs 2026458 was observed in both groups; however, under an additive model adjusted by age, body mass index, type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, the rs 9349379 G allele was associated with a higher risk for developing premature <b>CAD</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> (OR) = 1. 22, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 03 – 1. 46, p-value (p) = 0. 024).

Material and. Methods: 83 subjects (age: 57. 1 &plusmn; 6. 9 years) with at least 5 years history of type 2 diabetes, and no suspected or documented coronary artery disease (CAD) accomplished myocardial perfusion imaging; angiography was also performed in patients with abnormal MPI.

While endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are reduced, there is no data on procalcific polarization of circulating progenitors, which may contribute to vascular calcification in these patients. In a cohort of 107 subjects with and without DM and CAD, we analyzed the pro-calcific versus endothelial differentiation status of circulating CD 34 + progenitor cells. Endothelial commitment was determined by expression of VEGFR- 2 (KDR) and pro-calcific polarization by expression of osteocalcin (OC) and bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP). We found that DM patients had significantly higher expression of OC and BAP on circulating CD 34 + cells than control subjects, especially {{in the presence of}} CAD. In patients with DM and <b>CAD,</b> the <b>ratio</b> of OC/KDR, BAP/KDR, and OC+BAP/KDR was about 3 -fold increased than in other groups.

40|$|Objective Circulating {{levels of}} C-reactive protein (CRP) are {{associated}} with an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Observational and experimental evidence suggest that CRP might differentially predict fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Here, we sought to determine the predictive value of CRP for fatal and nonfatal CAD, stroke, or PAD. Approach and Results CRP levels were measured in 18 450 apparently healthy participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) -Norfolk cohort. Cox proportional hazards models were used to quantify the association between CRP levels and fatal and nonfatal CAD events, strokes, and PAD events. Bootstrapping was applied to test for significant differences between the risk of fatal and nonfatal events. During 208 485 person-years at risk, 2915 CAD events, 361 strokes, and 657 PAD events occurred. CRP was associated with fatal and nonfatal CAD events and nonfatal PAD events. When adding CRP to predictive risk models for fatal and nonfatal events corrected for known cardiovascular risk factors, the net reclassification index was 2. 1 % for fatal and 1. 9 % for nonfatal events. Multivariate adjusted hazard <b>ratios</b> for fatal <b>CAD</b> events (hazard <b>ratio,</b> 1. 36; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 27 - 1. 46) differed significantly (mean difference, 13 %; 95 % confidence interval, 5. 1 %- 21. 9 %; P < 0. 001) from the multivariate adjusted hazard <b>ratio</b> for nonfatal <b>CAD</b> events (hazard <b>ratio,</b> 1. 21; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 15 - 1. 26). Conclusions In the EPIC-Norfolk cohort, CRP was associated with fatal and nonfatal CAD events, as well as nonfatal PAD events. Adding CRP to risk stratification models resulted in a small improvement in classification for both fatal and nonfatal events.

We {{examined}} {{whether the}} variant at chromosome 9 p 21, rs 4977574, {{was associated with}} long-term cardiovascular mortality in Han Chinese patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Methodology. Subjects who underwent coronary angiography for chest pain were consecutively enrolled. Fasting blood samples were collected for laboratory and genotype assessments. The information was correlated with data collected from the national death database. Results. There were 925 cases with CAD and 634 without CAD enrolled in the present study. The G allele conferred {{a significant increase in}} risk of <b>CAD</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> = 1. 47, P = 0. 003 in the dominant model; odds ratio = 1. 36, P = 0. 018 in the recessive model). During a median of 11 years (inter-quartile range between 5. 2 and 12. 5 years) of follow-up, neither the total nor the cardiovascular mortality was different among CAD subjects with different genotypes. Using Cox regression analysis, genotypes of rs 4977574 still failed to predict cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio = 1. 25, P = 0. 138 in the dominant model; hazard ratio = 1. 05, P = 0. 729 in the recessive model).

We used an established, national, observational cohort of all HCV-infected veterans receiving care at all Veterans Affairs facilities, the Electronically Retrieved Cohort of HCV Infected Veterans, to identify HCV-infected subjects and HCV-uninfected control subjects. We used the Cox proportional-hazards model to determine the risk of CAD among HCV-infected subjects and control subjects. Results. We identified 82, 083 HCV-infected and 89, 582 HCV-uninfected subjects. HCV-infected subjects {{were less likely to}} have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes but were more likely to abuse alcohol and drugs and to have renal failure and anemia.

In total 885 patients with suspected CAD underwent CTA and were stratified to moderate CKD (85 patients) or no CKD (770 patients) based on a cut-off estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m(2). After 896 days of follow-up, 42 patients developed CV events. Annualized CV event rates were 1. 2 % in patients with no CKD and no CAD, 2. 5 % in patients with moderate CKD alone, 2. 5 % in patients with obstructive CAD alone, and 3. 7 % in those with moderate CKD and obstructive CAD. Multivariate models demonstrated that moderate CKD (hazard ratio 2. 39, confidence interval 1. 09 to 5. 21, p = 0. 03) and obstructive <b>CAD</b> (hazard <b>ratio</b> 2. 76, confidence interval 1. 40 to 5. 44, p < 0. 01) were independent predictors of CV events.

40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) independently associates {{with an increased}} risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), but it has not been fully investigated whether this co-morbidity involves shared pathophysiological mechanisms. To identify potential common pathways across the two diseases, we tested all recently published single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with human lung function (spirometry) for association with carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in 3, 378 subjects with multiple CAD risk factors, and for association with CAD in a case-control study of 5, 775 CAD cases and 7, 265 controls. SNPs rs 2865531, located in the CFDP 1 gene, and rs 9978142, located in the KCNE 2 gene, were significantly associated with CAD. In addition, SNP rs 9978142 and SNP rs 3995090 located in the HTR 4 gene, were associated with average and maximal cIMT measures. Genetic risk scores combining the most robustly spirometry-associated SNPs from the literature were modestly associated with <b>CAD,</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> (OR) (95 % confidence interval (CI 95)  = 1. 06 (1. 03, 1. 09); P-value = 1. 5 × 10 (- 4), per allele).

40|$|Background: Multi-marker {{approaches}} for risk prediction in {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) have been inconsistent due to biased selection of specific know biomarkers. We have assessed the global proteome of CAD-affected and unaffected subjects, and developed a pathway network model for elucidating the mechanism and risk prediction for CAD. Materials and Methods: A total of 252 samples (112 CAD-affected without family history and 140 true controls) were analyzed by Surface-Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) by using CM 10 cationic chips and bioinformatics tools. Results: Out of 36 significant peaks in SELDI-TOF MS, nine peaks could do better discrimination of CAD subjects and controls (area under the curve (AUC) of 0. 963) based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) feature selection method.

The aim of this study was to define which clinical parameters or non-invasive tests predict CAD in asymptomatic {{type 2 diabetic}} patients. Methods: One hundred fourteen asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients were divided into two groups based on the number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (group A ≥ 2, group B ≤ 1). Treadmill exercise ECG tests (TMT) were conducted in all cases, and coronary artery angiography was performed on TMT-positive patients. Clinical parameters, diabetic status, and coronary angiographic findings were analyzed. Results: The prevalence of CAD was 41. 0 % in group A and 16. 7 % in group B. The number of risk factors was significantly correlated with the prevalence of CAD, but not with the severity of CAD. Multivariate analysis showed that family history of <b>CAD</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> [OR]= 9. 41; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 60 - 55. 49) and diabetes duration ≥ 10 years (OR= 3. 28; 95 % CI, 1. 29 - 8. 84) were independent CAD risk factors in asymptomatic patients.

40|$|AIM : To assess {{platelet}} activation in south Indian {{type 2 diabetic}} subjects with and without CAD. METHODS : Four groups of subjects were studied; Group 1 comprised of non-diabetic subjects without coronary artery disease (CAD) (n = 30). Type 2 diabetic subjects without CAD formed Group 2 (n = 30); Group 3 comprised of type 2 diabetic subjects with CAD (n = 30) and Group 4 consisted of non- diabetic subjects with CAD (n= 14).

The relative contribution of genetic background, HIV-related factors, antiretroviral medications, and traditional risk factors to CAD has not been fully evaluated {{in the setting of}} HIV infection. Methods. In the general population, 23 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were shown to be associated with CAD through genome-wide association analysis. Using the metabochip, we genotyped 1875 HIV-positive, white individuals enrolled in 24 HIV observational studies, including 571 participants with a first CAD event during the 9 -year study period and 1304 controls matched on gender and cohort. Results. A genetic risk score built from 23 CAD-associated SNPs contributed significantly to CAD (P= 2. 9 x 10 - 4). In the final, multivariable model, participants with an unfavorable genetic background (top genetic score quartile) had a <b>CAD</b> odds <b>ratio</b> (OR) of 1. 47 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 05 - 2. 04). This effect was similar to hypertension (OR= 1. 36; 95 % CI, 1. 06 - 1. 73), hypercholesterolemia (OR= 1. 51; 95 % CI, 1. 16 - 1. 96), diabetes (OR= 1. 66; 95 % [ [...] . ] ROTGER, Margalida, et al.

40|$|Previous studies {{examined}} the serum immunoglobulin levels {{in relation to}} coronary artery disease (CAD). We hypothesized that the salivary immunoglobulins might better estimate oral infections in this relationship. Multivariate logistic regression analyses utilizing the data from 256 angiographically confirmed CAD patients and 250 non-CAD individuals that controlled for age, sex, smoking, diabetes, total/HDL cholesterol ratio, hypertension, and education revealed the trends that salivary IgA was positively and salivary IgG was inversely associated with <b>CAD.</b> The odds <b>ratios</b> (OR) of each increasing quartile of salivary IgA were 1. 00 (first and second quartiles combined), 1. 97, and 1. 37 (p-value for trend = 0. 06), while those for salivary IgG were 1. 00, 0. 77, 0. 60, and 0. 51 (p-value for trend = 0. 02).

40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is a major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in modern society. Known risk factors for coronary artery disease include dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, dysglycemia, insulin resistance, inflammation, arterial intimal thickening, development of vulnerable plaque and thrombosis. This study compared lipid parameters in CAD patients with healthy individuals to see the predictive power of lipid parameters. Results show that a significant number of CAD patients have abnormal lipid profile. LDL-Cholesterol and Apo-B were significantly higher in CAD patients compared to healthy controls. HDL-Cholesterol and Apo A- 1 were significantly decreased in <b>CAD</b> patients. The <b>ratio</b> of Apo B/Apo A- 1 is highly significant in CAD patients. To conclude Apo A- 1 and Apo-B are better predictors of CAD risk in general, and Apo- B/Apo A- 1 ratio seems to be a more powerful predictor of CAD risk than individual apolipoprotein and it can be measured routinely along with lipid profile in the screening of CAD risk...|$|R
40|$|Background—Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} that the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) TaqIB gene polymorphism is associated with HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels {{and the risk of}} coronary artery disease (CAD), but the results are inconsistent. In addition, an interaction has been implicated between this genetic variant and pravastatin treatment, but this has not been confirmed. Methods and Results—A meta-analysis was performed on individual patient data from 7 large, population-based studies (each 500 individuals) and 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, pravastatin trials. Linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the relation between TaqIB genotype and HDL-C levels and CAD risk. After adjustment for study, age, sex, smoking, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, LDL-C, use of alcohol, and prevalence of CAD, TaqIB genotype exhibited a highly significant association with HDL-C levels, such that B 2 B 2 individuals had 0. 11 mmol/L (0. 10 to 0. 12, P 0. 0001) higher HDL-C levels than did B 1 B 1 individuals. Second, after adjustment for study, sex, age, smoking, BMI, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, LDL-C, and use of alcohol, TaqIB genotype was significantly associated with the risk of <b>CAD</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> 0. 78 [0. 66 to 0. 93]) in B 2 B 2 individuals compared with B 1 B 1 individuals (P for linearity 0. 008). Additional adjustment for HDL-C levels rendered a loss of statistical significance (P 0. 4). Last, no pharmacogenetic interaction between TaqIB genotype and pravastatin treatment could be demonstrated.

Methods and Results—Results of the metabolic study (study 1) conducted on 185 healthy men indicate that a large proportion (. 80 %) of men with waist circumference values $ 90 cm and with elevated TG levels ($ 2. 0 mmol/L) were characterized by the atherogenic metabolic triad. Validation of the model in an angiographic study (study 2) on a sample of 287 men with and without coronary artery disease (CAD) revealed that only men with both elevated waist and TG levels were at increased risk of <b>CAD</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> of 3. 6, P, 0. 03) compared with men with low waist and TG levels. Conclusions—It is suggested that the simultaneous measurement and interpretation of waist circumference and fasting TG could be used as inexpensive screening tools to identify men characterized by the atherogenic metabolic triad (hyperinsulinemia, elevated apo B, small, dense LDL) and at high risk for CAD.

40|$|An initial major adverse cardiac event (MACE) is an {{important}} predictor of future cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We sought to identify factors influencing occurrence of initial MACE in new maintenance hemodialysis patients without previous cardiac symptoms during the predialysis phase of CKD. Among 112 participating patients with no predialysis cardiac history, 57 underwent coronary angiography, whereas the other 55 underwent stress thallium- 201 single-photon emission computed tomography within 1 month of beginning hemodialysis to detect asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). In subsequent follow-up for a median of 24 months, subjects experiencing an initial MACE were compared with {{those who did not}} have such an event based on several clinical parameters at the end of predialysis phase. Asymptomatic CAD was present in 47 patients (42 %), who had a higher cumulative MACE rate, than subjects without CAD (49 vs 3 %, P< 0. 001). Multivariate Cox's regression analysis showed that three variables independently predicted initial MACE: asymptomatic <b>CAD</b> (hazard <b>ratio</b> or HR, 611. 31; 95 % confidence interval or CI, 14. 07 – 26549. 23; P< 0. 001), diabetes (HR, 20. 41; 95 % CI, 2. 07 – 200. 00; P= 0. 010), and each 1 mg/l increment in C-reactive protein (CRP) (HR, 1. 94; 95 % CI, 1. 27 – 2. 94; P= 0. 002).

BACKGROUNDA total of 435 women with chest pain underwent a diagnostic battery including coronary angiography {{in order to improve}} testing guidelines for women with suspected CAD. METHODSWomen referred for coronary angiography completed questionnaires assessing prior treatment history for anxiety disorder and current anxiety-related symptoms. Analyses controlled for standard CAD risk factors. RESULTSForty-four women (10 %) reported receiving prior treatment for an anxiety disorder. This group acknowledged significantly higher levels of autonomic symptoms (e. g., headaches, muscle tension [F = 25. 0, p < 0. 001] and higher behavioral avoidance scores (e. g., avoidance of open places or traveling alone by bus [F = 4. 2, p < 0. 05]) at baseline testing compared with women without prior anxiety problems. Women with an anxiety-disorder history did not differ from those without such a history with respect to the presence of inducible ischemia or use of nitroglycerin, although they were younger and more likely to describe both “tight” and “sharp” chest pain symptoms and to experience back pain and episodes of nocturnal chest pain. Logistic regression results indicated that the positive-anxiety-history group was more likely to be free of underlying significant angiographic <b>CAD</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> = 2. 74, 95 % confidence interval 1. 15 to 6. 5, p = 0. 03). CONCLUSIONSAmong women with chest pain symptoms, a history of anxiety disorders is associated with a lower probability of significant angiographic CAD.

40|$|Background—Common {{variation}} at chromosome 9 p 21 (marked by rs 10757278 or rs 1333049) {{is associated}} with coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral vascular disease. A decreasing effect at older age was suggested, and effects on long-term mortality are unclear. We estimated 9 p 21 associations with CAD and all-cause mortality in a CAD diagnosis–free older population. We also estimated classification gains on adding the variant to the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) for CAD. Methods and Results—DNA was from an Established Populations for Epidemiological Study of the Elderly–Iowa cohort from 1988 (participants 71 years), with death certificates obtained to 2008 for 92 % of participants. Cox regression models were adjusted for confounders and CAD risk factors. Of 1095 CAD diagnosis–free participants, 52 % were heterozygous (CG) and 22 % were homozygous (CC) for the risk C allele rs 1333049. Unadjusted CAD-attributed death rates in the CC group were 30 vs 22 per 1000 person-years for the GG group. The C allele was associated with all-cause (hazard ratio, 1. 19; 95 % CI, 1. 08 – 1. 30) and <b>CAD</b> (hazard <b>ratio,</b> 1. 29; 95 % CI, 1. 08 – 1. 56) mortality, independent of CAD risk factors. There was no association with stroke deaths. Variant associations with CAD mortality were attenuated {{after the age of}} 80 years (age-interaction term P 0. 05). In age group 71 to 80 years, FRS classified as high risk 21 % of respondents who died of CAD within 10 years; adding 9 p 21 identified 27 % of respondents.

40|$|Background—Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a {{secretory}} glycoprotein {{that belongs}} to the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. OPG-deficient mice develop severe osteoporosis and medial arterial calcification of the aorta and renal arteries. OPG immunoreactivity was demonstrated in the normal blood vessels and in early atherosclerotic lesions. A recent clinical study {{suggests that there is}} a significant correlation between elevated serum OPG levels and cardiovascular mortality. We examined whether serum OPG levels are associated with the progression of coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods and Results—Serum OPG levels were examined in 201 patients who underwent coronary angiography because of stable chest pain. The number of diseased vessels was used to represent the severity of CAD. Serum OPG levels were measured by ELISA and were significantly greater in patients with significant stenosis of the coronary arteries than in those without stenosis. As the severity of CAD increased, there was a significant increase in serum OPG levels. Serum OPG levels were 0. 940. 34, 1. 040. 38, 1. 190. 38, and 1. 440. 54 ng/mL (medians 0. 91, 0. 99, 1. 09, and 1. 37) for the subjects with normal coronary arteries or luminal irregularities, 1 -vessel disease, 2 -vessel disease, and 3 -vessel disease, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that serum OPG levels were significantly associated with the presence of <b>CAD</b> [odds <b>ratio,</b> 5. 2; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 7 to 16. 0].

Here we investigated whether the plasma soluble form of DPP 4 is associated with the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). A cross-sectional study was conducted of 496 aged 26 - 81 years with (n = 362) and without (n = 134) CAD. Plasma DPP 4 activity, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein levels were measured. The coronary atherosclerotic plaques were evaluated by coronary angiography. The CAD patients with (n = 84) and without (n = 278) DM had significantly higher DPP 4 levels (11. 8 ± 3. 1 vs. 6. 9 ± 3. 5 ng/mL, P< 0. 01) than the nonCAD subjects. The acute coronary syndrome patients (n = 299) had elevated DPP 4 levels than those with stable angina patients (n = 83). CAD patients even without DM had increased plasma DPP 4 activities as compared with nonCAD subjects (10. 9 ± 4. 9 vs. 6. 4 ± 3. 1, ng/L, P< 0. 01).

Less {{is known about the}} implications of common genetic variation in the LDLR gene regarding the variability of cholesterol levels and risk of CAD. Imputed genotype data at the LDLR locus on 1 644 individuals of a population-based sample were explored for association with LDL-C level. Replication of association with LDL-C level was sought for the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the LDLR gene in three European samples comprising 6 642 adults and 533 children. Association of this SNP with CAD was examined in six case-control studies involving more than 15 000 individuals. Each copy of the minor T allele of SNP rs 2228671 within LDLR (frequency 11 %) was related to a decrease of LDL-C levels by 0. 19 mmol/L (95 % confidence interval (CI) [0. 13 - 0. 24] mmol/L, p = 1. 5 x 10 (- 10)). This association with LDL-C was uniformly found in children, men, and women of all samples studied.

The relative contribution of genetic background, HIV-related factors, antiretroviral medications, and traditional risk factors to CAD has not been fully evaluated {{in the setting of}} HIV infection. In the general population, 23 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were shown to be associated with CAD through genome-wide association analysis. Using the Metabochip, we genotyped 1875 HIV-positive, white individuals enrolled in 24 HIV observational studies, including 571 participants with a first CAD event during the 9 -year study period and 1304 controls matched on sex and cohort. A genetic risk score built from 23 CAD-associated SNPs contributed significantly to CAD (P = 2. 9 × 10 (- 4)). In the final multivariable model, participants with an unfavorable genetic background (top genetic score quartile) had a <b>CAD</b> odds <b>ratio</b> (OR) of 1. 47 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 05 - 2. 04). This effect was similar to hypertension (OR = 1. 36; 95 % CI, 1. 06 - 1. 73), hypercholesterolemia (OR = 1. 51; 95 % CI, 1. 16 - 1. 96), diabetes (OR = 1. 66; 95 % CI, 1. 10 - 2. 49), ≥ 1 year lopinavir exposure (OR = 1. 36; 95 % CI, 1. 06 - 1. 73), and current abacavir treatment (OR = 1. 56; 95 % CI, 1. 17 - 2. 07).

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{nature and}} {{underlying}} mechanisms of an inverse association between adult height {{and the risk}} of coronary artery disease (CAD) are unclear. METHODS We used a genetic approach to investigate the association between height and CAD, using 180 height-associated genetic variants. We tested the association between a change in genetically determined height of 1 SD (6. 5 cm) with the risk of CAD in 65, 066 cases and 128, 383 controls. Using individual-level genotype data from 18, 249 persons, we also examined the risk of CAD associated with the presence of various numbers of height-associated alleles. To identify putative mechanisms, we analyzed whether genetically determined height was associated with known cardiovascular risk factors and performed a pathway analysis of the height-associated genes. RESULTS We observed a relative increase of 13. 5 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 5. 4 to 22. 1; P < 0. 001) in the risk of CAD per 1 -SD decrease in genetically determined height. There was a graded relationship between the presence of an increased number of height-raising variants and a reduced risk of <b>CAD</b> (odds <b>ratio</b> for height quar-tile 4 versus quartile 1, 0. 74; 95 % CI, 0. 68 to 0. 84; P < 0. 001). Of the 12 risk factors that we studied, we observed significant associations only with levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides (accounting for approximately 30 % of the association). We identified several overlapping pathways involving genes associated with both development and atherosclerosis. CONCLUSIONS There is a primary association between a genetically determined shorter height and an increased risk of CAD, a link that is partly explained by the association between shorter height and an adverse lipid profile.
