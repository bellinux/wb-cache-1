Hence, {{it is of}} particular interest to remove the chips quickly and completely out of the workspace. The application of air streams is one appropriate way to achieve this result. The paper shows the simulation results by using two-phase airflow models. In a first step, the airflow is calculated using FEM/CMD-software. In a following step, the calculation of the trajectories <b>of</b> the <b>chips</b> is made. Some experimental and numerical results are presented.

40|$|This work aims to {{investigate}} the stability of aerobic granular sludge in the long term, focusing on the <b>clogging</b> <b>of</b> the granular sludge porosity exerted by the extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). The effects of different cycle lengths (short and long-term cycle) on the granular sludge stability were investigated. Results obtained outlined that during the short duration cycle, the formation and breakage of the aerobic granules were continuously observed. During this period, the excess of EPS production contributed to the <b>clogging</b> <b>of</b> the granules porosity, causing their breakage in the long run. During the long-duration cycle, the extended famine period entailed a greater EPSs consumption by bacteria, thus limiting the <b>clogging</b> <b>of</b> the porosity, and allowed obtaining stable aerobic granules.

40|$|International audienceThe {{transport}} of suspensions of microparticles in confined environments {{is associated with}} complex phenomena at the interface of fluid mechanics and soft matter. Indeed, the deposition and assembly of particles under flow involve hydrodynamic, steric and colloidal forces, {{and can lead to}} the <b>clogging</b> <b>of</b> microchannels. The formation <b>of</b> <b>clogs</b> dramatically alters the performance of both natural and engineered systems, effectively limiting the use of microfluidic technology. While the fouling of porous filters has been studied at the macroscopic level, it is only recently that the formation <b>of</b> <b>clogs</b> has been considered at the pore-scale, using microfluidic devices. In this review, we present the clogging mechanisms recently reported for suspension flows of colloidal particles and for biofluids in microfluidic channels, including sieving, bridging and aggregation of particles.

40|$|Permeable {{interlocking}} {{concrete pavements}} (PICPs) are being increasingly utilised in urban developments globally to promote stormwater infiltration, reduce catchment runoff volumes {{and to improve}} the quality of downstream receiving waters. However, <b>clogging</b> <b>of</b> PICPs due to the sediment contained in stormwater runoff has been shown to significantly reduce the infiltration capacity of PICPs over time. There have been numerous PICP clogging studies undertaken in the past. Many of these studies have used laboratory-based PICP models, using synthetic stormwater, in an attempt to replicate and predict the clogging processes that occur in PICP field installations. A variety of sediment types and sizes, and stormwater application rates have been used in these studies with mixed results. The current study investigated the effects that varying sediment types, varying particle size distributions and varying testing durations had on <b>clogging</b> <b>of</b> PICP models. Eighteen specially constructed PICP models were tested in the laboratory using the accelerated semi-synthetic stormwater simulation technique. Three different sediment types were tested: 1) specialised silica sand; 2) real stormwater sediment < 300 μm and; 3) real stormwater sediment < 1. 18 mm. Six different stormwater application rates (intensities) were tested in the study. The study results generally indicated that silica sediment clogging processes were inversely proportional to the stormwater application rate. That is, lower application rates (longer test duration) resulted in less <b>clogging</b> <b>of</b> the PICP models. Conversely, for the real sediment < 300 μm, the clogging processes were directly proportional to the stormwater application rate, i. e., lower application rates (longer test duration) resulted in more <b>clogging</b> <b>of</b> the PICP models. Stormwater application rates did not appear to effect the <b>clogging</b> results <b>of</b> real sediment < 1. 18 mm. The study results have revealed new insights into the reliability and validity <b>of</b> laboratory-based PICP <b>clogging</b> testing results and how the results should be viewed...|$|R
