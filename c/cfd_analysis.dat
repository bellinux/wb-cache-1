40|$|Currently, carbon {{footprint}} (<b>CF)</b> <b>analysis</b> is gaining a role of primary interest within the extensive literature regarding wine sustainability issues. It envisages the quantification {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions that underpin the life-cycle of wine, from viticulture and vinification to wine bottling, distribution, consumption and waste end-of-life. This critical review pursues several methodological and conceptual issues behind wine {{carbon footprint}}ing, such as calculation approaches, labeling and standardization purposes, combinations with other methods and theories, and CF trends in the wine sector. Most studies have only addressed specific methodological issues from an attributional life-cycle perspective, or have directly reported the CF profile of a given wine product. Future studies, however, {{will have to deal}} with increasingly complex market interactions linked to the entire life cycle of wine-making.

At the ENEA research center, {{in collaboration with}} IPPLM, an equipment {{has been set up}} to qualitatively and quantitatively determine the chemical composition of impurities deposited on Plasma Facing Components (PFC). The strength of the LIBS, for its capability of light elements detection, is fully exploited to determine the deuterium content since this element can be considered as the best choice proxy for tritium; the latter being is of great importance in assessing safe conditions to assure the continuous operation in nuclear fusion tokamak. Here we present the results of the Double Pulse LIBS (DP-LIBS) probing of deuterated samples with the simultaneous optical detection by medium-resolution and high-resolution spectrometer. Deuterium emission at 656. 1 nm has been detected then the elemental composition has been quantified by applying the Calibration Free (CF) approach.

It includes community based natural resource management through programs/projects emphasizing biodiversity conservation and sustainable forest management directly involving the local communities. Thirteen communities were explored in the South West Region (SWR) of Cameroon. Samples selection was based on information about recent activities of the communities in the CF process. From this population, a simple random selection and later quantitative and qualitative interviews were carried out with more than 70 different stakeholders through their networking and interest representation in <b>CF.</b> <b>Analysis</b> show that the CF process is centralized, slow, long, complex and expensive, making it difficult for local communities to be an active part in policy implementation. Results also confirm that decentralization and devolution for sustainable local forest governance could offer the communities an opportunity to derive livelihoods from their forests, but the models and processes have also inhibited them through centralized control of the state and its development partners. Furthermore, it shows that CF as a decentralization tool has not really functioned...|$|R

40|$|International audienceReliable {{automatic}} {{procedure for}} locating earthquake in quasi-real time is strongly needed for seismic warning system, earthquake preparedness, and producing shaking maps. The reliability of an automatic location algorithm {{is influenced by}} several factors such as errors in picking seismic phases, network geometry, and velocity model uncertainties. The main purpose of this work is to investigate the performances of different automatic procedures to choose the most suitable one to be applied for the quasi-real-time earthquake locations in northwestern Italy. The reliability of two automatic-picking algorithms (one based on the Characteristic Function (<b>CF)</b> <b>analysis,</b> <b>CF</b> picker, {{and the other one}} based on the Akaike's information criterion (AIC), AIC picker) and two location methods (“Hypoellipse” and “NonLinLoc” codes) is analysed by comparing the automatically determined hypocentral coordinates with reference ones. Reference locations are computed by the “Hypoellipse” code considering manually revised data and tested using quarry blasts. The comparison is made on a dataset composed by 575 seismic events for the period 2000 – 2007 as recorded by the Regional Seismic network of Northwestern Italy. For P phases, similar results, in terms of both amount of detected picks and magnitude of travel time differences with respect to manual picks, are obtained applying the AIC and the CF picker; on the contrary, for S phases, the AIC picker seems to provide a significant greater number of readings than the CF picker. Furthermore, the “NonLinLoc” software (applied to a 3 D velocity model) is proved to be more reliable than the “Hypoellipse” code (applied to layered 1 D velocity models), leading to more reliable automatic locations also when outliers (wrong picks) are present...|$|R
