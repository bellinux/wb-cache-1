Having shipped 330,000 stems in 1880 to 24 million stems in 1930, a quickening decline in the industry meant that by 1969 the transport of bananas by rail ceased. In 1895 Jamaica had exported 97 million fruits; by 1940 the figure had plunged to 40 million, and hit by the loss of the monopoly of the British market and the 1951 hurricane, in 1975 it was just 5 million. Passenger figures had also started to fall, as pre Second World War the government had started a bridge building programme.

40|$|A key {{aspect of}} {{innovation}} {{is the development}} of new products (innovative product development). Successful innovative product development generates increased revenue and profit for the innovating company. In order to capitalise on these benefits companies must develop ideas and opportunities for new products. Successful new products are those which meet the <b>needs</b> of <b>consumers</b> and the identification of <b>consumer</b> <b>needs</b> therefore gives rise to opportunities for innovative product development. However, the research methods traditionally employed in <b>consumer</b> <b>needs</b> investigations are ineffective in identifying the more subtle and deeply rooted requirements of the consumer. This results in a series of hidden <b>consumer</b> <b>needs,</b> the identification of which could highlight previously unrecognised opportunities for innovative product development. Within the literature there exists a lack of clarity surrounding the most effective research methods for identifying hidden <b>consumer</b> <b>needs</b> at the idea generation stage of innovative product development and further research is therefore needed to address this gap in knowledge. The aim of this systematic literature review was to investigate the previous studies of hidden <b>consumer</b> <b>needs</b> in order to generate recommendations for the design of future research initiatives which seek to address this lack of clarity. The literature describing the previous studies of interest was systematically located and reviewed, and conclusions were drawn regarding the most frequently and successfully applied research methods. The concept of a research orientation was subsequently developed, which refers to the underlying process of hidden <b>consumer</b> <b>needs</b> identification. The findings from the review give rise to three high level recommendations for future research into the identification of hidden <b>consumer</b> <b>needs</b> at the idea generation stage of innovative product development, which seek to build on the insights arising from this systematic review in respect of the most frequently and successfully applied research methods and the underlying research orientations...|$|R

Lang instead suggested that the manufacturers and retailers should take more responsibility by making most of these decisions on consumer's behalf before the product even reaches the shelves. This would in turn allow the consumer to avoid endorsing products that are damaging to the environment {{as well as the}} society.|$|E

This key unmet <b>consumer</b> <b>need</b> became a major opportunity. Once Kodak got its product development machine started, it released {{a wide range of}} products which made it easy to share photos via PCs. One of their key innovations was a printer dock, where consumers could insert their cameras into this compact device, press a button, and watch their photos roll out.

Here client and provider both focus and agree on a result instead. There is no determined product involved. [...] Instead the focus is put on the satisfaction of the <b>consumer</b> <b>need</b> - how it is satisfied is not relevant. The product is {{owned and operated by}} the service provider. Profits are therefore correlated to efficiency and providers get a high interest in an optimized and efficient product use to achieve a long service life. In addition to this the offering of a result instead of a pre-specified product makes it possible that sustainable solutions (e.g. low material and energy consumption) can be included from the beginning on.|$|E
50|$|The {{citizens}} of East Germany overwhelmingly rejected the Kaffee-Mix {{and saw the}} coffee shortage as {{an attack on a}} major <b>consumer</b> <b>need</b> that was a large part of everyday life. The coffee mix also damaged some coffee machines, as the mixture contained substitute ingredients such as pea flour, which contains proteins that swell under heat and pressure, clogging the filters. This led to numerous complaints and outraged reactions and protests. Even though the price of coffee on international markets retreated and normalized in 1978, the problems acquiring foreign currency continued into the 1980s in East Germany, causing shortages that damaged the image of the country's political leadership. It is estimated that 20-25% of the entire East German coffee consumption from 1975-1977 arrived from the West in care packages. Coffee attained a value as a symbol of inner-German unity, far above its role as a consumer good or commodity.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on <b>consumer's</b> <b>needs</b> for new products. Normally {{consumers}} search for these new products in internet by using a web search engine. They focus on websites of specific selected enterprises where they suppose {{the existence of such}} new products. Very often, consumers only get information from enterprise websites about existing products. However, these products do not fulfill <b>consumer's</b> <b>needs</b> for new products. Then, they probably request the enterprise hotline to ask for these new products. The manual response process is time and cost consuming. If we identify <b>consumer's</b> <b>needs</b> for new products by time then we easily can preview consumers search queries and their intention. With this information, we can support marketing professionals to optimize the enterprise website concerning consumer's searching for new product ideas. Therefore in this paper, we present a semi-automatically approach that firstly extracts <b>consumer's</b> <b>needs</b> for new products from the internet and that secondly compares these new product ideas with existing or future products from the enterprise. After company's decision to realize the new product ideas as product in future or not, the approach thirdly gives recommendation to marketing professionals for optimizing an enterprise website in a way that consumers find information about their new needs. This increases customer satisfaction and reduces expenditure of time and cost...|$|R
40|$|The current {{research}} examines the psychological motivations of consumers and gives {{new insights into}} the psychology of fashion opinion leaders and opinion seekers. Furthermore, we offer a first validation of the <b>consumer's</b> <b>need</b> for uniqueness scale in Europe with a mixed European sample, using explanatory factorial analysis. We investigate and relate the three concepts of attention to social comparison information, <b>consumer's</b> <b>need</b> for uniqueness and consumer innovativeness in the framework of fashion. Results are based on 106 subjects who participated in an online questionnaire. The main findings demonstrate that (1) attention to social comparison information was positively related to opinion seeking, while <b>consumer's</b> <b>need</b> for uniqueness was negatively related (2) opinion leadership is positively related to <b>consumer's</b> <b>need</b> for uniqueness, yet fully mediated by fashion innovativeness (3) the validation of the counterconformity motivation scale was successful - contributing to crosscultural authentication of the construct. The presentation of empirical work is followed by the study's design and a discussion about the importance and practicability of the recent findings. Finally, limitations as well as implications for future research in psychology and marketing are presented, {{in order to get a}} better understanding of consumer behavior and the role of consumption in people's expression of identity...|$|R

First, we compare the consumer values and <b>consumer</b> <b>needs</b> in these two culture-regions, followed by comparing the different influence of social culture on the hierarchical relationships among <b>consumer</b> values, <b>needs</b> and behaviors by using the structural equation model with multi-group analysis. Our results indicate the important role of social culture in shaping consumer behavior and remind international managers to practice different marketing strategies to satisfy <b>consumer</b> <b>needs</b> in those different culture-regions...|$|R
