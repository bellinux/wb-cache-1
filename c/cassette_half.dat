40|$|To {{learn more}} about how the step of {{cholesterol}} uptake into the brush border membrane (BBM) of enterocytes influences overall cholesterol absorption, we measured cholesterol absorption 4 and 24 h after administration of an intragastric bolus of radioactive cholesterol in mice with scavenger receptor class B, type 1 (SR-BI) and/or cluster determinant 36 (CD 36) deleted. The cholesterol absorption efficiency is unaltered by deletion of either {{one or both of}} the receptors. In vitro determinations of the cholesterol uptake specific activity of the BBM from the mice reveal that the scavenger receptors facilitate cholesterol uptake into the proximal BBM. It follows that cholesterol uptake into the BBM is not normally rate-limiting for the cholesterol absorption process in vivo; a subsequent step, such as NPC 1 L 1 -mediated transfer from the BBM into the interior of the enterocyte, is rate-limiting. The absorption of dietary cholesterol after 4 h in mice lacking SR-BI and/or CD 36 and fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet is delayed to more distal regions of the small intestine. This effect probably arises because ATP binding <b>cassette</b> <b>half</b> transporters G 5 and G 8 -mediated back flux of cholesterol from the BBM to the lumen of the small intestine limits absorption and causes the local cholesterol uptake facilitated by SR-BI and CD 36 to become rate-limiting under this dietary condition...|$|E

5000|$|Strange Times was {{released}} 1 September 1986 on the Geffen label. Initial American pressings {{of the record}} came with a bonus 12" [...] with six additional tracks, {{two of which are}} covers. The American cassette also had the same bonus tracks, split up so that each side of the <b>cassette</b> contained <b>half</b> of the bonus tracks. The record did not have a B side; it was credited as Side A and Side A+.|$|R
50|$|The same design concept {{would later}} {{be used in the}} more {{successful}} Compact Cassette, introduced by Philips in 1962. Similar to the Compact Cassette, the RCA cartridges are reversible so that either side can be played. An auto-reverse mechanism in some models allows the tape to run continuously. Equal to 8-track tape and Stereo-Pak, the tape runs at a standard speed of 3.75 inches per second (IPS). This is double the speed of the Compact <b>Cassette</b> and <b>half</b> of the top speed of consumer reel-to-reel tape recorders, which usually offer both 3.75 IPS and 7.5 IPS speeds. Such consumer reel-to-reel machines are capable of superior audio performance, but only at the faster speed.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Sitosterolaemia {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterised by elevated plasma levels of plant sterols and cholesterol. Sitosterolaemia is caused by gene mutations in either of two ATP-binding <b>cassette</b> (ABC) <b>half</b> transporters, ABCG 5 and ABCG 8. The plasma sterol profile and genetic analysis of a 10 -year-old girl who had tuberous xanthomas {{is the subject of}} this report. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from white blood cells from the proband, her family and a control group of healthy people. All exons of ABCG 5 and ABCG 8 were sequenced. Plasma cholesterol and triglycerides were measured by routine methods. All other plasma sterols were measured by Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry. RESULTS: The proband was found to be homozygous for a single nucleotide mutation in exon 10 of the ABCG 5 gene, consisting of a C to T transition at nucleotide 1336 of the coding sequence, which results in the premature termination of the ABCG 5 protein at amino acid 446 (Arg 446 X). Her mother and brother were also homozygous for the same mutation and all had elevated plasma beta-sitosterol levels. The father was heterozygous and showed normal beta-sitosterol levels. This mutation was not found in healthy normolipidaemic subjects. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel nonsense mutation in exon 10 of the ABCG 5 gene in a 10 -year-old girl showing clinical and biochemical features of sitosterolaemia. This family study broadens the spectrum of the ABCG 5 /ABCG 8 mutations causing sitosterolaemia and helps highlight the correlations between such gene mutations, biochemical phenotype and the development of cardiovascular disease...|$|R
