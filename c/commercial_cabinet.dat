40|$|Engineering and {{microbiological}} tests {{indicated that}} a typical, commercial laminar airflow cabinet was not effective in providing either product protection or agent containment. The cabinet was modified and tested {{through a series of}} alternate configurations to establish a set of design criteria. A mock-up cabinet was developed from these design criteria. The mock-up unit was evaluated for efficiency in providing both product protection and agent containment. In these evaluations, challenge methods were developed to simulate normal, in-use laboratory operations. Controlled bacterial or viral aerosol challenges were used at higher than normal levels to provide stringent test conditions. Test results indicated that the mock-up unit was considerably better in preventing agent penetration (0. 1 to 0. 2 particles per 100 ft 3 of air) than the <b>commercial</b> <b>cabinet</b> (5 to 6 particles per 100 ft 3 of air) during product protection tests. Similarly, agent containment was considerably better in the new cabinet (particle escape of 2 to 3 per 100 ft 3 of air at only one of the five test sites) than in the <b>commercial</b> <b>cabinet</b> (particle escape of 2 to 14 per 100 ft 3 of air at three of the five test sites) ...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays cabinet dryer {{is widely}} use, {{especially}} {{for those who are}} busy working. Besides that, most of the laundries today have a dryer. It is not just because it can run their operation all the time, but they also can prevent the risk to the cloths that might lost or get dirt. Cabinet dryer in the market nowadays is using electrical power as a source in generating heat. The other alternative in manipulation of heat being study to create a new cabinet dryer that make a benefit of waste. From the study, it found that split air conditioning system had waste heat that rejected from it condensing unit. The rejected heat had bad effect to the environment. This project is the study in manipulation of the heat rejected from air conditioning system to dry cloths inside a cabinet dryer. It cover the design of cabinet, investigation of the effectiveness and comparison to the several kind of other dryer. The comparison been made between natural drying and drying by <b>commercial</b> <b>cabinet</b> dryer According to the comparison, it shows that drying by heat rejected from condensing unit is better compares to the natural drying.

50|$|A cabinet is a {{box-shaped}} {{piece of}} furniture with doors or drawers for storing miscellaneous items. Some cabinets stand alone while others are built into a wall or are attached to it like a medicine cabinet. Cabinets are typically made of wood (solid or with veneers or artificial surfaces), coated steel (common for medicine cabinets), or synthetic materials. <b>Commercial</b> grade <b>cabinets,</b> which differ in the materials used, are called casework.|$|R

40|$|Open {{refrigerated}} display cabinets {{are becoming}} more widespread since they are believed to enhance sales by providing {{easy access to the}} chilled products. Air curtains are used as a barrier between the warm ambient air and the chilled compartment of the fridge. The effectiveness of the air curtain depends on many parameters. The objective of this work is to study the effect of jet velocity, turbulence intensity and temperature on the performance of a <b>commercial</b> refrigerated display <b>cabinet</b> aiming at minimizing energy usage. A 2 -D numerical model suing double precision was solved using the computational software “Fluent ” that include the full buoyancy effect and radiation between surfaces. Results include temperature variations, estimation of the entrainment of air into the fridge and heat exchanged with the ambient air in the room. The numerical results indicate that jets with lower velocities at colder temperature enhance the efficiency of the open fridge. A reduction of 19. 5 % in the air entrainment and 23 % in the heat gain was observed in comparison with the current setting.

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteRandall PhebusShiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) are {{frequently}} associated with foodborne illness outbreaks, especially attributable to beef. Intervention methods, {{such as water}} washes and organic acid application, are widely implemented across the beef industry to combat this risk. This research evaluates the efficacy of intervention methods applied to chilled beef subprimal pieces and pre-rigor beef carcasses to reduce STEC contamination. Beef strip loins were inoculated (ca. 5 log CFU/cm²) with a 7 -serotype STEC cocktail and sprayed with increasing concentrations of peracetic acid (200 - 1800 ppm; ambient temperature), lactic acid (3 - 10 %; 55 °C), or a water control before being vacuum-packaged and stored for 24 h at 4 °C. Meat surface excision samples and color readings (L*, a*, and b*) were obtained from each subprimal at three sampling points: post-inoculation, 5 min post chemical spray, and post- 24 h vacuum packaged chilling. Peracetic acid spray and lactic acid spray reduced STEC populations by 0. 5 - 1. 3 log CFU/cm² and 0. 2 – 0. 7 log CFU/cm², respectively, across the incremental concentration increases. All concentrations of peracetic acid and lactic acid concentrations ≥ 3. 5 % reduced (P ≤ 0. 05) STEC populations compared to their respective control. Application of higher concentrations of lactic acid (7 - 10 %) decreased (P ≤ 0. 05) L* and b* values compared to the control, indicating that quality attributes of the subprimals were negatively effected. Carcass intervention methods were evaluated using a three-stage <b>commercial</b> carcass washing <b>cabinet</b> (Chad Equipment). Four pre-rigor carcass sides were inoculated by electrostatically spraying with a 7 -serogroup STEC cocktail (ca. 6. 5 log CFU/ 100 cm²). Three treatments were applied, in order, to each side: ambient water wash, hot water wash (82 - 92 °C at the nozzle head), and antimicrobial mist. Meat surface excision samples {{were taken from the}} bottom, middle, and top section of each carcass side at five sampling points: 30 min post-inoculation, post-ambient water wash, post-hot water wash, post-antimicrobial spray, and after 18 h spray chilling. The combination of the high-volume ambient water wash stage and subsequent hot water wash stage reduced STEC populations on sides by 3. 5, 4. 7, and 4. 8 log CFU/ 100 cm² at the bottom, middle, and top of the carcass, respectively. Due to STEC populations declining to very low or undetectable levels after the hot water stage, minimal additional STEC reductions were observed after chemical spray application and chilling. Sequential antimicrobial treatments applied using a three-stage Chad carcass wash cabinet and a subsequent chill step reduced STEC populations on pre-rigor beef carcasses by 4. 5 – 5. 3 log CFU/ 100 cm²...|$|R
