50|$|Flatbed Digital {{printing}} is {{the reproduction}} of digital images using typically on plastic or paperboard, although {{a wide variety of}} materials can be printed (common, photographic paper, film, cloth, plastic, etc.). Flatbed digital printers use inks made of acrylic monomers that are then exposed to strong UV-light to cure, or polymerize them. This process allows for printing {{on a wide variety of}} surfaces such as wood or metal, <b>carpet,</b> <b>tile,</b> and even glass. The adjustable printing bed makes it possible to print on surfaces ranging in thickness from a sheet of paper often up to as much as several inches. Typically used for commercial applications (retail and event signage), flatbed printing is often a substitute for screen-printing. Since no printing plates or silkscreens must be produced, digital printing technology allows shorter runs of signs to be produced economically.Environmentally, flatbed digital printing is based on a more sustainable system than its commercial predecessor of solvent printing as it produces fewer waste cartridges and less indoor air pollution.The resolution of flatbed printers range from 72 DPI (dots per inch) to about 1700 DPI. One of the advantages of a flatbed printer is its versatility of printable materials although this is limited to only flat materials.|$|E
5000|$|The vast {{majority}} of refined asphalt is used in construction: primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications. According {{to the requirements of}} the end use, asphalt is produced to specification. This is achieved either by refining or blending. It is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately 102 million tonnes per year. Approximately 85% of all the asphalt produced is used as the binder in asphalt concrete for roads. It is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways, car parks and footways. Typically, the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse aggregates such as sand, gravel and crushed rock with asphalt, which acts as the binding agent. Other materials, such as recycled polymers (e.g., rubber tyres), may be added to the asphalt to modify its properties according to the application for which the asphalt is ultimately intended. A further 10% of global asphalt production is used in roofing applications, where its waterproofing qualities are invaluable.The remaining 5% of asphalt is used mainly for sealing and insulating purposes in a variety of building materials, such as pipe coatings, <b>carpet</b> <b>tile</b> backing and paint.Asphalt is applied in the construction and maintenance of many structures, systems, and components, such as the following: ...|$|E

User studies of both simulated and real hardware are reported on. This includes a comparison of tiles of different resolution that suggests that pixel density, over the range of tests, {{is less important than}} visual artifacts introduced by <b>carpet</b> <b>tile</b> edges. Contrary to initial expectations, denser LED spacing did not improve legibility or raise user preferences. Overall our studies suggest that LED-based floor interaction can be legible and effective in a walk-up and use situation...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} improve the {{understanding}} of implementation processes that achieve corporate sustainability by providing explanatory knowledge {{about the role of}} change agents from a sensemaking perspective. The paper also aims to focus on the sustainability efforts of change agents in a multinational <b>carpet</b> <b>tile</b> manufacturer. Design/methodology/approach – The theoretical perspective of the paper is based on the concepts of sensemaking and emergent change. The paper examines sustainability sensemaking in the Dutch subsidiary of the US-based <b>carpet</b> <b>tile</b> manufacturer Interface over a period of ten years (2000 - 2010). Findings – The findings show that embedding sustainability by change agents is typically an emergent change process that consists of small steps and is not predictable. Research limitations/implications – This paper focuses on the emergent, unpredictable aspects of change. More research is needed on processes of adapting the general concept of sustainability to local organisational contexts.

40|$|Elevated {{tropospheric ozone}} {{concentrations}} {{are associated with}} increased morbidity and mortality. Indoor ozone chemistry affects human exposure to ozone and reaction products that also may adversely affect health and comfort. Reactive uptake of ozone has been characterized for many building materials; however, scant information is available on how diurnal variation of ambient ozone influences ozone reaction with indoor surfaces. The primary objective {{of this study is}} to investigate ozone-surface reactions in response to a diurnally varying ozone exposure for three common building materials: ceiling tile, painted drywall, and <b>carpet</b> <b>tile.</b> A secondary objective is to examine the effects of air temperature and humidity. A third goal is to explore how conditioning of materials in an occupied office building might influence subsequent ozone-surface reactions. Experiments were performed at bench-scale with inlet ozone concentrations varied to simulate daytime (ozone elevated) and nighttime (ozone-free in these experiments) periods. To simulate office conditions, experiments were conducted at two temperatures (22 °C and 28 °C) and three relative humidity values (25 %, 50 %, 75 %). Effects of indoor surface exposures were examined by placing material samples in an occupied office and repeating bench-scale characterization after exposure periods of 1 and 2 months. Deposition velocities were observed to be highest during the initial hour of ozone exposure with slow decrease in the subsequent hours of simulated daytime conditions. Daily-average ozone reaction probabilities for fresh materials are in the respective ranges of (1. 7 – 2. 7) × 10 − 5, (2. 8 – 4. 7) × 10 − 5, and (3. 0 – 4. 5) × 10 − 5 for ceiling tile, painted drywall, and <b>carpet</b> <b>tile.</b> The reaction probability decreases by 7 %– 47 % across the three test materials after two 8 -h periods of ozone exposure. Measurements with the samples from an occupied office reveal that deposition velocity can decrease or increase with time. Influence of temperature and humidity on ozone-surface reactivity was not strong...|$|E

40|$|Location-aware {{applications}} play {{an increasingly}} {{critical role in}} everyday life. However, the most common global localization technology - GPS - has limited accuracy and can be unusable in dense urban areas and indoors. We introduce an image-based global localization system that is accurate to a few millimeters and performs reliable localization both indoors and outside. The key idea is to capture and index distinctive local features in ground textures. This {{is based on the}} observation that ground textures including wood, <b>carpet,</b> <b>tile,</b> concrete, and asphalt may look random and homogeneous, but all contain cracks, scratches, or unique arrangements of carpet fibers. These imperfections are persistent, and can serve as local features. Our system incorporates a downward-facing camera to capture the fine texture of the ground, together with an image processing pipeline that locates the captured texture patch in a compact database constructed offline. We demonstrate the capability of our system to robustly, accurately, and quickly locate test images on various types of outdoor and indoor ground surfaces...|$|E
