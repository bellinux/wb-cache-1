They {{are used}} extensively within the aero-engine industry {{but can also}} be found in industria l gas turbines. The manufacture of <b>Curvic</b> couplings involves the precision cutting and grinding of mating teeth on the adjacent ends of the components; the assembly is then clamped together with bolts. The design objectives for aerospace transmissions, and hence the <b>Curvic</b> coupling, are to reduce manufacturing cost, weight and size. The experimental testing of <b>Curvic</b> couplings within an aero-engine environment is time consuming and expensive. The objective {{of this paper is to}} justify con®dence in the results from three-dimensional ®nite element (FE) contact analyses when investigating <b>Curvic</b> couplings. The accuracy of the FE analyses requires a ®ne mesh in the contact region and the capability to deal with stick-slip behaviour in multiple three-dimensional contact surfaces. A comparison of the results from a photoelastic test with the results from an FE analysis provides a validation of the FE contact method for use with <b>Curvic</b> couplings. The results presented in this paper indicate that the photoelastic results agree reasonably well with results of the FE method analyses...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{performance}} {{demands in}} the mechanical manufacturing field have {{lead to a}} great development of the machine tools domain, regarding especially the productivity and the manufacturing precision. When equipping a machine tool with an automatic tool changer and an automatic pallet mechanism, the obtained result is a machining center. For small series products, milling machining centers fulfill the precision and productivity requirements, through the advantages of a reduced auxiliary time and reduced operating errors. This paper presents a new technical solution of the rotary table indexing mechanism used on milling machining centers, which offers a very high positioning precision, by using a <b>curvic</b> coupling and a hydraulically driven table clamp/unclamp mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Image fusion {{is about}} to combine the {{features}} {{of two or more}} partial occluded or damaged images to generate a new effective image. A some image sequence is generated, sometimes some images are not taken well because of lighting problem, instrument problem etc. In such case, by combining the two or more image visible features, a faire image can be constructed. In this present work, ROI analysis based hybrid approach is presented to perform effective generation of reconstructed medical image. After the extraction of image ROI, the next work is to apply the fuzzy over the image to extract the <b>curvic</b> features so that the main boundary areas over the image will get highlighted. This stage will repair the curves for new constructed image. At the final stage, the a statistical measure based statistical measure will be applied to identify the effective image areas and to reconstruct the image features...|$|E
40|$|In {{precision}} assemblies, exact constraint {{techniques have}} been used to align removable components in automobile engines, robotics, and many measurement devices. Exact constraint typically requires controlled precision machining to allow an interface to be repeatable and interchangeable. Elastic averaging techniques can be used instead of exact constraint to create slightly less repeatable interfaces with more generous machining requirements. Averaging techniques work by averaging out errors through controlled compliance between precision surfaces. The key to elastic averaging is to control a large number of features spread over a broad region that elastically deform when separate parts are forced into geometric compliance with each other. Examples include <b>curvic</b> or Hirth couplings [1], waffle trees, and plastic building blocks such as Lego™. Recent research has shown that KOH etched pyramids and grooves in silicon wafers can be used to enable pure mechanical alignment of silicon wafers with sub-micron precision [2]. In this research, elastic averaging techniques are applied to a precision assembly intended to align a line of cylinders containe...|$|E
40|$|This report {{focuses on}} {{providing}} {{a foundation for}} further investigation into the inspection of fixed <b>CURVIC</b> coupling contact pattern by way of modern metrology techniques. Previous bodies of research have utilized coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) to analyze specific features of these couplings, but not the interaction between mating couplings at the areas of contact. It is hoped that this report will {{provide a basis for}} further research to improve the efficiency and reduce the ambiguity inherent in the current contact pattern inspection technique. This report contains a comparison between the results of traditional contact pattern inspection and those obtained by CMM. Test couplings were designed, manufactured, and inspected at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly). Methods used show a correspondence between the calculated distance between regressed surfaces and the amount of transfer seen from tooth to tooth, but are unable to provide the resolution necessary to make any determinations of what that contact may look like across one tooth surface...|$|E
40|$|Fracture {{mechanics}} {{analysis results}} are presented from the following structures/components analyzed at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) between 1982 and 1989 : space shuttle main engine (SSME), Hubble Space Telescope (HST), external tank attach ring, B- 1 stand LOX inner tank, and solid rocket booster (SRB). Results from the SSME high pressure fuel turbopump (HPFTP) second stage blade parametric analysis determine a critical flaw size {{for a wide variety}} of stress intensity values. The engine 0212 failure analysis was a time dependent fracture life assessment. Results indicated that the disk ruptured due to an overspeed condition. Results also indicated that very small flaws in the <b>curvic</b> coupling area could propagate and lead to failure under normal operating conditions. It was strongly recommended that a nondestructive evaluation inspection schedule be implemented. The main ring of the HST, scheduled to launch in 1990, was analyzed by safe-life and fail-safe analyses. First safe-life inspection criteria curves for the ring inner and outer skins and the fore and aft channels were derived. Afterwards the skins and channels were determined to be fail-safe by analysis. A conservative safe-life analysis was done on the 270 redesign external tank attach ring. Results from the analysis were used to determine the nondestructive evaluation technique required...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{performed}} {{in order to}} improve the <b>curvic</b> coupled engagement of a dog clutch situated in the transfer case of a truck. The dog clutch is used to engage the so called all-wheel-drive system of the truck. If the driver tries to engage the all-wheel-drive when truck’s rear wheels already skid, due to a slippery surface a relative rotational speed in the dog clutch will occur. This relative rotational speed will cause the dog clutch to bounce back of itself before engagement, or to not engage at all. The dog clutch has been redesigned to prevent this. Dynamic simulations using MD Adams have been made for the existing model, for the models created in previous works, and for the new model in order to figure out which of them will show the most stable engagement, at high relative rotational speed. The implemented simulations show that better results can be obtained. Separation into two parts of the disc pushed by the fork, shows that dog clutch’s engagement is faster and more stable, comparing to the original model and the other created models. The new model shows better coupling in the whole range of the relative rotational speed from 50 up to 120 rpm...|$|E
40|$|The {{analytical}} {{developments and}} experimental investigations performed {{in assessing the}} effect of internal friction on rotor systems dynamic performance are documented. Analytical component models for axial splines, <b>Curvic</b> splines, and interference fit joints commonly found in modern high speed turbomachinery were developed. Rotor systems operating above a bending critical speed were shown to exhibit unstable subsynchronous vibrations at the first natural frequency. The effect of speed, bearing stiffness, joint stiffness, external damping, torque, and coefficient of friction, was evaluated. Testing included material coefficient of friction evaluations, component joint quantity and form of damping determinations, and rotordynamic stability assessments. Under conditions {{similar to those in}} the SSME turbopumps, material interfaces experienced a coefficient of friction of approx. 0. 2 for lubricated and 0. 8 for unlubricated conditions. The damping observed in the component joints displayed nearly linear behavior with increasing amplitude. Thus, the measured damping, as a function of amplitude, is not represented by either linear or Coulomb friction damper models. Rotordynamic testing of an axial spline joint under 5000 in. -lb of static torque, demonstrated the presence of an extremely severe instability when the rotor was operated above its first flexible natural frequency. The presence of this instability was predicted by nonlinear rotordynamic time-transient analysis using the nonlinear component model developed under this program. Corresponding rotordynamic testing of a shaft with an interference fit joint demonstrated the presence of subsynchronous vibrations at the first natural frequency. While subsynchronous vibrations were observed, they were bounded and significantly lower in amplitude than the synchronous vibrations...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 57 - 68 The {{repair of}} a turbine-compressor-expander {{to improve its}} {{mechanical}} reliability is described. The machine is unique, with two open-faced centrifugal compressor impellers in the center, three steam turbine stages overhanging {{on one end of}} the rotor and a radial hot gas expander overhanging on the other end, all connected with <b>curvic</b> couplings. The machine operates at 18, 500 rpm and is used in the production of 300 tons per day of nitric acid. The plant has two identical units, one serving as a spare unit while the other is in service. The two modules are designated as serial number 1 (SN- 1) and serial number 2 (SN- 2). Ever since their first acquisition in 1978, SN- 1 has proven to be more reliable than SN- 2. While SN- 1 has suffered four failures, SN 2 has suffered 13 failures, six of which have been while the rotor was being field balanced and/or passing through its first bending critical. The other failures can be attributed to various system failures at the plant. Each failure was followed by an overhaul, the extent of which depended upon the amount of damage caused, but no serious consideration was ever given to improving the overall reliability of the machine. By the end of 1992, it was decided that the condition of the machine had deteriorated to the point where it could not be returned to service with a regular overhaul. Additionally, the reliability of the machine had to be improved. A detailed rotordynamic analysis was considered imperative to understanding the nature of the machine. Critical rotor components were manufactured to replace existing ones. A detailed balancing procedure was adopted, and a mock-assembly was performed to set assembly clearances accurately prior to the final assembly. A shop balancing and assembly manual was written to closely control the entire overhaul. The rotordynamic study and procedures adopted to improve the reliability of the machine are described. Also included are the actual startup data. The repair procedures have proven extremely successful, as can be seen from a comparison of the startup data before and after the overhaul. Vibration amplitudes at startup, as the machine passes through its first bending critical speed, are lower than seen previously. The machine was installed in November 1993, and has been shut down and started numerous times. Each time the machine has come up to operating speed without any problems, indicating that the overall mechanical reliability of the machine has been significantly improved. The presented procedures can be easily adapted to improve the mechanical reliability of other machines with similar problems...|$|E
