5|$|Contestants' {{responses}} are revealed {{in order of}} their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. A <b>correct</b> <b>response</b> adds {{the amount of the}} contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it. The contestant with the highest score {{at the end of the}} round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.|$|E
5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It {{is worth noting that}} it is not Hare's intention to divide up the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action for the situation. Such a person would not need a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the <b>correct</b> <b>response</b> to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick and easy to use.|$|E

While some high level officials, particularly from the US and India, continued advocating sustained stimulus until the global recovery is better established, a communiqué from the G20, issued after their June 2010 meeting of finance ministers in Busan, welcomed the trend towards fiscal consolidation rather than further deficit financed stimulus. The G20 did reiterate that forceful government intervention had been the <b>correct</b> <b>response</b> in 2008 and 2009.

25|$|As {{with most}} LucasArts {{adventure}} games, Full Throttle is a single-player video {{game in which}} the player controls {{the actions of the}} player character from a third-person perspective using a computer mouse and point and click interface. By positioning the cursor and clicking the left mouse button, the player causes the player character, Ben, to move around a scene. In certain contexts the cursor will become an arrow (if Ben is on foot) or a directional road sign (if Ben is riding his motorcycle); clicking these causes Ben to travel to another scene. As with other LucasArts graphic adventure games of the era, dialogue plays a large part in the game, presenting story elements and information necessary to advance. During conversations with other characters, several choices of dialogue are presented. The currently selected choice is highlighted, and once clicked, the player character responds with the selected choice. Choosing the <b>correct</b> <b>response</b> allows the player to advance the conversation and ultimately advance the scene.|$|E

500|$|The {{strategy}} for wagering in Final Jeopardy! has been studied. [...] If the leader's score {{is more than}} twice the second place contestant's score, the leader can guarantee victory by making a sufficiently small wager. [...] Otherwise, according to Jeopardy! College Champion Keith Williams, the leader will usually wager such that he or she will have a dollar more than twice the second place contestant's score, guaranteeing a win with a <b>correct</b> <b>response.</b> [...] Writing about Jeopardy! wagering in the 1990s, Gilbert and Hatcher said that [...] "most players wager aggressively".|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, we {{introduced}} a method and equation for inferring {{the allocation of}} attention on a continuous scale. The size of the stimuli, the estimated size of the fovea, and the pattern of results implied that the subjects' responses reflected shifts in covert attention rather than shifts in eye movements. This report describes an experiment that tests this implication. We measured eye movements. The monitor briefly displayed (e. g., 130 ms) two small stimuli (≈ 1. 0 ° × 1. 2 °), situated one atop another. When the stimuli were close together, {{as in the previous}} study, fixations that supported <b>correct</b> <b>responses</b> at one stimulus also supported <b>correct</b> <b>responses</b> at the other stimulus, as measured over the entire session. Yet, on any particular trial, <b>correct</b> <b>responses</b> were limited to just one stimulus. This pattern suggests that the constraints on responding within a trial were due to limits on cognitive processing, whereas the ability to respond correctly to either stimulus on different trials must have entailed shifts in attention (that were not accompanied by eye movements). In contrast, when the stimuli were far apart, fixations that had a high probability of supporting <b>correct</b> <b>responses</b> at one stimulus had a low probability of supporting <b>correct</b> <b>responses</b> at the other stimulus. Thus, conditions could be arranged so that <b>correct</b> <b>responses</b> depended on eye movements, whereas in the “standard” procedure, <b>correct</b> <b>responses</b> were independent of eye movements. The results dissociate covert and overt attention and support the claim that our procedure measures covert attention...|$|R

(Jennings said [...] "What are the '20s?" [...] {{in reference to the}} 1920s. Then Watson said [...] "Whathe 1920s?") Because Watson could not recognize other contestants' responses, it did not know that Jennings had already given the same response. In another instance, Watson was initially given credit for a response of [...] "What is leg?" [...] after Jennings incorrectly responded [...] "What is: he only had one hand?" [...] to a clue about George Eyser (the <b>correct</b> <b>response</b> was, [...] "What is: he's missing a leg?"). Because Watson, unlike a human, could not have been responding to Jennings's mistake, it was decided that this response was incorrect. The broadcast version of the episode was edited to omit Trebek's original acceptance of Watson's response. Watson also demonstrated complex wagering strategies on the Daily Doubles, with one bet at $6,435 and another at $1,246. Gerald Tesauro, one of the IBM researchers who worked on Watson, explained that Watson's wagers were based on its confidence level for the category and a complex regression model called the Game State Evaluator.|$|E

500|$|The Jeopardy! round {{begins when}} the {{returning}} champion selects a clue, {{which may be}} from any position on the game board. The clue is revealed and read aloud by the host, after which any contestant may ring-in using a hand-held signaling device. The first contestant to ring-in successfully is prompted to provide {{a response to the}} clue, phrased {{in the form of a}} question. For example, if a contestant were to select [...] "Presidents for $200", the resulting clue could be [...] "This 'Father of Our Country' didn't really chop down a cherry tree", to which the <b>correct</b> <b>response</b> would be [...] "Who is/was George Washington?" [...] (Contestants are free to phrase the response in the form of any question; the traditional phrasing of [...] "who is/are" [...] for people or [...] "what is/are" [...] for things or words is almost always used.) If the contestant responds correctly, the clue's dollar value is added to the contestant's score, and they may select a new clue from the board. An incorrect response, or a failure to respond within five seconds, deducts the clue's value from the contestant's score and allows the other contestants the opportunity to ring-in and respond.

Rutter and Jennings gave the <b>correct</b> <b>response</b> of Chicago, but Watson's response was [...] "What is Toronto?????"

Dr. Chris Welty, who also worked on Watson, suggested that {{it may not have been}} able to correctly parse the second part of the clue, [...] "its second largest, for a World War II battle" [...] (which was not a standalone clause despite it following a semicolon, and required context to understand that it was referring to a second-largest airport). Eric Nyberg, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a member of the development team, stated that the error occurred because Watson does not possess the comparative knowledge to discard that potential response as not viable. Although not displayed to the audience as with non-Final Jeopardy! questions, Watson's second choice was Chicago.
