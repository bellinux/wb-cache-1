The Act delineates the legislative competence of the Parliament – the areas in which it can make laws – by explicitly specifying powers that are [...] "reserved" [...] to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Scottish Parliament has the power to legislate in all areas that are not explicitly reserved to Westminster. There is a <b>clear</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> responsibility of the powers of both the UK government and the devolved Scottish Government in relation to the formulation and execution of national economic policy as it affects Scotland – this is set out under Section 5 of the Scotland Act 1998.|$|E
2500|$|Stemming {{from his}} work with the Commonwealth Housing Commission in 1945 Bunning {{published}} Homes in the Sun. The book advocated better designed homes, communities, towns and regions to suit the Australian environment. This according to Robin Boyd, established Bunning's as 'the best known architectural publicist in the country'. The dream for postwar planning in Australia for which Bunning's highly advocated was displayed clearly throughout the book, with the most prominent example being a proposed attempt to develop Sydney's first satellite town, which according to Freestone was [...] "refined in later writings". Bunning envisaged a town for 10,000 people, which would provide the best of country and city living in one, with the community areas and industrial areas separated to prevent pollution. There would be a <b>clear</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> transport modes and the communities would also be separated, each serviced by their own facilities. With the town defined by a green belt, an area where any further metropolitan sprawl would be contained. This according to Freestone “synthesised the ideas of Ebenezer Howard and Le Corbusier into a normative formula".|$|E

2500|$|A major {{question}} {{concerning the}} manuscript {{is whether or}} not Blake ever intended to illuminate it. Whether he had devised his method for [...] at the time of composition is unknown, although he did make twelve drawings which were apparently to be included with the poem in some shape or form. Peter Ackroyd suggests that the illustrations, [...] "conceived in the heroic style," [...] were inspired by the work of James Barry and George Romney, both of whom Blake admired and were intended for illustration rather than illumination. Most scholars agree with this theory (i.e. the images wouldn't be combined with the text, they would simply accompany the text) and {{it has been suggested that}} Blake abandoned the project when he discovered the technique to realise his desire for full integration of text and image. His first relief etching was The Approach of Doom (1788), and his first successful combination of words and pictures were All Religions are One and There is No Natural Religion (both 1788), but they were experiments only. His first 'real' illuminated book was The Book of Thel (1789) and it is possible that he abandoned Tiriel to work on Thel after making his breakthrough with All Religions and Natural Religion. According to David Bindman, for example, [...] "Tiriel's <b>clear</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> text and design is transitional in being an example of the conventional method of combining text with design implicitly rejected by Blake in developing the method of illuminated printing. He probably abandoned the series because his new technique took him beyond what had now become for him an obsolete method." ...|$|E

The author interacts with the editor by typing TEX markup as he would do in a normal text editor, with the difference that the outcome of the typed markup is parsed and displayed on-the-fly. We discuss issues regarding both the parsing and presentation phases and we propose implementations for them. In contrast with exist-ing similar tools, the architecture we propose offers better compatibility with TEX syntax, a pervasive use of standard technologies and a <b>clearer</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> content and presentation aspects of the information. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{testable}} restriction on the time-series behavior of consumption and asset returns implied by a representative agent {{model in which}} intertemporal preferences are represented by utility functions that generalize conventional, time-additive, expected utility. The model based on these preferences allows a <b>clearer</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> observable behavior attributable to risk aversion and to intertemporal substitution. Further, it nests the predictions of both the consumption CAPM and the static CAPM, and it allows direct tests of the expected utility hypothesis. We find that {{the performance of the}} non-expected utility model and tests of the expected utility hypothesis are sensitive to the choice of both consumption measure and instrumental variables.

40|$|UML’s current {{definition}} of the role concept comes with many problems, not the least being {{that it is difficult}} to understand and communicate. This paper proposes a revised UML metamodel building on a much simpler role definition. Moreover, it replaces the rather unusual notions of association role and association end role as well as the rarely used association generalization with the more popular concept of overloading, thereby leading to a considerable reduction in the number of modelling concepts. Despite the rather radical nature of the proposed alterations, no changes in UML notation become necessary. However, a notable change in modelling style including in particular a <b>clearer</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> structure and interaction diagrams are among the likely effects of the proposed revision. ...|$|R

50|$|In New Zealand {{there are}} {{typically}} Beginners, Intermediate and Advanced classes, with the <b>clearer</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> moves between the classes.

Intermediate moves introduce single speed double spins and assisted double speed turns, contact with the partners back, and leans (in which one partner takes the others' weight with their body). Advanced moves can include multiple speed, multiple turn spins, loss of contact, significant syncopation, dips and drops (in which one partner takes the weight of the other with their arms) and/or contact with different body parts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Ontologies {{have been}} highly {{successful}} in applications involving annotation and data fusion. However, ontologies {{as the core}} of “Knowledge Driven Architectures ” have not achieved the same influence as “Model Driven Architectures”, {{despite the fact that}} many biomedical applications require features that seem achievable only via ontological technologies – composition of descriptions, automatic classification and inference, and management of combinatorial explosions in many contexts. Our group adopted Knowledge Driven Architectures based on ontologies to address these problems in the early 1990 s. In this paper we discuss first the use cases and requirements and then some of the requirements for more effective use of Knowledge Driven Architectures today: <b>clearer</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> language and formal ontology, integration with contingent knowledge, richer and better distinguished annotations, higher order representations, integration with data models, and improved auxiliary structures to allow easy access and browsing by users...|$|R
40|$|The usual {{notion of}} type coercions that witness subtyping {{relations}} between types is generalized {{to a more}} expressive notion of typing coercions that witness subsumption relations between typings, e. g. pairs composed of a typing environment and a type. This is more expressive and allows for a <b>clearer</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> language constructs with and without computational content. This is illustrated on a second-order calculus of implicit coercions that allows multiple but simultaneous type and coercion abstractions and has recursive coercions and general recursive types. The calculus {{is equipped with a}} very liberal notion of reduction. It models a wide range of type features including type containment, bounded and instance-bounded polymorphism, as well as subtyping constraints as used for ML-style type inference with subtyping. Type soundness is proved by adapting the step-indexed semantics technique to strong reduction strategies, moving indices inside terms so as to control the reduction steps internally...|$|R
