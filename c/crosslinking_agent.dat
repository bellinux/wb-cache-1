[...] For instance, transformation is induced in Streptococcus pneumoniae by the DNA damaging agents mitomycin C (a DNA <b>crosslinking</b> <b>agent)</b> and fluoroquinolone (a topoisomerase inhibitor that causes double-strand breaks). [...] In B. subtilis, transformation is increased by UV light, a DNA damaging agent. In Helicobacter pylori, ciprofloxacin, which interacts with DNA gyrase and introduces double-strand breaks, induces expression of competence genes, thus enhancing {{the frequency of}} transformation Using Legionella pneumophila, Charpentier et al. tested 64 toxic molecules to determine which of these induce competence. [...] Of these only six, all DNA damaging agents, caused strong induction. [...] These DNA damaging agents were mitomycin C (which causes DNA inter-strand crosslinks), norfloxacin, ofloxacin and nalidixic acid (inhibitors of DNA gyrase that cause double-strand breaks), bicyclomycin (causes single- and double-strand breaks), and hydroxyurea (induces DNA base oxidation). [...] UV light also induced competence in L. pneumophila. [...] Charpentier et al. suggested that competence for transformation probably evolved as a DNA damage response.|$|E

40|$|Background. As {{articular}} cartilage {{is unable to}} repair itself, {{there is a tremendous}} clin-ical need for a tissue engineered replacement tissue. Current tissue engineering efforts using the self-assembly process have demonstrated promising results, but the biome-chanical properties remain at roughly 50 % of native tissue. Methodology/Principal Findings. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the feasibility of using exogenous <b>crosslinking</b> <b>agents</b> to enhance the biomechanical properties of a scaffoldless cartilage tis-sue engineering approach. Four <b>crosslinking</b> <b>agents</b> (glutaraldehyde, ribose, genipin, and methylglyoxal) were applied each at a single concentration and single application time. It was determined that ribose application resulted in a significant 69 % increase in Young’s modulus, a significant 47 % increase in ultimate tensile strength, as well as a trend toward a significant increase in aggregate modulus. Additionally, methylglyoxal appli-cation resulted in a significant 58 % increase in Young’s modulus. No treatments altered the biochemical content of the tissue. Conclusions/Significance. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the use of exogenous <b>crosslinking</b> <b>agents</b> on any tissue formed using a scaffoldless tissue engineering approach. In particular, this study demon-strates that a one-time treatment with <b>crosslinking</b> <b>agents</b> can be employed effectively to enhance the biomechanical properties of tissue engineered {{articular cartilage}}.

Crosslinked networks with high biobased content of more than 88 % were obtained after co-photopolymerization between acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) and GACA. The thermal, mechanical and coating properties of these GACA crosslinked AESO networks were investigated and a commonly used <b>crosslink</b> <b>agent</b> triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC) {{was used as the}} control. GACA exhibited more functional groups and better copolymerization with AESO than TAIC, resulting in the higher gel content, crosslink density, tensile strength and modulus as well as much better coating properties (reflected by the higher pencil hardness, better wear resistance and adhesion) of GACA crosslinked AESO networks than TAIC crosslinked AESO networks.

The prepared porous structures were analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermal and mechanical analysis as well as water absorption analysis.

5000|$|Neothramycin A and B are stereoisomeric {{antibiotics}} with anticancer activity. The stereoisomers are interchangeable in {{aqueous solution}} and the antibiotic, Neothramycin, contains both in approximately equal amounts. They belong to the pyrrolo(1,4)benzodiazepine, or anthramycin, group which includes other antibiotics such as anthramycin, tomaymycin, and sibiromycin. Neothramycin was originally isolated from Streptomyces No. MC916-C4, a cycloheximide-producing strain, by Umezawa et al. Subsequent testing has shown its capabilities as an anticancer drug, antiprotozoal drug, and even possible uses in DNA fluorescence based assays. Its activities against cancer warranted phase I testing of the drug.More recently, in 1991, anthramycin derivatives, which {{are very similar to}} neothramycin, have been investigated for their ability to link DNA when dimerized.

Following lysis of cross-linked cells and immunoprecipitation of bacterial RNA polymerase, DNA associated with enriched RNA polymerase was hybridized to probes corresponding to different regions of known genes to determine the in vivo distribution and density of RNA polymerase at these genes. A year later they used the same methodology to study distribution of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II on fruit fly heat shock genes. These reports are considered the pioneering studies in the field of chromatin immunoprecipitation. XChIP was further modified and developed by Alexander Varshavsky and co-workers, who examined distribution of histone H4 on heat shock genes using formaldehyde cross-linking.

50|$|Some hydrogels {{are able}} to respond to stimuli and their {{surrounding}} environments. Examples of these stimuli include light, temperature, pH, and electrical fields. Hydrogels that are temperature sensitive are known as thermogels. Thermo-responsive hydrogels undergo reversible, thermally induced phase transition upon reaching either the upper or lower critical solution temperature. By definition, a crosslinked polymer gel is a macromolecule that cannot dissolve. Due to the polymeric domains created by crosslinking, in the gel microstructure, hydrogels are not homogenous within the solvent system in which they are placed into. Swelling of the network, however, does occur {{in the presence of a}} proper solvent. Voids in the microstructure of the gel where <b>crosslinking</b> <b>agent</b> or monomer has aggregated during polymerization can cause solvent to diffuse into or out of the hydrogel. The microstructure of hydrogel therefore are not constant, and imperfections occur where water from outside of the gel can accumulate these voids. This process is temperature dependant, and solvent behavior depends on whether the solvent-gel system has reached, or surpassed, the critical solution temperature (LCST). The LCST defines a boundary between which a gel or polymer chain will separate solvent into one or two phases. The spinodial and binodial regions of a polymer-solvent phase diagram represent the energetic favorability of the hydrogel becoming miscible in solution or separating into two phases.|$|E

The first coating consisted of 2 mg of glucose oxidase and 20 Âµl of GDP. The second trial involved higher GDP composition which is 100 Âµl.

The <b>crosslink</b> <b>agent</b> insufficiency in the first composition failed to provide good attachment for the enzyme on the electrode.
