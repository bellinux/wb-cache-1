5000|$|US&S first {{patented}} the Model 15A Highway <b>crossing</b> <b>bell</b> on February 20, 1917. The bell {{has been}} {{commonly referred to}} as the [...] "Teardrop" [...] bell by railroaders and signal fans alike because of its unique shape and thus the name has stuck. This bell has appeared on advertising literature for railroad signals {{as far back as the}} 1920s as far abroad as Chile and Italy on early wig wag crossings and flashers. There have been subtle variations in the Teardrop bell over the years ranging from different sized electric coils, inclusion of the patent date on the rain hood, as well as a very early version with a less characteristic rain hood that simply read [...] "UNION, patent pending." [...] This is the most commonly seen variation of the Teardrop. This bell is treasured by many for its slow low pitched ring at an irregular cadence. The production of this bell was discontinued sometime by the 1960s, but WABCO carried replacement castings and service manuals into the 1970s.|$|E
