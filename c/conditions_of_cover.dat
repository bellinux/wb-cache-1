40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to observe the {{influence}} of regional aspects such as climate, management and occupancy of the soybean crops neighborhood, on the temporal evolution of the NDVI/NOAA images. The study was performed during 1999 / 2000, in the northwest region of Rio Grande do Sul - Brazil, and LANDSAT images were used to determine soybeans areas, and images of maximum monthly NDVI/NOAA, to monitor the temporal evolution of the NDVI. The NDVI values, extracted over selected areas in the LANDSAT images, were used to trace the spectral profiles and to identify groups with similar patterns of NDVI evolution (Ward grouping method). The results showed that it is possible to state that the NOAA images are a particularly useful instrument to monitor the surface, and that they express different <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> and use in the neighborhood of soybeans crops.

30|$|Rochester et al. (2010 b) {{reported}} that both chaparral and coastal sage scrub herpetofaunal community diversity and composition changed after the large 2003 southern California wildfires. There were increases in some taxa and decreases in others but, overall, these communities remained simplified {{two years after}} fire. They found that the coastal whiptail (Aspidoscelis tigris Baird & Girard), coast horned lizard (Phrynosoma coronatum Blainville), common side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana Blainville), and orange-throated whiptail (Aspidoscelis hyperythra Cope) populations increased after fire. In contrast, the California toad (Anaxyrus boreas halophilus Camp) decreased, {{as was the case}} for the southern alligator lizard (Elgaria multicarinata Blainville), garden slender salamander (Batrachoseps major Camp), and several snake species (yellow-bellied racer, Coluber constrictor Linnaeus; California kingsnake, Lampropeltis californiae Blainville; gophersnake, Pituophis catenifer Blainville; and striped racer, Masticophis lateralis Hallowell). It was apparently unclear how much of these community differences were due to patterns of survivorship versus ability to adapt to postfire <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover,</b> soil moisture, and food resources. However, the authors suspect that the more open conditions after fire were largely responsible for the decreased herpetofaunal diversity and that, with repeated fires, these sites might be type converted to grass-shrub mosaics with a depauperate fauna. This is consistent with Lillywhite’s (1977) observation of a simplification of the animal community when the shrubland was mechanically and chemically type converted to be more like grassland.|$|E

Methods The sampling was conducted in 19 streams during September and October 2007. All sites were characterized physiographically by application of environmental assessment protocol to Atlantic Forest streams and by some physical and chemical parameters. Of the 19 streams sampled, six were classified as reference, six streams as intermediate (moderate anthropic impact) and seven streams as poor (strong anthropic impact). In each site, a multi-habitat sampling was taken with a kick sampler net. The sample was composed by 20 units, each one corresponded to 1 m 2 of collected substrate, corresponding 20 m 2 of sampling area. The material was placed in a plastic container (500 µm of mesh), washed, homogenized and sub-sampled. For each stream, 6 subsamples were randomly sorted. Results Were collected 2, 113 caddisfly larvae, belonging to 12 families and 28 genera. Hydropsychidae and Leptoceridae were the most abundant families, and Smicridea was the most abundant genus. Sorensen’s index results showed that the streams studied were grouped according to environmental integrity. The Indicator Species Analysis showed only characteristic taxa to reference streams. Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that caddisfly assemblage was strongly influenced by nitrate concentration, pH and <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> riparian vegetation. Multiple regression analysis indicated significant correlations to five genera with some environmental parameters, besides total abundance of Trichoptera. Conclusions Ours results showed that degree of environmental impact, mainly the nitrate concentration, pH, and <b>condition</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> vegetation acted as a major factor in determining the Trichoptera assemblages present in the stream of the Serra da Bocaina, separating streams along an environmental gradient...|$|R
