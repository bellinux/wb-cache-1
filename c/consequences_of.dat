50|$|The {{compactness}} theorem {{says that}} if a formula φ is a logical <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> a (possibly infinite) set of formulas Γ then it is a logical <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> a finite subset of Γ.

5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E
