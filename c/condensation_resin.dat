40|$|Addition cure (X 1 - 2672) and {{condensation}} cure (4 - 3136) silicone resins {{have been}} studied for their mechanical property change with temperature. Properties include maximum flexural stress, flexural modulus and fracture toughness K[sub]IC. Temperature effect on mechanical properties of addition cure resin is substantial and also depends on the crosslinkers used. Generally the maximum stress and flexural modulus decrease with temperature, and the dependence upon crosslinkers in addition cure resin is obvious. Fracture toughness data of addition cure silicone resins have a peaking behavior with the peak appearing [approximately] 58 - 101 CÌ (depending on the crosslinker) below their glass transition temperatures. This {{can be explained by}} the competing effect between network mobility and rigidity of the silicone polymer. Rate effect on fracture toughness of silylphenylene crosslinked 2672 has also been studied. It is concluded that the temperature effect on such a system is more dominant compared to the rate effect. The <b>condensation</b> <b>resins</b> also experience decrease in modulus and strength but the toughness changes little with temperature. This is due to its tight network structure. Silylphenylene crosslinked addition cure resin (2672 B) and the toughened <b>condensation</b> cure <b>resin</b> (3136 T) were used to make silicone fiberglass laminates. They have been successfully processed with a vacuum bagging technique. Silicone resin composites are proved to be thermally stable, moisture resistant and fire resistant. However, they have weak strength and modulus. Their temperature dependence of mechanical properties is also big and results in poor property retention at high temperatures. 2672 B was used to produce hybrid composites with an organic resin-vinyl ester. The processes of curing the hybrid composites in both sequential cure and co-cure methods prove to be successful. The hybrid composites are stronger and their property retention at elevated temperatures is improved compared to silicone resin composites. They also have improved moisture resistance, thermal stability and fire resistance over vinyl ester composites. The co-cured V/B 8 / 4 structure has excellent strength and rigidity and also extraordinary property retention at high temperatures, which {{can be explained by the}} chemical reaction at the silicone resin and vinyl ester resin interface. The hybrid composites prove to be successful in having balanced mechanical and environmental properties. by Yuhong Wu. Thesis (Ph. D.)

25|$|The major uses of phenol, {{consuming}} {{two thirds}} of its production, involve its conversion to precursors for plastics. Condensation with acetone gives bisphenol-A, a key precursor to polycarbonates and epoxide <b>resins.</b> <b>Condensation</b> of phenol, alkylphenols, or diphenols with formaldehyde gives phenolic resins, a famous example of which is Bakelite.

40|$|PMR (Polymerization of Monomeric Reactants) {{technology}} {{was developed in}} the mid- 1970 's at the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field for fabricating high-temperature stable polyimide composites. This technology allowed a solution of polyimide monomers or prepreg (a fiber, such as glass or graphite, impregnated with PMR polyimide monomers) to be thermally cured without the release of volatiles that cause the formation of voids unlike the non-PMR technology used for polyimide <b>condensation</b> type <b>resins.</b> The initial PMR resin introduced as PMR 15 is still commercially available and is used worldwide by aerospace industries as the state-of-the-art resin for high-temperature polyimide composite applications. PMR 15 offers easy composite processing, excellent composite mechanical property retention, a long lifetime at use temperatures of 500 to 550 F, and relatively low cost. Later, second-generation PMR resin versions, such as PMR II 50 and VCAP 75, offer improvements in the upper-use temperature (to 700 F) and in the useful life at temperature without major compromises in processing and property retention but with significant increases in resin cost. Newer versions of nontoxic (non-methylene dianiline) PMR resins, such as BAX PMR 15, offer similar advantages as originally found for PMR 15 but also with significant increases in resin cost. Thus, the current scope of the entire PMR technology available meets a wide range of aeronautical requirements for polymer composite applications...|$|R
40|$|Self-healing microcapsules were {{synthesized}} by in situ polymerization with a melamine {{urea-formaldehyde resin}} shell and an epoxy resin adhesive. The {{effects of the}} key factors, i. e., core–wall ratio, reaction temperature, pH and stirring rate, were investigated by characterizing microcapsule morphology, shell thickness, particle size distribution, mechanical properties and chemical nature. Microcapsule healing mechanisms in cement paste were evaluated based on recovery strength and healing microstructure. The {{results showed that the}} encapsulation ability, the elasticity modulus and hardness of the capsule increased with an increase of the proportion of shell material. Increased polymerization temperatures were beneficial to the higher degree of shell <b>condensation</b> polymerization, higher <b>resin</b> particles deposition on microcapsule surfaces and enhanced mechanical properties. For relatively low pH values, the less porous three-dimensional structure led to the increased elastic modulus of shell and the more stable chemical structure. Optimized microcapsules were produced at a temperature of 60 °C, a core-wall ratio of 1 : 1, at pH 2 ~ 3 and at a stirring rate of 300 ~ 400 r/min.

40|$|Oscillation {{energy has}} been {{proposed}} in a new method to condense resin composites. The principle of this technique assumes that vibration lowers the viscosity of the resin, allowing the material to flow and easily adapt to the cavity walls, {{in a similar way}} as a flowable composite.  The aim {{of the study was to}} assess the efficiency and quality of composite compaction, using one of these new devices. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The study included 20 class I cavities prepared in extracted human molars. The teeth were randomly divided into two groups of 10 cavities.  Both groups were filled with composite material Filtek Z 250 and the adhesive system Single Bond Plus Adhesive Adper TM Adhesive (3 M ESPE).   In the control group, condensation of the composite was done with standard instruments.  In the experimental group, condensation was done using a vibration instrument: Compothixo (Kerr).   The prepared sections were observed on a scanning electron microscope (SEM), VEGA II model LSH (TESCAN). RESULTS: When using Compothixo, the average working time was 8. 53 min / restoration while, when using standard instruments, the average working time was 10. 32 min, which seems to indicate that the vibration technique was more effective than traditional condensation. Microscopic images have shown that neither vibrating condensation nor manual condensation precluded the formation of a hiatus in some areas of the interface between the restoration and the cavity walls, especially in areas of small irregularities. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Condensation</b> of composite <b>resins</b> can be faster when using vibrating instruments. Adaptation of the material to the cavity walls is comparable to that obtained by traditional techniques...|$|R
