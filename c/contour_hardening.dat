40|$|A multi-scale multiphysical {{finite element}} (FE) {{analysis}} {{is presented in}} this paper to predict the microstructural evolution during induction hardening processes. An ad-hoc code has been developed in order to calculate the metallurgical phase changes that occur during heating and cooling steps. This routine has been coupled with a FEM code able to solve the coupled electromagnetic and thermal problem that typically describes the induction heating processes. In induction <b>contour</b> <b>hardening</b> of steels, an external layer of the piece is heated up to the austenitization temperature and then it is cooled down to obtain a layer of martensite. In thermo-metallurgical model, material properties depend on the temperature distribution but also on the microstructure since the material is a mixture of different phases. From the solution of the coupled steady-state, at a given frequency, electromagnetic and transient thermal problem, temperature distribution as well as heating and cooling rates are used for the evaluation of the existing metallurgical phases at every time step. The effect of the latent heat of solid-solid phase transformations has been also considered. The numerical results are compared with experimental one...|$|E
40|$|Two {{groups of}} spur gears {{manufactured}} {{from two different}} materials and heat treatments were endurance tested for surface fatigue life. One group was manufactured from AISI 1552 and was finished ground to a 0. 4 micron (16 micro-in.) rms surface finish and then dual frequency <b>contour</b> induction <b>hardened.</b> The second group was manufactured from CEVM AISI 9310 and was carburized, hardened, and ground to a 0. 4 micron (16 micro-in.) rms surface finish. The gear pitch diameter was 8. 89 cm (3. 5 in.). Test conditions were a maximum Hertz stress of 1. 71 GPa (248 ksi), a bulk gear temperature of approximately 350 K (170 F) and a speed of 10, 000 rpm. The lubricant used for the tests was a synthetic paraffinic oil with an additive package. The test {{results showed that the}} 10 percent surface fatigue (pitting) life of the <b>contour</b> <b>hardened</b> AISI 1552 test gears was 1. 7 times that of the carburized and hardened AISI 9310 test gears. Also there were two early failures of the AISI 1552 gears by bending fatigue...|$|R
40|$|The Laboratory for Electroheat of Padua University, LEP, is {{the only}} Italian {{academic}} group that researches about electroheating. LEP was founded about 40 years ago by prof. Di Pieri, it was leaded for many years by prof. Lupi {{and now it is}} directed by prof. Dughiero. Actually, about 10 people are working in the group. It is also the organizer of the conference ‘HES’, Heating by Electromagnetic Sources, whose 6 th triannual edition will take place this year in May. In the paper, the latest research activities of LEP are presented, mostly with reference to the fields where LEP concentrates its research activity: innovative technologies for the through heating of non ferrous billets, <b>contour</b> induction <b>hardening,</b> silicon melting and crystallization, microwave heating and biomedical application of electromagnetic fields...|$|R
40|$|Induction heating {{has been}} widely used by the heat {{treatment}} industry mainly in the wind-power and automotive sectors, in particular for hardening purposes, in {{a broad range of}} applications, its main advantages being the high repeatability and easy automation of the process, both factors leading to improved manufacturing efficiency and reduced CO 2 emissions. Though, traditional furnace-based case hardening treatments still represent the choice of reference when performance requirements are particularly demanding, either for the critical operating conditions or safety-related issues. The processes of CIH (<b>Contour</b> Induction <b>Hardening),</b> compared to the traditional carburizing processes, allows to reduce the deformations after heat treatment. The main purpose of these treatments, as well as increases the surface hardness of the piece, is to induce compressive stresses in the superficial layer, improving the fatigue behavior. A multiphysics magneto-thermal simulation can be developed in order to calculate the temperature distribution in the gear, setting the input parameters such as currents, frequencies and treatment time...|$|R
