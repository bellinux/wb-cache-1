40|$|SUMMARY-Cells {{derived from}} {{adenovirus}}-induced hamster tumors grew as colonies in soft agar; normal hamster cells did not. Tumor cells induced by "hybrid " virus, i. e., adenovirus type 7 with simian virus 40, (SV 40) and by type 12 /SY 40 "hybrid " virus formed larger colonies than did tumor cells induced by adenoviruses types 12 or 31 without the SY 40 gene(s). When transplanted into hamsters, <b>colonies</b> <b>of</b> types 7 /SY 40 and 12 /SV 40 cells induced progressively growing tumors. The smaller <b>colonies</b> <b>of</b> types 12 and 31 cells tested in these experiments {{did not cause}} tumors in ham-sters, however, and this {{might be due to}} the small number of cells in these colonies. The cytologic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>colonies</b> <b>of</b> type 7 /SV 40 cells and the hamster tumors they induced were similar to those of SY 40 -induced tumors; <b>colonies</b> <b>of</b> type 12 /SY 40 cells and the hamster tumors they caused resembled adenovirus type 12 -induced tumors.

40|$|Few data exist {{regarding}} {{the effects of}} long-term housing of rats and mice in the same secondary enclosure. Historical reproductive and growth data were compared for <b>colonies</b> <b>of</b> mice and rats maintained in open-topped cages in either single-species or dual-species barrier rooms. This analysis included reproductive parameters (litter size at birth, litter size at weaning, and pups missing at weaning) collected from 33 <b>colonies</b> <b>of</b> mice comprising 500 to 38, 500 breeding females and 28 <b>colonies</b> <b>of</b> rats totaling 350 to 4, 600 breeding females, and representative samples from 28 <b>colonies</b> <b>of</b> each species were analyzed for weight gain from weaning to adulthood. The {{presence or absence of}} the other species was not associated with statistically significant differences in weight gain or any of the reproductive parameters.
