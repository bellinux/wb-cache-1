40|$|A concise {{method was}} {{developed}} for quantifying native disulfide-bond formation in proteins using isotopically labeled internal standards, which were easily prepared with proteolytic 18 O-labeling. As the method has much higher throughput to estimate the amounts of fragments possessing native disulfide arrangements by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) than the conventional high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses, it allows many different experimental <b>conditions</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed</b> in a short time. The method was applied to refolding experiments of a recombinant neuregulin 1 -β 1 EGF-like motif (NRG 1 -β 1), and the optimum conditions for preparing native NRG 1 -β 1 were obtained by quantitative comparisons. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) was most effective at the reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio of 2 : 1 for refolding the denatured sample NRG 1 -β 1 with the native disulfide bonds...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Current value {{modeling}} ontologies {{are grounded}} {{on the economic}} premise that profit sharing <b>is</b> a critical <b>condition</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed</b> during the configuration of a value constellation. Such a <b>condition</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reinforced through a monitoring mechanism design, since a value model expresses only promises (but not assurances) of value creation. Hence there <b>is</b> a need <b>to</b> extend current value modeling ontologies with a monitoring ontology. This ontology will enable business practitioners to design value models that are enriched with internal monitoring organization. It will also allow these stakeholders to develop a library of monitoring value models, which could <b>be</b> explored <b>to</b> discover and select the most cost-efficient monitoring policies according to their needs. Aligned with this vision, the main contribution of this work is the so-called Value Monitoring Ontology (VMO), which formalizes a Service monitoring logic for value constellations. The logic combines fundamental principles of Agency Theory, Language Action Perspective (LAP) and Service-Dominant Logic. The ultimate modeling rationale behind VMO <b>is</b> <b>to</b> leverage Service monitoring as a question of Business Strategy, through the injection of a Service monitoring logic in value models, {{as part of the}} initial configuration of value constellations. The applicability of VMO is demonstrated here through real-world business cases in Customs Control, Intellectual Property Rights in the Digital Music Industry, and Renewable Energy. The feasibility analysis reported in this document supports the claim that VMO is a valid ontological proposition, which <b>is</b> addressed especially <b>to</b> research communities in Business Service Design, Service-Oriented Computing, Value Modeling and Ontology Engineering. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved prediction method for the heat transfer and {{pressure drop in}} the shell side of a horizontal shell and tube evaporator. The results from an experimental test program are used in which {{a wide range of}} evaporating two-phase shell side flow data was collected from a TEMA E-shell evaporator. The data are compared with shell side heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop models for homogeneous and stratified flow. The comparison suggests a deterioration in the heat transfer data at low mass fluxes consistent with a transition from homogeneous to stratified flow. The pressure drop data suggest a stratified flow across the full test range. A new model is presented that suggests the transition in the heat transfer data {{may be due to the}} extent of tube wetting in the upper tube bundle. The new model, which also takes into account the orientation of the shell side baffles, provides a vast improvement on the predictions of a homogenous type model. The new model would enable designers of shell side evaporators/reboilers to avoid operating conditions where poor heat transfer could be expected, and it would also enable changes in process <b>conditions</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed</b> for their implications on likely heat transfer performance.

The COMMONCENSE project has prepared and provided information about the energy implications of the Standard and in particular whether the Standard is encouraging high-energy buildings {{in the case of}} new buildings and major rehabilitations. Qualitative and quantitative information about the energy implications of the Standard are given, using a range of different cooling and heating techniques and building forms. More specifically, the required energy consumption of twenty eight buildings of different types (offices, hospitals, schools, residences) in Europe was calculated, assuming that the buildings belong to each of the three thermal comfort categories I, II, III as described in the Standard. From these calculations, it was determined if the thermal comfort categories of the Standard express real satisfaction with the environment and, at the same time, if low energy buildings could easily comply with the Standard. The calculated energy consumption for each type of building was compared against the existing national benchmarks. In general, by changing the thermal comfort category from I to II or to III as defined in EN 15251, a passage of the building from a higher to a lower energy category is noticed, according to each the existing national benchmarks and legislation.

40|$|Background: Swedish youth clinics {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} comprehensive and consolidated examples of a nationwide network of health care services for young people. However, studies evaluating their 'youth-friendliness' and the combination of factors that makes them more or less 'youth-friendly' have not been conducted. This protocol will scrutinise the current youth-friendliness of youth clinics in northern Sweden and identify the best combination of conditions needed in order to implement the criteria of youth-friendliness within Swedish youth clinics and elsewhere. Methods/design: In this study, we will use qualitative comparative analysis to analyse the conditions that are sufficient and/or necessary to implement Youth Friendly Health Services in 20 selected youth-clinics (cases). In order to conduct Qualitative Comparative Analysis, we will first identify the outcomes and the <b>conditions</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed.</b> The overall outcome - youth-friendliness - will be assessed together with specific outcomes for each of the five domains - accessible, acceptable, equitable, appropriate and effective. This will be done using a questionnaire to be applied to a sample of young people coming to the youth clinics. In terms of conditions, we will first identify what might be the key conditions, to ensure the youth friendliness of health care services, through literature review, interviews with professionals working at youth clinics, and with young people. The combination of conditions and outcomes will form the hypothesis to be further tested later on in the qualitative comparative analysis of the 20 cases. Once information on outcomes and conditions is gathered from each of the 20 clinics, it will be analysed using Qualitative Comparative Analysis. Discussion: The added value of this study in relation to the findings is twofold: on the one hand it will allow a thorough assessment of the youth-friendliness of northern Swedish youth clinics. On the other hand, it will extract lessons from {{one of the}} most consolidated examples of differentiated services for young people.

40|$|The European Union has {{implemented}} some of {{the most}} progressive conservation Directives in the world. These Directives are implemented in different ways, have different reporting cycles and use unique terminologies. The objectives of all the Directives require that the ecosystem based approach be applied when assessing the âstatusâ of the benthic environment. Benthic ecologists are faced with particular challenges when addressing the requirements of these Directives. Some anthropogenic activities in designated waterbodies can be difficult to monitor due to the variable nature of the environment in which they occur. Some of the newest forms of anthropogenic activities in the coastal environment may have significant impacts on local hydrographic regimes. This will require the relationship between the benthos and modified hydrodynamic <b>conditions</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed.</b> Large scale predictive models will be required to form baseline datasets for benthic communities within Irelandâs Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Large scale mapping initiatives such as these are financially costly and it is important for benthic ecologists to understand the effectiveness of the available tools and resources prior to carrying out such studies. This thesis presents some new methods of benthic habitat assessment which can help to circumvent {{some of the}} key issues facing benthic ecologists working in response to EU Directives. We assess the effects of intertidal bivalve trestle cultivation on important bird feeding grounds in Natura 2000 sites. We present the Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) Infaunal Quality Index (IQI) as an effective tool for assessing the risk posed to the conservation status of these sites. The potential effects of tidal energy extraction on epibenthic reef communities in a Natura 2000 site are assessed. Case studies are presented that assess the spatial and temporal effects of tidal turbine installation and operation. The relationship between epibenthic communities and a range of current velocities required to produce rated tidal energy are assessed. The turbulent wake of a tidal energy turbine was simulated and the relationship between epibenthic community structure and the simulated modified wake is assessed. We present the High Energy Hard Substrate (HEHS) index, a new EQR that was developed for use in animal-dominated, stable reefs, as an effective monitoring tool within tidal energy extraction sites. The effectiveness of hydrodynamic modelling and acoustically classified sediment data, as predictors of benthic biotopes was assessed using Galway Bay as a case study.

In constructing such a comprehensive field model, the SH domain approach would be an effective alternative to the modelling approaches directly allowing for the surface integral conditions in the spatial domain (Gubbins, 1984; Bloxham and Gubbins, 1986; Constable et al., 1993; O’Brien et al., 1997; Jackson et al., 2007).|$|R
40|$|From a geoscience perspective, {{coastal lagoons}} are {{essentially}} ephemeral features which {{are part of}} a continuum of coastal environments. Their natural hydromorphological evolution is seldom if ever permitted to take place as a consequence of human action; either directly by engineering interventions, to maintain or create navigable inlets, or indirectly due to activities within their catchment areas. The hydromorphological impacts of historical, contemporary and proposed engineering activities in coastal lagoons around in the world are reviewed and from these a powerful exemplar is that of the Aveiro system in Portugal. Here, two centuries of channelization, jetty and breakwater construction and progressive dredging have transformed a then fluvially dominant system into one that is today tidally dominant. Both the tidal range and tidal prism have increased along with the extent of saline intrusion. The associated stresses imposed by increased tidal currents have, in turn, led to important changes in the sedimentary regime and to the loss of almost all seagrass species which were once abundant in the system. This, along with observations from other related case studies, raises important questions regarding the concept of lagoon ecosystem ‘health’ and the baseline or reference <b>conditions</b> <b>to</b> which it <b>is</b> <b>assessed...</b>|$|R
40|$|Many {{instances}} of large-scale coordination occur in real-life social situations without the explicit {{awareness of the}} individuals involved. While the majority of research to date has examined dyadic interactions – those between two individuals – during intentional or deliberate coordination, the present review surveys the handful of recent studies investigating behavioral and physiological synchrony across groups {{of more than two}} people when coordination was not an explicit goal. Both minimal (e. g., visual information, shared location) and naturalistic (e. g., choir singing part, family relationship) group interactions appear to promote unintentional group synchrony although they have so far only been studied separately. State differences in unintentional group synchrony, or the relative presence of coordination in various <b>conditions,</b> have tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed</b> differently, such as using correlation-type relationships, compared to its temporal dynamics, or changes over time in the degree of coordination, which appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> best captured using phase differences. Simultaneously evaluating behavioral, physiological, and social responses as well systematically comparing different synchrony measures could further our understanding of the influences on and measures of group synchrony, allowing us to move away from studying individual persons responding to static laboratory stimuli and towards investigating collective experiences in natural, dynamic social interactions...|$|R

Underlying this main purpose <b>was</b> intended <b>to</b> study {{the behavior of the}} product developed in four different storage <b>conditions.</b> <b>To</b> this end, <b>were</b> <b>assessed</b> of color, moisture, water activity (aw), antioxidant activity and sensory analysis along the storage conditions. Finally, it <b>was</b> intended <b>to</b> compare the products developed with microalgae. Regarding the color parameter, it was found that there is na increase in green staining accompanying the increasing concentrations of microalgae. However, this increase in color between the products with different concentrations of microalgae, only becomes noticeable sensorially with additions of microalgae equal or higher than 0. 10 %. The moisture and aw <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> have a very similar behavior between the control product and those containing microalgae. The products with microalgae follow the hygroscopic profile of control products and exhibit good stability, as does the aw. Products with higher antioxidant activity were, in general, those containing 0. 10 % of microalgae. Sensory analysis revealed that products with better ratings were those containing essence of melo...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: One of {{the most}} popular methods for {{evaluating}} old people’s health <b>condition</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> their functional practice. The aim of this study <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> the status of daily living activities among the older people of Maku, Iran. Methods: The present cross-sectional study was accomplished among 216 older people in Maku via simple random sampling. Participant’s subjective and demographic information were gathered and their daily living activities status was measured by the KATZ index. Results: The participants' mean age was 70. 09 ± 7. 98. Most of the elderlies were men (59. 3 %) and illiterate (38. 4 %). Of them, 10. 6 % were dependent, 6 % needed help or were partially dependent, and 82. 9 % were independent in their daily living activities. Significant associations were observed between daily living activities and age, education level, marital status and living condition (p< 0. 001). Married old adults were more dependent than other ones living alone (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Although most of the participants were independent, they needed assistance for few of their daily living activities. Also, since age was significantly correlated with daily living activities, it <b>is</b> necessary <b>to</b> implement educational health living programsfor older people suffering from functional restrictions. Also, providing suitable facilities, convenience and human resources should  be taken into consideration...|$|R
40|$|In {{countries}} like India pedestrians form {{a large percentage}} of traffic volume and they are the most vulnerable road users. Movement of pedestrian <b>are</b> not restricted <b>to</b> the lanes but pedestrians experience certain physical boundaries such as walkways or pedestrian ways which restrict their movement. Normally Indian roads experience inefficient facilities for pedestrians, which leads to a number of fatal accidents all over the country almost every day. To know the efficiency of roadways in aspect to accommodate the pedestrian travel or how effectively they are useful for pedestrians, walking <b>conditions</b> need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed.</b> This assessment helps further for the development of road geometry, road-side furniture and road network assets etc. Estimation of Pedestrian Level of Service (PLOS) is the most common approach to assess the quality of operations of pedestrian facilities. The main purpose of this study <b>is</b> <b>to</b> outline suitable methodology to evaluate Pedestrian Level of Service for both on street and off-street aspect in Indian condition. All the existing models have certain limitations for which they are not applicable for Indian <b>conditions.</b> In order <b>to</b> assess the PLOS for India it <b>is</b> highly necessary <b>to</b> develop a new model. All the parameters affecting PLOS are considered and accordingly data was collected. Videography <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most efficient method for the collection of traffic data. Video of traffic flow was taken during the peak hours of the day in 15 minutes segments at various locations in Bhubaneswar and Rourkela city. Video data were extracted in order to find the value of different parameters. The extracted data <b>were</b> used <b>to</b> develop a model and regression analysis was used as the main tool for the model development. Proposed model is quite significant as it gives the PLOS value as it is observed on the segment. It describes the traffic scenario very neatly and considers the effect of all parameters those affect pedestrian movement. Proposed model was also compared with the existing models and it was observed that the proposed model gives better result than the existing models. PLOS estimated using the proposed model shows that ivalmost 70 % of road segment gives level of service ‘C’ and ‘D’. 15 % to 20 % road segment comes under level of service ‘E’ and ‘F’. Only a few road segments come under level of service ‘A’ or ‘B’...|$|R
40|$|A lidar {{simulator}} has <b>been</b> applied <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> {{the performances}} of a satellite water vapour differential absorption lidar (DIAL) system. Measurements performed by the airborne Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) water vapour DIAL on 15 May 2002 during ESA’s Water Vapour Lidar Experiment (WALEX), in combination with MM 5 mesoscale model output, <b>were</b> used <b>to</b> obtain backscatter and water vapour fields with high resolution and accuracy. These data and model output serve as input for the simulator, allowing {{for the performance of}} satellite DIAL under highly-inhomogeneous atmospheric <b>conditions</b> including clouds <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed.</b> The airborne measurements show an intrusion of stratospheric air into the troposphere, and MM 5 data used above the DLR Falcon airplane flight altitude are characterized by very high upper tropospheric humidity levels, comparable to those associated with strong mid-latitude transport events from the troposphere to the lowermost stratosphere. Results of the simulator reveal that the maximum systematic error does not exceed 5 % up to 16 km, except in the presence of thick cirrus and mid level clouds with an optical thickness up to 2 and, occasionally, inside the dry stratospheric intrusion, while the random error is less than 20 % up to 16 km when spatial measurement resolutions are applied that follow the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) threshold observational requirements for numerical weather prediction (NWP). The bias is even smaller if a drier upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) region from a reference atmosphere is considered. The results confirm the capability of satellite water vapour DIAL systems to retrieve thin structures of the tropospheric water vapour and particle backscatter fields, as well as its capability to provide low bias measurements with high precision even in the presence of clouds...|$|R
