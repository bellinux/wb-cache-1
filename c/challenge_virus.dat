40|$|Infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) causes {{respiratory}} distress, decreased egg production, conjunctivitis, {{and death}} in chickens. ILT can be prevented by vaccination. Traditionally, that vaccination is with a chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccine. However, CEO vaccines can revert to virulent ILTV and cause outbreaks. One of the successes of the recombinant vaccines with gene inserts for ILT {{is that they do}} not revert to virulence, but do prevent ILT symptoms. However, these same recombinant vaccines do not necessarily prevent replication of ILTV in the trachea of chickens, which then can lead to ILT outbreaks. One of the regulations for ILT vaccines is that they must protect chickens against inoculation with an ILT <b>challenge</b> <b>virus.</b> All licensed vaccines in the U. S. are licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB). The CVB provides ILT <b>challenge</b> <b>virus</b> to biologics companies for efficacy testing of vaccines. The current USDA <b>challenge</b> <b>virus</b> strain was generated through egg passage from a 1960 s strain of ILTV. Recently, the CVB was able to acquire an ILT field isolate from an outbreak in a laying hen flock that had been vaccinated with a recombinant ILT vaccine. Mortality, clinical signs and pathogenicity of this field isolate were compared to the current USDA <b>challenge</b> <b>virus.</b> An interesting aspect of the research was that several asymptomatic chickens still had tracheal lesions, both from the field isolate and current <b>challenge</b> <b>virus,</b> indicating viral replication without clinical signs. This is not entirely surprising due to research indicating similar results with some recombinant ILT vaccines, but it does reinforce that prevention of symptoms does not equal prevention of viral replication. The ILT field isolate produced clinical signs and tracheal lesions similar to the USDA <b>challenge</b> <b>virus,</b> and the field isolate was able to cause symptoms at a lower infectious douse then the USDA <b>challenge</b> <b>virus</b> to achieve the same results.

The animals also developed vaccine virus-specific CTLs that recognized homologous as well as heterologous pathogenic SHIVs and SIV, and also soluble inhibitory factors that blocked the in vitro replication of the vaccine strains and different <b>challenge</b> <b>viruses.</b> Virus-specific cellular and humoral responses were sustained throughout a 58 -week prechallenge period. To model aspects of natural transmission, the animals received a mucosal (rectal) challenge, with a mixture of three <b>challenge</b> <b>viruses,</b> SHIVKU, SHIV 89. 6 P, and SIVmacR 71 / 17 E. Two mock-vaccinated control animals inoculated with the same mixture of <b>challenge</b> <b>viruses</b> developed large numbers of infectious PBMC, high plasma viremia, and precipitous loss of CD 4 + T cells.

40|$|The {{development}} of a classical swine fever (CSF) subunit marker vaccine, based on viral envelope glycoprotein E 2, and a companion diagnostic test, based on a second viral envelope glycoprotein E(RNS), will be described. Important properties of the vaccine, such as onset and duration of immunity, and prevention of horizontal and vertical transmission of virus were evaluated. A single dose of the vaccine protected pigs against clinical signs of CSF, following intranasal challenge with 100 LD 50 of virulent classical swine fever virus (CSFV) at 2 weeks after vaccination. However, <b>challenge</b> <b>virus</b> transmission to unvaccinated sentinels was not always completely inhibited at this time point. From 3 weeks up to 6 months after vaccination, pigs were protected against clinical signs of CSF, and no longer transmitted <b>challenge</b> <b>virus</b> to unvaccinated sentinels. In contrast, unvaccinated control pigs died within 2 weeks after challenge. We also evaluated transmission of <b>challenge</b> <b>virus</b> in a setup enabling determination of the reproduction ratio (R value) of the virus. In such an experiment, transmission of <b>challenge</b> <b>virus</b> is determined in a fully vaccinated population at different time points after vaccination. Pigs challenged at 1 week after immunization died of CSF, whereas the vaccinated sentinels became infected, seroconverted for E(RNS) antibodies, but survived. At 2 weeks after vaccination, the challenged pigs seroconverted for E(RNS) antibodies, {{but none of the}} vaccinated sentinels did. Thus, at 1 week after vaccination, R> 1, and at 2 weeks, R= 0, implying no control or control of an outbreak, respectively. Vertical transmission of CSFV to the immune-incompetent fetus may lead to the birth of highly viraemic, persistently infected piglets which are one of the major sources of virus spread. Protection against transplacental transmission of CSFV in vaccinated sows was, therefore, tested in once and twice vaccinated sows. Only one out of nine once-vaccinated sows transmitted <b>challenge</b> <b>virus</b> to the fetus, whereas none of the nine twice-vaccinated sows did. Finally, our data show that the E(RNS) test detects CSFV-specific antibodies in vaccinated or unvaccinated pigs as early as 14 days after infection with a virulent CSF strain. This indicates that the E 2 vaccine and companion test fully comply with the marker vaccine concept. This concept implies the possibility of detecting infected animals within a vaccinated population.

We have examined the effects of eliciting mucosal as well as systemic immune responses on protection against genital challenge infection with virulent HSV- 2 in mice immunized with a replication-defective mutant of HSV- 2. In addition, we have examined the types of immune responses elicited by immunization by the different routes under conditions known to provide protection. We observed that immunizations at parenteral and distal mucosal sites generate immune responses that have an additive effect in protection against challenge infection with virulent HSV- 2. Immunization at either of these sites alone prevented paralysis and death after <b>challenge</b> <b>virus</b> infection and reduced replication of the <b>challenge</b> <b>virus</b> in the genital mucosa, although subcutaneous immunization was more effective in reducing virus replication. Simultaneous immunization at the two sites led to the greatest reduction in mucosal replication of <b>challenge</b> <b>virus.</b> The type of response generated was also affected by the route of immunization. Subcutaneous immunization results in a strong systemic immune response that is somewhat biased toward a Th 1 T cell response, while intranasal immunization induces mucosal as well as systemic immunity, as evidenced by HSV-specific IgA in vaginal secretions, and a stronger bias toward a Th 1 response.

Moreover, some of the CD 4 T cell clones that were expanded during primary SIV infection re-emerged after challenge suggesting their role in protection against the <b>challenging</b> <b>virus.</b> These results underline the importance of maintaining the CD 4 T cell repertoire developed during acute infection and point to the restriction of the CD 4 response to the vaccine as a correlate of protection...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Quail, chickens, and turkeys vaccinated with pigeon and {{fowl pox}} viruses were not {{protected}} against challenge of their immunity with quail pox virus and they developed severe cutaneous lesions of pox. When quail and chickens were vaccinated with quail pox virus and given pigeon and fowl pox <b>challenge</b> <b>viruses,</b> no protection was present. Thus, quail pox virus had no immunologic relationship to pigeon and fowl pox viruses. Psittacine pox virus applied as a vaccine in quail and chickens {{also failed to}} protect against quail pox <b>virus</b> <b>challenge.</b> However, quail, chickens, and turkeys vaccinated with quail pox virus were protected against quail pox <b>virus</b> <b>challenge.</b> An isolate of psittacine pox virus, applied as a vaccine, protected chickens against challenge with the same virus isolate and also against challenge with two other psittacine pox virus isolates, confirming a close or identical antigenic relationship with each other. When combined in a multivalent vaccine, quail, psittacine, and fowl pox viruses induced excellent protection in chickens against challenge with the three respective viruses. The {{presence or absence of}} "takes " or reactions following vaccination by the wing web route did not necessarily correlate with {{the presence or absence of}} immunity noted from challenge by feather follicle virus application. The role of quail and psittacine pox viruses as potential pathogens for poultry was discussed briefly. (Key words: pox virus, pathogenicity, vaccines, immunity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMeasles {{infection}} {{and the host}} immune response to measles virus were compared using naive and immunized rhesus monkeys. The monkeys were experimentally challenged with a wild-type strain of measles virus inoculated intranasally. After pathogenic <b>virus</b> <b>challenge,</b> measles <b>virus</b> was detected in mononuclear cells of peripheral blood, lymph node, and spleen in naive monkeys and viremia peaked on Day 7. However, only one of five vaccinated monkeys had a low virus titer in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} at one time point after <b>challenge.</b> No <b>virus</b> was detected in the lymphoid tissues from an immunized monkey that was euthanized on Day 7 of infection. Measles-specific IgM, IgG, neutralizing antibody, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes were detected in vaccinated monkeys before challenge, but antibody titers were significantly lower in immunized monkeys than in naive monkeys after challenge. Measles-specific IgG antibody and cytotoxic T cell responses were still detected more than 1 year after vaccination or infection. This animal model is useful for the further study of measles pathogenesis, immunosuppression, and immunologic memory...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Foot-and -mouth {{disease to}} pigs is serious {{recently}} around the world. "Vaccination prevention" {{is still an}} important policy. OIE specifies 10, 000 TCID 50 (0. 2 ml) of virulent <b>virus</b> for <b>challenge</b> test in pigs to test the potency of FMD vaccine by intradermal route inoculating the virus in the heel bulbs of one foot or by intramuscular route administering into one site of the neck behind the ear. Convenience and speediness {{are available in the}} process of potency test of commercial FMD vaccine. We selected the route of "administering into one site of the muscular part of the neck behind the ear" because of convenience and speediness. However, it was difficult to infect control pigs even up to 100, 000 TCID 50, so we changed the <b>challenged</b> <b>virus</b> from cell-passaged strain to suckling mice-passaged one, measured its PID 50 (pigs median infected dose) and defined the <b>virus</b> <b>challenge</b> dose as 1000 PID 50. Meanwhile, we arranged the number of control pigs from two to three for easy evaluation. </p...|$|R

30|$|To {{the best}} of the authors’ knowledge, there has been little work on plant disease models with cross {{protection}} (see [10, 20, 21]). Gao et al. [20] took seasonality into account and put forward a nonautonomous plant disease model with cross protection. The results showed that cross protection {{played an important role in}} controlling the spread of the <b>challenging</b> <b>virus</b> in plants. Zhang et al. [21] proposed a model to study cross protection between the viruses in 1999. Zhang and Holt [10] improved the model in [21], in which cross protection can occur both naturally and through artificial intervention. Our main purpose is to investigate the transmission of HLB between citrus tree and psyllid populations with cross protection and evaluate the effect of cross protection in controlling the spread of HLB.|$|R
