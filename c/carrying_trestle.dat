50|$|For the {{purposes}} of discharging material below, a coal <b>trestle</b> <b>carried</b> a dead-end track, rather than a bridge.|$|R
50|$|Two notable {{landmarks}} {{along the}} creek's course are high trestles: a trolley trestle about 30 ft high runs across the creek in Smedley Park, in Nether Providence Township; this <b>trestle</b> <b>carries</b> the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority's 101 trolley line from Media, Pennsylvania across the creek. About a mile (1 mi) south, a 1000 ft, 100 ft <b>trestle</b> <b>carries</b> SEPTA's Media/Elwyn Line commuter railroad line across the creek, which by now winds through a deep valley. The trestle is half in Nether Providence Township (west of the creek) and half in Swarthmore borough (east of the creek).|$|R
5000|$|The slate slabs for {{billiard tables}} were <b>carried</b> on special <b>trestle</b> wagons {{similar to those}} on the nearby Corris Railway. Quarry workers rode in open cars which were {{occasionally}} also used for tourist excursions. During the First World War a branch was laid in lightweight portable [...] "Jublilee" [...] track from Cefn Gwyn along Cwm Caws for timber extraction.|$|R
50|$|A notable {{portion of}} the Columbia Trail is the Ken Lockwood Gorge, between Califon and High Bridge (2½ miles north of High Bridge). The South Branch of the Raritan River {{parallels}} the trail through the gorge, and is a scenic fast-flowing small river with recreational activities, especially fly fishing. A 60 ft <b>trestle</b> <b>carries</b> the trail over the river in the gorge.|$|R
5000|$|The current {{causeway}} {{was built}} in 1962. From west to east, the causeway is composed of twinned 2880 ft long concrete trestles, a 4700 ft long earth fill segment, and twinned 8800 ft long concrete trestles. The easternmost of the two bridges is the longer of the two and traffic reporters will sometimes refer to the two structures as the [...] "long bridge" [...] and the [...] "short bridge". Each <b>trestle</b> <b>carries</b> a 46 ft wide, three-lane roadway.|$|R
60|$|Small trees lay in tangled rows {{about the}} fresh gravel; farther back, the {{standing}} bush ran in a broken line against the fading light. In front, thin mist drifted across the muskeg where slender trunks {{rose from the}} quaking mud. Not far off a high, wooden <b>trestle</b> <b>carried</b> the rails across a ravine. The bridge would presently be rebuilt with steel, {{but in the meantime}} the frame was open and the gaps between the ties were wide.|$|R
50|$|Parking is {{available}} in a small lot just {{to the east of}} the station on the eastbound side (Lot 1) and a lot one block west of the station on the westbound side (Lot 4). There are also several signed areas along nearby streets, referred to as Lots 2 and 3. A motorist using Lot 4 must make one street crossing, walk under the metal <b>trestles</b> <b>carrying</b> the tracks over the street, and then walk fifty to a hundred yards to either the center or southside platform.|$|R
50|$|The <b>trestle</b> <b>carries</b> {{a single}} {{track of the}} BNSF Railway's Woodinville Subdivision line over a valley {{that used to be}} an {{extension}} of Lake Washington. The line runs approximately 40 mi from Renton in the south to Snohomish in the north. Before the abandonment of the rail line by BNSF, freight trains ran six days a week, including those carrying Boeing's aircraft fuselages to its assembly plant in Renton. It was also used daily by the popular Spirit of Washington Dinner Train, but this service ceased at the end of June 2007.|$|R
25|$|The Alburgh, Vermont – Rouses Point, New York rail trestle. From {{sometime}} in the late 19th century until 1964, this wooden <b>trestle</b> <b>carried</b> two railroads (the Rutland Railroad and the Central Vermont Railroad) over the lake {{just south of the}} US 2 vehicular bridge. The iron swing bridge at the center (over the navigation channel) has been removed. Most of the wooden pilings remain and can be seen looking south from the US 2 bridge. Part of the trestle on the Rouses Point side has been converted for use as an access pier associated with the local marina.|$|R
500|$|The route runs {{parallel}} to the Columbia River's bank, and the river is visible most of the way. [...] In a few places, the tracks are <b>carried</b> on low <b>trestles</b> over the water. [...] The line passes through the NRHP-listed Downtown Historic District, and its westernmost section passes under the Astoria–Megler Bridge. [...] To {{the east of the}} Maritime Museum, at 20thStreet, it passes a former Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway depot built in 1924. [...] The fare has always been $1, with an all-day pass available for $2. Around 2006, operation was extended east from 36thStreet to 39thStreet, making the line about [...] long.|$|R
50|$|Sunken Meadow State Parkway {{was built}} {{underneath}} Pulaski Road in the 1950s. It shares a cloverleaf interchange, {{which has the}} southernmost ramps squeezed tightly between the train <b>trestle</b> <b>carrying</b> the LIRR Port Jefferson line. From there on, {{the name of the}} road is immediately changed to East Northport Road. NYS Bike Route 25A rejoins CR 11 at Old Commack Road, and CR 11 ends at NY 25A just two blocks west of Church Street. Northeast of CR 11's terminus at NY 25A, the road turns into Old Dock Road and runs along {{the west side of the}} former Kings Park State Hospital until reaching the Nissequogue River.|$|R

50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{considered}} the worst evening commute in the Bay Area, which ended with {{the completion of a}} new eastern <b>trestle</b> <b>carrying</b> westbound bridge traffic in 2002. Eastbound bridge traffic took over the old trestle completely, although eastbound traffic was not expanded to three lanes until February 2003. Funded as part of BATA's regional Measure (RM) 1 program, which raised bridge tolls, the new low-rise trestle portion of the bridge added 10 ft shoulders on both sides in both directions and effectively widened traffic from four to six lanes, matching the configuration of the high-rise portion of the bridge. With the completion of the new westbound trestle, the speed limit on the bridge was raised to 65 mph.|$|R
5000|$|Now the {{wreckage}} of a shed or outhouse would move by, followed by a drowned swine or other livestock. The construction forces of the Texas & Pacific worked feverishly to safeguard the long <b>trestle</b> <b>carrying</b> their tracks across the stream. Suddenly, this whole structure turned on its side down-stream, broke loose {{from the rest of}} the track at one end and swung out into the middle of the current and began breaking up, first into large sections and then into smaller pieces, rushing madly along to some uncertain destination. half a dozen of the workmen fell into the torrent at this point; exaggerated reports of their drowning swept the city.

50|$|The Heart of Texas Railroad was {{organized}} in 2012 and acquired the 67.5 mi {{line from the}} bankrupt Gulf, Colorado and San Saba Railway in 2013. Operations began on January 29 of that year. On May 19, 2013, a 300 yd-long <b>trestle</b> <b>carrying</b> the tracks over the Colorado River about 10 mi west of Lometa burned and collapsed. The fire, of unknown origin, began {{on the western side}} of the trestle about 4 p.m.; by the time volunteer firefighters from Lometa arrived, the fire was uncontrollable. There were no injuries. At the time the potential loss to the company was estimated at $10 million. The company contracted with JCF Bridge & Concrete to replace the bridge, and the new span opened on May 16, 2014. The bridge cost $4 million.|$|R
50|$|Coney Island Creek extends eastward 1.8 mi from Gravesend Bay to Shell Road and {{separates}} {{the west end}} of Coney Island from the neighborhoods of Gravesend and Bath Beach. The west end of the creek is bordered by Coney Island Creek Park and Kaiser Park on the south side, and Calvert Vaux Park and Six Diamonds Park on the north side. The creek is crossed by the Cropsey Avenue and Stillwell Avenue bridges as well as two parallel rail <b>trestles</b> <b>carrying</b> the West End and Sea Beach Lines. The eastern end is bordered by the Shore Parkway on the north side and Neptune Avenue on the south side. Marine traffic is restricted by a cable net between Cropsey and Stillwell Avenues. The eastern portion of Coney Island Creek runs along private industrial property and several acres owned by Keyspan, the local electricity provider.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} located between Hobart Avenue, Chatham Road, and Station Plaza. The roads Crescent Place and Short Hills Avenue {{terminate}} {{at or near}} the station. A <b>trestle</b> <b>carries</b> trains over Short Hills Avenue. The relatively narrow opening of the trestle makes this intersection {{one of the most dangerous}} in all of Short Hills. The 1907 station had two buildings, one on each side of the double tracks. Today, however, only the building on the eastbound side (toward Hoboken and New York Penn Station) is in active use by New Jersey Transit; the westbound building houses the Millburn-Short Hills Historical Society. The eastbound building houses a waiting area, community bulletin board, a restroom, a small news stand, a restaurant, and a ticket office (normally open weekdays between 4:45 a.m. and 12:45 p.m., closed on weekends and holidays).|$|R
25|$|Several BFS {{personnel}} were honoured for their work. Jack Owen, a BFS officer and former Royal Marine, was awarded an MBE in 1963 following a tense incident at Bohldamm near Lüchow in Lower Saxony. The border ran along a stream, but its precise location was disputed. The West Germans considered {{the far side}} of the stream to be the location of the border, while the East Germans regarded the border as lying in the middle of the stream. An overgrown cobbled footbridge crossed the stream but was blocked by the East Germans with a movable barbed wire trestle barrier situated at the far end of the bridge. One day in 1962 the East Germans moved the barrier to the middle of the bridge, despite protests from West German border guards and customs officials. The situation escalated when the East Germans warned that they would shoot anyone who touched the trestle and backed up their warning by emplacing machine guns and armoured cars on their side of the stream. The West Germans called up a BFS platoon and a British Army section to back them up. Owen called the East Germans' bluff by walking onto the bridge with two British soldiers and <b>carrying</b> the <b>trestle</b> back to the eastern side of the stream. He then stood by it for the next eight hours to make sure that it would not be moved again.|$|R
50|$|The {{route of}} the line {{continued}} southward towards St. Thomas, passing through the villages of Scottsville, Tempo and Lynhurst. Tracks reached St. Thomas in July 1906. The Traction Line used the tracks of the St. Thomas Municipal Railway to navigate through the city streets. The line entered town on the west end and exited southward on the east end, crossing over the London and Port Stanley Railway via the street railway on Talbot Street in the process. Continuing southward, the line passed through the village of Union and entered Port Stanley via Colborne Street. The Traction Line station was {{on the east side}} of Port Stanley harbour, compared to the more extensive L&PS yards on the west side. The station was located directly off Colborne Street and still exists today. There was a spur line that ran behind the station down to the dock for loading fish and passengers. The line entered London via Baseline Road, and curved north towards downtown. A long <b>trestle</b> <b>carried</b> the line over the Thames River valley before terminating at the company's station on Horton Street.|$|R
50|$|Starting at {{the south}} end of the line in Guthrie, Oklahoma, the DE&G {{departed}} from the AT&SF mainline just north of downtown and curved northwestward, paralleling, then crossing the sand-choked Cimarron River on a long wooden pile bridge. The line continued northwestward through several small farming communities, servicing grain elevators. A high wooden <b>trestle</b> <b>carried</b> the railroad across Skeleton Creek. At Enid, Oklahoma, the line crossed the former Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (now Union Pacific Railroad) as well as two lines of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway. In Enid the former AT&SF brick freight depot houses the Railroad Museum of Oklahoma, across the street from the classic Tudor AT&SF passenger station. Between Jet and Cherokee, Oklahoma, the line crossed the western portion of the salt flats at Great Salt Plains Lake for several miles atop an earth berm fill. North of Cherokee it bridged the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River, including a long wooden trestle over the flood plain. At Kiowa, Kansas, the line terminated at a junction with the current BNSF Railway transcontinental line after passing through a cut about 10 ft deep.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} what really was 'Wigan Pier' goes that in 1891, an {{excursion}} train to Southport got delayed {{on the outskirts}} of Wigan not long after leaving Wallgate Station. At that time a long wooden gantry or <b>trestle</b> <b>carried</b> a mineral line from Lamb and Moore's Newtown Colliery on Scot Lane, to their Meadows Colliery in Frog Lane (where the Council refuse centre is now). This gantry was quite a structure, as it had to span the Douglas valley, crossing the river, the canal and the main rail line to Southport. As the delayed train waited for the signals to change, one of the travellers remarked [...] "where the b... hell are we?" [...] and the reply became the basis for the immortal joke about Wigan's Pier. George Formby, Sr. perpetuated the joke {{around the turn of the}} century in the music halls in Wigan, adding that when he passed the Pier he noticed the tide was in (referring to the constant flooding in the low-lying area). George died in December 1920, and with the demise of the collieries in the area, the gantry had long passed out of existence. Therefore when people looked for the Pier, the tippler for coal wagons at the canal terminus became the chosen object of the joke The tippler became the favoured location when people subsequently wanted to see it. There are references to it in songs such as George Formby Junior's On the Wigan Boat Express.|$|R
50|$|The trail {{begins as}} a {{continuation}} of the Snohomish River Trail at the intersection of Maple Avenue and Pine Street in Snohomish, named the Snohomish trailhead. The route travels northeast along Maple Avenue, which becomes Machias Road past Snohomish city limits, and the Pilchuck River to the Pilchuck trailhead, located south of an underpass of U.S. Route 2. The trail continues north into Machias, where it passes through the Machias and 20th Street trailheads before turning northwest as the railbed approaches Lake Stevens and an underpass of Washington State Route 92 and its trailhead. The Centennial Trail travels towards Lake Cassidy, where it passes the Rhododendron trailhead, named for the state flower, and the Lake Cassidy Wetlands Park trailhead. The trail continues northwest under 84th Street and Washington State Route 9, the former of which has its own trailhead. The route begins paralleling 67th Avenue NE as it enters the Quilceda Creek watershed at the Armar Road trailhead south of Arlington. The Centennial Trail and 67th Avenue enter Arlington city limits at an intersection with Washington State Route 531 before the roadway continues north into Downtown Arlington after an underpass with Washington State Route 9. The route continues through Downtown Arlington along West Avenue before a former railroad <b>trestle</b> <b>carries</b> the trail across the Stillaguamish River and towards Bryant along Washington State Route 9. The Centennial Trail passes its final trailhead, the Nakashima Heritage Barn & Centennial Trail North, before ending at the Skagit County line south of Lake McMurray.|$|R
