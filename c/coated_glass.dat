25|$|Biological {{tissue is}} often {{embedded}} in a resin block then thinned to less than 100nm on an ultramicrotome. The resin block is fractured as it passes over a glass or diamond knife edge. This method is used to obtain thin, minimally deformed samples that allow for the observation of tissue ultrastructure. Inorganic samples, such as aluminium, may also be embedded in resins and ultrathin sectioned in this way, using either <b>coated</b> <b>glass,</b> sapphire or larger angle diamond knives. To prevent charge build-up at the sample surface when viewing in the TEM, tissue samples need to be coated with {{a thin layer of}} conducting material, such as carbon.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} the {{building}} incorporates three setback features designed to provide visual continuity with the surrounding skyline, each reflecting {{the height of a}} nearby building. The first setback, {{on the east side of}} the building, aligns with the cornice line of the Wrigley Building to the east; the second, on the west side, aligns with River Plaza to the north and with the Marina City Towers to the west. The third setback, on the east side, relates to 330 North Wabash building (formerly known as IBM Plaza). However, some views distort the alignment of the second setback. The setbacks and rounded edges of the building combat vortex formation. The body of the building is raised [...] above the main Wabash entrance and [...] above the Chicago River.

New <b>glass</b> <b>coated</b> foam <b>glass</b> (Foamglas) insulating tiles have been tested by several standard tests (UNI Iso, ASTM) to define their suitability for energy saving buildings: impact tests, thermal shock resistance, wear resistance, water absorption, frost resistance, resistance to stains.

2500|$|Most {{light bulbs}} have either clear or <b>coated</b> <b>glass.</b> The <b>coated</b> <b>glass</b> bulbs have a white powdery {{substance}} {{on the inside}} called kaolin. Kaolin, or kaolinite, is a white, chalky clay in a very fine powder form, that is blown in and electrostatically deposited on {{the interior of the}} bulb. It diffuses the light emitted from the filament, producing a more gentle and evenly distributed light. Manufacturers may add pigments to the kaolin to adjust the characteristics of the final light emitted from the bulb. Kaolin diffused bulbs are used extensively in interior lighting because of their comparatively gentle light. Other kinds of colored bulbs are also made, including the various colors used for [...] "party bulbs", Christmas tree lights and other decorative lighting. These are created by coloring the glass with a dopant; which is often a metal like cobalt (blue) or chromium (green). Neodymium-containing glass is sometimes used to provide a more natural-appearing light.|$|E

40|$|A <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> was {{prepared}} onto AISI {{304 stainless steel}} by a slurry-spraying technique {{and its effects on}} oxidation behavior of this steel was investigated at 1250 degrees C in air. Results were compared with those for bare specimens. The <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> decreased the weight gain by 98 % after oxidation for 9 h, and oxidation kinetics of 304 stainless steel was changed to linear behavior due to the coating. Steel loss of the coated specimens was reduced by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude. Hot stage microscopic, optical, XRD and SEM-EDX analyses revealed that the as-received coating melted at high temperature, to form self-healing, homogeneous <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> which acted as a perfect oxygen diffusion barrier and prevented the breakaway oxidation of 304 stainless steel. During cooling, the <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> spalled because of CTE mismatch between coating and the steel. This <b>glass</b> <b>coating</b> by low-cost and easy handling method is potentially applicable during slab reheating of stainless steel. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Thin film {{layers of}} silica with calcium or {{magnesium}} ions were {{prepared by the}} sol–gel method {{in order to obtain}} protective coatings with low water affinity for historical glasses. The films were synthesised by pre-polymerised solutions of tetraethoxysilane [Si(OC 2 H 5) 4] (TEOS) and deposited by dipping soda-lime glasses. Then they were immersed in saturated solutions of Ca(OH) 2 or Mg(OH) 2 for time intervals of 1, 24 and 36 h to adsorb calcium or magnesium ions. No heat treatment was done, to apply this method to cover real historical glasses, which could be irreversibly damaged by high temperature. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and secondary ions mass spectrometry analyses show that the films present an almost homogeneous in depth distribution of calcium or magnesium. Magnesium adsorbed films also present a decrease of free non-bridging oxygen (SiOH groups). By atomic force microscopy it was observed that the average roughness is low (around 10 AA). Contact angle measurements reveal a degree increase starting from soda-lime uncoated <b>glasses,</b> through silica <b>coated</b> <b>glasses</b> up to calcium or magnesium adsorbed silica <b>coated</b> <b>glasses.</b> The data obtained revealed a real decrease of water affinity, strictly important to improve the protective performances of the films. 2003 Elsevier B.
