Firstly, a small commercial and residential development was built over {{the site of the}} former Grange Road railway station in Crawley Down and the trackbed leading eastwards from there has been built on. To avoid this, for a distance of approximately 1,000 m, the Worth Way travels over local roads within a housing estate from just east of B2028 Turners Hill Road to Cobb Close where it rejoins the former railway bed alignment. Secondly, at Compasses Corner (formerly Compasses <b>Crossing</b> <b>level</b> crossing) on Wallage Lane the trackbed as far as the M23 has been reused as a landfill site, the original railway alignment being marked by a line of trees. Here the Worth Way continues along Turners Hill Road for 150 m before turning off to join a bridleway which passes through a farm to reach a bridge over the M23 which leads into the urban sprawl of Worth, now a suburb of Crawley, following local roads to rejoin the railway alignment near Church Road.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} a novel adaptive continuous beam steering (ACBS) solution for quasi-optical antenna technologies. The main advantages of this solution compared to discontinuous beam switching approaches are small steering angle steps (high resolution), improved beam <b>crossing</b> <b>level</b> and lower RF losses. This solution {{is based on}} a phase correcting aperture transfer function and the relation between a focal array amplitude tapering and its phase center displacement. The proposed solution is verified by comparing its results with 3 D full-wave simulations. With a 2 x 2 focal source array illuminating a Fresnel dielectric lens, it is possible to achieve a scanning range of 1. 6 ° with a steering angle step of 0. 3 ° and a beam <b>crossing</b> <b>level</b> of 0. 2 dB.

This method allows simultaneously a large angular coverage, high <b>crossing</b> <b>level</b> and low side lobes levels (SLLs) for a lossless multi-beam antenna system. To validate the proposed concept a SIW (Substrate Integrated Waveguide) pillbox antenna with two radiating apertures was designed at 24. 15 GHz and fabricated with a standard PCB fabrication process. The measured results of the realized prototype are in good agreement with the simulated ones.

40|$|The present work investigates two {{properties}} of level crossings of a stationary Gaussian process X(t) with autocorrelation function R_X(τ). We show firstly that if R_X(τ) admits finite {{second and fourth}} derivatives at the origin, the length of up-excursions above a large negative level -γ is asymptotically exponential as -γ→ -∞. Secondly, assuming that R_X(τ) admits a finite second derivative at the origin and some defined properties, we derive {{the mean number of}} crossings as well as the length of successive excursions above two subsequent large levels. The asymptotic results are shown to be effective even for moderate values of <b>crossing</b> <b>level.</b> An application of the developed results is proposed to derive the probability of successive excursions above adjacent levels during a time window...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the study of death processes with time-homogeneous non-linear death rates. An explicit formula is obtained for the joint distribution of the state XT and the variable Sa ∫T 0 g(Xt) dt, where g is any given real function and T corresponds to some appropriate stopping time. This is achieved by constructing a family of martingales and then by using a particular family of Abel-Gontcharoff pseudopolynomials (the theory of which has been introduced in a companion paper) and related Abelian-type expansions. Moreover, the distribution of the first <b>crossing</b> <b>level</b> of such a death process through a general upper boundary is also evaluated in terms of pseudopolynomials of that kind. The flexibility of the methods developed makes easy the extension to multidimensional death processes. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|We tackle an {{important}} although rarely addressed question of accounting {{for a variety}} of asymmetries frequently observed in stochastic temporal/spatial records.

We utilize those asymmetry measures to demonstrate how a class of second-order models built on the skewed Laplace distributions can account for sample path asymmetries. It is shown that these models are capable of mimicking not only distributional skewness but also more complex geometrical asymmetries in the sample path such as tilting, front-back slope asymmetry and time irreversibility. Simple moment-based estimation techniques are briefly discussed to allow direct application to modelling and fitting actual records...|$|E

40|$|The Ensemble Interval Histogram (EIH) is an {{auditory}} model {{which can}} be used as a robust "front-end" for speech recognition systems. The utilization of multiple level-crossing detectors in the EIH provides frequency and intensity information, which may be useful for speech processing.

In this paper, an analytic relationship is developed for variance and SNR of the level-crossing intervals as a function of the <b>crossing</b> <b>level</b> value, and a new feature extraction method based on zero-crossings with peak amplitudes is proposed for robust speech recognition in noisy environments.

40|$|International audienceA novel dual-layer multibeam pillbox antenna with {{a slotted}} {{waveguide}} radiating part in substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) technology is proposed. In contrast to previous works, the design {{goal is to have}} a multibeam antenna with arbitrary low sidelobes {{and at the same time}} a high <b>crossing</b> <b>level</b> between adjacent radiated beams. These two constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously for any passive and lossless multibeam antenna systems with a single radiating aperture due to beam orthogonality. Here, this limitation is overcome using the “split aperture decoupling” method which consists in using two radiating apertures. Each aperture is associated with a pillbox quasi-optical system with several integrated feed horns in its focal plane so as to steer the main beam in the azimuthal plane. The antenna operates at 24. 15 GHz and presents very good scanning performance over an angular sector of ± 40 °, with a good agreement between full-wave simulations and measurements. The crossover level between adjacent beams is about - 3 dB with a sidelobe level lower than - 24 dB for the central beam and better than - 11 dB for the extreme beam positions.
