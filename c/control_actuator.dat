One way of improving the performance of actuators is to go from a pneumatic <b>controlled</b> <b>actuator</b> to an electrically <b>controlled</b> <b>actuator.</b> Electrically <b>controlled</b> <b>actuators</b> are faster, more accurate and have a lower maintenance cost but are more complex and harder to control. In this thesis two methods for <b>controlling</b> an electric <b>actuator</b> is proposed. The actuator is a BLDC driven throttle valve used for controlling the air intake for a diesel engine where a precise amount of air is wanted to maintain optimal combustion in the engine. The proposed control methods are a PI position controller and a cascade controller consisting of three different controllers.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to control flexible robots. Many control schemes for flexible robots have been developed and published in robotics research literature. All of them assume the use of torque <b>controlled</b> <b>actuators</b> (DC-motors), while most commercially available robots have velocity <b>controlled</b> <b>actuators.</b> It is possible to extend a traditional controller, which uses velocity <b>controlled</b> <b>actuators</b> and which is designed to control rigid robots, to a controller for flexible robots. However, it is shown that the high gain velocity loop introduces a controllability problem. The proposed control approach is based on state feedback, built around a high gain velocity <b>controlled</b> <b>actuator.</b> The total dynamic model consists of a parallel combination of the models relating the differential velocity input to the joint position {{on the one hand and}} relating the differential velocity input to the flexible deformation on the other. This structure is proven to solve the controllability problem. By state feedback together with feedforward, accurate tracking, proper positioning and oscillation suppression during and after positioning of the end point are achieved. Test results on a bread board model prove the applicability of the proposed control scheme. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work, an {{economic}} model predictive control (EMPC) {{system is designed}} that accounts for {{the dynamics of the}} control actuators. A combined process-actuator dynamic model is developed to describe the process and <b>control</b> <b>actuator</b> dynamics and is used within the EMPC system. Integrating the design of the regulatory control layer, which controls the control actuators, and the supervisory control layer consisting of an EMPC system is an important consideration given the fact that EMPC may force an unsteady-state operating policy to optimize the process economics and the dynamics of the <b>control</b> <b>actuator</b> layer may affect the closed-loop process-actuator dynamics. Moreover, integral or average input constraints are often imposed within the EMPC solution. However, if the actuator layer is not accounted for in the EMPC system, the actuator output trajectory may not satisfy the integral input constraints. To address closed-loop stability of the combined process-actuator closed-loop system, stability constraints, designed via Lyapunov-based techniques, are imposed on the EMPC problem to guarantee closed-loop stability of the process system under the EMPC. An EMPC system accounting for the <b>control</b> <b>actuator</b> dynamics is applied to a benchmark chemical process example to study the impact of the actuator dynamics on closed-loop economic performance and reactant material constraint satisfaction...|$|E

Loading actuators are thus used, that develop a controlled force on the flight control actuators under test, while these actuators are commanded to move replicating typical flight profiles. A critical issue with these force control systems {{is the ability to}} maintain a good accuracy for the load while the flight <b>control</b> <b>actuator</b> is moving with high speed and acceleration.

This note presents the initial part of an ongoing research project aimed at developing a prognostic and health management system for fly-by-wire primary flight <b>control</b> <b>actuators.</b> A key feature of the project is to develop a PHM system for these actuators suitable for the flight <b>control</b> <b>actuators</b> of legacy airplanes, which are poised to operate for still a long time, and not only for those of new aircraft. The primary flight <b>control</b> <b>actuators</b> of fly-by-wire flight control systems of existing aircraft are electrohydraulic servoactuators with a typical configuration and complement of transducers, and there is no practical possibility of introducing additional sensors. For this reason, the research activity was directed towards the study of algorithms able to identify faults only by using the already available information of the servoactuators state variables. The implemented algorithms are a combination of mathematical and neural network based ones, and the identification of degradations was performed by the analysis of the response of the servoactuators to a sequence of selected stimuli provided in preflight or postflight. The servovalve current and the feedback position are processed by dedicated algorithms in order to obtain significant indicators of the servocatuator health condition. The values of the indicators obtained during the sequence of stimuli are analyzed in combination with those obtained in the past. This is performed by the neural network part of the algorithm which allows a reliable identification of presence and of type of a degradation. The results obtained from the initial part of the research activity are interesting and encouraging. Individual degradations of the servoactuator parameters have so far been addressed and the algorithms for identifying them have been developed. All that makes up the foundations of the future research activity which will be focused on analyzing the effects of simultaneous multiple degradations and to the estimation of the remaining useful lif...|$|R
