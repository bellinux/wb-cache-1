40|$|<b>Crimean</b> Congo <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> virus (CCHFV) is a tick borne {{nairovirus}} {{responsible for}} a highly fatal human disease with increased recent incidence within the human population of southern Europe. Hazara virus (HAZV), another tick borne nairovirus of the same serogroup as CCHFV, is not pathogenic in humans, but infection with HAZV results in a similar disease progression in interferon receptor knockout mice to CCHFV. In order to investigate further similarities between HAZV and CCHFV, and to {{support the use of}} HAZV as a model for CCHFV infection, various structural and cell biological aspects of the CCHFV and HAZV replication cycle were investigated. We present the X-ray crystal structure of the nucleocapsid protein (N) of HAZV at a resolution of 2. 7 Å, and the crystal structure of RNA-bound HAZV N at a resolution of 3 Å. HAZV N had a highly similar overall structure to CCHFV N, consisting of a globular domain containing amino acid residues from both the N and the C-termini, and an extended arm domain. A crevice within the globular domain of HAZV N had 3 nucleotides of RNA bound, in the RNA-bound HAZV N structure. RNA binding is a crucial function of HAZV N and CCHFV N, and the identification of an RNA binding site in HAZV N provides a model for the structure guided design of anti-virals to disrupt this interaction. Cellular heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) was found to be an interacting partner of the N protein of CCHFV and HAZV, both in cells and in secreted HAZV particles. The functional role of this interacting partner within the HAZV replication cycle was investigated using siRNA knock down and small molecule inhibitors of endogenous HSP 70. HAZV induced apoptosis in SW 13 cells, and HAZV N was cleaved during a 72 hr time course of infection. The data presented here also reveals new insights into the replication cycles of HAZV and CCHFV. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Crimean</b> Congo <b>Haemorrhagic</b> <b>Fever</b> (CCHF) is {{an acute}} fatal viral {{infection}} {{caused by a}} virus from Bunyaviridae family, genus Nairovirus. The virus has been isolated from at least 31 species of ticks: among them Hyalomma species {{are the most important}} vectors. Geographically, CCHF is a widespread viral infection. Its mortality rate in Iran has been estimated to be 29. 6 and 11. 9 % in 1999 and 2000, respectively. The majority of CCHF cases could be prevented. However, in order to identify and prioritize areas for prevention, to the best of authors` knowledge to date, no systematic study has been carried out in Fars province, Iran, to assess the extent, frequency and major outcomes of this fatal infection. The current descriptive retrospective case series study was, therefore, undertaken to address some of these issues. Data on CCHF cases for a period of four years (2001 - 4) were collected from different official sources in Iran. Data were categorized and analyzed by SPSS software, version 13 / 5. Gender, age, occupation, seasonal distribution and outcome of the disease were considered in data analysis. A total of 45 cases had been registered during the study period of which 29 were suspected and 16 were confirmed cases. CCHF was more common in men (85. 5 %) than in women (14. 5 %). Similarly, the disease was more prevalent in the 20 - 29 years old age group (37. 5 %). Nineteen cases (42 %) resulted in death. Seasonal distribution of the infection revealed that it was more common in spring (37. 5 %). Additionally, 38 % of the CCHF cases occurred among butchers, slaughterhouse workers, farmers and shepherds. The case fatality rates for the suspected and confirmed cases were 55. 1 and 18. 75 %, respectively. Data gathered from different areas of Fars province showed that out of the 18 species identified to be the potential vectors of CCHF, 13 exist in this geographical area. In conclusion, the observation that butchers, slaughterhouse workers, farmers and shepherds form the most commonly affected occupations, indicate areas where preventive interventions, in particular health education efforts, might be usefully targeted...|$|R
40|$|Emerging and re-emerging {{infectious}} diseases (ERID) {{are capable of}} generating sizable economic loss, and causing loss of life and social instability. To prevent and mitigate the negative impacts of ERID, {{it is imperative to}} have a sensitive surveillance system for early disease detection. Furthermore, from the economic perspective, resources are always scarce and have opportunity cost, so investment in surveillance programs has to demonstrate that it can maximize the utility of available resources. The thesis was focused on development and application of a software toolbox, Human and Animal Disease Response Program (HandiResponse), designed for (i) visualizing the disease risk landscape and representing spatial variation in the expected occurrence of a zoonotic disease both quantitatively and visually; (ii) evaluating economic benefit and costs of a single surveillance activity or a multi-component portfolio; (iii) identifying optimal use of resources for surveillance. It comprises four modules: (i) risk map development – HandiMap; (ii) surveillance portfolio development – HandiSurv; (iii) economic impact assessment – HandiEcon and (iv) surveillance optimization – OptiSurv. The modules developed were tested on a number of data sets from various countries. The experience demonstrated that using satellite-derived data in combination with national statistical data to produce a disease risk map improved spatial prediction of avian influenza H 5 N 1 outbreaks in southern Vietnam. Development of a risk map from satellite data for <b>Crimean</b> Congo <b>Haemorrhagic</b> <b>Fever</b> for Mongolia guided a field surveillance program which provided the first evidence that this disease is present in both animals and people in Mongolia. Finally an invented disease affecting pigs and people was used to investigate the likely consequences of an incursion of such a novel disease into Australia, involving both domestic and feral pigs and transferring to people. Risk-based and classical disease surveillance options were then tested for disease detection, and modelling work confirmed that a portfolio consisting of different options was the most technically and economically appropriate. HandiResponse is a practical tool that could promote the implementation of risk-based surveillance approaches, and improve both technical and economic efficiency of surveillance programs for {{infectious diseases}}, particularly those affecting both people and animals...|$|R

40|$|<b>Crimean</b> Congo <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> virus (CCHFV) is a negative-strand RNA virus {{belonging}} to the genus Nairovirus of the Bunyaviridae family. The virus is present in about 30 countries and it is maintained in vertical and horizontal transmission cycles involving ixodid ticks {{and a variety of}} wild and domestic vertebrates, which do not show signs of illness. In particular, ticks of the genus Hyalomma seem to be the principal vectors and play an important role as a natural reservoir. Human infections begin with nonspecific febrile symptoms that progress to a serious haemorrhagic syndrome with a high case fatality rate. To date, no specific treatment or vaccine are available and prevention of human disease depends merely on avoiding bites from infected ticks and contact with infected blood or tissues. Despite a wide distribution, the pathogenesis of CCHF remains poorly understood, because of limited human pathology and the need for biosafety level 4 facilities. The major pathological abnormalities of CCHF are alteration of vascular barrier function and haemorrhage. Endothelial damage can contribute to coagulopathy but it is still unknown whether vascular dysfunction is due to a direct effect of virus on the endothelial cells or to a consequence of a cytokine storm. Indeed, elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (such as TNF-α, IL- 6, IL- 10) and serum markers of vascular activation (sICAM- 1 and sVCAM- 1) have been detected in fatal CCHF cases. In vitro experiments in human target cell lines have shown that CCHFV induces apoptosis late post infection and the release of TNF-α, IL- 6 and IL- 8, with the activation of endothelial cells. Although CCHFV is sensitive to type I interferons in vitro at the early stage of infection, IFN has no significant activity against an already established CCHFV infection, suggesting that CCHFV strongly counteracts IFN signalling. It has been demonstrated that CCHFV employs a range of strategies to evade and counteract the innate immune response to establish viral infection. Despite an improved knowledge of the viral biology and {{a better understanding of the}} disease clinical aspects, there are still many gaps to be filled. In this context, our research is focused on the study of vector-virus interaction and on the development of innovative vaccine approaches based on virus like particles/recombinant viruses for the control and prevention of human disease...|$|R

Data were collected through systematic literature review in a database from which maps of geographic distribution of ticks, CCHF virus and ASF virus were issued. The main vectors for CCHF are Hyalomma spp, Increase in the number of fragmented areas and the degradation of agricultural lands to bush lands are the two main factors in the creation of new foci of CCHF in endemic areas. Movement of livestock and wildlife species, which may carry infected ticks, contributes to the spread of the infection. The Middle East and Balkan countries are the most likely sources of introduction of CCHFV into other European countries. All the Ornithodoros species investigated so far can become infective with ASF virus and are perhaps biological vectors. These ticks are important in maintaining the local foci of the ASFV, but do not play an active role in the geographical spread of the virus. Wild boars have never been found infested by Ornithodoros spp. because wild boars normally do not rest inside protected burrows, but above the ground.
