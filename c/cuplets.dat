They were often woven into certain hairstyles and were quite inexpensive. In the royal court, women sometimes wore <b>cuplets</b> filled with perfume. They were worn to also keep out head lice and protected the head when doing dangerous things.|$|E
5000|$|In Standard German, ancient Germanic au und ai {{have been}} preserverd. However, Standard German later merged Germanic ū and ī with these diphthongs, which {{occurred}} neither in Bönnsch nor Kölsch. Therefore, some Standard German rhyming <b>cuplets</b> {{do not exist}} in the Ripuarian dialects. For example, standard heiß ~ weiß vs. Bönnsch heeß ~ wieß (English [...] "hot" [...] and [...] "white"); standard kaufen ~ saufen vs. Bönnsch koofe ~ suffe (English [...] "buy" [...] and [...] "drink").|$|E

40|$|In 1997, D. Diakonov et al. using a soliton model {{predicted}} a SU(3) F flavor antide-cuplet of pentaquarks. The most striking prediction using this symmetry {{group is a}} narrow exotic state, E+(1540), which has quark component uuddg. If such a state is confirmed, {{other members of the}} antide <b>cuplet</b> could be expected to have sufficiently narrow widths to be observed as well. The Jefferson Laboratory experiment E 04 - 012 focused on the search for EO and NO partner states in the missing mass spectra of the H(e,e'K+) X and H(e,e'ir+) X channels. In addition, if the 8 + has non-zero isospin then a hypothetical isospin partner, O++, might be expected in the H(e,e'K-) X channel; this was also investigated. The experiment was performed in Hall A at Jefferson Lab using a 5 GeV electron beam incident on a liquid hydrogen target. The two high resolution magnetic spectrometers were coupled to septum magnets to allow measurement of scattered electrons and outgoing hadrons at angles as small as 6 degrees. The missing mass resolution was determined to be 3. 5 MeV/c 2 FWHM using neutron, A(1116) and E(1193) production and provided a high sensitivity to narrow resonances. A precise measurement of the A(1520) resonance has also been conducted for a cross-section comparison. As a result, no significant narrow resonances were observed in any of the three reaction channels being investigated. Based on this fact, a likelihood scan using the G. Feldman and R. Cousins method was performed. The analysis provided total cross section upper limits at 90 % confidence level with no lower limits or always below background fluctuation. by Yi Qiang.
