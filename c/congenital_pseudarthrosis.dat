In the later stages of the work, in addition to the construction of periosteal tube grafts, pseudarthroses were induced in the middle third of each canine tibia in order to see if hypertrophy would occur under the stress of weightbearing.

40|$|<b>Congenital</b> “ <b>pseudarthrosis</b> of the tibia is {{improperly}} named because, {{whereas the}} underlying abnormalities are constantly seen at birth, the fracture and subsequent pseudarthrosis {{are not necessarily}} present. Nevertheless the fracture commonly follows within the first eighteen months; sometimes it is delayed until trivial injury in childhood fractures the tibia which fails to unite. We wish to emphasise {{the importance of this}} latent period, during which bone grafting may prevent pseudarthrosis from developing and so avoid the formidable task of late repair. Although our patients are few, and the results not wholly satisfactory, we consider that our experience is worth reporting. THE RECOGNITION AND URGENCY OF PRE-PSEUDARTHROSIS The tibia at birth may be bowed in any direction. Provided the curvature is not anterior, osteotomy may be performed safely, although this is seldom necessary because gradual spontaneous correction is the rule. Anterior angulation may be associated with other abnormalities such as aplasia or dysplasia of the fibula or the fifth ray, shortening and thickening of the tibia and a skin dimple over the apex of the curve. This is less likely to straighten spontaneously but may also be corrected by osteotomy without misgiving in order to aid, for example, the fitting of a prosthesis after Syme’s amputation...|$|R
30|$|Patient PW was a 48 -year-old male triathlete who had {{bilateral}} os acromiale, {{but only}} the left side was locally symptomatic. The acromion was sensitive on palpitation and after swimming. All impingement signs were negative and the ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed marked oedema at the os acromiale but did not reveal any rotator cuff tendinopathy. The patient was first treated with local conservative therapy. This included physical therapy with ice and an infiltration of the os acromial joint with Kenacort and Xylocaine 2 %. This gave immediate pain relief for a few hours. Conservative treatment was unsuccessful, meaning that an operation was necessary. In this case, nine screws (2.7 - and 3.5 -mm) were used. Six anterior angle-stable screws were necessary. Posteriorly two cortical screws (one of which was used for compression) and two angle-stable locking screws were used. Because of the <b>congenital</b> or primary <b>pseudarthrosis,</b> an osteotomy of 1  mm was performed {{on each side of}} the osseous non-union including the cranial osteophytes.

40|$|Background: <b>Congenital</b> <b>pseudarthrosis</b> {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} challenges of paediatric orthopaedic practice. Treatment options and literature addressing this condition are numerous, reflecting the difficulty in management. We aimed to study the effectiveness of free fibula transfer as a primary modality of treatment in children with this condition in terms of achieving length, union, and normal axis of the involved leg. Materials and Methods: During the period of 2001 to 2010, 26 children with <b>congenital</b> <b>pseudarthrosis</b> of tibia between age group of 2 - 8 years were evaluated and were reconstructed using contra-lateral free fibula graft, and then patients were followed up for 5 years subsequently. Patients were examined and time of bony union, weight bearing ability and walking without support were noted. Any complication directly or indirectly related to surgery with any complication seen in the due course of follow up of 5 years was also taken care of. Results: In our experience with treatment of <b>congenital</b> <b>pseudarthrosis</b> over a span of 10 years with free fibula transfer, the results have been gratifying with no flap loss. All our patients had UNEVENTFUL post-op recovery. Only 2 patients out of 26 had non-union, for which cancellous bone grafting was done (7. 6 %). Most of the patients were ambulatory with support by 3 - 6 months and continued to walk without support after a span of 18 - 24 months. The incidence of stress fracture in our study over the follow-up period was 4 out of 26 pts (15. 3 %). None of them had any deformity in the donor leg. Conclusion: When compared to other surgical modalities of treatment of the problem in question, vascularised free fibula transfer has emerged as a real saviour with good patient compliance and less complication rate in our study. It achieves the desired target with no residual deformities and near normal to normal gait with no stigma of bone removal from other leg...|$|E
40|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>pseudarthrosis</b> {{of the leg}} {{remains one}} of the most {{controversial}} pediatric entities in terms of etiopathogenesis, pathology, treatment, and prognosis. The authors reviewed the pathologic material of 24 patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>pseudarthrosis</b> of the leg along with clinical and radiographic data. The tibia was affected in 22 patients; in two patients the disease was limited to the fibula. Fifteen patients were male and nine were female. Age at surgery ranged from 1 to 26 years. Nineteen patients were classified as having dysplastic type, one cystic, and four mixed. Clinical evidence of neurofibromatosis type I (NF-I) was found in 17 patients. The main histopathologic change observed was the growth of a highly cellular, fibromatosis-like tissue. In the dysplastic type, such tissue was associated with the periosteum. In the cystic type, a closely similar tissue occupied the lytic area. In case classified as of mixed type, the coexistence of endosteal/medullary and periosteal involvement by the fibromatosis-like tissue was observed. In the cystic lesion, evidence of de novo bone formation within the lesional tissue was obvious. Overall, the histologic features of the cystic lesion were similar to those of osteofibrous dysplasia. In the dysplastic type, the proliferation of the fibrovascular tissue was associated with active osteoclastic resorption of the cortex, which remodeled into a trabecular rather than a compact type of structure. Histologic comparison of the pathologic samples of patients with and without NF-I revealed no significant differences. The pseudarthrosis gap was continuous with periosteal soft tissues and filled by fibrous tissue, fibrocartilage, and hyaline cartilage with features of enchondral ossification. The authors suggest that the clinical diversity of <b>congenital</b> <b>pseudarthrosis</b> of the leg results from the diverse location of a single pathologic process [...] namely the growth of an abnormal, fibromatosis-like tissue either within the periosteum or within the endosteal/marrow tissues. It is tempting to suggest that such an "osteofibromatosis" represent a skeletal expression of neurofibromatosis, either within the fully expressed syndrome (patients with known neurofibromatosis) or as isolated lesion (patients with unknown/cryptic neurofibromatosis) ...|$|E

The analysis of complex research (anamnestic, clinical, radiological, physiological, morphological) of 190 patients with CPT. Results. It {{was found that the}} causes of disease are: neurofibromatosis, myelodysplasia and fibrous dysplasia. In neurofibromatosis and myelodysplasia in the basis for false joints there are neurotrophic disorders. Typically a latent pseudarthrosis occurs at birth with the progression of deformity and thinning of the affected bone. Provoking factor of pseudarthrosis is a pathological fracture. Deformities, limb shortening, significant thinning and sclerosis of ends of bone fragments, degenerative changes in bone tissue throughout the diaphysis and epiphysis, lowered bone growth, weak ossification at the ends of bone fragments up to complete absence are observed. In fibrous dysplasia the provoking factor is a pathological fracture. The ends of the bone fragments are thickened, sclerotic, they reveal foci of fibrous dysplasia. Conclusion. It was found that two groups of CPT are: neurotrophic and dysplastic types. Neurotrophic CPT develops against neurofibromatosis and myelodysplasia, dysplasric one - against fibrous dysplasia.

It is usually associated with an autosomal dominant disorder, neurofibromatosis type 1 (von Recklinghausen’s disease). Mutation of the NF 1 gene on chromosome 17 causes von Recklinghausen’s disease. The NF 1 gene is a tumour suppressor gene; it encodes a protein, neurofibromin, which modulates signal transduction through the ras GTPase pathway.

30|$|The Ilizarov method showed higher union {{rates in}} {{treating}} <b>congenital</b> <b>pseudarthrosis</b> of the tibia [28, 54].

40|$|Treatment of <b>congenital</b> <b>pseudarthrosis</b> of the tibia {{is still}} controversial, and vascularised fibula graft is a {{reliable}} method for consolidation, although complications {{can occur in}} the donor leg after fibula grafting. This study evaluates 16 patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>pseudarthrosis</b> of the tibia (CPT) treated with contralateral fibular graft, with regard to complications in the donor leg, and assesses the influence of distal tibiofibular joint arthrodesis in these complications. All patients with CPT were consecutively submitted to surgical treatment with contralateral fibular graft. The mean follow-up was 94 months, varying from 44 to 162 months. The long-term effects in the donor leg were determined, and 12 cases with distal tibiofibular arthrodesis (group 1) were compared with a group without arthrodesis (group 2).

30|$|Historically, the {{treatment}} of <b>congenital</b> <b>pseudarthrosis</b> is extremely challenging, as {{it is difficult to}} obtain and maintain a solid union.

They were abandoned in favour of more rigid intramedullary rodding procedures or Ilizarov circular frame fixation [10], often combined with extensive autologous grafting. However, due to the extent of the affected bone, large resections often create large defects to be reconstructed.

30|$|Patients with {{congenital}} shortenings are {{at higher}} risk of deficient bone formation, reflected in {{a higher risk of}} fracture after fixator removal.

Bone fragility is present in more than 100 different genetic disorders including skeletal dysplasias [26]. Among these, achondroplasia patients are by far the most common candidates for limb lengthening procedures, and they are known to tolerate these procedures relatively well. Another, much more difficult patient group is neurofibromatosis (and <b>congenital</b> <b>pseudarthrosis</b> not related to this disorder).

40|$|SummaryIntroductionIn pediatrics, Masquelet's induced {{membrane}} reconstructive {{technique has}} mainly {{been used in}} the context of cancer surgery reconstruction or <b>congenital</b> <b>pseudarthrosis</b> of the tibia. This retrospective study consisted of a series of pediatric patients where bone defects were reconstructed with this technique. Materials and methodsBetween 2006 and 2011, 14 children underwent bone reconstruction using this technique in the context of trauma, tumor resection or <b>congenital</b> <b>pseudarthrosis.</b> The mean age was 10. 6 years (range: 12 to 17 years) at the time of reconstruction. The length of the defect to be reconstructed relative to the length of the bone (index of reconstruction, expressed as a percentage) and bone healing was evaluated on standard radiographs. Complications were recorded. ResultsThe mean index of reconstruction was 32. 8 % (range: 13. 9 to 51 %). The mean follow-up was 30 months (range: 1 to 63). Bone union was achieved in 9. 5 months (range: 2 to 25). Complications mainly consisted of non-union in 35 % of cases, which consolidated after grafting and rigid fixation. Two cases of wound dehiscence were noted. Massive graft resorption occurred in a single case. DiscussionA technical error was identified in each non-union case (insufficient cement overlap of the bone ends or fixation not stiff enough). These long defects required a large volume of autograft, which constitutes the limiting factor especially in very young children. We used allograft bone chips or a tibial bone strut to increase the graft volume in the largest reconstructions. In this pediatric-only series, an average of one-third of the bone length was successfully reconstructed. Although the technique appears simple, it must be performed rigorously to ensure the cement sufficiently overlaps the bone ends and the defect is properly stabilized to prevent non-union, which is the main complication.
