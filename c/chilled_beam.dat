50|$|<b>Chilled</b> <b>beam</b> cooling systems require {{water to}} be treated by heating and cooling systems. Generally, water in a passive <b>chilled</b> <b>beam</b> system is cooled to about 16 to 19 C. In active <b>chilled</b> <b>beam</b> heating systems, water {{temperature}} is usually 40 to 50 C. (<b>Chilled</b> <b>beam</b> heating systems usually cannot rely solely on convection, however, and often require a fan-driven primary air circulation system to force the warmer air to the ground where most people sit and work.) There are effectiveness and cost {{differences between the two}} systems. Passive <b>chilled</b> <b>beam</b> systems can supply about 5.6 to 6.5 watts per foot (60 to 70 watts per metre) of cooling capacity. Active <b>chilled</b> <b>beam</b> systems are about twice as effective. In both cases, convection is so efficient that the ratio of incoming air to heated/cooled air can be as high as 6:1. However, studies of the energy cost-savings of active versus passive <b>chilled</b> <b>beam</b> systems remained inconclusive as of 2007, and appear to be highly dependent on the specific building.|$|E

The elements include quality, service, technical performance, technical knowledge, communication, time of delivery, installation, calculation program, flexibility, market adjustment, technical documentation, relationships and geographic distance. The {{study has been}} conducted employing a combination of both a quantitative and a qualitative approach in which a questionnaire has been sent out to Fläkt Woods’ customers in order to shed light on their opinions. The results showed that most of Fläkt Woods’ customers are satisfied or even very satisfied with the elements that were investigated. The elements that the customers were most satisfied with concerning the <b>chilled</b> <b>beams</b> were quality, service and technical knowledge. They believe that Fläkt Woods’ products have a good finish, that they are easy to get in touch with, that they are able and willing to give quick answers and feedback and that they have great knowledge about their <b>chilled</b> <b>beams.</b> The element that the customers are least satisfied with and that Fläkt Woods need to improve is flexibility. Even if Fläkt Woods believe that their special solutions are flexible, their customers do not fully agree. The customers’ attitude towards the flexibility is that Fläkt Woods prefer to provide standard solutions of <b>chilled</b> <b>beams</b> rather than offering special solutions. The results also showed that Fläkt Woods’ competitors are one step ahead considering the design of <b>chilled</b> <b>beams.</b> Thus, design is an element of the marketing program that Fläkt Woods need to improve. Furthermore, the study showed that relationships and communication which represent the “soft” elements concerning human interaction are just as important as the rest of the elements.

50|$|Due {{to their}} {{simplicity}} and flexibility, {{fan coil units}} can be more economical to install than ducted 100% fresh air systems (VAV) or central heating systems with air handling units or <b>chilled</b> <b>beams.</b> Various unit configurations are available, including horizontal (ceiling mounted) or vertical (floor mounted).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Chilled</b> <b>beam</b> {{systems are}} not a panacea. Additional {{ductwork}} {{may be needed to}} meet minimum outdoor air requirements. Both types of <b>chilled</b> <b>beam</b> systems are less effective at heating than cooling, and supplementary heating systems are often needed. <b>Chilled</b> <b>beam</b> systems cannot be used alone in buildings where the ceilings are higher than 2.7 m, because the air will not properly circulate. A forced-air circulation system must be employed in such cases. If the water temperature is too low or humidity is high, condensation on the beam can occur—leading to a problem known as [...] "internal rain." [...] (In some cases, drier outside air can be mixed with the wetter inside air to reduced interior humidity levels while maintaining system performance.) <b>Chilled</b> <b>beam</b> {{systems are not}} recommended for areas with high humidity (such as theaters, gymnasiums, or cafeterias). Because they are less effective at cooling, passive <b>chilled</b> <b>beam</b> systems are generally ill-suited for semi-tropical and tropical climates. Hospitals generally cannot use <b>chilled</b> <b>beam</b> systems because of restrictions on using recirculated air. <b>Chilled</b> <b>beam</b> systems are also known to cause noticeable air circulation which can make some people uncomfortable. (Passive air deflection devices can help disrupt these air patterns, alleviating the problem.) Some designers have found that enlarging the ducts around active <b>chilled</b> <b>beam</b> systems to increase air circulation causes echoes in working areas and amplifies the sound of water moving through the pipes to noticeable levels.|$|E
5000|$|The active <b>chilled</b> <b>beam</b> system employs fins to help {{heat and}} cool. Active <b>chilled</b> <b>beam</b> systems are {{effective}} {{to the point}} where outdoor air can be mixed with the indoor air without any traditional air conditioning (such as heating, cooling, humidifying, or dehumidifying), thus enabling a building to meet its [...] "minimum outdoor air" [...] air quality requirement.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of the <b>chilled</b> <b>beam</b> system is its lower operating cost. For example, because the temperature of cooled water {{is higher than the}} temperature of cooled air, but it delivers the same cooling ability, the costs of the cooled water system are lower. Because cooling and heating of air are no longer linked to the delivery of air, buildings also save money by being able to run fewer air circulation fans and at lower speeds. One estimate places the amount of air handled at 25 to 50 percent less using <b>chilled</b> <b>beam</b> systems. By being able to target the delivery of clean outdoor air where it is needed (rather than injecting it into the entire system and heating or cooling it), there is a reduced need to treat large amounts of outdoor air (also saving money). In one case, the Genomic Science Building at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill lowered its HVAC costs by 20 percent with an active <b>chilled</b> <b>beam</b> system. This is a typical energy cost savings. <b>Chilled</b> <b>beam</b> systems also have some advantages in that they are almost noiseless, require little maintenance, and are highly efficient. Traditional fan-driven HVAC systems create somewhat higher air velocities, which some people find uncomfortable. <b>Chilled</b> <b>beam</b> HVAC systems also require less ceiling space than forced-air HVAC systems, which can lead to lower building heights and higher ceilings. Since they do not require high forced air flows, <b>chilled</b> <b>beam</b> systems also require reduced air distribution duct networks (which also helps to lower cost).|$|E

Some designers have installed one <b>chilled</b> <b>beam</b> system around the building perimeter (where temperature differences can be the greatest) and another in the interior of the building, to better control temperature throughout the structure.

This study presents a simulation on evaluating various energy saving benefits of different DOAS configurations among diverse climate zones of commercial buildings in the United States. Three DOAS configurations in a medium office building are simulated in this study: (1) fan-coil units (FCUs) as terminal units with a DOAS unit supplying conditioned outdoor air (OA) to each FCU intake; (2) FCUs with a DOAS unit supplying conditioned OA directly to each occupied space; and (3) a DOAS with active <b>chilled</b> <b>beams.</b> A baseline system consisting of a conventional Variable Air Volume (VAV) system was also simulated for comparison to the three selected DOAS configurations. All simulation inputs are recommended by Department of Energy (DOE) benchmark reference models. Validations of the baseline system and three selected DOAS configurations are based on and compared to previous studies in literature. Building energy simulation results were collected for each system listed above. Additionally, two energy comparisons were performed: each DOAS configuration was compared with the baseline system, and a comparison of each DOAS configuration to the other DOAS configurations was made. Comparison of the simulation results indicates that DOAS energy savings ranged from 7. 1 % to 26 % between the seven simulated locations when compared to simulated baseline with some DOAS configurations performing better in particular climate. The major energy savings are accomplished due to DOAS requiring the exact amount of ventilation for each space and employing high efficiency local Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) units.
