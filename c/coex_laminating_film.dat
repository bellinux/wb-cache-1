40|$|The heat {{sealability}} of <b>laminated</b> <b>films</b> with linear {{low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) as the sealant materials was investigated. A laboratory heat sealer was used to study the response of <b>laminated</b> <b>films</b> to temperature, time, and pressure. Platen temperature was confirmed as primary factor in controlling heat-seal strength. Dwell time must be sufficiently long to bring the interfacial temperature to a desired level. When the desired heat-seal strength has been achieved, further increase of dwell time did not improved heat-seal strength. Platen pressure had little effect above the level required to flatten the materials for good contact. Bar sealing process window for each sample were developed. The optimum combination of platen temperature and dwell time for each <b>laminated</b> <b>film</b> can be obtained in the respective process windows. Strength of heat-seal and its failure modes are closely related. Plateau initiation temperature closely corresponds to the final melting point of sealant materials. Relatively higher platen temperature was required to seal <b>laminated</b> <b>films</b> with lower thermal conductance.

The currently used mould cleaning process is sand blasting (abrasive process) and dry rubber mould cleaning compounds (depends on the skill of the operators during rubber compounding). Latex laminated compounds will be beneficial as a new substitute for mould cleaning because of its excellent strength properties and the lamination process to increase its thickness.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} thermal conductivity of graphene <b>laminate</b> <b>films</b> deposited on polyethylene terephthalate substrates. Two types of graphene laminate were studied - as deposited and compressed - {{in order to}} determine the physical parameters affecting the heat conduction the most. The measurements were performed using the optothermal Raman technique and a set of suspended samples with the graphene laminate thickness from 9 to 44 micrometers. The thermal conductivity of graphene laminate was found to be in the range from 40 W/mK to 90 W/mK at room temperature. It was found unexpectedly that the average size and the alignment of graphene flakes are more important parameters defining the heat conduction than the mass density of the graphene laminate. The thermal conductivity scales up linearly with the average graphene flake size in both uncompressed and compressed laminates.
