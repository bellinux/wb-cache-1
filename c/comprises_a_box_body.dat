25|$|The 60 pounder {{was a heavy}} field gun or ‘gun of position’ {{designed}} to be towed by either a horse team or mechanical vehicle. It had a quick firing recoil, meaning that the carriage did not move when the gun fired. The barrel was a wire wound A tube in a jacket with a screw breech.

40|$|A Frenchman on Chicago’s Southside, a {{white man}} in the ghetto, he stumbles into the Woodlawn Boys Club, <b>a</b> <b>boxing</b> gym. He spends {{three and a half}} years there (1988 – 91). He becomes an {{accomplished}} boxer, fights and loses his bout in the Chicago amateur Golden Gloves competition. His goals were three: 1) Could he exist in this world, and could he learn how to be boxer? 2) Could he read race in the ghetto through his experiences in the Woodlawn gym? 3) Could he write a carnal sociology, a sociology of lived experience. The project is inspired by Bourdieu, who argued that the social order inscribes itself in our bodies.

50|$|The {{bridge is}} 315.3 m long, {{measured}} between the abutments, <b>comprising</b> <b>a</b> steel arch supporting a reinforced concrete deck executed {{as a continuous}} girder across 17 spans: 17.52 m + 2 x 19.71 m + 19.68 m + 7 x 17.52 m + 19.68 m + 4 x 19.71 m + 17.52 m. The deck structure <b>comprises</b> <b>a</b> grillage consisting of the deck slab with longitudinal girders and cross-girders. The 0.25 m thick reinforced concrete deck slab {{is supported by the}} cross-girders set 2.19 m apart and the longitudinal girders set 8 m apart and made composite. The bridge piers and spandrel columns comprise hollow square cross-section. Size of the squares (edge) varies depending on height of the piers and columns from 650 mm to 850 mm, except for the columns at the springing which are 2300 mm wide. The arch spans 155 m, with an arch rise of 41.45 m. The arch <b>comprises</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> cross section and provides a 55 m clearance below the bridge.|$|R

50|$|At this {{location}} the motorway route follows a horizontal curve with a radius of 2505.1 m. The {{deck of the}} viaduct follows a 26500 m radius concave vertical curve, and the longitudinal grade of the road carried by the viaduct ranges from 4.38% to 0.78%. The viaduct is <b>a</b> <b>box</b> girder structure supporting the deck across nineteen spans: two of 40 m, sixteen of 50 m and one of 40 m. The viaduct piers range from 18.72 m to 53.04 m in height. The superstructure of the viaduct <b>comprises</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> cross section made from pre-stressed reinforced concrete, put in place by incremental launching due to the considerable height of the structure. The launching was carried out downhill, because of the substantial grade of the superstructure, with two VBT 19×140 cable stays as a braking mechanism for the 20000 t box girder. The cross-sections of the box girder and the piers are virtually identical to those of Bajer Bridge.|$|R
5000|$|In {{some parts}} of rural Sweden, {{especially}} the sparsely populated northern inland, mail is delivered by bus. Formerly this service was handled by the postal service themselves in their own buses and livery. As Postens Diligenstrafik (lit. the Post's stagecoach traffic) between the years 1923 - 1991. In 1991 this {{became a part of}} the Swebus company. Nowadays it is handled by the local councils own public transportation buses by appointment of the postal service. Due to deregulations since the early 1990s some lines are run as public service obligations by private contractors. In addition to that there is an association of local bus companies called Bussgods which works as a courier for bulkier goods between bus stops and/or terminals. Unlike the British postbuses these vehicles are built on full-size coaches chassis with <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>body</b> and <b>a</b> tail lift in the rear end to accommodate heavier goods and even pallets sent along with the mail.

5000|$|When the Raleigh Bicycle Company {{decided to}} {{discontinue}} {{the manufacture of}} their three-wheeled vehicles in 1934, their Works Manager Mr T. L. Williams and a colleague, Mr E. S. Thompson, felt that the days of lightweight three-wheelers were not over. They decided {{to build their own}} vehicle in Williams's back garden at Kettlebrook, Tamworth. The homebuilt design closely resembled the Karryall van previously built by Raleigh, and the prototype was licensed in January 1935. It was a 7 cwt (356 kg) van with a steel chassis, powered by a 600 cc single-cylinder engine driving the rear wheels through a 3-speed gearbox and chain drive. The body was a hardwood frame with aluminium panels attached to it, in the traditional manner of the time. With the obvious motorcycle front end, mounted in the open, in front of the bulkhead, it was essentially a motorcycle fitted with <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>body.</b> Indeed, the initial prototype had handlebars for steering [...] although after several trials with small local companies this was changed for a steering wheel.|$|R

A small tipper body with screw type gear was also listed, as was a standard dropside truck. Several styles of van body were offered, such as <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>body</b> of , <b>a</b> van body of , a pantechnicon with integral cab offering [...] capacity or with a factory cab [...] A milk float was also listed, as was a body style called a canopy pickup. This was a conversion of the standard panel van, but with the roof and sides down to the waist rail removed from a point about halfway along to the rear. The rear doors were also removed and a drop tailboard substituted, while a partition was put {{at the back of}} the cab area and a tip up seat built on to this bulkhead.The Eagle Engineering Company of Warwick produced small tower wagon equipment for the 400E, and Tuke and Bell supplied a special little slide cover refuse truck just the job for narrow alleys or pedestrian precincts.|$|R
