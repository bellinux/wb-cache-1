40|$|The {{toxicity}} of Diazinon, <b>Chlorthion</b> and Sumicide are studied {{in comparison with}} parathion The approximate LD(50) for rabbit are (mg per kg of weight) By the application of these compound, the changes are as follows; 1) Blood cholinesterase of rabbit, both serum and blood corpuscle, are similarly inhibited as the case of Parathion. 2) Symptom of poisoning with rabbit {{is the same as}} Parathion. 3) By the rabbit, there occur leucocytosis, mainly due to pseudoeosinophils, and the Arneth count is deflected to the left. Lymphocyte shows relative decrease. 4) Frog heart is examined by Staub-Fuhner method. Heart block that can be made by over 10 (- 8) concentration of Parathion, also occurs by 10 (- 7) Diazinon and 10 (- 6) <b>Chlorthion.</b> 5) The blood vessels of rabbit ear are dilated by the application of 0. 1 mg Diazinon. 6) Diazinon and <b>Chlorthion</b> make the lowering of arterial blood pressure in the experiment with dog. 7) By the subcutaneous application of these compound the rabbit serum protein and albumin increase, and gamma-globulin decreases...|$|E
40|$|In {{the study}} of the action of alkylphosphates on the blood {{pressure}} in dog and on the peripheral blood vessels (Krawkow-Pissemiskii's method) in rabbit ear the author obtained the following: 1. At the time when Parathion is administered by intraveneous injection the blood pressure presents a rise in two stages. 2. This rise in blood pressure is thought to originate from the central nervous system or from the adrenal glands. 3. As for such changes in blood pressure, its rise in the initial stage can not be stopped by atropine administration: but after the initial stage it is inhibited by atropine while it is promoted by epinephrine. 4. The administration of Diazinon or <b>Chlorthion</b> brings about a fall in the blood pressure from the initial stage. 5. Parathion, Diazinon, and <b>Chlorthion</b> all bring about a transitory dilatation of the extirpated peripheral blood vessels. 6. For the dilatation of peripheral blood vessels atropine and Finalin act well antagonistically while acetylcholine acts as an invigorator...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{studies were}} made on {{resistance}} of the larvae of Anchylostoma caninum against alkylphosphate insecticides, Parathion, Diazinon, <b>Chlorthion</b> and ACC 4124 (Sumicide). The results were as follows. 1) In the emulsions of Parathion, Diazinon, <b>Chlorthion</b> and sumicide, having the concentration over 10 - 5 %, 10 - 3 %, 10 - 3 % and 10 - 2 % respectively, most of the larvae died within four days. This indicated that these alkylphosphates were in some degree possible to prevent hookworm diseases due to the toxity to the larvae, when sprayed in the field. 2) Hookworm larvae in contact with alkylphsphates, nerve toxin, were lead to death after showing abnormal movement. The stages to death may be divided into stage of incubation, convulsion, ataxia, palsy and death. 3) Microscopically the bodies of dead larvae were observed to be of minute or moderate granular degeneration, and consequently internal components were not discernible. 4) In the alkylphosphate emulsions, the larvae moulted quite rapidly. 5) With the lapse of time both lethality {{and the rate of}} ecdysis increased in parallel correlation, while the count of the head movement of larvae per minute was in inverse proportion to them...|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of emulsified methylparathion, diazinon, <b>chlorthion</b> and sumicide examined {{in comparison with}} that of ethylparathion in laboratory rabbit. The results were as follows. 1) All these compounds were absorbed by means of dermal, oral, subcutaneous snd intravenous application. Methylparathion was 1 / 21 / 4, <b>chlorthion</b> was 1 / 31 / 8 and sumicide was 1 / 25 as toxic as ethylparathion, but diazinon was toxic as much the same. 2) These compounds produced a marked depression of cholinesterase (ChE) activities of both serum and red blood cell in all subjects examined. The ChE inactivation caused by methylparathion and sumicide slower {{than that of the}} others. 3) The main symptoms caused by exposure to these compounds were alike to those produced by ethylparathion. 4) With the application of these compouuds, the changes of hemoglobin and red blood cell count were not remarkable, except in the sumicide case which the decrease of both occured 2 to 3 days after the administration. There occured, as the case of ethylparathion, leucocytosis, mainly occupied by pseudoeosinophils with the deflection of Arneth count to the left as well as relative lymphocytopenia...|$|E
40|$|By {{studying}} {{the action of}} alkylposphates on the isolated frog heart (the Straub-Fuhner method) and on the frog heart in vivo (Engelmann's method), the author obtained the following results: 1. The auriculo-ventricular block occurs whan exposed to Parathion at a low concentration. 2. In the case of Parathion at a higher concentration there occurs {{a decrease in the}} amplitude of heart-beat, and further on brings about the diastolic cessation. 3. Such changes as mentioned above do not return to normal unless properly treated. 4. Atropine and interceptors of the autonomic nerves can well act antagonistically to the action of Parathion. 5. Epinephrine acts antagonistically against Parathion. 6. Acetylcholine and ergotamine act as to invigorate the action of Parathion. 7. Diazinon and <b>Chlorthion</b> act more or less {{in the same manner as}} Parathion...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} {{experiments}} the author studied {{the influences of}} four alkylphosphates such as parathion, diazinon, <b>chlorthion</b> and sumicide on serum protein, hematcrit value and hemoglobin content in blood of rabits and obtained the following: 1. Changes occurring when exposed to these alkylphosphates are common; namly, an increase in serum total protein, hematcrit value and hemoglobin content in blood {{as well as an}} increase in the A/G ratio, and a decrease in Î³-globulin. 2. These changes reach the maximum at the peak of symptoms, namly, at the stage where serum cholinesterase is at the lowest level. Consequently changes occur differently according to the method of administration, for instance, the method in which the appearance of symptoms is delayed like percutaneous administration makes changes appear slower than in the case of subcutaneous injcction. Slow working surnicide also brings about the changes more slowly than other drugs. 3. These changes are assumed to be induced by the stimulation of the parasympathetic nerves by alkylphosphates...|$|E
