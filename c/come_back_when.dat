5|$|The First World War {{interrupted}} his studies. A {{week after}} winning the OHA championship in March 1915, Smythe and his eight teammates enlisted. Smythe recalled in his memoirs that he and several classmates tried to enlist {{at the beginning of}} the 1914–15 season, but were told to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>when</b> they had beards. After securing a provisional rank of lieutenant with the 2nd (Ottawa) Battery, 8th Brigade, on July 17, he headed to the Royal School of Artillery in Kingston, Ontario, in August for five weeks of training. He made full lieutenant on September 11, and was able to get himself transferred to the 40th (Sportsmen's) Battery of Hamilton, organized by publishing figure Gordon Southam, son of William Southam. The unit, with Smythe as team manager, organized a team to compete in the OHA's senior league; they were one of four Toronto-based teams in the league in 1916. He played one game at centre, and then decided to replace himself with a better player. The team did not complete the season, as the 40th Battery went overseas in February 1916.|$|E

In 2003, 3,000 of the best jobs in town disappeared when Agere Systems closed the Reading Works. But the jobs won't <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>when</b> the economy does; like many other high-tech companies, Agere Systems moved production overseas.|$|E
25|$|According to his great-great-grandson, d'Alembert {{received}} him rather poorly, {{and to get}} rid of him {{gave him}} a thick mathematics book, saying to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>when</b> he had read it. When Laplace came back a few days later, d'Alembert was even less friendly and did not hide his opinion that it was impossible that Laplace could have read and understood the book. But upon questioning him, he realised that it was true, and from that time he took Laplace under his care.|$|E

25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Green Bay {{got a chance}} to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>when</b> safety Terrell Buckley intercepted a pass from Aikman on the Packers 40-yard line. Green Bay then drove to the Cowboys 37, but on fourth down and 8, Favre's pass to tight end Ed West netted just six yards. Dallas took the ball back and stormed 65 yards in six plays, {{including}} an 18-yard catch by Irvin with a 15-yard face-mask penalty turning it into a 33-yard gain. On the last play, Irvin caught a 19-yard touchdown reception. Now down by 21 points, Green Bay countered with a 9-play, 82-yard drive, with Favre completing four consecutive passes, including a 30-yard gain to running back Darrell Thompson, and scoring on a 13-yard pass to Robert Brooks, cutting their deficit to 24–10 going into the fourth quarter.|$|E
25|$|Tennessee's {{inability}} {{to get into the}} end zone came to an end on just the third play of the third quarter, when George took a handoff from McNair and stormed through {{the middle of the field}} for a 68-yard touchdown run. Then after several punts, the Titans put together a 13-play, 73-yard drive, featuring a 26-yard completion from McNair to receiver Chris Sanders. With 12:57 left in the fourth quarter, Del Greco finished the drive with his third field goal, increasing the Tennessee lead to 16–9. Later in the quarter, the Colts had a great opportunity to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>when</b> wide receiver Terrence Wilkins returned a punt 87 yards to the Titans 3-yard line, but it was overruled by a replay challenge from coach Jeff Fisher. Fisher had to burn a timeout to get his challenge heard over the roaring crowd in the RCA Dome, but it paid off, as the replay showed Wilkins had stepped out of bounds at his own 33-yard line during the return.|$|E

2500|$|JR and Babe (now {{portrayed by}} Baker) become closer and reunite romantically. JR teams {{up with his}} father, Adam, just like old times. Their goal is to take down Fusion Cosmetics.

Fusion Cosmetics is at a height of excellence and things are working wonderfully. Babe and JR decide to use [...] "Bella" [...] (a new perfume designed by Babe) to launch her career. They begin to plan their next wedding and decide {{to have a second}} child. Adam has a plan of his own with the assistance of Pete Cortlandt (Daniel Kennedy), who taints the Bella perfume at the launch party. Colby (Brianne Moncrief), JR's sister, gets sick, but no one notices that it is due to the perfume. Greenlee later gets sick, but calls it the flu. When a wedding party arrives at P.V. Hospital, Angie Hubbard says that it is a toxin in Bella that is causing the sickness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) then shuts Fusion Cosmetics temporarily down. While Adam is encouraging lawsuits against Fusion, Babe resigns and tells the company to blame the Bella scandal on her. She also admits that she and JR were planning to take over. She has an ulterior motive, as her and JR are planning to move to San Diego anyway. However, they have to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>when</b> Adam has them subpoenaed to the Bella trial. JR and Babe do not make it to the trial, as they are caught up in a series of tornadoes that strike Pine Valley. Babe sacrifices herself to keep Little Adam from dying, making her internal and external bleeding worse. While in the hospital, she asks JR to marry her. They cannot find a minister as Babe is running out of time before she loses her life, but they exchange vows, regardless, alone in the hospital's chapel. They kiss, declare that they made each other better people and that they love each other from the deepest part of their souls; that their love will never stop, no matter what. After a light hug, Babe dies in JR's arms.|$|E
