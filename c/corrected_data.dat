It is located in Red Paint Canyon where there are exposures of red earth which the Warms Springs Apaches used as a face paint, and which gave them the name of Chinenne, or the Red Paint People. Apache Warm Springs is the site of a beryllium deposit, and a controversy occurred from 2009 to 2012 when BE Resources, Inc. sought and received a permit to conduct core drilling at the site. The concern was from Apache groups over the anticipated damage to the Ojo Caliente spring, a sacred site, and from local residents concerned to the potential disruption of the flow other springs in the area that provided irrigation water along Alamosa Creek. However, after drilling in 2011 the <b>corrected</b> <b>data</b> indicated that the deposits of beryllium and other rare earth minerals were not present in payable quantities, and BE Resources, Inc. decided to cease exploration work at the site, and focus elsewhere on other mining options, leaving the Red Pain Canyon area relatively unchanged.|$|E

In current approaches it exploits pure data replication to assure data availability. In this paper, we consider the use of codes and data dispersal in combination to in-network storage. In particular, given an abstract model of in-network storage we show how codes can be employed, and we discuss how this can be achieved in three cases of study. Since the configuration of the network is particularly critical with respect to <b>correct</b> <b>data</b> encoding, we define framework aimed at evaluating the probability of <b>correct</b> <b>data</b> encoding and decoding. Then we exploit this result and simulations to show how, in the cases of study, the parameters of the codes and the network should be configured in order to achieve <b>correct</b> <b>data</b> coding and decoding with high probability. ...|$|R

[...] As Gross notes, this sets the American professoriate apart from the American public, approximately 17% of whom are leftist or liberal. While suggesting that it was hopeless to deny that professors were, as a whole, a [...] "liberal lot," [...] however, Gross criticized conservative writers and researchers' tendency to exaggerate liberal bias, criticizing research such as Rothman, Licther, and Nevitte's as using [...] "questionable methodologies," [...] and [...] "as much advocacy as scholarship." [...] According to Gross, it is important to recognize that the academics classified as liberal in surveys hold a wide range of views, that their ranks include many independents and moderates, and that truly radical professors make up less than eight percent of the professoriate.|$|E
5000|$|A 2007 {{article by}} a team of University of Colorado archaeoastronomers and archaeologists (three members had been {{involved}} in the original discovery of the site and its astronomical alignment) has responded to the work of Brophy and Rosen, in particular their claims for an alignment with Sirius in 6088 and other alignments which they dated to 6270, saying that these dates were about 1500 years earlier than the estimated dates. The Sirius alignment in question was originally proposed by Wendorf and Malville, {{for one of the most}} prominent alignments of megaliths labelled the [...] "C-line", which they said aligned to the rising of Sirius circa 4820 BC. Brophy and Rosen showed in 2005 that megalith orientations and star positions reported by Wendorf and Malville were in error, noting that [...] "Given these <b>corrected</b> <b>data,</b> we see that Sirius actually aligned with the C line circa 6000 BC. We estimate that 6088 BC Sirius had a declination of -36.51 deg, for a rising azimuth exactly on the C-line average".

A new type of banding was discovered which is related to the bi-directional scanning of TM. An initial empirical model was developed for correcting this effect in band 1, but should receive additional development. The scan angle effects observed corresponded to those expected based on atmospheric considerations and scene characteristics. Low frequency scan-to-scan noise was detected in band 1, band 7, {{and to a lesser extent}} in bands 2 and 3.
