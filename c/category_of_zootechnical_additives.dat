The most important expected benefits of probiotic LAB are growth-promoting effects through better feed utilization and digestion, and biological control of pathogen colonization. They are also used to enhance milk and egg production. According to their functions and properties, additives for animal feed are classified in one or several categories including technological, sensorial, nutritional, or <b>zootechnical</b> <b>additives.</b> In Europe, the authorization of microorganisms used as <b>zootechnical</b> <b>additives</b> for feed is subjected to strict regulation. The chapter addresses the main animal production sectors, their specificities {{in terms of the}} production types (meat, milk, egg), the ecosystems to be considered (gut, vaginal, and/or mammary) and presence of LAB therein, the main diseases encountered, and the use of probiotics to prevent these diseases or enhance productivity...|$|R

40|$|International audienceInvestigations were {{undertaken}} to identify causes for {{the occurrence of}} high levels <b>of</b> the <b>zootechnical</b> feed <b>additive</b> nicarbazin in broiler liver at slaughter. The first investigation on 32 commercial broiler flocks involved sampling and analysis for nicarbazin (as dinitrocarbanilide, DNC) in liver from birds during a 3 - 10 day period after withdrawal of nicarbazin from their feed and prior to commercial slaughter. DNC residues in liver samples of broilers scheduled as being withdrawn from nicarbazin for ≥ 6 days ranged from 20 to > 1600 μg/kg (the specified withdrawal period for nicarbazin is 5 days and the JECFA MRL is 200 μg/kg liver). Further on-farm investigations on 12 of these flocks, {{selected on the basis}} of the feeding system in use and the levels of DNC residues determined in liver, identified issues in feed management contributing to elevated residues in broiler liver. A significant correlation (0. 81, p < 0. 01, n = 10) between DNC residues in liver samples and in feed samples from the feeding pans was observed. The second investigation on 12 commercial broiler flocks involved sampling and analysis for DNC in liver samples and feed samples from feeding pans and from the feed mill at the three thinnings of birds for commercial slaughter. In the case of one flock, a clear relationship between nicarbazin in feed from the feed mill (10. 5 mg/kg DNC), in feed from the feeding pans (6. 6 mg/kg DNC) and in liver (583 μg/kg DNC) at first thinning (9 days scheduled withdrawal from nicarbazin) was observed. Such a clear relationship was not observed in other cases, particularly at second and third thinnings, pointing to re-exposure of birds to nicarbazin late in the flock production cycle, probably from the litter. Guidelines outlining best farm practice to eliminate nicarbazin residues in poultry have been published in booklet and poster format for broiler producers and deal with feed system cleaning, feed bin management, feed deliveries, feed usage and records...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor many years, {{microbial}} adjuncts {{have been}} used to supplement the diets of farm animals and humans. They have evolved since the 1990 s to become known as probiotics, i. e. functional food with health benefits. After the discovery of a possible link between manipulation of gut microflora in mice and obesity, a focus on the use of these beneficial microbes that act on gut microflora in animal farming was undertaken and compared with the use of probiotics for food. Beneficial microbes added to feed are classified at a regulatory level as <b>zootechnical</b> <b>additives,</b> in the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> gut flora stabilizers for healthy animals and are regulated up to strain level in Europe. Intended effects are improvement of performance characteristics, which are strain dependent and growth enhancement is not a prerequisite. In fact, increase of body weight is not commonly reported and its frequency is around 25 % of the published data examined here. However, when a Body Weight Gain (BWG) was found in the literature, it was generally moderate (lower than or close to 10 %) and this over a reduced period of their short industrial life. When it was higher than 10 %, it could be explained as an indirect consequence of the alleviation of the weight losses linked to stressful intensive rearing conditions or health deficiency. However, regulations on feed do not consider the health effects because animals are supposed to be healthy, so there is no requirement for reporting healthy effects in the standard European dossier. The regulations governing the addition of beneficial microorganisms to food are less stringent than for feed and no dossier is required if a species has a Qualified Presumption of Safety status. The microbial strain marketed is not submitted to any regulation and its properties (including BWG) {{do not need to be}} studied. Only claims for functional or healthy properties are regulated and again growth effect is not included. However, recent studies on probiotic effects showed that BWG could also be observed in humans, or not, according to species and strains. Determining the significance of farm animal results for extrapolation to humans, especially regarding body weight improvement, was not easy because they do not use the same microbial strains nor always the same species. Furthermore, the framework for the management of microbials added to feed or to food differ, especially with regard to goal, timescale and lifestyle. So no one can exclude the possibility that beneficial microorganisms having probiotic effects may have long-term effects in humans that cannot be seen to date in animals, where short-term use is the rule. A possible link to obesity cannot be excluded in relation to timescale, species and strain specificity. To conclude, beneficial microorganisms added in feed are key factors stringently regulated for short-term improvement <b>of</b> <b>zootechnical</b> performances in animals and their use does not entirely parallel that of human probiotics. So extrapolation of farm animal results to humans is biased and not sufficient to be conclusive regarding the existence or not of a link between probiotics and obesity. From a toxicological and nutritional point of view and considering recent findings on a link between antibiotic use in early life and excessive risk of becoming overweight, one suggestion is to study the at-risk population in Europe, pregnant women and their babies before and after birth and during early childhood, in an epidemiological long-term cohort survey...|$|R

Levucell SC 20 /Levucell SC 10 ME is a preparation of dried cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CNCM I- 1077). It is intended for use as a <b>zootechnical</b> <b>additive</b> in feed for leisure horses at a dose of 3 x 109 CFU kg- 1 of complete feedingstuffs. In its previous opinion on Levucell SC 20 /Levucell SC 10 ME for leisure horses, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was not able to conclude on the efficacy of the preparation because of insufficient evidence provided by the company. The applicant has now provided an additional study aiming to demonstrate that the effect of Levucell SC 20 for leisure horses corresponds to that for other ruminants, e. g. increase of fibre digestibility. Thus, the current opinion focuses on the assessment of that new study. Evidence that Levucell SC 20 is able to produce a significant improvement on fibre digestion was shown in one experiment in adult horses. This effect was consistent with the microbiological analyses of faecal samples, which showed a significant increase in gut cellulolytic bacteria associated with Levucell SC 20 supplementation...|$|R

The problems <b>of</b> <b>zootechnical</b> sustainability appear to be of a very complex nature. Today, the main approach used to study {{the complexity of the}} phenomenon is the use of simulation models. In this thesis the application of simulation models is supported by the integration of informatics systems GIS. This thesis propose two studies. The first is the implementation of GIS with the EISR mathematical model for the planning and management of the stocking rate for all the Sardinian region territory, with detail of 1 : 50. 000, in order to evaluate areas of Sardinia that are at risk of desertification following the activities of animal breeding. The amendments to this process for the decade 1995 - 2005, have also been assessed. The second regards the use of GIS for the management of marginal pasture areas of the Goceano region (SS). Thirteen farms were studied and we used their econimical and managing data as input of our matematical models. Through this mathematical models we calculated: stocking rates (ABU ha/year), nitrogen excretions, and net profit/ABU.

This product is authorised for use in chickens for fattening as a <b>zootechnical</b> <b>additive,</b> functional group <b>of</b> digestibility enhancers. The applicant seeks for {{the extension of the}} use of the additive to chickens reared for laying and to minor poultry species for fattening at a dose range of 50 to 100 alpha-galactosidase units and of 285 to 570 glucanase units per kg feed (corresponding to 50 to 100 mg additive/kg feed). In a previous evaluation the additive was shown to be safe in chickens for fattening at a dose of 100 galactosidase and 570 glucanase units per kg feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that this conclusion can be extended to chickens reared for laying. Given the margin of safety established for the major species, these conclusions can be extrapolated to minor poultry species for fattening. The potential of the product to be efficacious when used in chickens for fattening was previously established at the dose of  50 U galactosidase and 285 U glucanase per kg feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that this conclusion applies to chickens reared for laying.

The FEEDAP Panel considers that, since the additive has been demonstrated to be safe for piglets at the recommended dose, this conclusion can be extended to pigs for fattening and extrapolated to minor growing porcine species. Supplementation of diets for pigs for fattening with Avemix® XG 10 at the recommended dose (4 000 XU and 900 BGU/kg) resulted in a significantly higher body weight and daily weight gain in one trial and significantly improved feed to gain ratio in two trials. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that AveMix® XG 10 {{has the potential to be}} efficacious in pigs for fattening at this dose. Since the mode of action of xylanases and glucanases can reasonably be assumed to be the same in all porcine species, the conclusions on efficacy for weaned piglets and pigs for fattening can be extrapolated to include all minor porcine species for growing at 4 000 XU and 900 BGU/kg complete feed...|$|R

In 2007 the European Food Safety Authority was requested {{to evaluate the}} safety and efficacy of the additive when used as a <b>zootechnical</b> <b>additive</b> (functional group: gut flora stabilisers) in diets for chickens for fattening, piglets and pigs for fattening. At that time the FEEDAP Panel was able to conclude only on the safety for the environment. EFSA is now requested to assess the safety for the target animals and consumers, and {{the efficacy of the}} additive when added in diets for chickens for fattening at 5 x 108 - 9 x 109 CFU/kg feed and for piglets at 9 x 108 - 1 x 1010 CFU/kg feed. The identity of the six strains was established. As no antibiotic resistance of concern was detected and as five of the strains qualify for the Qualified Presumption of Safety approach to safety assessment, their use is presumed safe for target species and consumers. The Enterococcus faecium strain is not a recognised pathogen for animals and as the additive did not adversely affect growth of chickens or piglets, Probiotic LACTINA® is considered safe for the target species up to 1 x 1010 CFU/kg feed. The E. faecium strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections. The metabolic pathways of E. faecium are well known. Since no other harmful metabolites are expected and the additive does not contain excipients of concern, it is considered safe for consumers. Probiotic LACTINA® showed a potential to increase the body weight of suckling piglets when used at approximately 5 x 109 CFU/kg feed.
