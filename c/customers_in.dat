40|$|Motivated by service {{levels in}} terms of the waiting time {{distribution}} seen in e. g. call centers, we consider two models for systems with a service disciple that depends on the waiting time. The first model deals with a single server that continuously adapts its service rate based on the waiting time of the first <b>customer</b> <b>in</b> line. In the second model, one queue is served by a primary server which is supplemented by a secondary server when the waiting of the first <b>customer</b> <b>in</b> line exceeds a threshold. Using level crossings for the waiting time process of the first <b>customer</b> <b>in</b> line, we derive steady-state waiting time distributions for both models. The results are illustrated with numerical examples...|$|R
