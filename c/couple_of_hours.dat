Those {{separated}} for Ayaş were transported in carts for a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> further to Ayaş. Almost all of them were killed several months later in gorges near Ankara. Only 10 (or 13) deportees of this group were granted permission to return to Constantinople from Ayaş. A group of 20 latecomers arrested on 24 April arrived in Çankırı around 7 or 8 May 1915. Roughly 150 political prisoners were detained in Ayaş, and another 150 intellectual prisoners were detained in Çankırı.|$|E

5000|$|The {{brand of}} herb tea in china called “Wong Lo Kat Herbal Tea” {{launched}} by Wang Zebang from Heshan in 1828. In the very beginning, the Chinese herb tea can only {{provided by the}} shop on the street. It is used to be prepared, when someone orders, the Chinese herb tea will serve in a traditional bowl, and the customers will need to finish it before leaving. When Chinese herbal tea becomes more popular, the demand is way higher than the supply [...]It is because producing a Chinese herbal tea needs <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours.</b> Obviously, it cannot fulfill the demand of the market immediately. This way of producing Chinese herbal tea needs a change, in an advance way. After that, Wang Zebang has a new idea to sell Chinese herbal tea. He decided to design packets of herbal tea bag. Customers can buy the herbal tea bag and boil it by themselves. This is the initial stage industrialization of Chinese herbal tea.|$|R

5|$|Unlike humans, horses do {{not sleep}} in a solid, {{unbroken}} period of time, but take many short periods of rest. Horses spend four to fifteen {{hours a day in}} standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. Total sleep time in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes to a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours,</b> mostly in short intervals of about 15minutes each. The average sleep time of a domestic horse is said to be 2.9 hours per day.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as medication given a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, {{which can be}} useful, as patients may not remember unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia {{as well as some}} ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious. Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time, as well as its water solubility, which reduces pain upon injection. Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 26 September 2016, Pascu's wife called the {{emergency}} number (112) twice. The first time the artist complained about a panic attack and a 3 days lasting insomnia. The ambulance doctor reported that the patient didn't mention previous illness history (namely his previous stroke), he only mentioned his diabetes and his knee pain that prevented him from sleep. Pascu refused hospitalization. His only request was to be administrated something {{in order to get}} some sleep, and the doctor gave him Diazepam. A second call followed a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> later; this time Pascu was unconscious. Doctors tried to resuscitate, but to no avail. It was determined that Pascu died due to a heart attack.|$|E

She was whirled onward through the next <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> critical <b>hours</b> by the mastering tide of her devotion to him, which closed up further meditation. Her one desire, so long resisted, to make herself his, to call him her lord, her own--then, if necessary, to die--had at last lifted her up from her plodding reflective pathway. In dressing, she moved about in a mental cloud of many-coloured idealities, which eclipsed all sinister contingencies by its brightness.|$|R
60|$|Starting at six {{the next}} morning, {{we had three}} <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> {{the same kind of}} walking, during which we crossed the river at least thirty or forty times, the water being {{generally}} knee-deep. This brought us to a place where the road left the stream, and here we stopped to breakfast. We then had a long walk over the mountain, by a tolerable path, which reached an elevation of about fifteen hundred feet above the sea. Here I noticed one of the smallest and most elegant tree ferns I had ever seen, the stem being scarcely thicker than my thumb, yet reaching a height of fifteen or twenty feet. I also caught a new butterfly of the genus Pieris, and a magnificent female specimen of Papilio gambrisius, of which I had hitherto only found the males, which are smaller and very different in colour. Descending {{the other side of the}} ridge, by a very steep path, we reached another river at a spot which is about the centre of the island, and which was to be our resting place for two or three days. In a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hour</b> my men had built a little sleeping-shed for me, about eight feet by four, with a bench of split poles, they themselves occupying two or three smaller ones, which had been put up by former passengers.|$|R
5|$|For {{six days}} prior to the {{beginning}} of the American offensive, Allied heavy artillery targeted German defenses around Aachen. Although the heavy bombardment forced the German LXXXI Corps to halt all daylight personnel and supply movements, it had little effect on the pillboxes and strongpoints. The opening aerial bombardment on 2 October also caused little damage to German defensive positions; the 450 aircraft which took part in the first wave failed to register a single direct hit on any German pillbox. Their targets had been largely obscured by thick smoke from the Allied artillery barrage. As the aircraft finished their assault, the artillery resumed bombarding the front lines, firing 18,696 shells from 372 gun tubes within a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E
5|$|Merrick {{settled into}} {{his new life}} at the London Hospital. Treves visited him daily and spent a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> with him every Sunday. Now that Merrick had found someone who {{understood}} his speech, he was delighted to carry on long conversations with the doctor. Treves and Merrick built a friendly relationship, although Merrick never completely confided in him. He told Treves {{that he was an}} only child, and Treves had the impression that Merrick's mother, whose picture Merrick always carried with him, had abandoned him as a baby. Merrick was also reluctant to talk about his exhibition days, although he expressed gratitude towards his former managers. It did not take Treves long to realise that, contrary to his initial impressions, Merrick was not intellectually impaired.|$|E

30|$|Note, however, {{that the}} {{construction}} of the RB approximation spaces (subsequent to port space construction) is embarrassingly parallel. Also note that we do not consider parameters for spatial orientation (because of the mapping Jacobian cancellations in the archetype domain formulation), and furthermore recall that components often have “free” parameters such as component-wide thermal conductivity or Young’s modulus, with which the solutions to (18) and (19) simply scale linearly. As a result, RB space dimensions are typically rather small (around ten basis functions often suffice for each RB space), and thus although this step typically dominates offline cost the computational effort is not onerous: typically a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> CPU <b>hours</b> is required for each archetype component.|$|R
5|$|The {{pressure}} from the ice caused Endurance to start to take on water. To prevent the ship from flooding McNish built a cofferdam, caulking it with strips of blankets and nailing strips over the seams, standing for hours up to his waist in freezing water as he worked. He could not prevent the {{pressure from}} the ice crushing the ship though and was experienced enough {{to know when to}} stop trying. Once the ship had been destroyed he was put in charge of rescuing the stores from what had been The Ritz. With McNish in charge it took only a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> to open the deck far enough to retrieve a good quantity of provisions.|$|E
5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the march, Julian gave {{a speech}} to the {{assembled}} army. Its wording could be read as implying that Julian had already had a fortified marching-camp built (in accordance with standard Roman military practice), or that he was simply proposing to do so. In any case, it appears that Julian, concerned that his men might be too tired to fight after a 6-hour march in the hot sun, urged that the clash be postponed until the following day. But his officers and men {{would have none of it}} and clamoured to be led against the enemy immediately. Julian, who prided himself on acting by consensus, gave way. However, since Ammianus states that the battle and subsequent pursuit ended after sunset, it seems unlikely that the army would have actually engaged at midday straight after the march without a few hours rest and refreshment (and, if a camp was built, a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> spent on that task). It thus seems more likely that battle commenced in the late afternoon.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{advantage}} {{is the ability}} for it to quickly reach full power. Unlike other baseload power plants that may have a minimum time of being online once started. This [...] "minimum up" [...] is a common term in the power industry when referring to this requirement. Therefore, SCCTs are usually used as peaking power plants, which can operate from several hours per day to a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> dozen <b>hours</b> per year, depending on the electricity demand and the generating capacity of the region. In areas with a shortage of base load and load following power plant capacity, a gas turbine power plant may regularly operate during most <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the day and even into the evening. A typical large simple-cycle gas turbine may produce 100 to 300 megawatts of power and have 35-40% thermal efficiency. The most efficient turbines have reached 46% efficiency.|$|R

Rutgers had survived two close games to reach this point, {{defeating}} 12th-seeded Oregon, 79–76, in the first round, and then upsetting 4th-seeded Iowa State, 62–61 in the second. Their third-round game was not quite so close. Although Rutgers only trailed by two {{towards the end of}} the first period, UT was able to outscore Rutgers by six to close it out, and opened the second half up by building the lead to sixteen. The Scarlet Knights never recovered, losing 92–60. Holdsclaw and Catchings were again the leading scorers, with 25 and 23. The Lady Vols shot 52.2% from the field and forced Rutgers to 27 turnovers.
