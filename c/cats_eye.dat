50|$|<b>Cat's</b> <b>eye</b> really {{became popular}} {{by the end}} of the 19th century when the Duke of Connaught gave a ring with a <b>cat's</b> <b>eye</b> as an {{engagement}} token; this was sufficient to make the stone more popular and increase its value greatly.

50|$|The {{idea for}} the film came during the making of Satya (1998), when {{director}} Ram Gopal Varma pitched {{a story about a}} chain smoker's encounter with someone who despises smoking. Varma later incorporated his own idea of the story as a short segment in his anthology film, Darna Mana Hai (2003). During the shooting of Kashyap's Black Friday, his assistant narrated him a different script about a chain smoker who wakes up without cigarettes and is unable to get any because of a curfew. Kashyap decided to take the story forward, taking inspiration from Quitters, inc and a surreal moment from <b>Cats</b> <b>Eye,</b> subsequently making him develop the story into a darker and more unreal version.|$|E
5000|$|The Church Lady {{is known}} for always wearing a {{matching}} blue and purple sweater/dress set, visible knee-high stockings, {{and a pair of}} <b>cats</b> <b>eye</b> horn-rimmed glasses. She was known for the catchphrases, “Well, isnt that SPE-CIAL?!”, [...] "How con-VEEN-ient!", and “Could it be...SATAN?” (in later years, the latter would always end with a haunting echo). When sufficiently satisfied with herself, she would mug for the camera, while twitching {{the corners of her mouth}} from one side to the other for an indefinite length of time. She also gave advice in response to letters she ostensibly received. Furthermore, whenever she felt that she had demonstrated her superiority, she would do her [...] "Superior dance" [...] in which she would rhythmically strut to organ music (played by an organist named Pearl, who was played by musical director Cheryl Hardwick) in front of her alleged inferiors.

5000|$|The {{book has}} been called [...] "feminist", and more {{specifically}} [...] "vintage Atwood-feminist", but Atwood disagrees, saying, [...] "I wouldnt even call it feminist. Every time you write something {{from the point of}} view of a woman, people say that its feminist." [...] The Penelopiads antagonistic relationship between Penelope and Helen is similar to the relationships of women in Atwoods previous novels: Elaine and Cordelia in <b>Cats</b> <b>Eye,</b> and Iris and Laura in The Blind Assassin, and follows Atwoods doubt of an amicable universal sisterhood. The story does endorse some feminist reassessments of the Odyssey, like Penelope recognizing Odysseus while disguised and that the geese slaughtered by the eagle in Penelopes dream were her maids and not the suitors. Using the maids lecture on anthropology, Atwood satirizes Robert Graves theory of a matriarchal lunar cult in Greek myth. The lecture makes a series of connections, concluding that the rape and execution of the maids by men represent the overthrow of the matriarchal society in favor of patriarchy. The lecture ends with lines from anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss Elementary Structures of Kinship: [...] "Consider us pure symbol. Were no more real than money." ...|$|E
