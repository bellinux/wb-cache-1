50|$|Palm sap begins fermenting {{immediately}} after collection, due to natural yeasts {{in the air}} (often spurred by residual yeast left in the <b>collecting</b> <b>container).</b> Within two hours, fermentation yields an aromatic wine of up to 4% alcohol content, mildly intoxicating and sweet. The wine may be allowed to ferment longer, up to a day, to yield a stronger, more sour and acidic taste, which some people prefer. Longer fermentation produces vinegar instead of stronger wine.|$|E

30|$|Particle size distribution: ~ 300  g of each {{sample was}} placed {{on top of a}} set of sieves (20  cm diameter, {{equipped}} with a <b>collecting</b> <b>container</b> at the bottom and a lid at the top) with the meshes of 20, 10, 7, 5, 2 and 0.5  mm placed in descending order from top to bottom. The entire series of sieves has been subjected to shaking for 5  min with a frequency of 0.5  Hz. At the end of the procedure the various fractions remaining on the sieves and in the lower container were collected and weighed. This datum was used to determine size guide number (SGN, mm) and uniformity index (UI, %) of the pellets: the SGN is the average particle diameter of the product expressed in mm and multiplied by 100; the UI is the ratio between large and small particles multiplied by 100 (Allaire and Parent 2003, 2004).|$|E

40|$|Conventional cell cytometers {{are often}} bulky and thus not {{convenient}} for bio-medical analysis where portable devices are desired. They also {{suffer from the}} drawback of high cost due to the complicated and expensive optical detection system involved. Therefore miniaturizing conventional cell cytometer is highly demanded as it offers an opportunity to transform the conventional bulky systems to more cost-efficient and portable microfluidic cell sorting devices. In addition to the advantages reduced cost and enhanced portability, microfluidic cell sorting devices require only a tiny amount of sample for analysis. In this thesis, one common microfluidic cell sorting device is developed using similar conventional functions and concepts but different sorting method. Unlike most of the conventional cell cytometers in which an electrical field or magnetic field is employed to deflect the charged target cells to the <b>collecting</b> <b>container,</b> microfluidic cell sorting devices use the fluid flow to control {{the movement of the}} targeted cells to the collecting reservoir. By using an electroosmitic pump, the response time of the flow switch is significantly lowered, leading to a much higher sorting efficiency. Despite the advantages of microfluidic cell sorting devices, there are some issues need to be addressed before realization of such devices. For example, more studies are required on the successful integration of the optical elements in the devices. In microfluidic, the transport phenomena is also different from that in macroscopic. Unlike that in macroscopic, surface forces are important in microfluidics. They result in pressure-induced flow which gives the parabolic profile of the velocity along the channel. Also, a plug-like velocity which is generated by the electoosmitic flow is required for the more controllable and accurate detection. To suppress the pressure-driven flow, hydro-resistance elements (Shallow channel network) are implemented on the microfluidic devices. Fabrication of optical elements by deposition of optical materials on glass or silicon wafer has been reported. However, this Micro Electro-Mechanical (MEM) technique requires special equipment and cleanroom facilities used in the semiconductor industry. A good alternative to the MEMS technique is soft lithography where optical elements can be created using polymers. In this work, ultraviolet-sensitive photo resists SU 8 is used to fabricate the microfluidic cell sorting devices and the optical elements. By using the mask with the patterns of the microchannel network and optical elements, the optical elements can be fabricated with the microchannel, eliminating the problem of alignment. Experiments are also conducted to evaluate the integrated optical elements. To prevent cross-contamination, samples are usually prepared and are only mixed inside the microfluidic devices by the embedded mixers. Such embedded mixers, however, pose a great challenge as the small characteristic length of a microfluidic device tends to give a laminar flow and diffusion-dominated mixing. A simple passive micromixer is investigated to find the possibilities to integrate it to the microfluidic devices. To truly understand the diffusional mixing, a Y channel mixer is studied through the numerical and experimental investigations. Based on the results found, a possible design is also proposed and evaluated by experiments...|$|E

In this case study, all import customers in a route must be serviced before all export customers, each customer can be visited more than once and containers are never unloaded or reloaded from the truck chassis along any route. We model the problem using an Integer Linear Programming formulation and propose an Adaptive Guidance metaheuristic. Our extensive computational experiments show that the adaptive guidance algorithm is capable of determining good-quality solutions in many instances of practical or potential interest for the carrier within 10 min of computing time, whereas the mathematical formulation often fails to provide the first feasible solution within 3 h of computing time...|$|R

40|$|To {{help the}} Bosch Car Multimedia Portugal in Ferreiros, Braga {{to reduce its}} costs (both in time and space) with its warehouse, a micro {{simulation}} model is being developed in Simio. Particularly, the tool {{needs to be able}} to model pickers riding milkruns to <b>collect</b> <b>containers</b> of products, from a warehouse, to satisfy the needs of the production lines. In this sense, the storage strategy used on the warehouse, the quantity of requests a picker gets per shift, the time between shifts, the number of types of products, the arrival rate of requests, and the number of milkruns and pickers needs to be adjustable. Additionally, to design the corridors of the warehouse in a configurable way, an Add-in in C#, using the API of Simio, is being developed. Thus, this paper intends to document the first part of the simulation model developed, which consists on the pickers receiving requests and riding their milkruns to <b>collect</b> the respective <b>containers</b> from the warehouse.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the number of two-wheeled {{containers}} at a gathering point on the energetic workload and the work efficiency in refuse collecting was studied in order to design an optimal gathering point for two-wheeled containers. Three sizes of gathering points were investigated, i. e. with 2, 16 and 32 two-wheeled containers at a gathering point. The <b>collecting</b> of two-wheeled <b>containers</b> was simulated in a test circuit. The energetic workload was quantified by the parameters oxygen uptake (1 min(- 1)), heart rate (beats min(- 1)) and perceived exertion.

The maximum acceptable amount of two-wheeled <b>containers</b> <b>collected</b> during an 8 -h working day was estimated using the energetic criterion of a maximum oxygen uptake of 30 % VO 2 max.
