5|$|Although sodium is less {{reactive}} than potassium, {{this process}} works because at such high temperatures potassium is more volatile than sodium and <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> be distilled off, {{so that the}} equilibrium shifts towards the right to produce more potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion.|$|E
5|$|Subdivision rules <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> be {{generalized}} to other dimensions. For instance, barycentric subdivision is used in all dimensions. Also, binary subdivision can {{be generalized}} to other dimensions (where hypercubes get divided by every midplane), as in the proof of the Heine–Borel theorem.|$|E

It also defeated Trevor's Charizard, who <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard Y.|$|E
5|$|Availability of {{substitute}} goods: The {{more and}} closer the substitutes available, {{the higher the}} elasticity is likely to be, as people <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> switch from one good to another if an even minor price change is made; There is a strong substitution effect. If no close substitutes are available, the substitution effect will be small and the demand inelastic.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{tidal force}} from Jupiter and Amalthea's low density and {{irregular}} shape, the escape velocity at its surface points closest to and furthest from Jupiter {{is no more}} than 1 m/s and dust <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> escape from it after, e.g. micrometeorite impacts; this dust forms the Amalthea Gossamer Ring.|$|E
5|$|Horses have an {{advanced}} sense of taste, which {{allows them to}} sort through fodder and choose what they would most like to eat, and their prehensile lips <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> sort even small grains. Horses generally will not eat poisonous plants, however, there are exceptions; horses will occasionally eat toxic amounts of poisonous plants even when there is adequate healthy food.|$|E

5|$|Humpbacks <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> be {{identified}} by their stocky body, obvious hump, black dorsal coloring and elongated pectoral fins. The head and lower jaw are covered with knobs called tubercles, which are hair follicles and are characteristic of the species. The fluked tail, which typically rises above the surface when diving, has wavy trailing edges.|$|E

These include macroalgae like Ulva lactuca, Ceramiumspp., Plocamiumspp., Cladophoraspp., Chorda filum, Fucus vesiculosus, Pylaiellaspp. and the introduced Sargassum muticum; hydrozoans like Obeliaspp. and Tubularia indivisa; bryozoans; tube-building amphipods like Monocorophium acherusicum and Jassa marmorata; and even soft-bodied tunicates like Ascidiella aspersa and Ciona intestinalis.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} crocodilian are traded as exotic pets. They are {{appealing}} when young, and pet-store owners <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> sell them, but crocodilians {{do not make}} good pets; they grow large and are both dangerous and expensive to keep. As they grow older, pet crocodilians are often abandoned by their owners, and feral populations of spectacled caimans exist in the United States and Cuba. Most countries have strict regulations for keeping these reptiles.|$|E
5|$|Shark skeletons {{are very}} {{different}} from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> be crushed under their own weight on land.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch <b>can</b> <b>easily</b> be {{confused}} with the similar downy birch (Betula pubescens). Yet, downy birch are characterised by hairy leaves and young shoots whereas the same parts on silver birch are hairless. The leaf base of silver birch is usually a right angle to the stalk while for downy birch it is rounded. In terms of genetic structure the trees are quite different but do, however occasionally hybridise.|$|E
