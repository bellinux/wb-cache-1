5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi {{as the last}} game in an Ace Attorney trilogy; he also {{wanted it to be}} the final entry in the series, as he felt he had explored Phoenix's character fully. Because he was satisfied with the gameplay in Justice for All, he did not introduce any new gameplay mechanics in Trials and Tribulations. Flashbacks were used as a major theme in the game; this originated in Takumi trying to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of handling dialogue-integrated tutorials, and deciding to use a flashback to a case from when Mia was a rookie attorney.|$|E

500|$|As Edgeworth {{had been}} a popular {{character}} ever since start of the series, Takumi {{found it difficult to}} <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to bring him back without having him, a supposedly great prosecutor, always lose to Phoenix. While he was writing the story for the game's final case, he thought of the idea to have Edgeworth become a player character; he liked this idea so much that he immediately started to rewrite the case. In order to allow Edgeworth to be the player character, {{the first thing he did}} was to [...] "get rid of" [...] Phoenix by having him fall from a bridge into an icy river. He enjoyed writing from another character's perspective, who thought differently from Phoenix; he also used the case to explore the relationship between Edgeworth and Gumshoe. One of the game's episodes had originally been written for Justice for All: it had been intended as the fourth episode of Justice for All, but was cut due to memory limiations, and ended up being reused as the third episode of Trials and Tribulations.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) and FBI agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) {{discover}} that Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) {{has agreed to}} return with his real father, dubbed [...] "Walternate" [...] (Noble), to his own universe called the Other Side, which runs parallel to ours. One of the mysterious Observers (Michael Cerveris) leaves Olivia a note indicating that Peter is named in a prophecy as the one responsible {{for the end of}} the world. To warn Peter of his impending role, the Fringe Division work with biotechnology corporation Massive Dynamic to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to cross over. They form a plan that takes advantage of Olivia's universe-hopping ability, and recruit three other Cortexiphan test subjects who have unique abilities: Nick Lane (David Call), Sally Clark (Pascale Hutton), and James Heath (Omar Metwally), two of whom appeared in previous episodes. The team—composed of Walter, Olivia, Nick, Sally, and James—successfully arrives on the Other Side. James dies shortly after arrival, but the rest manage to escape the alternate reality's Fringe Division, who had used their special technology to detect their arrival. It is revealed that Walternate is the Secretary of Defense on the Other Side.|$|E

500|$|Alan Resnick (portrayed by himself), an {{emerging}} young tech expert and innovator, is {{introduced to the}} viewer. He tells the audience of his four-step program to create a digital avatar {{that acts as a}} backup of its host, granting [...] "the secret to eternal life". He tells the audience of his past: two years ago, Resnick was banished to his couch after getting into a lovers' spat with his wife, Janet. He dreamt of himself in a foggy meadow with an attractive, nude young woman (portrayed by [...] "MKNZ") who calls for him to engage in sex. He initially refuses, but then changes his mind, but before they are able to do so, he is shot with a gun by a nameless man (Ben O'Brien), which totally destroys his face. This gave him the idea to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to digitally back himself up. Two months pass, and he is able to create an [...] "exact digital copy" [...] of himself who calls himself [...] "Teddy" [...] (for unknown reasons). [...] "Teddy", a floating avatar head, acts as the co-host {{for the remainder of the}} program, often interrupting Resnick's speech to talk about his [...] "wife".|$|E
500|$|Because the dialogue-integrated {{tutorial}} in {{the first}} game had been well received, it was considered a major point for future games in the series. In the first game, Takumi had Phoenix being guided through his first trial by the judge and Mia, and for the second game, he had Phoenix suffer from amnesia; when writing the third game, Takumi {{did not know what to}} do, as it would not seem credible if Phoenix had amnesia a second time. Eventually he came up with the idea of using a flashback to a case where Mia had just become an attorney; he developed this idea further, and ended up using flashbacks as a major theme for the game's story. He decided that he wanted to include a case where Mia faces off against Edgeworth back when he was a rookie prosecutor, but encountered a problem: both characters had previously been established as never having lost a single case. Trying to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for a case in the past to work with neither of them winning or losing, he came up with the story for Terry Fawles, who dies during the trial. The game's main theme was [...] "not everything is always what it seems on the surface".|$|E
500|$|Lonsdale's {{employer}} and landlord received {{phone calls from}} Scientology representatives who claimed {{that he was a}} religious bigot and dangerous. Lonsdale was subpoenaed by the Church of Scientology for a deposition in the fall of 2006, and the Church claimed that he belonged to an anti-Scientology group which had previously been barred from protesting in certain areas in downtown Clearwater, the Lisa McPherson Trust. Luke Lirot, the lawyer who defended Lonsdale in the matter, told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "I found him to be quite affable and truly a very intelligent man ... I certainly hope that a very thorough investigation is conducted." [...] In his deposition, Lonsdale stated he was unemployed and began to educate himself about Scientology while working on a photography project on homeless people in Clearwater. After reading more about Scientology, he decided to shed light on the organization and irritate Scientologists. Of the claims Scientology made that Lonsdale was affiliated with the Lisa McPherson Trust, Lirot commented: [...] "It was obvious to everybody {{he had nothing to do}} with the trust, and the trust had been disbanded and dissolved many years prior ... They just wanted to try to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to preclude him from exercising his right to picket in downtown Clearwater, and they were unsuccessful in doing that." ...|$|E

500|$|Another {{example of}} the {{inductive}} composition method {{was the creation of}} the game's title, which was only decided on after the story was completed. It was meant to reflect how the game's story connects the future and the past, with the word [...] "ever" [...] intended to be read with two meanings: [...] "once before" [...] and [...] "someday", but the number [...] "17" [...] was initially simply chosen as Uchikoshi liked the number due to being born on the 17th, and because he liked the transition to [...] "17" [...] from the [...] "7" [...] in Never 7; upon checking the calendar for year spans where dates and days of the week would line up, he found that one such occurrence was the seventeen years between 2017 and 2034; other spans included eleven years, which was too short, and twenty-eight, which was too long. When Uchikoshi considered how to bring characters over from 2017 to 2034, some worked out naturally: Tsugumi was immortal due to being infected with the Curé Virus, You had a clone in 2034, and Sora was an artificial intelligence. He could not <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to make Coco and Sara appear in both 2017 and 2034, but thought that the player probably would not figure it out just from this discrepancy. The one character left was Kaburaki, who would be a teenager in 2017 but in his 30s in 2034; Uchikoshi solved this by infecting him with the Curé Virus, which then led to him making the rest of the 2017 cast infected as well.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team {{intended to}} continue {{the story of the}} previous game in the series in every way with Dual Destinies. They focused on an overarching story and plot twists, and on characters' motives and how they get involved in the story, but not directly on the characters themselves. When deciding which characters to bring back from previous games, {{they did not want to}} bring back anyone only for the sake of bringing them back, instead intending for everyone to have important roles in the story. They considered some characters to [...] "come in sets", such as Apollo and Trucy, which affected which characters to bring back. Miles Edgeworth was brought back as the developers felt that Phoenix needed a character to play off of. Yamazaki said it was difficult to create the new rival character Simon Blackquill, as he had to be at least as unique and memorable as the ones in previous Ace Attorney titles. He came up with the idea that Blackquill would be a convict, thus being the [...] "most criminal prosecutor yet". Blackquill's intelligence and use of psychological manipulation turned out to make trials challenging to write, as Yamazaki kept writing himself into a corner, with it being difficult to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for the protagonist to win. Yamazaki went through several ideas when brainstorming ways for Blackquill to be seen as a difficult opponent, such as making him immortal and two hundred years old, or [...] "super-rich" [...] and able to buy off any witness; these ideas were scrapped due to not fitting into the Ace Attorney series.|$|E

The first [...] "one-armed bandit" [...] was invented in 1887 by Charles Fey of San Francisco, California who devised a simple automatic mechanism with three spinning reels containing {{a total of five}} symbols– horseshoes, diamonds, spades, hearts and a Liberty Bell, which also gave the machine its name.|$|E

[...] Building on her work with the Department of Agriculture documents at LAPL, she devised a system of letters and numbers that denoted the department, division, document type, and volume or series (if needed). [...] This system is now generally referred to Superintendent of Documents Classification, or SuDocs. [...] While she was collecting and organizing, Hasse continued to regularly publish not only bibliographies of government publications, but also items of other interest such as [...] "Travel and Exploration" [...] that appeared in List of Books for Girls and Women and Their Clubs.|$|E
2500|$|To {{build the}} high banking, crews had to {{excavate}} {{over a million}} square yards of soil from the track's infield. Because of the high water table in the area, the excavated hole filled with water to form what {{is now known as}} Lake Lloyd, named after Joseph [...] "Sax" [...] Lloyd, one of the original six members of the Daytona Beach Speedway Authority. (The lake would be stocked with 65,000 fish, and France would arrange speedboat races on it.) 22 tons of lime mortar had to be brought in to form the track's binding base, over which asphalt would be laid. Because of the extreme degree of banking, Moneypenny had to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to pave the incline. He connected the paving equipment to bulldozers anchored {{at the top of the}} banking. This would allow the paving equipment to pave the banking without slipping or rolling down the incline. Moneypenny subsequently patented his construction method and later designed Talladega Superspeedway and Michigan International Speedway. By December 1958, France had begun to run out of money and started relying on race ticket sales to complete construction.|$|E
2500|$|In 1796 he was {{appointed}} one of the twenty-eight members of the Committee on the East-Indies Trade and Possessions (Comité tot den Oost-Indischen Handel en Bezittingen), along with Wybo Fijnje, with whom he quarrelled two years later. [...] The committee had to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> {{of dealing with the}} bankrupt VOC, a symbol of the Ancien Régime's power. The Dutch East India Company was nationalised, its so-called Outer Chambers in Middelburg, Delft, Enkhuizen and Hoorn closed down and its surplus employees dismissed. [...] In 1798 the Unitarists Wiselius, Von Liebeherr, Wybo Fijnje and Quint Ondaatje were involved in the plans of a coup by Daendels. The French ambassador Charles Delacroix was willing to help if the Dutch came up with a substantial financial reward. In 1801, Wiselius wrote a pamphlet making a laughing-stock of Guillelmus Titsingh, a former Dutch East India Company-administrator. As a result, Wiselius was not re-appointed as one of the nine members of the Council of Asian Possessions and Establishments (Raad van Aziatische Bezittingen en Etablissementen). A furious Wiselius accused his former colleagues of mismanagement. Wiselius had more respect for Dirk van Hogendorp, a precursor of Multatuli. In 1807 Herman Willem Daendels was sent to Batavia to prepare for the necessary changes.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, Arthur Laurents stated, [...] "I've <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> {{of doing}} [...] {{that will make}} it {{absolutely}} contemporary without changing a word or a note." [...] He directed a pre-Broadway production of West Side Story at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. that ran from December 15, 2008 through January 17, 2009. The Broadway revival began previews at the Palace Theatre on February 23, 2009 and opened on March 19, 2009. The production wove Spanish lyrics and dialogue into the English libretto. The translations are by Tony Award winner Lin-Manuel Miranda. [...] Laurents stated, [...] "The musical theatre and cultural conventions of 1957 made it next to impossible for the characters to have authenticity. Every member of both gangs was always a potential killer even then. Now they actually will be. Only Tony and Maria try to live in a different world". In August 2009, some of the lyrics for [...] "A Boy Like That" [...] ("Un Hombre Asi") and [...] "I Feel Pretty" [...] ("Me Siento Hermosa"), which were previously sung in Spanish in the revival, were changed back to the original English. [...] However, the Spanish lyrics sung by the Sharks in the [...] "Tonight" [...] (Quintet) remained in Spanish.|$|E
2500|$|In his May 2014 {{interview}} with NBC News, Snowden accused the U.S. government {{of trying to}} use one position here or there in his career to distract from the totality of his experience, downplaying him as a [...] "low level analyst." [...] In his words, he was [...] "trained as a spy {{in the traditional sense}} of the word in that I lived and worked undercover overseas—pretending to work in a job that I'm not—and even being assigned a name that was not mine." [...] He said he'd worked for the NSA undercover overseas, and for the DIA had developed sources and methods to keep information and people secure [...] "in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world. So when they say I'm a low-level systems administrator, that I don't know what I'm talking about, I'd say it's somewhat misleading." [...] In a June {{interview with}} Globo TV, Snowden reiterated that he [...] "was actually functioning at a very senior level." [...] In a July interview with The Guardian, Snowden explained that, during his NSA career, [...] "I began to move from merely overseeing these systems to actively directing their use. Many people don’t understand that I was actually an analyst and I designated individuals and groups for targeting." [...] Snowden subsequently told Wired that while at Dell in 2011, [...] "I would sit down with the CIO of the CIA, the CTO of the CIA, the chiefs of all the technical branches.
