Some of their properties include light weight, tiny structures, remote sensing, electro-magnetic interference, and more importantly they are immune to any hazardous environment, particularly they can withstand a high temperatures up to over 1000 ° C, and they are immune to electro-magnetic interference. They can be easily embedded inside the materials like composites with minimum effect on their original structure. The light weight of composite materials makes optical sensors embedded in <b>composite</b> <b>package</b> very suitable for many applications including airspace industry. The <b>composite</b> <b>packages</b> can be tailored to achieve desired mechanical characteristics. Moreover, they can be applied as extra protection for embedded fiber optics. In this work, phase-modulated sensor, Michelson interferometer, was fabricated and embedded in <b>composite</b> <b>package.</b> Then the package was glued on an aluminum substrate. The resultant structure {{was used to measure}} strain in the aluminum substrate. The comprehensive study was performed in evaluating different lay-ups of the <b>composite</b> <b>package</b> in order to find the best match between the composite materials and the substrate in term of stiffness. ANSYS simulations were performed to study the influence of the resin pocket on the strain transmission to the optical sensor, dependence of the thickness of the adhesive layer on the strain readings on the <b>composite</b> <b>package</b> and on the optical sensor. The results of the simulations showed that optical sensor within resin pocket created by the resin and carbon fiber will give small alteration in strain readings between composite material and optical fiber. Static tensile tests were investigated on different lay-ups of the laminate, adhesives, composite materials, and thickness of the adhesive layers. Difference in strain readings between aluminum and optical sensor were smaller due to good transmission of the strain through epoxy adhesive layer with thickness a 100 om.

Especially, cellulose nanocomposites are best representative eco-friendly material as compared with nanocomposites reinforced with inorganic nanoscale fillers such as nanoclay, montmorillonite, mica, and silica. Natural filler such as cellulose nanofiber from palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) has drawn bigger attention as it promotes eco-friendly character. In current study, cellulose nanofiber (CNF) was prepared through pretreatment to remove noncellulosic content and then undergoes acid hydrolysis process. Starch-based nanocomposite film was formed by incorporation of 2 – 10 % CNF per weight of starch into the film matrix. The nanocomposite film that formed appears translucent and easy to handle. However, the film becomes more opaque as percentage of CNF incorporation increased.

Adding Zn to the Cu wetting layer suppressed {{the formation of}} a large Ag 3 Sn plate in the solder and delayed interfacial intermetallic compound (IMC) growth in the solder/Cu-Zn interfaces. Formation of Cu 3 Sn IMC and microvoids was not observed in the Cu 6 Sn 5 /CuZn interface during thermal aging. The drop impact reliability of the Cu-Zn/SAC/Cu-Zn solder joints was superior to that of Cu/SAC/Cu solder joints, both before and after aging. The drop impact performance of the Cu-Zn specimens was similar whether their Cu-Zn layers were electroplated in cyanide or non-cyanide solution. Drop impact reliability of both Cu and Cu-Zn specimens decreased after aging due to IMC growth and/or microvoid formation in the solder interfaces. Interfacial microstructure influenced the failure mode of the solder joints. For Cu specimens, the dominant failure sites were a Cu 6 Sn 5 /Cu interface before aging and a Cu 3 Sn/Cu interface after aging. The formation of a large Ag 3 Sn plate facilitated crack growth. For Cu-Zn specimens, the crack always propagated inside the Cu 6 Sn 5 layer. Microstructural changes in the solder interfaces arising from the addition of Zn contributed to the improvement of drop impact reliability of SAC solder joints.

Edible films need to be developing as an effort to create an environment zero waste. In the formation, process of edible film requires a precise formulation in order to form a mass that is able to function properly.

Principles for classification, packing requirements, testing procedures shall be simple and clear and guarantee that a minimum level of safety can be achieved without advanced technical equipment and expertise. No requirements concerning test temperatures are given in the regulations but in the standard SS-EN-ISO 16104 : 2003 “Packaging – Transport packaging for dangerous goods – Test Methods” the internal hydraulic pressure test, for plastics drums, jerricans and <b>composite</b> <b>packaging,</b> shall be performed at a temperature of + 12 °C, otherwise the internal test pressure shall be adjusted with a pressurization factor corresponding to the temperatures used in the test. At temperatures below + 12 +/- 2 °C the test pressure is increased and if the temperature is higher the pressure is lowered. Correction factors exist from + 2 °C to + 20 °C, and for all temperatures above + 20 °C the correction factor {{is the same as}} for + 20 °C. Neither ADR, IMDG-code, ICAO-TI or the UN-recommendations recommend any test temperature. The aim with this project was to perform internal pressure test at different water temperatures. Three jerricans of each type were tested at the following temperatures: + 3, + 20, + 40 and + 55 °C. As {{can be seen in the}} test results the burst pressure decreases substantially with rising temperature. For jerrican A the burst pressure is reduced from 234 kPa at + 3 °C to 175 kPa at + 20 °C, 151 kPa at 40 °C and 114 kPa at + 55 °C. At + 55 °C the burst pressure is reduced to less than half what it was at + 3 °C. Jerrican B is also reduced from 545 kPA at + 3 °C to 226 kPa at + 55 °C while jerrican C is only reduced from 185 kPa to 136 kPa in the same temperature interval.

Based {{on recent}} studies, {{it has been}} shown that the incorporation of nano fillers, such as cellulose nanofiber (CNF), into a polymer matrix can greatly improve its mechanical properties. Interestingly, the incorporation of CNF into antimicrobial packaging enhances the results of antimicrobial efficacy towards food shelf life. Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) from oil palm empty fruit bunch was prepared, through pretreatment, to remove non-cellulosic content and then underwent an hydrolysis process involving strong acid. Starch-based nanocomposite film was formed by the incorporation of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 % CNF, per weight of starch, into the film matrix. The nanocomposite film appeared translucent and easy to handle however, the film became more opaque as the percentage of CNF was increased. The surface morphology of the film was observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy to analyze the effect of CNF addition on the film surface. Mechanical properties such as tensile strength, percentage of elongation and Young’s Modulus were determined using a tensile test machine. Tensile strength of the starch-based film without CNF (as a control) was 3. 1 MPa which increased to 4. 68 MPa with the addition of 2 % CNF. However, the strength was gradually decreased with the addition of more than 2 % CNF. Optimum Young’s Modulus was also detected at 2 % CNF incorporation. The percentage of elongation gradually decreased from 1. 79 % to 0. 89 % for film with 0 % to 10 % CNF loading, respectively. Influence of CNF addition in antimicrobial film with regard to its antimicrobial properties and food shelf life were also studied. Antimicrobial composite film was prepared by blending 1 to 9 ratio of chitosan per weight of starch while antimicrobial nanocomposite film was prepared by adding 2 % of CNF and the control film was formed using starch only. The antimicrobial test showed that starch/chitosan with CNF gave 30 % better bacterial inhibition towards Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis compared to the starch/chitosan control film. However, in Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli starch/chitosan with CNF <b>composite</b> <b>packaging</b> gave rise to a similar inhibition zone as the control starch/chitosan packaging. Results showed that nano-reinforced starch/chitosan packaging was able to retain moisture in a tomato 7 days longer than the control starch and starch/chitosan composites which gradually changed the tomato’s colour which highlighted the slow ripening process and lessened mould infection.

40|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} {{have become}} {{the main energy source}} for hybrid and all-electric vehicles due to their high energy density. However, the incorporation of Li-ion batteries within vehicles presents two unique challenges. First, the batteries must be kept cool during operation to ensure optimal performance. Second, the batteries must be kept safe from damage {{in the event of a}} crash, as damaged batteries can develop short circuits that lead to cell overheating and fires. Most electric vehicles address these goals with a heavy, complex battery packaging scheme. Aluminum cooling fins that circulate a coolant are stacked between batteries for thermal management and the batteries are encased in steel for crash protection. Here we propose a more elegant solution using microvascular fiber-reinforced composites. Microvascular composites contain internal channel networks for fluid flow and have shown promise for applications such as self-healing and thermal management [1]. For our packaging scheme, batteries are embedded in structural carbon fiber composites that contain cooling channels. The flow of coolant through the composite provides thermal management, whereas the strong, energy absorbing carbon fiber material can protect batteries in the event of a crash. Cooling simulations carried out with ANSYS Fluent confirm the feasibility of the microvascular packaging scheme. To validate these results, microvascular carbon fiber composites are manufactured using vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding. Microchannels are incorporated using sacrificial fibers placed between fabric layers during layup and removed after cure. Nylon sacrificial fibers are removed mechanically after cure, whereas sacrificial polylactide (PLA) fibers are removed through vaporization at elevated temperature [1]. To create more complex channels such as curved and branching channels, a sheet of sacrificial PLA is cut in the desired shape by a laser cutter. The patterned sheets are then placed between fabric layers and vaporized after cure. Cooling performance of microvascular <b>composite</b> <b>packaging</b> is experimentally determined for battery simulated conditions. The surface temperature of each panel is measured using an IR camera while the panel is exposed to a constant heat flux from below during cooling with a constant flow rate of ethylene glycol coolant. Thermocouples are also employed to track the temperature rise of the coolant through the panel. Good agreement between experimental results and simulations are obtained across a wide range of heat fluxes, coolant flow rates, and channel architectures. Finally, a gradient-based optimization scheme is used to find optimal channel designs for various thermal loads. Objective functions are set to minimize panel temperature, with constraints set for the coolant pressure drop and channel volume fraction. The efficiency of the optimization procedure is enhanced through the use of an interface-enriched generalized finite element method [2] specially developed for the thermal analysis of microvascular media. Flexibility in channel shape is achieved through the use of nonuniform rational B-spline representations. REFERENCES [1] Esser-Kahn, A., et al. Adv. Mater. 2011, 23, 3654 – 3658.

For high-power white LEDs, this combination cannot provide long-term stable work because of photo-degradation of the organic epoxy resin under high irradiation and high temperatures. Here we develop resin-free phosphor (Tb(1 -n) Cen) (3) Al 5 O 12 -Al 2 O 3 eutectic mixed crystals (Ce: TAG-Al 2 O 3) to eliminate the photo-degradation issue of the organic material. They were grown by optical floating zone method. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy show that these materials have typical eutectic mixed crystal structure of sapphire and garnet phases, in which lamellar spacing is in an order of tens of microns. The doped Ce 3 + ions do not influence basic structure of TAG crystal. Ce 3 + ion replaces Tb 3 + ion rather than Al 3 + ion. Photoluminescence emission and excitation properties of the eutectic mixed crystals were investigated. They get to maximal value with 2. 0 % Ce- 3 +,Ce- and have wide excitation band at 470 nm. Luminous efficiency of eutectic mixed crystal- packaged LED is {{higher than that of}} particle- resin <b>composite</b> <b>packaged</b> LED. These results show that Ce: TAG-Al 2 O 3 eutectic mixed crystals are promising phosphor for white LEDs...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Today, {{sustainable}} {{competitive advantage}} derives from strenuous efforts to identify, cultivate, and exploit an organization’s core competencies. This calls for relentless design of strategic architecture, deployment of competence carriers, {{and commitment to}} collaborate across silos. Put simply, core competencies {{are the product of}} collective learning: their tangible fruits are <b>composite</b> <b>packages</b> of products and services that anticipate and meet demand. Knowledge is what you learn from experience before, during, and after the event. Since it is both a thing and a flow, the best way to manage knowledge is to cater at all times to the environment in which it can be identified, created, stored, shared, and used. Tools, methods, and approaches are needed to enable that. And so, to drive development forward and enhance its effects, the Asian Development Bank has, since 2008, published the Knowledge Solutions series, available at www. adb. org/knowledgesolutions. It aims to build competencies in the areas of strategy development, management techniques, collaboration mechanisms, knowledge sharing and learning, and knowledge capture and storage—all of which are essential to high-performance organizations...|$|R
40|$|SAP {{has been}} {{delivering}} on its Sugar industry strategy by expanding its capabilities for manufacturing and supply chain management, broadening its <b>composite</b> <b>package</b> applications {{in areas such}} as emissions management, pricing management, and manufacturing dashboards, and focusing on mid-market companies. To implement an integrated system of production planning and materials management, there must have a central database wherein anyone in the company can find out all {{there is to know about}} any material passing through the plant. Everyone must use the same rules and data structures when they enter data about material details. The integration of all material data in a single database object eliminates redundant data storage. Areas such as purchasing, inventory management, material requirements planning (MRP), invoice verification, and so on, can all use the same data. By implementing SAP (MM-Module) in sugar industry for Material requirement planning, the product can be ordered and received within safety period. Based on material group classified under ABC analysis. Planning can also be done on priority by calling vendors for particular commodities through onlin...|$|R
50|$|The {{brakes on}} the F430 were {{designed}} in close cooperation with Brembo (who did the calipers and discs) and Bosch (who did the electronics package), {{resulting in a}} new cast-iron alloy for the discs. The new alloy includes molybdenum which has better heat dissipation performance. The F430 was also available with the optional Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) ceramic <b>composite</b> brake <b>package.</b> Ferrari claims the carbon ceramic brakes will not fade even after 300-360 laps at their test track.|$|R
40|$|Nanofibrillated cellulose, NFC, is an {{interesting}} wood fibre-based material that could be utilized in coatings, foams, <b>composites,</b> <b>packages,</b> dispersions, and emulsions, due to its high tensile strength and barrier properties, light weight, and stabilizing features. To improve applicability and properties of NFC, modification of its surface properties is often needed. In this study, the applicability of laccase-aided surface modification with hydrophobic dodecyl gallate (DOGA) on unbleached NFC was investigated. Also, laccase-catalyzed polymerization of DOGA and other phenolic compounds with lignin moieties was investigated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS). NFC modified with T. hirsuta-based laccase and DOGA showed decreased hydrophilicity, {{as compared with the}} native NFC, when coated on a paper surface. When dried as free-standing films, the surface properties of chemo-enzymatically modified NFC resembled those of the native NFC. The effect of modification was thus greatly influenced by different surface formation in differently prepared samples. Also, changing of the dispersion properties of DOGA by enzymatic polymerization affected the surface properties of the dried NFC samples. Covalent bonding between DOGA and NFC was not the main factor affecting the surface properties of the NFC in free-standing films or coatings...|$|R
