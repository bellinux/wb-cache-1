5|$|<b>Common</b> <b>problems</b> women {{experience}} post-SCI are pain with intercourse and difficulty achieving orgasm. Around half {{of women with}} SCI are able to reach orgasm, usually when their genitals are stimulated. Some women report the sensation of orgasm {{to be the same}} as before the injury, and others say the sensation is reduced.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{new engine}} was plagued with problems, such as {{failure of the}} {{accessory}} gear trains and coolant jackets, and several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set. Early production Merlins were also unreliable: <b>Common</b> <b>problems</b> were cylinder head cracking, coolant leaks, and excessive wear to the camshafts and crankshaft main bearings.|$|E
5|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) is {{the most}} commonly transmitted sexually transmitted infection, affecting both men and women. While most infections are asymptomatic and are cleared by the immune system, some types of the virus cause genital warts, and other types, if untreated, cause various forms of cancer, including cervical cancer, and penile cancer. Genital warts and cervical cancer {{are the two most}} <b>common</b> <b>problems</b> resulting from HPV.|$|E

50|$|A <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> {{encountered}} {{during a}} side split is {{pain in the}} hip joints. Usually, {{the reason for this}} is that the split is being performed improperly (the pelvis may need to be tilted forward). Another <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> encountered during splits (both front and side) is pain in the knees.|$|R
30|$|The major <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> of {{providing}} all these {{services to the}} poor is that the transaction size is very small. As a result, any processing cost, or transaction cost, becomes {{a high percentage of}} the transaction amount. This makes the product very expensive for commercial banks and formal financial institutions to provide these services to the poor, who therefore remain excluded. A second <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> is that the poor not only lack financial capital but are also often socially excluded and lack bridges to rich people. A third <b>common</b> <b>problem</b> is that they are often uneducated, even illiterate, and excluded from technological innovations.|$|R
5|$|Although clepsydrae {{were more}} useful than sundials—they {{could be used}} indoors, during the night, and also when the sky was cloudy—they were not as {{accurate}}; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks. Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making {{the reading of the}} clock more precise and convenient. One of the more <b>common</b> <b>problems</b> in most types of clepsydrae was caused by water pressure: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman horologists beginning in 100, and improvements continued {{to be made in the}} following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms. There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{problems}} with sexual functioning mentioned by participants in this study, the most <b>common</b> <b>problems</b> listed for males were experiencing anxiety about performing sexually (81.4%) and premature ejaculation (74.4%). Other <b>common</b> <b>problems</b> included issues becoming erect and difficulties with ejaculation. Generally, most problems were not experienced on a chronic basis. <b>Common</b> <b>problems</b> for girls included difficulties with sexual climax (orgasm) (86.7%), not feeling sexually interested during a sexual situation (81.2%), unsatisfactory vaginal lubrication (75.8%) anxiety about performing sexually (75.8%) and painful intercourse (25.8%). Most problems listed by the girls were not persistent problems. However, inability to experience orgasm {{seemed to be an}} issue that was persistent for some participants.|$|E

25|$|Gait {{abnormality}} is a {{deviation from}} normal walking (gait). Watching a patient walk {{is the most}} important part of the neurological examination. Normal gait requires that many systems, including strength, sensation and coordination, function in an integrated fashion. Many <b>common</b> <b>problems</b> in the nervous system and musculoskeletal system will show up in the way a person walks.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the patellar ligament, the {{hamstring}} tendon's fixation to {{the bone}} can be affected by motion after surgery. Therefore, a brace {{is often used to}} immobilize the knee for one to two weeks. Evidence suggests that the hamstring tendon graft does as well, or nearly as well, as the patellar ligament graft in the long term. <b>Common</b> <b>problems</b> during recovery include strengthening of the quadriceps, T-band, and calf muscles.|$|E
25|$|This {{material}} is particularly {{popular due to}} its consistent supplies, huge quantities and clean material. The <b>common</b> <b>problems</b> with this material are the presence of ilmenite and chloride compounds. Since the material has been naturally crushed and ground on the beaches for past centuries, the {{material is}} normally available in fine sizes only. Most of the garnet at the Tuticorin beach in south India is 80mesh, and ranges from 56mesh to 100mesh size.|$|E
25|$|Assemblies, secret societies, {{and other}} groups play an {{important}} role in keeping the Duala unified, helping them set goals, and giving them a venue to find solutions to <b>common</b> <b>problems.</b> Chief among these is the Ngondo, an assembly of important chiefs. Another of these is the muemba (plural: miemba), a grouping of all Duala of a certain age range or tribal clan. The miemba serve to let their members network and socialise. Other secret societies include the Ekongolo, Jengu, Losango, and Munji.|$|E

30|$|The {{motivation}} for the <b>common</b> element <b>problem</b> is mainly due to its possible applications to mathematical modeling of concrete complex <b>problems.</b> The <b>common</b> element <b>problems</b> include mini-max problems, complementarity <b>problems,</b> equilibrium <b>problems,</b> <b>common</b> fixed point <b>problems</b> and variational inequalities as special cases; see, for example, [1 – 35] and the references therein.|$|R
40|$|I {{develop the}} micro-foundations of a {{resource}} curse process in small-scale alluvial diamond mining in poor countries. I identify a <b>commons</b> <b>problem</b> and gambling for resurrection {{as sources of}} labour inefficiency induced by mining institutions. I show that the <b>commons</b> <b>problem</b> lowers aggregate output. Thus, I provide another perspective to {{the debate on the}} role of institutions in economic development, focusing on the industrial organization of diamond mining. I also contribute to the literature on the <b>commons</b> <b>problem</b> and gambling for resurrection by showing that they occur in alluvial diamond mining. The labour inefficiencies help explain why Sierra Leone, with liberal access to its diamond mines, is poorer than Namibia and Botswana, with restricted access; and why African countries with alluvial diamonds tend to be conflict-prone...|$|R
25|$|In 1946, Praja Mandals {{of various}} states merged {{to form a}} statewide {{organization}} and named it Rajputana Prantiya Sabha. Sukhadia was inducted in Executive Committee of this newly formed organization. Party meetings were held {{in one of the}} Rajputana provinces in every two-three months where representatives of different provinces discussed and debated on <b>common</b> <b>problems</b> of the states. Sukhadia’s matter-of-fact and efficient problem solving tactics were valued highly in these meetings that earned him recognition of top leaders in the state.|$|E
25|$|A {{proof that}} showed that P ≠ NP would lack the {{practical}} computational benefits of a proof that P = NP, but would nevertheless represent a very significant advance in computational complexity theory and provide guidance for future research. It would allow one to show in a formal way that many <b>common</b> <b>problems</b> cannot be solved efficiently, so that the attention of researchers can be focused on partial solutions or solutions to other problems. Due to widespread belief in P ≠ NP, much of this focusing of research has already taken place.|$|E
25|$|The {{advanced}} weaponry led {{to massive}} casualty counts. Neither Japan nor Russia had {{prepared for the}} number of deaths that would occur in this new kind of warfare, or had the resources to compensate for these losses. This also left its impression on society at large, with the emergence of transnational and nongovernmental organizations, like the Red Cross, becoming prominent after the war. The emergence of such organizations can be regarded as the beginning of a meshing together of civilizations through the identification of <b>common</b> <b>problems</b> and challenges, a slow process dominating much of the 20th century.|$|E
