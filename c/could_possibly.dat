5|$|Official {{production}} for FutureSex/LoveSounds started in December 2005. When production began, Jive Records Chairman and CEO, Barry Weiss, asked when the album would be completed, to which Timberlake replied that it <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> take a year. The title was not finalized until Jive Records gave Timberlake a deadline on finishing {{what would become}} FutureSex/LoveSounds. The collective thought the album is comparable with Michael Jackson's landmark record, Thriller, dubbing their own as Thriller 2006.|$|E
5|$|On 9 June 2016, The Sydney Morning Herald {{reported}} that a man had found what <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be debris from the aircraft at a location on Kangaroo Island, southern Australia.

5|$|Shatner's cut ran {{slightly}} over two hours (not including end credits or the opticals), which Paramount thought was too long. Their target runtime was one hour forty-five minutes, which would guarantee twice-nightly theatrical screenings. Bennett was handed {{the task of}} shortening the film's running time, despite Shatner's view that nothing <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be removed. Shatner was horrified by Bennett's edit, and the two haggled over what parts to restore or cut.|$|E
5|$|St. Teresa of Ávila (15151582) a Doctor of the Church, practiced contemplative {{prayer for}} periods of one hour at a time, twice a day. St. Teresa {{believed}} {{that no one}} who was faithful {{to the practice of}} meditation <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> lose his soul. Her writings are viewed as fundamental teachings in Christian spirituality.|$|E
5|$|The {{juvenile}} {{resembles the}} adult in plumage, but the areas {{corresponding to the}} adult black feathers are browner and less glossy. The scapulars, wing and upper tail coverts have pale tips. The legs, bill and bare skin around the eyes are greyish green. It <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> {{be confused with the}} juvenile yellow-billed stork, but the latter has paler wings and mantle, a longer bill and white under the wings.|$|E

5|$|At the {{opposite}} end, at Ysgwrfa, the final five locks before Glynneath have been severed by a realignment {{of the road}} and the construction of a culvert, but the road has carried a lot less traffic since the A465 bypass was opened, and <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be rerouted along its original course, where the bridge over the canal still exists. The Neath Canal Act has not been repealed, and so there is still a right of navigation along this section, which should ease the process of reinstating it. The terminus would then be near the Lamb and Flag public house, south of the final two locks, which are unlikely to be restored.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of einsteinium, any primordial einsteinium, that is einsteinium that <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of einsteinium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, all terrestrial einsteinium is produced in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few years}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium, including einsteinium, occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so. Einsteinium was observed in Przybylski's Star in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{characteristically}} intermittent eruptions {{of active}} volcanoes such as Lassen Peak, {{there is some}} threat from the volcanoes of the LVNP. Dacitic explosive eruptions have taken place within the last 50,000 years at Lassen Peak, Chaos Crags, and Sunflower Flat, and effusive eruptions of basalt have occurred at Tumble Buttes, Hat Mountain, and Prospect Peak. Pyroclastic flows and lahars could easily occur near glaciated areas and in river valleys like Hat Creek Valley. In addition to the volcanic hazards that <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> occur, one volcano did erupt in the 20th century in LVNP: (Lassen Peak). Lassen's eruptions (1914-21, though most activity occurred between 1914-17) were very small compared to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} sinkhole's collapse, there were plans {{to fill it}} in with a soil cement made from cement, limestone, and water known locally as lodocreto ("mudcrete"). This {{substance}} was also used {{to fill in the}} 2007 Guatemala City sinkhole. However, another technique, which geologists call the graded-filter technique, in which the sinkhole is filled with successive layers of boulders, smaller rocks, and gravel, <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be a better solution. This is because filling the hole in with cement diverts water runoff to other areas, potentially increasing the risk of sinkholes occurring {{in other parts of the}} city. The graded-filter technique, on the other hand, allows water to seep through.|$|E
5|$|On Jupiter, cirrus {{clouds are}} {{composed}} of ammonia. When Jupiter's South Equatorial Belt disappeared, one hypothesis put forward by Glenn Orten was that a large quantity of ammonia cirrus clouds had formed above it, hiding it from view. NASA's Cassini probe detected these clouds on Saturn and thin water-ice cirrus on Saturn's moon Titan. Cirrus clouds composed of methane ice exist on Uranus. On Neptune, thin wispy clouds which <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be cirrus have been detected over the Great Dark Spot. As on Uranus, these are probably methane crystals.|$|E
5|$|Peter Milner, in {{a review}} in the Canadian Journal of Psychology, noted the book was short on {{concrete}} details on implementing the TOTE strategy. He also critically viewed the book as {{not being able to}} tie its model to details from neurophysiology at a molecular level. Per him, the book covered only the brain at the gross level of lesion studies, showing that some of its regions <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> implement some TOTE strategies, without giving a reader an indication as to how the region could implement the strategy.|$|E

5|$|Scientific {{analyses}} of the composition of durian aroma found numerous volatile compounds including esters, ketones, and different sulphur compounds, with no agreement on which may be primarily responsible for the distinctive odour. People in South East Asia with frequent exposures to durian are able to easily distinguish its sweet-like ketones and esters scent from rotten or putrescine odours which are from volatile amines and fatty acids. Developmental or genetic differences in olfactory perception and mapping within the brain (for e.g. anterior piriform cortex to the orbitofrontal cortex) <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> explain why some individuals are unable to differentiate these smells and find this fruit noxious whereas others find it extremely pleasant and appealing.|$|E
5|$|Spiroplasma is a cell wall–deficient {{bacterium}} {{related to}} Mycoplasma, which some think {{may be the}} cause of the TSEs. The lack of a cell wall means it is not susceptible to conventional antibiotics such as penicillin, which target cell wall synthesis. Frank O. Bastian of Louisiana State University first discovered Spiroplasma-like inclusions in the brain of a CJD patient during an autopsy in 1979 and has hypothesized that this bacterium <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> {{be the cause of}} the TSEs.|$|E
5|$|The CGS {{warned that}} {{aftershocks}} were {{expected in the}} days following the earthquake and they <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> continue for months. They recommended that buildings be evacuated {{in the event of an}} aftershock. The mining regulator's chief inspector of mines David Msiza asked mining companies in affected areas, including Klerksdorp, Carletonville and Rustenburg, to undertake underground inspections to ensure no miners were trapped and the working conditions were safe for miners. AngloGold Ashanti denied responsibility for the earthquake, saying it occurred away from its mining infrastructure.|$|E
