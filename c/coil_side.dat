50|$|The {{stator core}} is built with lamination's of cold rolled {{grain-oriented}} sheet steel 0.013 in (0.033cm) thick, insulated {{from each other}} with insuline. The number of segments per circle is arranged so that the maximum practical percentage of core flux is {{in the direction of}} the oriented grain. The rings of lamination's are built into a skeleton frame which is flexibly supported inside the main stator frame to prevent double-frequency vibrations being transmitted to the foundations. Axial gas passages are provided within the core by holes punched in the lamination's, which line up throughout its length. The ends of the core are divided axially by spacers into a number of radial ducts. These ducts form the gas inlet and outlet passages for the axial gas passages. Separate radial ducts feed the extreme ends of the core with cold gas to cater for the increased heating experienced at the core ends during leading power factor operation. Each <b>coil</b> <b>side</b> of the stator winding consists of rectangular copper tubes, each tube being insulated with resin-impregnated glass braid, and the tubes are transposed within the coil length by the Roebel method to minimise stray copper losses. Inlet and outlet manifolds are arranged at opposite ends of the windings and all coil sides are fed in parallel from these. The water connections between the manifolds and coil sides are made with flexible hoses of insulating material. The electrical connections between coil sides consist of flexible copper straps, bolted and sweated to contact blocks which are brazed to the conductor tubes near to the end of each <b>coil</b> <b>side.</b> The rings used to connect up the phase groups to the terminals are also water cooled, the flow through these being in parallel with the flow through the coil sides.|$|E

We suggest from our results, similar to other authors, that plasticizers are able to decrease viscous dissipation bymodifying the flocculation state of the system, which, in turn, impacts the way shear localizes. Our experimental results suggest that shear concentrates in fluid layers, the thickness of which scales with the surface-to-surface separating distance between cement grains imposed by the adsorbed polymer conformation. These effects being identical for all polymers, we suggest that the residual difference between polymers in the finalmacroscopic viscosity comes from themore or less pronounced increase in the local viscosity of the interstitial fluid between neighboring particles. This increase could either be correlated to the concentration of non-adsorbed coils in the interstitial fluid or to the local concentration of adsorbed <b>coil</b> <b>side</b> chains...|$|E

As already demonstrated {{in a previous}} work, x-ray diffraction patterns from hard alpha-keratin fibers in the 5. 15 A meridian zone reflect the global configuration of the chi(1) dihedral angle of the coiled <b>coil</b> <b>side</b> chains.

The best one for building a realistic coiled coil structure consists of placing the side chains using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, followed by side chain positioning using SMD or SCWRL procedures.

40|$|One-side heated {{helically}} coiled tubes, {{which are}} generally applied in various industrial {{applications such as}} the water cooled wall in power plant boilers though, have not been thoroughly studied. To investigate the flow and heat transfer characteristics in this case, numerical simulation of the flow in a helically coiled tube is performed under uniform and non-uniform (heating on the inner <b>coil</b> <b>side</b> wall) heat flux boundary conditions for both laminar and turbulent flows. Temperature distributions, secondary flow distributions, average Nusselt number variation with respect to Reynolds number and local Nusselt number along the periphery {{on the wall in}} the fully developed section are discussed contrastively under the two different heating conditions. It is found that the secondary flow distributions are hardly affected by changing heating method, however, a larger temperature gradient can be found for one-side heating condition. The average Nusselt numbers are close for laminar flow under the two heating methods, but one-side heating shows 7 – 10 % lower average Nusselt numbers than uniform heating for turbulent flow, thus a new correlation of average Nusselt number for turbulent flow and one-side heating is proposed. Furthermore, a special point on the inner wall where the local Nusselt numbers are almost the same when carrying out different heating conditions in laminar and turbulent flows is found, which should be useful for measuring unknown parameters...|$|E
40|$|Improving {{chilled water}} delta-T, {{which is the}} {{temperature}} difference of chilled water supply and return temperature, in campus buildings that are connected to a central distribution loop will not only improve the power consumption of the building through reduced tertiary (building) pumping power but {{the impact on the}} central distribution system and chiller efficiencies will be even greater. A degraded delta-T is almost inevitable and it can be expected to fall to about one-half to two-thirds of design at low loads (Taylor, 2002) due to various causes, such as air entering and leaving temperatures, chilled water supply temperature, type and effectiveness of flow control valves, tertiary connection configuration types and operation, coil cooling loads, air economizers, etc. However, in most variable-flow chilled water with 2 -way control valve systems, the root cause of low delta-T is at <b>coil</b> <b>side</b> (Zhang, 2012), for example the geometric configuration of coil.

HTS coils were made using Ag-clad (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 +x HTS wire prepared by the powder-in-tube technique. The HTS wire was characterised as a conductor. The anisotropic HTS wire has a strongly magnetic-field-dependent critical current, which causes critical cunent degradation when used {{in the form of}} a coil. The magnetic field behaviour of the HTS coil was studied with respect to its critical cunent and magnetic field properties. HTS solenoid and pancake coils were produced using 2 ̆ 2 react and wind 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 wind and react 2 ̆ 2 procedures. Experiments which were carried out included magnetic field measurements of the HTS coils in DC and AC magnetic fields, and critical current ampere-turns when used as a magnetic core bias winding. The magnetic field distribution of the HTS coils was also investigated using a magnetic field analysis computer program. The magnetic field in the radial direction (By) (//c-axis) at the HTS <b>coil</b> <b>side</b> 2 ̆ 7 s edge has the most influence on the HTS coil performance at 77 K. The experimental results and analysis provide basic information for the design and operation of a HTS coil made from the anisotropic Ag-clad (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 +x wire. The designed electrical fault crrent limiter was based on the principle of a saturable magnetic core reactor, where a DC bias winding with a large number of ampere-turns is required to generate a high magnetic motive force (mmf) on a magnetic core. The HTS coil was also studied for use in this device as the DC bias winding. A small laboratory device rated at 3. 5 kW was made and tested to investigate the electrical behaviour of the saturable magnetic core fault cunent limiter and the HTS coil in this application. The electrical behaviour of this fault cunent limiter was also analysed using the modified device ψ-I characteristics, and also considered for application in a 6 kV power distribution system. The results show that this fault cunent limiter restricts fault cunents effectively both in the transient and steady states. A high voltage generator device was made and analysed with regard to using a HTS wire inductor. A laboratory high voltage generator device was built, based on a R-C-L resonant circuit, where large inductance and low resistance were required to generate high voltages from a low voltage battery source. Analysis showed that by using an HTS inductor to reduce the circuit resistance, the build-up voltage could be significantly increased. 1. 2 kV was generated using a small hybrid inductor from a 12 V battery source, and the potential build-up voltage when using a larger HTS inductor was shown to be very high. Both the electrical fault cunent limiter device and the electronic high voltage generator were analysed from measurements and simulations. With improvements in critical cunents and long lengths of Ag-clad (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 +x wires, HTS coils with high values of critical ampere-turns could be achieved at 77 K operating temperature. These will enable the above HTS applications to be practicable in electrical engineering...|$|E

40|$|Linear {{induction}} motors commonly use {{double layer}} windings, which produce good sinusoidal travelling fields, but have relatively bulky end windings and use either half-filled slots or overhanging <b>coil</b> <b>sides</b> {{at the ends}} of the machine. Long stator systems are difficult since {{it is not possible to}} butt stator modules against each other. Arguably the simplest and most cost effective winding uses modular construction where the coils are planar and do not overlap. Here the end winding is compact and stator sections can be butted together. However modular windings do not produce high quality travelling fields. Two space harmonics of closely the same magnitude are produced that travel in opposite directions, giving induced currents and opposing forces with little net force in plate rotors. The difficulty can be resolved if a wound secondary with a double layer winding is used instead of a plate. Here a substantial induced emf and current is produced only by the field for which the secondary is wound, so that force is produced only in one direction. The use and properties of modular windings for short rotor machines are explored using finite element analysis and the results are validated by practical tests. It is concluded that inexpensive modular windings can be used with wound secondaries to good effect particularly in long stator situations; for example, for electromagnetic launch and urban transport systems...|$|R
