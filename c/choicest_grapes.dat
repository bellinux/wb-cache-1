One of the reasons for the prevalence of sweet kosher wine in the U.S., and in the Americas generally, dates back to the early days of Jews in America, when there was the need to locally produce kosher wine for the Kiddush ritual on the Shabbat and holidays. The combination of a limited <b>choice</b> of <b>grape</b> varieties that could grow in the areas where Jews had settled, along with limited time available to produce the wine and a market dominated by hard cider, yielded a bitter wine that had to be sweetened to make it palatable.|$|R

When incentivized choices are public, incentivizing all children to pick grapes has no statistically significant effect on take-up, as the negative spillover offsets the positive impacts of incentives on take-up...|$|R
40|$|Proposals {{for reform}} of the federal multiple-peril crop {{insurance}} program for specialty crops seek to change fees for catastrophic (CAT) insurance from a nominal fifty-dollar per contract registration fee to an actuarially sound premium. Growers argue that this would cause {{a significant reduction in}} participation rates, thus impeding the program's goals of eventually obviating the need for ad hoc disaster payments and worsening the actuarial soundness of the program. The key policy issue is, therefore, empirical one - whether the demand for specialty crop insurance is elastic or inelastic. Previous studies of this issue using either grower or county-level field crop data typically treat the participation problem as either a discrete insure / don't insure decision or aggregate these decisions to a continuous participation rate problem. However, a grower's problem is more realistically cast as one of simultaneously making a coverage level / insurance participation decision. Because the issue at hand considers a significant price increase for only one coverage level (50 %), differentiating between these decisions is necessary both from an analytical and econometric standpoint. To model this decision, the paper develops a two-stage estimation procedure based on Lee's multinomial logit-OLS selection framework. This method is applied to a county-level panel data set consisting of eleven years of the eleven largest grape-growing counties in California. Results show that growers choose among coverage levels based upon expected net premiums and the variance of these returns, as well as the first two moments of expected market returns. At the participation-level, the mean and variance of indemnities are also important, as are several variables measuring the extent of self-insurance, such as farm size, enterprise diversity, or farm income. The results also show that the elasticity of 50 % coverage insurance is elastic, suggesting that premium increases may indeed worsen the actuarial soundness of the program. These increases will also cause a significant adjustment of growers among coverage levels.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} imperfectly {{informed}} consumers use simple signals to identify characteristics in wine. The denomination and vintage of a wine {{as well as}} the specific characteristics of a particular wine will be used. However, the specific characteristics of a wine are difficult to ascertain ex ante given the enormous product variety. The reputation of a denomination will thus be an important guide for consumers. Reputation is a function of average quality as revealed by past performance of producers in a specific geographically defined denomination. The impact of past performance increases over time, since producers associate improved average quality as an important factor in enhancing the price, but this necessitates monitoring of members in the denomination. The market and pricing of Tuscan red wines provide a natural experiment because {{there are a number of}} denominations of different age, each of which is typically undergoing a process of gradual increase in quality standards over time. Furthermore Tuscan red wines are easily comparable because of great similarities in climate and <b>choice</b> of <b>grape</b> varieties, soil and exposure to sun etc. We show that new denominations have a lower average quality score and that price differentials between denominations roughly correspond to differences in average quality, althoug...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to identify and discriminate eleven native Romanian grapevine varieties with the goal to obtain a genotype-specific profile by using microsatellites, the undisputed markers of <b>choice</b> for <b>grape</b> identification and parentage analysis (Sefc et al. 2001). All the primers paires yielded clear and scorable amplified products and proved to be multi-allelic. The total number of different alleles per locus ranged from 4 (in VVMD 24 and VVIQ 52) to 10 (in VMC 8 G 9, UDV 125 and VMC 5 G 6. 1) with a total of 87 alleles considering all loci and a mean value of 7. 9 alleles per locus. The microsatellite profile of the investigated cultivars showed a high level of genetic diversity among their flanking regions and all cultivars were found to have an unique allelic profile. The number of alleles detected with Romanian grapevine genotipes was very similar to those obtained with SSR microsatellites on European cultivars (Sefc et al., 2000). The expected heterozygosity (gene diversity) values were high for all DNA samples ranging from 0. 60 at locus VVMD 24 to 0. 88 at locu...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MAgricAdmin (Agricultural Economics)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The wine {{industry}} {{is one of}} the oldest commercial activities in South Africa. The South African wine grape industry annually produces more than a million tonnes of grapes, making the country the ninth largest producer in the world. The total area under wine grape production is divided into eight regions for administrative purposes. These boundaries are a legacy of the era of controlled marketing and there is continued meaningfulness of having various classifications such as ‘wine of origin’ scheme. The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that determine the producers’ <b>choice</b> of wine <b>grape</b> cultivars in the wine regions in South Africa. Time series data for the period 1990 - 2003 were used to estimate the parameters of linear regression models. Two equations for each wine grape cultivar in each region were postulated and estimated using Ordinary Least Squares as applied with Eviews. Further, a stepwise regression as applied in STATISTICA was used to eliminate the parameters that were not statistically significant at five percent significant level. In identifying the factors that determine the <b>choice</b> of wine <b>grape</b> cultivars in the regions, the results showed that each wine grape cultivar in each region has its own factors influencing the producers’ choice of that specific wine grape cultivar. Same wine grape cultivars in different regions similarly have its own factors determining the producers’ choice. The implication of this is that there are differences in terms of the requirements and types of crops and wine grape cultivars grown in each region. However, the most important result that emerged with regular frequency is that, the factors determining the producers’ choice of a specific wine grape cultivar for each region is price of other wine grape cultivars and competitive products in that wine region. The price of specific wine grape cultivars only had an influence on few wine grape cultivars. The implication is that the producers in South Africa appears to consider the prices of other wine grape cultivars and competitive products before making a choice of whether to plant or uproot a specific wine grape cultivar more than the price of the specific wine grape cultivar. This supports the theory that farm prices play a key role in allocating resources and in rewarding efficient producers...|$|R
40|$|AustraliaÂ‘s export-led {{growth in}} demand for {{commercial}} bottled wine was {{based in part on}} producer freedom (relative to Europeans) to blend wines across the full range of varieties and geographic regions, so as to be able to reproduce year after year a consistent style for each label. Over time, however, that has led some buyers in the Old WorldÂ‘ to believe Australian wine makers do not respect or exploit regional differences in terroir or, worse still, that Australia is incapable of making high-quality, regionally distinct wines. This paper examines empirically the changing extent to which Australian wine regions do in fact vary in their <b>choice</b> of wine <b>grape</b> varieties and in the average quality of those wine grapes. Its new new quantitative indexes may also provide a base for simulating the potential impacts on different regions of climate change and of adaptive responses to it.

40|$|Melatonin {{presence}} in higher plants was recently discovered {{and the knowledge}} of its function in vivo is limited. Several studies have recently shown the occurrence of melatonin and related compounds in grapes and wines. The analysis of melatonin in plants and foods represents a highly challenging task due to its wide concentration range, the difficulty {{in the selection of}} the extraction solvents because of its amphipathic nature, {{and the fact that it}} reacts quickly with other matrix components. Thus, sample processing factors, preparation/cleanup procedures and chromatographic/detection parameters such as HILIC and reverse phase (C 8 and C 18) chromatographic modes, electrospray ionization and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization in both negative and positive modes were evaluated. Taken together, we have demonstrated that optimal conditions were quite different for each of the matrices under study. A sonication mediated- extraction step was necessary for grape skin (100 % v/v methanol) and plant tissues (50 % v/v methanol), while wine and must required a solid phase extraction preconcentration step. HILIC chromatography-(+) APCI ionization was better for melatonin standards, while C 8 -(+) APCI was the best <b>choice</b> for <b>grape</b> skin and C 18 -(+ESI) was suitable for wine. On the other hand, C 8 -(+) ESI was the most appropriate for vegetal tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana. Proposed methods were validated, the limits of detection were in the low picograms levels range. The optimized approaches were applied to the determination of melatonin and its isomer in different vegetal/food samples; levels found within the range: 4. 9 ? 440 ng g− 1.
