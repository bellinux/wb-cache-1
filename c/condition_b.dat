5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict {{bleeding}} in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding <b>condition</b> (<b>B),</b> previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E

XII. § 11, by the mere {{breaking of the}} edges of solid beds of coherent rock, there occurs almost always a condition of mountain summit, intermediate in aspect, as in position. The aiguille may generally be represented by the type a, Fig. 42; the solid and simple beds of rock by the type c. The <b>condition</b> <b>b,</b> clearly intermediate between the two, is, on the whole, the most graceful and perfect in which mountain masses occur. It seems to have attracted more of {{the attention of the}} poets than either of the others; and the ordinary word, crest, which we carelessly use in speaking of mountain summits, as if it meant little more than [...] "edge" [...] or [...] "ridge," [...] has a peculiar force and propriety when applied to ranges of cliff whose contours correspond thus closely to the principal lines of the crest of a Greek helmet.|$|E

50|$|The {{presence}} of gas around a specimen creates new possibilities unique to ESEM: (a) Liquid-phase electron microscopy is possible since any pressure greater than 609 Pa allows water {{to be maintained}} in its liquid phase for temperatures above 0 °C, {{in contrast to the}} SEM where specimens are desiccated by the vacuum <b>condition.</b> (<b>b)</b> Electrically non-conductive specimens do not require the preparation techniques used in SEM to render the surface conductive, such as the deposition of a thin gold or carbon coating, or other treatments, techniques which also require vacuum in the process. Insulating specimens charge up by the electron beam making imaging problematic or even impossible. (c) The gas itself is used as a detection medium producing novel imaging possibilities, as opposed to vacuum SEM detectors. (d) Plain plastic scintillating BSE detectors can operate uncoated without charging. Hence, these detectors produce the highest possible signal-to-noise-ratio at the lowest possible accelerating voltage, because the BSE do not dissipate any energy in an aluminium coating used for the vacuum SEM.|$|E

5000|$|A {{shifting}} {{executory interest}} cuts short {{someone other than}} the grantor. For example, if O conveys property [...] "To A, but if B returns from Florida within the next year, to B"; here, B has a shifting executory interest, and A has a fee simple subject to this shifting executory interest. A shifting executory interest may be premised on any event, irrespective of whether that event is {{under the control of}} one party or the other, or if it is an external event under the control of neither party. For example, a conveyance [...] "To A, but if the property is ever used as a commercial dairy, to B" [...] would leave A in control of the condition; so long as A does not use the property in the proscribed manner it will remain hers. Conversely, a conveyance [...] "To A, but if B receives a law degree, to B" [...] places B entirely in control of the dispensation of the property; if B is able to fulfill the <b>condition,</b> <b>B</b> will get the property irrespective of what A does. Finally, the interest may shift based on a wholly external event, for example, [...] "To A, but if the Cleveland Browns win the Superbowl, to B".|$|E
5000|$|There {{has been}} much {{discussion}} in linguistic literature {{on the type of}} approach that would best account for logophoricity. Syntactic accounts have been attempted within the context of Government and binding theory [...] More specifically, Binding Theory organizes nominal expressions into three groups: (i) anaphors, (ii) pronominals, and (iii) R-expressions. The distribution and grammaticality of these are governed by Conditions A, B, and C (Sportiche, et al., 2014):Anaphors are not referential in and of themselves; they must be co-indexed to an antecedent. Problems arise when the antecedent falls outside the anaphor's local domain, occurring inside the same sentence or even in a previous one. [...] argues that logophors therefore form a special class of anaphors that may be linked to a referent outside their projected domain, categorizing them as a particular subset of anaphora that refer to the [...] "source of a discourse" [...] - i.e., the original (secondary) speaker, not the messenger relaying the information. Alternatively, [...] contends that logophors are not anaphors at all, as they violate Condition A of Binding Theory with their lack of a c-commanding relationship to the antecedent. In relation to this, logophors and long-distance reflexives can be found in overlapping contexts with non-logophoric personal pronouns; they are not in complementary distribution with pronouns as anaphors are. Logophors also fail to satisfy <b>Condition</b> <b>B,</b> as they necessarily have antecedents and so are not referentially free within their domain - thus, they are not true pronominals, based on this condition.|$|E
