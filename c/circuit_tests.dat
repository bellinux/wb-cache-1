Subsequent investigations, including a National Geographic Channel documentary, revealed that this FDR had previously failed, for periods lasting between ten seconds and ten minutes.

50|$|Shields {{on power}} cables may be {{connected}} to earth ground at each shield end and at splices for redundancy to prevent shock even though induced current will flow in the shield. This current will produce losses and heating and will reduce the maximum current rating of the <b>circuit.</b> <b>Tests</b> show that having a bare grounding conductor adjacent to the insulated wires will conduct the fault current to earth more quickly. On high-current circuits the shields might be connected only at one end. On very long high-voltage circuits, the shield may be broken into several sections since a long shield run may rise to dangerous voltages during a circuit fault. There is a risk of shock hazard from having only {{one end of the}} shield grounded. The maximum recommended shield potential rise is 25 volts. IEEE 422 and 525 lists the cable lengths that would limit shield potential to 25 volts for a single point ground application.|$|E
40|$|Digital <b>circuit</b> <b>testing</b> is {{presented}} in this thesis. This thesis introduces an architecture that accelerates benchmarked <b>circuit</b> <b>testing.</b> Traditionally, benchmark <b>circuits</b> are <b>tested</b> on software, because of the complexity in developing a generic hardware architecture capable of testing sequentially or concurrently. The testing is based on Built-in Self-Test (BIST) techniques. The <b>circuit</b> <b>testing</b> is accomplished by two hardware implementations, aimed at increasing execution time with respect to its counterpart, software. The implementation realized and executed in hardware, illustrates the advantages of utilizing hardware platforms for digital <b>circuit</b> <b>testing</b> and it gives a path to developing more complex benchmarked circuits; which would have higher fault coverage. The novel architecture is targeted for digital <b>circuit</b> <b>testing</b> and adaptive embedded system applications. These applications vary in their constraints (i. e. hard and soft real-time constraints) and environmental conditions (i. e. unknown and unpredictable). The novel architecture consists of a fixed hardware unit and a Reconfigurable Processor Unit (RPU). The RPU employs hardware functional blocks. These Hardware Blocks (HB) encompass logic that targets their respective applications. We realize and implement HBs that target digital <b>circuit</b> <b>testing</b> applications, by means of BIST techniques. Experimental results are presented in this thesis.

40|$|The {{conventional}} approach, widely {{practiced in}} the industry today, for <b>testing</b> analog <b>circuits</b> is by ensuring the circuit conforms to data-sheet limits on all its specifications. However, such a specification based test methodology suffers from high levels of test cost stemming from long test-times on expensive test equipment. In recent years the situation has only worsened {{with the advent of}} mixed signal systems on chip (SoC), to a point where analog <b>circuit</b> <b>test</b> cost {{has been found to be}} as much as 50 % of the total test cost in spite of analog portions occupying less than 5 % of the chip area.
