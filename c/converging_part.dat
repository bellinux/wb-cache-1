The nozzle {{is assumed to be}} symmetric in the diverging (or <b>converging)</b> <b>part.</b> If the supersonic incoming flow is symmetric near the divergent (or convergent) part of the nozzle, then, as indicated in Section 147 of [R. Courant, K. O. Friedrichs, Supersonic Flow and Shock Waves, Interscience Publ., New York, 1948], there exist two constant pressures P 1 and P 2 with P 1 <P 2 such that for given constant exit pressure Pe∈(P 1,P 2), a symmetric transonic shock exists uniquely in the nozzle, and the position and the strength of the shock are completely determined by Pe. Moreover, it is shown in this paper that such a transonic shock solution is unique under the restriction that the shock goes through the fixed point at the wall in the multidimensional setting. Furthermore, we establish the global existence, stability and the long time asymptotic behavior of an unsteady symmetric transonic shock under the exit pressure Pe when the initial unsteady shock lies in the symmetric diverging part of the 2 -D or 3 -D nozzle. On the other hand, it is shown that an unsteady symmetric transonic shock is structurally unstable in a global-in-time sense if it lies in the symmetric <b>converging</b> <b>part</b> of the nozzle...|$|E

40|$|The {{apparent}} viscosity of dilute polymer solutions in non-inertial flows through channels consisting of successive short tubes or slits separated by expansions displays a marked divergence from shear-thinning power-law behaviour beyond a critical shear rate calculated for constricted sections. The product of this critical shear rate by the Rouse relaxation time {{was found to}} be nearly constant for various coil polymers, solvent viscosities and polymer concentrations, independently of the exact geometric shape of the channels. When the critical shear rate is reached, the maximum stretch rate in the converging sections is greater than the inverse of the Rouse relaxation time.

40|$|The {{recently}} discovered gamma-ray flares from the Crab nebula are generally {{attributed to the}} magnetic energy release in a highly magnetized region within the nebula. I argue that such a region naturally arises in the polar region of the inner nebula. In pulsar winds, efficient dissipation of the Poynting flux into the plasma energy occur only in the equatorial belt where the energy is predominantly transferred by alternating fields. At high latitudes, the pulsar wind remains highly magnetized therefore the termination shock in the polar region is weak and the postshock flow remains relativistic. I study the structure of this flow and show that the flow at first expands and decelerates and then it converges and accelerates. In the <b>converging</b> <b>part</b> of the flow, the kink instability triggers the magnetic dissipation. The energy release zone occurs {{at the base of}} the observed jet. A specific turbulence of relativistically shrinking magnetic loops efficiently accelerates particles so that the synchrotron emission in the hundreds MeV band, both persistent and flaring, comes from this site.

40|$|We {{ask whether}} Poland {{is at risk}} of the boom-bust problem that has afflicted economies {{around the time of}} euro adoption. Our answer, inevitably, is mixed. On the one hand the fact that Poland is an outlier, credit-growth wise, accentuates the danger of a boom if one {{believes}} in mean reversion. Our econometrics indicate that the fall in interest rates that will flow from expectations of euro adoption will further feed that boom. On the other hand the fact that interest rates have already <b>converged</b> <b>part</b> way to euro-area levels (and more extensively than in earlier adopters that experienced a sharp fall in rates and a pronounced credit boom), {{especially in the case of}} lending to firms, suggests that this shock may be less intense in Poland. And it is certainly conceivable that the same policies and country characteristics (not always visible to the econometrician) that have restrained credit growth in the past may continue to do so in the future. The broader literature also points to two set of factors, the first of which makes the danger of an unsustainable credit boom more immediate, the second of which makes it more remote. In the first category are the continuing limitations of the supervisory framework and the weakness of the finance minister in the budget-making process.

The notion of compressibility is also extended to infinite sequences of i. i. d. or ergodic random variables based on the observed error in their nonlinear k-term approximation. In this work, we use the entropy measure to study the compressibility of continuous-domain innovation processes (alternatively known as white noise). Specifically, we define such a measure as the entropy limit of the doubly quantized (time and amplitude) process by identifying divergent terms and extracting the convergent part. While the <b>converging</b> <b>part</b> determines the introduced entropy, the diverging terms provide a tool to compare the compressibility of various innovation processes. In particular, we study stable, and impulsive Poisson innovation processes representing various type of distributions. Our results recognize Poisson innovations as the most compressible one with an entropy measure far below that of stable innovations. While this result departs from the previous knowledge regarding the compressibility of fat-tailed distributions, our entropy measure ranks stable innovations according to their tail decay.

40|$|A Vapour Jet Refrigeration System (VJRS) is an {{alternative}} to the conventional mechanically driven vapour-compression refrigeration system. The VJRS utilises a supersonic ejector as a thermal compressor and has the potential significantly to reduce energy consumption in air conditioning systems. Experimental investigations and analysis of large supersonic jet ejectors such as those used for steam jet refrigeration, has been carried out in past literature. In the present study the performance characteristics of small VJRS ejectors using R 12 as the working fluid (ie ejectors with throat diameters of several millimetres only) have been investigated using experimental, analytical and C F D (computational fluid dynamics) techniques. In practice ejector performance may be affected by the choking phenomena in the secondary stream, superheating of vapour leaving the evaporator and generator, nozzle and diffuser efficiency. The present author developed a model for a small, single-fluid VJRS ejector using the theory of secondary vapour choking which was introduced by Munday and Bagster (1977). This theory was employed by the present researcher to design and test a small R 12 ejector. Results of a computer simulation that models secondary choking in the <b>converging</b> <b>part</b> of the ejector and the effects of superheat conditions on the ejector performance are presented. In the present work further developed has been carried out to examine the optimum nozzle position when the ejectors operated at fully developed choked conditions. It has been confirmed that for the small ejectors the choking phenomenon {{plays an important role in}} ejector performance. It was also recognised that the nozzle position is a very important factor of the ejector geometry for small VJRS ejectors. In the secondary choking theory, ejector performance may be taken to be a function of the 2 ̆ 2 effective area 2 ̆ 2 available to the secondary fluid within the mixing chamber of the ejector. The present study involved experimental investigation of how this effective area is influenced by operating conditions such as evaporator temperature and nozzle position. In the present investigation the geometry of the <b>converging</b> <b>part</b> of the ejector has also been studied and the shock pressure recovery process examined in the constant area mixing tube.

By creating texture or micro dimple on a hydrodynamic journal bearing, pressure increases and significant improvement has been achieved in its load carrying capacity, lubricant flow rate, coefficient of friction etc. In a present work numerical analysis has been carried out to determine the effect of using negative spherical surface texture on hydrodynamic journal bearing surface and it is compared with normal journal bearing i. e. journal bearing without texture.

40|$|International audienceWhen a {{shock wave}} crosses an {{interface}} between two materials, this interface becomes unstable and the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability develops. Such instability {{has been extensively}} studied in the planar case, and numerous results were presented during the previous workshops. But the Richtmyer-Meshkov (Richtmyer, 1960, ``Taylor Instability in Shock Acceleration of Compressible Fluids,'' Commun. Pure Appl. Math., 13 (2), pp. 297 - 319; Meshkov, 1969, ``Interface of Two Gases Accelerated by a Shock Wave,''Fluid Dyn., 4 (5), pp. 101 - 104) instability also occurs in a spherical case where the convergence effects {{must be taken into}} account. As far as we know, no conventional (straight section) shock tube facility has been used to experimentally study the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability in spherical geometry. The idea originally proposed by Dimotakis and Samtaney (2006,'' Planar Shock Cylindrical Focusing by a Perfect-Gas Lens,'' Phys. Fluid., 18 (3), pp. 031705 - 031708) and later generalized by Vandenboomgaerde and Aymard (2011, ``Analytical Theory for Planar Shock Focusing Through Perfect Gas Lens and Shock Tube Experiment Designs,'' Phys. Fluid., 23 (1), pp. 016101 - 016113) was to retain the flexibility of a conventional shock tube to convert a planar shock wave into a cylindrical one through a perfect gas lens. This can be done when a planar shock wave passes through a shaped interface between two gases. By coupling the shape with the impedance mismatch at the interface, it is possible to generate a circular transmitted shock wave. In order to experimentally check the feasibility of this approach, we have implemented the gas lens technique on a conventional shock tube {{with the help of a}} convergent test section, an elliptic stereolithographed grid, and a nitrocellulose membrane. First experimental sequences of schlieren images have been obtained for an incident shock wave Mach number equal to 1. 15 and an air/SF 6 -shaped interface.

Gene expression-based prognostic signatures offer promise, but studies have been challenged by sample scarcity, cohort heterogeneity, and doubts about the efficacy of such signatures relative to current clinical practices. Motivated by new studies that have begun to address these challenges, we reviewed prognostic signatures derived from gene expression microarray analysis of human melanoma tissue.

Through functional ontology enrichment analysis, we observed that these independent data sets <b>converge</b> in <b>part</b> upon immune response processes and the G-protein signaling NRAS-regulation pathway, both important in melanoma development and progression.

40|$|Advances in investigative {{techniques}} {{have led to}} an increasing awareness {{and understanding of the}} role of central neural control in the autonomic nervous system regulation of the heart. Substantial evidence exists for a role of the higher centres in neuro-cardiac control including the effect of focal brain stimulation and acute brain lesions on cardiac electrophysiology, blood pressure, contractile function and the development of arrhythmias. Mental stress and strong emotions have long been associatedwith sudden cardiac death. There is an emerging literature relating the gene-environment interactions in determining the neural patterning responsible for the stress response itself. The role of the higher brain centres in determining myocardial behaviour has become accessible through the utilisation of optogenetic techniques to modulate activity in specific brainstem nuclei, enabling the dissection of specific vagal and sympathetic inputs on cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis. Central cardiac control mechanisms are modulated by afferent signals from the heart.
