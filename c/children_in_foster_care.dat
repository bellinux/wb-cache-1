In 1863 the Territory came under the control of South Australia which in 1910 passed the Northern Territory Aboriginals Act 1910. The Act claimed to be for the [...] "Protection and Control" [...] of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of the Territory. Under the Act, the [...] "Chief Protector of Aboriginals" [...] was appointed as the legal guardian of every child whose mother was Aboriginal, and had the power to confine such children to a reserve or Aboriginal institution. That is, indigenous children could be removed by Administrative order, whereas non-Indigenous children at the time could only be removed by order of a Court. This policy of removing indigenous children from their family continued when control of the Northern Territory was transferred from South Australia to the federal government. The Aboriginals Ordinance 1918 extended these powers, putting Aboriginal females under the total control of the Chief Protector. [...] Most of the Aboriginal institutions were operated by operated by churches. From 1964 indigenous children could only be removed under the same circumstances as non-Indigenous children, however, the conditions of life for Indigenous people put them at greater risk of having their children removed on the ground of neglect or destitution.

This is over {{twice as many as}} the 20,529 foster children in New York, the state with the second largest population of foster youth, had by the end of 2012. Over 30 percent of California foster youth reside in Los Angeles County, amounting to 18,523 children. Children can be removed from their homes and placed into the foster care system for a variety of reasons, but, in California, 81.2 percent of children were removed because of neglect. Even after being placed in the foster care system, however, these children might not find the kind of care or stability they need. Girls in foster care have been shown to have marginally higher rates of teenage pregnancy than the general population of California. <b>Children</b> <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> also have to face disproportionately high rates of mental illnesses as some studies have shown that as much as 47.9 percent of foster care youth showed signs of serious emotional or behavioral issues. After [...] "aging out" [...] of the system at age 18, research has shown that previous foster youth still face difficult instability in their lives. As much as 30 percent of previous foster children are diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Only about 50 percent graduate from high school and less than 10 percent graduate from college. A study focused on foster care alumni in Los Angeles County showed that about 65 percent leave foster care without a place to live and 25 percent are incarcerated by age 20. Despite these difficulties, California is working toward easing the transition for foster youth through programs and legislation like the California Fostering Connections to Success Act of 2010, which expanded upon similar federal legislation and increased the age limit for receiving foster care benefits.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{is developing}} {{on the theme}} of Motivation of the parents to admit a <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> <b>care.</b> <b>Foster</b> <b>care</b> is a state-guaranteed form of <b>foster</b> <b>care.</b> Children that are suitable for <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> are not legally free. <b>Foster</b> <b>care</b> is always created by a court decision, which also can be canceled for serious reason by the court. <b>Foster</b> <b>care</b> expires at the day of legal age of the child. If the child is still preparing for their future career, <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> last until age 26. In the first chapter of the bachelor thesis I deal with the family. The following chapters will focus on <b>foster</b> <b>care,</b> where I deal with different types of <b>foster</b> <b>care.</b> <b>In</b> one of the chapters I deal with the specifications of <b>foster</b> <b>care.</b> <b>In</b> the next charter I deal with intermediation of <b>foster</b> <b>care.</b> Then I mention motives reported in the literature. These are the motives of public, private and hidden. At the end of the theoretical part I deal with the support of <b>foster</b> <b>care.</b> For the practical part of the bachelor I chose a qualitative research method of half-structured interviews. Data collection I conducted with foster parents, who came from the city Most. I did an interview together with five foster parents. The interview consisted of nine themes, which contained several questions. The main goal of these interviews was to identify the motives leading to admit a <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> <b>care.</b> The operational goal was to find out what are the advantages and pitfalls provide <b>foster</b> <b>care.</b> To achieve these goals, I have chosen the following research questions: 1. What is the motivation of parents to admit a <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> <b>care.</b> The respondents' answers to this research question differed. Two of the five foster parents reported that the main motivation which leads them to become foster parents, was to help own family. Another motivation was the inability of the married couple to have their own children and thats why they decided to become foster parents. The motivation for the next married couple was overcoming the marriage crisis. One of the families reported that their main motivation was to help a child who has been abandoned and needed help. By respondents answers, motives can be devided into public, private and hidden. As a public motive may be indicated inability to have their own child for health reasons and that is infertility. As next public motive was reported help to the child. As privat motives two respondents answered mainly the help to their families. These are the foster parents of the children who started to focus mainly on the basis of kinship. As hidden motive was to overcome marital crisis. As another hidden motive we can deduce financial support that respondents mentioned in the first line. Among the motive which comes from the unconscious, we can classify an attempt to atone for the bad manners of their children. Results of the research show that the motives that lead foster parents become foster parents are different. The motivation of applicants very important, because it derives from the whole approach to fostering. Foster parents should go mainly for the welfare of the child. 2. What are the advantages and pitfalls provided <b>foster</b> <b>care.</b> The main problem foster parents have {{seen in a long time}} dealing with all formalities. Also coincided with the fact that the <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> is relatively little awareness. As an additional obstacle sees establish an emotional relationship to foster parents, which may be interrupted. Respondents positively evaluated help a crisis centre or support from the state. The research shows that the biggest help that foster families appreciate is mainly financial help from the state. This bachelor thesis may serve other students as a source of information. The work can be used as a literature data for people interested <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> because it contains opinions and motivations to admit a <b>child</b> <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> <b>care...</b>|$|R
