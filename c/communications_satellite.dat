The satellite's destruction temporarily disables a Federation {{base on the}} planet, allowing the resistance to successfully attack it and destroy numerous droids and heavy equipment. During the fight, Sykes commandeers a Federation gunboat and uses it to liberate labor camps along the Andrevea River, escorting the freed prisoners to a rendezvous point among ruins to the north.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, the Governor of Massachusetts, Endicott Peabody, {{appointed}} McCormack as Chairman of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. In October 1965, he {{was appointed}} chairman of the <b>Communications</b> <b>Satellite</b> Corporation (COMSAT), with a $125,000 salary. To allow himself to concentrate on his new position, he resigned all his company directorships, along with his post at MIT. He attended his first board meeting in Washington, DC, in his dinner jacket, having flown from Los Angeles after a speaking engagement. As head of a quasi-government organization, McCormack strove to employ the company's resources {{to carry out the}} policies of Congress and the President, and was able to persuade Congress to declassify plans for a domestic satellite network so he could consult with the television networks. He retired as chairman due to ill health in 1970, although he remained a director.|$|E
5|$|Records {{of signals}} sent between the {{aircraft}} and a <b>communications</b> <b>satellite</b> over the Indian Ocean {{revealed that the}} aircraft had continued flying for almost six hours after its final sighting on Malaysian military radar. Initial analysis of these communications determined that Flight 370 was along one of two arcs—equidistant from the satellite—when its last signal was sent; the same day this analysis was publicly disclosed, 15 March, authorities announced they would abandon search efforts in the South China Sea, Gulf of Thailand, and Strait of Malacca to focus their efforts on the two corridors. The northern arc—from northern Thailand to Kazakhstan—was soon discounted as the aircraft {{would have had to}} pass through heavily militarised airspace and those countries claimed their military radar would have detected an unidentified aircraft entering their airspace.|$|E

Turkish Satellite Assembly, Integration and Test Center (UMET) is a spacecraft production and testing facility owned by the Ministry of National Defence and operated by the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI). The Turkish Space Launch System (UFS) is a project to develop the satellite launch capability of Turkey. It consists of the construction of a spaceport, the development of satellite launch vehicles as well as the establishment of remote earth stations. Türksat is the sole <b>communications</b> <b>satellite</b> operator in Turkey and has launched the Türksat series of satellites into orbit. Göktürk-1 and Göktürk-2 are Turkey's earth observation satellites for reconnaissance, operated by the Ministry of National Defence.

JCSAT-1, the first commercial Japanese <b>communications</b> <b>satellite,</b> was successfully launched aboard an Ariane-44LP on March 6, 1989.

25|$|A <b>communications</b> <b>satellite</b> is an {{artificial}} satellite stationed in {{space for the}} purposes of telecommunications. Modern communications satellites use a variety of orbits. For fixed point-to-point services, communications satellites provide a microwave radio relay technology complementary to that of submarine communication cables. Invented in 1962 by the American aerospace engineer John Robinson Pierce, NASA launched Telstar, the world's first active <b>communications</b> <b>satellite,</b> and the first satellite designed to transmit telephone and high-speed data communications. Its name is still used to this day for a number of television broadcasting satellites.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{energy is}} often used to supply power for {{satellites}} and spacecraft operating in the inner solar system since it can supply energy for a long time without excess fuel mass. A <b>Communications</b> <b>satellite</b> contains multiple radio transmitters which operate continually during its life. It would be uneconomic to operate such a vehicle (which may be on-orbit for years) from primary batteries or fuel cells, and refuelling in orbit is not practical. Solar power is not generally used to adjust the satellite's position, however, and the useful life of a <b>communications</b> <b>satellite</b> will be limited by the on-board station-keeping fuel supply.|$|E
