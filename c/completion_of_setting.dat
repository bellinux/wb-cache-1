40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{impression}} technique is to overcome the problem associated with restricted mouth opening in association with high arched palate by employing pneumatic impression technique using latex balloon. Methods: A stock tray was modified with auto polymerizing acrylic resin. On the modified tray, a latex balloon was attached with aid of cyanoacrylate. The outlet of the balloon was then connected to a clinical sphygmomanometer bulb with the rubber pipe for air passage which would aid in inflating the balloon. The prepared tray assembly was then equipped for recording the impression. An adequate amount of addition polysiloxane impression material, sufficient to cover the entire area of the balloon was loaded onto the tray. The balloon was then inflated {{with the help of}} a sphygmomanometer bulb which transferred the air only in one direction. On <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> time of the impression material, the air pressure was relieved by deflating of balloon which helped in the easy removal of the impression. The impression was subsequently removed from the oral cavity and disinfected. Conclusion: This novel technique was helpful for recording impression in patients presenting with restricted mouth opening and high arched palate...|$|E
30|$|The {{surgical}} technique of extensive curettage was contemplated by entering {{either from the}} limiting cortex or the side of erosion, as appreciated on a radiograph and then gradually enlarging the entry to a wide cortical window that provides visualization of the entire tumor cavity and permits digital palpation of the inner tumor walls. If extension of the tumor into the soft tissues was seen, the entire pseudo-capsule was dissected circumferentially and excised completely. The intraosseous tumor bulk was scooped out completely with a large curette until smooth cortical bony surface with punctate bleeding was visible, ensuring the undersurface of window. Meticulous care was taken {{to ensure that all}} the involved bone and the possible contaminated surrounding soft tissue was excised. The curetted material was re-sent for histopathological examination. A high-speed power burr was used in all cases. Following thorough curettage, the resulting cavity was irrigated with hydrogen peroxide in all cases and phenol-dipped gauze was scraped along the cavity wall in 17 cases, followed by normal saline irrigation. The cavity was then dried and completely filled with the prepared cement mass using thumb pressure, pushing the cement into every part of the cavity. Internal fixation was used in only one patient with a lesion in the proximal femur associated with a femoral neck fracture, where titanium cannulated cancellous screws were used for fixation before cementation. Following hardening of the cement and <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> time, the extra cement was removed using a rongeur or an osteotome. Hemostasis was achieved and closure in layers was performed without a negative suction drain.|$|E

40|$|In atraumatic {{restorative}} treatment (ART), caries removal {{with hand}} excavation instruments {{is not as}} efficient as that with rotary burs in eliminating bacteria under the glass ionomer cements (GICs). Thus, different antibacterial agents {{have been used in}} recent studies to enhance the antibacterial properties of the GICs, without jeopardizing their basic physical properties. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of antibacterial agents on the surface hardness of a conventional GIC (Fuji IX) using Vickers microhardness [Vickers hardness number (VHN) ] test. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cetrimide (CT), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and chlorhexidine (CHX) were added to the powder and benzalkonium chloride (BC) was added to the liquid of Fuji IX in concentrations of 1 % and 2 %, and served as the experimental groups. A control group containing no additive was also prepared. After the <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> reaction, VHN measurements were recorded at 1, 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days after storage in 37 °C distilled water. A one-way ANOVA was performed followed by a Dunnett t test and Tamhane T 2 tests and also repeated measurements ANOVA was used for multiple comparisons in 95 % confidence interval. RESULTS: VHN results showed significant differences between the control and the experimental groups at all time periods (p< 0. 05 for all). Significant differences were observed between all study periods for individual groups (p< 0. 05). After 7 days, VHNs were decreased in all experimental groups while they continued to increase in the control group. BC and CHX groups demonstrated the least whereas CT and CPC groups exhibited most adverse effect on the hardness of set cements. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the decreased microhardness values in all experimental groups compared to the controls after 7 up to 90 days, incorporating certain antibacterial agents into Fuji IX GIC showed tolerable microhardness alterations within the limitations of this in vitro study...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the acute change of static stretching (SS) on autonomic nerve activity and to clarify the effect of SS on systemic circulation. Twenty healthy young, male volunteers performed a 1 -min SS motion of the right triceps surae muscle, repeated five times. The autonomic nerve activity balance was obtained using second derivatives of the photoplethysmogram readings before (pre), during, and after (post) SS. Heart rate and blood pressure (BP) were also measured. The autonomic nerve activity significantly changed to parasympathetic dominance by SS as compared with pre. In addition, for SS, the autonomic nerve activity slowly changed to sympathetic dominance after <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> all <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> stretching, but these value {{did not return to}} pre during the 5 minutes after the <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> all <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> stretching, with parasympathetic dominance continuing by 4 minutes after SS.

40|$|Inspired by "Google Sets", we {{consider}} the problem of retrieving items from a concept or cluster, given a query consisting of a few items from that cluster. We formulate this as a Bayesian inference problem and describe a very simple algorithm for solving it. Our algorithm uses a modelbased concept of a cluster and ranks items using a score which evaluates the marginal probability that each item belongs to a cluster containing the query items. For exponential family models with conjugate priors this marginal probability is a simple function of sufficient statistics. We focus on sparse binary data and show that our score can be evaluated exactly using a single sparse matrix multiplication, {{making it possible to}} apply our algorithm to very large datasets. We evaluate our algorithm on three datasets: retrieving movies from EachMovie, finding <b>completions</b> <b>of</b> author <b>sets</b> from the NIPS dataset, and finding <b>completions</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> words appearing in the Grolier encyclopedia.

40|$|SLG {{evaluation}} {{has received}} attention {{not only because}} of its theoretical properties [...] - it computes well-founded and three-valued stable models for general logic programs [...] - but also because it can be efficiently implemented. The SLG-WAM of XSB has proven an order of magnitude or more faster than similar systems when executing modularly stratified programs. This paper proposes an operational semantics, SLGO, which bridges a gap between the general description of SLG in [2] and the SLG-WAM. As a result, SLGO, which shares soundness and completeness properties with SLG, formalizes the scheduling strategy of the SLG-WAM, and models SLG-WAM operations such as the table cut and existential negation [7]. Within the framework of SLGO, algorithms for incremental <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> subgoals can be proven correct, along with an evaluation strategy which avoids delay for modularly stratified programs. 1 Introduction SLG [1, 2] uses memoing to evaluate general logic programs.

We consider spaces denoted by W_M^p, defined as abstract <b>completions</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> smooth functions {{with respect to a}} weighted Sobolev-flavoured norm involving derivatives of all orders. Previously we showed that these classes behaves very differently on two sides of a condition on the weight sequence M. Here we prove a conjecture made in that paper; under some regularity assumptions on the weight, we show that {{on one side of the}} condition there will be a complete independence between derivatives, expressed as W_M^p L^p⊕ W_M_ 1 ^p where M_ 1 is the shifted sequence. On the other side, we already know that one can embed W_M^p into C^∞(R). Thus this is an instance of a kind of phase transition. Comment: Corrected mistake from previous version.
