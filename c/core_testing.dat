Method and results: In order to develop the classification framework of the National Registered Nurse's License Examination, RN's job descriptions, nursing standards, and the specific learning objectives of nursing courses were reviewed. And a survey was used to identify which entity would be appropriate for a reference to the basic <b>core</b> <b>test</b> items. 146 of professors from schools of nursing and members of each division of Korean Academic Society of Nursing(KASN) were participated in the survey. The study showed the 98 % of respondents agreed to use RN's job descriptions in selecting the basic <b>core</b> <b>test</b> items and 30 % for the basic <b>core</b> <b>test</b> would be appropriate. And the contents, the selection criteria, and the proportion of the basic <b>core</b> <b>test</b> items were developed by the members of this research, the members of the National RN's License Examination subcommittee, and the presidents of each division of KASN. The total of 1990 standard test items were selected among 3524 items, that 3 out of 7 members in the research team agreed to choose. Duplicated items in the standard items were deleted. 205 items out of the 1990 standard items were selected as the basic <b>core</b> <b>test</b> items.

40|$|<b>Core</b> <b>test</b> is {{commonly}} {{required in the}} area of concrete industry to evaluate the concrete strength and sometimes it becomes the unique tool for safety assessment of existing concrete structures. <b>Core</b> <b>test</b> is therefore introduced in most codes. An extensive literature survey on different international codes’ provisions; including the Egyptian, British, European and ACI Codes, for core analysis is presented. All studied codes’ provisions seem to be unreliable for predicting the in-situ concrete cube strength from the results of <b>core</b> <b>tests.</b> A comprehensive experimental study was undertaken to examine the factors affecting the interpretation of <b>core</b> <b>test</b> results. The program involves four concrete mixes, three concrete grades (18, 30 and 48  MPa), five core diameters (1. 5, 2, 3, 4 and 6  in.), five core aspect ratios (between 1 and 2), two types of coarse aggregates (pink lime stone and gravel), two coring directions, three moisture conditions and 18 different steel arrangements. Prototypes for concrete slabs and columns were constructed. More than 500 cores were prepared and tested in addition to tremendous number of concrete cubes and cylinders. Results indicate that the core strength reduces with the increase in aspect ratio, the reduction in core diameter, the presence of reinforcing steel, the incorporation of gravel in concrete, the increase in core moisture content, the drilling perpendicular to casting direction, and the reduction in concrete strength. The Egyptian code provision for core interpretation is critically examined. Based on the experimental evidences throughout this study, statistical analysis has been performed to determine reliable strength correction factors that account for the studied variables. A simple weighted regression analysis of a model without an intercept was carried out using the “SAS Software” package as well as “Data Fit” software. A new model for interpretation of <b>core</b> <b>test</b> results is proposed considering all factors affecting core strength.

40|$|Predictive state {{representations}} (PSRs) are {{a commonly}} used approach for agents to sum- marize {{the information from}} history generated during their interaction with a dynamical environment and the agents may use PSRs {{to predict the future}} observation. Existing works have shown the bene ts of PSRs for modelling partially observable dynamical systems. One of the key issues in PSRs is to discover a set of tests for representing states, which is called <b>core</b> <b>tests.</b> However, there is no very e cient technique to nd the <b>core</b> <b>tests</b> for a large and complex problem in practice. In this paper, we formulate the discovering of the set of <b>core</b> <b>tests</b> as an optimization problem and exploit a group sparsity of the decision-making matrix to solve the problem.

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThere {{has been}} a {{considerable}} research activity concerning the effect of brine chemistry on the mechanical behaviour of chalk since {{the discovery of the}} Ekofisk subsidence in the North Sea. Although the research on water weakening on chalk are extensive, the mechanism behind the weakening is still not fully understood. The objective of this thesis was to investigate how chalk mechanics are affected by different temperatures and chalk types during flooding of MgCl 2 brine. Mechanical tests were performed on 130, 92 and 60 C for two different outcrop chalk types; Mons (Belgium) and Kansas (Niobrara, US). The cores were loaded hydrostatically above yield up to a confining pressure of 14 MPa (Mons) or 24 MPa (Kansas) with a pore pressure of 0. 7 MPa, followed by a 60 days creep phase of constant stress and temperature. Fractioned effluent were analysed by an ion chromatograph and microscopic studies of the <b>tested</b> <b>core</b> by SEM-EDS were performed. During hydrostatic loading no significant difference in yield strength and in the bulk modulus was observed for Kansas chalk when comparing the test at different temperatures. While for the Mons chalk a difference between the <b>core</b> <b>tested</b> at 130 C was seen compared to the <b>cores</b> <b>tested</b> at lower temperatures (60 and 92 C). At 130 C Mons compacts less than at lower temperatures. During creep phase, on the other hand, temperature dependency on chalk compaction was observed for both Mons and Kansas chalk. Accelerating creep was observed for the core testes at 130 C causing a significant higher creep strain compared to the <b>cores</b> <b>tested</b> at lower temperatures. From ion chromatograph analysis, the dissolution-precipitation process between magnesium and calcium was seen to more or less have a one-to-one relationship. Magnesium precipitation and calcium dissolution increased with increasing temperature, which resulted in a higher core mass loss and more compaction as magnesium has a lower molar weight than calcium. These results were confirmed by higher core mass loss for higher temperatures. SEM-EDS analysis also confirmed these results when three cores, one for each testing temperature, were studied. The wt% of magnesium in the core was seen to increase with increasing testing temperature. Precipitation of magnesite was detected by the inlet side of the Mons <b>core</b> <b>tested</b> at 130 C. Analysis of effluent pH indicated that for <b>cores</b> <b>tested</b> at 130 C the pH is {{more or less the same}} as injected brine pH (5. 5 - 6. 0), while for <b>cores</b> <b>tested</b> at lower temperatures (60 and 92 C) the pH seemed to be higher (6. 1 - 6. 5) compared to injected brine pH...|$|R
