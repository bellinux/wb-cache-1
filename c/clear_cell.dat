5|$|<b>Clear</b> <b>cell</b> {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes}} up less than 5% of diagnosed endometrial cancer.

5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé can be {{difficult}} to diagnose from symptoms alone, because hereditary renal cancers, pneumothorax, and cutaneous tumors occur with other syndromes. Hereditary bilateral, multifocal kidney tumors similar to those seen in BHDcan occur with von Hippel–Lindau disease (<b>clear</b> <b>cell</b> renal cell carcinoma), hereditary papillary renal cancer (papillary renal cell carcinoma), and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome.

5|$|Cervical {{stenosis}} {{refers to}} an abnormally narrow cervical canal, typically associated with trauma caused by removal of tissue for investigation or treatment of cancer, or cervical cancer itself. Diethylstilbestrol, used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent preterm labour and miscarriage, is also strongly associated {{with the development of}} cervical stenosis and other abnormalities in the daughters of the exposed women. Other abnormalities include: vaginal adenosis, in which the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix becomes columnar; cancers such as <b>clear</b> <b>cell</b> adenocarcinomas; cervical ridges and hoods; and development of a cockscomb cervix appearance.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{people with}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} are at roughly seven times {{the risk of}} kidney cancer compared to the unaffected population. Estimates of the incidence among people with the disease range from 14%–34%. Rarely, it is associated with <b>clear</b> <b>cell</b> renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma. If it develops in someone with BHD, renal cell carcinoma occurs later in life and has a poor prognosis. Though the types of tumor typically associated with BHD are considered less aggressive, cases of advanced or metastatic kidney cancer have been observed in people with the syndrome. Both benign and cancerous tumors can reduce kidney function over time as they grow larger.|$|E
40|$|Luminal {{acidification}} in the epididymis {{is critical}} for sperm maturation and storage. <b>Clear</b> <b>cells</b> express the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) in their apical membrane and are major contributors to proton secretion. We showed that this process is regulated via recycling of V-ATPase-containing vesicles. We now report that RhoA and its effector ROCKII are enriched in rat epididymal <b>clear</b> <b>cells.</b> In addition, cortical F-actin was detected beneath the apical membrane and along the lateral membrane of “resting” <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> using a pan-actin antibody or phalloidin-TRITC. In vivo luminal perfusion of the cauda epididymal tubule with the ROCK inhibitors Y 27632 (10 – 30 μM) and HA 1077 (30 μM) or with the cell-permeable Rho inhibitor Clostridium botulinum C 3 transferase (3. 75 μg/ml) induced the apical membrane accumulation of V-ATPase and extension of V-ATPase-labeled microvilli in <b>clear</b> <b>cells.</b> However, these newly formed microvilli were devoid of ROCKII. In addition, Y 27632 (30 μM) or HA 1077 (30 μM) decreased the ratio of F-actin to G-actin detected by Western blot analysis in epididymal epithelial cells, and Y 27632 also decreased the ratio of F-actin to G-actin in <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting from B 1 -enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) transgenic mice. These results provide evidence that depolymerization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton via inhibition of RhoA or its effector ROCKII favors the recruitment of V-ATPase from the cytosolic compartment into the apical membrane in <b>clear</b> <b>cells.</b> In addition, our {{data suggest that the}} RhoA-ROCKII pathway is not locally involved in the elongation of apical microvilli.

40|$|Phospholipase Cγ 2 (PLCγ 2) -deficient mice exhibit misconnections {{of blood}} and lymphatic vessels, and male infertility. However, the cell type {{responsible}} for vascular partitioning and the mechanism for male infertility remain unknown. Accordingly, we generated a mouse line that conditionally expresses endogenous Plcg 2 in a Cre/loxP recombination-dependent manner, and found that Tie 2 -Cre- or Pf 4 -Cre-driven reactivation of Plcg 2 rescues PLCγ 2 -deficient mice from the vascular phenotype. By contrast, male mice rescued from the vascular phenotype exhibited epididymal sperm granulomas. As judged from immunostaining, PLCγ 2 was expressed in <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> in the epididymis. PLCγ 2 deficiency did not compromise differentiation of epididymal epithelial <b>cells,</b> including <b>clear</b> <b>cells,</b> and tube formation at postnatal week 2. However, luminal expansion of the epididymal duct was impaired during the prepubertal period, regardless of epithelial cell polarity and tube architecture. These results suggest that PLCγ 2 -deficient <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> cause impaired luminal expansion, stenosis of the epididymal duct, attenuation of luminal flow, and subsequent sperm granulomas. Clear cell-mediated luminal expansion is also supported by the observation that PLCγ 2 -deficient males were rescued from infertility by epididymal epithelium-specific reactivation of Plcg 2, although the edematous and hemorrhagic phenotype associated with PLCγ 2 deficiency also caused spontaneous epididymal sperm granulomas in aging males. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PLCγ 2 in <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> plays {{an essential role in}} luminal expansion of the epididymis during the prepubertal period in mice, and reveal an unexpected link between PLCγ 2, <b>clear</b> <b>cells,</b> and epididymal development...|$|R

The results are summarized as follows. 1) Under the hypercalcemic circumstances induced by administration of calcium chloride, parathyroid hormone or calcium lactate, the parathyroid gland showed generalized hypoplasia, atrophy and decrease of the <b>clear</b> <b>cells,</b> increase of dark cells, atrophy of the Golgi apparatus and complete absence of mitosis. 2) Under the hyperphosphatemic circumstance induced by administration of dibasic sodium phosphate or dibasic potassium phosphate or by renal incineration, the parathyroid gland showed marked generalized hyperplasia, hypertrophy and increase of the <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> and their nuclei, decrease of the dark cells, hypertrophy of the Golgi apparatus and presence of many mitotic figures. 3) With administration of potassium chloride or sodium chloride, hyperplasia of the tissue and hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> were observed with the former, while these changes were not so distinct with the latter. 4) The influence to the parathyroid gland was more evident with diffusible inorganic calcium than with organic calcium. 5) In the parathyroid gland of mice, very little lipid could be demonstrated, PAS positive granula and alkaline phosphatase activity were weakly shown and only small amount of RNA was recognized. 6) On {{the basis of the}} results described in 1) and 2), generalized tissue hyperplasia, especially hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> and decrease of the dark cells represent hyper parathyroid state, while atrophy and decrease of the <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> and increase of the dark cells report hyper parathyroid state. The acidophilic cells are supposed to bave 1 ess relation to calcium and phosphorus metabolism of the parathyroid gland. 7) The proliferation of the parathyroid gland was found to be accomplished by hyperplasia of the subcapsular fibroblastoid cells developing into dark cells followed by turning into <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> after their mitosis or by decrease of nuclear chromatin of dark <b>cells</b> shifting into <b>clear</b> <b>cells.</b> In hyper functioning state, the <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> proliferated with mitosis, while' in hypo functioning state a reverse shifting from <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> to dark cells was also demonstrated. 8) Hypo physectomy: Following hypophysectomy, the parathyroid gland showed increase in number of the dark cells and marked atrophy of the tissue and cell nuclei despite less decrease in number of the <b>clear</b> <b>cells.</b> These alterations suggested development of hypoparathyroidism. 9) Administration of ovarian follicle hormones: Following administration of a-estradiol,. hexestrol or acrylonitril-derivatives atrophy of tissue, decrease of the <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> and atophyof nuclei, representing probable hypoparathyroid state, were observed with the former two' hormones. With acrylonitril derivatives, hyperplasia of the tissue and nuclei and marked increase of <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> were observed, despite marked weightloss, suggesting probable develop-ment of hyperparathyroid state. 10) Administration of male sexual hormones: Following administration of methylandro-, stendiol, methyltestosterone or testosteron propionate generally the parathyroid tissue showed, hyperfunctioning histological pictures. This effect was especially intense with methylandro-, stendiol followed by in the order of methyltestosterone and testosterone propionate. 11) Administration of corpus lutein hormone: Following administration of corpus lutein hormone the parathyroid gland showed marked hyperfunctioning pictures which was next to that following methylandrostenediol. 12) Administration of adrenocortical hormones: Following administration of cortisone, despite marked weightloss, the parathyroid gland demonstrated hyper unctioning histological pictures with tissue hyperplasia and proliferation and hypertrophy of the <b>clear</b> <b>cells.</b> Following administration of DOCA the histological pictures were that in hypofunctioning state although, its was only slight in degree. 13) Gonadectomy: Following gonadectomy the parathyroid gland showed hyper unctioning state with hyperplasia of the tissue. 14) Hypophysectomy combined with administration of steroid hormone or gonadectomy : Hypoparathyroid state following hypophysectomy, which was described in 8), was further intensified by combination of administration of estradiol, hexestrol or DOCA. However, development of the post-hypophysectomy hypoparathyroidiom was slightly prevented by combination of gonadectomy, or administration of acrylonitril derivatives, methylandrostandiol, cortisone or progesterone. The results suggest that these steroid hormones have direct effect to the parathyroid gland without through the pituitary gland. The experimental results clearly demonstrated that parathyroid function is not only intensively influenced by blood calcium and phosphorus levels and kidney functions, but also is closedly related to other endocrine organs such as pituitary, ad rena Is and gonadal glands. It is supposed that the pituitary gland, adrenal cortex (cortisone) and testicle have accelerating actions upon the parathyroid gland, while the adrenal cortex (DOCA) and ovary have inhibiting works...|$|R

40|$|An acidic luminal pH in the {{epididymis}} {{contributes to}} maintaining sperm quiescent during their maturation and storage. The vacuolar H(+) ATPase (V-ATPase), located in narrow and <b>clear</b> <b>cells,</b> {{is a major}} contributor to luminal acidification. Mutations in one of the V-ATPase subunits, ATP 6 v 1 B 1 (B 1), cause distal renal tubular acidosis in humans but surprisingly, B 1 (-/-) mice do not develop metabolic acidosis and are fertile. While B 1 is located in the apical membrane of narrow and <b>clear</b> <b>cells,</b> the B 2 subunit localizes to subapical vesicles in wild-type mouse, rat and human epididymis. However, a marked increase (84 %) in the mean pixel intensity of B 2 staining was observed in the apical pole of <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> by conventional immunofluorescence, and relocalization into their apical membrane was detected by confocal microscopy in B 1 (-/-) mice compared with B 1 (+/+). Immunogold electron microscopy showed abundant B 2 in the apical microvilli of <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> in B 1 (-/-) mice. B 2 mRNA expression, determined by real time RT-PCR using laser-microdissected epithelial cells, was identical in both groups.

Finally, the luminal pH of the cauda epididymidis was the same in B 1 (-/-) mice as in B 1 (+/+) (pH 6. 7). These data indicate that whereas overall expression of B 2 is not affected in B 1 (-/-) mice, significant redistribution of B 2 -containing complexes occurs from intracellular compartments into the apical membrane of <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> in B 1 (-/-) mice.

We aimed to see the features and outcomes of this rare entity. METHODS: It was retrospective cohort conducted at the Department of Neurosurgery, Aga Khan University from 2003 to 2013. The medical records and radiology of patients with proven histopathology were reviewed. Analysis was done on SPSS 20. RESULTS: Eleven cases of ependymal tumors with <b>clear</b> <b>cells</b> were found, which equated to 1. 5 % of the total tumor burden in 11 years. The median age was 49 years. Most common presenting symptom was headache 54. 5 %. Out of 11 patients, 9 patients had a supratentorial tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging showed hypointense signals on T 1 and hyperintense signals on T 2 -weighted images in all cases. Contrast enhancement was found in 9 patients (77. 8 %), necrosis and hemorrhage was found in 4 (36 %) and 3 (27 %) patients, respectively. Immunohistochemistry showed glial fibrillary acidic protein and epithelial membrane antigen positivity in all cases. Ki- 67 showed high proliferative index in 6 patients. According to the World Health Organization grading of ependymal tumors, 2 patients had Grade II tumors, and 9 patients had Grade III tumors with <b>clear</b> <b>cells.</b> Gross total resection was achieved in 6 (54. 5 %) and subtotal resection in 5 patients (45. 4 %).
