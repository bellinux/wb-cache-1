40|$|Abstract. Cloud Computing {{has been}} envisioned as the {{next-generation}} architecture of IT Enterprise. Although envisioned as a promising service {{platform for the}} Internet, this new data storage paradigm in “Cloud ” brings about many challenging design issues which have profound influence on the security and performance of the overall system. This work studies the problem of ensuring the integrity of data <b>storage</b> in <b>Cloud</b> Computing. One of the biggest concerns with <b>cloud</b> data <b>storage</b> is that of data integrity verification at untrusted servers. To ensure <b>cloud</b> data <b>storage</b> security, {{it is critical to}} enable a third party auditor (TPA) to evaluate the service quality from an objective and independent perspective. We review Cloud Computing, <b>cloud</b> data <b>storage</b> and discuss data storage security based on analysis of cloud security treats. Extensive security and performance analysis show that the proposed schemes are highly efficient and provably secure...|$|R
