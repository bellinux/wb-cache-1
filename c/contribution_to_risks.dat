40|$|Abstract Background/Aims Sound and {{rigorous}} well-established, {{and newly}} extended, methods for genetic epidemiological analysis {{were used to}} analyze population evidence for genetic <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk</b> for numerous common cancer sites in Utah. The Utah Population Database (UPDB) has provided important illumination of the familial <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> cancer <b>risk</b> by cancer site. Methods With over 15 years of new cancer data since the previous comprehensive familial cancer analysis, we tested for excess familial clustering using an expanded Genealogical Index of Familiality (dGIF) methodology that provides for a more informative, but conservative test {{for the existence of}} a genetic <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> familial relatedness in cancer. Results Some new cancer sites have been analyzed for the first time, having achieved sufficiently large sample size with additions to the UPDB. This new analysis has identified 6 cancer sites with significant evidence for a heritable <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>risk,</b> including lip, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, thyroid, lung, prostate, and melanoma. Conclusions Both environmentally and genetically-based familial clustering have clinical significance, and these results support increased surveillance for cancer of the same sites among close relatives of affected individuals for many more cancers than are typically considered. </p...|$|R

40|$|It is of {{interest}} for national governments to assess strategic issues such as natural hazards and anthropogenic threats with some reference <b>to</b> <b>risk,</b> in order <b>to</b> support prioritisation of treatment solutions. With most threats of strategic relevance such as earthquakes, pandemics and terrorism following a distribution in size of events, representation of the risk for a threat as a single frequency– consequence pair is often inadequate as this single pair may exclude {{a significant portion of}} data and their <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> total <b>risk.</b> Identifying the entire distribution of event sizes and their frequencies is better suited for understanding the relative <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> total <b>risk</b> from high and low consequence events. If the distribution of event sizes does follow a law, the finite size of data-sets makes identifying the law difficult.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the contribution of}} non-interest income <b>to</b> systemic bank <b>risk.</b> Using the ∆CoVaR measure of Adrian and Brunnermeier (2010) as our proxy for systemic risk, we find banks with a higher non-interest income to interest income ratio have a higher <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> systemic <b>risk.</b> This suggests that activities that are not traditionally associated with banks (such as deposit taking and lending) {{are associated with a}} larger <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> systemic <b>risk.</b> When we decompose total non-interest income into three components, we find trading income and investment banking and venture capital income to be significantly related <b>to</b> systemic <b>risk.</b> The economic impact on systemic risk of investment banking and venture capital income is higher than that of trading income. Finally we find the impact of non-interest income on systemic <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> be prevalent in the 1990 and 2007 financial crises (which were bank based) and not in the case before the 2001 high tech bubble bust.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of the banks {{portfolio}} holdings of financial derivatives on the banks individual <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> systemic <b>risk</b> over and above the effect of variables related to size, interconnectedness, substitutability, and other balance sheet information. Using a sample of 91 U. S. bank holding companies from 2002 to 2011, we compare five measures of the banks <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> systemic <b>risk</b> and find that the new measure proposed in this study, Net Shapley Value, outperforms the others. Using this measure we find that the banks holdings of foreign exchange and credit derivatives increase the banks <b>contributions</b> <b>to</b> systemic <b>risk</b> whereas holdings of interest rate derivatives decrease it. Nevertheless, the proportion of non-performing loans over total loans and the leverage ratio have much stronger impact on systemic risk than derivatives holdings. We find that before the subprime crisis credit derivatives decreased systemic risk whereas during the crisis increased it. So, credit derivatives seemed to change their role from shock absorbers to shock issuers. This effect is not observed in the other types of derivatives...|$|R

The conclusion is that CoVaR can together with other systemic risk indicators help get {{a better understanding of the}} risks threatening the stability of the Swedish financial system...|$|R

40|$|Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is {{a method}} to {{identify}} and prioritize potential failures of a product or process.

The authors recommend two deployment strategies to address these shortcomings: 1) Organize the FMEA around failure scenarios rather than failure modes, and 2) Evaluate risk using probability and cost.

40|$|Systemic risk is {{the risk}} of a {{collapse}} of the entire financial system, typically triggered by the default of one, or more, interconnected financial institutions. In this paper, we estimate the systemic risk contribution of Italian-listed banks for the period 2000 – 2011. We follow a methodology first proposed by Adrian and Brunnermeier and measure banks' <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> systemic <b>risk</b> by ΔCoVaR, which measures the contribution of bank i to the financial system VaR when bank i {{is in a state of}} distress. We define ‘the system’ as the set of Italian-listed banks in the sample. First, we find that the information contained in ΔCoVaR is different from that contained in the VaR. Therefore, regulators should take it into account in order to monitor the systemic risk posed by banks. Second, recent policy debate has focused on the danger posed by large banks and on the need to curb their size. We find that size is indeed the main predictor of a bank <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> systemic <b>risk.</b> However, in the post-Lehman period, leverage is also an important predictor of systemic risk. Consequently, any financial regulation designed only to curb banks' size could not completely eliminate systemic risk because it is exactly in crisis times that leverage becomes relevant. Hence, we conclude that ΔCoVaR is a very useful policy tool for regulators that can estimate which factors are more relevant in terms of <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> systemic <b>risk...</b>|$|R
