40|$|The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) have {{recently}} proposed to mandate {{the use of}} direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> {{as part of their}} project to harmonise accounting standards. Despite the magnitude of the proposed change to <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> reporting, to date, the IASB and FASB have provided no empirical evidence under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to support their assertion that direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> provide financial statement users with useful information. Given the growing evidence that adopting IFRS significantly changes the quality of financial reporting information, the usefulness of direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> may have also changed. This thesis, therefore, examines the usefulness of reporting direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> under IFRS in Australia. Australia is specifically examined because {{it was one of the}} few countries where all firms were mandated to report direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements,</b> and which prohibited the early adoption of IFRS. The findings of this research show that, relative to Australian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (AGAAP), direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> are more value relevant after the adoption of IFRS. Moreover, the results demonstrate that direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> provide financial analysts with useful information for their <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> forecasts, and this information is more useful under IFRS compared to AGAAP. Finally, this thesis provides evidence that, while financial analysts use information from direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> when issuing stock recommendations, buy-and-hold investors are better off identifying mispriced stocks by using analysts’ <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> forecasts in discounted <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> valuation models. In sum, these results provide strong support for the current IASB/FASB proposal to mandate the use of direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> and are consistent with IFRS improving the information set of investors...|$|R

40|$|The <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> are logically {{generated}} from the cash account on the balance sheets {{in the same way}} as the income statements are {{generated from}} the undivided profit account on the balance sheets. But once the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> and <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> accounting are generated, they are incorporated into the double entry bookkeeping system and integrated into the general accounting system. In that system, the purpose of accounting is to grasp the corporate economic activities and fund movements in totality and the important statements are the trial balance of totals and trial balance of balances. The <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements,</b> income statements and balance sheets are derived from those trial balances. In that sense, the former means a <b>flow</b> <b>statement</b> of general fund and the latter means a stock statement of general fund. The accounting is a total process from records of transactions to publications of financial statements through preparations of those statements. Therefore, this theory is the process accounting theory and this accounting is the integrated accounting...|$|R

40|$|Thomas {{emphasizes}} that allocations {{in the traditional}} accounting are all arbitrary, they can not represent the real-world, and income statements prepared by allocations are nonsense.

His accounting thoughts are so-called semantic approaches and ones that lay stress on accounting figures reflecting the external world. Such accounting thoughts have several limitations when we think accounting from the total view point. His financial statements can not describe financial positions nor earning powers of business enterprises. Moreover, functions of his <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> are not clear because in his accounting thoughts accounting function theories are weak as a result of laying stress on semantic approaches.

40|$|After {{the near}} {{collapse}} of the global financial system in 2008, much of the debate has focused on credit and asset valuation, as well as liquidity issues in the financial sector. Emphasis has been on debt and balance sheet quality, but little {{focus has been on}} the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> of banks. The <b>statement</b> of <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> is designed to illustrate financial strength and liquidity with information about operations, investment and financing. <b>Cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> generally show operational stability and funding, outflow and inflow of cash, as important factors of firm’s financial resilience. In this respect banks are different and their <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> are simply not used. The aim of this thesis is to study how <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> of banks are different from non-financial firms to understand why they are not used. This includes research on how the accounting standard functions for banks and identify special issues of <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> in banks. Four studies are used to gather evidence and evaluations of the accounting framework and the financial statements in order to describe facts and interpret bankers’ opinions. The big Scandinavian banks are selected as study objects and thirty bankers interviewed. Historical comment letters are analysed as well as fourteen years of financial statements. The accounting rules for banks and <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> are described in the first study. The second study concerns the accounting regulation process and confirms that prior to the standard setting, bankers warned that it would not function in banks. Long-term financial statement analysis in the third study illustrates the negative operative <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> in the banks over a decade. The final study, interviewing bankers about the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> in banks, confirms that none of them uses the statement and they have never been asked about it. The main findings indicate that standard <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> do not work for banks because banks’ operations are different from non-financial firms with respect to cash. The reason why bankers do not use the statements is that they do not consider the information provided to be relevant. The results furthermore indicate that the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> of banks are not used because the existing accounting standard does not consider the credit creation function in banks. This is exemplified in the negative operative <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> during periods of lending growth. Banks are different from other firms and the reporting of banks’ <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> functions differently because cash is their product and they create deposits on their balance sheet when providing loans to their customers. The accounting transaction of lending does not involve any prior funding or cash inflow, but occurs in the accounting system, creating deposit as a liability and loan as an asset of the bank. These results contribute to the debate needed in accounting and banking about useful <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> for banks and provide an overview to prepare new accounting regime...|$|R

The Problems are the followings：（ 1 ）cash <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> are subordinate to balance sheets and income statements {{from the viewpoint of}} the accounting structure，（ 2 ）cash inflow and cash outflow in worksheets are recorded on the opposite sides of the logically right sides，（ 3 ）the titles of accounts are verbose. The fundamental reason of these problems is that <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> are prepared from balance sheets and income statements and notprepared through the double entry bookkeeplng system.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{if there has}} been a change in the value relevance of direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> components since the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in Australia.

In addition, for industrial firms there is {{a significant increase in the}} value relevance of direct <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> after IFRS, along with an increase in the value relevance of accruals. These results are consistent with the proposition that direct <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> play a reinforcing role that complements the more complex IFRS accounts. Consequently, if the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) were to mandate direct <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>statements</b> it would, in all likelihood, provide users of accounts with a valuable incremental source of hard transaction information...|$|R
