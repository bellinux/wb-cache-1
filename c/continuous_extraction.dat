50|$|To avoid {{contamination}} and suppress {{the formation of}} by-products (which are difficult to remove) the reaction must be performed under careful control of mass ratios and process conditions. Excess sulfite (SO32−) or bisulfite (HSO3−) lead to an unpleasant odor of the downstream product, higher levels of ethylene glycol or glycol ethers (formed by the hydrolysis and ethoxylation of ethylene oxide) give hygroscopic and greasy surfactants. Concentrated ethylene glycol-containing sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate solutions can subsequently mostly be freed from ethylene glycol by <b>continuous</b> <b>extraction</b> with e.g. isopropanol (<0.5%). Therefore, in the continuous industrial process an aqueous sodium hydrogen sulfite solution is prepared in a first reactor by mixing a sodium hydroxide solution and sulfur dioxide. In a second reactor the sodium hydrogen sulfite solution is mixed with a slight excess of ethylene oxide to obtain sodium 2-hydroxyethyl sulfonate in almost quantitative yields at elevated temperature and pressure with a precise control of pH. The reaction has to take place under the exclusion of oxygen and under precise control of the stoichiometry of the reactants, the temperature, the pH and the throughput.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the shape factor on a {{reversing}} <b>continuous</b> countercurrent <b>extraction</b> process for concentration profiles is reported. Garcinia fruit was selected as a model solid while sucrose was used as soluble solid for the diffusion system.

A better diffusion mass transfer in the slab shape leads to a better yield. The shape factor results were verified using a model solid system. The phenomena in reversing <b>continuous</b> countercurrent <b>extraction</b> process under steady-state conditions can be explained via a backmixing-diffusion model.

40|$|Two {{methods for}} the {{supercritical}} fluid extraction (SFE) of analytes from aqueous media were evaluated: direct extraction and solid-phase extraction (SPE) discs.
