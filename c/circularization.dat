5|$|Triton's {{eccentric}} post-capture orbit {{would have}} {{also resulted in}} tidal heating of its interior, which could have kept Triton fluid for a billion years; this inference is supported by evidence of differentiation in Triton's interior. This source of internal heat disappeared following tidal locking and <b>circularization</b> of the orbit.|$|E
5|$|The hot-Jupiters and warm-Jupiters {{are thought}} to have {{migrated}} to their current orbits during or following their formation. A number of possible mechanisms for this migration have been proposed. Type I or Type II migration could smoothly decrease the semimajor axis of the planet's orbit resulting in a warm- or hot-Jupiter. Gravitational scattering by other planets onto eccentric orbits with a perihelion near the star followed by the <b>circularization</b> of its orbit due to tidal interactions with the star can leave a planet on a close orbit. If a massive companion planet or star on an inclined orbit was present an exchange of inclination for eccentricity via the Kozai mechanism raising eccentricities and lowering perihelion followed by <b>circularization</b> can also result in a close orbit. Many of the Jupiter sized planets have eccentric orbits which may indicate that gravitational encounters occurred between the planets, although migration while in resonance can also excite eccentricities. The in situ growth of hot Jupiters from closely orbiting super Earths has also been proposed. The cores in this hypothesis could have formed locally or at a greater distance and migrated close to the star.|$|E

The method described was named chromosome jumping, to emphasize the contrast with an older and much more time-consuming method of copying DNA fragments called chromosome walking.|$|E

5000|$|Another notable {{circular}} miRNA sponge is SRY. SRY, {{which is}} highly expressed in murine testes, {{functions as a}} miR-138 sponge. [...] In the genome, SRY is flanked by long inverted repeats (IRs) over 15.5 kilobases (kb) in length. When {{one or both of}} the IRs are deleted, <b>circularization</b> does not occur. It was this finding that introduced the idea of inverted repeats enabling <b>circularization.</b>|$|E

50|$|DNA <b>circularization</b> {{depends on}} both the axial (bending) {{stiffness}} and torsional (rotational) stiffness of the molecule. For a DNA molecule to successfully circularize it must be long enough to easily bend into the full circle and must have the correct number of bases so the ends are in the correct rotation to allow bonding to occur. The optimum length for <b>circularization</b> of DNA is around 400 base pairs (136 nm), with an integral number of turns of the DNA helix, i.e., multiples of 10.4 base pairs. Having a non integral number of turns presents a significant energy barrier for <b>circularization,</b> for example a 10.4 x 30 = 312 base pair molecule will circularize hundreds of times faster than 10.4 x 30.5 ≈ 317 base pair molecule.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two issues}} related to Short-jump libraries. First, a read can pass through the {{biotinylated}} <b>circularization</b> junction and reduce the effective read length. Second, reads from non-jumped fragments (i.e. fragments without the <b>circularization</b> junction) are sequenced and reduce genomic coverage. It {{has been reported that}} non-jumped fragments range from 4% to 13%, {{depending on the size of}} selection. The first problem might be solved by shearing circles into a larger size and select for those larger fragments. The second problem can be addressed by using Custom Barcoded Jumping Library.|$|E
5000|$|Exons from {{circular}} RNAs {{with only}} one circularized exon were much longer than those from circular RNAs with multiple circularised exons, indicating that processing may prefer a certain length to maximize exon(s) <b>circularization.</b>|$|E
50|$|In contrast, Capture by <b>Circularization</b> methods {{demonstrate}} less uniformity {{compared to}} other methods. This is because the probe design for each distinct genomic target is unique and thus the performance between individual probes may vary.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, the Nuclear Ligation Assay was published, {{a method}} that could {{determine}} <b>circularization</b> frequencies of DNA in solution. This assay was used to show that estrogen induces an interaction between the prolactin gene promoter and a nearby enhancer.|$|E

50|$|Capture by {{selective}} <b>circularization</b> method: The genomic DNA is digested into fragments with restriction enzymes.

50|$|The {{plausible}} {{sizes of}} the target that can be captured are limited since i) Large gap region leads to steric constraints for the intramolecular <b>circularization</b> of the probe and ii) Large gap requires longer probes be synthesized, increasing the costs.|$|E
50|$|Tidal <b>circularization</b> is {{an effect}} of the tidal forces between an {{orbiting}} body, and the primary object that it orbits whereby the eccentricity of the orbit is reduced over time so that the orbit becomes less elliptical and more circular.|$|E
5000|$|For {{a typical}} GTO with a semi-major axis of 24,582 km, perigee {{velocity}} is 9.88 km/s and apogee velocity is 1.64 km/s, clearly making the inclination change far less costly at apogee. In practice, the inclination change {{is combined with}} the orbital <b>circularization</b> (or [...] "apogee kick") burn to reduce the total V for the two maneuvers. The combined V is the vector sum of the inclination change V and the <b>circularization</b> V, and as {{the sum of the}} lengths of two sides of a triangle will always exceed the remaining side's length, total V in a combined maneuver will always be less than in two maneuvers. The combined V can be calculated as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|A second burn of {{the upper}} stage was required, and was {{completed}} successfully, during the SES-8 mission in order to place the SES-8 telecommunications satellite into the highly elliptical supersynchronous orbit for satellite operator SES to effect a plane change and orbit <b>circularization.</b>|$|E

50|$|RNA virus genomes (the + {{strands of}} which are {{translated}} as mRNA) are also commonly circularized.

50|$|Its {{propulsion}} system {{was composed of}} two R-4D LAE with a thrust of 490 N. It also had two axial and four radial 22 N bipropellant thrusters for station keeping and attitude control. It included enough propellant for orbit <b>circularization</b> and 8 years of operation.|$|E
50|$|It {{was decided}} to launch Superbird-6 into a 2,895 minutes period supersynchronous orbit with an apogee of 120,679 km, a perigee of 1,138 km and a 25.5° inclination. This extreme perigee and a six-maneuvers <b>circularization</b> program would reduce the {{propellant}} expenditure to its final position in geosynchronous orbit.|$|E
50|$|The {{satellite}} used a bipropellant {{propulsion system}} with a IHI BT-4 Liquid Apogee Engine for orbit <b>circularization</b> and thrusters and reaction wheels for station keeping and attitude control.

50|$|Cre {{recombinase}} plays {{important roles}} in {{the life cycle of}} the P1 Bacteriophage. Upon infection of a cell the Cre-loxP system is used to cause <b>circularization</b> of the P1 DNA.

50|$|Lambda phage genetic {{material}} {{consists of a}} double-stranded DNA molecule with 5' twelve-base-pair sticky ends (cos sites), which permit <b>circularization</b> of the DNA molecule.

5000|$|More generally, {{firing a}} rocket engine {{to place a}} vehicle into the desired final orbit from a {{transfer}} orbit is labelled an [...] "orbital insertion burn," [...] or (for cases where the desired orbit is circular) a <b>circularization</b> burn.

50|$|All {{forms of}} {{projectile}} launchers {{are at least}} partially hybrid systems if launching to low Earth orbit, due to the requirement for orbit <b>circularization,</b> at a minimum entailing several percent of total delta-v to raise perigee (e.g. a tiny rocket burn), or in some concepts much more from a rocket thruster to ease ground accelerator development.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} capture specificity, Capture by <b>Circularization</b> methods {{demonstrate}} the best results. This {{is due to}} the fact that all methods in this class require two ends of the same DNA molecule (e.g. two ends of MIP probes) to simultaneously bind to a single cognate partner molecule (e.g. genomic target region) in the proper configuration for successful ligation.|$|E
50|$|Other {{mechanisms}} for <b>circularization</b> exist, particularly in virus mRNA. Poliovirus mRNA uses a cloverleaf section towards its 5' end to bind PCBP2, which binds poly(A)-binding protein, forming the familiar mRNA-protein-mRNA circle. Barley yellow dwarf virus has binding between mRNA segments on its 5' end and 3' end (called kissing stem loops), circularizing the mRNA without any proteins involved.|$|E
