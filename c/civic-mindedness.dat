5|$|Calhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, {{helped shape}} his son's {{political}} views. He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on {{a commitment to}} the ideal of popular self-government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing {{in a world in which}} slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult. He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the <b>civic-mindedness</b> that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was the key to the success of the American dream.|$|E

50|$|Although Haitian peasant villages {{generally}} {{lacked a}} sense of community and <b>civic-mindedness,</b> some civic-action groups had emerged over the years. After the 1960s, wealthy peasants led rural community councils, which were supervised by the government. These councils often served more to control the flow of development resources into an area than to represent the local population. In the 1980s, a countervailing movement of small peasant groups (groupman) emerged with support from the Roman Catholic Church, principally in the Plateau Central. The groupman discussed common interests and undertook some cooperative activities. Both the Duvalier governments and the succeeding National Council of Government (Conseil National de Gouvernement—CNG), headed by Lieutenant General Henri Namphy, took steps to curb the activities of these peasant groups.|$|E

50|$|Leipzig, Rauch's city of birth, {{is known}} {{historically}} {{as a city}} of trade through its association with the Leipzig Trade Fair. This <b>civic-mindedness</b> of a trader's city also expressed itself under communism where Leipzig {{was the center of}} popular resistance that led to Die Wende. Rauch uses characters and images of life of pre-communist civil society that was oppressed by communism in the GDR. The oppression of communism and the total control of civic life under the rule of communist ideology is one of the elements of Rauch's work. The destructive powers of ideologies is perhaps the reason why Rauch refuses to interpret his own work as a powerful statement in favor of a cultural relativism that characterized the civic bourgeois thought that was destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|Citizen {{journalism is}} not to be {{confused}} with community journalism or civic journalism, both of which are practiced by professional journalists. Collaborative journalism is also a separate concept and is the practice of professional and non-professional journalists working together. Similarly, Social Journalism is a separate concept denoting a digital publication with a hybrid of professional and non-professional journalism. Citizen journalism is a specific form of both citizen media and user-generated content. By juxtaposing the term [...] "citizen", with its attendant qualities of <b>civic-mindedness</b> and social responsibility, with that of [...] "journalism", which refers to a particular profession, Courtney C. Radsch argues that this term best describes this particular form of online and digital journalism conducted by amateurs, because it underscores the link between the practice of journalism and its relation to the political and public sphere.|$|E

We conducted two qualitative studies. First, we investigated the learning experiences of four teams of undergraduate business students, who undertook semester-long course-embedded service-learning projects in partnership with four Hong Kong-based social enterprises. The students described five modes of civic engagement as project purposes, mentioned applying six types of service leadership practice for civic improvement, and described eight types of developmental outcome within the domain of <b>civic-mindedness.</b> Comparisons suggested that besides relational support through training and guidance, empowering infrastructure, opportunities to exercise autonomy, and opportunities to demonstrate competence, three project-related features that varied between projects were important in fostering <b>civic-mindedness.</b> These were direct contact with grassroots-based beneficiaries; the experience of making a tangible difference; and linking the campus with the wider community.

40|$|Although {{discourse}} on the civic engagement of libraries as institutions is plentiful, {{there has been little}} discussion of librarians as individuals. Librarianship is more than being a trustee of information. It includes responsibility for the common good. Libraries provide tools for education on social and political issues, but they can also collaborate in activities that improve well-being in their communities. Participating in service learning is one way that librarians on academic campuses can get involved. This study used a standardized scale to measure <b>civic-mindedness</b> among academic librarians and examine characteristics and activities, including service learning, related to variation in its scores. Results indicated that although most respondents made financial or service contributions, the group mean on the <b>civic-mindedness</b> scale was only moderate. Librarians who volunteered, had interest in service learning, or participated in community activities were more civic-minded than professionals who did not. Implications for the profession are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{argues that}} critics have {{overlooked}} {{the importance of}} the 1970 s in David Foster Wallace’s The Pale King. Critical focus on the novel’s depiction of 1980 s neoliberalism downplays the way it asks readers to consider that decade’s changes to be dependent on the transformation of civic ideals in the 1970 s. This can be seen most clearly in Chris Fogle’s narrative, which this essay argues is an emblematic 1970 s story, incorporating the decade’s tropes of malaise, uncertainty, self-examination, and surveillance. While Fogle’s conversion from selfish student to IRS worker may be seen to run counter to the growth of individualism and suspicion of institutions in the 1970 s, this essay argues that Wallace uses it to revive and ventriloquize arguments about <b>civic-mindedness</b> {{that took place in the}} 1970 s, ultimately offering a definition of <b>civic-mindedness</b> that echoes the work of writers such as Christopher Lasch and Robert N. Bellah...|$|E

S. Students from across the world has been studying abroad in the U. S. for decades because of the advanced research and infrastructural facilities here. Compared to the international students studying abroad in the U. S., the number of U. S. students studying abroad has been negligible according to Open Doors data reported by Institute of International Education. The Lincoln Commission report in 2005 emphasized the need to change this trend and provide more American students with international experience for American 2 ̆ 7 s own competitiveness and national security. It is widely accepted that Study Abroad helps to broaden student 2 ̆ 7 s perspective, which in turn helps to foster peace and understanding- 2 ̆ 2 it prepares a new generation for global citizenship 2 ̆ 2 (IIE white paper, 2007, p. 7). In my research I have conducted surveys of students before and after studying abroad for a semester to evaluate if there is any change in student attitudes towards global <b>civic-mindedness</b> and engagement after studying abroad. My sample consisted of students from two international study abroad programs administered by a private American university. My aim was to measure the learning outcome of these programs. Interestingly, I found from the pre-study abroad surveys that both groups of students in my study already had quite a favorable attitude towards global <b>civic-mindedness</b> before studying abroad. Also, I did not find statistically significant difference in student attitudes before and after study abroad. However, student response to questions on demographic background and open-ended questions provided some insights about the probable reasons for such a result. Therefore, this study provides understanding of the variables that must be controlled for future study to assess change in student attitudes as learning outcome of study abroad programs...|$|E

40|$|The {{last several}} decades have {{witnessed}} the proliferation and popularity of volunteering both {{as a means for}} individuals to connect with social issues and as a way of sustaining nonprofit organizations; indeed, it dominates contemporary discussions about civic engagement. Whereas some social theorists have promoted volunteering as a benchmark to assess democratic participation, <b>civic-mindedness,</b> social capital, and trust (Putnam, 2000), others have questioned the uncomplicated associations among volunteering, civic engagement, and community (Ganesh & McAllum, 2009). Like Snyder (2001), we position volunteering as a “hybrid strain of helping” (p. 16309) that falls between spontaneous bystander intervention and highly obligated caregiving. Specifically, we propose that volunteering involves sustained identity investments by volunteers performed and realized in organizational settings...|$|E
40|$|Scholars {{in various}} fields {{have speculated that}} the commercialization of mass media {{has contributed to the}} decline of civic culture. They contend that the {{personal}} needs emphasized by product-saturated mass media diminish <b>civic-mindedness</b> by creating an individualistic consumption-oriented culture. Despite this critique, some scholars argue that mass media do not erode civic culture in favor of consumer culture; rather, the two are thought to be positively interrelated. Although these contrasting perspectives have been repeatedly discussed, research has rarely empirically investigated these contending claims. We examine media influences on civic and consumer culture while considering the interrelationships of consumer attitudes and behaviors with civic participation using the 2000 DDB Life Style Study. In doing so, we distinguish between news and entertainment media and between socially conscious and status-oriented consumption. A latent variable structural equation model is used to test hypotheses. Results suggest that consumption behaviors and civic participation are not conflicting, even though media foster commercial attitudes and motivate consumption. Overall, media effects on this dynamic are positive, suggesting that critiques of media demobilization may be misplaced. Keywords civic participation, consumer culture, entertainment media, media effects, news media, socially conscious consumption, status-oriented consumption Scholars in a variety of fields have speculated about the negative effects of mass media on civic life. Typically, these critiques stress factors such as time displacement from civic activities (Putnam, 1995) and the cultivation of “mean world ” perceptions (Gerbner, Gross, Morgan, & Signorielli, 1980) that lead to social mistrust. However, a third criticism of media has emerged, the contention that the commercialization of media diminishes <b>civic-mindedness</b> by creating a consumption-oriented culture (Bennett, 1996, 1998...|$|E
