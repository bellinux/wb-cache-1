Due to {{the rapid growth of}} their trading and operations during the latter part of 2008 and into the first quarter of 2009, there was a need to address some specific operating issues. Future investors were concerned that the Company would struggle to process the forecasted volume of Refiners' Packs. So a consulting company (Synergetics Installations Worldwide Inc.), based in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, were invited to analyze and then upgrade the current operating processes, with a view to meeting customer service levels and processing significantly higher volumes. The first requirement was to relocate the entire business from relatively small premises to a medium-sized and secure interim site, pending the redevelopment of an existing commercial / industrial unit in the Pompano Beach area, which then became their headquarters in the US. Processing facilities and procedures were upgraded, as were the <b>customer</b> <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> operations and administrative functions. Once the customer service levels and performance of these processes had stabilized within the US operation, the Company launched the Cash4Gold proposition into the United Kingdom, then into other mainland European countries.

This article sets out the approach to this project, the written survey questionnaire generated, the results and the implications for CIPO's Outreach Program. The questionnaire was distributed to a limited number of Intellectual Property Outreach Organisations (IP Offices and the European Commission) around the world, including CIPO itself, to obtain information on key program activities, key targeted clients, key strategic partners and related program design details. For comparison purposes, the same questionnaire was also sent to a small number of other Canadian "Non-IP" Organisations in order to learn more about their information dissemination practices. The responses, while containing varying degrees of completeness, when combined with other available research material, provided useful comparisons with current and planned CIPO dissemination strategies. Top-ranked programs include Internet Web site information, Customer Call Centres, publications and speaking engagements. Broad conclusions are that CIPO's major programs and key clients closely parallel those of the other IP Outreach Organisations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our {{research}} {{was to develop a}} PLE (personal learning environment) design framework for workplace settings. By doing such, the research has answered this research question, how should a technology-based personal learning environment be designed, aiming at supporting learners to gain control over their learning at the workplace? We defined a PLE as an activity space encompassing learning objectives, tools, strategies and resources (i. e. tools, content, and people) to support and facilitate personal learning endeavours of learners, see definition 1. 1 in chapter 1. In this definition personal learning refers to the ways the learner pursues to address own learning requirements and gain control over learning taking advantage of the provided learning resources in the learning environment, see definition 1. 2 in chapter 1. Accordingly, we defined the PLE design framework as abstracted design knowledge comprised of the core principles of personal learning, design principles, technological components, and implementation guidelines, see definition 1. 3 in chapter 1. By incorporating the design research approaches in information systems (IS) and education domains, we outlined a design-based research strategy comprised of theoretical, empirical, and internal grounding processes to develop the PLE design framework. The theoretical grounding process, as described in chapter 2, was meant to increase the robustness of the PLE design framework by grounding it in theory. To this end, we performed a literature review study to realize the theoretical constructs, characteristics and objectives of the PLE concept. Then we utilized these insights in order to develop a learner’s control model defining three roles for a learner within the learning environment, being: the learner as ‘decision maker’, ‘knowledge developer’, and ‘socializer’. These roles aim to facilitate and promote personal agency of the learner within the learning environment. The purpose of the empirical grounding process was to increase the relevancy of the PLE design framework. Accordingly, in the empirical grounding process we focused on exploring and identifying the factors within the workplace that affect learner’s control and personal agency and realizing the requirements of both learner and organization to support personal learning. To this end, a multi-case design-based research was conducted in two contexts, namely, the Amadeus Lyceum secondary school and the <b>customer</b> <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> (CCC) of the Achmea Company both in the Netherlands. Regardless of their different contextual conditions, both design cases shared the same characteristics of the workplace where the learning is driven by working. In each design case we chose two units of analysis for examining the learner’s as well as organization’s views on the requirements of personal learning. The results of the empirical grounding process have revealed that learners go through a nonlinear co-regulating personal learning process consisting of accessing to the provided learning resources, ‘forethought’, ‘performing’, and ‘reflecting’ phases. Furthermore, it has been realized that when the learners are provided with appropriate amount of control and support they participate in constructing and adapting the learning environment by introducing new learning objectives, tools, content, or social asset through the ‘feeding back’ phase. After the insights on the theoretical and practical requirements of personal learning have been captured, we compared, analysed and synthesized these insights in the internal grounding process to develop the PLE design framework by identifying its four key components. Derived from the learner’s control model, the learner’s roles as ‘decision maker’, ‘knowledge developer’, and ‘socializer’ have been designated as three core principles of personal learning. Designating these core principles aims at giving active roles to the learner and placing s/he at the centre of the learning environment. Furthermore, we designated ‘providing learning support’ as another core principle of personal learning. This core principle is meant to harmonize the personal learning endeavours of the learners with the organization’s requirements and objectives through seeding/initiating the learning environment with organization-provided learning resources. Moreover, we chose ‘forethought’, ‘performing’, ‘reflecting’ and ‘feeding back’ as another set of the core principles of personal learning. These core principles facilitate the first leap from theory to practice in the PLE design framework. After the core principles of personal learning have been identified, we synthesized and intersected them to designate 15 design principles as the second key components of the PLE design framework. These design principles facilitate the second leap from theory into practice in the PLE design framework. Finally, armed with the observations and evidence from the empirical grounding process, we identified a set of technological components and implementation guidelines to address each design principle. This technological components and implementation guidelines represent the third leap from theory into practice in the PLE design framework. For more detail about the components of the PLE design framework see chapter 7. The developed PLE design framework conceptualizes personal learning as an interconnected process of decision making, knowledge creation, and socializing directed by the learner and facilitated by the organization. Through the lens of this framework, the learning environment is a dynamic and adaptable entirety consisting of organization-, learner-defined learning objectives, strategies, and learning resources. The development of this learning environment is envisioned per se as an important learning process and the learning environment is considered as a shared dynamic outcome evolved and adapted through cooperation between the learners and organization. To operationalize this vision, the PLE design framework reconciles the learners’ and organization’s views on the requirements and specifications of personal learning and competency development. On one hand, the PLE design framework aligns and harmonizes the personal learning endeavors of the learners with the learning requirements and objectives of the organization expressed in the organization-provided learning choices. On the other hand, it provides opportunities for the learners to pursue their personal learning needs and interests by exploring and learning the provided learning choices and evolve the learning environment by contextualizing, maturing, and developing new learning choices in terms of learning objectives, tools, content, strategies, and social asset.

Early <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> were seen as cost centres and operated in a similar manner, often resulting in poor and unsatisfactory performance. Modern <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> are being approached in a different way. They are aligned with the strategic objectives of the organisation and are seen as performance centres and revenue drivers. Modern <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> are dynamic and complex organisations, both technologically and operationally. Performance objectives are often conflicting and controlling parameters have to be finely balanced in a volatile environment. It is therefore imperative to utilise <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> effectively and efficiently. This can only be achieved by a structured and scientific operations research based approach. The research was initiated by the requirement of a <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> design and implementation as part of a larger business process reengineering project.

40|$|As an {{integral}} part of most organisations today <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> {{play a key role in}} the service delivery chain. Value creation is in the eye of the beholder, if organisations fail to deliver value to their customers, there will inevitably be a loss for stakeholders over the longer term. Presently in many industries, <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> are the primary source of contact for customers. This important role implies that the performance management of <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> is of critical importance to organisations, especially the delivery of customer satisfaction. In this research the ways organisations measure and manage <b>customer</b> satisfaction in <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> is explored. Clear evidence that current measures of performance in <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> are often counter-productive to achieving customer satisfaction is revealed. Many <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> seem to have fallen into the trap of believing that operational measures such as call duration are indicators of customer satisfaction. Evidence indicates that they are not; they are only measures of efficiency, which in turn is seen as determinant of financial performance. Most <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> seem to miss the important link between employee satisfaction, service quality, customer satisfaction, and profitability. In 12 case studies of world-leading <b>call</b> <b>centres,</b> the research identifies various managerial implications to avoid the "efficiency trap" in measuring and managing <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> performance. The managerial implications of this research are as follows: l <b>Call</b> <b>centre</b> performance is increasingly important for delivering <b>customer</b> service. <b>Call</b> <b>centre</b> performance should not be measured in isolation from the performance of the whole organisation. In most cases they are not detached operations with a solitary goal of driving down costs. <b>Call</b> <b>centres</b> are {{an integral}} part of an organisations value chain delivering its services and products. Therefore, the performance measures of <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> need to reflect the strategic direction of the entire organisation. l A more balanced approach to measuring performance based on strategic objectives is valuable, especially if visual representations of service delivery and value creation are used. This enables easy communication of overall performance and puts efficiency targets in perspective. Best practice seems to be to track the following areas of performance as well as their interactions: employee satisfaction, service quality, customer satisfaction, and satisfaction of other stakeholders (e. g. financial performance) with particular emphasis on the intangible performance drivers. l Customer dialogue is important and <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> are in fact listening to and speaking with customers all the time. Measuring customer satisfaction should start with understanding customers. Communication is often very task orientated, whereas <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> need to recognise the importance of listening to the customers in order to: - understand their needs and requirements from their perspective - detect failures, bottle necks, or improvement potential - deliver service that satisfies the customer. l It is critical to understand and classify the nature of demand. Often calls are unwanted or even unwittingly generated by other parts of the organisation. By analysing and classifying demand, it becomes more manageable and more predictable. Unwanted calls could then be reduced or even eliminated. Overall, a strategy-driven and integrated approach towards performance measurement in <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> will, therefore, improve operational efficiency and contribute to continuous innovation of the organisation as a whole.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Public Relations Management)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011. This {{research}} {{investigates the}} application of the quality management systems at a computer contact centre in Cape Town. It examines the issues around brand switching from the products supported by the computer customer contact centre to those manufactured by competitors. Its main interest is to interrogate the reasons <b>customers</b> give to <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> agents when they decide to switch brands. It also hopes to find out whether call agents understand the interrelation between quality management, brand loyalty and customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the project uses employee responses to ascertain whether the concept of quality management is synonymous with customer satisfaction and whether employee fulfilment leads to innovation and customer satisfaction. To address the main concerns of this project, Deming's model of quality management is used as the main conceptual framework. The key concepts underlying this model are visionary leadership, internal and external cooperation, learning/training, process management, continuous improvement, employee fulfilment and customer satisfaction. To find out the reasons that <b>customers</b> give to <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> agents when they decide to switch brands and also to respond to sub research questions, a quantitative research method was selected. A questionnaire was administered to 100 employees out of a 300 population. Although the customers' voices would have added value to the research project, the researcher decided to concentrate on employees because of the following reasons: 1) the interaction with customer begins and ends with agents, therefore agents are always aware of the reasons why customers switch brands; 2) the customers are in excess of 100, 000, 000 and selecting a representative sample for a mini thesis was not very feasible, given that the thesis is constrained by time and volume...|$|R

In this study, 100 English telephone conversations (approximately 52, 600 words) have been collected from the Philippines and transcribed in Hong Kong during 2005 to 2007. From these data a sample of problematic conversations between the Filipino CSR and Ameri-can customers have been extracted, and analysed for interpersonal meaning; the findings are discussed in the present paper. In particular, in this paper I will focus on interpersonal mean-ing, and specifically Appraisal in what appears to be communication problems. The findings from this study will support the training and services offered by this developing in-dustry. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{offshoring}} of <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> to cheaper countries, such as India, is {{a popular}} topic of discussion at the moment. This practice raises a number of ethical and organisational considerations. But how is it affecting the customers of these organisations? This research will investigate how student consumers {{have been affected by}} the offshoring trend in terms of service quality, customer satisfaction and loyalty. The research questioned people's general experiences of <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> so included; telephone companies, banks, utilities companies, National Rail Enquiries and others. After carrying out 60 supervised questionnaires with students it was discovered that service quality and <b>customer</b> satisfaction with <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> has fallen as a result of offshoring. Loyalty has also shown a significant fall, but the pattern of loyalty showed signs of Mittal and Lasser's (1998) satisfaction-loyalty gap. To support the findings from my research, a secondary data analysis was undertaken. This involved reviewing a number of business internet articles, taken from sources such as the ft. com and bbc. co. uk/business. The secondary research again showed that the offshoring trend has had damaging affects on UK customer satisfaction and loyalty. Further research that has been suggested includes carrying out a similar study to this one, but using a larger and more balanced sample to gain statistically significant results...|$|R

This research paper investigates how the strategic application of knowledge management within the <b>Call</b> <b>Centre</b> <b>customer</b> interface, through the support of senior management, can improve service delivery within Johannesburg Water. One-on-one interviews were conducted with selected <b>Call</b> <b>Centre</b> team leaders, and management from the <b>Call</b> <b>Centre</b> and the Operations department. Primary data was also extracted from the company‟s information management system (IMS). The Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) were observed within their work environment. Appendix A describes an example of the <b>Call</b> <b>Centre</b> <b>customer</b> service interface when a <b>customer</b> <b>calls</b> to log a complaint with Johannesburg Water, a Municipal Owned Entity (MOE). Knowledge management when applied as part of the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) strategy may be helpful in improving service delivery. <b>Call</b> <b>Centre</b> management has to invest in its people component of Knowledge Management (KM) strategy in order to have effective processes and effective technologies. Research conducted may be applicable and adapted to other public sector <b>Call</b> <b>Centres.</b> The study conducted indicates that senior management should focus on strengthening the “people” component of KM in order to achieve effective service delivery. Knowledge management gaps at the <b>Call</b> <b>Centre</b> were identified through the study which would be beneficial to <b>Call</b> <b>Centre</b> management in improving service effectiveness of the <b>Call</b> <b>Centre</b> for the organisatio...|$|R
