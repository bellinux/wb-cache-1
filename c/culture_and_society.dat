5|$|Mishmar HaEmek's {{cemetery}} {{is located}} in the outskirts of the kibbutz, next to the Palmach Cave. Members of the kibbutz from its past are buried in the cemetery, including five members of the Knesset, many known personalities from the fields of <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> <b>society</b> and a few high ranked military officers. Some of the people buried in the cemetery are not from the kibbutz but have some connection to it.|$|E
5|$|The gentry {{distinguished}} {{themselves in}} society through their intellectual and antiquarian pursuits, while {{the homes of}} prominent landholders attracted a variety of courtiers, including artisans, artists, educational tutors, and entertainers. Despite the disdain for trade, commerce and the merchant class exhibited by the highly cultured and elite exam-drafted scholar-officials, commercialism played {{a prominent role in}} Song <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> <b>society.</b> A scholar-official would be frowned upon by his peers if he pursued means of profiteering outside of his official salary; however, this did not stop many scholar-officials from managing business relations through the use of intermediary agents.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of Brazil, it was once {{considered}} probable that the Portuguese navigator Duarte Pacheco Pereira had made a voyage to the Brazilian coast in 1498. This belief has since been dismissed, however, {{and it is now}} thought that he voyaged to North America instead. There is more certain evidence that two Spaniards, Vicente Yáñez Pinzón and Diego de Lepe, traveled along the northern coast of Brazil between January and March 1500. Pinzón went from what is today Fortaleza (capital of the Brazilian state of Ceará) to the mouth of the Amazon River. There he encountered another Spanish expedition led by Lepe, which would reach as far as the Oyapock River in March. The reason Cabral is credited with having discovered Brazil, rather than the Spanish explorers, is because the visits by Pinzón and Lepe were cursory and had no lasting impact. Historians Capistrano de Abreu, Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen, Mário Barata and Hélio Vianna concur that the Spanish expeditions did not influence the development of what would become the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas—with a unique history, <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> <b>society</b> which sets it apart from the Hispanic-American societies which dominate the rest of the continent.|$|E
5|$|Michael Lynch and Richard Oram portray David {{as having}} little initial {{connection}} with the <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> <b>society</b> of the Scots; but both likewise argue that David became increasingly re-Gaelicised in the later stages of his reign. Whatever the case, David's claim to be heir to the Scottish kingdom was doubtful. David {{was the youngest of}} eight sons of the fifth from last king. Two more recent kings had produced sons. William fitz Duncan, son of King Donnchad II, and Máel Coluim, son of the last king Alexander, both preceded David in terms of the slowly emerging principles of primogeniture. However, unlike David, neither William nor Máel Coluim had the support of Henry. So when Alexander died in 1124, the aristocracy of Scotland could either accept David as King, or face war with both David and Henry I.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{value of}} the Sangam poems has been critically analysed by scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries. Sivaraja Pillay, a 20th-century historian, while constructing the genealogy of ancient Tamil kings from Sangam literature, insists that the Sangam poems show no similarities with ancient Puranic literature and medieval Tamil literature, both of which contain, according to him, fanciful myths and impossible legends. He feels that the Sangam literature is, for the most part, a plain unvarnished tale of the happenings of a by-gone age. Scholars like Dr. Venkata Subramanian, Dr. N. Subrahmanian, Dr. Sundararajan and J.K. Pillay concur with this view. Noted historian K.A.N. Sastri dates the presently available Sangam corpus to the early centuries of the Christian Era. He asserts that the picture drawn by the poets is in obedience to literary tradition and must {{have been based on}} solid foundation in the facts of contemporary life; he proceeds to use the Sangam literature to describe the government, <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> <b>society</b> of the early Pandyan kingdom. Kanakalatha Mukund, while describing the mercantile history of Tamilakam, points out that the heroic poetry in Sangam literature often described an ideal world rather than reality, but the basic facts are reliable and an important source of Tamil history. Her reasoning is that they have been supported by archaeological and numismatic evidence and the fact that similar vivid descriptions are found in works by different poets. Dr. Husaini relies on Sangam literature to describe the early Pandyan society and justifies his source by saying that some of the poetical works contain really trustworthy accounts of early Pandyan kings and present facts as they occurred, though they never throw much light about the chronology of their rule.|$|E

40|$|A {{main problem}} of any mediatization {{research}} {{is how to}} ground it in a practicable empirical approach. When we argue that within an ongoing mediatization process our <b>cultures</b> <b>and</b> <b>societies</b> transform, how can we investigate this in detail? What might be the intermediate concepts by which it becomes possible to research empirically in which way mediatization {{is related to the}} change of <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> <b>societies?</b> By posing questions like these, it becomes evident that media as such 2 ̆ 2 do 2 ̆ 2 nothing on their own. They become influential {{in the way that they}} 2 ̆ 2 alter 2 ̆ 2 the processes of symbolic interaction or, to be more precise: of communication. We are confronted with complex processes of interweaving in which certain human practices become institutionalized and reified in something that we call 2 ̆ 2 a medium 2 ̆ 2, which itself continuously changing 2 ̆ 2 alters 2 ̆ 2 our (communicative) construction of <b>cultures</b> <b>and</b> <b>societies.</b> If we want to analyze the mediatization of <b>cultures</b> <b>and</b> <b>societies</b> in such a way, we need an intermediate concept for a corresponding analysis. This chapter outlines the concept of 2 ̆ 2 communicative figurations 2 ̆ 2 as such an approach: This concept makes it possible to develop a practical, transmedial analysis of the changing communicative construction of mediatized <b>cultures</b> <b>and</b> <b>societies...</b>|$|R
