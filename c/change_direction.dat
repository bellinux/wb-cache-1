5|$|In {{a school}} of Pacific blue-eyes that is threatened, a few {{individuals}} accelerate and <b>change</b> <b>direction,</b> which initiates an escape wave that spreads through the whole cohort. Animals are known to dart in random directions and speeds as an escape response when threatened. Pacific blue-eyes on their own dart in this manner for up to ten seconds after being faced with a threat at close range. This period is briefer when faced with more distant threats or for fish in schools.|$|E
5|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{radioactive}} lanthanum were dispersed by the explosions; 254 tests were performed between 1944 and 1961. In 1948 two workers received radiation burns there. The experiments were generally performed {{when the wind}} blew to the north, but occasionally the wind would <b>change</b> <b>direction</b> in the early morning. In 1949 and 1950 the nuclear fallout from the tests was blown over parts of the housing area and a road; the radiation levels on the road occasionally reached 5-10mR/h and the road had to be closed for a while.|$|E
5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in November 1974. In the game, ducks fly {{one at a}} time across the screen, and the player shoots at them using a light gun attached to the game cabinet. The player gets three shots per duck; ducks <b>change</b> <b>direction</b> away from missed shots and fall {{to the bottom of the}} screen when hit. A screen overlay adds images of reeds and a tree branch, and an image of a duck is added to a row at the top of the screen whenever a duck is hit. Games continue until a time limit, set by the machine operator, is reached.|$|E

5|$|The bee-eaters are morphologically {{a fairly}} uniform group. They share many {{features}} with related Coraciiformes {{such as the}} kingfishers and rollers, being large-headed (although less so than their relatives), short-necked, brightly plumaged and short-legged. Their wings may be rounded or pointed, with the wing shape closely correlated with the species' preferred foraging habitat and migratory tendencies. Shorter, rounder wings are found on species that are sedentary and make typically short foraging flights in denser forests and reed-beds. Those with more elongated wings are more migratory. All the bee-eaters are highly aerial; they take off strongly from perches, fly directly without undulations, {{and are able to}} <b>change</b> <b>direction</b> quickly, although they rarely hover.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Świerczewski halted his force's {{advance on}} Dresden, and ordered it {{to pull back}} and secure the breach. On 22 April he ordered the 1st Armored Corps to <b>change</b> <b>direction,</b> retreat from Dresden and support the centre. The 8th Infantry Division was also recalled; however, the 9th {{remained}} near Dresden. For a while Świerczewski was out of communication with his superiors, including Marshal Konev. Konev also sent his chief of staff, General Ivan Yefimovich Petrov, and his chief of operations, General Vladimir Ivanovich Kostylev, {{to look at the}} situation. Petrov managed to re-establish communications, and left Kostylev in charge. Świerczewski was briefly relieved of his command for incompetence. To stabilize the situation, Konev ordered eight divisions from the Ukrainian Front to reinforce the Polish positions. Soviet 14th and Soviet 95th guards rifle divisions, as well as the Soviet 4th Guards Tank Corps, were ordered to attack toward Kamenz, Königswartha and Sdier to stop the Germans from advancing further north. The 2nd Air Army was also assigned to this theater.|$|E
5|$|Open water {{fish are}} usually {{streamlined}} like torpedoes to minimize turbulence {{as they move}} through the water. Reef fish live in a complex, relatively confined underwater landscape and for them, manoeuvrability {{is more important than}} speed, and many of them have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and <b>change</b> <b>direction.</b> Many have laterally compressed bodies (flattened from side to side) allowing them to fit into fissures and swim through narrow gaps; some use their pectoral fins for locomotion and others undulate their dorsal and anal fins. Some fish have grown dermal (skin) appendages for camouflage; the prickly leather-jacket is almost invisible among the seaweed it resembles and the tasselled scorpionfish invisibly lurks on the seabed ready to ambush prey. Some like the foureye butterflyfish have eyespots to startle or deceive, while others such as lionfish have aposematic coloration to warn that they are toxic or have venomous spines.|$|E

[...] When used in this context, it is similar to a gravitational slingshot; the difference is that a gravitational slingshot often increases or decreases spacecraft velocity and <b>changes</b> <b>direction,</b> while the gravity turn only <b>changes</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|R

40|$|Pseudomonas putida flagella were examined. Also, {{changes in}} motile {{behavior}} {{in response to}} chemoattractants were analyzed quantitatively by computer. Reversals in the rotation direction of bundles of polar flagella resulted in <b>changes</b> in swimming <b>direction.</b> Cells swimming in buffer <b>changed</b> <b>direction</b> once every 2 s on average, whereas cells exposed to the attractant benzoate <b>changed</b> <b>direction</b> an average of once every 10 s.

25|$|Because {{the cross}} product {{may also be}} a (true) vector, it may not <b>change</b> <b>direction</b> with a mirror image transformation. This happens, {{according}} to the above relationships, if one of the operands is a (true) vector and the other one is a pseudovector (e.g., the cross product of two vectors). For instance, a vector triple product involving three (true) vectors is a (true) vector.|$|E

On the island, the crosswalk may become diagonal, to direct the gaze of those crossing into exiting traffic.|$|E
25|$|The range {{covered by}} a hook move is the {{equivalent}} of two moves by a rook, or two moves by a bishop, depending on the piece. However, a hook move is functionally a single move: The piece cannot capture twice in one move, nor may it capture and then move on. It must stop before an intervening piece (unless it first changes direction to avoid it), and must stop when it captures, just like any other ranging piece. It can only <b>change</b> <b>direction</b> once per move.|$|E

Although not a complete success, the stage was able to <b>change</b> <b>direction</b> and make a controlled entry into the atmosphere. During the final landing burn, the ACS thrusters could not overcome an aerodynamically induced spin, and centrifugal force deprived the landing engine of fuel leading to early engine shutdown and a hard splashdown which destroyed the first stage.

40|$|<b>Change</b> of <b>direction</b> {{ability is}} an {{essential}} pre-requisite in team sports athletes. The Illinois <b>change</b> of <b>direction</b> test has been routinely used for testing <b>change</b> of <b>direction</b> ability in soccer players. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the Illinois <b>change</b> of <b>direction</b> test in young elite soccer players in terms of its reliability, usefulness and relationship with body size. A total of one hundred and ninety-four male, national-level soccer players were recruited. They were classified into four age groups (U- 8, U- 10, U- 12 and U- 14). Participants were tested using the Illinois <b>change</b> of <b>direction</b> test twice, and basic indices of body size were obtained. The Illinois <b>change</b> of <b>direction</b> scores showed high relative and absolute reliability in all age groups (all intraclass correlation coefficients were > 0. 91, and the standard error of measurement was 0. 05). Taking into account the test’s high reliability and the appropriate level of usefulness, these results might support the use of the Illinois <b>change</b> of <b>direction</b> test as a standard measure for quantifying <b>change</b> of <b>direction</b> ability in young soccer players...|$|R
