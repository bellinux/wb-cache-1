25|$|Much {{the same}} way that the {{influential}} Duke Ellington matched his scores to the unique abilities of his performers, Hefti was able to take advantage of the same kind of 'fine-tuning' to bring out the best of the talents of the Basie band.

25|$|The {{earliest}} known blazon {{from this}} period states that the arms of Finland represents A crowned lion of gold holding a sword in the right forepaw and trampling with both hindpaws on a Russian sabre (ryssesabel), surrounded by nine silver roses in a red field, over the shield a golden crown with a red cap. As both King Gustavus I and his son, John III, were involved in lengthy wars with Russia, it should <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> this was a central element {{in the arms of}} both the Grand Duchy of Finland, and in that of the coat of arms of the Finnish province of Karelia (Figure 6), which symbolizes the struggle between East and West.|$|E

25|$|Several reasons can {{be cited}} {{as to why}} the {{professional}} middle class is so influential. One is that journalists, commentators, writers, professors, economists, and political scientists, who are essential in shaping public opinion, are almost exclusively members of the professional middle class. Considering the overwhelming presence of professional middle-class persons in post secondary education, another essential instrument in regards to shaping public opinion, it should <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> the lifestyle exclusive to this quasi-elite has become indicative of the American mainstream itself. In addition to setting trends, the professional middle class also holds occupations which include managerial duties, meaning that middle-class professionals spend much of their work-life directing others and conceptualizing the workday for the average worker.|$|E
500|$|According to Gaga the Grammy {{performance}} {{was inspired by}} many things, including Gregorian music, Alvin Ailey dance moves and Martha Graham's dance energy. On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno she explained that Smith inspired her to [...] "whip my hair {{back and forth on}} stage," [...] referring to Smith's similar named song. Gaga continued that the incubating vessel was meant to signify an artistic statement of birthing a new race with no prejudice. The idea occurred to her when she was in Amsterdam on her tour bus, and was thinking about birth and embryos. She had thought to herself, [...] "Gosh, the thing I hate most about doing award shows is, it can be [...] distracting... I want to exist only for my fans and for the stage. I don't want to exist in this machine or this circus that is the industry. I wish I could be encapsulated for three days and just think only about my performance, think only about the album, think only about the future of my fans. So that's what I did." [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV felt that the {{performance was}} [...] "surprisingly" [...] sparse compared to Gaga's previous [...] "over-the-top" [...] endeavors. Soraya Roberts from New York Daily News was disappointed with the [...] "highly expected" [...] performance, feeling that it had copied Madonna and her Blond Ambition World Tour choreography. Jason Lipscultz from Billboard described the performance as [...] "spirited", and felt that Gaga's appearance inside the egg was one of the memorable moments of the Grammy Awards. Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly praised the performance saying that although there were definite influences of Madonna in it, the performance was {{one of the highlights of}} the show. Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone concurred that [...] "It should <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> Lady Gaga's performance of her new single 'Born This Way' was the evening's most visually stunning and bizarre spectacle." ...|$|E

McCormick, {{adds to the}} above {{discussion}} by arguing against {{the way in which}} the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education is used in the creation of U.S. News rankings. The problem, he argues, with this use is that there is [...] "no basis for inferring national versus regional focus, because it’s not a factor in the classification criteria. So it should <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> the national and regional lists contain a great many inconsistencies and bizarre placements [...] By continuing to rely on the Carnegie Classification, they avoid the tough job of defining their terms." ...|$|E
2500|$|But {{the reason}} for Maroto's leaving Catalonia was not the {{opposition}} of the leading Catalans, but his belief {{that he had been}} betrayed in not having received the resources he had counted on when he left Navarre. So, after submitting to the Intendant Díaz de Labandero a series of petitions for armaments and uniforms that were totally impossible to fulfill, Maroto abandoned Catalonia 5 October on the pretext of going to see Don Carlos to notify him of the true situation of the war in that territory, thereby fulfilling [...] "my intent of resigning the command of the Catalan forces… it not being my character to carry on a disastrous life with no higher dignity than that of a captain of brigands". It should <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> the Catalans despised the man who had abandoned them, and that the court of Don Carlos did not look favorably on a man who appeared not to have exerted all possible force to achieve his assigned task.|$|E

[...] Website Rap-Up praised the remix for [...] "add an explosive verse to the bombastic banger." [...] Brennan Carley of Spin enjoyed the track, claiming that Azalea [...] "stomps in with some much stronger {{words for the}} haters than the ones Taylor Swift lobbed on 'Shake It Off'." [...] Nolan Feeney of Time noted that Azalea appearance is now [...] "thankfully on hand to inject the song with a little extra stuffing." [...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News wrote that, musically, [...] "the new take has more oopmh, courtesy of Azalea's rapid flow, {{not to mention the}} added story line of J. Lo playing butt-mentor to the new curvy flavor of the month." [...] However, Farber also noted that [...] "even in the remix, the song won't be as fetching to most fans as the women's figures. It has a fairly routine club beat, and Lopez' vocal remains pale and thin." ...|$|E

Henry Adaso of About.com states [...] "Arguably T.I.'s worst outing yet, No Mercy relies on gruesomely listless party tunes {{and the occasional}} whining" [...] and stating [...] "The production on No Mercy is painfully generic for a rapper once known for rocking {{some of the best}} beats money can buy". AllMusic writer Andy Kellman described it as [...] "a career low point for all involved" [...] however he states [...] "There's a sense that he'll regain focus once his legal matters settle". Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club states [...] "As is the case with 2Pac, it's difficult to separate the ongoing crime drama/soap opera of T.I.'s life from the music he creates. So it should <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>that</b> No Mercy, the superstar's latest post-and-pre-prison-stint album, reflects the life lessons and soul-searching that come with extended jail time at the height of a superstar's fame". Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe noted that [...] "throughout this disc there's an unsettling celebration of the untamed life without any reflection on the consequences T.I. often laments". Entertainment Weeklys Brad Wete noted that [...] "The self-proclaimed King of the South addresses his troubles on several tracks while on others he remains unrepentant, though: On Get Back Up, he arrogantly apologizes for being human rather than for his crimes" [...] Wete ended the review by stating [...] "That crown must be getting heavy".|$|E
