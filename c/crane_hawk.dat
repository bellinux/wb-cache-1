50|$|The <b>crane</b> <b>hawk</b> (Geranospiza caerulescens) is {{a species}} of bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. It is {{monotypic}} within the genus Geranospiza.|$|E
50|$|Ictinia is near-basal, {{after the}} Old-World genus Butastur. Rostrhamus and Helicolestes form a clade with the black-collared hawk (Busarellus) and the <b>crane</b> <b>hawk</b> (Geranospiza).|$|E
50|$|Nowhere is the <b>Crane</b> <b>Hawk</b> {{particularly}} common, but it {{is still}} widely distributed. However, it is considered threatened in Mexico, endangered in El Salvador, and at low risk in Argentina.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crane</b> <b>Hawks</b> {{occur in}} {{tropical}} lowlands {{at the edge}} of forests and are almost always closely associated with water. It is found in Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad, Uruguay, and Venezuela. They are an irruptive and local migrant, probably moving in response to changing water conditions.|$|R
50|$|Birds {{including}} {{different species}} of <b>Cranes,</b> Doves, <b>Hawks,</b> Fowls, Quails etc. {{and a variety of}} aquatic plants create a wonderful scene here in the winter and spring.|$|R
50|$|The area {{surrounding}} Campbell's ledge is {{teeming with}} wildlife. Inhabiting {{the area are}} white tailed deer, foxes, coyote, turkey, bear, ducks, geese, <b>cranes,</b> rabbits, <b>hawks</b> and a few species of snakes, among others.|$|R
50|$|The <b>crane</b> <b>hawk</b> {{used to be}} {{many species}} that were {{recently}} lumped into one. Those species are now designated as subspecies. Color varies clinally, though, {{and it is now}} commonly accepted that they comprise one species. There are also two species of harrier-hawks in Africa of the genus Polyboroides that, while they are morphologically and behaviorally similar, are not very closely related. They serve as a good example of convergent evolution.|$|E
50|$|The {{subfamily}} Circinae {{has traditionally}} included the genera Polyboroides and Geranospiza which include three species - the Madagascar harrier-hawk, (Polyboroides radiatus), the African harrier-hawk, (Polyboroides typus) and the <b>crane</b> <b>hawk,</b> (Geranospiza caerulescens). This may however {{not be a}} valid subfamily as the monophyletic genus Circus is nested within the Accipiter groups while the other two genera are non-monophyletic and {{are part of the}} larger Buteonine clade. Many species in the genus Circus show very low diversity in their mitochondrial DNA due perhaps due to extreme drops in their populations. They are prone to fluctuations with varying prey densities.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Crane</b> <b>Hawk</b> (Geranospiza caerulescens) is a lanky hawk of {{the forests}} and swampy {{woodlands}} of tropical America. Deep wing beats reminiscent of a large heron, interspersed with short sails on slightly arched wings, lethargically carry the <b>Crane</b> <b>Hawk</b> above the forest 2 ̆ 7 s humid penumbra. Its dark form is interrupted {{by a pair of}} bright white tail bands and a diagnostic white crescent across the base of the primary flight feathers. Rarely soaring or flying high above the canopy, except during courtship or territorial displays, these astute predators rely less on speed of flight to secure prey than on a methodical reconnaissance of their large, diverse territories. Using their long legs and unusually flexible intertarsal joints, these hawks forage largely by reaching within nooks and crannies for hidden pry. The brilliant reddish-orange glow of their long legs haunts the daylight dreams of roosting nocturnal animals throughout all strata of the moist lowland forest. In reality, nary a small animal is safe from this active and agile hunter. As either a silent forest skulker or an adroit cavity snatcher, the <b>Crane</b> <b>Hawk</b> uses an array of foraging styles to capture a wide variety of prey types. The evolution of several anatomical features such as long legs, a highly flexible intertarsal joint, scutellate tarsi, and miniature outer toes facilitate this generalized hunting repertoire and contribute to a rather catholic diet. Although the <b>Crane</b> <b>Hawk</b> is a dietary generalist, it seems to be found most commonly near water in forested habitat, and less so in remnant or gallery forests. Inconspicuous flight behavior and dark plumage make the <b>Crane</b> <b>Hawk</b> an elusive research subject. I studied the breeding ecology of Crane Hawks in Tikal National Park, Petén, Guatemala, from 1993 - 1995. Breeding biology, adult and nestling behavior, and home ranges of Crane Hawks in Tikal are presented in Chapter 1. I located and recorded data on the breeding biology of 14 breeding pairs. I documented productivity at 12 nesting attempts and studied behavior during the incubation, nestling, and post-fledging periods. Nesting was relatively synchronous among pairs, with egg laying and hatching coinciding with the dry season, and young fledging {{at the onset of the}} rainy season. Crane Hawks had relatively high reoccupancy of nest sites, often using alternative nest sites in the same general area in consecutive years. Clutches ranged from 1 - 2 eggs, and mean clutch size was 1. 7 ± 0. 5 eggs. Eighty percent of eggs hatched, and 50...|$|E

50|$|The habitat {{diversity}} at Saint John's {{allows for}} a great diversity of wildlife as well. Water birds, birds of prey, shore birds, warblers, and many other kinds of birds can be found here, including many rare species such as sandhill <b>cranes,</b> red-shouldered <b>hawks,</b> cerulean warblers, and others.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{tree species}} include {{lodgepole}} pine, Engelmann spruce, Douglas-fir, subalpine fir, aspen and whitebark pine. Willows, grasses and sagebrush are {{found on the}} lower altitudes, while above the timberline alpine meadows are common. Threatened and endangered species found within the forest boundaries include grizzly bears, wolf, black-footed ferret and peregrine falcon. Most of the mammals {{that existed in the}} region prior to European settlement can still be found here. Elk, moose, mule deer, bighorn sheep, bison, coyote, marmot, pronghorn, and cougar are {{but a few of the}} 75 species of mammals known to exist in the forest. Four subspecies of cutthroat trout also are found here including the Snake River cutthroat trout. 355 species of birds have been sighted including bald eagles, trumpeter swans, sandhill <b>cranes,</b> <b>hawks,</b> and Clark's nutcrackers.|$|R
40|$|The avian family Accipitridae {{includes}} 240 {{species and}} 60 genera of hawks, eagles, Old World vultures, kites, accipiters, goshawks and harriers. Phylogeny for Accipitridae {{has been difficult}} to resolve with morphological data such that non-monophyly of subfamilies and genera was suspected. This study used mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data to resolve the phylogeny for Accipitridae taxa. Extensive sampling of nominal species and genera (75 % of all species and 97 % of genera) identified non-monophyly for most genera and subfamilies/subgroups and some species. 	Monophyly of sea eagles (Haliaeetinae), booted eagles (Aquilinae), Aegypinae Old World Vultures, goshawks (Melieraxinae) and harriers (Circinae) was supported; however, none of the kite subfamilies (Milvinae, Perninae and Elaninae), Accipiters (Accipitrinae), harpy eagles (Harpiinae) and snake eagles (Circaetinae) formed monophyletic groups. Specialized limb morphology relating to predation on cavity-nesting species shared by the gymnogene (Polyboroides typus) and the <b>Crane</b> <b>Hawk</b> (Geranospiza caerulescens) is an example of convergent evolution as the two species were not closely related. 	The nominal genera Buteo, Buteogallus, Accipiter, Circaetus, Hieraaetus, Spizaetus, Aquila, Haliaeetus and Leucopternis were not monophyletic. Investigations at or within the level of species revealed non-monophyly for Hieraaetus fasciatus and H. morphnoides, supporting recognition of H. spilogaster and H. weiskeii as distinct species. Complicated and non-monophyletic relationships among the subspecies of Leucopternis albicollis and L. occidentalis require further investigation to resolve taxonomic nomenclature. Such extensive non-phylogenetic taxonomy at multiple levels emphasizes the need for major taxonomic revision within the Accipitridae. 	Investigations of genetic diversity and population structure within the harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) found moderate to high levels of genetic diversity with 417 bases of the mitochondrial control region from 66 harpy eagles. There was no evidence of complete barriers to historical gene flow, however significant genetic differentiation between harpy eagles from Central America and South America was found. Estimates of gene flow were asymmetric with the vast majority of migration in the direction from Central America into South America, suggesting that habitat reduction and fragmentation in Central America may have forced southern migration. Conservation strategies for harpy eagles should aim to maintain gene flow between southern Central America and northern South America...|$|E
50|$|Tibet's {{elevation}} {{and lack}} of precipitation produces an alpine tundra environment, which reduces species diversity. Tibet hosts species of wolf, snow leopard, wild yak, wild donkey, <b>cranes,</b> vultures, <b>hawks,</b> geese, snakes, and buffalo. One notable animal is the high-altitude jumping spider, that can live at elevations of over 6500 m.|$|R
50|$|There are no dams or {{man-made}} obstructions to {{the natural}} flow of water between the hydroelectric dam just north of Sauk City and {{the confluence of the}} Wisconsin and the Mississippi. This long stretch of free-flowing river provides important natural habitats for a variety of wildlife, including white-tail deer, otter, beaver, turtles, sandhill <b>cranes,</b> eagles, <b>hawks,</b> and a variety of fish species.|$|R
50|$|Alstermo {{also has}} tennis courts, a {{football}} stadium, a sports hall and a shooting-range. In the winter, skiing and skating are very popular. Elk, deer, fox, badger, marten, mink, {{and a host}} of other animals live in the dark woods surrounding Alstermo. It is also common to see <b>cranes,</b> herons, <b>hawks,</b> and buzzards. Fish such as pike, perch, roach, and burbot are prevalent in the waters of the Alster River.|$|R
50|$|Adaptation to high {{altitude}} has fascinated ornithologists for decades, {{but only a}} small proportion of high-altitude species have been studied. In Tibet, few birds are found (28 endemic species), including <b>cranes,</b> vultures, <b>hawks,</b> jays and geese.The Andes is quite rich in bird diversity. The Andean condor, the largest bird {{of its kind in the}} Western Hemisphere, occurs throughout much of the Andes but generally in very low densities; species of tinamous (notably members of the genus Nothoprocta), Andean goose, giant coot, Andean flicker, diademed sandpiper-plover, miners, sierra-finches and diuca-finches are also found in the highlands.|$|R
6000|$|While Egyptian myth, {{religion}} and ritual is thus {{connected with the}} beliefs of the lower races, the animal-worship presents yet another point of contact. Not only were beasts locally adored, but gods were thought of and represented {{in the shape of}} various different beasts. How did the evolution work its way? what is the connection between a lofty spiritual conception, as of Ammon Ra, the lord of righteousness, and Osiris, judge of the dead, and bulls, rams, wolves, <b>cranes,</b> <b>hawks,</b> and so forth? Osiris especially had quite a collection of bestial heads, and appeared in divers bestial forms.* The bull Hapi [...] "was a fair and beautiful image of the soul of Osiris," [...] in late ritual.** We have read a hymn in which he is saluted as a ram. He also [...] "taketh the character of the god Bennu, with the head of a crane," [...] and as Sokar Osiris has the head of a hawk.*** These phenomena could not but occur, in the long course of time, when political expediency, in Egypt, urged the recognition of the identity of various local deities. In the same way [...] "Ammon Ra, like most of the gods, frequently took the character of other deities, as Khem, Ra and Chnumis, and even the attributes of Osiris [...] ".**** ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{there are}} quaint laws about hunting; and {{damage caused by}} wild beasts caught in snares or brought to bay. A wounded stag belongs {{to the man who}} has wounded it for twenty-four hours: but after that to anyone. Tame deer, it is observable, are kept; and to kill a doe or fawn costs 6s., to kill a buck, 12s. Tame <b>hawks,</b> <b>cranes,</b> and swans, if taken in snares, cost 6s. But any man may take flying hawks out of his neighbour's wood, but not out of the Gaias Regis, the king's gehage, haies, hedges, or {{enclosed}} parks.|$|R
