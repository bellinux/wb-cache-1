40|$|To use {{graphics}} efficiently in {{an automatic}} report generation system, {{one has to}} model messages and how they pass from the writer (intention) to the reader (interpretation). This paper describes PostGraphe a system which generates a report integrating graphics and text from a set of writer's intentions. The system is given the data in tabular form as might {{be found in a}} spreadsheet; also input is a declaration of the types of values in the columns of the table. The user then indicates the intentions to be conveyed in the graphics (e. g. compare two variables or show the evolution of a set of variables) and the system generates a report in L A T E X with the appropriate PostScript graphic files. PostGraphe uses the same information to generate the accompanying text that helps the reader to focus on the important points of the graphics. We also describe how these ideas have been embedded to create a new <b>Chart</b> <b>Wizard</b> for Microsoft Excel. 1 Introduction: important factors in the generati [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Raster graphic ampelometric {{software}} was not exclusively {{developed for the}} estimation of leaf area, {{but also for the}} characterization of grapevine (Viti vinifera L.) leaves. The {{software was}} written in C-Hprogramming language, using the C- 1 - 1 - Builder 2007 for Windows 95 -XP and Linux operation systems. It handles desktop-scanned images. On the image analysed with the GRA. LE. D., the user has to determine 11 points. These points are then connected and the distances between them calculated. The GRA. LE. D. software supports standard ampelometric measurements such as leaf area, angles between the veins and lengths of the veins. These measurements are recorded by the software and exported into plain ASCII text files for single or multiple samples. Twenty-two biometric data points of each leaf are identified by the GRA. LE. D. It presents the opportunity to statistically analyse experimental data, allows comparison of cultivars and enables graphic reconstruction of leaves using the Microsoft Excel <b>Chart</b> <b>Wizard.</b> The GRA. LE. D. was thoroughly calibrated and compared to other widely used instruments and methods such as photo-gravimetry, LiCor L 0100, WinDIAS 2. 0 and ImageTool. By comparison, the GRA. LE. D. presented the most accurate measurements of leaf area, but the LiCor L 0100 and the WinDIAS 2. 0 were faster, while the photo-gravimetric method proved to be the most time-consuming. The WinDIAS 2. 0 instrument was the least reliable. The GRA. LE. D. is uncomplicated, user-friendly, accurate, consistent, reliable and has wide practical application...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} numeric data in any areas (marketing, research, communication, etc.) necessarily {{involves the use}} of charts that {{have to be able to}} clearly show the results of its processing. The tools must be then easy to use, intuitive, and, above all, provide a wide range of possible representations for the same quantitative numerical result. At the same time the users are requested to make an effort in having a clear idea about what they want to get from these tools, and how, on the basis of the data they have. This situation of constant activity promotes not only the evolution of web-based visualization tools, but also the emergence of new methods of representation, through the cognitive contribution of all of the users. The <b>Chart</b> <b>Wizard</b> tries to be a first attempt at devising a method which may be applied to the most modern consultation and information tools (tablet, mobile device, etc.) and, at the same time, may give the user an easy access to very technical topics. At the basis of the choice of the suggested tools there is a clear intention of limiting the possible options to web-based softwares only. The proliferation of web platforms that offer the possibility of creating graphical and high-quality statistical representations is enough to allow almost anyone to get basic and complex charts with just a few clicks. Moreover, the functioning of these web tools often rely on data-entry interfaces also web-based and easy to use...|$|E
40|$|This study {{concerns}} the {{creative use of}} MS Excel {{in teaching and learning}} chemistry in Malaysian secondary schools and universities. It is used to explain, explore and understand chemical concepts. Topics such as chemical kinetics, gas compressibility, distribution of molecular speed, period three elements, qualitative analysis, spectroscopy and chemical equilibrium were chosen from Form Six and first/second year university syllabus as examples. For the “qualitative analysis” workbook, a set of videos showing the reactions described are also provided to give the ‘intuitive feel’ of the experiments described in the worksheets. Simple functions in Excel such as ‘Active X’ control tool box, simple macro, <b>chart</b> <b>wizard,</b> hyperlink function and some built in mathematical functions were used extensively in creating the workbooks. These workbooks have provided a stimulative and interesting methodology in learning chemistry. It could offer great benefits to teachers and students in teaching and learning of the said topics. The chemical kinetics workbooks were tried out in secondary schools and the spectroscopy workbook was brought to local universities as field studies. Opinion survey of 612 students from 12 different secondary schools from three states in Malaysia and 68 undergraduate students from various local universities indicated that students were very satisfied with the use of Excel in teaching and learning of chemistry. Data collected were analyzed with descriptive statistics to examine the perception of the respondents and inferential statistics were used to observe the difference in perception between gender and races. The results of the field study showed that most students (> 93...|$|E
40|$|M. A. OBJECTIVE Littering {{has become}} a serious problem in most urban areas of South Africa, and Johannesburg and Pretoria are no exceptions. Urban spaces are used for {{throwing}} away of everything from cigarette butts to shopping bags, right-through to discarded furniture. Pretoria and Johannesburg Central Business Districts are therefore used to illustrate this problem. The purpose of this research project is to study the litter problem in central Pretoria and compare its findings {{with that of a}} similar study conducted for Johannesburg. The study will further validate the results of Johannesburg and thereafter determine the practicality of Johannesburg's recommendations for both cities {{to address the problem of}} littering. The aims of the study are to determine attitudes of the general public in central Pretoria towards littering, evaluate the physical conditions in terms of litter in the immediate surroundings, as well as to make a comparative analysis between the findings of the Pretoria project and that of Johannesburg (Appendix A). RESEARCH METHOD The research was conducted by means of a supervised survey. The survey method was preceded by a preliminary study in the CBD of Pretoria. This method was used to locate taxi ranks as well as to assess provision and conditions of street waste and litterbins. Primary data were collected by using three different sets of questionnaires. The survey was conducted on a sample population of 652, which was randomly selected. Microsoft Excel software package was used in the data analysis, and <b>Chart</b> <b>wizard</b> to create diagrams. RESULTS Litter was found to be a serious and growing problem in both cities. Litter conditions were found to be at unacceptable levels and there is reason to believe that it will deteriorate even further if not given urgent and proper attention by decision-makers. A number of disciplinary actions were suggested, but the author's opinion is that those actions should be followed by disciplining litterbugs. The comparative analysis shows that the findings of both projects are almost identical and are in concurrence with each other. Moreover, the findings show that the two cities suffer from a similar problem with varying degree. The recommendations of the Johannesburg study are thus considered to be valid and practical for the Pretoria study as well...|$|E
