50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that a diet high in dairy {{decreases}} total body fat. This occurs because a high amount of dietary calcium increases {{the amount of energy}} and fat excreted from the body.

In these studies, a high calcium intake is considered 2300 mg and a low calcium intake is considered 700 mg. A possible explanation to this phenomenon is that high intakes of calcium cause <b>calcium</b> <b>soap</b> formation and/ or binding of bile acids in the intestine.

In Expt 1 four dry cows were fed Italian {{ryegrass}} hay and concentrate as basal diet (BD). Treatments were BD, BD + Ca-FA-l (300 g), BD + Ca-FA-l (600 g) or BD + Ca-FA- 2 (600 g). In Expt 2 four lactating cows were fed bahiagrass hay and concentrates {{with or without}} the Ca-F A- 2 supplements (500 g). In Expt 1 {{there were no significant differences}} in NDF digestibility by feeding Ca-F A. Methane production per dry matter intake (DMI) in dry cows tended to decrease about 7 - 9 % (17 - 23 litres/day) by feeding Ca-F A but no effects of degree of saturation and amount of Ca-F A fed were observed. In Expt 2 DMI and digestibilities of dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) were not affected by feeding Ca-FA. Methane suppression in lactating cows was about 4 % (22 litres/day/kg DMI). From the above results, it is concluded that feeding 300 - 600 g/day of Ca-F A is effective in suppressing methane production without reduction of productivity.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} foam {{stability in the}} presence of model nonpolar oils and their mixtures with oleic acid was conducted for two commonly used surfactants (anionic and nonionic) under neutral and alkaline conditions with different amounts of dissolved calcium. In some cases insoluble <b>calcium</b> <b>soap</b> or microemulsions formed in situ. Measurements of the rate of collapse of a foam column were supplemented by microscopic observations of individual foam and "pseudoemulsion" films and by measurement of equilibrium and dynamic surface and interfacial tensions. In the absence of <b>calcium</b> <b>soap</b> use of equilibrium values of conventional entry E, spreading S, and bridging B coefficients was adequate to explain the effect of oils on stability of foams containing the nonionic surfactant. For the anionic surfactant E must be modified to account for electrostatic repulsion in the pseudoemulsion film. <b>Calcium</b> <b>soap</b> particles at the oil-water interface facilitate entry of oil drops and the associated bridging of foam films or Plateau borders, producing a substantial antifoam effect. 	When this synergistic effect occurs, conventional values of E govern oil entry. In some cases for oils that were mixtures of triolein and oleic acid foam is unstable during foam formation and initial foam drainage but stable at later times, behavior which is explained by calculating transient values of E, S, and B. Addition of n-dodecanol produced significant stabilization of foams of the anionic surfactant containing dispersed oil drops both when <b>calcium</b> <b>soap</b> was present and when high levels of calcium had destabilized the foam at neutral pH. ESB theory proved useful in predicting this effect. An amine oxide surfactant was less effective as a foam booster. In the absence of oil, <b>calcium</b> <b>soap</b> particles can destabilize foams of both surfactants. A model for predicting the precipitation boundary including the enhancement of calcium content in the electrical double layers of surfactant micelles yielded results in agreement with experiment. Foam was less stable while precipitation was occurring (hours) than at equilibrium, perhaps because calcium oleate, which initially formed at the interfaces, was extracted as oleate concentration decreased to its equilibrium value...|$|E

No differences were found in milk, protein, and lactose yields, but fat yield and milk fat content were greater in treatments with added fat (CaOFA and OO). Content of short- and medium-chain fatty acids in milk fat was greater for control treatment than for the other 2 groups, the yield of these fatty acids being similar for all 3 diets, except that of C 12 : 0, which was greater for the control treatment. Content and yield of C 18 : 0 and isomers of C 18 : 1 others than oleic acid were greater in milk from the CaOFA diet than from the other 2 diets. Oleic acid content and yield were greater in milk after OO treatment (23. 9 % and 16. 8 g/d, respectively), intermediate after CaOFA treatment (19. 2 % and 13. 8 g/d, respectively), and lower after control diet (10. 7 % and 6. 52 g/d, respectively).

The absorption of calcium was inversely correlated with the chain length of the fatty acid varying from 1 % for Ca-stearate to 60 % for Ca-hexanoate. Increasing the degree of unsaturation of the fatty acid was accompanied by increased calcium absorption. The availability of calcium for absorption from the soaps was correlated with their solubility in 1 % aqueous Na-tauroglycocholate. The percentages of calcium as soap in the small intestine and the faeces after intragastric administration of calcium and fats were similar, {{which suggests that the}} faecal content of calcium soaps is an index of intestinal soap formation. Soap formation was negligible when CaCl 2 was given with tristearate, triolaeate, or tridecanoate and no depression of calcium absorption was observed. Calcium absorption was markedly impaired by the addition of phosphates at a Ca/P ratio of 1 : 1 irrespective of the presence of neutral fats. Stearic acid resulted in significant soap formation and reduced calcium absorption. The degree of Ca-soap formation and the inhibition of calcium absorption were well correlated. The results suggest that, although <b>calcium</b> <b>soap</b> formation may markedly depress calcium absorption in the rat, no significant soap formation takes place when fats are given in the form of triglycerides...|$|E
3000|$|The main {{assumption}} {{of the theory of}} fresco is that this technique can only correspond to fresco painting [64]. However, this statement is not particularly rigorous, as it does not consider other painting techniques which are water-sensitive when applied on a dry support and which become water-resistant when applied on a damp rendering, {{as is the case with}} emulsified wax paint. Applied on a dry support, this type of paint remains water sensitive for a long time unless varnished. However, when applied on a fresh lime plaster, its soap content reacts with the lime quickly transforming it into an insoluble <b>calcium</b> <b>soap</b> and making the paint water-resistant. 8 [...]...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{heterogeneous}} catalyst for transesterification of triacylglycerols (TAG) to methyl esters of fatty acids (FAME) by methanol enables its simple isolation from the reaction mixture and yields glycerol (G) of a good quality. Calcium oxide {{appears to be a}} promising heterogeneous catalyst. The paper presents the results of transesterification obtained from two samples containing CaO from two different producers. The first tested CaO exhibits high catalytic activity with high conversion> 97 % of TAG to FAME, while the second tested CaO exhibits low conversion of only 20 %. In the case of catalytic active CaO is the content of G in the polar phase higher than 97 %, but low fraction of <b>calcium</b> <b>soaps</b> remains in the ester phase. X-ray diffraction analysis, IR spectra and determination of specific surfaces and of the pore distribution pointed to differences of both tested CaO...|$|R

5|$|The {{production}} {{and use of}} lithium underwent several drastic changes in history. The first major application of lithium was in high-temperature lithium greases for aircraft engines and similar applications in World War II and shortly after. This use {{was supported by the}} fact that lithium-based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps, and are less corrosive than <b>calcium</b> based <b>soaps.</b> The small demand for lithium soaps and lubricating greases was supported by several small mining operations, mostly in the US.|$|R
