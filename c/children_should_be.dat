In an elegy composed by him {{over the loss of}} a relative, he combines his grief with observations on the ephemerality of this life: Even on al-Maʿarri's epitaph, he wanted it written that his life was a wrong done by his father and not one that was done by himself.|$|E

Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him {{with a list of}} 348 words that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words. However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.|$|E
5|$|Harris, then host of Rolf's Cartoon Time, {{approached}} the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and the Tavistock Clinic with his idea {{about making a}} film on child sexual abuse. Both organisations were receptive. Harris had previous connections with the NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League of Pity, and a NSPCC official suggested that he use child actors in Kids Can Say No! Harris approached director Jessica Skippon, {{with whom he had}} made a film about water safety, and said that he wanted to make Kids Can Say No! to protect children. Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that <b>children</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> told about sexual abuse.|$|E

5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of <b>children</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> assumed to be covered as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E
5|$|The Parliamentary Elections Act and Presidential Elections Act {{regulate}} {{the exercise of}} the vote and set out the procedures for parliamentary and presidential elections in Singapore.

25|$|There {{has been}} a huge {{growth in the number of}} privately owned and {{operated}} English immersion preschools in Taiwan since 1999. These English immersion preschools generally employ native English speaking teachers to teach the whole preschool curriculum in an ‘English only’ environment. The legality of these types of schools has been called into question on many occasions, yet they continue to prosper. Some members of Taiwanese society have raised concerns as to whether local <b>children</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> placed in English immersion environments at such a young age, and have raised fears that the students abilities in their mother language may suffer as a result. The debate continues, but at the present time, the market for English Immersion Preschools continues to grow.|$|E

This was done in response to concerned parents, alarmed by the evidence showing increased incidence of thyroid cancer among children after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. The project was done by the Medical University of Fukushima. The results of the tests will be mailed to the children within a month.

25|$|LGBT {{movements}} are opposed {{by a variety}} of individuals and organizations. Some social conservatives believe that all sexual relationships with people other than an opposite-sex spouse undermine the traditional family and that <b>children</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> reared in homes with both a father and a mother. Some opponents of gay rights say that such rights may conflict with individuals' freedom of speech, religious freedoms in the workplace, the ability to run churches, charitable organizations and other religious organizations in accordance with one's religious views, and that the acceptance of homosexual relationships by religious organizations might be forced through threatening to remove the tax-exempt status of churches whose views do not align with those of the government. Some critics charge that political correctness has led to the association of sex between males and HIV being downplayed.|$|E
25|$|The Perfectionist movement, led by John Humphrey Noyes, {{founded the}} utopian Oneida Community in 1848 with fifty-one devotees, in Oneida, New York. Noyes {{believed}} {{that the act of}} final conversion led to absolute and complete release from sin. The Onedia Community believed in the abolition of marriage or monogamous relationships and that sex should be free to whoever consented to it. As opposed to 20th century social movements such as the Sexual Revolution of the 1960s, the Onedians did not seek consequence-free sex for mere pleasure, but believed that, because the logical outcome of intercourse was pregnancy, that raising <b>children</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a communal responsibility. After the original founders died or became elderly, their children rejected the concept of free love and returned to traditional family models. Transforming into a joint-stock company, Oneida thrived for many years and continues today as a silverware company.|$|E

25|$|Children in {{the three-year}} old age group {{are more likely}} to have a {{fatality}} because it is the age where positioning is crucial. In some countries, children transition from facing the rear of the car to facing the front at this age. A study was done on restraints and positioning of three-year olds. It was concluded that being restrained and in the front seat has a lower fatality rate than children positioned in the back seat but not restrained. The safety results indicated that <b>children</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> placed in the back seat and restrained. It also suggests that restraints have a bigger impact on safety than seating positions. A lap belt used on children will not provide as much safety as it would for an adult, due to the flexibility of children. An adult seatbelt could do more harm to a child than good, which is why children should properly be utilizing the Child Restraint System instead. This system includes a booster seat and a proper belt that fits the child's criteria including age, weight and height.|$|E
25|$|Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action urges at Section II para 47, {{all nations}} to {{undertake}} measures {{to the maximum}} extent of their available resources, {{with the support of}} international cooperation, to achieve the goals in the World Summit Plan of Action. And calls on States to integrate the Convention on the Rights of the Child into their national action plans. By means of these national action plans and through international efforts, particular priority should be placed on reducing infant and maternal mortality rates, reducing malnutrition and illiteracy rates and providing access to safe drinking water and basic education. Whenever so called for, national plans of action should be devised to combat devastating emergencies resulting from natural disasters and armed conflicts and the equally grave problem of children in extreme poverty. Further para 48 urges all states, with the support of international cooperation, to address the acute problem of children under especially difficult circumstances. Exploitation and abuse of <b>children</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> actively combated, including by addressing their root causes. Effective measures are required against female infanticide, harmful child labour, sale of children and organs, child prostitution, child pornography, as well as other forms of sexual abuse. This gave an influence to adoptions of Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after World War II, {{a second}} {{approach}} to drug therapy of cancer began. Sidney Farber, a pathologist at Harvard Medical School, studied {{the effects of}} folic acid on leukemia patients. Folic acid, a vitamin crucial for DNA metabolism (he {{did not know the}} significance of DNA at that time), had been discovered by Lucy Wills, when she was working in India, in 1937. It seemed to stimulate the proliferation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells when administered to children with this cancer. In one of the first examples of rational drug design (rather than accidental discovery), Farber used folate analogues synthesized by Harriett Kilte and Yellapragada Subbarow of Lederle Laboratories. These analogues — first aminopterin and then amethopterin (now methotrexate) were antagonistic to folic acid, and blocked the function of folate-requiring enzymes. When administered to children with ALL in 1948, these agents became the first drugs to induce remission in children with ALL. Remissions were brief, but the principle was clear — antifolates could suppress proliferation of malignant cells, and could thereby re-establish normal bone-marrow function. Farber met resistance to conducting his studies {{at a time when the}} commonly held medical belief was that leukemia was incurable, and that the <b>children</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed to die in peace. Afterwards, Farber's 1948 report in the New England Journal of Medicine was met with incredulity and ridicule.|$|E
