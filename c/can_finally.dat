5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) {{all the way to}} the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile <b>can</b> <b>finally</b> begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex <b>can</b> <b>finally</b> be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E

25|$|Most {{commentators}} associate Jaspers {{with the}} philosophy of existentialism, {{in part because he}} draws largely upon the existentialist roots of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, and in part because the theme of individual freedom permeates his work. In Philosophy (3 vols, 1932), Jaspers gave his view of the history of philosophy and introduced his major themes. Beginning with modern science and empiricism, Jaspers points out that as we question reality, we confront borders that an empirical (or scientific) method simply cannot transcend. At this point, the individual faces a choice: sink into despair and resignation, or take a leap of faith toward what Jaspers calls Transcendence. In making this leap, individuals confront their own limitless freedom, which Jaspers calls Existenz, and <b>can</b> <b>finally</b> experience authentic existence.|$|E

Upset over what she did to him, Hook takes the dreamcatcher to erase Emma's memories of the events in Camelot, while Zelena places the anti-magic cuffs on her. Mary Margaret, David, Henry and Regina arrive to find Emma unconscious on a couch, and powerless. When she awakens, she tells them about Hook's becoming a Dark One.

25|$|Jean Grey {{appears in}} , voiced by Yurika Hino and voiced again by Jennifer Hale in the English distribution. At the {{beginning}} of the series, she is consumed by the Phoenix Force and nearly destroys the world with her tremendous strength and power. The X-Men engage in a brief battle with her, until she ultimately sacrifices herself to save the world. Although she apparently dies, she assists the X-Men with conflicts through a strong telepathic link in later episodes, such as saving Professor X from hallucinations, and appears as the White Phoenix of the Crown, encouraging the X-Men to keep on fighting to save the world. She was in a strong and close romantic relationship with Cyclops, and had a necklace with a ruby stone with gold {{in the shape of a}} phoenix, which was a gift from Cyclops. The necklace was then given to Hisako as a sign that Cyclops <b>can</b> <b>finally</b> let Jean go, as he recognizes her sacrifice as a symbol of love for her friends and the world.

25|$|Almost all of {{the organic}} {{hydrogen}} is exchangeable to some extent. Isotopic exchange of organic hydrogen will reorder the distribution of deuterium and often incorporate external hydrogen. Generally, more mature materials are more substantially exchanged. With effective exchange, aliphatic hydrogen <b>can</b> <b>finally</b> reach isotopic equilibrium at the final stage. Equilibrium fractionation factor varies among different hydrogen sites. For example, aliphatic hydrogen isotope fractionation depends on the carbon atom that the hydrogen atom bonds with. To the first order, alkyl hydrogen isotope composition follows this trend: δDPrimary carbon < δDSecondary carbon < δDTertiary carbon. The fractionation factors between carbon sites also decrease with increasing temperature. This can be potentially used as a thermo-history indicator. The fractionation between whole molecule and water can be estimated by averaging all hydrogen-positions, and {{this leads to a}} relatively small variation of equilibrium fractionation between different groups of hydrocarbons and water. A theoretical prediction estimated this to be -80‰ to -95‰ for steranes, -90‰ to -95‰ for hopanes, and -70‰ to -95‰ for typical cycloparaffins between 0°C to 100°C. At the temperature of the oil window and gas window, the equilibrium fractionation between different group of organic molecules is relatively small, as compared with large primary signals.|$|E
25|$|Silas sets Lynsey the {{challenge}} of guessing his next victim before Halloween although if she fails he will kill the intended victim. Lynsey attacks Silas following his taunts and is arrested for GBH and although she is issued a warning, she is released.

Lynsey is {{thrown out of the}} party after trying to convince the guests that a murder is going to take place. When Lynsey returns home, Silas confronts her, confessing that she is his intended victim and that if he were to kill Lynsey he would confess to the police.

Lynsey and Riley discover Silas' victim's rings and Mercedes' engagement ring, leading to Silas being arrested. Silas refuses to reveal Mercedes' location, saying that he wants Lynsey as she is an opponent he has a rapport. Silas and Lynsey exchange taunts which angers Silas in to revealing Mercedes location. Mercedes gives birth and Lynsey visits Silas for a final time, telling him that he is just a sad old man that no longer has any hold over her and that she <b>can</b> <b>finally</b> sleep soundly.

The others realize that Fiona has crafted the perfect trap: If Gideon kills Emma, Light will be destroyed. And if Emma kills Gideon, she will turn dark and Light will still be destroyed. Regina consoles Emma and encourages her to find another way like she always does. Emma attempts to hold off Gideon as Gold finds Gideon's heart. When Gold finds Gideon's heart he is tempted by {{a manifestation of the}} Darkness, which takes the form of his Enchanted Forest counterpart, Rumplestiltskin. The Dark One manifestation tells him to let Gideon kill Emma so he <b>can</b> <b>finally</b> have it all: power and love. The manifestation reminds Gold of what Fiona told him, that if Emma dies his Dark Magic will increase exponentially. After it's all over he can spend 100 years exploring the world with Belle, and spend the next 200 years destroying it. Gold resists and chooses {{to do the right thing}} and tries to use Gideon's heart to stop him from killing Emma. However Fiona's spell keeps him from being able to free Gideon and instead Gideon's heart stops beating and dims. The manifestation taunts Gold before disappearing and Gold heads out to Belle who consoles him for trying to do the right thing. Back at the intersection, Emma and Gideon fight with Emma acknowledging her role as the Savior to protect those she loves, protect the innocent and to spread light and hope no matter what the cost. Realizing what she must do, Emma throws down her sword and Gideon apologizes and kills her releasing an enormous blast of light magic, ending the Final Battle.|$|E
