50|$|Literature {{states that}} very few <b>crossbites</b> tend to self-correct which often justify the {{treatment}} approach of correcting these bites as early as possible. Only 0-9% of <b>crossbites</b> self-correct. Lindner et al. reported that in a 50% of <b>crossbites</b> were corrected in 76 four year old children.|$|R
50|$|Goal {{to treat}} {{unilateral}} <b>crossbites</b> should definitely include removal of occlusal interferences and {{elimination of the}} functional shift. Treating posterior <b>crossbites</b> early may help prevent the occurrence of Temporomandibular joint pathology.|$|R
5000|$|Single tooth <b>crossbites</b> {{can occur}} due to uneruption {{of a primary}} teeth {{in a timely manner}} which causes {{permanent}} tooth to erupt in a different eruption pattern which is lingual to the primary tooth. Single tooth <b>crossbites</b> are often fixed by using a finger-spring based appliances. This type of spring can be attached to a removable appliance which is used by patient every day to correct the tooth position.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. <b>Crossbite</b> {{smiles and}} bows; {{as a lawyer}} smiles on the {{solicitor}} who employs him, and I dare say, thrusts his tongue into his cheek, and whispers into the first great wig that passes him, 'What the d--l does old Fairford mean by letting loose his whelp on me?' ...|$|E

If I might advise, you will hasten to Court, and lay some foundation for the impression we wish to make. If your Grace can take the first word, and throw out a hint to <b>crossbite</b> Saville, it will be well. But above all, keep the King's ear employed, which no one can do so well as you. Leave Chiffinch to fill his heart with a proper object. Another thing is, there is a blockhead of an old Cavalier, who must needs be a bustler in the Countess of Derby's behalf--he is fast in hold, with the whole tribe of witnesses at his haunches." ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{father took}} a long pinch of snuff, and replied, 'Very well, Alan; very well indeed. I wish Mr. <b>Crossbite</b> or Counsellor Pest had heard you; they must have {{acknowledged}} {{that you have a}} talent for forensic elocution; and it may not be amiss to try a little declamation at home now and then, to gather audacity and keep yourself in breath. But touching the subject of this paraffle of words, it's not worth a pinch of tobacco. D'ye think that I care for Mr. Herries of Birrenswork more than any other gentleman who comes here about business, although I do not care to go tilting at his throat, because he speaks like a grey goose, as he is?

60|$|As I {{stood beside}} them, too much vexed at the childish part I {{was made to}} play to derive much {{information}} from the valuable arguments of Mr. <b>Crossbite,</b> I observed a rather elderly man, who stood with his eyes firmly bent on my father, as if he only waited an end of the business {{in which he was}} engaged, to address him. There was something, I thought, in the gentleman's appearance which commanded attention. Yet his dress was not in the present taste, and though it had once been magnificent, was now antiquated and unfashionable. His coat was of branched velvet, with a satin lining, a waistcoat of violet-coloured silk, much embroidered; his breeches the same stuff as the coat. He wore square-toed shoes, with foretops, as they are called; and his silk stockings were rolled up over his knee, as you may have seen in pictures, and here and there on some of those originals who seem to pique themselves on dressing after the mode of Methuselah. A CHAPEAU BRAS and sword necessarily completed his equipment, which, though out of date, showed that it belonged to a man of distinction.|$|E
5000|$|Bjork defined {{posterior}} <b>crossbite</b> as a malocclusion {{where the}} buccal cusps of canine, premolar and molar of upper teeth occlude lingually to the buccal cusps of canine, premolar and molar of lower teeth. Posterior <b>crossbite</b> is often correlated {{to a narrow}} maxilla and upper dental arch. A posterior <b>crossbite</b> can be unilateral, bilateral, single-tooth or entire segment <b>crossbite.</b> Posterior <b>crossbite</b> {{has been reported to}} occur between 7-23% of the population. The most common type of posterior <b>crossbite</b> to occur is the unilateral <b>crossbite</b> which occurs in 80% to 97% of the posterior <b>crossbite</b> cases. Posterior crossbites also occur most commonly in primary and mixed dentition. This type of <b>crossbite</b> usually presents with a functional shift of the mandible towards the side of the <b>crossbite.</b> Posterior <b>crossbite</b> can occur due to either skeletal, dental or functional abnormalities. One of the common reasons for development of posterior <b>crossbite</b> is the size difference between maxilla and mandible, where maxilla is smaller than mandible. Posterior <b>crossbite</b> can result due to ...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the keys}} in {{diagnosing}} the anterior <b>crossbite</b> due to skeletal vs dental causes is diagnosing a CR-CO shift in a patient. An adolescent presenting with anterior <b>crossbite</b> may be positioning their mandible forward into centric occlusion (CO) due to the dental interferences. Thus finding their occlusion in centric relation (CR) is key in diagnosis. For anterior <b>crossbite,</b> if their CO matches their CR then the patient truly has a skeletal component to their <b>crossbite.</b> If the CR shows a less severe class 3 malocclusion or teeth not in anterior <b>crossbite,</b> this may mean that their anterior <b>crossbite</b> results due to dental interferences.|$|E
30|$|The {{deciduous}} dental arches lay {{the foundation}} on which proper development of the permanent dental arches takes place. The inter-canine and inter-molar widths are largely established during the deciduous dentition and do not increase drastically during growth and development. Various authors have analysed the association of inter-canine and inter-molar width {{with the presence of}} various deleterious oral habits in children [6]. Non-nutritive sucking like pacifier, digit or dummy sucking has often been implicated as an important etiologic factor in the development of posterior <b>crossbites</b> [7]. Heredity, nasal obstruction (caused by enlarged tonsils and adenoids) and oral breathing have also been associated with the increased prevalence of posterior <b>crossbites</b> [8].|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{quantify}} {{the severity of}} malocclusion and dental esthetic problems in untreated Down syndrome (DS) and untreated non-Down syndrome children age 8 – 14 years old using the PAR and ICON Indices. Materials and Methods. This retrospective study evaluated pretreatment study models, intraoral photographs, and panoramic radiographs of 30 Down syndrome and two groups of 30 non-Down syndrome patients (private practice and university clinic) age 8 – 14 years. The models were scored via PAR and ICON Indices, and descriptive characteristics such as Angle classification, missing or impacted teeth, <b>crossbites,</b> open bites, and other dental anomalies were recorded. Results. The DS group had significantly greater PAR and ICON scores, as well as 10 times more missing teeth than the non-DS group. The DS group possessed predominantly Class III malocclusions, {{with the presence of}} both anterior and posterior <b>crossbites</b> in a majority of the patients. The non-DS group had mostly Class I or II malocclusion with markedly fewer missing teeth and <b>crossbites.</b> The DS group also had more severe malocclusions based upon occlusal traits such as open bite and type of malocclusion. Conclusion. The DS group had very severe malocclusions, while the control group from the university clinic had more severe malocclusions than a control group from a private practice...|$|R
50|$|Unilateral <b>crossbites</b> {{can also}} be {{diagnosed}} and treated properly by using a Deprogramming splint. This splint has flat occlusal surface which causes the muscles to deprogram themselves and establish new sensory engrams. When the splint is removed, a proper centric relation bite can be diagnosed from the bite.|$|R
5000|$|An {{anterior}} <b>crossbite</b> due to dental component involves {{displacement of}} either maxillary central or lateral incisors lingual {{to their original}} erupting positions. This may happen due to delayed eruption of the primary teeth leading to permanent teeth moving lingual to their primary predecessors. This will lead to anterior <b>crossbite</b> where upon biting, upper teeth are behind the lower front teeth and may involve few or all frontal incisors. In this type of <b>crossbite,</b> the maxillary and mandibular proportions are normal {{to each other and}} to the cranial base. Another reason that may lead to a dental <b>crossbite</b> is crowding in the maxillary arch. Permanent teeth will tend to erupt lingual to the primary teeth in presence of crowding. Side-effects caused by dental <b>crossbite</b> can be increased recession on the buccal of lower incisors and higher chance of inflammation in the same area. Another term for an anterior <b>crossbite</b> due to dental interferences is Pseudo Class III <b>Crossbite</b> or Malocclusion.|$|E
50|$|A {{child with}} {{posterior}} <b>crossbite</b> {{should be treated}} immediately if the child shifts his mandible on closing which is often seen in a unilateral <b>crossbite</b> as mentioned above. The best age to treat a child with <b>crossbite</b> is in their mixed dentition when their palatal sutures have not fused to each other. Palatal expansion allows more space in an arch to relieve crowding and correct posterior <b>crossbite.</b> The correction can include any type of palatal expanders that will expand the palate which resolves the narrow constriction of the maxilla. There are several therapies {{that can be used}} to correct a posterior crossbite: braces, 'Z' spring or cantilever spring, quad helix, removable plates, clear aligner therapy, or a Delaire mask. The correct therapy should be decided by the orthodontist depending on the type and severity of the <b>crossbite.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Unilateral <b>crossbite</b> {{involves}} {{one side}} of the arch. The most common cause of unilateral <b>crossbite</b> is a narrow maxillary dental arch. This can happen due to habits such as digit sucking, prolonged use of pacifier or upper airway obstruction. Due to the discrepancy between the maxillary and mandibular arch, neuromuscular guidance of the mandible causes mandible to close forcibly towards the side of the <b>crossbite.</b> Thus a lateral shift of the mandibular position occurs, which can become structural if left untreated for a long time during growth, leading to skeletal asymmetries. Unilateral crossbites can present with following features in a child ...|$|E
30|$|No {{statistically}} significant association was observed between NNS habits and {{the prevalence of}} posterior <b>crossbites</b> (P = 0.108) and anterior open bites (P = 0.379). The OR revealed that children breastfed for < 6 months had almost twofold prevalence of NNS habits than children who were breastfed ≥ 6 months (Tables 1 and 2).|$|R
30|$|An {{increased}} {{prevalence of}} NNS {{in the first}} group suggests that NNS is a dominant variable in the association between breastfeeding duration and reduced intra-arch transverse diameters which leads to increased prevalence of posterior <b>crossbites</b> as seen in our study. Mandibular inter-canine width is however unaffected due to a lowered tongue posture seen in these children.|$|R
40|$|Anterior <b>crossbites</b> are {{difficult}} to correct in adults. A case where microimplants {{were placed in the}} lingual tori of an adult patient along with a lingual appliance is reported. The use of the esthetic lingual appliance along with the stable anchorage provided by the microimplants, aids in decreasing the duration of treatment as well as making the same more acceptable to the patient...|$|R
50|$|<b>Crossbite</b> {{is a form}} of {{malocclusion}} where a tooth (or teeth) has a more buccal or lingual position (that is, {{the tooth}} is either closer to the cheek or to the tongue) than its corresponding antagonist tooth in the upper or lower dental arch. In other words, <b>crossbite</b> is a lateral misalignment of the dental arches.|$|E
5000|$|An {{anterior}} <b>crossbite</b> can {{be referred}} as negative overjet, and {{is typical of}} class III skeletal relations (prognathism).|$|E
5000|$|An {{anterior}} <b>crossbite</b> due to skeletal reasons {{will involve}} a deficient maxilla {{and a more}} hyperplastic or overgrown mandible. People {{with this type of}} <b>crossbite</b> will have dental compensation which involves proclined maxillary incisors and retroclined mandibular incisors. A proper diagnosis can be made by having a person bite into their centric relation will show mandibular incisors ahead of the maxillary incisors, which will show the skeletal discrepancy between the two jaws.|$|E
30|$|Some {{benefits}} of the RPE in conjunction with maxillary protraction therapy in treating skeletal class III patients are correction of <b>crossbites</b> often associated with class III malocclusions, anchoring the maxillary dentition against forward movement and anterior constriction, and backward and downward rotation of the mandible [6, 24 – 27]. Turley [5] stated that palatal expansion “disarticulates” the maxilla and initiates cellular responses in these circummaxillary sutures, allowing for a more positive reaction to protraction forces potentiating orthopedic effects. Melsen [24] confirmed these increased cellular responses to RPE.|$|R

40|$|Occlusal {{traits and}} craniofacial {{morphology}} were studied in growing patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Sixteen patients from 6 to 20 {{years of age}} were examined and compared with 16 healthy male individuals matched according to age. The dental arches and occlusal traits of both groups were analysed on dental casts and compared with the norms of healthy individuals from the literature. Lateral cephalograms of the patients were compared with normal individuals by using scored values based on standard deviations in order to compensate for heterogeneity {{in the age of}} the subjects. Statistical analysis was undertaken for continuous variables with a paired Student's t-test and non-continuous variables with a chi-square test. Linear regressions were used to evaluate the influence of age. A high prevalence of malocclusions was found, including posterior <b>crossbites,</b> anterior and lateral open bites, a tendency towards mesio-occlusion due to a skeletal Class III malocclusion, and dental compensations of the Class III relationship by retrusion of the lower incisors. Both upper and lower arches were widened posteriorly. The lower arches were even wider than the upper arches, resulting in frequent posterior <b>crossbites.</b> No significant skeletal vertical deviations were observed in this group of DMD patients, except for the maxillary plane angle (NL/NSL) that was larger than normal, while the anterior upper face height (NSp) was smaller. However, no difference was found in lower face height. The posterior enlargement of the dental arches and the dentoalveolar development towards an Angle Class III relationship were significantly related to age and found more frequently among the older subject...|$|R
