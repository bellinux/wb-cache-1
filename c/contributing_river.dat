The coastal state of Bahia hosts the most extensive and richest area of coral reefs in the South Atlantic Ocean. Assessment, planning and management of coral reef ecosystems are particularly challenging tasks. This work shows how the creation of a GIS improves the process of management, monitoring and conservation of the Bahian reef environments The initial data input started by the vectorization of 1) bathymetric data from the Bureau of Hydrography and Navigation (DHN), 2) shoreline and mangrove areas from Landsat 7 ETM + images, 3) near surface reefs from Quickbird images, and 4) coastal and marine protected areas of federal, state and local administrations. Geological, physical, biological and social information was then included {{in order to create a}} suitable marine GIS for conservation aims. The data includes information on sediment granulometry and transport patterns, rocky substrate outcrops, sea surface temperature, wave direction, rain precipitation, major <b>contributing</b> <b>river</b> discharge, artisanal fishery, benthic cover and bleaching data. ReefBahia GIS has provided essential information for a better understanding of coral reefs of the state of Bahia geological and ecological characteristics such as mapping, representation, connectivity and biodiversity of coral reefs, geological facies, Quaternary sedimentation, numeric modeling of wave refraction and monitoring of bleaching events...|$|E
30|$|Estimating {{recharge}} {{with the}} use of traditional hydrogeological methods (e.g. water balance methods, lysimeters, and Darcy’s method) is influenced by methodological difficulties (Grindley 1969; Hough and Jones 1998; Chapman and Malone 2002; Yeh et al. 2004). On the other hand, a better understanding of aquifer recharge can be gained by monitoring isotope changes. Isotope methods are often considered as unique tools that offer insights into processes of groundwater recharge and the systems of groundwater flow. Furthermore, they have been in extensive use in various regions (Bhattacharya et al. 1985; Krishnamurthy and Bhattacharya 1991; Zhang et al. 2005; Blasch and Bryson 2007; Li et al. 2008; Yuan et al. 2011), especially when conditions are arid and semi-arid for several years (IAEA 2011). Specifically, δ 2 H and δ 18 O are considered ideal conservative tracers that offer insights into the groundwater system’s recharge and flow since they make up the actual water molecule and their compositions remain the same unless the flow path has phase changes or fractionation (Clark and Fritz 1997). Therefore, groundwater would retain its isotopic fingerprint, which a reflection of its origin and history prior to infiltration. The groundwater isotopic content is dependent on the recharge isotopic content. Groundwater that goes through direct infiltration from precipitation possesses precipitation’s isotopic signature. On the other hand, the groundwater that is recharged using other sources like rivers and lakes will reveal the <b>contributing</b> <b>river</b> or lake mean isotopic content. Furthermore, their signature is expected to vary from that of local precipitation (IAEA 2011). That makes it possible to trace the recharge water source and flow path by examining the differences in the isotopic signature of various different waters (Craig 1961; Onodera et al. 1995; Lee and Lee 1999; Coplen et al. 2000; Vandenschrick et al. 2002; Ma et al. 2007; Mukherjee et al. 2007; Kyle and Jeannie 2007; Palmer et al. 2007; Yeh et al. 2009, 2011; Mandal et al. 2011).|$|E

The sediments, <b>contributing</b> <b>rivers,</b> and water body of the lake are taken to represent the whole lake's aquatic environment. They are analyzed and ranked through PCA and relative principal component. The result showed that the worst and best sediment sampling points are Yunlianghe River and Guanyinshan West.

5000|$|Hapua {{have been}} {{identified}} as establishing in the Canterbury Bight coastal region on the east coast of the South Island. They are often found in areas of coarse-grained sediment where <b>contributing</b> <b>rivers</b> have moderately steep bed gradients. [...] MSG beaches in the Canterbury Bight region contain a wide range of sediment sizes from sand to boulders and are exposed to the high energy waves that make up an east coast swell environment. [...] MSG beaches are reflective rather than dissipative energy zones due to their morphological characteristics. They have a steep foreshore which is known as the ‘engine room’ of the beach profile. In this zone, swash and backwash are dominating processes alongside longshore transport. [...] MSG beaches do not have a surf zone; instead a single line of breakers is visible in all sea conditions. [...] Hapua are associated with MSG beaches as the variation in sediment size allows for the barrier to be permeable.|$|R

40|$|M. Sc. Sediment analysis, {{especially}} for trace metals, is important since aquatic sediments act as sinks for metals in the environment. Total element analysis yields insufficient {{information on the}} bioavailability and the geochemical fate of these metals. Sequential extraction procedures were developed to determine the partitioning of metals in sediment phases. The need for comparability of data produced world-wide {{led to the development}} of a sequential extraction procedure, which was proposed by the Community Bureau of Reference as a standard procedure (refered to as the BCR protocol). We contributed to the validation of the BCR procedure by using well-defined in-house model sediments. The results obtained for the model sediments showed that the BCR procedure could distinguish effectively between anthropogenically introduced metals and metals that form part of the mineral structure of the sediment components. The BCR procedure was applied to the sediments of the Vaal Dam and its <b>contributing</b> <b>rivers.</b> The amount of metals extracted in the first three steps of the sequential extraction procedure were low, indicating a very small contribution of anthropogenically introduced metals. It was therefore concluded that these sediments were relatively unpolluted compared to water systems in, for example, Europe...|$|R
40|$|During recent decades, {{coastal waters}} of North American have been {{polluted}} by river-borne nutrients. Coastal eutrophication is often caused by this pollution {{and results in}} increases in occurrence of harmful algal bloom, fish kills, and hypoxic zones. Due to the anthropogenic activities associated with the Mississippi River/Atchafalaya River basin region, {{it is necessary to}} better understand and implement proper management practices to reduce environmental impacts. The high level of nutrient influx into watersheds is increasing with expansion in population size and activities. Nutrient enrichment, or eutrophication, is an environmental consequence of both natural and anthropogenic activities. Human-induced hypoxia is often correlated with eutrophication occurring alongside watersheds with agricultural activities or large populations. Eutrophication, primarily from nitrogen and phosphorus, is greatly increased in areas of heavy agribusiness, such as the Mississippi River basin and Atchafalaya River basin. The Mississippi River physically and biologically dominates the continental shelf of the northern Gulf. The annual hypoxic zone in the northern Gulf of Mexico is a well-documented recurring economic and ecological threat. Significant research has connected nutrient loading in the <b>contributing</b> <b>rivers</b> to the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico...|$|R
