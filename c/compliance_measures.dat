40|$|Summary <b>measures</b> of VAT <b>compliance</b> {{rates are}} {{valuable}} for identifying problem areas in VAT implementation. They are also essential for meaningful cross-country and cross-time comparisons of VAT compliance. We present a comprehensive and general framework for calculating VAT compliance rates {{at both the}} economy-wide and detailed sectoral levels. Unlike existing <b>measures</b> of VAT <b>compliance,</b> our framework isolates a <b>compliance</b> <b>measure</b> from the effects on VAT receipts of detailed features of VAT systems as actually implemented by tax authorities. These features include multiple VAT rates, exemptions, registration rates, refund limitations, informal activity, taxation of domestic non-residents, and undeclared imports. We implement our comprehensive VAT <b>compliance</b> <b>measure</b> for Vietnam, {{a country with a}} complex VAT system. Our estimate of Vietnam's VAT compliance rate is about eleven percentage points higher than that calculated by the most popular <b>measure</b> of <b>compliance,</b> collection efficiency (CE). Our method facilitates decomposition of the difference between CE and our VAT <b>compliance</b> <b>measure</b> into the individual contributions of statutory and structural features of Vietnam's VAT regime.

40|$|Determining {{the melt}} {{distribution}} in oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges {{is critical to}} understanding how magma is transported and emplaced in the crust. Seafloor compliance—deformation under ocean wave forcing—is primarily sensitive to regions of low shear velocity in the crust, making it a useful tool to probe melt distribution. Analysis of compliance data collected at East Pacific Rise between 9 ° and 10 °N through 3 -D numerical modeling reveals strong along-axis variations in the lower crustal shear velocities, as well as temporal variation of crustal shear velocity near 9 ° 48 ′N between measurements spanning 8 years. <b>Compliance</b> <b>measured</b> across the rise axis at 9 ° 48 ′N and 9 ° 33 ′N suggest a deep crustal low-velocity zone beneath the ridge axis, with a low Vs/Vp ratio consistent with melt in low aspect ratio cracks or sills. Changes in <b>compliance</b> <b>measured</b> at 9 ° 48 ′N between years 1999 and 2007 suggest that the melt fraction in the axial crust decreased during this interval, perhaps following the 2005 – 2006 seafloor eruption.

40|$|Background: Previous {{reviews of}} the {{literature}} on medication compliance have con-firmed the inverse relationship between umber of daily doses and rate of compliance. However, compliance in most of these studies was based on patient self-report, blood-level monitoring, prescription refills, or pill count data, none of which are as accurate as electronic monitoring (EM). Objective: In this paper, we review studies in which <b>compliance</b> was <b>measured</b> with an EM device to determine the associations between dose frequency and medication compliance. Methods: Articles included in this review were identified through literature searches of MEDLINE ®, Psychlnfo ®, HealthStar, Health & Psychosocial Instruments, and the Cochrane Library using the search terms patient compliance, patient adherence, lec-tronic monitoring, and MEMS (medication event monitoring systems). The review was limited to studies reporting <b>compliance</b> <b>measured</b> by EM devices, the most accurate com-pliance assessment method to date. Because EM was introduced only in 1986, the litera-ture search was restricted to the years 1986 to 2000. In the identified studies, data wer...|$|R

40|$|Audit {{objective}} and criteria The {{objective of the}} audit {{was to assess the}} Department of Human Services’ and the Department of Social Services’ management of selected fraud prevention and compliance Budget measures. To form a conclusion against the audit objective, the ANAO adopted the following high level audit criteria: 	Have sound processes and practices been established to support the design and implementation of specific Budget-funded <b>compliance</b> <b>measures?</b> 	Is there effective monitoring of the implementation and achievement of the measures? 	Have expected savings and other benefits from the measures been achieved? The audit focussed on seven Centrelink-related <b>compliance</b> <b>measures</b> announced in the relevant Budgets and implemented from 2012 – 13 to 2015 – 16 (see Appendix 2). In examining the Strengthening the Integrity of Welfare Payments measure, the audit focussed on two specific initiatives that had identified savings for 2015 – 16 —that is, the Employment Income Matching initiative and the AUSTRAC initiative. The audit’s scope did not consider any <b>compliance</b> <b>measures</b> announced following the 2015 – 16 Budget. Further, the audit scope did not examine the Department of Human Services’ management of its broader Centrelink compliance program. Conclusion The Department of Human Services’ management of the seven selected <b>compliance</b> <b>measures</b> resulted in: 	three measures not being effectively implemented; 	two measures’ implementation being partially effective—with one measure achieving the expected savings but not the expected level of compliance activity and the other measure achieving the expected level of compliance activity but not the expected savings; and 	two measures being effectively implemented. As a consequence, most of the <b>compliance</b> <b>measures</b> examined did not fully achieve their expected outcomes, including savings and addressing the risks to payment integrity, as agreed. Shortcomings were also identified in the Department of Human Services’ approach to monitoring and reporting for all measures examined. As the entity responsible for the Administered appropriations against which savings were to be delivered, the Department of Social Services’ oversight of the achievements of the measures was not effective. Improvements are warranted to both the bilateral and the internal monitoring arrangements presently in place, to support both entities’ capacity to track progress against the Government’s expected outcomes, including savings targets. The Department of Social Services used an agreed methodology to calculate the savings expected from the <b>compliance</b> <b>measures</b> and the Department of Human Services developed useful implementation plans to support the delivery of the measures. There are opportunities to improve both the methodology and plans. The monitoring and oversight arrangements for the <b>compliance</b> <b>measures,</b> set out under the Bilateral Management Arrangement between the Department of Social Services and the Department of Human Services, have not been effective as they were not followed. The Department of Social Services as the relevant policy entity did not take responsibility for monitoring outcomes, including impacts and actual savings, achieved from the measures. The Department of Human Services’ internal and external monitoring and reporting for <b>compliance</b> <b>measures</b> could be improved. While the Department of Human Services has well established monitoring and reporting arrangements, these mechanisms did not consistently provide clear and accurate advice on whether the <b>compliance</b> <b>measures</b> were achieving the desired outcomes, including savings and planned levels of activity...|$|E
