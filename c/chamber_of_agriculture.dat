5|$|In 1925, Strachwitz and {{his family}} moved from their palace in Groß Stein to their manor in Alt Siedel, because of {{personal}} differences with his father, who remained in Groß Stein. Between 1924 and 1933 Strachwitz founded two dairy cooperatives which many local farmers joined. In parallel he studied a few semesters of forestry. He used his knowledge to influence the Silesian forest owners to sell their wood to the paper mills. He continued to use his influence in Upper Silesia to modernize forestry and farming. His ambitions were aided by his presidency of the Forstausschuss (Forestry Committee) of Upper Silesia and his membership in the Landwirtschaftskammer (<b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture).</b> Strachwitz completely took over his father's estate in 1929, first as the General Manager and then as owner, with full responsibility. This made Strachwitz {{one of the most}} wealthy land and forest owners in Silesia. Along with the palace in Groß Stein he owned a lime kiln and quarry in Klein Stein—present-day Kamionek—and Groß Stein, a distillery in Groß Stein and Alt Siedel.|$|E

25|$|Up {{until the}} 1960s, the {{economic}} activities of Villa Regina were {{regulated by the}} <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture,</b> Industry, and Commerce of the Upper Valley (Spanish: Cámara de Agricultura, Industria y Comercio del Alto Valle), or the CAIC, the organization that had also focused {{on the rest of}} the cities of the Upper Valley of Río Negro since 1931. On February 20, 1962, the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Production of Villa Regina was created, replacing the role of the CAIC. The chamber was created to mediate between the different trade unions of the city and to unite their representatives on a board. In 1964, the First National Comahue Fair was held. The 45-day event, organized by the Chamber, was intended to showcase the economical potential of the Comahue Region, as well as to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of Villa Regina. The fair was organized by Bartolo Pasin and Rogelio Chimenti, two local businessmen.|$|E
25|$|The {{declaration}} of the protectorate left Sharrer in possession of three large and two smaller estates, all largely undeveloped. Unlike other large landowners, whose holdings were concentrated in the Shire Highlands, about half of Sharrer's land was in the Shire valley. Sharrer sold off some land near the main settlement of Blantyre and also experimented {{with a variety of}} crops. He first tried coffee, and by 1891 he had the greatest area of coffee planted in the protectorate. He soon followed this up with tobacco, and was the first settler to grow cotton in the Middle Shire valley from 1901. However, by 1902 when Sharrer's landholdings were transferred to the British Central Africa Company Ltd, only a few thousand acres were being cultivated. Sharrer was one of the leading estate owners and formed the Shire Highland Planters Association in November 1891, becoming its Chairman. In 1895, it joined with its rival, the Nyasaland Planters Association, to form the British Central Africa <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> and Commerce, a powerful pressure group for European planters and their businesses.|$|E
25|$|John Buchanan (1855–96) {{was first}} apprenticed to a {{gardener}} at Drummond Castle. He {{was one of}} the original employees of the Blantyre Church of Scotland Mission when it was founded in 1876, working as a gardener, and in 1878 moved to open an outstation of the mission on the Mulunguzi River, which became the site of Zomba, the capital of Nyasaland. He was dismissed by the mission in 1881 for brutality, but by this time he had exchanged low-value trade goods for around 170,000 acres of land. This land was acquired in the name of Buchanan Brothers, a partnership of him and his two younger brothers David and Robert, who joined him in Central Africa in 1881. These land deals were probably made in the expectation that, with more settlers, land prices would rise. Buchanan also acted as broker for non-residents wishing to buy land, including Alexander Low Bruce, whose land formed the A L Bruce Estates. Buchanan Brothers experimented with a number of crops starting with coffee, which was being exported by 1891. In early 1890s, they had introduced Virginia-type tobacco, planted an experimental tea garden and built a sugar mill to produce sugar for the local market. From being a disgraced missionary, John Buchanan became Acting British Consul to Central Africa from 1887 to 1891, and in that capacity declared a protectorate over the Shire Highlands in 1889 to pre-empt a Portuguese expedition that intended to claim sovereignty in that region. In 1891, this became part of the British Central Africa Protectorate. In 1892, he helped to form the Nyasaland Planters Association, which mainly represented the interests of Buchanan Brothers and the African Lakes Company. In 1895, this fused with a rival association to form the British Central Africa <b>Chamber</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> and Commerce, a powerful lobby group for settler interests. John Buchanan was the first Chairman, but he died suddenly early in 1896 and was succeeded by his brother Robert, who died a few months later. David Buchanan had already died in 1892. There were other family members, but none were resident in British Central Africa or involved in the business. After the deaths of the three Buchanan brothers, the Buchanan Brothers Company was formed to take over the partnership assets, and it was run by a local manager until 1901.|$|E
40|$|DOI: 10. 1684 /agr. 2011. 0516 International audienceThe French <b>Chambers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> {{facing the}} {{commercialisation}} {{of services to}} farmers Advisors <b>of</b> the <b>Chambers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> increasingly provide advice as invoiced services. These provisions of services can take place {{within the framework of}} a public service or be invoiced to farmers to obtain benefits. Our hypothesis is that the invoicing of services, in any case, changes the job of advisor both in its practice and in its orientation. We explore this hypothesis {{on the basis of a}} survey carried out in 2008 with 300 advisors of the French "departmental" <b>Chambers</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> <b>of</b> 3 "Regions," Bourgogne, Franche-Comté, and Rhone-Alpes through interviews conducted with advisors. The survey results show that there is a split between two positions amongst the agents <b>of</b> the <b>Chambers</b> <b>of</b> Agriculture: 56 % of the agents surveyed thought the public service dimension should be reinforced whereas 44 %thought that the commercialisation dimension should be increased. The split between these two options cannot be explained by age, gender or social background. Rather, it seems to be related more directly to the positions and organisational schemes <b>of</b> the <b>Chambers.</b> Whatever the advisor's opinion, invoicing the services transforms their advising practices...|$|R

According to another source the delegation saw the prime minister again on 6 May 1912 and, while agreeing there was no groundswell of opinion in Scotland for home rule, there was ‘concern and disgruntlement at the general neglect of Scottish affairs’ and they told Asquith they were worried this might escalate if not dealt with through an element of devolution.|$|E
