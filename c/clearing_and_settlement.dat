25|$|A {{victim of}} {{large-scale}} <b>clearing</b> <b>and</b> <b>settlement</b> to support {{one of the}} densest human populations in Asia, this ecoregion is under a great threat of extinction. Hundreds of years of habitation and exploitation have exacted a heavy toll on this ecoregion's habitat and biodiversity. There are two protected areas – Narendrapur (110km2) and Ata Danga Baor (20km2) that cover a mere 130km2 of the ecoregion. Habitat loss in this ecoregion is so extensive, and the remaining habitat is so fragmented, {{that it is difficult}} to ascertain the composition of the original vegetation of this ecoregion. According to Champion and Seth (1968), the freshwater swamp forests are characterised by Heritiera minor, Xylocarpus molluccensis, Bruguiera conjugata, Sonneratia apetala, Avicennia officinalis, and Sonneratia caseolaris, with Pandanus tectorius, Hibiscus tiliaceus, and Nipa fruticans along the fringing banks.|$|E
25|$|Most large {{derivatives}} exchanges operate their own clearing houses, {{allowing them to}} take revenues from post-trade processing as well as trading itself. By netting off the different positions traded, a smaller amount of capital is required as security to cover the trades. Of the big derivatives venues Chicago Mercantile Exchange, ICE and Eurex all clear trades themselves. There is sometimes a division of responsibility between provision of trading facility, and that of <b>clearing</b> <b>and</b> <b>settlement</b> of those trades. Derivative exchanges like the CBOE and LIFFE take responsibility for providing the trading environments, settlement of the resulting trades are usually handled by clearing houses that serve as central counterparties to trades done in the respective exchanges.

40|$|One {{advantage}} of a LANDSAT 3 return beam vidicon (RBV) scene is the synoptic view it provides. A 1 : 500, 000 paper print of the size 19. 4 cm x 19. 4 cm encompasses an area of about 3, 721 square miles (9, 637 sq. km.) and this compares very favorably in coverage to small scale aerial photography. A second important advantage is that the ground resolution is 38 by 38 meters. Compared to {{the resolution of the}} MSS which is 79 by 79 meters the RBV provides a wealth of detail useful for many purposes. A great variety of man made structures are visible including bridges, roads, docks, and small airfields. Agricultural field patterns are <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>settlements</b> of various sizes can be identified and delineated. A third advantage is related to the approximate panchromatic spectral response displayed in RBV images. Since many aerial photographic interpreters are accustomed to working with panchromatic photographs, they should have no difficulty understanding and putting RBV images immediately into use...|$|R
