5|$|The poem was {{revised and}} {{included}} in Keats's 1820 collection of poetry titled Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems. Although the publishers Taylor and Hessey feared {{the kind of}} bad reviews that had plagued Keats's 1818 edition of Endymion, {{they were willing to}} publish the collection after the removal of any potentially controversial poems to ensure {{that there would be no}} politically motivated reviews that <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> volume a bad reputation.|$|E
5|$|Laying pipe {{took several}} stages. First, {{the right of}} way had to be cleared with chainsaws, bulldozers, and {{scrapers}} who followed the rough route laid out by the initial surveyors. These crews were followed by another group of surveyors and engineers who determined whether the pipeline could be laid in the planned spot, or if it had to be moved because of permafrost, soft ground, or other considerations. State and federal surveillance officers, working with the engineers, <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> OK to move the path of the pipeline as much as 200 feet to the right or left in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E

Priestess chose for an earlier release in Canada {{so that they could}} begin touring in support of the record at last. All CD pressings of the album contain 11 tracks, but with the deluxe edition from Tee Pee Records comes a code to obtain a 13-track edition from the Internet. It contains the original 11 tracks, plus two bonus tracks. (As the band are signed only to Indica Records in Canada, all deluxe editions from Tee Pee Records are only released outside of Canada.) Two deluxe editions were released by Tee Pee Records: both came with the code for the Internet download, and one came with an exclusive T-shirt as well.|$|E
5|$|The Congo serpent eagle is superficially {{similar in}} plumage and size to Cassin's hawk-eagle, {{which has an}} {{overlapping}} range with the serpent eagle. It {{has been suggested that}} the Congo serpent eagle evolved to mimic the Cassin's hawk-eagle, which <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> serpent eagle several advantages, possibly including the ability to trick its reptilian prey into not fleeing, lowering its own predation, and/or minimizing mobbing by birds through its resemblance to a predator of birds. D. s. spectabilis more closely resembles the immature Cassin's hawk-eagle, while D. s. batesi resembles the adult. This is one of very few suspected examples of avian mimicry.|$|E

Gu offered to provide the KMT with details of CCP activities in Shanghai, but only if he <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> information directly to Chiang Kai-shek.|$|E

25|$|In {{representations}} of the Solar System, {{it is common to}} draw the trajectory of Earth {{from the point of view}} of the Sun, and the trajectory of the Moon from the point of view of Earth. This <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> impression that the Moon orbits Earth in such a way that sometimes it goes backwards when viewed from the Sun's perspective. Because the orbital velocity of the Moon around Earth (1km/s) is small compared to the orbital velocity of Earth about the Sun (30km/s), this never happens. There are no rearward loops in the Moon's solar orbit.|$|E
25|$|Political {{controls}} were instituted slowly under Carías. The Communist Party of Honduras (Partido Comunista de Honduras, PCH) was outlawed, but the PLH continued to function, {{and even the}} leaders of a small uprising in 1935 were later offered free air transportation should they wish to return to Honduras from their exile abroad. At the end of 1935, however, stressing the need for peace and internal order, Carías began {{to crack down on}} the opposition press and political activities. Meanwhile, the PNH, at the president's direction, began a propaganda campaign stressing that only the continuance of Carías in office <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> nation continued peace and order. The constitution, however, prohibited immediate reelection of presidents.|$|E
25|$|Once {{they have}} {{exhausted}} their supply of hydrogen through nuclear fusion, medium- to low-mass stars shed their outer layers {{to form a}} planetary nebula and evolve into white dwarfs. While most clusters become dispersed before {{a large proportion of}} their members have reached the white dwarf stage, the number of white dwarfs in open clusters is still generally much lower than would be expected, given the age of the cluster and the expected initial mass distribution of the stars. One possible explanation for the lack of white dwarfs is that when a red giant expels its outer layers to become a planetary nebula, a slight asymmetry in the loss of material <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> star a 'kick' of a few kilometres per second, enough to eject it from the cluster.|$|E

25|$|In a {{surprise}} move, the lame duck zoning commission reversed course in late November 1974 and approved the proposed revised zoning {{rules for the}} Georgetown waterfront. The Washington Post reported that the rezoning process would have to begin again under the home-rule zoning commission, and there was little chance that the new commission {{would be able to}} approve anything like the proposed regulations. The existing zoning commission acted, the newspaper suggested, because it would suffer no political retaliation (having gone out of business), its actions <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> home-rule zoning commission political cover to retain the rules, and because its members believed there had been enough delay and consideration of the rules. Development, the old commission felt, had to proceed now or it never would. The GCA immediately sued to have the new zoning regulations overturned, and the D.C. Superior Court blocked all development in the area while the suit was pending.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{variation}} in the pronunciation of the first consonant of certain clusters, most commonly C or P in cç, ct, pç and pt. These consonants may be variably elided or conserved. For some words, this variation may exist inside a country, sometimes in all of them; for others, the variation is dialectal, with the consonant being always pronounced in one country and always elided in the other. This variation affects 0.5% of the language's vocabulary, or 575 words out of 110,000. In most cases, Brazilians variably conserve the consonant while speakers elsewhere have invariably ceased to pronounce it (for example, detector in Brazil versus detetor in Portugal). The inverse situation is rarer, occurring in words such as fa(c)to and conta(c)to (consonants never pronounced in Brazil, pronounced elsewhere). Until 2009, this reality could not be apprehended from the spelling: while Brazilians did not write consonants that were no longer pronounced, the spelling of the other countries retained them in many words as silent letters, usually when there was still a vestige of their presence in the pronunciation of the preceding vowel. This <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> false impression that European Portuguese was phonologically more conservative in this aspect, when in fact it was Brazilian Portuguese that retained more consonants in pronunciation.|$|E
25|$|In early 2007, the Portuguese conglomerate, Sonae's {{takeover}} offer for Portugal Telecom failed. PT's board rejected an initial bid, worth EUR 11.1 bn, in February 2006. Sonae.com's takeover bid opposed Belmiro de Azevedo (founder and historical chairman of Sonae holding company) {{and his son}} Paulo Azevedo (then the head officer of Sonae.com telecommunications operator) to the investor José Berardo and PT's administrators Zeinal Bava and Henrique Granadeiro. In April 2007 the European Commission gave an ultimatum to the Portuguese government ordering it {{to give up on}} the 500 golden shares pack that it owned on the company and that enable special veto powers to the government on vital issues. This <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> government a decisive role in the bid by any company to buy Portugal Telecom. In November 2007, Portugal Telecom spun off its media assets (PT Multimédia), that included TV Cabo and Lusomundo Cinemas. In January 2008, the European Commission began legal proceedings against the Portuguese government over its 'golden share' in incumbent telecoms operator Portugal Telecom. The 500 golden shares with extended voting rights, allowing it to block potential takeover bids, were the reason for the Commission's legal action. Similarly, in November 2005, the Commission had forced the Spanish government to give up its golden share in the other telecommunications' major player in the Iberian Peninsula, the Spanish telecoms giant Telefónica.|$|E

25|$|When, on 3 June 1947, United Kingdom {{accepted}} {{demands for}} a partition and announced its intention to quit India within a short period, the Maharaja of Travancore desired to declare himself independent. Supported by the Diwan, C. P., Chithira Thirunal issued a declaration of independence on 18 June 1947. As Travancore's declaration of independence was unacceptable to India, negotiations were started with the Diwan by the Government of India. Family sources indicate that C. P. himself was not in favour of independence but only greater autonomy, and that a favourable agreement had been reached between C. P. and the Indian representatives by 23 July 1947 but accession to the Indian Union could not be carried out only because it was pending approval by the Raja. On the other hand, noted historian Ramachandra Guha has written about how C. P., egged on by Mohammed Ali Jinnah, had established secret ties with senior Ministers of the British Government, who encouraged him {{in the hope that}} he would give them privileged access to monazite, a material Travancore was rich in and which <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>the</b> British a lead in the nuclear arms race. Nevertheless, an assassination attempt was made on C. P. on 25 July 1947 during a concert commemorating the anniversary of Swati Thirunal. C. P. survived with multiple stab wounds and hastened the accession of Travancore state to the Indian Union soon after his recovery.|$|E
