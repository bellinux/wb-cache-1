(Trematoda: Lecithodendriidae) and Malagashitrema sp. (Trematoda: Homalometridae) respectively. Postorchigenes sp. possesses a body which is oval, spinulate with an oral sucker bigger than acetabulum. The prevalence of Postorchigenes sp. reported from the present study were agreed with the previous studies carried out by Kennedy et al. (1987) who described a three species of digenea from seven species of lizards in Idonesia. Malagashitrema sp. possesses oral sucker larger than acetabulum. The presence of Malagashitrema sp. proved that Malagashitrema is a genus with species linked to <b>Chamaeleo</b> <b>spp.</b> These trematodes adapted to different areas, making their presence are possible in different geographical regions in the world and appears to be a species adapted to <b>Chamaeleo</b> <b>spp.</b> [Kareem Morsy; Nadia Ramadan; Salam Al Hashimi; Medhat Ali; Abdel-Rahman Bashtar.
