Information on stand-alone costs for heat generation {{allows us to}} empirically compare the Faulhaber tests, tests with an upper bound on stand-alone costs (the Palmer tests) and the fully distributed cost test (FDC).

It is shown that the FDC test is closer to that of the Faulhaber tests in its results than the Palmer tests. Thus as the Faulhaber tests are considered in the literature to be the theoretically correct tests, the FDC test is shown to be the best approximation for tests of <b>cross-subsidisation</b> for this specific sector.

40|$|The {{specific}} {{purpose of this}} paper is to estimate the extent to which decoupled payments under the Single Payments Scheme (SPS) are being used (either explicitly or implicitly) in England to support the continuation of activities that were previously supported by area and headage payments. In the absence of a farm survey, the methodology consists of using information on farm accounts collected through England’s Farm Business Survey (FBS), to estimate a multi-output cost function differentiated by farm size and farm type. This cost function, calibrated to match regional prices in England, is used to estimate the level of <b>cross-subsidisation</b> in the first full year after implementation of the SPS (2005 / 06). Results indicate that <b>cross-subsidisation</b> was occurring, which might infer that many farmers across England are coupling their payments.

In {{an attempt}} to provide much-needed finance for road investments, the government’s {{national}} road agency has introduced numerous toll roads {{over the last three}} decades. It is currently in the process of introducing open road tolling on a network of Gauteng’s highways. Economic theory provides a rich understanding for pricing road use, particularly with regard to the pricing of externalities. By quantifying these externalities for the South African case, this paper reveals evidence of gross mispricing for road use. Specifically, the magnitude of road freight trucks’ external costs indicates that there is an absolute underpricing of road use for these vehicles. On the grounds of the externalities considered in this paper, passenger cars should, in fact, face a toll negligible in comparison to heavy vehicles. That they do not points to massive <b>cross-subsidisation</b> and that the relative price between light and heavy vehicles should be revisited. Appropriate pricing will improve economic efficiency by reducing <b>cross-subsidisation.</b> It will also rationalise the choice of freight modalities in South Africa, with the likely effect that a greater volume of goods will be carried by rail.

40|$|The Tanzanian health {{insurance}} system comprises multiple {{health insurance}} funds targeting different population groups but which operate in parallel, with no mechanisms for redistribution across the funds. Establishing such redistributive mechanisms requires public support, which is grounded {{on the level}} of solidarity within the country. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse the perceptions of CHF, NHIF and non-member households towards crosssubsidisation of the poor as an indication of the level of solidarity and acceptance of redistributive mechanisms. This study analyses data collected from a survey of 695 households relating to perceptions of household heads towards <b>cross-subsidisation</b> of the poor to enable them to access health services. Kruskal-Wallis test is used to compare perceptions by membership status. Generalized ordinal logistic regression models are used to identify factors associated with support for <b>cross-subsidisation</b> of the poor. Compared to CHF and NHIF households, non-member households expressed the highest support for subsidised CHF membership for the poor. The odds of expressing support for subsidised CHF membership are higher for NHIF households and non-member households, households that are wealthier, whose household heads have lower education levels, and have sick members. The majority of households support a partial rather than fully subsidised CHF membership for the poor and there were no significant differences by membership status. The odds of expressing willingness to contribute towards subsidised CHF membership are higher for households that are wealthier, with young household heads and have confidence in scheme management. The majority may support a redistributive policy, but there are indications that this support and willingness to contribute to its achievement are influenced by the perceived benefits, amount of subsidy considered, and trust in scheme management. These present important issues for consideration when designing redistributive policies...|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies on}} the future of social {{security}} systems in a unified Europe treat the issue as merely a particular aspect of the broader question of redistribution within a federation with mobile agents. As a result, such studies typically recommend their gradual centralisation.

In this analytical framework competition between public insurance systems can generate efficiency. It can also remain compatible with <b>cross-subsidisation</b> if the proportion of low risks is sufficiently large. The result depends on the relative proportion of high risks, on the goals of the national social security systems, and on their behaviour when competing with each over. ...|$|E

It argues that users of ROCE indicators are likely to lack financial sophistication and to want to compare performance between entities, so that indicators should be clear, readily understandable and comparable.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Equity and {{universal}} coverage currently dominate policy debates worldwide. Health financing approaches {{are central to}} universal coverage. The way funds are collected, pooled, and used to purchase or provide services should be carefully considered to ensure that population needs are addressed under a universal health system. The aim {{of this paper is}} to assess the extent to which the Kenyan health financing system meets the key requirements for universal coverage, including income and risk <b>cross-subsidisation.</b> Recommendations on how to address existing equity challenges and progress towards universal coverage are made. Methods An extensive review of published and gray literature was conducted to identify the sources of health care funds in Kenya. Documents were mainly sourced from the Ministry of Medical Services and the Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation. Country level documents were the main sources of data. In cases where data were not available at the country level, they were sought from the World Health Organisation website. Each financing mechanism was analysed in respect to key functions namely, revenue generation, pooling and purchasing. Results The Kenyan health sector relies heavily on out-of-pocket payments. Government funds are mainly allocated through historical incremental approach. The sector is largely underfunded and health care contributions are regressive (i. e. the poor contribute a larger proportion of their income to health care than the rich). Health financing in Kenya is fragmented and there is very limited risk and income <b>cross-subsidisation.</b> The country has made little progress towards achieving international benchmarks including the Abuja target of allocating 15 % of government's budget to the health sector. Conclusions The Kenyan health system is highly inequitable and policies aimed at promoting equity and addressing the needs of the poor and vulnerable have not been successful. Some progress has been made towards addressing equity challenges, but universal coverage will not be achieved unless the country adopts a systemic approach to health financing reforms. Such an approach should be informed by the wider health system goals of equity and efficiency. </p...|$|E

Coverage of hybridity includes both established housing providers and emergent third sector organisations including finance consolidators, development consortia and <b>cross-subsidisation</b> vehicles. Using information from interviews, organisational case studies and documentation, this paper assesses the drivers for the growth of hybridity in Australia. The policy implications for governments steering a diverse housing sector through promoting hybrid organisations are discussed, and reflections are provided on the opportunities and limitations of using hybridity analytical frameworks. An issue to emerge from the analysis is the diversity of organisational forms, financing models and strategic orientation of hybrid organisations promoted through the same policy settings...|$|E
