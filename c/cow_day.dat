40|$|Vitamin E supplementation {{has been}} {{reported}} to decrease the incidence of cystic ovarian disease (COD) and retained placenta (RP) in cattle however the mechanism of action is not known. In humans, vitamin E supplementation twofold the daily requirements decreases plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) activity. As proteolysis may be involved in both COD and RP, vitamin E may be reducing these disorders in cattle through its effects on PAI- 1. To evaluate the effects of vitamin E on plasma PAI- 1 activity in cattle, six non-lactating beef cows (n = 3 per treatment) were injected with 0 (Control) or 2750 IU of vitamin E (Vitamin E) IM once every four days for 24 days (Day 0 = first day of treatment). Blood samples were collected every two days for 28 days starting on Day 0 and plasma PAI- 1 and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) concentrations and activities were determined. No differences (P > 0. 05) were observed due to vitamin E supplementation in plasma PAI- 1 and tPA concentrations and activities or concentra tions and activities adjusted relative to the Day 0 value for each <b>cow.</b> <b>Day</b> of treatment was a significant effect in all tPA measurements. The ratio of adjusted PAI- 1 to tPA concentrations did not differ (P > 0. 05) due to vitamin E supplementation however the ratio of PAI- 1 to tPA activity tended to be greater (P = 0. 097) in Control compared to Vitamin E cows (1. 0 ± 0. 1 and 0. 7 ± 0. 1, respectively).

Thirty-eight water meters were installed in a barn with 176 cows and two milking systems (an automatic milking system and a herringbone parlour). Their counts were logged hourly over 806 days. On average, the cows in the automatic milking system used 91. 1 (SD 14. 3) L drinking water per <b>cow</b> per <b>day,</b> while those in the herringbone parlour used 54. 4 (SD 5. 3) L per <b>cow</b> per <b>day.</b> The <b>cows</b> drink most of the water during the hours of (natural and artificial) light in the barn.

40|$|Data on 5130 {{registered}} Hereford cattle {{owned and}} {{managed by the}} San Carlos Apache Indian tribe were used to study cow productivity in terms of Most Probable Producing Ability and fertility. Analyses of variance and regression analyses were utilized to investigate sources of variation in the weaning weights of the calves and in their day of birth (which was a measure of cow fertility). Heritability estimates for various weights and gains and correlations (genetic, environmental and phenotypic) for weights, gains and MPPA were also calculated. Large year effects caused the most variation in weaning weight. Important too, were the effects of age of dam, interaction between year and age of dam and regression of weaning weight on day of birth. The repeatability of weaning weight was. 25. This value was low compared to the average usually seen. Heritability estimates for weaning weight were. 05 for males and. 18 for females. Not much progress could be made selecting for weight at that stage. The heritability of postweaning weights were higher. The values for 20 -month-weight were. 46 for males and. 31 for females, indicating reasonable progress could be made selecting for weight at that age. Twelve-month-weight had heritability estimates of. 21 (males) and. 17 (females). Since a weight loss occurred during the period between weaning and the 12 -month-stage, the trait being measured may be a response to nutritional stress. The genetic correlations between weights at various stages were high. Some of the same genes are responsible for weights at various stages of growth. Correlations (genetic) between the weights and MPPA were generally low except the correlation of 12 -month-weight with MPPA (. 41). Day of birth measured as a trait of the calf was a reflection of gestation length. Heritability estimates for day of birth were. 26 for calves of cows dry during the breeding season and. 04 for the calves of lactating cows. When calculated as a trait of the <b>cow,</b> <b>day</b> of birth was considered a measure of cow fertility with a resulting heritability of. 09.

Sterile composite milk samples were collected at the initiation of the trial and on an approximately bimonthly basis throughout the duration of the trial. There was no difference in the prevalence of isolation of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. from composite milk samples obtained during the 6 herd cultures.

These experiments were conducted over consecutive years with 128 high genetic merit multiparous Holstein-Friesian cows in early, mid and late lactation in spring, summer, autumn and winter. At each stage of lactation, and in each season of the year, cows were offered a restricted pasture allowance (25 to 35 kg dry matter (DM) per <b>cow</b> per <b>day),</b> either unsupplemented (control) or with supplement at 50 MJ metabolizable energy (ME) per <b>cow</b> per <b>day</b> in experiment 1 and 80 MJ ME per <b>cow</b> per <b>day</b> in experiment 2. The two supplements given in both years were rolled maize grain (MG) and a mixture of foods formulated to nutritionally balance the diet (BR). In experiment 2, another treatment, of a generous pasture allowance (60 to 75 kg DM per <b>cow</b> per <b>day)</b> (AP), was imposed on an additional group of early lactation cows during each season. Direct milk solids (MS) (milk fat plus milk protein) responses in experiment 1 to MG were 169, 279, 195 and 251 g MS per <b>cow</b> per <b>day</b> in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively, while those to BR were 107, 250, 192, 289 g MS per <b>cow</b> per <b>day.</b> In experiment 2, however, milk solids responses to both supplements during spring were slightly below the control treatment, with values similar to those in experiment 1 in summer and autumn for cows on the BR but not the MG supplement. Milk solids responses to supplementary foods were largest during seasons of the year when the quantity and quality of pasture on offer resulted in the lowest milk solids yield from unsupplemented cows. When carry-over effects of feeding MG and BR on milk solids production were detected, they were only about half the magnitude of the direct effects. Serum urea concentrations were higher in control cows than those offered MG with a similar effect for BR in all but summer in experiment 1, while serum glucose concentrations were highest in winter and lowest in summer. The most important factor influencing milk solids responses was the relative food deficit (RFD) represented by the decline in milk solids yield of the respective control groups after,changing from a generous pasture allowance to restricted allowance when the feeding treatments were imposed. Total milk solids responses (direct and carry-over) to supplements were greatest when severe food restrictions, relative to the cows' current food demand, resulted in large reductions in milk solids yield of the control groups. The RFD was the best predictor of milk solids response to supplementary foods. Therefore, it is likely that cows are most responsive to supplementary foods during or immediately after the imposition of a severe food restriction...|$|R

In experiment 2, a fourth treatment consisting solely of a generous pasture allowance (60 to 75 kg DM per <b>cow</b> per <b>day,</b> AP) was introduced. Offering MG and BR increased DM intake (DMI). At the restricted pasture allowance, increasing total ME allowance (MEA) by offering supplementary foods increased ME intake (MEI) by 0. 68 (s. e. 0. 047) MJ per extra MJ ME offered. This highly significant (P < 0. 001) linear relationship was consistent across seasons, and did not diminish at higher MEA. In experiment 2, cows in early lactation had lower substitution rates than mid and late lactation cows irrespective of season. Substitution rate was higher when higher pasture allowance or quality of pasture on offer enabled the unsupplemented cows to achieve higher DMI from pasture than at other times of the year. These results suggest that one of the key factors determining the intake response to supplementary foods is pasture allowance.

Economic variables included gross milk revenue, feed costs, and income over feed costs. Herd mean milk urea concentrations had a positive relationship with dietary levels of crude protein (CP), rumen degradable protein (RDP), and rumen undegradable protein (RUP) and a negative relationship with dietary levels of nonfiber carbohydrates (NFC), forage:concentrate (F:C) ratio, NFC:CP ratio, and NFC:RDP ratio.
