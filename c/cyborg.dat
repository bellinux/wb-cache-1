50|$|Assuming no <b>cyborgs</b> have escaped, most {{enemies are}} worth the number of saved <b>cyborgs</b> plus one. For instance, {{destroying}} an ordinary enemy after saving 19 <b>cyborgs</b> will accordingly award 20 points. Larger enemies have a point value equal to five successive standard enemies plus 10; downing one such enemy after having captured 49 <b>cyborgs</b> bestows 50+51+52+53+54=260 points. Bosses {{are worth the}} value of a standard enemy multiplied by the number of <b>cyborgs</b> captured throughout the entire stage. If a player was awarded 99 <b>cyborgs</b> throughout the stage, captured every single one, and then defeated the boss, player would receive 99*100=9,900 points.|$|R

40|$|The Automated Turing test (ATT) {{is almost}} a {{standard}} security technique for addressing the threat of undesirable or malicious bot programs. In this paper, we motivate an interesting adversary model, <b>cyborgs,</b> which are either humans assisted by bots or bots assisted by humans. Since {{there is always a}} human behind these bots, or a human can always be available on demand, ATT fails to differentiate such <b>cyborgs</b> from humans. The notion of telling humans and <b>cyborgs</b> apart is novel, and it can be of practical relevance in network security. Although it is a challenging task, we have had some success in telling <b>cyborgs</b> and humans apart automatically. © 2006 University of Newcastle upon Tyne.
