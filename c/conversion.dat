5|$|The Nitta Maru-class {{ships were}} {{intended}} to upgrade NYK's passenger service to Europe and {{it was reported that}} Nitta Maru was the first ship to be fully air conditioned in the passenger quarters. The IJN subsidized all three Nitta Maru-class ships for possible <b>conversion</b> into auxiliary aircraft carriers. Kasuga Maru was the last ship of her class and was built by Mitsubishi Shipbuilding & Engineering Co. at their Nagasaki shipyard for Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK). She was laid down on 6 January 1940 as yard number 752 and launched on 19 September 1940. Sources are contradictory regarding when the <b>conversion</b> occurred and if the ship was completed before the <b>conversion</b> began. Jentschura, Jung and Mickel state that Kasuga Maru was towed to Sasebo Naval Arsenal for <b>conversion</b> on 1 May 1941., Stille, however, and Watts & Gordon say the <b>conversion</b> began while the ship was under construction. This is indirectly supported by the allocation of a new yard number, 888, to the ship. Tully, on the other hand, says that she was requisitioned on 10 February 1941 and was used as a transport until the <b>conversion</b> began on 1 May.|$|E

5|$|A PAT is most {{commonly}} attempted from the two- or three-yard line, {{depending on the}} level of play. If scored by a placekick or dropkick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, and is typically called the extra point. Conversely, a team may elect to run a single play from scrimmage and attempt, once again, to achieve what would normally be considered a touchdown. In such a case, a successful attempt is called the two-point <b>conversion</b> and is worth two points. For the 2015 season, the NFL adopted a rules on PATs that stated during an extra point the placekick must be kicked at the 15-yard line and on extra points if the kick is blocked and the opposing team returns it into the end zone or if during a two-point <b>conversion</b> the ball is fumbled or intercepted and returned to the end zone the opposing team will score two points. No points are awarded on a failed extra point or two-point <b>conversion</b> attempt. In general, the extra point is almost always successful in professional play and is only slightly less successful at amateur levels, while the two-point <b>conversion</b> is a much riskier play with a higher probability of failure; accordingly, extra point attempts are far more common than two-point <b>conversion</b> attempts.|$|E
