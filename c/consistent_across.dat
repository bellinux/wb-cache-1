5|$|Although {{the writing}} of unit names is language-specific, {{the writing of}} unit symbols and the values of {{quantities}} is <b>consistent</b> <b>across</b> all languages and therefore the SI Brochure has specific rules in respect of writing them. The guideline produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) clarifies language-specific areas in respect of American English that were left open by the SI Brochure, but is otherwise identical to the SI Brochure.|$|E
5|$|Type Ia supernovae {{follow a}} {{characteristic}} light curve—the graph of luminosity {{as a function}} of time—after the event. This luminosity is generated by the radioactive decay of nickel-56 through cobalt-56 to iron-56. The peak luminosity of the light curve is extremely <b>consistent</b> <b>across</b> normal Type Ia supernovae, having a maximum absolute magnitude of about −19.3. This allows them {{to be used as a}} secondary standard candle to measure the distance to their host galaxies.|$|E
5|$|After Victoria {{converted}} to alphanumeric route markers the Victorian section was signed as B23. In 2013 the NSW and ACT conversion to alphanumeric routes occurred {{and the remainder}} of the highway (south of Hindmarsh Drive in the ACT) was then also signed as B23. This violates the convention in New South Wales, where numbered routes below 50 are prefixed with an 'A' and 'B' routes are numbered above 50; the violation was allowed so the number and letter would be <b>consistent</b> <b>across</b> state lines.|$|E

5|$|Caroline Island {{is heavily}} vegetated, and most islets possess three ringed zones of vegetation: an {{outermost}} herb mat, typically composed mainly of Heliotropium anomalum; an inward zone of shrub, primarily Heliotropium foertherianum; and a central forested region, typically dominated by groves of Pisonia grandis trees. Coconut palms {{have also been}} introduced and exist in substantial quantities on the larger islets. This pattern of vegetation is <b>consistent</b> <b>across</b> the larger islets, with smaller islets lacking the central forest and the smallest vegetated solely by low herbs. Other common plants include Suriana maritima and Morinda citrifolia.|$|E
5|$|During the {{streaming}} of the series, Silverman {{criticized the}} animation {{because of the}} low lighting levels that might {{make it hard to}} understand. Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator noted the series' high budget and praised the animation style and the focus on details and technology. She was attracted by its premise and expected the quality to remain <b>consistent</b> <b>across</b> the entire series. Similarly, Jacob Hope Chapman from ANN praised the animation for its high quality. Episode 18, which is known for its flawed animation, was improved for the home media release of the series.|$|E
5|$|A 2013 {{study by}} Joseph E. Peterson and colleagues {{identified}} lesions in skulls of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs, which were interpreted as infections caused by trauma. Lesions {{were found on}} 22% of sampled pachycephalosaur skulls (a frequency <b>consistent</b> <b>across</b> genera), but were absent from flat-headed specimens (which have been interpreted as juveniles or females), {{which is consistent with}} use in intra-specific combat (for territory or mates). The distribution of lesions in these animals tended to concentrate {{at the top of the}} dome, which supports head-butting behaviour. Flank-butting would probably result in fewer injuries, which would instead be concentrated on the sides of the dome. These observations were made while comparing the lesions with those on the skulls and flanks of modern sheep skeletons. The researchers noted that modern head-butting animals use their weapons for both combat and display, and that pachycephalosaurs could therefore also have used their domes for both. Displaying a weapon and willingness to use it can be enough to settle disputes in some animals.|$|E

5|$|Drew Karpyshyn, who {{previously}} {{served as a}} senior writer for Knights of the Old Republic, was the lead writer for Mass Effect. Despite of the fact that each of the game's planets had one primary writer, all of the writers involved in the production had to review each other's work and offer criticism. This process of collaborative feedback and individual effort is common at BioWare, and it behoved Karpyshyn to make sure the style was <b>consistent</b> <b>across</b> all different areas. One of the biggest challenges the writers faced was the amount of volume they were required to write to support the game's multiple dialogue paths and story outcomes. It took them three years to get everything into the game, which featured about 400,000 words and more than 20,000 lines of spoken dialogue. According to Karpyshyn, this is roughly the equivalent of 20 movies or 4-5 full novels.|$|E

25|$|Many {{different}} shopper profiles can be identified. Retailers develop customised segmentation {{analyses for}} each unique outlet.

Sproles and Kendall's consumer typology {{has been shown to be}} relatively <b>consistent</b> <b>across</b> time and across cultures. Their typology is based on the consumer's approach to making purchase decisions.|$|E

25|$|For example, voiced stops are {{preserved}} in the Wu and Old Xiang groups, have merged with aspirated or unaspirated stops depending on the tone in Mandarin, and have uniformly become aspirated stops in Gan and Hakka. The distinguishing characteristic of Min varieties is that voiced stops yield both aspirated and unaspirated stops in all tonal categories. Further, the distribution is <b>consistent</b> <b>across</b> Min varieties, suggesting a common ancestor in which two types of voiced stop were distinguished.|$|E

25|$|Most {{scheduling}} is <b>consistent</b> <b>across</b> Australia's three timezones – {{this means}} that South Australia and the Northern Territory sees programming half an hour behind Australian Eastern Standard Time, while in Western Australia programs are seen two hours behind. Consequently, many national news bulletins shown live to eastern states are seen on considerable delay in Western Australia (with the notable exception of The Midday Report, of which a second edition is produced for WA). The time delay can often deny viewers in central and western areas {{the opportunity to participate}} in interactive shows such as Big Brother.|$|E
25|$|Most {{sources of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation contain {{a large number}} of atoms or molecules that emit light. The orientation of the electric fields produced by these emitters may not be correlated, in which case the light is said to be unpolarised. If there is partial correlation between the emitters, the light is partially polarised. If the polarization is <b>consistent</b> <b>across</b> the spectrum of the source, partially polarised light can be described as a superposition of a completely unpolarised component, and a completely polarised one. One may then describe the light in terms of the degree of polarization, and the parameters of the polarization ellipse.|$|E
25|$|Electrode {{locations}} and names are {{specified by the}} International 10–20 system for most clinical and research applications (except when high-density arrays are used).

A smaller number of electrodes are typically used when recording EEG from neonates. Additional electrodes {{can be added to}} the standard set-up when a clinical or research application demands increased spatial resolution for a particular area of the brain. High-density arrays (typically via cap or net) can contain up to 256 electrodes more-or-less evenly spaced around the scalp.|$|E
