Present literatures proved that given six terminal nodes, network <b>coding</b> <b>in</b> space is strictly superior to routing in space in terms of single-source multicast in regular (5 + 1) model, in which five terminal nodes forms a regular pentagon centered at a terminal node. In order to compare the performance between network <b>coding</b> <b>in</b> space and routing in space, this paper quantitatively studies two classes of network <b>coding</b> <b>in</b> space and optimal routing in space when any terminal node moves arbitrarily in two-dimensional Euclidean space, and cost advantage is used as the metric.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{in detail the}} performance of turbo <b>codes</b> <b>in</b> quasi-static fading channels both with and without antenna diversity. First, we develop a simple and accurate analytic technique to evaluate the performance of turbo <b>codes</b> <b>in</b> quasi-static fading channels. The proposed analytic technique relates the frame error rate of a turbo code to the iterative decoder convergence threshold, {{rather than to the}} turbo code distance spectrum. Subsequently, we compare the performance of various turbo <b>codes</b> <b>in</b> quasi-static fading channels. We show that, in contrast to the situation in the AWGN channel, turbo codes with different interleaver sizes or turbo codes based on RSC codes with different constraint lengths and generator polynomials exhibit identical performance. Moreover, we also compare the performance of turbo codes and convolutional <b>codes</b> <b>in</b> quasi-static fading channels under the condition of identical decoding complexity. In particular, we show that turbo codes do not outperform convolutional <b>codes</b> <b>in</b> quasi-static fading channels with no antenna diversity; and that turbo codes only outperform convolutional <b>codes</b> <b>in</b> quasi-static fading channels with antenna diversity...|$|R
