5|$|In 1895, <b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> new Courts Act which {{removed the}} {{remaining}} Indian Territory {{jurisdiction of the}} Western District, effective September 1, 1896. This effectively closed the federal court for the Western District of Arkansas by removing its jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|<b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> new {{counterfeiting}} statute in 1816 when {{it created}} the Second Bank of the United States. In United States v. Turner (1833), interpreting the new act, the Court {{held that the}} offense of counterfeiting was committed even if the signatures forged were those of the wrong bank officers. But, in United States v. Brewster (1833), the Court held that the crime applied only to counterfeit bills, not counterfeit notes.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, <b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> {{resolution}} authorizing President George Washington {{to establish}} a mint. Feeling that the resolution was inadequate, President Washington asked legislators to pass a comprehensive law which would govern the new facility. The result was the Mint Act of 1792, which prescribed the specifications of the new US coins, the highest denomination being the eagle, or ten-dollar piece.|$|E

5|$|In 1850 <b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> {{law that}} gave several states {{wetlands}} within their state boundaries. The Swamp and Overflowed Lands Act {{ensured that the}} state {{would be responsible for}} funding the attempts at developing wetlands into farmlands. Florida quickly formed a committee to consolidate grants to pay for such attempts, though attention and funds were diverted owing to the Civil War and Reconstruction. Not until after 1877 did attention return to the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|Other federal {{government}} agencies also worked to undermine organizations, {{such as the}} CPUSA, they considered subversive: The Internal Revenue Service investigated 81organizations that were deemed to be subversive, threatening to revoke their tax exempt status; <b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> law prohibiting members of subversive organizations from obtaining federal housing benefits; and {{attempts were made to}} deny Social Security benefits, veterans benefits, and unemployment benefits to communist sympathizers.|$|E
5|$|Before Ryan White, AIDS was {{a disease}} stigmatized as an illness {{impacting}} the gay community, {{because it was}} first diagnosed among gay men. That perception shifted as Ryan and other prominent HIV-infected people such as Magic Johnson, Arthur Ashe and the Ray brothers appeared in the media to advocate for more AIDS research and public education to address the epidemic. The U.S. <b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> major piece of AIDS legislation, the Ryan White CARE Act, shortly after White's death. The Act has been reauthorized twice; Ryan White Programs are the largest provider of services for people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Between 1830 and 1832 the Mexican <b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> {{series of}} laws {{that seemed to}} {{discriminate}} against Anglo colonists {{in the province of}} Coahuila y Tejas, increasing tension between the Anglo citizenry and Mexican officials. In response to the rumblings, Mexican troops established military posts in several locations within the province, including San Antonio de Béxar. Although much of the military supported the administration of President Anastasio Bustamante, Antonio López de Santa Anna led an insurrection against him in 1832. Anglo colonists in Texas supported Santa Anna and General José Antonio Mexía, who led soldiers into Texas to oust commanders loyal to Bustamante.|$|E
5|$|<b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> law {{to build}} a {{military}} wagon road on March 3, 1863 from Fort Wilkins to Houghton and then south to the state line. The road was laid out in 1864 following what is today M-26 between Copper Harbor and Phoenix, US41 south to Houghton, M-26 south to Winona and Federal Forest Highway 16 (FFH-16) to the state line. Wisconsin authorities ran the road along what is now Highway 29 between Green Bay and Shawano and Highway 55 north to the state line. Military Road would connect Fort Wilkins with Fort Howard near Green Bay.|$|E
5|$|During Washington's administration, the President {{was given}} broad powers for {{removing}} {{officials in the}} executive branch. <b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> bill sponsored by James Madison that gave the President the power to remove public officials whose appointments mandated Senatorial approval. In 1789, Vice President John Adams cast the deciding vote in the Senate against {{a bill that would}} have mandated senatorial consent for the removal of Senate-confirmed federal and cabinet appointments. The bill had been sponsored by Pennsylvania Senator William Maclay.|$|E

5|$|Five {{days after}} the British surrendered, <b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> {{resolution}} agreeing to erect a structure dedicated to commemorating {{those who participated in}} the battle. Construction of the monument was delayed, however, as the federal government had several other financial obligations that were considered to be of a more urgent nature. The battle's centennial sparked renewed enthusiasm in the resolution and prompted the government to begin building the monument in 1881 amid national support. The structure was formally erected in 1884 and currently resides within Colonial National Historical Park.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, {{following}} {{a study by}} Alexander Hamilton, <b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> joint resolution calling {{for the establishment of}} a national mint. Later that year, in his third State of the Union address, President George Washington urged Congress to provide for a mint, which was officially authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. Despite the authorization, silver and gold coins were not struck until 1794. The Flowing Hair dollar, designed by Robert Scot, was initially produced in 1794, and again in 1795. In October 1795 the design was replaced by the Draped Bust dollar.|$|E
5|$|In March 1794, {{perhaps in}} {{response}} to Shelby's concerns, <b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> measure granting the government additional powers {{in the event of}} an invasion or insurrection. Jefferson's successor Edmund Randolph, who actually received Shelby's letter, wrote Shelby to inform him of the new powers at his disposal, and informing him that the new regime in France had recalled Genêt. Two months later Genêt's agents ceased their operations in Kentucky and the potential crisis was averted. In 1795, President Washington negotiated an agreement with the Spanish that secured the right of Americans to trade on the river.|$|E

5|$|On March 15, Washington defused the Newburgh {{situation}} by {{giving a speech}} to the officers. Congress ordered the Army officially disbanded in April 1783. In the same month, <b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> new measure for a twenty-five-year impost—which Hamilton voted against—that again required the consent of all the states; it also approved a commutation of the officers' pensions to five years of full pay. Rhode Island again opposed these provisions, and Hamilton's robust assertions of national prerogatives in his previous letter were widely held to be excessive.|$|E
5|$|Outside of the Western hemisphere, Hayes's biggest {{foreign policy}} concern dealt with China. In 1868, the Senate had {{ratified}} the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese immigrants into the country. As the economy soured after the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen's wages. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, anti-Chinese riots {{broke out in}} San Francisco, and a third party, the Workingman's Party, was formed {{with an emphasis on}} stopping Chinese immigration. In response, <b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> Chinese Exclusion Act in 1879, abrogating the 1868 treaty. Hayes vetoed the bill, believing that the United States should not abrogate treaties without negotiation. The veto drew praise among eastern liberals, but Hayes was bitterly denounced in the West. In the subsequent furor, Democrats in the House of Representatives attempted to impeach him, but narrowly failed when Republicans prevented a quorum by refusing to vote. After the veto, Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward suggested that both countries work together to reduce immigration, and he and James Burrill Angell negotiated with the Chinese to do so. <b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> new law to that effect, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, after Hayes left office.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{state of}} West Virginia has 55 counties. Fifty of them {{existed at the}} time of the Wheeling Convention in 1861, prior to which West Virginia was part of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The {{remaining}} five (Grant, Mineral, Lincoln, Summers, and Mingo) were formed within the state after its admission to the United States on June 20, 1863. At that time, Berkeley County and Jefferson County, the two easternmost counties of West Virginia, refused to recognize their inclusion in the state. In March 1866, the United States <b>Congress</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> joint mandate assenting to their inclusion.|$|E
