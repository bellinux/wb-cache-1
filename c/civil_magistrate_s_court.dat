Although a proponent of Christian values, Witherspoon's common sense approach to the public morality of <b>civil</b> <b>magistrates</b> was more influenced by the Enlightenment ethics of Scottish philosophers Francis Hutcheson and Thomas Reid than the Christian virtue of Jonathan Edwards. In regard to <b>civil</b> <b>magistrates,</b> Witherspoon thus believed moral judgement should be pursued as a science. In this regard, he held to old Roman Republic concepts of virtue in determining moral leadership in <b>civil</b> <b>magistrates.</b>|$|R

5000|$|It makes a clear {{distinction}} between {{the power of the state}} and that of the congregation. While a <b>civil</b> <b>magistrate</b> is obliged to follow a Christian life, and while the magistrate does have the power to convene a church synod for the purposes of admonishing a church or removing it from the communion of churches, the <b>civil</b> <b>magistrate</b> should have no power within the governance of the church itself, nor compel people to attend. The platform is at pains to say that church government stands in no opposition to civil government. However, this separation of church and state is vastly different from what one finds by the 19th century in America. For example, the platform urges that [...] "idolatry, heresy, blasphemy... open contempt of the word preached, profanation of the Lord's Day... and the like are to be restrained and punished by civil authority." ...|$|R

60|$|If {{there is}} any one thing within the {{competency}} of a magistrate with regard to religion, it is this: {{that he has a}} right to direct the exterior ceremonies of religion; that, whilst interior religion is within the jurisdiction of God alone, the external part, bodily action, is within the province of the chief governor. Hooker, and all the great lights of the Church, have constantly argued this to be a part within the province of the <b>civil</b> <b>magistrate.</b> But look at the Act of Toleration of William and Mary: there you will see the <b>civil</b> <b>magistrate</b> has not only dispensed with those things which are more particularly within his province, with those things which faction might be supposed to take up for the sake of making visible and external divisions and raising a standard of revolt, but has also from sound politic considerations relaxed on those points which are confessedly without his province.|$|R
