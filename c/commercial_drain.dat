40|$|Commercial closed-suctions {{drainage}} systems {{are commonly used}} in the United States and many other countries for use in neurosurgical cases. However, in Tanzania and other developing nations with fewer resources, these are not available. This report explores another option for a closed-system drainage system utilizing inexpensive supplies found commonly in hospitals around the world. Sterile IV-tubing is cut, inserted into the wound, and brought out through an adjacent puncture incision. For suction, an empty plastic bottle can {{be attached to the}} tubing. The IV-tubing closed-suction drainage system was applied in both cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures, including as subdural, subgaleal, epidural, and suprafacial drains. It maintained suction and was an adequate substitute when <b>commercial</b> <b>drains</b> are unavailable. This report illustrates how sterile IV-tubing can be adapted for use as a closed-drainage system. It utilizes inexpensive supplies commonly found in many hospitals throughout the world and can be applied to both cranial and spinal neurosurgical procedures...|$|R
40|$|Open-loop {{groundwater}} {{heat pump}} (GWHP) technology has experienced increased implementation throughout several {{parts of the}} world. Water is discharged into an aquifer for cooling and heating buildings, which {{has the potential to}} cause, even in the short term, significant environmental impacts associated with groundwater thermal interference, particularly in shallow aquifers. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate alternatives to traditional drilled wells for re-injection and dispersion of water in aquifers downstream of GWHP systems. In particular, we evaluated the potential for reverse use of <b>commercial</b> gabion <b>draining</b> in various types of ground configuration, geometry, and interconnection with prefabricated vertical drain systems. Results showed the use of gabiondrains instead of re-injection wells tended to develop a Thermal Affected Zone (TAZ), which primarily affected the surficial portion of the aquifer. TAZ development served an important role in decreasing thermal feedback risks, and reduced the relative distance between abstraction and re-injection in well-doublet schemes, in cases where the abstraction occurred in deeper portions of the aquife...|$|R
40|$|Urbanized {{areas have}} {{environmental}} features {{that may influence}} the development of low-enthalpy geothermal systems and {{the choice of the}} most suitable among the available (roughly earth coupled closed-loop and groundwater open-loop type). In particular, if compared to less anthropized areas, some characteristic urban elements require particular attention: underground extensive use, contamination of groundwater, interference between the systems, authorization procedures and planning restrictions, the competition with cogeneration systems and the impact on emissions of pollutants. In this general context, the increasing implementation in several areas of the world of the open-loop groundwater heat pumps technology which discharge into the aquifer for cooling and heating buildings, could potentially cause, even in the short term, a significant environmental impact associated with thermal interference with groundwater, particularly in the shallow aquifers. The discharge of water at different temperatures compared to baseline (warmer in summer and colder in winter) poses a number of problems in relation to the potential functionality of many existing situations of use of the groundwater (drinking water wells, agricultural, industrial, etc.). In addition, there may be cases of interference between systems, especially in the more densely urbanized areas. Appropriate hydrogeological investigations should be performed for the characterization of the main hydrogeological parameters of the subsoil at the considered site in order to minimize the environmental impact of discharges into aquifers. The current Italian legislation related to withdrawals and discharges into aquifers designs a framework suitable for the protection of groundwater and induce deciding the best configuration of the plant with a case by case approach. An increased contact area between the dispersant system and the ground makes it possible to affect a greater volume of aquifer and, consequently, reduce the areal extent of the thermal plume that develops around the area of injection minimizing the time and the space needed for the disappearance of the thermal plume and the restoration of undisturbed temperature conditions. The reduction in plan and temporal extension of the thermal plume would have several benefits, minimizing the use of large areas around the buildings involved by the thermal perturbation, with direct implementation benefits. In order to investigate alternatives to traditional drilled water well for the re-injection and dispersion of water in aquifer downstream of the heat pump, we modeled with FEFLOWthe possible reverse use of <b>commercial</b> <b>draining</b> gabions in various types of ground configuration, geometry and interconnection with systems of pre-fabricated vertical drains on a possible reliable test-site. The results highlighted that they can represent a good and efficient alternative for the groundwater dispersion in the aquifer...|$|R
40|$|GroundWater Heat Pump (GWHP) {{technology}} has experienced increased implementation throughout several {{parts of the}} world. Water is discharged into an aquifer for cooling and heating buildings, which {{has the potential to}} cause significant environmental impacts associated with groundwater thermal interference. The TAZ is a thermal plume of colder or warmer re-injected groundwater resulting from the common use of well-doublets for groundwater-sourced heating or cooling. Plume propagation occurs primarily through advection, and tends to "degrade" following moving water. Plumes are considered a potential anthropogenic geothermal resource or pollution, depending on downstream aquifer usage (thermal feedback). These risks increase in densely urbanized areas. In fact, where depth to groundwater at a site is very low rising-up of discharged water along the well column could be very dangerous, rendering the dispersion system ineffective, and potentially causing damage to existing buildings and infrastructures in the surrounding area. Moreover, in terms of re-injection after a GWHP plant, increased contact surface between the disperser and the aquifer has other potential heat dissipation benefits. The objectives of this study were to investigate alternatives to traditional drilled wells for re-injection and dispersion of water in aquifers downstream of GWHP systems. In particular, we evaluated by the modeling simulations, the potential for reverse use of <b>commercial</b> gabion <b>draining</b> in various types of ground configuration and interconnection with prefabricated vertical drain systems. The modeling results showed the use of gabiondrains instead of reinjection wells tended to develop a TAZ, which primarily effected the surficial portion of the aquifer.

40|$|Vacant Buildings in {{infrastructure}} projects {{has become a}} serious environmental and economic issue in Indian planning scenario. Several instances of newly constructed unoccupied buildings indicate wastage of financial and environmental resources such as virgin building materials and most importantly land resource. Vacant vegetable markets constructed {{as a part of}} public infrastructure projects by municipal authorities in many cities particularly in the city of Nasik is a glaring example of such redundant investments in Maharashtra state of India. Large scale presence of abandoned, vacant and unoccupied buildings is resulting into an ineffective use of resources and increasing risk to first responders and the community. Vacant and abandoned properties, whether residential or <b>commercial,</b> are a <b>drain</b> on city budgets in addition to detracting from the quality of life, as well as the economic opportunities, of those living around them. They are an impediment to individual neighbourhood redevelopment and, ultimately, to achievement of city wide economic development goals. Minimizing the harm done by vacant and abandoned properties and restoring these properties to productive use are priorities for city planners across the globe. This research attempts to quantify the amount of resources in terms of embodied energy invested into such projects using a case study method. It further evaluates the reuse potential of such built spaces to prompt the meaningful use of resources by investigating its structural capacity and architectural configuration. A spatial analysis with respect to adjacent land uses will also be done to identify the best suitable reuse of the case-study building. Finally, this research draws conclusions to suggest planning strategies to prevent building vacancy in public sector buildings and also reuse strategies for existing unoccupied buildings to evade wastage of environmental resources.

40|$|In 2001, we {{reported}} on a vitamin drain in America’s vegetables (“Vegetables Without Vitamins,” Life Extension, March 2001). What we found in our unofficial report is now official. The Journal of the American College of Nutrition has published new findings from University of Texas researchers showing diminished levels of six nutrients in vegetables and fruits. 1 According to the new report, levels of calcium, riboflavin, vitamin C, iron, potassium, and protein in vegetables and fruits have significantly declined since 1950. This finding holds up even after making numerous statistical adjustments {{to account for the}} losses. The report covers only a few common nutrients; potential declines in lesser-known nutrients like lycopene and zeaxanthin are unknown. When asked about the apparent <b>drain,</b> <b>commercial</b> plant breeders refuse to comment, but clues have emerged as to why today’s vegetables are not what they should be. It {{has to do with the}} way commercial growers do business. FROM FOOD TO COMMODITY Tomatoes that resemble tennis balls, peppers that taste like small rocks, and big, red, flavorless strawberries are all a result of selective breeding for pith and water (pith is defined as the fibrous part of fruits and vegetables, such as the “netting ” around orange sections that is usually discarded). Desirable traits for commercial growers who want produce to ship well, look good, and weigh a lot, but undesirable traits for consumers who buy produce as a source of nutrition. Plant jockeys call it “the dilution effect. ” More water and pith, less vitamin content. The transformation of vegetables from food to commodity is well illustrated by the one people love to hate: broccoli. Broccoli is a terrific source of calcium, especially for people who don’t drink milk. But the most prized commercial version of broccoli is a heavy, calcium/magnesium-deficient hybrid called “Marathon. ” In research conducted by the US Department of Agriculture, “Marathon ” is consistently about a third lower in calcium and magnesium than are other hybrids. And the hybrids themselves are about 50 % lower in calcium than the broccoli listed in the 1998 USDA nutrient database. 2 It has been reported that the calcium and magnesium content in commercially grown broccoli sold in grocery stores can vary twofold. ...|$|R
40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} plants {{are a major}} source of contaminants of emerging concern, as these facilities are the main receptors of these products via household, <b>commercial,</b> and industrial <b>drains,</b> and transport via stormwater runoff. Biosolids are composed of numerous constituents, with a number of environmentally persistent and potentially toxic contaminants of emerging concern identified as present in large concentrations. Research is needed to understand the transport and fate mechanisms of these compounds in biosolids. Additionally, this {{research is needed to determine}} a new priority framework to regulate CECs, both on the national level and regional levels. Wastewater treatment plant influent and effluent treatment regulations and practices may be improved upon as more knowledge accrues regarding contaminants of emerging concern behavior in the environment. The United States environmental regulatory process is a constant work in progress. Inherited from decades-old public health traditions, environmental regulatory programs arose to address the issues of public health as water and air quality issues surfaced. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (15 U. S. C. 2601), enacted in 1976, provided the EPA regulatory authority to protect the environment and consumers’ health against risks posed by chemicals in commerce. TSCA only retroactively addressed chemical hazards, after they had been deemed unsafe and previously unrestricted in the public. A bill to overhaul TSCA, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21 st Century Act (House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H. R. 2576, TSCA Modernization Act of 2015), was passed by the Senate on June 7, 2016 and sent on for President Obama’s signature. The amended law will give the EPA new authority to evaluate the safety of a new chemical before it enters the marketplace. It will also allow EPA to evaluate the safety of chemicals already known to be risks, including chemicals found to persist in the human body and in the environment. The Columbia River is presented as a case study as an example of a significant waterbody with research and regulatory gaps concerning CECs. The Columbia River waterbody was chosen as it represents an important natural resource for which data gaps exist on CEC sources and pathways into the waterbody, and which also does not receive adequate protective regulations under the national regulatory framework...|$|R
