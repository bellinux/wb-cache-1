500|$|Temperature {{has always}} been based on {{observable}} phenomena—in 1744 the degree <b>Centigrade</b> {{was based on the}} freezing and boiling points of water.

500|$|The {{adoption}} of the grade by the cartographic community was sufficient to warrant a mention in the Lexicographia-neologica Gallica in 1801 and its use continued on military maps through the nineteenth century into the twentieth century.

[...] The <b>centigrade,</b> as an angular measure, was adopted for general use in a number of countries, so in 1948 the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) recommended that the degree <b>centigrade,</b> as used for the measurement of temperature, be renamed the degree Celsius.

500|$|At {{the start}} of the twentieth century, the {{fundamental}} macroscopic laws of thermodynamics had been formulated and although techniques existed to measure temperature using empirical techniques, the scientific {{understanding of the nature of}} temperature was minimal. Maxwell and Boltzmann had produced theories describing the inter-relational of temperature, pressure and volume of a gas on a microscopic scale but otherwise, in 1900, there was no understanding of the microscopic or quantum nature of temperature. [...] Within the metric system, temperature was expressed in degrees <b>Centigrade</b> with the definition that ice melted at 0°C and at standard atmospheric pressure, water boiled at 100°C. A series of lookup tables defined temperature in terms of inter-related empirical measurements made using various devices.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 19th century, the {{scientific}} and thermometry communities worldwide referred to this scale as the <b>centigrade</b> scale. Temperatures on the <b>centigrade</b> scale were often reported simply as degrees or, when greater specificity was desired, as degrees <b>centigrade</b> (symbol: °C). [...] Because the term <b>centigrade</b> was also the Spanish and French language name for a unit of angular measurement (1/100 of a right angle) and had a similar connotation in other languages, the term centesimal degree (known as the gradian, [...] "grad" [...] or [...] "gon": 1ᵍ = 0.9°, 100ᵍ = 90°) was used when very precise, unambiguous language was required by international standards bodies such as the BIPM. More properly, what was defined as [...] "centigrade" [...] then would now be [...] "hectograde". [...] Furthermore, in the context here, centigrade/hectograde is referring to the whole 0–100 range, not the given part thereof, hence [...] "20° centigrade" [...] means [...] "20ᵍ per 100 gradians" [...] (or 20% hectograde), not its literal description, [...] "0.2 gradians".|$|E

2500|$|The Celsius scale (°C) is {{used for}} common {{temperature}} measurements {{in most of the}} world. It is an empirical scale.

Because of the 100 degree interval, it is called a <b>centigrade</b> scale. Since the standardization of the kelvin in the International System of Units, it has subsequently been redefined in terms of the equivalent fixing points on the Kelvin scale, and so that a temperature increment of one degree Celsius is the same as an increment of one kelvin, though they differ by an additive offset of 273.15.|$|E

A white protective layer developed during the initial phase of the first cycle was responsible for this phenomenon.

40|$|At higher {{operating}} temperatures, {{the common}} plastic-sheathed pipe system {{cannot be used}} because the maximum permanent temperature sustained by the insulating polyurethane foam is 120 <b>centigrades.</b> Therefore, pipe systems are to be modified and rendered fit {{to be used for}} temperatures up to 160 <b>centigrades</b> in which the polyurethane insulation does not have contact with the pipe through which the medium courses. In imitation of existing pipe systems, four construction types are envisaged which pursue different objectives: a plastic-sheathed pipe with primary insulation from expanded glass (Jabitherm), a currugated plastic-sheathed pipe with a medium-conducting pipe from copper (Aquawarm), a plastic-sheathed pipe with primary insulation from mineral fibre (G + H), and a plastic-sheathed pipe with primary insulation from cement foam (Loegstoer). By means of lengthy shear experiments involving considerable effort, the required long-term shear resistance of Loegstoer and Jabitherm was demonstrated. G + H does not meet the demands on shear resistance laid down in EN 253. Selecting the next higher insulating thickness is the trick for using Aquawarm almost without restriction up to 160 <b>centigrades.</b> The connection technique for a temperature of 160 <b>centigrades</b> does exist, and a 90 -degree bend with primary insulation of glass wool was developed as a new element and tested. Aquawarm permits to offer inexpensive connection to the primary grid. Its only drawback is its lack of longitudinal water tightness at 160, respectively 150, <b>centigrades</b> (orig.) Das uebliche Kunststoff-Mantelrohrsystem kann bei hoeheren Betriebstemperaturen nicht eingesetzt werden, weil der als Daemmstoff verwendete Polyurethan (PUR) -Schaum nur eine maximale Dauertemperatur von 120 C ertraegt. Daher sollen Rohrsysteme, bei denen kein PUR-Schaum bis an das Mediumrohr heranreicht, modifiziert und fuer die Anwendung bis 160 C ertuechtigt werden. In Anlehnung an vorhandene Rohrsysteme werden dabei vier Baulinien verfolgt, bei denen unterschiedliche Arbeitsziele zu erreichen sind: - KMR mit Primaerdaemmung aus Blaehglas (Jabitherm) - gewelltes KMR mit Mediumrohr aus Kupfer (Aquawarm) -KMR mit Primaerdaemmung aus Mineralfaser (G+H) - KMR mit Primaerdaemmung aus Zementschaum (Loegstoer). In aufwendigen Zeitstand-Scherversuchen konnte die erforderliche Langzeitscherfestigkeit fuer Jabitherm und Loegstoer nachgewiesen werden. G+H erfuellt nicht die Anforderungen aus der EN 253 an die Scherfestigkeit. Aquawarm ist mit dem 'Trick', die naechst groessere Daemmdicke zu verwenden, fast uneingeschraenkt bis 160 C einsetzbar. Die Verbindungstechnik fuer 160 C ist sichergestellt und es wurde als neues Bauteil ein 90 -Bogen mit einer Primaerdaemmung aus Glaswolle entwickelt und im Einsatz erprobt.
