50|$|During the Second World War {{the branch}} line {{suffered}} damage from enemy action. After the war {{the cost of}} repairing the war damage with declining receipts led to the decision to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> close on 20 September 1954, the first permanent closure of a Southern Electric line. The dismantling of the station took place in 1957.|$|E
50|$|The station {{opened on}} 26 August 1864. It {{was given the}} name Plunkett on 10 April 1966 in {{commemoration}} of Joseph Plunkett, one of the executed leaders of the Easter Rising of 1916.In November 2016 it was announced the station could lose another rail service that been to Limerick Junction by 2018 as CIE/IE wish to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> save money. The station has already lost a service to Rosslare in September 2010.|$|E
50|$|Hudson's {{first act}} was to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> {{passengers}} west of Milford; despite his line being 4 miles longer passengers now {{had no choice}} but to use it. In 1848 the line west of Milford was closed to freight as well; Marsh Lane station was at that time still a terminus, and so useless for through traffic to Manchester and beyond. Passenger services were reinstated in 1850, but freight continued to run to Leeds via Castleford and not Marsh Lane.|$|E
50|$|British Railways <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> {{passengers}} on 6 September 1965, {{and to all}} traffic two years later.|$|R
2500|$|... 2007 - 30 June, <b>The</b> railway <b>line</b> from Kandos <b>to</b> Gulgong was {{classified}} as 'service suspended' effectively <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> trains ...|$|R
50|$|BR <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> {{passenger}} traffic on 18 June 1962. The section between Yarnton and Witney only remained open to goods traffic until 2 November 1970, when BR closed it completely.|$|R
50|$|The Transport Act 1947 brought {{most of the}} {{railways}} of Great Britain into national ownership under British Railways. This had little impact on the operational circumstances of the line, but the decline in usage became increasingly obvious. The decision was taken to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> passengers, and the last ordinary passenger train ran on 3 November 1958. Goods traffic on the line continued until Friday 7 September 1962. The following day the final revenue train ran, an enthusiasts' special passenger train. The main line was now closed.|$|E
5000|$|One train a week still travels {{along the}} whole Stockport-Stalybridge Line, in one {{direction}} only, with no return service. An {{attempt was made to}} <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> passenger services in the early 1990s (the service having been drastically cut in May 1989 after the re-routing of trans-Pennine expresses from Manchester Victoria to Manchester Piccadilly), but closure was refused by the Department of Transport which ordered that a regular service continue. The train is the only one to call at [...] and [...] The train runs on a Friday as the 09:22 Stockport to Stalybridge.|$|E
50|$|The {{fortunes}} of the Bordon Light Railway were inextricably linked {{with those of the}} Army Camp that it served, so that when army traffic began to decline after the Second World War and the line became a financial liability, {{the decision was made to}} <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> passenger services with effect from 16 September 1957, with the line remaining open to freight to meet army requirements. It might have closed completely had the Longmoor Military Railway been able to serve the Bordon Camp's requirements, but in the event the frequency of services at Liss made the exchange of heavy traffic difficult. This was still the case nine years later when it was decided nevertheless to close the Bordon line completely from 4 April 1966. The Longmoor Military Railway itself closed three years later on 31 October 1969.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>line</b> {{was part}} of the former Great Western Railway branch line between Watlington and Princes Risborough.

The section between Chinnor and Princes Risborough thereafter carried a freight-only cement service until 1989.|$|R
50|$|The Witney Railway {{was built}} through the parish and opened in 1861. South Leigh railway station served the parish until 1962, when British Railways withdrew {{passenger}} services from <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> BR <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> freight traffic in 1970 {{and the track}} was dismantled sometime thereafter.|$|R
5000|$|In 1911 the Great Western Railway renamed Upton station [...] In 1942-43 {{the track}} was doubled to carry {{increased}} war traffic, and the bridges over the West Hagbourne Road and Lake Road were rebuilt.

50|$|The {{planners}} of the Siegburg-Olpe railway {{preferred a}} direct connection to Cologne from the beginning rather than the indirect route via Siegburg.

50|$|The Northampton and Market Harborough railway {{through the}} parish was opened in 1859, passing 0.5 mi {{west of the}} village.

In 1966 British Railways proposed that North Wylam station remain open and that September suspended services over <b>the</b> <b>line</b> south of <b>the</b> Tyne for engineering works, but this proposal was rejected and services restarted in May 1967. The following year BR proposed <b>closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{north of the}} Tyne, this was successful and passenger traffic withdrawn on 11 March 1968.|$|R
50|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Transport Act 1947 the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, the NCC's parent company, was nationalised by the British Government on 1 January 1948. The NCC (and the Ballycastle Railway) was thus briefly owned by the British Transport Commission.

The UTA soon embarked on a major programme of railway closures, notably including much of the Belfast and County Down Railway. The Ballycastle Railway was one of the casualties; <b>the</b> UTA <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> all services on 3 July 1950.|$|R

25|$|The 20th century brought {{increasing}} road competition, {{and this}} led the Great Southern Railways to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> Clifden branch in 1935.
