40|$|Before World War II, Dutch State Mines, the national, {{state owned}} coal corporation, {{was confronted with}} major challenges, {{specifically}} that foreign coal was sold at dumping prices in the home market. At the same time, <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> needed to be improved in order to offer higher quality coal against lower coal processing costs. In this paper we illustrate how State Mines relied on its innovative capacity in order to overcome the economic, technological and market changes. The <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> innovations at State Mines show how absorptive capacity was of prime importance for the firm's innovative capacity. External knowledge acquisition as well as internal knowledge building proved to be relevant, although the balance changed over time. While initially acquisition and assimilation of external knowledge (potential absorptive capacity) were essential to improve the existing <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> processes, internal knowledge building was needed to come to real improvements in <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning.</b> The establishment of a licensing company was essential to exploit this knowledge.

40|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> is a {{technology}} that can solve {{a broad array of}} environmental problems associated with older, state-of-the-art, and future electric generating stations. <b>Coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> provides many environmental benefits. It reduces the concentration of inorganic minerals and elements found in association with coal, some of which are potentially toxic even though they are found in coal in only trace amounts. Currently, more sulfur and related S 0 {sub 2 }, is removed by <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> than by all post-combustion technologies combined. By increasing thermal efficiency and reducing parasitic power requirements, <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> reduces all power plant emissions per unit of electricity produced, including S 0 {sub 2 }, NO{sub x} C 0 {sub 2 }, and hazardous air pollutant precursors (HAPs). While <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> is a mature technology, in the past <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> has only been used for the comparatively simple purposes of removing ash-forming and sulfur-bearing minerals. The application of this technology to H APs control will require a more sophisticated approach, based on a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of trace element removal. The trace elements named as HAPs in the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act can occur in coal in numerous forms. For example, antimony is believed to be present in pyrite, accessory sulfides such as stibnite, and organically-bound; arsenic may be primarily associated with late-stage (epigenetic) pyrite; cadmium is found with sphalerite and other sulfides; chromium may be associated with clays; mercury may occur predominately in epigenetic pyrite; and selenium may be organically-bound or associated with pyrite or accessory minerals such as clausthalite. In addition to a range of modes of occurrence, the range of concentration of trace elements in coals varies remarkably. For example, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) has reported the following range of concentrations for these elements: antimony - ND (not detected) to 35 ppm, arsenic - ND to 2, 200 ppm, cadmium - ND to 170 ppm, chromium - ND to 250 ppm, mercury - ND to 5 ppm, and selenium - ND to 150 ppm...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of ash particles from coal combustion limits it`s {{use as a}} fuel. On mechanism by which small ash particles are formed is the generation of submicron aerosols through a vaporization/condensation mechanism. Previous work has shown that <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> can lead to increased emissions of aerosols. This research will investigate the means or aerosol formation in coals and the effects that various methods of <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> have on aerosol production, {{and whether or not}} cleaning can be performed in a manner that will not lend itself to aerosol formation...|$|R
40|$|Ever-stringent {{environmental}} constraints dictate that future <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> technologies {{be compatible with}} micron-size particles. For super-clean coal production, the degree of liberation needed to separate coal from mineral matter, including pyrite, requires grinding to 10 mm or below. In addition, large amounts of fine coal are discharged to refuse ponds because current <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> technology cannot adequately treat such finely divided materials. This research program seeks to develop an advanced <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> technology uniquely suited to micron-size particles, i. e., aqueous biphase extraction. This technique relies {{on the ability of}} an aqueous system consisting of a water-soluble organic polymer and an inorganic metal salt to separate into two immiscible aqueous phases. Differences in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of particulates can then be exploited to effect selective transfers to either the upper polymer-rich phase, or the lower salt-rich phase.

40|$|Abstract: China is a {{dominant}} energy consumer {{in a global}} context and current energy forecasts emphasise that China’s future energy consumption also will rely heavily on coal. The coal use is {{the major source of}} the greenhouse gas CO 2 and particles causing serious health damage. This paper looks into the question if coal washing might work as low cost strategy for both CO 2 and particle emission reductions. Coal washing removes dirt and rock from raw coal, resulting in a coal product with higher thermal energy and less air pollutants. <b>Coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> capacity has so far not been developed in line with the market potential. In this paper an emerging market for cleaned coal is studied within a CGE model for China. The macro approach catches the repercussions of <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> through increased energy efficiency, lower coal transportation costs and crowding out effect of investments in coal washing plants. <b>Coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> stimulates economic growth and reduces particle emissions, but total energy use, coal use and CO 2 emissions increase through a rebound effect supported by the vast reserve of underemployed labourers. A carbon tax on fossil fuel combustion has a limited effect on total emissions. The reason is a coal leakage to tax exempted processing industries...|$|R

30|$|Dry coal {{beneficiation}} has {{an inherent}} advantage since it uses no process water {{and reduces the}} costs {{that are associated with}} process water, fines dewatering and slurry confinement. In particular, dry coal beneficiation is more suitable for <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> in dry regions that lack available processing water. Meanwhile, the low-rank coal easily conducts the process of argillation when using wet coal beneficiation, yielding the difficulties in slurry treatment and product dewatering. Therefore, dry coal beneficiation is comparatively more suitable for low-rank <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> and upgrading. Countries that heavily relay on coal for energy supply all progressively exploit and utilize low-rank coal to meet the increasing required energy consumption and protect the hard coal resource. Thus, it is imperative to develop high-efficiency dry coal beneficiation to support the utilization of low-rank coal.|$|R
30|$|The mode of {{occurrence}} of an element is {{a description of}} the manner in which an element is chemically bound in the host material. In coal, elements can be associated with the inorganic constituents (minerals) occurring as or in silicates, sulphides, oxides, carbonates, phosphates, sulphates, etc., or with the organic constituents in a variety of less well defined ways (Finkelman 1994). The element’s modes {{of occurrence}} can strongly influence its behavior during <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning,</b> weathering, leaching, combustion, and conversion. Some elements are present in coal both in organic and inorganic forms. These different modes of occurrence will cause the element to behave differently during <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> and <b>coal</b> combustion, and thus will have different environmental and human health impacts (Finkelman 2004). Therefore, information on modes of occurrence of metals needs to be carefully considered.|$|R

40|$|Lead, {{belonging}} to the category of toxic heavy metals, poses {{a major threat to}} the environment and the health and life of living organisms. Anthropogenic sources of lead emissions to the atmosphere include coal combustion, pyrolysis and gasification processes. This metal enters the atmosphere through the fly ashes and gases, causing chemical imbalance in the ecosystem. One way of reducing the emissions of heavy metals into the atmosphere due to the thermochemical processing of coal involves removing impurities from the fuel prior to its use, e. g. through the <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> processes. The removal of heavy metals from coal through these processes is possible {{due to the fact that}} these elements are mostly related to the mineral matter, which is separated from the organic matter. This paper presents the results of investigations of the removal efficiency of lead from coals through the <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> processes in industrial plants. Additionally, the distribution of lead among individual products of these processes was identified. Raw coals, coal concentrates, intermediate products and waste from five plants of mechanical processing of coking coal were analyzed. The determination of the lead content was performed with the use of Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS). Moreover, for all the samples, a proximate analysis and ultimate analysis as well as the determination of the content of main elements of mineral matter were conducted. In order to confirm the mode of occurrence of lead in coal mineral matter, an elemental analysis was conducted with the use of an electron microprobe. The results of the investigations showed that with a significant reduction of mineral matter in the <b>coal</b> <b>cleaning</b> processes, the lead content is decreased, as a result of both, the application of the gravity and flotation methods.
