40|$|Unvented roof {{strategies}} {{with open}} cell and <b>closed</b> cell <b>spray</b> polyurethane foam insulation sprayed to {{the underside of}} roof sheathing have been used since the mid- 1990 's to provide durable and efficient building enclosures. However, there have been isolated moisture related incidents reported anecdotally that raise potential concerns about the overall hygrothermal performance of these systems. The incidents related to rainwater leakage and condensation concerns. Condensation concerns have been extensively studied by others and are not further discussed in this report. This project involved hygrothermal modeling {{of a range of}} rainwater leakage and field evaluations of in-service residential roofs using spray foam insulation. All of the roof assemblies modeled exhibited drying capacity to handle minor rainwater leakage. All field evaluation locations of in-service residential roofs had moisture contents well within the safe range for wood-based sheathing. Explorations of eleven in-service roof systems were completed. The exploration involved taking a sample of spray foam from the underside of the roof sheathing, exposing the sheathing, then taking a moisture content reading. All locations had moisture contents well within the safe range for wood-based sheathing. One full-roof failure was reviewed, as an industry partner was involved with replacing structurally failed roof sheathing. In this case the manufacturer's investigation report concluded that the spray foam was installed on wet OSB based on the observation that the spray foam did not adhere well to the substrate and the pore structure of the <b>closed</b> cell <b>spray</b> foam at the ccSPF/OSB interface was indicative of a wet substrate...|$|R

40|$|In the EU-funded CROPS (Clever Robots for Crops) project {{high tech}} robots are {{developed}} for site-specific spraying and selective harvesting {{of fruit and}} fruit vegetables. The harvesting robots are being designed to harvest high-value crops such as greenhouse vegetables, fruits in orchards and grapes for premium wines. The CROPS robots are also developed for canopy spraying in orchards and for precision target spraying in grape vines to reduce the use of pesticides. A CROPS robot {{will be able to}} detect the fruit, sense its ripeness, then move to grasp and gently detach only the ripe fruit. For crop protection the canopy sprayer can detect contours of trees in an orchard and consequently only spraying on the trees and the precision target sprayer can detect diseases on leaves of vine grapes and only spray pesticides on the affected spots of the leaves. In the CROPS project also attention is paid to reliable detection and classification of objects and obstacles for autonomous navigation in a safe way in plantations and forests. For the several applications within the CROPS project platforms were developed. Sensing systems and appropriate vision algorithms for the platforms have been developed. For the software platform the Robot Operating System (ROS) is used. A 9 degrees of freedom (DOF) manipulator was designed and built and tested for sweet-pepper harvesting, apple harvesting and in <b>close</b> range <b>spraying.</b> The 9 -DOF manipulator is modular, since the joint configuration can be adapted to the applications, e. g. 6 DOF for the <b>close</b> range <b>spraying.</b> For the different applications different end-effectors were designed and tested.

40|$|Even {{builders}} who {{are relatively}} new to energy-efficient construction can consistently reach a target whole house airtightness of 1. 5 {{air changes per hour}} at 50 Pascals (ACH 50) with high R-value enclosures that use a hybrid insulation approach. The City of Wyandotte, Michigan, started a construction program in 2010 to build affordable, energy-efficient homes on lots in existing neighborhoods.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of the {{modelling}} of the spraying of liquid metal which solidifies on an arbitrary surface and of the subsequent growth of the deposit. The new, two-dimensional continuous model consists of a definition of the source involved in the spraying process, the kinetics of points on an arbitrary substrate, including their visibility and the spray's sticking efficiency, and the redefinition of a new surface on the completion of every iteration step. A simple merging procedure is developed to reconnect pans of a curve which become too <b>close</b> during <b>spraying.</b> This procedure produces closed voids, called macro pores, in the deposited material. The model can also predict porosity distribution in the deposited material, defined here as a continuous function of the spray's parameters. The model has been applied in several cases when a spray's parameters were varied, the most important parameter being the spraying angle. The influence of this parameter on shape evolution was determined. The porosity distribution function was calculated for every set of input parameters, and its relationship to the shape evolution was established. With these results one can predict the running strategy in real experiments, in order to optimize the filling efficiency for filling of different initial shapes with sprayed material and to minimize the forming of macro pores...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{experimentally}} {{investigate the}} spray cooling characteristics for active two-phase cooling of automotive power electronics. Tests are conducted on a small-scale, <b>closed</b> loop <b>spray</b> cooling system featuring a pressure atomized spray nozzle. Two types of refrigerants, HFC- 134 a (R- 134 a) and HFO- 1234 yf, are {{selected as the}} working fluids. The test section (heater), made out of oxygen-free copper, has a 1 -cm 2 plain, smooth surface prepared following a consistent procedure, and {{would serve as a}} baseline case. Matching size thick film resistors, attached onto the copper heaters, generate heat and simulate high heat flux power electronics devices. The tests are conducted by controlling the heat flux in increasing steps, and recording the corresponding steady-state temperatures to obtain cooling curves. The working fluid is kept at room temperature level (22 oC). Performance comparisons are made based on heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and critical heat flux (CHF) values. Effects of spray characteristics and liquid flow rates on the cooling performance are investigated with the selected coolants. Three types of commercially available nozzles that generate full-cone sprays with fine droplets are utilized in the tests. Effect of liquid flow rate is evaluated varying flow rates at 2, 3, 4 ml/s.

40|$|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) {{estimates}} that buildings account for 40 % {{of the global}} energy use. The IPCC believes substantial improvements to building efficiency can be implemented easily by improving building enclosures through increased levels of insulation, optimizing glazing areas and minimizing infiltration of outside air. Building enclosure design encompasses {{a wide range of}} parameters but the transport of heat, air and moisture through the enclosure is of primary importance. In predominantly cold Canadian climates, adequate thermal insulation, effective air barriers, and proper moisture control are crucial for energy savings and durability of the structure. For decades, standard construction practice in Canada dictated a polyethylene sheet behind the interior drywall layer to serve as a vapour barrier for assemblies with traditional fibre-based cavity insulation. If the polyethylene sheet was sealed carefully enough it had the added benefit of reducing air leakage. Unfortunately, vapour barriers place the emphasis on the wrong moisture transport mechanism; air leakage can have 10 times or greater the wetting potential than vapour diffusion. Regardless, code enforcement personnel continued (and continue in some areas) to require vapour barriers in all climates, all assemblies, and all occupancies. To do so, they overrule the provision in Part 5 of The National Building Code of Canada that states vapour barriers are not required if it can be shown that the uncontrolled vapour diffusion will not affect the operation of the building and systems, or {{the health and safety of}} the occupants. Foam plastic insulations perform better than fibre-based insulation in terms of the combined resistance to transmission of heat, air and vapour. This research investigated several types of open cell and <b>closed</b> cell <b>spray</b> polyurethane foam insulation in a variety of assembly configurations both in lab tests and hygrothermal simulations. The simulations were extrapolated to seven Canadian climate categories and three levels of interior relative humidity. The goal was to determine which spray polyurethane foam applications required the addition of a dedicated vapour barrier layer beyond what the foam itself could provide. The moisture content of the oriented strand board sheathing layer (OSB) in the tested and modelled assemblies was used as the performance evaluation point because during wintertime vapour drives, the wood sheathing is the most likely condensing surface. Prolonged high moisture content (greater than 20 %) in wood and wood products in wall assemblies leads to mould growth and decay. By this measure, if the wood sheathing moisture contents stay within the safe range (less than 19 %) a vapour barrier is not necessary. The results are presented in Table 7 - 4. The performance of assemblies containing <b>closed</b> cell <b>spray</b> foam was excellent for all climates and humidity levels. Their performance was equivalent to traditional wall assemblies incorporating a polyethylene sheet vapour barrier. The performance of assemblies with open cell spray foam was equivalent to traditional wall assemblies containing no vapour barrier. Open cell spray foam and fibreglass batt both require additional vapour control layers with all but the mildest Canadian climates with the lowest interior humidities. However, in those mild climates with low interior humidities, the only vapour control layer required was a medium permeance latex paint with primer. <br...|$|R
40|$|In an {{experimental}} greenhouse, growing a tomato crop, it was investigated if {{a reduction in}} spray pressure could improve the spray result, while, simultaneously, emission to the ground could be reduced. Spray deposition on the leaves and the emission to the ground was evaluated at different spray pressures (2. 5, 5, 10 and 15 bar). An Empas vertical spray mast with 6 x 2 Teejet XR 8002 VK flat fan nozzles was used to spray the tomato crop in three stages of crop growth, respectively 0. 75, 2. 25 and 2. 80 m height, spraying 500 - 1500 l ha- 1 (stage 1) and 1000 - 3000 l ha- 1 (stage 2 and 3) depending on the spray pressure. Flow rate ranged from 0. 74 to 1. 80 l min- 1 at an increasing spray pressure from 2. 5 to 15 bar. The VMD (Volume Median Diameter) decreased in the same pressure range from 207 to 124 µm. The emission of spray liquid to the ground was measured in the spraying path and beneath the plants between the rows <b>closest</b> to the <b>spray</b> mast. The highest emission to the ground appeared <b>closest</b> to the <b>spray</b> mast, and increased at higher spray pressures. In crop growth stage 1 and 2 about 35 % of the spray volume emitted to the ground, in stage 3 only 15 %. The direction of the nozzles (upwards directed with an angle of at least 400) appeared to be of great importance. The deposition of spray liquid on the leaves was measured at two rows (A: closest to the sprayer, B: the next row behind it) at one, two or three heights depending {{the stage of the}} crop. Highest spray deposition could be found in row A, at the upper side of the leaf and at a higher working pressure. Differences were smaller in the next row and at greater height in the plant.

Significance The product surface coating is a very essential working procedure, especially the surface coating thickness even directly influences the outward appearance and the quality of products. Some factory operators grasp the spray gun to carry on the spraying to the hemisphere surface object,this operation causes the surface distance of spray gunis large to the hemisphere surface object. The rotation of the spray gun makes surfacecoating non-uniform. It is easy to cause the phenomenon of missing spraying,this causes the defective rate to stay at a high level, spray coating efficiency is low, it influences productivity seriously. In this design,we use the chain drive to lead the rising and rotaing mechanism that makes the waiting spraying hemispheresurface objects pass the spray gun work area, in two rows along the straight line, at the uniform speed. By the rotation of spherical surface object, the spraying is made uniform.

In fact, estimated duct thermal losses for single-family residential buildings with ductwork {{installed in}} unconditioned attics range from 10 % to 45 %. In a study of three single-story houses in Florida, the Building America research team Consortium for Advanced Residential Buildings (CARB) investigated the strategy of using buried and/or encapsulated ducts (BED) to reduce duct thermal losses in existing homes. The BED strategy consists of burying ducts in loose-fill insulation and/or encapsulating them in <b>closed</b> cell polyurethane <b>spray</b> foam (ccSPF) insulation. There are three possible combinations of BED strategies: (1) buried ducts; (2) encapsulated ducts (with ccSPF); and (3) buried and encapsulated ducts.

For new construction projects, the team recommends that ducts be both encapsulated and buried as the minimal planning and costs required for this will yield optimal energy savings.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effect of management systems, particularly closing date and paraquat application, on the vegetative and reproductive morphology of 'Grasslands Huia' white clover (Trifolium repens L.) over two successive years in a field mixed (grass and clover) sward situation. More detailed studies involving two different genotypes of 'Grasslands Huia' white clover grown in monoculture were also carried out {{to examine the effects}} of cutting and paraquat application. The mixed sward studies clearly showed that November closing dates resulted in highest seed yields. In grass/clover swards the closing of crops in November accompanied by paraquat spraying to remove grass competition either in mid October or at closing, enhanced seed yield. Later grazing and spraying was deleterious to seed yield unless climatic conditions allowed continued vegetative growth into December. In this latter case spraying in November and closing in December gave high seed yields. Treatments involving closing in September and October and spraying 30 days before, at closing or 30 days after closing, always gave less seed yield than November treatments sprayed 30 days before or at closing time. <b>Closing</b> time and <b>spraying</b> time had a marked effect on seed yield components. The most consistent and major effect of <b>closing</b> and <b>spraying</b> treatments in the two mixed sward experiments was on inflorescence numbers. Other components such as seed set, seed weight, and floret numbers were not consistently influenced by management but did vary according to environmental conditions. Studies on the effects of cuttings and paraquat application on plant structure and on seeding potential and yield of 'Grasslands Huia' white clover clearly showed that there is a partitioning between vegetative growth and reproductive development. The vegetative process was characterised by a high percentage of the nodes on main stolons forming lateral stolons in the winter and early spring. Reproductive development in late spring and summer showed that approximately 80 % of inflorescences were formed on main stolons. Highest inflorescence numbers were produced from nodes formed in October and November, although floral initiation started during late winter (August). The two genotypes used in this study showed considerable variation in relation to reproductive development. Differences of 47 % in inflorescence numbers, 25 % in seeds per floret and 13 % in seed weight were observed between genotypes. The effects of defoliation by cutting involved a reduction in stolon elongation and a general increase in lateral stolon production, particularly when terminal buds were also removed. Both light and heavy cutting treatments resulted in seed yields which were 70 to 90 kg/ha less than the 657 kg/ha produced by uncut plants. The effect of paraquat application was also detrimental to seed yield, mainly through a direct effect on white clover morphology. Although paraquat reduced the amount of lateral branching on the main stolon the destruction of stolon tissue by the herbicide reduced plant recovery and resulted in a seed yield of only 392 kg/ha compared with 657 kg/ha from unsprayed plants. This effect was most pronounced in pure swards of white clover and was less obvious when the grass component of a mixed sward provided some protection for the white clover by reducing the extent of direct contact with the herbicide. Some potential areas for future research and the potential for white clover seed production in Colombia are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Particle {{cycle and}} {{residence}} time distributions in different regions, {{particularly in the}} spray zone, {{play an important role}} in fluid bed coating. In this study, a DEM-CFD (discrete element method, computational fluid dynamics) model is employed to determine particle cycle and residence time distributions in a laboratory-scale Wurster fluid bed coater. The calculations show good agreement with data obtained using the positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) technique. The DEM-CFD simulations of different size particles show that large particles spend a longer time in the spray zone and in the Wurster tube than small particles. In addition, large particles are found on average to move <b>closer</b> to the <b>spray</b> nozzle than small particles, which implies that the large particles could shield small particles from the spray droplets. Both of these effects suggest that large particles receive a greater amount of coating solution per unit area per cycle than small particles. However, the simulations in combination with the PEPT experiments show that this is partly compensated for by a longer cycle time for large particles. Large particles thus receive more coating per unit area per pass through the spray zone, but also travel through the spray zone less frequently than small particles...|$|R

Murray writes that ISM activists were maintaining a presence there since [...] "Israeli snipers and tanks routinely shot at civilian workers trying to repair the wells." [...] In one of her reports, Corrie wrote that despite her group's having received permission from the Israeli District Command Office {{and the fact that they}} were carrying [...] "banners and megaphones the activists and workers were fired upon several times over a period of about one hour. One of the bullets came within two metres of three internationals and a municipal water worker <b>close</b> enough to <b>spray</b> bits of debris in their faces as it landed at their feet." ...|$|R
40|$|When {{droplets}} {{are expelled}} {{at a high}} velocity by a spray, a strong vertical air jet is induced throughout which the smallest droplets are dispersed (their Reynolds numbers associated with their relative motion being small). In our analysis {{we focus on the}} interaction between an external cross-flow and this spray jet. This interaction and the distances by which the spray jet and, over a longer distance, the large droplets are deflected are found to depend largely on the ratio of the cross-wind speed to the induced air speed U 0 =Uj. Using a multi-zone analysis we show that with a weak cross-flow (U 0 =Uj. 0 : 1), in the region immediately below the nozzle the spray entrains the external cross-flow and acts like a line sink; the streamlines <b>close</b> to the <b>spray</b> curve inwards to the centre, while further away the sink flow is weak and the streamlines follow the cross-wind. The external flow stagnates at a certain distance from the spray centreline which depends on U 0 =Uj. When U 0 =Uj & 0 : 1 the cross-section of the spray jet and its velocity distribution change {{in the same way as}} a fluid jet in a cross-flow, whose inertia causes the deflection of the external flow around it and whose surface vorticity causes a pair of axial vortices on the downwind side of the spray.

40|$|Buried and/or {{encapsulated}} ducts (BEDs) are a {{class of}} advanced, energy-efficiency strategies intended to address the significant ductwork thermal losses associated with ducts installed in unconditioned attics. BEDs are ducts installed in unconditioned attics that are covered in loose-fill insulation and/or encapsulated in <b>closed</b> cell polyurethane <b>spray</b> foam insulation. This Measure Guideline covers {{the technical aspects of}} BEDs as well as the advantages, disadvantages, and risks of BEDs compared to other alternative strategies. This guideline also provides detailed guidance on installation of BEDs strategies in new and existing homes through step-by-step installation procedures. This Building America Measure Guideline synthesizes previously published research on BEDs and provides practical information to builders, contractors, homeowners, policy analysts, building professions, and building scientists. Some of the procedures presented here, however, require specialized equipment or expertise. In addition, some alterations to duct systems may require a specialized license. Persons implementing duct system improvements should not go beyond their expertise or qualifications. This guideline provides valuable information for a building industry that has struggled to address ductwork thermal losses in new and existing homes. As building codes strengthen requirements for duct air sealing and insulation, flexibility is needed to address energy efficiency goals. While ductwork in conditioned spaces has been promoted as the panacea for addressing ductwork thermal losses, BEDs installations approach - and sometimes exceed - the performance of ductwork in conditioned spaces...|$|R
40|$|A random-walk model, IDEFICS, is {{described}} to compute downwind spray drift from conventional boom sprayers in chemical crop protection. Spray deposits are computed downwind from the sprayed crop field. The model basically is two-dimensional (2 D), but <b>close</b> to the <b>spray</b> nozzle {{the model is}} 3 D, incorporating driving speed and entrained air-currents below the nozzle. Input parameters {{are related to the}} geometry of the field, to the boom sprayer settings and to environmental factors. The model was calibrated with a set of field trials using an experimental single-nozzle sprayer in a cross wind. In the trials, tap water containing a fluorescent dye was used as the spraying liquid, and downwind deposits were measured by fluorimetry. Variations of boom height, spray nozzle size, driving speed and liquid pressure were examined, at varying wind speeds. Both experiments and simula-tions showed that boom height, wind speed and nozzle size were the major factors affecting spray drift. Surprisingly, liquid pressure did not affect downwind spray deposits at all. A comparison between model results and results of a practical field trial showed a good agreement if field trials were averaged over several replications. The variation between individual replications is however too large to use single trials for model verification. Further calibration trials are needed to investigate the effect on drift of multi-nozzle arrangements, crop height and medium- and coarse-sized spray nozzles. © 1997 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
40|$|Coating {{quality is}} {{affected}} by arc and plume instabilities during plasma <b>spraying.</b> In <b>closed</b> chamber plasma <b>spraying,</b> gradual drift {{is one of the}} intermediate instabilities, which is mainly due to the electrode erosion. This work focuses on the source of the gradual drift of the plasma jet and the influence on coating quality. The ambient state inside the chamber was controlled by a ventilation system and a vacuum system. The variation in the plasma jet was observed by a particle flux image (PFI) device based on a CCD camera. The optical spectrum of the plasma plume was measured and analyzed through an optical spectrometer. The results indicated that the addition of hydrogen to plasma gas induced the change in the plasma jet length and width with changing rates depending on the chamber state and the ventilation power. With poor ventilation, the intensity of Hα emission was found to become gradually stronger while Hβ and Hγ were found to become weaker. On closing the chamber and remaining enough ventilation power, it was observed that the ambient gas slowly turned red. Simultaneously, the coating weight and thickness were slightly decreased meanwhile the porosity ratio was obviously increased. The red ambient gas has been proved to be able to acidify the city water with pH value decreased from 7 to 1 ~ 3. Without hydrogen, the plasma jet was found to be stable without reddening and variation, but the plasma enthalpy was unfortunately low...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to compare the heat transfer and liquid penetration of two different diesel fuels when they impinge on a temperature-controlled wall. The study was performed in a high pressure, high temperature spray rig at conditions corresponding to a direct injected diesel engine. Two fuels were used in this study, a standard diesel fuel and a two-component model fuel. The temperature-controlled wall on which the fuel impinged was mounted at different distances downstream of the nozzle in the spray chamber. It was equipped with four coaxial thermocouples for recording the surface temperature. The thermocouples had a vacuum deposited junction that offered a response time of approximately 3. Recorded time histories of the surface temperatures showed that the two fuels have a similar heat transfer at two different wall temperatures. It could also be seen that wall and air temperature had a great influence on the heat transfer. The spray characteristics were measured with a Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer and high speed imaging. Image analysis showed that the two fuels have a similar penetration even though both methods showed that the model fuel, Idea, evaporates faster. PDPA data show that the axial mean velocity behaves the same <b>close</b> to the <b>spray</b> centre but changes further out. The radial (mode) velocities are mainly dependant on height position for both fuels. The droplet diameter is larger for the diesel fuel at all positions, probably because of a stronger evaporation of the model fuel...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{evaporating}} droplets on a reacting plume {{have been investigated}} using large-eddy simulation (LES) with dynamic subgrid flow models. A countercurrent configuration, in which droplets are discharged downward toward a rising buoyant reacting plume, is used to mimic an idealized small-scale, water-based fire suppression system. Parametric {{studies have been conducted}} by varying the initial Stokes number (St 0) or nondimensional droplet size, volumetric flow rate of the spray nozzle or equivalent mass loading ratio (MLR 0), and initial droplet speed (), independently. The interactions between the two phases are studied in both instantaneous and statistical means. The thermal and dynamic effects of droplets on the reacting plume are scrutinized using the transport equations for the filtered (reduced) internal energy and filtered kinetic energy of the gas phase. New insights on the droplet effects have been gained by rearranging the droplet source terms in the transport equations into physically meaningful terms which clearly represent various contributions due to droplets. Specifically, it was found that only the heat exchange between the phases tends to reduce the gas temperature. All the other droplet-related terms, including the interphase drag and evaporation contributions, are source terms to the internal energy and thus tend to warm up the plume. From the budget analysis of the grid-scale kinetic energy, {{it was found that the}} droplet effects arising from both the interphase drag and evaporation tend to decrease the grid-scale kinetic energy, except in regions <b>close</b> to the <b>spray</b> nozzle...|$|R
