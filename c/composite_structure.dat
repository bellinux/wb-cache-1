25|$|The interstage, which {{connects the}} upper and lower stage for Falcon 9, is a carbon fiber {{aluminum}} core <b>composite</b> <b>structure.</b> Separation collets and a pneumatic pusher system separate the stages. The Falcon9 tank walls and domes are made from aluminium-lithium alloy. SpaceX uses an all-friction stir welded tank, a technique which minimizes manufacturing defects and reduces cost, according to a NASA spokesperson. The second-stage tank of Falcon9 is simply a shorter version of the first-stage tank and uses most of the same tooling, material and manufacturing techniques. This saves money during vehicle production.|$|E

30|$|We {{synthesized}} ZnO NW–CdO <b>composite</b> <b>structures</b> using {{a simple}} two-step process involving ammonia solution method followed by thermal evaporation. SEM and TEM {{analysis indicated that}} CdO was deposited mainly {{on the tip of}} the ZnO nanowires. XRD analysis of the <b>composite</b> <b>structures</b> showed additional diffraction peaks corresponding to cubic CdO, apart from the signals from the hexagonal ZnO. The ZnO NW–CdO <b>composite</b> <b>structures</b> showed enhanced optical absorption extending to about 550 nm in the visible region. PL measurements do not show any band gap modification for the <b>composite</b> <b>structures.</b> The higher visible-light absorption capability of these <b>composite</b> <b>structures</b> can be applied to enhance their photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic properties. Systematic studies are now in progress to explore these properties.|$|R

One {{of the main}} disadvantages of using laminated composite members is the difficulty of inspecting their critical-to-failure regions when undergoing critical loads. Piezoelectric materials as sensors and actuators have transformed conventional laminated <b>composite</b> <b>structures</b> into smart-intelligent ones. For instance, piezoelectric sensors {{can be used to}} assess the critical mechanical deformation while piezoelectric actuators can be used to induce the stiffness in laminated <b>composite</b> <b>structures.</b> Comprehensive analytical and numerical solutions for the mechanical failure and shape control analysis of smart laminated <b>composite</b> <b>structures</b> under complex loads still remain unavailable. This thesis presents a systematic development of novel analytical and numerical models for the mechanical failure and shape control of laminated <b>composite</b> <b>structures</b> integrated with piezoelectric sensors and actuators...|$|R
25|$|One of {{the best}} places for {{building}} a dam is a narrow part of a deep river valley; the valley sides then can act as natural walls. The primary function of the dam's structure is to fill the gap in the natural reservoir line left by the stream channel. The sites are usually those where the gap becomes a minimum for the required storage capacity. The most economical arrangement is often a <b>composite</b> <b>structure</b> such as a masonry dam flanked by earth embankments. The current use of the land to be flooded should be dispensable.|$|E

25|$|In May 1966 the Australian Government, {{responding}} to {{the changing nature of}} international shipping, granted permission for the Queensland Government to construct a <b>composite</b> <b>structure</b> comprising lighthouse, signal station and radar station, on the lighthouse reserve at Caloundra Head. The new structure was part of a pilot station scheme based at the Mooloolah River, and was to serve as a guide to the North West Channel and a signal light for Caloundra Harbour. Fully completed and operational by 1968, the new lighthouse was erected close to the 1896 lighthouse and for a time the two towers stood side by side. Constructed in reinforced concrete, the new lighthouse resembled an airport control tower. A new light that used a revolving table and comprised two stacks of sealed beam lamps was designed and installed. It was manned 24 hours a day and four houses were built outside the reserve to accommodate the staff and their families. A similar signal station tower was constructed at Lytton Hill, making the Caloundra tower one of only two of this type built in Australia. With the Lytton Hill tower being demolished in the 1990s, the Caloundra tower remains the only surviving example.|$|E

25|$|The {{nervous system}} in beetles {{contains}} all the types found in insects, varying between different species. With three thoracic and {{seven or eight}} abdominal ganglia can be distinguished to that {{in which all the}} thoracic and abdominal ganglia are fused to form a <b>composite</b> <b>structure.</b> Oxygen is obtained via a tracheal system. Air enters a series of tubes along the body through openings called spiracles, and is then taken into increasingly finer fibers. Pumping movements of the body force the air through the system. Some species of diving beetles (Dytiscidae) carry a bubble of air with them whenever they dive beneath the water surface. This bubble may be held under the elytra or it may be trapped against the body using specialized hairs. The bubble usually covers one or more spiracles so the insect can breathe air from the bubble while submerged. An air bubble provides an insect with only a short-term supply of oxygen, but thanks to its unique physical properties, oxygen will diffuse into the bubble and displacing the nitrogen, called passive diffusion, however the volume of the bubble eventually diminishes and the beetle will have to return to the surface.|$|E
25|$|Solvent casting and {{particulate}} leaching (SCPL) {{allows for}} the preparation of structures with regular porosity, but with limited thickness. First, the polymer is dissolved into a suitable organic solvent (e.g. polylactic acid could be dissolved into dichloromethane), then the solution is cast into a mold filled with porogen particles. Such porogen can be an inorganic salt like sodium chloride, crystals of saccharose, gelatin spheres or paraffin spheres. The size of the porogen particles will affect {{the size of the}} scaffold pores, while the polymer to porogen ratio is directly correlated to the amount of porosity of the final structure. After the polymer solution has been cast the solvent is allowed to fully evaporate, then the <b>composite</b> <b>structure</b> in the mold is immersed in a bath of a liquid suitable for dissolving the porogen: water in the case of sodium chloride, saccharose and gelatin or an aliphatic solvent like hexane for use with paraffin. Once the porogen has been fully dissolved, a porous structure is obtained. Other than the small thickness range that can be obtained, another drawback of SCPL lies in its use of organic solvents which must be fully removed to avoid any possible damage to the cells seeded on the scaffold.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the present}} Junagarh Fort was built, an old stone fort {{existed in the}} city. This fort was built in 1478 by Rao Bika who {{established}} the city of Bikaner in 1472. Rao Bika was the second son of Maharaja Rao Jodha of the Rathor clan, the founder of Jodhpur city. He conquered the large arid lands to the northern region of Rajasthan to set up his domain. As the second son of Jodha he had no chance of inheriting his father’s territory of Jodhpur or to the title of Maharaja. He, therefore, reconciled and decided to build his own kingdom at Bikaner at the place then called [...] "Jungladesh". Bikaner, though a partly of the Thar Desert, was considered an oasis on the trade route between Central Asia and the Gujarat coast since it had adequate spring water sources. Bika’s name was thus tagged to the Bikaner city {{as well as to}} the then state of Bikaner (“the settlement of Bika”) that he established. The history of Bikaner and the fort within it thus start with Bika. It was only about 100 years later that Bikaner’s fortunes flourished under Raja Rai Singhji, the sixth ruler of Bikaner, who ruled from 1571 to 1611. During the Mughal Empire’s rule in the country, he accepted the suzerainty of the Mughals and held a high position of an army general in the court of Emperor Akbar and his son Emperor Jahangir. His successful war exploits by way of winning half of Mewar kingdom won him accolades and rewards from the Mughal emperors. He was gifted the jagirs (lands) of Gujarat and Burhanpur. With the large revenue earned from these jagirs, he built the Junagarh fort on a plain land, which has an average elevation of [...] The formal foundation ceremony for the fort was held on 17 February 1589 and the fort was completed on 17 January 1594. Raja Rai Singhji, was an expert in arts and architecture and the knowledge that he acquired during his several sojourns to several countries are amply reflected in the numerous monuments he built in the Junagarh fort. Thus the fort, a <b>composite</b> <b>structure,</b> became an outstanding example of architecture and a unique centre of art, amidst the Thar desert.|$|E

2500|$|Some Precambrian (Ediacaran) organisms {{produced}} tough but non-mineralized outer shells, while others, such as Cloudina, had a calcified exoskeleton, but mineralized skeletons did {{not become}} common {{until the beginning of}} the Cambrian period, with the rise of the [...] "small shelly fauna". Just after the base of the Cambrian, these miniature fossils become diverse and abundant – this abruptness may be an illusion, since the chemical conditions which preserved the small shellies appeared at the same time. Most other shell-forming organisms appear during the Cambrian period, with the Bryozoans being the only calcifying phylum to appear later, in the Ordovician. The sudden appearance of shells has been linked to a change in ocean chemistry which made the calcium compounds of which the shells are constructed stable enough to be precipitated into a shell. However this is unlikely to be a sufficient cause, as the main construction cost of shells is in creating the proteins and polysaccharides required for the shell's <b>composite</b> <b>structure,</b> not in the precipitation of the mineral components. Skeletonization also appeared at almost exactly the same time that animals started burrowing to avoid predation, and one of the earliest exoskeletons was made of glued-together mineral flakes, suggesting that skeletonization was likewise a response to increased pressure from predators.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTraditional ceramic-based, {{high-temperature}} electrode materials (e. g., lanthanum chromate) {{are severely}} limited {{due to their}} conditional electrical conductivity and poor stability under harsh circumstances. Advanced <b>composite</b> <b>structures</b> based on vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) and high-temperature ceramics are expected to address this grand challenge, in which ceramic serves as a shielding layer protecting the VACNTs from the oxidation and erosive environment, while the VACNTs work as a conductor. However, {{it is still a}} great challenge to fabricate VACNT/ceramic <b>composite</b> <b>structures</b> due to the limited diffusion of ceramics inside the VACNT arrays. In this work, we report on the controllable fabrication of infiltrated (and noninfiltrated) VACNT/silicon <b>composite</b> <b>structures</b> via thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [and laser-assisted CVD]. In laser-assisted CVD, low-crystalline silicon (Si) was quickly deposited at the VACNT subsurfaces/surfaces followed by the formation of high-crystalline Si layers, thus resulting in noninfiltrated <b>composite</b> <b>structures.</b> Unlike laser-assisted CVD, thermal CVD activated the precursors inside and outside the VACNTs simultaneously, which realized uniform infiltrated VACNT/Si <b>composite</b> <b>structures.</b> The growth mechanisms for infiltrated and noninfiltrated VACNT/ceramic composites, which we attributed to the different temperature distributions and gas diffusion mechanism in VACNTs, were investigated. More importantly, the as-farbicated <b>composite</b> <b>structures</b> exhibited excellent multifunctional properties, such as excellent antioxidative ability (up to 1100 °C), high thermal stability (up to 1400 °C), good high velocity hot gas erosion resistance, and good electrical conductivity (∼ 8. 95 Sm– 1 at 823 K).
