UV provides unob-servability of communication by hiding {{the fact that}} there is a conversation taking place.

We evaluate the influence of the <b>constant</b> traffic <b>generation</b> on the general performance of UV with experiments on the In-ternet and in a wireless setting simulated with network sim-ulator NS 2.

Assuming a <b>constant</b> <b>generation</b> rate and bimolecular recombination, the results are numerically modeled within the drift-diffusion approximation. Bimolecular recombination is found to be a dominant factor in the field dependence of the photocurrent in the entire measured voltage range. Inclusion of field dependent geminate pair dissociation and recombination via the Onsager expressions gives a much stronger field dependence than experimentally observed.

30|$|In addition, {{technological}} advances {{in other fields}} have also accelerated the development of synthetic DNA structures [12 – 16]. Among a range of techniques, an enzymatic approach has benefitted a massive replication of DNA and efficient synthesis of DNA constructs [17 – 22]. In particular, rolling circle amplification (RCA) has been widely exploited because of its simple process and high efficiency in DNA polymerization [23]. RCA is an isothermal enzymatic technique which allows a <b>constant</b> <b>generation</b> of DNA complementary to circular template DNA. With a reliable reproducibility and target specificity, there has been enormous interest in using RCA for pathogenic diagnosis [24]. In many cases, however, RCA-based detection systems involve reporter molecules [25, 26] or gold nanoparticles [27, 28] for visualization of RCA products.|$|E

Under simulations the excess carrier generation function is described by the rigid cylinder with the <b>constant</b> <b>generation</b> rate inside it. The dependence of maximum contrast value on the precipitate depth, diffusion length and effective beam radius is calculated. The XBIC contrast profile {{as a function of}} diffusion length, of beam radius and of precipitate depth has been calculated that allows to evaluate the spatial resolution of the technique. The results obtained are compared with those calculated for the EBIC contrast of the same defect.

In this paper, we describe a new approach of <b>constant</b> <b>generation</b> using Differential Evolution (DE), which is a simple real-valued GA that has proven to be robust and efficient on parameter optimization problems.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mitochondria are the {{powerhouse}} of mammalian {{cells and}} {{the main source of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with oxygen consumption. In addition, they also play a strategic role in controlling the fate of cells through regulation of death pathways. Mitochondrial ROS production fulfills a signaling role through regulation of redox pathways, but also contributes to mitochondrial damage in a number of pathological states. SCOPE OF REVIEW: Mitochondria are exposed to the <b>constant</b> <b>generation</b> of oxidant species, and yet the organelle remains functional due to the existence of an armamentarium of antioxidant defense systems aimed to repair oxidative damage, of which mitochondrial glutathione (mGSH) is of particular relevance. Thus, the aim of the review is to cover the regulation of mGSH and its role in disease. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Cumulating evidence over recent years has demonstrated the essential role for mGSH in mitochondrial physiology and disease.

40|$|AbstractResearch {{regarding}} the optimal planning of distributed generation is {{often based on}} coarse energy use and generation data, which does not accurately reflect real variations in energy profiles. This paper investigates {{the impact of this}} lack of temporal variation on the optimal planning of distributed generation. The problem of loss minimization in the residential setting is used as a guideline. The outcomes of a stochastic optimization model for energy profiles defined on different time aggregation levels are compared. At first glance, modeling on a finer time scale seems to affect optimal planning solutions, with a shift from variable stochastic sources to sources that provide <b>constant</b> <b>generation.</b> However, {{it turns out that the}} gains of using these new optimal solutions in terms of reducing energy losses are limited. The results suggest that for optimization purposes it is not necessary to use data at a resolution smaller than hourly time steps. If energy profiles are defined on time steps smaller than one hour it is important that the full range of the stochastic fluctuations is taken into account, rather than evaluating a couple of scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Spatial burnout {{calculations}} {{have been}} made of two types of water moderated cylindrical reactor using boron as a burnable poison to increase reactor life. Specific reactors studied were {{a version of the}} Submarine Advanced Reactor (sAR) and a supercritical water reactor (SCW). Burnout characteristics such as reactivity excursion, neutron-flux and heat-generation distributions, and uranium and boron distributions have been determined for core lives corresponding to a burnup of approximately 7 kilograms of fully enriched uranium. All reactivity calculations have been based on the actual nonuniform distribution of absorbers existing during intervals of core life. Spatial burnout of uranium and boron and spatial build-up of fission products and equilibrium xenon have been- considered. Calculations were performed on the NACA nuclear reactor simulator using two-group diff'usion theory. The following reactor burnout characteristics have been demonstrated: 1. A significantly lower excursion in reactivity during core life may be obtained by nonuniform rather than uniform startup distribution of uranium. Results for SCW with uranium distributed to provide <b>constant</b> radial heat <b>generation</b> and a core life corresponding to a uranium burnup of 7 kilograms indicated a maximum excursion in reactivity of 2. 5 percent. This compared to a maximum excursion of 4. 2 percent obtained for the same core life when w'anium was uniformly distributed at startup. Boron was incorporated uniformly in these cores at startup. 2. It is possible to approach <b>constant</b> radial heat <b>generation</b> during the life of a cylindrical core by means of startup nonuniform radial and axial distributions of uranium and boron. Results for SCW with nonuniform radial distribution of uranium to provide <b>constant</b> radial heat <b>generation</b> at startup and with boron for longevity indicate relatively small departures from the initially <b>constant</b> radial heat <b>generation</b> distribution during core life. Results for SAR with a sinusoidal distribution rather than uniform axial distributions of boron indicate significant improvements in axial heat generation distribution during the greater part of core life. 3. Uranium investments for cylindrical reactors with nonuniform radial uranium distributions which provide <b>constant</b> radial heat <b>generation</b> per unit core volume are somewhat higher than for reactors with uniform uranium concentration at startup. On the other hand, uranium investments for reactors with axial boron distributions which approach <b>constant</b> axial heat <b>generation</b> are somewhat smaller than for reactors with uniform boron distributions at startup...|$|R
