5|$|Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) {{is a heavy}} rail {{rapid transit}} system in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is {{administered}} by the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District government agency in three California counties: Alameda, <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa,</b> and San Francisco. BART is the fifth busiest rapid transit system in the United States, averaging between 433,000 and 455,000 weekday passengers by 2015.|$|E
5|$|Proposals {{to simplify}} the fare {{structure}} abound. A flat fare that disregards distance has been proposed, or simpler fare bands or zones. Either scheme would shift the fare-box recovery burden to the urban riders in San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley and away from suburban riders in East <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa,</b> Southern Alameda, and San Mateo Counties, where density is lowest, and consequently, operational cost is highest.|$|E
5|$|Since 2008 the {{district}} has been adding Library-a-Go-Go book vending machines. The <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa</b> County Library machine {{was added to the}} Pittsburg/Bay Point station in 2008. The $100,000 machine, imported from Sweden, was the first in the nation and was followed by one at the El Cerrito del Norte station in 2009. Later in 2011 a Peninsula Library System machine was added at the Millbrae Station.|$|E
5|$|The San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District is {{a special}} {{district}} consisting of Alameda County, <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa</b> County, and the City and County of San Francisco. San Mateo County, which hosts six BART stations, {{is not part of}} the BART District. A nine-member elected Board of Directors represents nine districts. BART has its own police force.|$|E
5|$|The primary arrestee in the case, Phillip Greg Garrido, {{was born}} in <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa</b> County, California, on April 5, 1951. He grew up in Brentwood, where he {{graduated}} from Liberty High School in 1969. In 1972, Garrido {{was arrested and charged}} with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, but the case did not go to trial after the girl declined to testify.|$|E
5|$|At Leavenworth, Garrido met Nancy Bocanegrathe {{secondary}} arrestee in Dugard's kidnapping who {{was visiting}} another prisoner, her uncle. On October 5, 1981, he and Bocanegra were married at Leavenworth. On January 22, 1988, Garrido {{was released from}} Leavenworth to Nevada State Prison, where he served seven months of a five-years-to-life Nevada sentence. He was transferred to federal parole authorities in <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa</b> on August 26, 1988. In Antioch, the Garridos lived {{in the home of}} his elderly mother, who suffered from dementia. As a parolee, he was monitored, later wore a GPS-enabled ankle bracelet, and was visited many times by parole officers, local sheriff's deputies, and federal agents.|$|E
5|$|BART's {{rapid transit}} system has 45 stations: 16 on the surface, 14 elevated, and 15 {{underground}} (i.e. subway). Nineteen stations are in Alameda County, eleven are in <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa,</b> and eight are in San Francisco. Six stations are in San Mateo County, though {{the county is}} not part of SF BART district. Warm Springs is the southernmost station and Pittsburg/Bay Point is the northernmost. , Embarcadero has the highest ridership and North Concord/Martinez the lowest. An additional station, the Oakland International Airport station, is on BART's separate AGT Coliseum–Oakland International Airport line.|$|E
5|$|Locally, {{many of the}} {{regional}} governmental agencies and districts recognize the nine counties that border the San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun estuaries {{as part of the}} Bay Area: Alameda, <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa,</b> Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma counties. These agencies include the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board, Bay Area Air Quality Management District, the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and the Association of Bay Area Governments, the latter two of which partner to deliver a Bay Area Census using the nine-county definition.|$|E
5|$|Two bascule bridges—the Paintersville Bridge and Isleton Bridge—replaced {{the free}} ferries in 1923, and {{are of a}} type {{patented}} by Joseph B. Strauss, {{who went on to}} design the Golden Gate Bridge. Local businessmen Aven Hanford and Oscar Klatt replaced the toll ferry with the tolled Antioch Bridge in mid-1926, almost a year before they opened the larger Carquinez Bridge to the west. The counties of <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa</b> and Sacramento organized a joint highway district in November 1925 to fund an improvement of the northern approach from Rio Vista; the concrete highway was completed in July 1927, creating a fully paved continuous route between Sacramento and the bay.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Garridos arrived at their home in an unincorporated area in <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa</b> County, they had removed Dugard's clothing, leaving only a butterfly-shaped ring that she hid from them for the next 18 years. Taking her from their car onto their property, Garrido placed a blanket over Dugard's head and ushered her into an area of his {{backyard}} where sheds and storage units stood, placing her inside a tiny one that was soundproofed. After he finished raping {{her for the first}} time he left her naked in the structure, which he bolted shut, warning her that Doberman Pinschers were outside and trained to attack her if she tried to escape. Garrido would visit her in the structure, bringing her food and milkshakes, and talking to her.|$|E
5|$|In Alameda County, {{the freeway}} {{begins in the}} city of Fremont, where it intersects SR 262, which was {{unsigned}} until 2000. Continuing through the city, it meets Mission Boulevard at SR 238 before exiting the city. Prior to 2002, two ghost ramps existed here, remains of an abandoned freeway project replacing Mission Blvd. Amid Alameda County, it abruptly turns northeastward and enters a hilly area, where it crosses over Mission Pass, and descends into the Sunol Valley, where it runs concurrently with SR 84 for a short while. Afterwards, it enters Pleasanton and intersects with I-580, currently California's longest auxiliary interstate providing access to Oakland and the Central Valley. It enters Dublin for a short segment before exiting the county and entering <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa</b> County.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{entering}} <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa</b> County, {{the route}} meets numerous local roads through {{the cities of}} San Ramon, Danville, and Alamo before entering Walnut Creek, where it meets SR 24. I-680 then enters Pleasant Hill {{for a short time}} and Concord, where it meets SR 242. Upon exiting Concord, it meets SR 4. It then enters Martinez, where it follows the Benicia-Martinez Bridge over the Carquinez Strait, on which the route crosses the county line and enters Benicia in Solano County. On the Benicia-Martinez bridge, I-680 northbound requires a toll, while I-680 southbound is free direction. In Benicia, I-680 interchanges with I-780. It then exits the city and after passing through rural areas routing parallel to the San Joaquin Delta, it enters Fairfield, where it meets I-80, which is the route's northern terminus.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{geographic}} location, non-Hispanic whites make up {{the majority}} in Marin, Napa, and Sonoma counties. Whites also {{make up the}} majority in the eastern regions of the East Bay centered around Livermore and Walnut Creek areas. San Francisco's North Beach district is considered the Little Italy of the city, and was once home to a significant Italian American community. San Francisco and Marin County both have substantial Jewish communities. The Latino population is spread throughout the Bay Area, but among the nine counties, the greatest number of them live in Santa Clara County, while <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa</b> County sees the highest growth rate. Mexican Americans make up the largest share of Hispanic residents in Napa county, while Central Americans make up the largest share in San Francisco, many of whom live in the Mission District which is home to many residents of Salvadoran and Guatemalan descent.|$|E
5|$|Greatschools.com {{awarded the}} school a perfect ten {{out of ten}} score, based on a {{comparison}} between the school's standardized test scores and those statewide; {{it is one of}} the few schools in California to be distinguished as such. In 2009, Dougherty had an Academic Performance Index rank of 905 out of a possible 1000, growing from the 2008 base score of 891. The school was the highest ranked high school in the SRVUSD, the 27th highest high school in the state, and the 744th highest school in the country by API score. In 2011, Dougherty Valley improved by 12 points the previous year with an API score of 921, making it the third highest high school in <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa</b> County as well as the top high school in SRVUSD. Dougherty Valley further improved with an API score of 937 in 2012.|$|E
5|$|On April 22, 1992, {{less than}} a year after her kidnapping, a man called the <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa</b> County Sheriff's Department from a gas station less than two miles from the Garridos' home. The caller {{reported}} that he saw Dugard in the gas station staring intently at a missing child poster of herself. The caller then reported seeing her leave in a large yellow van, possibly a Dodge. In 2009, after Dugard's release, an old yellow Dodge van was recovered from the Garrido property that matched the description of the van given in the call. The license plate was not reported in the 1992 call; the caller, the girl, and the van were gone by the time police arrived. The caller never identified himself, and the police did not pursue the matter any further. In contradiction to this story, Dugard reported that she never left the Garrido property from the day she was kidnapped until shortly before her first child was born in August 1994.|$|E
5|$|At Martinez, the Martinez-Benicia Ferry took {{automobiles}} {{across the}} Carquinez Strait to Benicia, where Route 7, {{one of the}} original state highways from the 1910 bond issue, led north and northeast past Fairfield towards Sacramento and Oregon. The portion north from Benicia to Fairfield became part of Route 74 in 1935, when Route 7 was realigned to the more direct American Canyon route that is now I-80. None of the aforementioned roads were given state sign route numbers in 1934, when that system was laid out, but by 1937 they had been numbered SR 21. This route began at the intersection of Warm Springs Boulevard and Brown Road in Warm Springs, where Route 5 and Route 69 (SR 17) split, followed Route 5 along Mission Boulevard to Mission San Jose (this part later became an overlap with SR 9), and then continued to US 40 (Route 7) at Cordelia. The routing was very close to the present I-680, following such roads as Pleasanton Sunol Road, San Ramon Valley Boulevard, Danville Boulevard, Main Street in Walnut Creek, <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa</b> Boulevard, and Pacheco Boulevard.|$|E
5|$|Western {{burrowing}} owls {{were originally}} {{listed as a}} species of special concern by the California Department of Fish and Game in 1979. California's population declined 60% from the 1980s to the early 1990s, and continues to decline at roughly 8% per year. A 1992–93 survey reported little to no breeding burrowing owls {{in most of the}} western counties in the Bay Area, leaving only Alameda, <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa,</b> and Solano counties as remnants of a once large breeding range. Bald eagles were once common in the Bay Area, but habitat destruction and thinning of eggs from DDT poisoning reduced the California state population to 35 nesting pairs. Bald eagles disappeared from the Bay Area in 1915, and only began returning in recent years. In the 1980s an effort to re-introduce the species to the area began with the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group and the San Francisco Zoo importing birds and eggs from Vancouver Island and northeastern California, and there are now nineteen nesting couples in eight of the Bay Area's nine counties. Other once absent species that have returned to the Bay Area include Swainson’s hawk, white tailed kite, and the osprey.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{planning}} for BART {{began with the}} setting up in 1957 of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, a county-based special-purpose district body that governs the BART system. The district initially began with five members, {{all of which were}} projected to receive BART lines: Alameda County, <b>Contra</b> <b>Costa</b> County, the City and County of San Francisco, San Mateo County, and Marin County. Though invited to participate, Santa Clara County supervisors elected not to join BART in 1957, preferring instead to concentrate on building expressways. In 1962 San Mateo County supervisors voted to leave BART, saying their voters would be paying taxes to carry mainly Santa Clara County residents. The district-wide tax base was weakened by San Mateo's departure, forcing Marin County to withdraw a month later. Despite the fact that Marin had originally voted in favor of BART participation at the 88% level, its marginal tax base could not adequately absorb its share of BART's projected cost. Another important factor in Marin's withdrawal was an engineering controversy over the feasibility of running trains on the lower deck of the Golden Gate Bridge, an extension forecast as late as three decades after the rest of the BART system. The withdrawals of Marin and San Mateo resulted in a downsizing of the original system plans, which would have had lines as far south as Palo Alto and northward past San Rafael. Voters in the three remaining participating counties approved the truncated system, with termini in Fremont, Richmond, Concord, and Daly City, in 1962.|$|E
