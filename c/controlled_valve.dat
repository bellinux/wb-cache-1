25|$|After {{years of}} work, Moore {{was able to}} extend the {{operating}} life of the lamps by inventing an electromagnetically <b>controlled</b> <b>valve</b> that maintained a constant gas pressure within the tube. Although Moore’s lamp was complicated, was expensive to install, and required very high voltages, it was considerably more efficient than incandescent lamps, and it produced a closer approximation to natural daylight than contemporary incandescent lamps. From 1904 onwards Moore’s lighting system was installed {{in a number of}} stores and offices. Its success contributed to General Electric’s motivation to improve the incandescent lamp, especially its filament. GE’s efforts came to fruition with the invention of a tungsten-based filament. The extended lifespan and improved efficacy of incandescent bulbs negated one of the key advantages of Moore’s lamp, but GE purchased the relevant patents in 1912. These patents and the inventive efforts that supported them were to be of considerable value when the firm took up fluorescent lighting more than two decades later.|$|E

2500|$|This engine has {{electronic}} hydraulic activation {{in order}} to increase flexibility with regard to fuel injection and exhaust valve activation. These two factors are adjusted {{in order to}} match operating conditions that a ship may be under. This electronic control of the start to finish of the combustion process is known as the Engine Control System. [...] Fuel injection controls the speed in which the engine will be operating at, while the exhaust valves control the exit of combustion gases from the cylinder. The actuators for fuel injection and the exhaust valves are electronically controlled by the Engine Control System. For fuel injection, a plunger powered by a hydraulic piston is started with oil pressure. Oil pressure is regulated by a valve that is electronically controlled through the Engine Control System. Exhaust valves are opened by a two-stage exhaust valve actuator which is activated by oil delivered from an electronically <b>controlled</b> <b>valve.</b> By controlling these valves electronically, the combustion process is fully controlled by the Engine Control System.|$|E

40|$|Surge is an {{aerodynamic}} flow instability {{which can}} lead to the catastrophic failure of the compressor sys-tem. One way to cope with this compressor flow instability is active control. For a laboratory-scale gas turbine installation, an active surge control system is proposed which consists of a plenum pressure sensor and a bleedhecycle valve. This work focuses on the selection of a <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> More specifically, the required bandwidth and capacity of the valve are specified. To study the influence of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on system behavior, simulations are done with the Greitzer model which describes the behavior of the nonlinear compression system during surge. This model is extended with a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> model which accounts for the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics and the effect of valve saturation. A linear static output feedback controller is used to stabilize the compression system around its nominal operating point. The main contributions of this study are the following. First, a systematic approach is presented to deter-mine the required bandwidth and capacity of a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for active surge control. Second, an efficient control strategy is applied: one-sided control. In this control strategy, the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is nominally closed and only opens to stabilize the system in its nominal operating point. Third, a stability analysis of the constrained linearized compression system is presented. Using the bounded static output feedback controller, surge limit cycles are stabilized in the nominal operat-ing point. Stable operation can be sustained in this point with zero <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> mass flow if disturbances are absent. From simulations, the minimal bandwidth and capacity of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> needed for stabi-lization are determined. Surge point mass flow is seen to reduce by approximately 15 % with the applied one-sided control strategy. Furthermore, it is concluded that nonlinear flow curves of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> are unfavorable for active surge control...|$|R

30|$|The suction end of {{the return}} piping {{arrangement}} was connected to an air manifold with three automated <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> When slurry pH rose above the desired set point (pH 7.0) the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> connected to the flue gas would open, allowing flue gas to be introduced to the feed tank. When the pH dropped below the set point, the flue gas <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> would close and another <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> would open, allowing air in the head space to be recirculated, preventing CO 2 in the head space from venting from the system. The third <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> {{was used as a}} relief valve to prevent the feed tank from becoming pressurized as flue gas was added to the system.

40|$|Case StudyA dry screw {{compressor}} skid was fabricated for offshore service that included oil buffered mechanical seals on the compressor. During shop testing, excessive seal oil piping vibration was observed {{that resulted in}} pipe component failures. The oil system was designed to include a common lube and seal oil system with a pump design pressure of 590 psi.

Vibration and pressure pulsation measurements indicated that the response was at the pocket pass frequency of 206 Hz. The source was determined to be at the compressor. Arrangement of the <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> and <b>control</b> sensing lines were likely contributors to the severity of the response. Modification to the seal oil system included addition of several volumes at strategic locations to change the acoustical characteristics of the oil system to reduce the shaking forces in the pipe system.

This poses a very difficult problem for engines, since valve timing is dynamic and based on engine speed, whereas the pulse timing is static and dependent on the length of the intake runner and the speed of sound. The traditional solution has been to tune the length of the intake runner for a specific engine speed where maximum performance is desired.

40|$|Abstract- Stiction in <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> is an {{extremely}} nonlinear {{and one of the}} long-standing problems in a closed loop control system, since the controller will push the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> to move until the controlled variable reaches the desired value. Stiction moves the <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> to extreme positions so that the process output will force to produce overshoot. Then, the action gets repeated as the controller output reverses its direction. The limit cycle generated, when the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> sticks and slips during a change in input signal is called stick/slip cycle, will induce vibrations. As the control loops in an industrial plant are interlinked each other; these oscillations will be propagated to the entire system. In this critical situation the only option is to go for maintenance of the faulty valves, which may be recommended / possible only during process shut down. But, shutting down the process for maintenance of defective valves is not an economical option. Hence, {{it is very important to}} provide an efficient technique to compensate the nonlinear effect of the stiction in faulty <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> especially when it is not under maintenance. This paper proposes a new compensation approach using sinusoidal signal for the stiction nonlinearity present in such faulty <b>control</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R
