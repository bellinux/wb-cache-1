500|$|Reviewers have {{identified}} several themes in P.T. According to Eurogamers Jeffrey Matulef, the game's main theme is [...] "cyclical mental anguish", {{supported by the}} obscure and confusing nature of the puzzles. Danielle Riendeau of Polygon wrote that P.T. uses two primary themes from the Silent Hill series, [...] "a sense of family trauma and domestic violence and the duality of the 'real world' and the nightmare world." [...] She suggested that P.T. and Eraserhead shared thematic <b>content,</b> <b>writing</b> that both included a crying, deformed infant and that the film's protagonist journeyed from reality into a terrifying world.|$|E

Huff of Popmatters provided a synopsis of the lyrical <b>content,</b> <b>writing</b> that [...] "SOS" [...] is a [...] "classic tale of girl-sees-boy, girl-falls-head-over-heels, girl-dreams-of-boy-so-much-she-loses-herself, girl-sings-catchy-pop-song-about-boy, girl-sells-lots-of-records".

500|$|Ars Conjectandi is {{considered}} a landmark work in combinatorics and the founding work of mathematical probability. Among others, an anthology of great mathematical writings published by Elsevier and edited by historian Ivor Grattan-Guinness describes the studies {{set out in the}} work [...] " [...] mathematicians throughout 18th and 19th centuries"—an influence lasting three centuries. Statistician Anthony Edwards praised not only the book's groundbreaking <b>content,</b> <b>writing</b> that it demonstrated Bernoulli's [...] "thorough familiarity with the many facets ," [...] but its form: [...] " [...] is a very well-written book, excellently constructed." [...] Perhaps most recently, notable popular mathematical historian and topologist William Dunham called the paper [...] "the next milestone of probability theory [...] " [...] as well as [...] "Jakob Bernoulli's masterpiece".

500|$|Lyrically, Eric Harvey of Pitchfork {{compared}} [...] "Discipline" [...] {{to one of}} Nine Inch Nails's first singles, [...] "Head Like a Hole", saying [...] " [...] {{comes from}} a long-established and now label-free artist trying to reflexively reassert his position in the pop landscape, on his own terms. [...] 'Discipline' evinces Reznor's desire {{for some sort of}} framework [...] In relative terms, 'I need your discipline/I need your help' is sure {{a long way from the}} nearly 20-year-old 'Head Like a Hole' refrain 'I'd rather die/Than give you control'." [...] Tom Breihan of The Village Voice reached a similar interpretation of the album's lyrical <b>content,</b> <b>writing</b> [...] "The Slip seems to deal with Reznor's break from the corporate machine, or at least from the numbing conformity-minded forces it represents." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{had more}} mixed to negative {{responses to the}} song.

Brandon Jones of The Global Dispatch criticized [...] "The Madness of King Scar" [...] and [...] "Chow Down" [...] as [...] "a bit too tedious", and felt that the beginning of the second act was too long. Heather Violanti was critical of the song's <b>content,</b> <b>writing</b> that its [...] "disgusting jokes about intestinal worms may drive you mad yourself", and negatively compared it to the Lebo M.-written [...] "One by One".|$|E

500|$|According to Wellek and Warren, {{evaluation}} of literary {{work should be}} done based on the work's own nature, divorced from an author's practical or scientific intent. They reject evaluation based on extra-literary <b>content,</b> <b>writing</b> instead that literature– like all fine art– will provide an [...] "aesthetic experience" [...] which can be judged. They note various criteria used to identify [...] "good" [...] literature, rejecting Russian formalism's criterion of defamiliarization and similar understandings for one based on the diversity of materials amalgamated within a work. They reject a static hierarchy or generationalist understanding of literary greats. Instead, they suggest that every work's rank changes when a new work is introduced and that values within are [...] "really, or potentially, present in the art object". They note a dialectic relationship between evaluating and critically analyzing literature. This ties genre theory {{to the history of}} literature.|$|E
500|$|Rating Charmbracelet {{two out of}} five stars, Barry Walters from Rolling Stone {{wrote that}} none of the songs were bold, that the lack of hooks made the album weak, and said, [...] "Carey needs bold songs that help her use the power and range for which she is famous. Charmbracelet is like a stream of watercolors that bleed into a puddle of brown." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine complimented Carey's mixture of pop and hip hop melodies, and wrote, [...] "Though there's nothing as {{immediate}} as 'Fantasy' or 'My All' here, Charmbracelet is significantly less contrived than 1999's Rainbow and almost as creatively liberating as Butterfly. British columnist Angus Batey, writing for Yahoo! Music UK called the songs on Charmbracelet forgettable, and wrote, [...] "She used to take risks, but Charmbracelet is conservative, unadventurous and uninspiring; and, while it's understandable that simply to make another record marks a triumph of sorts, it's impossible to admire Mariah to the degree that her talent ought to merit." [...] John Mulvey from NME criticized its <b>content,</b> <b>writing,</b> [...] "Nominally, Charmbracelet is R, much like Tony Blair is nominally a socialist...Tragedies, all told, have been worse" ...|$|E
500|$|Alongside its {{critical}} acclaim, {{the series}} has garnered controversy both in Japan and overseas. Amongst the material cited are its demon negotiation mechanic, depictions of suicide and cannibalism, religious criticism, its use and mixture of Christian and occult imagery, political references, depictions of homosexuality, and its sometimes-strange demon designs. Specific examples {{have been cited}} by western journalists. The original release of Persona caused concern due to the title's religious implications. 1UP.com's 2007 game awards, which ran in the March 2008 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly, Persona 3 was given the [...] "Most controversial game that created no controversy" [...] award: the writers said [...] "Rockstar's Hot Coffee sex scandal and Bullys boy-on-boy kissing's got nothing on this PS2 role-player's suicide-initiated battles or subplot involving student-teacher dating." [...] GamesRadar included the series on its list of [...] "Controversies Waiting to Happen", saying {{that the lack of}} public outcry was due to its niche status when compared to other series with similar <b>content.</b> <b>Writing</b> for 1UP.com in a later article, Kalata traced this use of controversial content back to the Digital Devil Story novels, which depicted violence and rape committed by demons, and said that [...] "Such violence is not particularly rare in the land of Japanese animation, but it became even more disturbing in [...] ".|$|E

From the Resi 4 mood of the scarecrow puzzle to the unexpected oddity of the music box level, this is a game that seemingly hasn't heard of DLC – and decides to offer you immense value for money instead." [...] The publication concluded it was otherwise a success. Other reviews noted that it was derivative of other games and that it was unlike the classic Castlevania series. GameSpot's review calls the game [...] "a good start for a series in need of some new blood – so to speak – it's just unfortunate so much of it comes from other games and not an original source." [...] IGN found the combat repetitive but felt the puzzles and platforming provided good pacing. Game Informers Tim Turi praised its boss battles, its magic-based combat system, and its story. GameZone ranked it as the sixth best Castlevania title. The staff praised the developers' success at bringing Castlevania to 3D.|$|E
