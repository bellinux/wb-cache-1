50|$|The {{white-browed coucal}} or lark-heeled cuckoo (<b>Centropus</b> <b>superciliosus),</b> is {{a species of}} cuckoo in the Cuculidae family. It is found in sub-Saharan Africa. It inhabits areas with thick cover afforded by rank {{undergrowth}} and scrub, including in suitable coastal regions. Burchell's coucal is sometimes considered a subspecies.|$|E

50|$|Many coucals {{have a long}} claw {{on their}} hind toe (hallux). The genus name from Greek kentron, a spike and pous for foot {{describe}} this hallux claw. The feet have minute spurs and this {{is responsible for the}} German term for coucals Sporenkuckucke. The common name is perhaps derived from the French coucou and alouette (for the long lark like claw).(Cuvier, in Newton 1896) The length of the claw can be about 68-76% of the tarsus length in the African black coucal C. grillii and lesser coucal C. bengalensis. Only the short-toed coucal C. rectunguis is an exception with the hallux claw of only 23% of the tarsus length. Thread like feather structures (elongated sheaths of the growing feathers that are sometimes termed trichoptiles) are found on the head and neck of hatchlings and can be as long as 20mm. Nestlings can look spiny. Many are opportunistic predators, Centropus phasianus is known to attack birds caught in mist nets while white-browed coucals <b>Centropus</b> <b>superciliosus</b> are attracted to smoke from grass fires where they forage for insects and small mammals escaping from the fire.|$|E
5000|$|Thick-billed weavers are polygynous, in that {{a single}} male {{attempts}} to attract and mate with several females. up to six, and three nest may ne active in any male's territory at once. Where they are found at low density there are many apparently monogamous pairs, although they normally nest in small colonies; more than 100 nests in one South African colony. After mating the female normally will lay a clutch of 3 whitish pink eggs, spotted with red, purple and brown. The incubation of the eggs is carried out solely by the female, lasting 14-16 days and the chicks are fed by regurgitation by the female until fledging, although occasionally the male also feeds the young. The chicks fledge after about 18-20 days in the nest. The nests are vulnerable to predation and recorded nest predators include the white-browed coucal <b>Centropus</b> <b>superciliosus,</b> house crow Corvus splendens and the Nile monitor [...] Varanus niloticus. After the nests {{have been used by}} the wevaers they may be commandeered by climbing mice, or used for breeding by the zebra waxbill Amandava subflava or brown firefinch Lagonosticta nitidula.|$|E
