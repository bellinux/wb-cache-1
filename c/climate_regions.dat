25|$|In {{food and}} wine pairings, the {{diversity}} of Merlot can lend itself to {{a wide array of}} matching options. Cabernet-like Merlots pair well with many of the same things that Cabernet Sauvignon would pair well with, such as grilled and charred meats. Softer, fruitier Merlots (particularly those with higher acidity from cooler <b>climate</b> <b>regions</b> like Washington State and Northeastern Italy) share many of the same food-pairing affinities with Pinot noir and go well with dishes like salmon, mushroom-based dishes and greens like chard and radicchio. Light-bodied Merlots can go well with shellfish like prawns or scallops, especially if wrapped in a protein-rich food such as bacon or prosciutto. Merlot tends not to go well with strong and blue-veined cheeses that can overwhelm the fruit flavors of the wine. The capsaicins of spicy foods can accentuate the perception of alcohol in Merlot and make it taste more tannic and bitter.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{temperature}} control stainless steel fermentation tanks radically changed the wine industry in warm <b>climate</b> <b>regions</b> like Andalucia, La Mancha and the Levante, allowing winemakers to make fresher and fruitier styles of wine-particularly whites. While many producers focused on these crisp, fresh styles {{in the early}} 1990s there was a resurgence in more active use of barrel fermenting whites as {{a throwback to the}} traditional, more oxidized styles of the 19th century. The use of oak has a long tradition in Spanish winemaking, dating back even centuries before the French introduced the small 59gallon (225liter) barrica style barrels. Gradually Spanish winemakers in the late 19th and early 20th century started to develop a preference for the cheaper, and more strongly flavored, American oak. Winemakers in regions like the Rioja found that the Tempranillo grape, in particular, responded well to new American oak. In the 1990s, more winemakers started to rediscover the use of French oak and some wineries will use a combination of both as a blend. Most DOs require some minimum period of barrel ageing which will be stipulated on the wine label by the designations-Crianza, Reserva and Gran Reserva depending on how long it spends in the barrel. The tradition of long barrel and bottle ageing has meant that most Spanish wines are ready to drink once they hit the market. A new generation of winemakers have started to produce more vino joven (young wines) that are released with very little ageing.|$|E

500|$|The long narrow {{geography}} of the South Island ensures that no vineyard is more than [...] from the coast. The cool, maritime climate of the area allows for a long and steady growing season in which the grapes can ripen and develop a natural balance of acids and sugars. This brings out the flavors and intensity that distinguish New Zealand Sauvignon blancs. More recently, Waipara in the South Island and Gisborne and Hawkes Bay in the North Island have been attracting attention for their Sauvignon blanc releases, which often exhibit subtle differences to those from Marlborough. The asparagus, gooseberry and green flavor commonly associated with New Zealand Sauvignon blanc is derived from flavor compounds known as methoxypyrazines that becomes more pronounced and concentrated in wines from cooler <b>climate</b> <b>regions.</b> Riper flavors such as passion fruit, along with other notes such as boxwood, may be driven by thiol concentrations.|$|E

40|$|Purpose / Context – In {{order to}} achieve low energy housing, it is {{important}} to quantitatively and comprehensively determine the effectiveness of energy saving technologies and to evaluate the energy conservation performance of an entire house. Low Energy Housing with Validated Effectiveness (LEHVE) is one of the measures for home energy saving in Japan. The evaluation procedure of LEHVE can quantitatively show the energy saving effect of each technology, such as insulation and equipment, and total energy consumption of a house in the design phase. The LEHVE’s evaluation procedure is not mandatory, however it is widely used in Japan and its outcome has developed into Japan’s Energy Saving Standard. Methodology / Approach – Design data of newly-built houses are investigated using the LEHVE’s evaluation procedure to evaluate the energy conservation performance in both mild <b>climate</b> <b>region</b> and hot humid <b>climate</b> <b>region</b> in Shikoku island, Japan. The present situation of energy conservation performance of newly built housing is analysed using the obtained data of the both regions. In the analysis, energy consumption, energy reduction rates and adoption rates of elemental technologies, such as natural energy application technology, heat control technology of building envelopes and energy-efficient equipment technology, have been yielded. Results – 370 cases of design data of newly built timber houses in Japan, which were obtained between FY 2013 and FY 2015, have been analysed based on the LEHVE’s evaluation procedure. 265 cases of design data were obtained in mild <b>climate</b> <b>region</b> and 105 cases were obtained in hot humid <b>climate</b> <b>region.</b> As the analysis results, it is suggested that the energy conservation performance of the newly built houses has been improved year by year in the both regions. Key Findings / Implications – The energy conservation performance of the newly built houses in both mild <b>climate</b> <b>region</b> and hot humid <b>climate</b> <b>region</b> has been improved year by year. However, some natural energy application technologies, such as wind utilisation or daylight utilisation, have not been widely adopted in the houses even though the both <b>regions</b> have suitable <b>climates</b> for use of natural energy. Originality – Energy conservation performance of housing can be estimated by using the LEHVE’s evaluation procedure. 370 cases of the latest design data of newly built housing have been obtained in Shikoku island where only dozens of data had been available by previous studies...|$|R

2500|$|Amarone {{is unique}} in the wine world. Typically very alcoholic, {{full-bodied}} and ripe-tasting wines are produced in very warm <b>climate</b> <b>regions,</b> where the grapes are able to build up large amounts of sugar while ripening on the vine. Examples of warm <b>climate</b> <b>regions</b> include parts of Australia, California and southern Italy. The Valpolicella region is characterized as a [...] "cool climate region" [...] where acid levels are usually maintained and sugar build occurs more slowly in the vine. Grapes destined for Amarone are the last grapes in Valpolicella to be harvested, getting as ripe as they can before mold and rot set in. The sugars in the grapes are then concentrated by a process of desiccation where they are kept in special drying rooms for anywhere from three to four months. During this time {{over a third of}} the water is removed as the grapes shrivel into raisins. This method (known as passito) produces more concentrated grapes that still maintain the acid balance of a cool-climate grape. Amarones differ from other late harvest wines in that the presence of Botrytis cinerea is actively discouraged, as winemakers attempt to avoid the smoky, mouldy flavors that come with botrytized wine. Extra care is taken in the vineyard to ensure that the grapes are kept dry and harvested before rot can develop.|$|E
