Each column consists of a front key and a rear key, a front lamp and a rear lamp, followed by a front cord and a rear cord, making up together a cord circuit. The front key is the [...] "talk" [...] key allowing the operator to speak with that particular <b>cord</b> <b>pair.</b> The rear key on older [...] "manual" [...] boards and PBXs is used to ring a telephone physically. On newer boards, the back key is used to collect (retrieve) money from coin telephones. Each of the keys has three positions: back, normal and forward. When a key is in the normal position an electrical talk path connects the front and rear cords. A key in the forward position (front key) connects the operator to the <b>cord</b> <b>pair,</b> and a key in the back position sends a ring signal out on the cord (on older manual exchanges). Each cord has a three-wire TRS phone connector: tip and ring for testing, ringing and voice; and a sleeve wire for busy signals.|$|E

When a person prepares to speak, the vocal folds come together over the trachea and vibrate due to the airflow from the lungs. This mechanism produces the sound of the voice.

40|$|Spinal lamina I {{receives}} nociceptive primary afferent {{input to}} project through diverse ascending pathways, including the anterolateral tract (ALT). Large projection neurons (PNs) form {{only a few}} per cent of the cell population in this layer, and {{little is known about}} their local input from other lamina I neurons. We combined single-cell imaging in the isolated spinal <b>cord,</b> <b>paired</b> recordings, 3 -D reconstructions of biocytin-labelled neurons and computer simulations to study the monosynaptic input to large ALT-PNs from neighbouring (somata separated by less than 80 μm) large lamina I neurons. All 11 connections identified were excitatory. We have found that an axon of a presynaptic neuron forms multiple synapses on an ALT-PN, and both Ca 2 +-permeable and Ca 2 +-impermeable AMPA receptors are involved in transmission. The monosynaptic EPSC latencies (1 – 12 ms) are determined by both post- and presynaptic factors. The postsynaptic delay, resulting from the electrotonic EPSC propagation in the dendrites of an ALT-PN, could be 4 ms at most. The presynaptic delay, caused by the spike propagation in a narrow highly branched axon of a local-circuit neuron, can be about 10 ms for neighbouring ALT-PNs and longer for more distant neurons. In many cases, the EPSPs evoked by release from a lamina I neuron were sufficient to elicit a spike in an ALT-PN. Our data show that ALT-PNs can receive input from both lamina I local-circuit neurons and other ALT-PNs. We suggest that lamina I is a functionally interconnected layer. The intralaminar network described here can amplify the overall output from the principal spinal nociceptive projection area...|$|R

40|$|The {{similarity}} in the genetic regulation of arthropod and vertebrate appendage formation {{has been interpreted}} {{as the product of}} a plesiomorphic gene network that was primitively involved in bilaterian appendage development and co-opted to build appendages (in modern phyla) that are not historically related as structures. Data from lophotrochozoans are needed to clarify the pervasiveness of plesiomorphic appendage forming mechanisms. We assayed the expression of three arthropod and vertebrate limb gene orthologs, Distal-less (Dll), dachshund (dac), and optomotor blind (omb), in direct-developing juveniles of the polychaete Neanthes arenaceodentata. Parapodial Dll expression marks premorphogenetic notopodia and neuropodia, becoming restricted to the bases of notopodial cirri and to ventral portions of neuropodia. In outgrowing cephalic appendages, Dll activity is primarily restricted to proximal domains. Dll expression is also prominent in the brain. dac expression occurs in the brain, nerve <b>cord</b> ganglia, a <b>pair</b> of pharyngeal ganglia, presumed interneurons linking a pair of segmental nerves, and in newly differentiating mesoderm. Domains of omb expression include the brain, nerve <b>cord</b> ganglia, one <b>pair</b> of anterior cirri, presumed precursors of dorsal musculature, and the same pharyngeal ganglia and presumed interneurons that express dac. Contrary to their roles in outgrowing arthropod and vertebrate appendages, Dll, dac, and omb lack comparable expression in Neanthes appendages, implying independent evolution of annelid appendage development. We infer that parapodia and arthropodia are not structurally or mechanistically homologous (but their primordia might be), that Dll’s ancestral bilaterian function was in sensory and central nervous system differentiation, and that locomotory appendages possibly evolved from sensory outgrowths...|$|R

40|$|Background. Passively {{acquired}} maternal antibodies protect infants {{from many}} pathogens. With increasing reports of infant pertussis, we evaluated pertussis antibodies in maternal-infant paired sera from 1999 – 2000. Methods. Antibodies to pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), and fimbrial proteins (FIM) were measured by validated IgG-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) in 64 maternal–umbilical <b>cord</b> serum <b>pairs</b> and in 61 of 64 infant sera. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of pertussis antibodies and cord:maternal GMC ratios were calculated. Results. Mean maternal age and gestation were 29. 7 years (range, 19 – 42) and 39. 3 weeks (range, 35. 6 – 40. 9), and 81 % of mothers were white. GMCs of maternal antibodies at delivery (ELISA units/mL) were 2. 4 for PT, 6. 9 for FHA, and 13 for FIM. Cord GMCs were 169 %, 178 %, and 157 % of maternal delivery values for PT, FHA, and FIM, respectively, demonstrating active placental transfer (). Pertussis-specific IgG values for eachP!. 001 antigen decayed to below {{the threshold of}} detection by age 2 months. Conclusions. Despite efficient placental transfer, low maternal pertussis antibody levels and their rapid decay in infant sera leave infants with little humoral protection against pertussis.

Our objective {{was to determine if}} acclimation to water of different salinity has an effect on immunoreactive patterns and staining intensities of the two caudal neuropeptides, urotensins I (UI) and II (UII), in Gillichthys mirabilis. Five fish, originally maintained in seawater, were transferred to deionized fresh water (FW), and five were transferred to new seawater (SW). After 24 hr spinal cords were removed and fixed, FW and SW spinal <b>cords</b> were <b>paired</b> in blocks to receive identical treatment, and cryostat sections were double immunostained for both peptides using a double sequential immunofluorescence procedure. FW spinal cord exhibited increased staining intensities for both UI and UII in their urophyses (the neurohemal organ) compared to the SW spinal cords. The magnitude of intensity difference appeared greater for UI than for UII. In addition, the FW urophyses had more loci displaying intense, perivascular UI immunoreactivity than the SW urophyses. Thus, it appears that environmental salinity has an effect on the urophysial content of UI and UII in this euryhaline fish. The increased immunoreactivity in FW fish could reflect increased synthesis and storage, decreased release of the stored peptides, or decreased peptide degradation. peer reviewe...|$|R

The identity of dividing cells was determined by three-dimensional ultrastructural reconstructions of [3 H]thymidine-labeled cells and confocal analysis of bromodeoxyuridine labeling. The most common cell type lining the central canal had two long motile (9 + 2) cilia and was vimentin+, CD 24 +, FoxJ 1 +, Sox 2 + and CD 133 +, but nestin- and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) -. These biciliated ependymal cells of the central canal (Ecc) resembled E 2 cells of the lateral ventricles, but their basal bodies were different from that of E 2 or E 1 cells. Interestingly, we frequently found Ecc cells with two nuclei and four cilia, suggesting they are formed by incomplete cytokinesis or cell fusion.

40|$|To collect {{cord blood}} samples at birth {{that will enable}} the {{detection}} of respiratory and metabolic acidosis if present following birth. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Umbilical cord pH and blood gas values provide valuable information regarding {{the status of the}} infant at birth; base excess determination quantifies the magnitude of metabolic acidosis, the putative risk factor for central neurological injury. 1 Asphyxia is a condition of impaired blood gas exchange and if not resolved will lead to progressive hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Asphyxia may occur in a transient fashion with no pathological impact, but significant exposure leads to tissue oxygen depletion, accumulation of fixed acids and eventually metabolic acidosis. Moderate or severe newborn encephalopathy, respiratory complications, and complex complications increase when the base deficit is between 12 - 16 mmol/L. 2 An intrapartum event sufficient to cause cerebral palsy may be defined by evidence of metabolic acidosis in the fetal umbilical arterial cord blood obtained at birth with a pH of less than 7, and a base deficit {{greater than or equal to}} 12 mmol/L. 2 Analysis of routine <b>paired</b> <b>cord</b> blood samples for all birth...|$|R

Total arsenic was measured in maternal blood of a total cohort (n= 650) and in <b>paired</b> <b>cord</b> blood and urine of a subset cohort (n= 317). Overall, the geometric mean (GM) of As in maternal blood was 0. 62 μg/L (n= 650; 95 % CI, 0. 58 - 0. 66). In the subset cohort, the GM of maternal blood As was 0. 96 μg/L (n= 350; 95 % CI, 0. 91 - 1. 02); in <b>paired</b> <b>cord</b> blood, the GM was 0. 78 μg/L (n= 317; 95 % CI, 0. 74 - 0. 83); and in urine (creatinine-corrected), the GM was 14. 26 μg/g creatinine (n= 317; 95 % CI, 12. 64 - 16. 09). A linear correlation was found between log maternal blood As and log cord blood As (rho= 0. 80, p< 0. 001). Birth outcomes showed geographical differences. in gestational age (p< 0. 001), birth length (p= 0. 019), head circumference (p< 0. 001), Apgar score at 5 min (p< 0. 001) and parity (p< 0. 002). In a multivariate analysis, no association between maternal blood (AsB) levels and birth outcomes were found. However, the lower the gestational age, the higher the levels of maternal AsB (β=- 0. 054; 95 % CI- 0. 087 to - 0. 020) and mothers who had had at least one child were less likely to have higher AsB if compared to those who had never had any child (β=- 0. 177; 95 CI- 0. 322 to 0. 031). In both univariate and multivariate analyses, being single, and drinking water from communal outdoor taps, boreholes and rivers was associated with higher As levels.

40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} A (VEGFA) {{plays a role}} in both {{angiogenesis}} and seminiferous cord formation, and alternative splicing of the Vegfa gene produces both proangiogenic isoforms and antiangiogenic isoforms (B-isoforms). The objectives of this study were to evaluate the expression of pro- and antiangiogenic isoforms during testis development and to determine the role of VEGFA isoforms in testis morphogenesis. Quantitative RT-PCR determined that Vegfa_ 165 b mRNA was most abundant between embryonic days 13. 5 and 16 (E 13. 5 and 16; P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Compared with ovarian mRNA levels, Vegfa_ 120 was more abundant at E 13 – 14 (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), Vegfa_ 164 was less abundant at E 13 (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), and Vegfa_ 165 b tended to be less abundant at E 13 (P 3 ̆c 0. 09) in testes. Immunohistochemical staining localized antiangiogenic isoforms to subsets of germ cells at E 14 – 16, and western blot analysis revealed similar protein levels for VEGFA_ 165 B, VEGFA_ 189 B, and VEGFA_ 206 B at this time point. Treatment of E 13 organ culture testes with VEGFA_ 120, VEGFA_ 164, and an antibody to antiangiogenic isoforms (anti-VEGFAxxxB) resulted in less organized and defined seminiferous <b>cords</b> compared with <b>paired</b> controls. In addition, 50 ng/ml VEGFA_ 120 and VEGFA_ 164 treatments increased vascular density in cultured testes by 60 and 48...|$|R
40|$|Streptococcus agalactiae (group B {{streptococcus}} [GBS]) is {{the leading}} cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. In this study, we determined antibody-mediated deposition of complement C 3 b/iC 3 b onto the bacterial cell surface of GBS serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, and V. This was determined for 520 mother and umbilical <b>cord</b> serum sample <b>pairs</b> obtained at the time of birth from a popula-tion on the Thailand-Myanmar border. Antibody-mediated deposition of complement C 3 b/iC 3 b was detected to at least one se-rotype in 91 % of mothers, despite a known carriage rate in this population of only 12 %. Antibody-mediated C 3 b/iC 3 b deposi-tion corresponded to known carriage rates, with the highest levels of complement deposition observed onto the most prevalent serotype (serotype II) followed by serotypes Ia, III, V, and Ib. Finally, neonates born to mothers carrying serotype II GBS at the time of birth showed higher antibody-mediated C 3 b/iC 3 b deposition against serotype II GBS than neonates born to mothers with no serotype II carriage. Assessment of antibody-mediated C 3 b/iC 3 b deposition against GBSmay provide insights into the seroepidemiology of anti-GBS antibodies in mothers and infants in different populations. Group B streptococcus (GBS) (Streptococcus agalactiae) is anatural commensal of the vagina and rectum and is normally carried asymptomatically (1). However, it is also the leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in developed countries and i...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the Drosophila ventral nerve <b>cord,</b> {{the three}} <b>pairs</b> of Capability neuropeptide-expressing Va neurons are {{exclusively}} {{found in the}} second, third and fourth abdominal segments (A 2 –A 4). To address the underlying mechanisms behind such segment-specific cell specification, we followed the developmental specification of these neurons. We find that Va neurons are initially generated in all ventral nerve cord segments and progress along a common differentiation path. However, their terminal differentiation only manifests itself in A 2 –A 4, due to two distinct mechanisms: segment-specific programmed cell death (PCD) in posterior segments, and differentiation to an alternative identity in segments anterior to A 2. Genetic analyses reveal that the Hox homeotic genes {{are involved in the}} segment-specific appearance of Va neurons. In posterior segments, the Hox gene Abdominal-B exerts a pro-apoptotic role on Va neurons, which involves the function of several RHG genes. Strikingly, this role of Abd-B is completely opposite to its role in the segment-specific apoptosis of other classes of neuropeptide neurons, the dMP 2 and MP 1 neurons, where Abd-B acts in an anti-apoptotic manner. In segments A 2 –A 4 we find that abdominal A is important for the terminal differentiation of Va cell fate. In the A 1 segment, Ultrabithorax acts to specify an alternate Va neuron fate. In contrast, in thoracic segments, Antennapedia suppresses the Va cell fate. Thus, Hox genes act in a multi-faceted manner to control the segment-specific appearance of the Va neuropeptide neurons in the ventral nerve cord...|$|R
