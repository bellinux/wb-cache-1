5|$|The {{decision}} prompted {{complaints that}} Metro was inconveniencing its many customers, including tourists and other infrequent users, {{who did not}} own a SmarTrip card. In April 2007, WMATA began testing the use of <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> pay for parking at six Metro stations, avoiding the need to pay for parking with SmarTrip cards at those stations. The sites are Anacostia on the Green Line, Shady Grove on the Red Line, Vienna and New Carrollton on the Orange Line, and Franconia-Springfield and Largo Town Center on the Blue Line. One exit lane at each station accepts credit card payments through a reader next to the existing SmarTrip card target. WMATA has since {{announced that it will}} make at least one credit card exit lane available at all Metro pay-on-exit parking facilities.|$|E

In 1958, the bank introduced the BankAmericard, which {{changed its name}} to Visa in 1977. A consortium of other California banks introduced Master Charge (now MasterCard) to compete with BankAmericard.|$|E

One millionaire friend had dumped Cunanan in 1996, the prior year.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>card</b> {{fraud is}} the {{unauthorized}} {{use of a}} <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>to</b> make a transaction. This fraud can range from using the <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> <b>to</b> obtain goods without actually paying, or performing transactions that were not authorized by the <b>card</b> holder. <b>Credit</b> <b>card</b> fraud is a serious offense, and punished under the charge of identity theft. The majority {{of this type of}} fraud occurs with counterfeit <b>credit</b> <b>cards,</b> or using cards that were lost or stolen. Approximately [...]01% of all transactions are deemed fraudulent, and approximately 10% of Americans have reported some type of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> fraud in their lifetimes.|$|R
25|$|Some spammers {{argue that}} most of these costs could {{potentially}} be alleviated by having spammers reimburse ISPs and persons for their material. There are three problems with this logic: first, the rate of reimbursement they could credibly budget is not nearly high enough to pay the direct costs , second, the human cost (lost mail, lost time, and lost opportunities) is basically unrecoverable, and third, spammers often use stolen bank accounts and <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> finance their operations, and would conceivably do so to pay off any fines imposed.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to cost factors, increasingly colleges are being compared {{on the basis}} of the average student debt of their graduates, and US News has developed rankings based on average student indebtedness. A report in the Utne Reader chronicled substantial student indebtedness, and suggested that 37 million Americans in 2009 held student debt, and that nine in ten students used an average of 4.6 <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> pay for some educational expenses. The report chronicled an increase in average indebtedness from an average of $2,000 in 1980–81 to over $25,000 in 2009, as well as substantial decreases in Federal aid and Pell grants during that time period.|$|E
25|$|These {{fees are}} {{typically}} from 1 to 6 percent of each sale, but will vary {{not only from}} merchant to merchant (large merchants can negotiate lower rates), but also from card to card, with business cards and rewards cards generally costing the merchants more to process. The interchange fee that applies to a particular transaction is also affected by many other variables including: the type of merchant, the merchant's total card sales volume, the merchant's average transaction amount, whether the cards were physically present, how the information required for the transaction was received, the specific type of card, when the transaction was settled, and the authorized and settled transaction amounts. In some cases, merchants add a surcharge to the <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> cover the interchange fee, encouraging their customers to instead use cash, debit cards, or even cheques.|$|E

25|$|The {{case has}} been {{called one of the}} most {{important}} of the late 20th century, since it freed nationally chartered banks to offer <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> anyone in the U.S. they deemed qualified, and more specifically because it allowed them to export credit card interest rates to states with stricter regulations, opening up a race between states in an effort to attract lending institutions to set up shop in their states and offer a wider variety of consumer credit products. Over the next decade, the states accelerated a process that had already begun of repealing or loosening their anti-usury laws, allowing state-chartered banks to compete more equally with national ones. As a result, the use of credit cards has vastly increased, and since the mortgage industry soon followed suit, the issuance of subprime mortgages also increased drastically, facilitating the housing bubble that led to the 2008 housing crisis.|$|E
500|$|Wildflower was {{produced}} {{over the course}} of 16 years. The track [...] "Saturday Night Inside Out" [...] was originally from a mixtape in 2000 and was the first song Chater made after Since I Left You. Production for the album was not completed until March 2016. The Avalanches became more serious about building a second album around 2011–13 and booked studio time to commit themselves to the project. Until about 2014, Chater was using a Power Macintosh G3 beige with System 7 for Studio Vision, a sequencing program that ended support in 1997. The group had to max out <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> help finance production.|$|E
2500|$|Credit {{cards are}} a risky way for {{entrepreneurs}} to acquire capital for their start ups when more conventional financing is unavailable.

Similarly, filmmaker Robert Townsend financed part of Hollywood Shuffle using credit cards. Director Kevin Smith funded Clerks {{in part by}} maxing out several credit cards. Actor Richard Hatch also financed his production of [...] partly through his credit cards. Famed hedge fund manager Bruce Kovner began his career (and, later on, his firm Caxton Associates) in financial markets by borrowing from his credit card.

2500|$|The Phillies next {{series against}} the Washington Nationals began in the offseason.

[...] In prior years, Nationals Park has {{been taken over by}} Phillies fans who could not get tickets for a home game, and the crowd was at times made up of over 80% Phillies fans. The park was publicly referred to by Phillies fans as [...] "Citizens Bank Park South." [...] To avoid this, Feffer allowed only those with Maryland, Virginia, or D.C. addressed <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> <b>to</b> purchase tickets. Once the series came near, the Nationals released an official [...] "", which explained fans how to approach the series, and gave them guidelines on how to cheer for their home team. Once the series came, it was the Nationals who were in 1st place in the division, and the Phillies who were at the bottom. The first game of the series went into extra innings, with the Nationals taking game 1, 4–3. Charlie Manuel was ejected in the game in the 1st inning, it was his first ejection of the season. The Nationals also took game two of the series by a score of 7–1. However, the Phillies took the third game by a convincing 9–3 victory. In the game, former Phillie Jayson Werth broke his wrist, and while leaving the field, was heckled by a couple of Phillies fans. Following the game in an email to The Washington Post, Werth wrote [...] "I am motivated to get back quickly and see to it personally those people never walk down Broad Street in celebration again." [...] Despite an attempt to be shut out, many Phillies fans still made the trip to Washington, many of them sporting their [...] "Occupy Nationals Park" [...] T-shirts.|$|E
