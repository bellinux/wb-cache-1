50|$|There {{are three}} persons, two numbers and four moods (indicative, <b>conditional,</b> <b>imperative</b> and subjunctive) to {{consider}} in conjugation. There are six tenses in German: the present and past are conjugated, and there are four compound tenses. There are two categories of verbs in German: weak and strong. Some grammars use the term mixed verbs to refer to weak verbs with irregularities. For a historical perspective on German verbs, see Germanic weak verb and Germanic strong verb.|$|E

50|$|Nouns in Cimbrian, as in German {{and other}} German dialects, have three genders - masculine, feminine, {{as well as}} neuter. Cimbrian makes use of the nominative, dative, and accusative cases. The genitive case was {{formerly}} used but has now been replaced {{with the use of}} the dative + vo ('of'), a similar case which can also be seen in modern German. Cimbrian nouns inflect for gender, case, and number, usually keeping the same patterns for even Italian loanwords ending in -a, - o, and -e. Nouns also have forms for diminutives. Cimbrian articles (both definite and indefinite) have long and short forms depending on stress. Examples of Cimbrian noun inflection (with long articles and German counterparts) can be seen below. Note: å is equal to an open back unrounded vowel.Cimbrian verbs are inflected for person, number, tense (present, past, future), mood (indicative, subjunctive, <b>conditional,</b> <b>imperative,</b> infinitive, gerund, and participial), and voice (active, passive). In regards to conjugation, Cimbrian shares many aspects with many other upper-German dialects. As in these other dialects, the use of the preterite has been replaced by the perfect which is formed with the prefix ga- (vallen ‘to fall; gavallet 'fallen’). Infinitive verbs have two forms, a simple infinitive as well as a dependent infinitive which is formed with zo. An example of this can be seen with the verb 'to fall': vallen - zo valla. In the Cimbrian of Lusern's present indicative, 1st person plural as well as 3rd person plural are both formed in the same manner as the simple infinitive, just as in standard German. Thus vallen acts as the infinitive, 1st person plural, and 3rd person plural. The 1st and 3rd person plural also match each other in other tenses and moods.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Imperatives {{cannot be}} true or false, {{so they are}} shunned by logicians. And yet imperatives can be {{combined}} by logical connectives: “kiss me and hug me ” is the conjunction of “kiss me ” with “hug me”. This example may suggest that declarative and imperative logic are isomorphic: just as the conjunction of two declaratives is true exactly if both conjuncts are true, the conjunction of two imperatives is satisfied exactly if both conjuncts are satisfied⎯what more is there to say? Much more, I argue. “If you love me, kiss me”, a <b>conditional</b> <b>imperative,</b> mixes a declarative antecedent (“you love me”) with an imperative consequent (“kiss me”); it is satisfied if you love and kiss me, violated if you love but don’t kiss me, and avoided if you don’t love me. So we need a logic of three-valued imperatives which mixes declaratives with imperatives. I develop such a logic. 1...|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the cross-linguistically rare {{phenomenon}} of past tense imperatives and, more precisely, with the past perfect imperative in Dutch. With this construction, the speaker typically conveys the undesirability {{of a state of}} affairs that cannot be changed anymore and reprimands the addressee. The article examines the two functional accounts that have been proposed in the literature. Proeme (1984) provides a definition of the imperative that is so broad that no a priori restrictions of verb types, aspect and tense can be assumed. It is argued that his starting point is debatable from a usage-based perspective and that his account cannot explain the construction’s standard interpretation, the dubious acceptability of other interpretations and its scarcity in the world’s languages. Duinhoven (1995) regards the past perfect imperative as the outcome of the interaction of the counterfactual conditional inversion construction and the (<b>conditional)</b> <b>imperative</b> construction. His fairly idiosyncratic account is evaluated positively in the light of construction grammar and the typological literature on directive strategies and insubordination. The assumed processes of analogy and conventionalization are argued to be at odds with the construction’s infrequency in corpora, though...|$|E
40|$|Out {{of theory}} and into the fray * Abstract. The topic of mood and {{modality}} (MOD) is a difficult aspect of language description because, among other reasons, the inventory of modal meanings is not stable across languages, moods do not map neatly from one language to another, modality may be realized morphologically or by free-standing words, and modality interacts in complex ways with other modules of the grammar, like tense and aspect. Describing MOD is especially difficult if one attempts to develop a unified approach that not only provides cross-linguistic coverage but is also useful in practical natural language processing systems. This article discusses an approach to MOD that was developed for and implemented in the Boas knowledge-elicitation (KE) system. Boas elicits knowledge about any language, L, from an informant who {{need not be a}} trained linguist. That knowledge then serves as the static resources for an L-to-English translation system. The knowledge-elicitation methodology used throughout Boas is driven by a resident inventory of parameters, value sets, and means of their realization {{for a wide range of}} language phenomena. MOD is one of those parameters, whose values are the inventory of attested and not yet attested moods (e. g., indicative, <b>conditional,</b> <b>imperative),</b> and whose realizations includ...|$|E

40|$|For the {{purposes}} of this paper, <b>conditional</b> <b>imperatives</b> (henceforth CIs) are indicative conditionals whose consequent has the grammatical form of an imperative, illustrated in (1). (1) a. If you are at an intersection, turn right! b. If you reach an intersection, turn right! The main goal {{of this paper is to}} develop a unified semantic analysis of CIs, one which adequately captures their similarities to (unconditional) imperatives on the one hand and (unimperative) conditionals, on the other. Both of those latter phenomena have been explored extensively and, differences over theoretical framework and formal implementation notwithstanding, are comparatively well-understood. In tackling CIs, then, the first question to ask is whether or to what extent their semantic behavior can be captured by simply combining an analysis of imperatives with one of conditionals. We show in this paper that the answer is affirmative in principle, but that CIs also raise a number of specific challenges which in turn inform the analysis of <b>imperatives</b> and <b>conditionals</b> in general...|$|R
