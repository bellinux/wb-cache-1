The <b>coordination</b> of the berkelium atom in its trivalent fluoride and chloride is tricapped trigonal prismatic, with a <b>coordination</b> number of 9.

5|$|Actinides with {{oxidation}} state +6, {{except for the}} AnO22+-type cations, form 2−, 2− and other complex anions. For example, uranium, neptunium and plutonium form salts of the Na2UO4 (uranate) and (NH4)2U2O7 (diuranate) types. In comparison with lanthanides, actinides more easily form <b>coordination</b> compounds, and this ability increases with the actinide valence. Trivalent actinides do not form fluoride <b>coordination</b> compounds, whereas tetravalent thorium forms K2ThF6, KThF5, and even K5ThF9 complexes. Thorium also forms the corresponding sulfates (for example Na2SO4·Th (SO4)2·5H2O), nitrates and thiocyanates. Salts with the general formula An2Th(NO3)6·nH2O are of <b>coordination</b> nature, with the <b>coordination</b> number of thorium equal to 12. Even easier is to produce complex salts of pentavalent and hexavalent actinides. The most stable <b>coordination</b> compounds of actinides – tetravalent thorium and uranium – are obtained in reactions with diketones, e.g. acetylacetone.|$|E
5|$|Complexes of vanadium(II) and (III) are {{relatively}} exchange inert and reducing. Those of V(IV) and V(V) are oxidants. Vanadium ion is rather large and some complexes achieve <b>coordination</b> numbers greater than 6, {{as is the}} case in 4−. Oxovanadium(V) also forms 7 coordinate <b>coordination</b> complexes with tetradentate ligands and peroxides and these complexes are used for oxidative brominations and thioether oxidations. The <b>coordination</b> chemistry of V4+ is dominated by the vanadyl center, VO2+, which binds four other ligands strongly and one weakly (the one trans to the vanadyl center). An example is vanadyl acetylacetonate (V(O)(O2C5H7)2). In this complex, the vanadium is 5-coordinate, square pyramidal, meaning that a sixth ligand, such as pyridine, may be attached, though the association constant of this process is small. Many 5-coordinate vanadyl complexes have a trigonal bypyramidal geometry, such as VOCl2(NMe3)2. The <b>coordination</b> chemistry of V5+ is dominated by the relatively stable dioxovanadium <b>coordination</b> complexes which are often formed by aerial oxidation of the vanadium(IV) precursors indicating the stability of the +5 oxidation state and ease of interconversion between the +4 and +5 states.|$|E

40|$|The {{structural}} {{diversity of}} arsenic sulfide molecules in compositions between As 4 S 6 and As 4 was investigated using ab initio quantum chemical calculations. The As 4 S 6 molecule {{consists of four}} trigonal pyramid <b>coordinations</b> of As atoms bonding to three S atoms. In the As 4 S 5 composition, only one type of molecular configuration corresponds to an uzonite-type molecule. In the As 4 S 4 composition, two molecular configurations exist with realgar-type and pararealgar-type molecules. Three molecular configurations are in the As 4 S 3 composition. The first configuration comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom <b>coordinations</b> of two types: bonding to two S atoms and one As atom, and bonding to one S atom and two As atoms. The second is the molecular configuration of dimorphite. The third comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom <b>coordinations</b> of two types: bonding to three As atoms, and bonding to one As atom and two S atoms. The As 4 S 2 composition allows molecular configurations of two types. One is comprised of trigonal pyramidal As atom configurations of one type bonding to two As atoms and one S atom. The other comprises trigonal pyramidal As atom <b>coordinations</b> of three types: bonding to two S atoms and one As atoms, bonding to one S atom and two As atoms, and bonding to three As atoms.
