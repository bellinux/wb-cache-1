Powder diffraction data are usually presented as a diffractogram in which the diffracted intensity, I, is shown as a function either of the scattering angle 2θ or {{as a function of the}} scattering vector length q. The latter variable has the advantage that the diffractogram no longer depends on the value of the wavelength λ. The advent of synchrotron sources has widened the choice of wavelength considerably. To facilitate <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> obtained with different wavelengths the use of q is therefore recommended and gaining acceptability.|$|E
50|$|The {{scheme was}} {{established}} in 1974 by the Department of the Environment {{with much of the}} initial planning and implementation undertaken by the Water Research Centre. It involved the creation of a network of sites across the UK. Most sites were at the downstream freshwater limits of the larger rivers although some of the largest rivers also included additional locations below major tributary confluences. Before inclusion of any location in the survey, homogeneity testing was carried out to characterise quality variations laterally and vertically within the river section chosen. For each designated point a specific sampling location was identified {{based on the results of}} the homogeneity exercise. In addition laboratories who were to undertake the analysis of samples were identified and a comprehensive AQC exercise was conducted to ensure <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> derived from the monitoring programme.|$|E

5000|$|One of the {{fundamental}} elements of biomedical and translational research {{is the use of}} integrated data repositories. Survey conducted in 2010, defined [...] "integrated data repository" [...] (IDR) as a data warehouse incorporating various sources of clinical data to support queries for a range of research-like functions. Integrated data repositories are complex systems developed to solve a variety of problems ranging from identity management, protection of confidentiality, semantic and syntactic <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> from different sources, and most importantly convenient and flexible query. Development of the field of clinical informatics lead to the creation of large data sets with electronic health record data integrated with other data (such as genomic data). Types of data repositories include operational data stores (ODSs), clinical data warehouses, clinical data marts, and clinical registries. Operational data stores established for extracting, transferring and loading before creating warehouse or data marts. Clinical registries repositories have long been in existence, but their contents are disease specific and sometimes considered archaic. Clinical data stores and clinical data warehouses are considered fast and reliable. Though these large integrated repositories have impacted clinical research significantly, it still faces challenges and barriers. One big problem is the requirement for ethical approval by the institutional review board (IRB) for each research analysis meant for publication. Some research resources do not require individual IRB approval, example CDWs with data of deceased patients have been de-identified, and its usage does not require institutional review board (IRB) approval. However, privacy sensitive data may still be explored by researchers when shared through its metadata and services, for example by following a linked open data perspective. Another challenge is data quality. Methods that adjust for bias (such as using propensity score matching methods) assume that complete health record is captured. Tools that examine data quality (e.g., point to missing data) help in discovering data quality problems.|$|E

The paper begins with a broad literature review on different frameworks for classifying types of error encountered in surveys.

From the side <b>of</b> EU-SILC <b>data</b> use and analysis it is helpful to identify and classify patterns of distortion to which particular results are subject.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine whether existing data sources from household interview based surveys conducted in a large number of countries may be used towards estimating the distribution and levels of severity of non-fatal health at the population level. Operationally, this objective addresses two main questions: 1. Is there information content on the severity and distribution of non-fatal health status in data collected through household interview surveys? 2. May this information be compared in a valid and reliable manner across countries? The paper first reviews current approaches to measure health status within interview based surveys and the limitations of these approaches concerning the cross-population <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> collected, not only the comparability of questions. Issues demanding further attention concerning the cross-population comparability include inconsistent reporting and differences in end-points and cut-points on reference scales. These limitations prevent the meaningful comparison of survey data within and across populations. The paper then describes and tests a methodology to extract information on non-fatal health status. This approach is specific to self-reported data from different surveys conducted in different populations, as a first attempt to improve <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> given that no external means to calibrate responses are available.
