Kit cars supplied as bare <b>chassis</b> <b>without</b> <b>bodywork</b> and with unguarded wheels do not meet EU safety criteria for registration.|$|E
5000|$|The Ford E-Series (also {{known as}} the Ford Econoline and Ford Club Wagon {{throughout}} various stages of its production) is a range of full-size vans produced by Ford Motor Company. Introduced for the 1961 model year as the replacement for the Ford F-Series panel van, four generations of the model line have been produced. In addition to cargo van and passenger van body styles, the Ford E-Series has been produced as a cutaway van chassis and stripped chassis (a <b>chassis</b> <b>without</b> <b>bodywork).</b>|$|E

50|$|This initial {{prototype}} first ran at Silverstone in 1968 <b>without</b> <b>bodywork.</b> The drivetrain {{for the car}} was a 3-litre Martin V8 driving through a Triumph TR4 gearbox with overdrive. The car weighed 1070 kg. Overall performance was good but the testing uncovered problems with the engine and its lack of road-car ancillaries.|$|R
50|$|A {{rolling chassis}} is the chassis {{of a car}} or truck, {{assembled}} together with the engine and drivetrain, but <b>without</b> <b>bodywork.</b> Such rolling <b>chassis</b> were built by car makers, for supply to coachbuilders who would later build the bodywork. Although common {{in the early days}} of motoring, such rolling chassis are now rare. A few custom markets, such as limousines, may still use them.|$|R
50|$|The Wright Pulsar Gemini HEV is {{a hybrid}} {{double-decker}} bus built by Wrightbus. It {{is also the}} first hybrid double-decker in the UK.

50|$|A Formula Ford car {{is one of}} {{the more}} distinctive-looking open-wheel race cars because it does not have wings to create {{aerodynamic}} downforce. In order to reduce cost and allow smaller manufacturers to produce their own design of <b>chassis</b> <b>without</b> prohibitive tooling costs, chassis are steel space frame, unlike the monocoques found in other types of single seater racing.|$|R
50|$|Other {{accessories}} {{supplied with}} the rifle include a lightweight soft case for transporting the APR {{to the shooting}} range, a triple rail interface which fits to the weapon's <b>chassis</b> <b>without</b> any modification and provides three additional Picatinny rails {{that can be used}} to mount night vision equipment other than Simrad, laser aiming/designation devices or illumination tools.|$|R
50|$|On {{completion}} of the first test, the engine {{was removed from the}} bench and fitted under observation to the <b>chassis</b> <b>without</b> any vital parts being disturbed. A standard type four-seater body was fitted and the car proceeded from Coventry to Weybridge - 112 miles (180.2 km). The average weight of the car and passengers on the road was 4,085 lbs = 1 ton 16 cwt 1 qr 25 lbs (1852.9 kg).|$|R
50|$|Although {{the teams}} are not as {{limitless}} in their modifications or powerplants, the series continues to run today, mostly with various open-wheel cars <b>without</b> full <b>bodywork</b> that became obsolete in current championship series, mainly Formula 3.|$|R
50|$|Svenska Automobilfabriken (SAF) was a Swedish car {{manufacturer}} founded in Bollnäs in December 1919. It assembled US cars based on Pullman Motor Co chassis bought when Pullman went bankrupt in 1917, and fitted them with coachworks and adapted them for Swedish conditions. The engine was a Golden, Belknapp & Swartz giving 32 hp. It was {{fitted with a}} Stromberg carburettor and had a 50-litre gasoline tank. People who earlier had worked on Rengsjöbilen were among the employees. SAF bought 40 Pullman chassis, and built 28 SAF cars before the company went bankrupt in 1921. The remaining stock (with or <b>without</b> <b>bodywork)</b> was sold out over a few years.|$|R
50|$|The Toyota Camatte57s Sport LED was {{unveiled}} at the June 2014 Tokyo Toy Show as an updated {{body for the}} 2014 Toyota Camatte57s Sport electric chassis.

50|$|There was {{a choice}} of either a single-speed or {{two-speed}} rear axle, both of spiral-bevel form and derived from the Comet 90 design, the latter using an electrically actuated Eaton driving head in a Leyland casing. Wheels were of the eight-stud type and diaphragm-type air braking was standard. This {{was the first time}} Leyland had offered a bus <b>chassis</b> <b>without</b> another braking option, whilst vacuum or vacuum-hydraulic brakes were still standard across most of the UK bus and coach industry.|$|R
5000|$|The 1970 {{redesign}} of the Sonett V4, named the Sonett III, was initially undertaken by Sergio Coggiola, but Gunnar A.

50|$|MadeInGermany is a Volkswagen Passat Variant 3C with a {{built-in}} drive-by-wire control. It measures 4.7 m in length, 1.8 m in width, and 1.5 m in height with a total weight of 1.7 tons. Furthermore, it {{is equipped with a}} 2.0 liter Turbocharged Stratified Injection (TSI) engine. Parts of the CAN gateway interfaces have been opened by Volkswagen for research purposes so that a computer can access and control the car. In addition, various lidar and radar scanners are integrated into the vehicle’s <b>chassis</b> <b>without</b> exceeding the ex factory measurements of the vehicle (except for the Velodyne sensor).|$|R
50|$|Hispakart started {{constructing}} racing cars in 1965. After seeing Tecno Formula 4 cars Lopez {{decided to}} start constructing cars for the Spanish championship. Jorge de Bagration imported a Tecno K250 {{and showed it to}} Lopez. Lopez copied the design and <b>chassis</b> <b>without</b> a licence to do so. Hispakart built 26 chassis. Prince Luitpold of Bavaria was one of the drivers. Hispakart had become one of the largest Formula 4 constructors in Spain. In 1968 Hispakart built the GT. Influenced by the Artes Campeador, built by Selex, the car was unveiled at the 1967 Barcelona Motor Show. The car had a tubular steel chassis and a fiberglass bodywork. The bodywork was built but the car was never completed.|$|R
50|$|Volvo B54 was a front-engined midibus chassis {{manufactured}} by Volvo between 1966 and 1971. It was technically {{more or less}} just a Volvo F85 truck <b>chassis</b> <b>without</b> the cab. The engine was mounted {{on top of the}} front axle, giving the buses very little front overhang. Before the end of production in 1971, it was in a way replaced by the larger BB57, but the true successor was the F6-based B609 that came in 1976, half a decade later. The B54's predecessor had gone out of production in 1964, so it was clearly not a model that Volvo put a lot of effort into at the time. Only 533 chassis were built.|$|R

50|$|Volvo B609, Volvo B6F and Volvo B6FA were {{a series}} of front-engined midibus chassises {{manufactured}} by Volvo between 1976 and 1987. Its predecessor, the B54 was not a success, while the interim replacement, the BB57 was too large, so in 1976 Volvo launched the B609, which {{was in many ways}} just a Volvo F6 truck <b>chassis</b> <b>without</b> the cab, which meant it had the engine mounted on top of the front axle. In 1978 it was replaced by the B6F, which was built in the same way, but a bit more adapted to bus needs. Volvo also introduced the B6FA, which was a more conventional front-engined chassis, and a bit larger too. While the B6F had max gross weight of 9.3 tonnes the B6FA would manage 12 tonnes. While production of the smaller B6F ended in 1982, the B6FA lasted until 1987.|$|R
5000|$|For its 1991 production, Wayne Corporation {{was forced}} to update the Lifestar; the supply of S7 chassis had run out and Caterpillar was discontinuing the 3208 engine in the United States, leaving the Asia-Smith <b>chassis</b> <b>without</b> an engine. In addition, the {{introduction}} of the Blue Bird TC/2000 and the Thomas Saf-T-Liner MVP series introduced new competition for the Lifestar. To adapt, Wayne replaced the S7 chassis with the International 3900FC, introduced in 1990. Although Wayne would have to share the 3900 with Ward, Carpenter, and Canadian bus manufacturer EMC/Corbeil, it was a reliable source of chassis production. The new chassis required modifications to the Lifestar's bodywork; the most visible changes were a 4-piece wrap-around windshield, quad headlights, and a change in the placement of the entry door. The powetrain included an International DT360 or DT466 inline-6 diesel with an Allison automatic transmission.|$|R
50|$|Each {{participant}} in the Formula Lightning series purchased an identical rolling chassis, then designed and built the electric drive system for their vehicle. There were no changes allowed in the <b>chassis</b> design <b>without</b> majority approval of the Formula Lightning Owners Association.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{optimized}} multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) {{antenna system}} is proposed. It {{is based on}} the traditional planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) design, accommodated on a printed circuit board (PCB) for mobile handsets and operating at 2 1. 6 GHz. The PIFA dimension is reduced by 30 % with meander structure etched on the conventional PIFA. Diversity performances of a parallel dual-element Meander PIFA array are evaluated in different statistical propagation environments for both <b>without</b> <b>chassis</b> and with chassis configurations. It is found that an optimized Meander PIFA with chassis can still keep nearly the same good diversity performance as the case <b>without</b> <b>chassis.</b> It has also been shown that the dual-element Meander PIFA can work well in different statistical environments...|$|R
40|$|This work {{serves as}} a {{proof-of-concept}} for bacterially derived SimCells (Simple Cells), which contain the cell machinery from bacteria and designed DNA (or potentially a simplified genome) to instruct the cell to carry out novel, specific tasks. SimCells represent a reprogrammable <b>chassis</b> <b>without</b> a native chromosome, which can host designed DNA to perform defined functions. In this paper, the use of Escherichia coli MC 1000 ∆minD minicells as a non-reproducing chassis for SimCells was explored, as demonstrated by their ability to act as sensitive biosensors for small molecules. Highly purified minicells derived from E. coli strains containing gene circuits for biosensing were able to transduce the input signals from several small molecules (glucarate, acrylate and arabinose) into the production of green fluorescent protein (GFP). A mathematical model was developed to fit the experimental data for induction of gene expression in SimCells. The intracellular ATP level was shown to be important for SimCell function. A purification and storage protocol was developed to prepare SimCells which could remain their functions {{for an extended period}} of time. This study demonstrates that SimCells are able to perform as ‘smart bioparticles’ controlled by designed gene circuits...|$|R
