Study focusMost estimates of evaporation from water bodies located in semi-arid environments suffer {{from the lack of}} data, or biased field measurements. It is thus important for hydrologists to assess the relative performance of the various available methods used to estimate this water loss, as well as their uncertainties. We confronted physical approaches based on contrasted theoretical formulae (Dalton, simplified BREB, Penman) and geochemical approaches based on mass conservation (stable isotopes and chloride). We compared the results with <b>Colorado</b> <b>pan</b> measurements, and tested the methods’ sensitivity to various physical parameters and data gaps. New hydrological insights for the regionIn this region, where mean annual rainfall is 300 mm, estimates of evaporation of the El Haouareb Dam lake ranged from 1400 to 1900 mma− 1, depending on the method and the year. The Penman approach was found to be the most robust and gave an annual mean of 1600 mma− 1. Evaporation values were refined by combining results from the different methods. Mean interannual evaporation was estimated to be 1700 mma− 1, with an uncertainty of 15 %. From this work, we propose an annual <b>Colorado</b> <b>pan</b> conversion coefficient of 0. 8 which can be adjusted, 1. 0 for spring and 0. 76 {{for the rest of the}} year...|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: The pan {{evaporation}} coefficient (Kp) is used {{to convert}} pan Evaporation (Ep) to reference Evapotranspiration (ETo) due to its simplicity and suitability for locations with limited availability of meteorological data. Approach: This study presents the use of neuro-genetic approach for estimating Kp for Class A <b>pan</b> and <b>Colorado</b> Sunken <b>pan</b> under green and dry fetch conditions. Results: Representative values were used to represent the category data, i. e., wind run and relative humidity. It {{was found that the}} genetic algorithm helped automatically search for the optimal structure of the back-propagation network, replacing the very tedious trial and error approach. Conclusion: A comparative analysis showed that the neural-genetic approach fairly outperformed previous proposed Kp equations for both green and dry fetch conditions...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Pan Evaporation has {{extensively}} {{been used}} for estimating reference Evapotranspiration (ETo) due to its simplicity, low cost, ease of data interpretation and application and suitability for locations with limited availability of meteorological data. With this method, the pan coefficient (Kp) {{is a key element}} to be determined as well as the pan Evaporation (Ep) data. Approach: This study presents the development of new pan coefficient (Kp) equations for Class A <b>pan</b> and <b>Colorado</b> sunken <b>pan</b> under green and dry fetch conditions by using M 5 model tree based on soft computing technique. The Kp values were taken from FAO- 24 Kp table for the development of Kp equations. Results: The results of the study indicate the usefulness and applicability of the M 5 model tree in developing Kp equations. Those proposed equations based on the M 5 model tree gave better performance in estimating Kp values than the previous Kp equations as well as the new Kp equations developed by indicator regression technique. Conclusion: M 5 model tree gave more accuracy in estimating Kp values. The new proposed Kp equations can be reliably used...|$|R
