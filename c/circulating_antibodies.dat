5|$|The first {{screening}} test in someone {{suspected of having}} HIT is aimed at detecting antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes. This may be with a laboratory test of the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) type. The ELISA test, however, detects all <b>circulating</b> <b>antibodies</b> that bind heparin-PF4 complexes, and may also falsely identify antibodies that do not cause HIT. Therefore, those with a positive ELISA are tested further with a functional assay. This test uses platelets and serum from the patient; the platelets are washed and mixed with serum and heparin. The sample is then tested {{for the release of}} serotonin, a marker of platelet activation. If this serotonin release assay (SRA) shows high serotonin release, the diagnosis of HIT is confirmed. The SRA test is difficult to perform and is usually only done in regional laboratories.|$|E
5|$|At the {{prenatal}} and neonatal {{stages of}} life, {{the presence of}} antibodies is provided by passive immunization from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within {{the first years of}} life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said {{to be part of the}} humoral immune system. <b>Circulating</b> <b>antibodies</b> are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one antigen (an example is a virus capsid protein fragment). Antibodies contribute to immunity in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway. Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).|$|E
25|$|Myasthenia gravis is a {{neuromuscular disease}} leading to {{fluctuating}} muscle weakness and fatigability during simple activities. Weakness is typically caused by <b>circulating</b> <b>antibodies</b> that block acetylcholine receptors at the post-synaptic neuromuscular junction, inhibiting the stimulative {{effect of the}} neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Myasthenia is treated with immunosuppressants, cholinesterase inhibitors and, in selected cases, thymectomy.|$|E
40|$|Injection {{of foreign}} protein into a guinea pig may induce delayed hypersensitivity, {{followed}} by <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> and Arthus-type hypersensitivity (1, 2). If the antigenic dose is sufficiently minute, delayed hypersensitivity is not {{followed by the}} appearance of detectable amounts of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> (3). If a guinea pig with delayed hypersensitivity is, however, again stimulated with the specific homologous antigen, an anamnestic response appears, wherein <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> and Arthus-type hypersensitivity develop. The suggestion has been made that delayed hypersensitivity {{is a step in the}} formation of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> (2). The question then arises whether delayed hypersensitivity has a more primitive type of specificity than Arthus reactions and <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody.</b> The present paper describes experiments which indicate that the specificity governing delayed hypersensitivity is different from that governing <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody.</b> The delayed response, as illustrated by experiments with protein conjugates and avian albumins as antigens, is produced in response to a broad general area of the antigen molecule, whereas the reactions of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> are controlled by small, specific groupings of the antigen. These studies also indicate that delayed hypersensitivity is an intermediate stage in the formation of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody...</b>|$|R
40|$|Intracutaneous {{administration}} {{of a small}} quantity of soluble antigen into guinea pigs produces a characteristic delayed hypersensitivity, which is ultimately followed {{by the appearance of}} <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> and Arthus type hypersensitivity (1, 2). Guinea pigs sensitized intracutaneously with 1 Lf purified diphtheria toxoid in Freund adjuvant (without mycobacteria) developed delayed hypersensitivity detectable from the 4 th to 5 th day after sensitization to the llth or 12 th day; after the 12 th day Arthus reactions could be induced and <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> detected (2). This sequence of events suggests that delayed hypersensitivity {{is a step in the}} formation of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody.</b> Delayed hypersensitivity following {{administration of}} this purified soluble antigen is characteristic in that <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> cannot be detected (< 0. 0024 #g. antibody nitrogen) and hypersensitivity can be transferred to normal guinea pigs with leucocytes from sensitized donors. Cellular infiltration into the skin test site is typically mononudear (3), in contrast to the polymorphonudear invasion in the Arthus phase...|$|R
40|$|Six {{different}} proteins varying {{widely in}} molecular weight, ribonuclease, lysostaphin, ovalbumin, penicillinase, collagenase, and Varidase were tested {{for their ability}} to induce <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> formation in rabbits after repeated topical application of the proteins in a water-soluble gel vehicle. After a 12 -week exposure period, significant hemagglutinin titers were noted in rabbits treated with ovalbumin, lysostaphin, or ribonuclease; markedly elevated, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis-reacting sera were obtained only from collagenase- or lysostaphin-treated animals. Precipitin antibodies as evidenced by gel diffusion were also found in sera from collagenas- and lysostaphin-treated animals. Topical application of penicillinase was only marginally effective and Varidase was totally ineffective in elicting a positive <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> response. In all cases, topical application of proteins for periods in excess of 3 weeks was required for induction of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> formation...|$|R
25|$|Using a {{mouse model}} of bladder cancer, {{researchers}} have found that a local injection of a low dose anti-CTLA-4 in the tumour area had the same tumour inhibiting capacity as when the antibody was delivered in the blood.

25|$|If the {{myasthenia}} {{is serious}} (myasthenic crisis), plasmapheresis {{can be used}} to remove the putative antibodies from the circulation.

40|$|The {{induction}} of delayed type of hypersensitivity to {{diphtheria toxoid}} in the guinea pig was not inhibited by {{total body irradiation}} up to 300 r in intensity. X-ray doses of 200 to 300 r administered about 18 hours before sensitization caused the period of delayed hypersensitivity to be extended to the 19 th to 21 st day postsensitization in. the absence of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody.</b> X-ray doses of 50 to 100 r caused {{a decrease in the}} titer of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody,</b> although delayed hypersensitivity lasted for a normal time. When 300 r irradiation was administered 18 hours after sensitization, delayed hypersensitivity lasted for the usual period and <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> first appeared at the usual 13 to 14 days after sensitization. Introduction of normal serum or leucocytes into irradiated animals apparently did not reduce damage to the mechanism regulating the rate of antibody synthesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{concurrent}} {{administration of}} compound E at a daily dosage of 2 mg. per kg. to rabbits receiving daily intracutaneous injections of crystalline egg albumin markedly inhibited {{the development of}} anaphylactic hypersensitivity of the Arthus type. ACTH, when given at a similar dosage, produced a much less marked effect. Both hormones suppressed <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> and as with the Arthus reaction, the suppression produced by compound E was much greater than that obtained with ACTH. When treatment with compound E was started following sensitization, there was a rapid decline in <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> and, if the pretreatment serum antibody was low, {{there was also a}} progressive decrease in skin reactivity, becoming negative after 5 days of treatment. When the pretreatment serum antibody concentration was great, so that by the termination of treatment the antibody concentration was still above the level ordinarily sufficient for a maximal skin response, the Arthus reaction was unaffected by treatment. These considerations as well as the failure of compound E to inhibit the systemic passive Arthus reaction suggest that the inhibitory effect of compound E and ACTH on the development of experimental hypersensitivity results from the hormonal reduction of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody.</b> Treatment with compound E had no effect on the rate of disappearance of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> in the passively immunized rabbit. This finding suggests that ACTH and compound E reduce <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> by inhibiting antibody formation rather than by promoting antibody destruction. The question is raised as to whether the marked lymphoid atrophy produced by these hormones {{may be related to the}} interference with antibody production...|$|R

40|$|Conjugates of {{horseradish}} peroxidase with myelin basic protein (BP) of guinea pig or Lewis rat {{were used to}} identify antibody-containing cells in draining lymph nodes during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Peroxidase activity was revealed for light and electron microscopic preparations with the diaminobenzidine reaction of Graham and Karnovsky. Basic proteins (BP) were also iodinated with 125 I for determination of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> against BP by radio-immunoassay of 125 I BP using coprecipitation with antirat IgG or with antirat serum proteins. Encephalitogenicity was lost after conjugation of guinea pig BP or Lewis rat BP with peroxidase, whereas iodination {{did not affect the}} encephalitogenicity of guinea pig or Lewis rat BPs. EAE was induced in Lewis rats with guinea pig or Lewis rat spinal cord BPs in complete Freund's adjuvant. Draining lymph nodes were studied by light and electron microscopy {{during the course of the}} immune reaction, and cells with specific antibody against BP were identified with the use of BP-{{horseradish peroxidase}} conjugates. Lymph node sections from animals immunized with high antigen doses (500 μg) showed numerous plasma cells with intracellular antibody against BP in medullary cords 10 days after immunization and 4 days prior to histologic appearance of EAE. Numbers of positive cells correlated with levels of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> against BP. Immunization with a low antigen dose (5 μg) resulted in EAE, few or no antibody-containing cells, and significantly lower levels of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody.</b> Brown Norwegian rats, a strain resistant to EAE, immunized with 500 μg of BP had positive cells in draining lymph nodes and high levels of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> against BP in the absence of histologic evidence of EAE. Lewis rats injected with Lewis rat small BP failed to develop EAE. Nevertheless, these animals showed levels of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> and antibody-containing cells similar to those of animals which developed EAE after injection of the mixture of Lewis rat large and small BP. It is concluded that although the BP-peroxidase labeling method reveals cells with specific anti-BP antibody, these cells are probably unrelated to EAE. The lack of correlation between EAE induced by low antigen doses and levels of <b>circulating</b> anti-BP <b>antibody</b> (determined with the use of highly encephalitogenic 125 I-BP) suggests that effector cells can be stimulated at low antigen doses, but higher antigen doses are required to induce the production of levels of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> detectable by the method of immune coprecipitation...|$|R
40|$|Injection of rabbits with arsanil-sulfanil-thyroglobulin without {{adjuvant}} {{resulted in}} the production of hemagglutinating and precipitating antibody to native thyroglobulin and thyroiditis. Following a latent period of 1 month, these same rabbits responded to an injection of native thyroglobulin with an increase in both <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> to native thyroglobulin and severity and frequency of thyroid lesions. Some rabbits initially immunized with arsanil-sulfanil-thyroglobulin also responded to a second and third monthly injection of native thyroglobulin, but the response to the third injection was usually not as good as the response to the first injection. A few of the rabbits showed a transient production of 19 S antibody after the injection of native thyroglobulin was initiated. Neither <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> nor thyroiditis were ever observed in rabbits injected with only native thyroglobulin without adjuvant. The correlation of the thyroiditis with {{the presence or absence of}} <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> was discussed.

40|$|Periodic {{injections}} of aqueous preparations of thyroglobulin coupled to the diazonium derivatives of arsanilic and sulphanilic acids (arsanil–sulphanil thyroglobulin) resulted in perpetuation {{of both the}} synthesis of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> to native thyroglobulin and thyroiditis. Two months after the last injection, the rabbits made a strong immune response to a subsequent injection of native thyroglobulin. Without the periodic injections both <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> and thyroid lesions disappeared {{and the ability to}} respond to native thyroglobulin was lost. The level of <b>circulating</b> <b>antibody</b> and the incidence and severity of lesions were considerably greater in rabbits receiving periodic injections over a 6 -month period of time than in rabbits given a series of injections during a period of 1 month. The relation of these findings to the progressive nature of some autoimmune diseases is discussed. Complex-induced renal injury, secondary to the immune response to arsanil–sulphanil thyroglobulin, was observed in the rabbits given the periodic injections over a 6 -month period of time. Chronic glomerulonephritis apparently resulted from deposition of thyroglobulin–anti-thyroglobulin complexes and complement along the glomerular basement membranes...|$|R

However, subsequent foals that are by the same stallion or a different stallion that carries the same incompatible blood group, are at risk, and as such this disease is most commonly seen in foals out of multiparous mares. Additionally, exposure can occur due to placental abnormalities in early gestation that allow the foal's red blood cells to leak into the mare's circulation, or if the mare is exposed through blood transfusion.
