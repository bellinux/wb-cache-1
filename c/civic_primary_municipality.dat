40|$|The {{definition}} of an expectation gap is, when the local municipal politician and the audited apprehensions and expectations gets apart about what auditors {{are going to work}} with and {{what they are going to}} accomplish. Svenska Kommunförbundet writes in their publication Fullmäktige och revisionen (2004) that the communication between the auditors and the audited is important so the final result becomes great. Apart from the communication, the recurring information about auditing is important to increase the knowledge and understanding. Are there expectations on what the auditors are going to review and discover among the audited, when there probably are expectations from the inhabitants on the auditing. This leads us to our purpose of our essay which is to investigate and describe if there exist an expectation gap between the auditors and the social welfare boards in the <b>primary</b> <b>municipality.</b> The method we used to collect our data was a guided telephone interview with 66 persons. The persons were the chairperson among the auditors and the social welfare boards. After analysing our data we found out that we can’t exactly say that there is an expectation gap but there are some signs...|$|R

40|$|After World War II a rapid {{expansion}} of the Swedish health care took place. The expansion was realised chiefly as a development of the hospitals and was both produced and financed mainly within the public sector. The financing consisted to {{a high degree of}} government grants from the state to the county councils. During the period for this examination (1945 - 1955) the public responsibility for the health care was expanded. This was expressed in the publicly financed system for health insurance and the cut down in the charges that the patients had to pay for the hospital care. These changes led to some discussions on the national level but reforms could on the whole, with exception for the suggested reform of the open health care, be implemented. This case-study performed on the county council in Värmland shows that the degree of consensus was enhanced on the regional level. The county council had by tradition a culture of collusion assembling to the culture in the <b>primary</b> <b>municipalities,</b> and county council was also dominated by the strong förvaltningsutskottet (the leading executive committee). This committee functioned as a coalition government and had earned a high legitimacy which enabled the committee to implement very comprehensive reforms in the health care of Värmland...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to Japan’s current regional disparity, much {{attention has been}} given to the possibility of revitalizing her peripheral regions through in-migration of retirement-age people. Although population geographers have not viewed such internal migration that is common in Japan, it merits careful scrutiny in the current context of the country’s population trends. This article identifies such migration by analyzing the net-migration rate of people aged 60 ? 64 years by prefecture/municipality and their migration schedules during the period 2005 ? 2010. This work’s findings can be summarized as follows. Extensive human flows of the above age class were confirmed from Japan’s three largest metropolitan areas（Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya）to peripheral prefectures, almost all of which have positive netmigration rates. The spatial pattern of these rates suggests that while retirement migration to eastern Japan involves only U-turns（return migration to hometowns）, such migration to western Japan generally consists of both U-turns and I-turns （migration unrelated to hometowns）. The examination reported here at the municipal level clarified <b>primary</b> <b>municipalities</b> as destinations in three parts: Hokkaido, the Kanto and Chubu regions, and the Kinki region along with those regions farther west. Especially noteworthy is that the municipalities located in the third part are largely rural/mountain areas and islands to which retirees are attracted by favorable conditions, including amenity-rich environments. The current findings convincingly suggest that internal retirement migration does in fact exist, {{plays an important role in}} den’en-kaiki（migration to the countryside）, and mitigates the problem of mono-polar concentration in Tokyo...|$|R
