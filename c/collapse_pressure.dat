However, bedding planes and micro-cracks {{are rich in}} shale formation. When water-based drilling fluid contacts formation rock, it causes the propagation of crack and invasion of drilling fluid, which decrease shale strength and cause wellbore instability. In this paper, we analyzed influence of water-based drilling fluid on shale strength and failure mode by mechanics experiment. Based on those experimental results, considering the effect of bedding plane and drilling time, we established modeling of wellbore stability for shale formation. The result from this model indicates that in certain azimuth of horizontal well, <b>collapsing</b> <b>pressure</b> increases dramatically due to shale failure along with bedding plane. In drilling operation, those azimuths {{are supposed to be}} avoided. This model is applicable for predication of <b>collapsing</b> <b>pressure</b> in shale formation and offers reference for choosing suitable mud weight...|$|R

A total of twenty-three fiber glass reinforced plastic cylinders with thickness to diameter ratios ranging from 0. 05 to 0. 09 was tested to determine <b>collapse</b> <b>pressures</b> and the effective modulus of elasticity of the material. The length to diameter ratio was kept con-stant. Results were plotted non-dimensionally with P/E as the ordinate and h/D as the abscissa. The results were compared with available theoretical instability formulas and were in very good agreement with theory for ratios of h/D up to about 0. 07. Above this value of h/D, experimental <b>collapse</b> <b>pressures</b> were lower than those predicted by theory.

40|$|Accurate {{wellbore}} <b>collapse</b> initiation <b>pressure</b> {{is necessary}} for a robust wellbore bridging study. When drilling overbalance through a porous and permeable formation, there is flow of wellbore fluid into the formation, leaving behind a solid mud cake on the formation. Formation strengthening by drilling fluids has been discussed extensively in the literature. This work attempts to study the coupled effect of mud cake and temperature on the <b>collapse</b> initiation <b>pressure.</b> Sensitivity analysis using unequal horizontal stresses showed {{that the effect of}} mud cake on <b>collapse</b> initiation <b>pressure</b> is not affected by the mud cake compressibility but depends on mud cake thickness, rock unconfined compressive strength, stress level/magnitude and wellbore size. The presence of a mud cake reduces the <b>collapse</b> initiation <b>pressure,</b> making the formation more resistant to collapse. This effect increases as the mud cake thickness, unconfined compressive strength and stress level increase. A decrease in wellbore size also increases the effect of filter cake on <b>collapse</b> initiation <b>pressure.</b> Generally, wellbore heating weakens the formation while cooling strengthens the formation. The presence of a mud cake acts similarly to cooling the wellbore.

The main skeleton is the same both in Ch and ChA, whereas the polar head group is alcohol in Ch and ester in ChA. The 8 CB molecule has a polar cyano as a terminal group and we probe its interaction with the polar group of Ch or ChA molecules in the mixed monolayers. Both Ch- 8 CB and ChA- 8 CB mixed monolayers exhibit two collapse pressures. In {{the case of the}} Ch- 8 CB mixed monolayer, the lower <b>collapse</b> <b>pressure</b> varies after 0. 6 mole fraction (MF) of Ch in 8 CB and the higher <b>collapse</b> <b>pressure</b> is nearly independent of composition.

The mixed mo-nolayer behaviors of the 6 -O-sulfated CD amphiphiles (SO 3 -CDC 16) {{in the presence of}} dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and cholesterol were discussed using the surface pressure-molecular area (π-A) isotherms.

40|$|AbstractSince {{collapse}} of horizontal wellbore through long brittle shale interval {{is a major}} problem, the occurrence characteristics of weak planes were analyzed according to outcrop, core, and SEM and FMI data of shale rocks. A strength analysis method was developed for shale rocks with multiple weak planes based on weak-plane strength theory. An analysis was also conducted of the strength characteristics of shale rocks with uniform distribution of multiple weak planes. A <b>collapse</b> <b>pressure</b> prediction model for horizontal wells in shale formation with multiple weak planes was established, which takes into consideration the occurrence of each weak plane, wellbore stress condition, borehole azimuth, and in-situ stress azimuth. Finally, {{a case study of}} a horizontal shale gas well in southern Sichuan Basin was conducted. The results show that the intersection angle between the shale bedding plane and the structural fracture is generally large (nearly orthogonal); with the increase of weak plane number, the strength of rock mass declines sharply and is more heavily influenced by weak planes; when there are more than four weak planes, the rock strength tends to be isotropic and the whole strength of rock mass is greatly weakened, significantly increasing the risk of wellbore collapse. With the increase of weak plane number, the drilling fluid density (<b>collapse</b> <b>pressure)</b> to keep borehole stability goes up gradually. For instance, the <b>collapse</b> <b>pressure</b> is 1. 04  g/cm 3 when there are no weak planes, and 1. 55  g/cm 3 when there is one weak plane, and 1. 84  g/cm 3 when there are two weak planes. The <b>collapse</b> <b>pressure</b> prediction model for horizontal wells proposed in this paper presented results in better agreement with those in actual situation. This model, more accurate and practical than traditional models, can effectively improve the accuracy of wellbore <b>collapse</b> <b>pressure</b> prediction of horizontal shale gas wells...|$|E

40|$|The <b>collapse</b> <b>pressure</b> of an {{inflatable}} membrane is the {{minimum differential pressure}} which will sustain a specific desired shape under an applied load. In this paper, we present a method for estimating the <b>collapse</b> <b>pressure</b> of a tension-cone inflatable aerodynamic decelerator (IAD) that is subject to a static aerodynamic load. The IAD surface is modeled as an elastic membrane. For a given aerodynamic load and sufficiently high torus differential pressure, the IAD assumes a stable axisymmetric equilibrium shape. When the torus pressure is reduced sufficiently, the symmetric equilibrium state becomes unstable and we define this instance to be the critical pressure Pcr.

One of the difficulties with these types of comparisons is establishing the instance of torus collapse and determining the OTCP from quantities measured during the experiment. In many cases, torus collapse is gradual and the OTCP is not well-defined. However, in eight of the fifteen wind tunnel tests where the OTCP is well-defined, {{we find that the}} average of the relative differences (Pcr - OTCP/Pcr) was 8. 9 %.

On the other hand, <b>collapse</b> <b>pressures</b> of the mixed monolayer of TO and phospholipid (i. e., surface pressures of the mixed monolayer in equilibrium with the TO-liquid phase) at the interface changed with the monolayer composition and were lower than the spreading pressure.

No specific complex between TO and the phospholipid is required to explain the stability and collapse of the mixed monolayers.

The monolayer of the tp-dimer at air-water interface exhibited the coexistence of condensed and gas phases at large area per. molecule which on compression transformed to a uniform condensed phase at lower area per molecule (1. 80 nm(2)) and then collapsed at 1. 67 nm(2). The monolayer film transferred by Langmuir-Blodgett technique onto a hydrophilic silicon substrate was studied using an atomic force microscope. The topography image showed the film to be of height of about 1. 5 nm corresponding to the edge-on configuration of the triphenylene moieties.

Nowadays, the use of LPG as a fuel source in motor vehicles is steadily increasing. The LPG tanks in motor vehicles can be of toroidal shape. The toroidal LPG tanks are generally of non-circular cross-section, and may be supported at points, lines or patches on the surface. Among the mechanical properties of interest for toroidal LPG tanks are the static behavior under internal pressure, the vibration characteristics, the buckling and collapse loads, and the properties under impact loading arising from accident conditions. In the current work, a shell-theory finite element analysis is carried out of toroidal LPG tanks, with non-circular cross-section.

40|$|Saturated {{fatty acids}} ranging from fifteen to twenty carbons in alkyl chain length were spread as {{insoluble}} monomolecular films and compressed continually at constant velocities. As these surface films assume close-packing they exhibit a spontaneous loss in surface pressure when held at constant area per molecule or when compressed beyond an apparent collapse area, {{the greater the}} surface pressure compressed to the greater the rate of instability. Increasing chain length increases film stability but different behavior for odd and even carbon compounds has been noted for collapse pressures and for the rate of surface pressure loss. Comparison of saturated fatty acids with their methyl esters and their corresponding [alpha]-hydroxy acids indicates a change in stability in the order: [alpha]-hydroxy acids > fatty acids > methyl esters.
