The north end was remodeled into a caretaker's residence, although it had to be rebuilt to its original appearance after a fire destroyed it.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Watson left the P-I after he {{believed}} he was treated unfairly by a new editor, although he still contributed to the paper as a freelancer.

Watson remembered, [...] "I picked up the paper and saw the column wasn't in there. The managing editor <b>called</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he was thinking of cutting me back to one column a week.

We had largely all the elements of the episode in place and Fox <b>called</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Hey, how would you guys feel about if we asked you to have some musical element in the show? Anything, like just feature a song playing.' They didn't ask us to do Glee. And we instantly, before we got off the phone, said, 'Well, this is what we're thinking for the episode and here's an idea how that could work for us.' We turned their request into what felt like a positive for us and really deepened and sort of blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking it".|$|E

500|$|... "I {{brought it}} up at some point because the song that the title came from was 'Dusty', but my title for it was 'Down on the Upside', but Ben wrote the music and he called it 'Dusty'. So since we don't really like having song titles being {{the title of the}} record, 'cause it brings this weird, undue focus to the song, I thought it would be cool to call it Down on the Upside.

[...] "I'd {{been trying to get}} into voiceovers," [...] she explained, [...] "so they <b>called</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> it was a pilot they were doing for FX, and I could record the part on my day off in 10 minutes." [...] The actress read the script and recorded her lines at a recording studio in Phoenix, Arizona; upon first glance, Greer suggested that the raunchy and risque nature of the script would prevent any television stations from picking up the series. [...] "So when I found out it was picked up, I was like, 'Oh! Wait, I don't know what you're talking about.' They said, 'Remember that thing?' And I went, 'Really?' So then I recorded a bunch of them, and the scripts were the funniest scripts that I've ever read, and so crazy." ...|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam {{promoted}} the album with tours in Oceania and North America in 1998. Both {{were met with}} financial success, and the Australian shows in Melbourne sold out in just 17 minutes.

Pearl Jam's sound engineer Brett Eliason stated, [...] "We went and did Hawaii and Australia with Jack. When we came back, Jack wasn't {{in a position to}} carry on. He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He <b>called</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E

American comedian and actress Joan Rivers guest starred in the episode as Annie. She recorded her lines in March 2011. In an interview with E!

She further added that she is a fan of the show because it is [...] "so clever and so funny on so many levels. So when they <b>called</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Do you want to do it?' without even reading a script I said, 'Absolutely.'" [...] Adam Buckman, a former television columnist at the New York Post, noted on his blog that the story of the episode is similar to a period in Rivers' life {{at the end of the}} 1980s. At that time, she was hosting The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers on the Fox network. When Rivers challenged Fox executives who wanted to fire her husband Edgar Rosenberg as the show's executive producer, the network fired them both. Rosenberg committed suicide just three months later. Buckman wrote that the story of [...] "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution" [...] was [...] "no doubt devised with Rivers’ approval and possibly with her input", and that [...] "only a comedian of her stature and experience" [...] would attempt to spoof a personal tragedy such as this one. Other guest stars in the episode include actor Kevin Dillon and stand-up comedian Janeane Garofalo as themselves, and stand-up comedian Jackie Mason in a minor reprisal of his role as Krusty's father, speaking only one line.|$|E

Skiba remarked that [...] "We made the decision to form Heart & Skull to put out our own records after having been through every kind of label deal in the industry, big indies, small indies, majors. We knew it was time to adapt to the shifting tides of the music industry and we could not be more thrilled about doing that in conjunction with the team at Epitaph." [...] Singer and bassist Dan Andriano added: [...] "For our band at this time it really makes sense to release our own records, but we wanted to make sure we could partner up with good people who we would want to share in something very special to us. When Brett [...] <b>called</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he wanted to be involved, that was it. Epitaph is a label I've admired and supported for more than half of my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|William Kirk, {{driver of}} the steam tram car on the Derby-road, was summoned for using abusive and {{threatening}} language to Israel Jordan, {{driver of the}} Nottingham and Bulwell omnibus. Mr. W.H. Stevenson appeared for the complainant and Mr. Barlow for the defendant. Mr. Stevenson said this was another instance in which the Tramway Company endeavoured to monopolise all {{the streets in the}} town. There was a case before the Bench the other week in which the company summoned one of this complainant's drivers for being {{on the wrong side of}} the road. The Bench dismissed the case. The next day Mr. Jordan was driving along Derby-road when the defendant used abusive language to him, and said [...] "You beat us yesterday, but I'll be even with you before the week is out.
