Results of this research are: 1) only belonging, communication, personalization, rewarding, security and convenience which have the significant direct effects on the <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> orientation.   Also found that <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> orientation has a significant direct effect on the relationship outcome.   It means that five variables mentioned above, have the significant indirect effects on the relationship outcome through  the <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> orientation; 2) customization and differentiation don’t have the significant direct effects on the <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> orientation; so those don’t have the  indirect effects on the  relationship outcome through the <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> orientation.   The possibility {{of the reason why}} differentiation doesn’t have a significant effect is because this research doesn’t classify customers according to saving amount, so customers of this research are regular customers who probably don’t perceive the existence of differentiation on attention and special service provided by the bank.   Perhaps customers also consider customization as an unimportant thing, but more consider a superior product, a hassle-free process (quick, briefly, simple, convenience) and an interaction with pleasant human resources (warm, polite, skillful, and helpful) as more important things [...]   Keywords : relationship marketing, <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> orientation</p...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Marketing)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006 The {{effects of}} globalisation, local {{economic}} conditions, and {{developments in the}} service-, tourism-, and hotel industries, as well as increasing competitiveness, have led to {{major changes in the}} operating environment of South African hotels, in Gauteng particularly. These changes necessitate marketing responses from the hotels so that they can gain, but also (more profitably) retain customers. The present study develops a <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> framework for Gauteng hotels. The study's literature review reveals that service businesses, such as hotels, need to put in place competitive marketing strategies to improve competitiveness, and retain customers. Also, once demand is created for the hotel's offering, it needs to manage this demand, as well as its capacity to deliver. It transpires that <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> management has several components. It is important to build relationships with customers, manage customer-to-customer interaction to reduce dissatisfaction, as well as try to reduce potential defections. Also, service failures should be managed, and hotels have plans for service recovery. A questionnaire sent to a representative sample of Gauteng hotels determined their <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> management practices. The majority of these hotels do measure <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> rates and consider activities and strategies associated with <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> management as important in retaining guests. Gauteng hotels also conduct these activities frequently. It transpires too that different types and sizes of hotels, even those which do not measure their <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> rate, differ very little in the importance they give to <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> activities, and in the frequency with which such activities are performed. These results enable the formulation of a <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> framework for hotels in Gauteng, for use by any type of hotel, whatever its size. Doctora...|$|R

To date, <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> studies are mainly carried out on the macro or firm level instead of the individual customer level. This study develops a model of <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> management from the individual customer perspective. This model introduces multiple agents and considers the interactions among these individual agents (firms and customers). Specifically, to establish this multi-agent simulation paradigm, the paper uses customer trigger threshold, customer competence increment and stimulus-behavior mechanism to model micro customer behaviors, and then relates the customer behaviors with the customer retention/acquisition shares of the firms...|$|R

40|$|<b>Customer</b> <b>retention</b> is an {{important}} issue for any business, especially in mature markets such as the UK mobile market where new customers can only be acquired from competitors. Different methods and techniques have been used to investigate <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> including statistical methods and data mining. However, due to the increasing complexity of the mobile market, the effectiveness of these techniques is questionable. This study proposes Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation (ABMS) as a novel approach to investigate <b>customer</b> <b>retention.</b> ABMS is an emerging means of simulating behaviour and examining behavioural consequences. In outline, agents represent customers and agent relationships represent processes of agent interaction. This study follows the design science paradigm to build and evaluate a generic, reusable, agent-based (CubSim) model to examine the factors affecting <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> based on data extracted from a UK mobile operator. Based on these data, two data mining models are built {{to gain a better understanding}} of the problem domain and to identify the main limitations of data mining. This is followed by two interrelated development cycles: (1) Build the CubSim model, starting with modelling customer interaction with the market, including interaction with the service provider and other competing operators in the market; and (2) Extend the CubSim model by incorporating interaction among customers. The key contribution of this study lies in using ABMS to identify and model the key factors that affect <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> simultaneously and jointly. In this manner, the CubSim model is better suited to account for the dynamics of customer churn behaviour in the UK mobile market than all other existing models. Another important contribution of this study is that it provides an empirical, actionable insight on <b>customer</b> <b>retention.</b> In particular, and most interestingly, the experimental results show that applying a mixed <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> strategy targeting both high value customers and customers with a large personal network outperforms the traditional <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> strategies, which focuses only on the customer‘s value.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} interest {{in the field of}} <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> in the last two decades. Much of that interest has focused on the economics of <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> and developing plans and strategies for companies to follow to improve <b>customer</b> <b>retention.</b> There has been little research into what determines <b>customer</b> <b>retention,</b> particularly from the perspective of organisational climate. The purpose of this study, therefore, is {{to examine the relationship between}} employees' perceptions of organisational climate and <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> in a specific service setting. The methodology adopted for this study is a 'within method' triangulation approach, which uses predominantly qualitative research techniques, supported by quantitative research methods. The foundation of the research design is a set of six case studies of bank branches selected from the network of a major UK retail bank. The branches are similar to each other in every respect, except that three have high <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> rates and three have low retention rates. The main source of data is semi-structured interviews with a representative sample of six employees from each bank branch. This data is supported by survey data from a questionnaire that was completed by an the staff in all six branches. This questionnaire was also used as a platform from which to conduct the semi-structured interviews. Cross-case analysis between the two sets of branches is undertaken using the 'stacking comparable cases' approach, in order to systematically compare and contrast the differences between the high and low retairuing branches. The findings from the study show that there is a relationship between employees' perceptions of organisational climate and <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> at a micro-organisational level. It shows that organisational climate can be sub-divided into five climate themes and that within each climate theme there are dimensions which are critical to <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> and others which are less critical or irrelevant. Finally, the study highlights that it is the climate themes and dimensions taken together that form the climate for 6 customer care' and not the individual themes and dimensions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the impact of CRM on <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> in Iranian electronic banking. Iranian banks have used CRM more or less and proceeded to this issue with different rates of success. However, there are not available studies that investigated the impact of CRM in these banks especially in electronic environment. This study first reviews and analyzes the previous researches in the literature that investigate the relationship between CRM and firm performance and <b>customer</b> <b>retention.</b> Next, based on the RBV and process-oriented approach, we suggest a process-oriented framework that links CRM to <b>customer</b> <b>retention.</b> In order to be able to appropriately measure the extent of the usage of each of the research variables across organization, suitable dimensions for each of the research variables are defined based on the literature. In this regard, CRM resources are measured with five dimensions which are operational CRM technologies, collaborative CRM technologies, analytical CRM technologies, organizational, and human CRM resources. CRM processes are studied on both operational and management dimensions. Finally, <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> programs of CRM are studied in four dimensions including: customer service, customization, community of customers, and loyalty programs. A questionnaire has been designed and used to collect data from 286 top bank managers of two governmental (Refah and Maskan) and two private (Saman and Pasargad banks) banks’ branches in the province of Tehran. The gathered data have been analyzed using quantitative methods based on a survey strategy. The results of data analysis show the direct effect of all CRM resources including technological and infrastructural resources on CRM processes and also the direct effect of CRM processes on <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> programs of CRM (loyalty programs, customer service, customization, and creating community of customers) which themselves have direct effect on <b>customer</b> <b>retention.</b> Another contribution of this study is that it presents a comprehensive set of <b>customer</b> <b>retention</b> programs of CRM and it studies the correlation between each of them and <b>customer</b> <b>retention.</b> Validerat; 20110214 (anonymous...|$|R
