5|$|Bigfin reef squids and {{the common}} octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were studied to resolve a century-long debate over whether {{cephalopods}} <b>can</b> <b>hear.</b> Unlike fishes, cephalopods do not possess air-filled swim bladders, which might amplify sound waves travelling in water. The results were published in 2009. It showed that bigfin reef squids and octopuses utilise their statocysts for detecting vibrations, an organ primarily used for maintaining spatial orientation. The common octopus <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. Bigfin reef squids have a slightly better hearing range of 400Hz to 1500Hz. Both hear best at a frequency of 600Hz. Relatively, their hearing is comparable to prawns and some other invertebrates but is less sensitive than that of most fishes.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees do {{not have}} ears, {{and it is not}} known whether or how well they <b>can</b> <b>hear.</b> However, they are {{sensitive}} to the vibrations made by sound travelling through wood or other materials.|$|E

5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} hearing and can detect an extremely {{broad range of}} frequencies. They <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> higher-pitched sounds than either dogs or humans, detecting frequencies from 55Hz to 79,000Hz, a range of 10.5octaves, while humans and dogs both have ranges of about 9octaves. Cats <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> ultrasound, which is important in hunting because many species of rodents make ultrasonic calls. However, they do not communicate using ultrasound like rodents do. Cats' hearing is also sensitive and among the best of any mammal, being most acute {{in the range of}} 500Hz to 32kHz. This sensitivity is further enhanced by the cat's large movable outer ears (their pinnae), which both amplify sounds and help detect the direction of a noise.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} episode, Wirt and Greg wake up in a hospital, with Greg telling a story but being cut off before we <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> what it's about. As the scene ends, Greg's frog begins to glow, due to having eaten a magic bell in The Unknown, {{suggesting}} that there was at least some physical aspect to the story. The series ends with a slow montage of how Wirt and Greg affected the inhabitants of the Unknown.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the final}} orchestral crescendo, the song ends {{with one of}} the most famous final chords in music history. Overdubbed in place of the vocal {{experiment}} from 10 February, this chord was added during a session at EMI's Studio Two on 22 February. Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on a harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.|$|E

5|$|I <b>Can</b> <b>Hear</b> the Heart Beating as One is {{the eighth}} studio album by the American indie rock band Yo La Tengo, {{released}} on April 22, 1997, by Matador Records. It {{was produced by}} Roger Moutenot and recorded at House of David in Nashville, Tennessee. The album expands the guitar-based pop of its predecessor Electr-O-Pura to encompass {{a variety of other}} music genres, including bossa nova, krautrock, and electronic music. Most of the songs on the album deal with melancholy emotions and range from short and fragile ballads to long and open-ended dissonance.|$|E
5|$|Like other whales, males make long, loud, low-frequency sounds. The vocalizations of {{blue and}} fin whales are the lowest-frequency sounds made by any animal. Most sounds are frequency-modulated (FM) down-swept {{infrasonic}} pulses from 16 to 40hertz frequency (the range of sounds that most humans <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> falls between 20hertz and 20kilohertz). Each sound lasts one to two seconds, and various sound combinations occur in patterned sequences lasting 7 to 15 minutes each. The whale then repeats the sequences in bouts lasting up to many days. The vocal sequences have source levels of up to 184–186decibels relative to 1micropascal at a reference distance of one metre and can be detected {{hundreds of miles from}} their source.|$|E
5|$|Many insects possess very {{sensitive}} and, or specialized organs of perception. Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) {{is known for}} its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound; while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2kHz, and some grasshoppers <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> up to 50kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats, which helps them avoid predation. Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.|$|E

5|$|Nier defeats the pair, with Emil sacrificing {{himself to}} ensure his friends' progress. The {{remaining}} group then defeats the Shadowlord. It is {{revealed that the}} Shadowlord's true identity is the Gestalt form of the Nier from the prologue; the Nier the player has been controlling {{for the majority of}} the game is his Replicant. Driven to protect his Yonah, he was the first Gestalt and has combined her with the Replicant Yonah. The original Yonah, however, tells the Gestalt Nier that she <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> the new Yonah inside her, and that she loves the Replicant Nier and deserves the body just as much. She vacates the body, and Nier and Yonah are reunited.|$|E
5|$|Oregon’s {{state courts}} are courts of general jurisdiction, unlike federal courts. That is, the state courts <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> all cases {{regardless}} of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the Oregon Supreme Court <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn decisions of the Oregon court, Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts. Federal courts are not required to follow the decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for decisions based on federal law, regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state. However, federal courts are bound to follow Oregon law and decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those federal courts are not based in Oregon, per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason federal courts, and courts from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).|$|E

5|$|Cats {{are similar}} in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong {{flexible}} body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and {{a better sense of}} smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.|$|E
5|$|Charged {{with the}} crime of heresy, based on her claim of visions and signs from God, she is tried in an ecclesiastical court proceeding, which is forced by the English {{occupation}} government. The English wish to quickly condemn and execute Joan since English soldiers are afraid to fight while she remains alive, based on their belief that she could supernaturally affect battles even while in prison. Bishop Cauchon expresses his fear of wrongfully executing someone who might have received visions from God. About to be burned for heresy, Joan is distraught {{that she will be}} executed without making a final confession. The Bishop tells her she must recant her visions before he <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> her confession. Joan signs the recantation. The relieved Bishop shows the paper to the English, saying that Joan can no longer be burned as a heretic. Whilst in her cell, Joan is confronted by an unnamed cloaked man (Dustin Hoffman), who is implied to be Joan's conscience. The man makes Joan question whether she was actually receiving messages from God.|$|E
5|$|Decatur House (748 Jackson Place NW) is {{allegedly}} {{haunted by}} the ghost of Stephen Decatur. In 1820, Commodore James Barron challenged Commodore Decatur to a duel over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair of 1807. The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach. Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22. A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the house—standing in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW or leaving {{the back door of}} the house with a box of dueling pistols. So many witnesses saw the specter of Decatur that the window was walled up. Some people have also claimed that they <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> his widow, who became hysterical at his death, weeping in the house.|$|E

5|$|Enemies <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> {{footsteps}} and other sounds. When Fiona is {{in a dangerous}} situation, she may fall into a panic. During panic mode, visibility gets worse, the menu can't be opened, and she will begin running on her own, tripping and falling into walls. Panic mode will elapse after some time, or certain items {{can be used to}} calm her down. If Fiona sustains a significant amount of damage, she will slow down and become unable to backstep. If she receives too much damage she can die. Damage heals with time or items can be used to bring her vitality back to normal. While some items are used to heal Fiona and Hewie, others are used to damage enemies. Some can be thrown while others are set like traps for the enemy to walk over. Some items are found by searching while others can be crafted in refining rooms.|$|E
5|$|General Edward Braddock left Observatory Hill in Georgetown in 1755 on an {{expedition}} to capture the French Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War. Braddock's expedition was surprised on July 9 {{in the vicinity of}} present-day Braddock, Pennsylvania, in what is now known as the Battle of the Monongahela. Nearly 900 of Braddock's 1,300 men were killed or wounded, and Braddock himself killed. Since before the American Civil War, witnesses say that on the anniversary of Braddock's departure they <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> shouted military orders, horses' hooves on cobblestones, the sound of men marching, and the sound of metal clanking against metal. The sounds can be heard near the old Long Bridge or near the Georgetown bluffs overlooking the Potomac River.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) asks Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to {{accompany}} him to the Six Sigmas Retreat in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, following his Bush administration and CEO debacles. There, Jack meets with the Six Sigmas, six men who each embody a core feature of Six Sigma: teamwork, insight, brutality, male enhancement, hand-shake-fulness and play-hard. They disapprove of Liz's antics during the team building exercises and demand that Jack distance himself from her {{if he wants to}} succeed, which he does. Before his dinner speech, Jack psyches himself up in the men's room, completely forgetting that he is wearing a microphone and that everyone <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> him. Liz quickly takes the stage to draw attention away from Jack's embarrassment and finally ends up ripping her blouse open and dancing in front of everyone. She succeeds, and is banned from the retreat forever.|$|E
