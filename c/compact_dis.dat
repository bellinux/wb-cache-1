40|$|All gamma-ray bursts are {{observed}} to have {{approximately the same}} characteristic gamma-ray energy. We show in this article that for bursts in the BATSE data set, this property {{as measured by the}} E-peak value is not an instrumental effect, but a physical property of gamma-ray bursts.

40|$|A {{new theory}} for gamma-ray burst {{radiation}} is presented. In this theory, magnetic fields and relativistic electrons are created through plasma processes arising as a relativistic shell {{passes through the}} interstellar medium. The gamma-rays are produced through synchrotron self-Compton emission. It is found that shocks do not arise in this theory, and that efficient gamma-ray emission only occurs for a high Lorentz factor and a high-density interstellar medium. The former explains the absence of gamma-ray bursts with thermal spectra. The latter provides the Compton attenuation theory with an explanation of why the interstellar medium density is always high. The theory predicts {{the existence of a}} class of extragalactic optical transient that emit no gamma-rays.

40|$|This {{investigation}} of a decade of discussion on the uses of media for adult learning continues a collection of information that was initiated in September 1974 in an earlier bibliography. This report describes the methodology and search strategies employed in {{a comprehensive review of}} research on the applications of visual and digital technologies to adult learning and major related issues as reported in the literature from June 1982 through June 1992. A review of thr) ERIC database found 7, 144 potential entries under the descriptor "Adult Education. " Searching for descriptors related to educational technology and adult education indicated that technological terms were associated with adult education 4, 716 times. Many connections were found for distance education and instructional design issues, but relatively few were found for the newer aspects of technology such as <b>compact</b> <b>dis...</b>|$|E
