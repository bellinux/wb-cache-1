We explore conditions under which near-subsistence scenarios may imply wage traps, labor market failures that can be the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>undernourishment,</b> illiteracy, and child labor. After stating general conditions under which wage traps occur, we look at specific production functions typically employed in quantitative analyses of growth and development. We find that standard Cobb-Douglas production functions do not permit wage traps, whereas CES functions do.

40|$|Disease-related malnutrition, {{the most}} {{frequent}} <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>undernourishment</b> in industrialized countries, appears to be highly prevalent among western patient populations, interesting up to 60 % of the hospitalized and almost one fifth of the persons attending to the general medicine service. There are several reasons for this high prevalence, among which pathology-related causes, inadequate presentation of the meals in hospitals and institutions, and low recognition of nutritional problems by health professionals. Several {{studies have shown that}} undernourished patients have higher morbidity and mortality rates than the general population and suffer of more and more severe complications, leading to prolonged hospital stays and worse clinical outcomes. This determines a much higher Health costs, estimated in an English study as a yearly additional burden of over 7 billion £ for the National Heath Service. Nutritional interventions, such as the administration of oral supplements or enteral tube feeding, are capable to increase body mass index (BMI), that is considered the most reliable indicator of the nutritional status, muscle strength and overall psycho-physical performance, determining an improved quality of life and a reduced need for medical assistance. These functional improvements go alongside with better clinical outcomes, as shown by a reduced mortality rate, shorter hospital stays and lower incidence of complications observed after supplementation. Studies that have analyzed the economical impact of nutritional supplementation in terms of cost-benefit have shown that the cost of enteral nutritional interventions is almost negligible when compared to the associated savings in the production of the health service, mainly determined by lower hospitalization rates, shorter hospital stays, reduced costs for the treatment of complications and for the consultation of specialists. Greater awareness of the health professionals and more encouraging health policies toward nutritional interventions are required to reduce the clinical and economical impact of this unnecessarily wide-spread condition...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals Report, 2015, {{documents}} that, since 1990, {{the number}} of stunted children in sub-Saharan Africa has increased by 33 % {{even though it has}} fallen in all other world regions. Recognizing this, in 2011 the Government of Uganda implemented a 5 -year Nutrition Action Plan. One important tenet of the Plan is to lessen malnutrition in young children by discouraging over-consumption of nutritionally deficient, but plentiful, staple foods, which it defines as a type of food insecurity. Methods We use a sample of 6101 observations on 3427 children age five or less compiled from three annual waves of the Uganda National Panel Survey to measure undernourishment. We also use the World Health Organization’s Child Growth Standards to create a binary variable indicating stunting and another indicating wasting for each child in each year. We then use random effects to estimate binary logistic regressions that show that greater staple food concentrations affect the probability of stunting and wasting. Results The estimated coefficients are used to compute adjusted odds ratios (OR) that estimate the effect of greater staple food concentration on the likelihood of stunting and the likelihood of wasting. Controlling for other relevant covariates, these odds ratios show that a greater proportion of staple foods in a child’s diet increases the likelihood of stunting (OR =  1. 007, p =  0. 005) as well as wasting (OR =  1. 011, p =  0. 034). Stunting is confirmed with subsamples of males only (OR =  1. 006, p =  0. 05) and females only (OR =  1. 008, p =  0. 027), suggesting that the finding is not gender specific. Another subsample of children aged 12  months or less, most of whom do not yet consume solid food, shows no statistically significant relationship, thus supporting the validity of the other findings. Conclusion Diets containing larger proportions of staple foods are associated with greater likelihoods of both stunting and wasting in Ugandan children. Other <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> stunting and wasting identified in past research are also confirmed with the Uganda data. Finally, the analysis provides clues to other possible <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>undernourishment</b> in young children...|$|R

The paper provides supporting literature and empirical evidence that one key factor driving the measured calorie decline is incomplete collection of data on food consumed away from peoples’ homes, which is widespread and rapidly increasing.

Methodology: The nutritional status of the patients was assessed using body mass index (BMI), triceps skinfold thickness (TSF) and the mid-upper arm circumference.

We employ a panel dataset covering 63 developing countries from 2001 to 2010 to make a comprehensive assessment of the effects of food price inflation and volatility on population health measured by infant mortality rate, child mortality rate, and the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>undernourishment.</b> We find that rising food prices have a significant and adverse effect on all three health indicators in developing countries. Furthermore, the impact of food prices is severer in the least developing countries although the effect is moderated in countries with a greater share of agriculture in gross domestic product...|$|R
40|$|FAO measure <b>of</b> <b>undernourishment</b> is {{calculated}} based on three main parameters: dietary energy supply (DES), minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER), and {{the coefficient of}} variation of dietary energy consumption (CV). In the current implementation of this methodology, the DES and the MDER change over time, as would be expected. The CV, however, remains constant. However, we expect the CV to change over time and be a function of income and prices. This paper discusses why the CV should change in response to changes in these variables, and suggests a practical way to estimate changes in the CV over time in the absence of survey data. Income, prices, consumption, undernourishment, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Food Security and Poverty, E 21, O 11, O 19,...|$|R
5000|$|Another aspect {{that deserves}} {{attention}} {{is that people}} of lower SES usually live in less secure neighborhoods where walking around might present a danger. In addition, these places in general do not show a lot of establishments that offer healthy food. As a study conducted in New York found, the [...] "walkability" [...] of one's neighborhood {{and the lack of}} availability of healthy food establishments are also predictors of obesity (Muñez Oliveira, 23). Finally, although today Mexico shows a lower level <b>of</b> <b>undernourishment,</b> many <b>of</b> the now young adults used to suffer from nutritional stunting in early life, which is also considered to increase the risk of becoming overweight or obese later in life (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations).|$|R
40|$|Some {{women in}} rural Pakistan are chronically undernourished, and {{consequently}} underweight. Concerns have been expressed {{that the degree}} <b>of</b> <b>undernourishment</b> might be sufficiently severe to affect lactation performance. We have obtained data on maternal body composition and infant breast milk intake using stable isotope methods {{in a group of}} thirty three mother and infant pairs at approximately six months of age. The maternal body mass index ranged from 16. 6 to 29. 1 kg·m- 2 . In this population we found that exclusive breast-feeding tended to be associated with lower maternal body fat, {{and that there was no}} evidence for compromised lactational performance due to malnourishment. Finally we note that when our data is combined with that from other studies there may be a generalised negative correlation between breast milk intake and maternal body fat...|$|R
