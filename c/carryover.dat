Cortana replaced Windows' embedded search feature, supporting both text and voice input. Many of its features are a direct <b>carryover</b> from Windows Phone, including integration with Bing, setting reminders, a Notebook feature for managing personal information, as well as searching for files, playing music, launching applications and setting reminders or sending emails. Cortana is implemented as a universal search box located alongside the Start and Task View buttons, which can be hidden or condensed to a single button.|$|E
5|$|From Lexington Avenue, where NY390 passes {{into the}} town of Greece, north to NY104, NY390 runs {{parallel}} to {{the western edge of}} Eastman Business Park, the large production and distribution complex owned and maintained by Eastman Kodak. Midway between the Lexington Avenue and West Ridge Road exits, NY390 encounters Ridgeway Avenue via a partial diamond interchange. Just north of Ridgeway Avenue, the expressway crosses a small, narrow strip of land that lies within the Rochester city limits, a <b>carryover</b> from when the Erie Canal occupied this tract and entered the city decades before. North of the strip, NY390 curves to the northeast, passing along {{the west side of the}} industrial park and the eastern edge of a residential yet wooded area to reach NY104. Heading northbound, it splits into two halves, with exit24A connecting to NY104 east and exit24B linking to NY104 west.|$|E

25|$|An {{increase}} in crime and liberalization {{of the mass}} media in the 1990s led to many questions concerning the effectiveness of the police force in investigating and fighting crime, as opposed to its prior concentration on crowd and riot control, a <b>carryover</b> from the martial law era.|$|E

50|$|The power {{supplies}} for CMOS are called VDD and VSS, or VCC and Ground(GND) {{depending on the}} manufacturer. VDD and VSS are <b>carryovers</b> from conventional MOS circuits and stand for the drain and source supplies. These do not apply directly to CMOS, since both supplies are really source supplies. VCC and Ground are <b>carryovers</b> from TTL logic and that nomenclature has been retained {{with the introduction of}} the 54C/74C line of CMOS.|$|R

The Convertible model counted for over 20% of all the Monzas sold. Sporty image means big profits.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the {{legislature}} again proposed two amendments. The first proposal passed, repealing a constitutional ban on all lotteries.

A <b>carryover</b> 1977 Hornet AMX decal was available for the rear deck and hood, in either gold with orange or black with gold. Polished forged aluminum 5-spoke road wheels were optional.|$|E
25|$|MinION's high {{error rate}} (~10-40%) {{prevented}} identification of antimicrobial resistance markers, for which single nucleotide resolution is necessary. For {{the same reason}} eukaryotic pathogens were not identified. Ease of <b>carryover</b> contamination when re-using same the flow cell (standard wash protocols donâ€™t work) is also a concern. Unique barcodes may allow for more multiplexing. Furthermore, performing accurate species identification for bacteria, fungi and parasites is very difficult, as they share a larger portion of the genome, and some only differ by <5%.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the first}} generation, the {{interior}} was not as customizable in the second generation, and many options that were previously available were cut for 1992. The second generation now used only a single seat design shared with all models (the first generation LX got its own unique seat design), and was only available in two configurations; with a front bench seat and a column mounted shifter, or with front bucket seats and a center console with a floor mounted shifter. The console was a <b>carryover</b> from the first generation, although it was redesigned for 1993.|$|E

50|$|Many parts {{being used}} were {{leftovers}} {{from the time}} of the frames, or <b>carryovers</b> from the motorcycle and motocross industry.

25|$|The second-generation Taurus shared {{all of its}} {{mechanical}} parts with the first-generation Ford Taurus, yet its exterior and interior were nearly completely redesigned. However, its exterior still strongly resembled that of the first-generation Taurus, leading many to falsely believe that the second-generation was simply a facelift of the first-generation Taurus. This is partially true, however, as the wagon model, from the B-pillar {{to the rear of}} the car, was a <b>carryover</b> from the first generation. The second generation of Taurus proved to be very popular, selling 410,000 units in its first year, becoming the best selling car in the United States.|$|E
25|$|A small {{rivalry with}} the Pittsburgh Pirates {{stems from the}} close {{proximity}} of the two cities, and features some <b>carryover</b> elements from the longstanding rivalry in the National Football League (NFL) between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers. Because the Indians' designated interleague rival is the Reds and the Pirates' designated rival is the Detroit Tigers, the teams have played periodically, with one three-game series per season from 1997 to 2001, 2003, 2006, 2009 to 2012, and 2015. Since 2012, the Indians and Pirates play one three-game series every three seasons when the AL Central Division plays the NL Central Division {{as part of the}} interleague play rotation. Through the 2015 meetings, the Pirates lead the series 19â€“17.|$|E
25|$|The 1974 Rambler American was a <b>carryover.</b> The only {{difference}} was {{the presence of}} the rear five-mile-per-hour bumper and the rear license plate was relocated {{to the center of the}} rear panel over the gas filler. The standard wheels for the year were VAM's new 14x6-inch five-spoke design with volcano hubcaps. The 258 six included an evaporative canister to reduce emissions, and a slightly lower 8.3:1 compression ratio. However, during the mid-year, the compression ratio was lowered even more to 7.6:1. In both cases, the engines were still advertised as having an output of 170hp. The seat and door panel designs were revised. The parking brake pedal received a new smaller rubber pad.|$|E

50|$|Some MDPL {{messages}} were direct <b>carryovers</b> from MIDI, given more pronounceable names {{in order to}} avoid ambiguity, but most {{messages were}} new and based on a very different, although innovative control logic.
