25|$|From {{at least}} 1904 {{through to the}} last decade of the 20th Century, the {{constitutional}} basis of most Australian federal industrial relations legislation was the conciliation and arbitration power.

25|$|Critics of long {{residency}} hours {{trace the}} problem {{to the fact that}} a resident has no alternatives to positions that are offered, meaning residents must accept all <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> including very long work hours, and that they must also, in many cases, contend with poor supervision. This process, they contend, reduces the competitive pressures on hospitals, resulting in low salaries and long, unsafe work hours.|$|E

25|$|The {{financial}} and social <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> {{of the workers}} were very favourable and unusual for the time. To retain his workforce, Riquet paid his workers well enough. More importantly, he gave benefits never before seen such as non-working rain days, Sundays and public holidays, and finally paid sick leave. The employment contract was individual and is done by free recruitment. Pay was, at the beginning, 20 sols (1 livre) per day, double the agricultural wage. Discontent from farm owners, however, forced Riquet to reduce pay to 15, then 12 sols per day. In 1668 he established the monthly payment of 10 livres.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, the WorkChoices {{reforms were}} passed by Federal Parliament. There were many {{elements}} in the reforms, including some which elicited political and social controversy and consternation. In a legal sense, perhaps the two most fundamental changes were (1) the purported elimination of State and Territory workplace relations legislation from the federal industrial landscape and (2) the attempt to rely almost completely on the corporations power directly to prescribe minimum terms and <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> regardless {{of the existence of}} an intrastate industrial dispute. This unprecedented (but not novel) use of the corporations power to enact federal industrial legislation was accompanied by claims that 85% of the Australian workforce would be covered by WorkChoices.|$|E

Whybrow (No 3) was one of 11 decisions of the High Court referred to by the Attorney-General, Billy Hughes, as cutting down the Commonwealth's powers until they were futile and justifying the changes proposed in the 1913 referendum.

Section 4 of the Judges Remuneration and <b>Conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>Employment</b> Act 47 of 2001 has extended the term limit to an effective term of 15 years including prior service on other courts: the effect is that judges who had served more than 3 years before their appointment to the Constitutional Court retain a 12-year term limit; {{those who did not}} have a longer tenure. The same section extends the retirement age to 75. However, in terms of section 3(2)(b), if the judge has already been a judge (in any court) for 15 years by the time she reaches the age of 65, she may voluntarily retire.|$|E

500|$|The Truax case {{involved}} a Mr. William Truax {{who owned a}} restaurant called [...] "English Kitchen," [...] in Bisbee, Arizona. A Mr. Michael Corrigan and others were former cooks and waiters at the restaurant.

The restaurant’s business was allegedly harmed, and Mr. Truax sued various parties {{on a variety of}} grounds. The lawsuit was thrown out by the trial court before the case could be heard, on the theory that Mr. Truax was incorrect as a matter of law. Mr. Truax appealed and the case eventually ended up in the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the trial court should not have thrown out the lawsuit, but should have heard Mr. Truax’s case. The case was sent back to the trial court so that a trial could take place. Truax was not a tax case. No issues involving taxation were presented to or decided by the Court.|$|E
500|$|Owen was {{actively}} involved in efforts to outlaw child labor. [...] He served as co-sponsor of the Keating-Owen Act of 1916, aimed at prohibiting the sale in interstate commerce of goods manufactured with child labor in the United States. In 1918, the Act was struck down as unconstitutional by a five-to-four decision of the Supreme Court in Hammer v. Dagenhart, evincing a noted dissent by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. Following the Court's decision, Owen initially made an unsuccessful attempt to pass the legislation again with limited modification. In the event, the Congress responded to the Court's decision with the Child Labor Tax Law of 1919, which would have taxed products from child labor (and which in turn was declared unconstitutional in 1922 by an 8 to 1 vote in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co.). In 1924, the Congress sought to amend the Constitution to give itself the power to regulate child labor. [...] Finally, in 1941, after Owen's retirement from active political life, a unanimous Supreme Court in United States v. Darby Lumber Co. overruled the 1918 decision (in the process endorsing and going beyond the principles set forth in Holmes's dissent) and ruled that the Commerce Clause gave Congress the right to regulate <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b>|$|E
