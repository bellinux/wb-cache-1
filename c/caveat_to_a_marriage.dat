5000|$|Reservations are {{essentially}} <b>caveats</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> state's {{acceptance of a}} treaty. Reservations are unilateral statements purporting to exclude or to modify the legal obligation {{and its effects on}} the reserving state.

40|$|We {{compute the}} Fourier phase spectra {{for the light}} curves of five low-luminosity active galactic nuclei {{observed}} by EXOSAT. There is no statistically significant phase coherence in any of them. This statement is equivalent, subject <b>to</b> <b>a</b> technical <b>caveat,</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> demonstration that their fluctuation statistics are Gaussian. Models in which the X-ray output is controlled wholly by a unitary process undergoing a nonlinear limit cycle are therefore ruled out, while models with either {{a large number of}} randomly excited independent oscillation modes or nonlinearly interacting spatially dependent oscillations are favored. We also demonstrate how the degree of phase coherence in light curve fluctuations influences the application of causality bounds on internal length scales...|$|R

30|$|The most {{important}} <b>caveat</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> “narrow” cost-benefit analysis of actual program participation {{is that one}} has to take into account impacts of not offering the program that go well beyond the fact that each participant would have been a non-participant.

An important feature of welfare state economies is that the use of sanctions and duration limits in UI insurance, on the one hand, and the use of ALMPs, on the other, are intimately related, {{in the sense that the}} former would be politically unfeasible without the latter. Given that poverty-prevention has been declared a top priority, one simply cannot take families’ basis of existence away without offering alternative income options.|$|R
