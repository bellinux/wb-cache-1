25|$|Gears {{inside a}} {{windmill}} convey {{power from the}} rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>bearing.</b> It has the brake around {{the outside of the}} rim and teeth {{in the side of the}} rim which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In grist mills, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each millstone. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} sixteen pole {{electric motor}} designed by Captain Krebs to develop [...] at 200V and 200A was constructed at the Societe des Forges et Chantiers at Le Havre, was 1 metre {{in diameter and}} weighed 2 tonnes.

Once installed {{it was found that}} the <b>rear</b> <b>bearing</b> was inaccessible and could not be repaired with the motor installed. It was difficult to inspect the armature or repair damage to the insulation. The motor was not designed to come to an immediate halt when power was disconnected, but instead would freewheel to a halt relatively slowly. Reverse power could not be applied until it had stopped moving, so it was not possible to immediately reverse the propeller in case of emergency. The motor proved so problematic that it was replaced with a smaller but more powerful Sautter-Harlé motor.|$|R

50|$|In addition, {{since the}} coal bunker was {{mounted on the}} frame instead of on the engine unit, the <b>rear</b> pivot <b>bearings</b> were subject to quite rapid wear since they carried a {{considerable}} additional vertical load compared to those on a purebred Garratt.

40|$|Novel {{rotating}} machinery design concepts and architectures are being explored to reduce mass, energy consumption, manufacturing costs, and environmental impact while increasing performance. As component manufacturers supply parts to original equipment manufacturers, {{it is desirable}} to design the components using a systems approach {{so that they are}} optimized for system-level performance. To accomplish that, suppliers must be able to model and predict the behavior of the whole machinery. Traditional computer-aided design/computer-aided engineering master-modeling approaches enable manual changes to be propagated to linked models. Novel knowledge-based master-modeling approaches enable automated coordination of multidisciplinary analyses. In this article, we present a specific implementation of such a knowledge-based master-modeling approach that facilitates multidisciplinary design optimization of {{rotating machinery}}. The master-model (MM) approach promotes the existence of a single governing version of the product definition as well as operating scenarios. Rules, scripts, and macros link the MM to domain-specific models.

5000|$|C. variopedatus builds {{and lives}} {{permanently}} in a tough, flexible, papery U-shaped tube buried in soft substrate with both ends protruding like little chimneys.

The middle section bears parapodia. On the 12th segment these are modified into long wing-like structures which secrete mucus and form a bag. The parapodia on segments 13, 14 and 15 are fused into three paddle-shaped, piston-like structures, the purpose {{of which is to}} pump water through the tube. The water is drawn in through the anterior end and expelled through the posterior end, passing through the fine mesh of the mucus bag where food particles get trapped.

2500|$|The {{investigation}} eventually {{determined that}} the rotors in the cabin pressurisation blower on number 2 engine began to break up, resulting in severe vibration that loosened the nuts securing the oil metering unit to the blower and allowed oil to escape freely. [...] The <b>rear</b> <b>bearing</b> {{of one of the}} rotors also came free, so the rotor gyrated, causing metal-to-metal contact and great heat. [...] The blower was located aft of the firewall, and a fire started {{in the rear of the}} nacelle when the escaping oil was ignited by contact with the hot metal in the damaged blower. The fire burned the engine control rods, preventing feathering of the propeller. [...] Burning oil flowed into the wheel bay and from there into the leading edge of the left wing, where the fire breached the wall of a fuel tank. The abundant supply of fuel caused the fire to spread throughout much of the left wing and become so intense it caused softening of aluminium alloy and loss of strength of the upper boom (or upper flange) in the wing spar. The spar was critically weakened in the region between number 1 and 2 engines.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a numerical investigation using the {{finite element method}} on the vibratory behavior of a single spool gas turbine designed for unmanned aerial vehicle applications.

Three radial clearances for the squeeze film damper were analyzed to determine the best geometric configuration for the <b>rear</b> <b>bearing,</b> considering the rotordynamic performance of the entire system. Whirl speeds and unbalanced system responses were carefully evaluated to determine the best radial clearance for the squeeze film damper. After defining the best radial clearance, a transient analysis was performed to simulate the transition of the system through resonance, and a spectral map is presented to illustrate the vibratory behavior of the system considering the influence of all related important frequencies. The rotordynamic behavior of the system is predicted, and vibration problems are avoided. Its mechanical drawings were released to manufacturing, and the first prototype is in the experimental test phase, thus indicating that the numerical results presented in this study are consistent...|$|R
