25|$|A <b>cutting</b> <b>torch</b> head {{is used to}} cut materials. It {{is similar}} to a welding torch, but can be {{identified}} by the oxygen blast trigger or lever.|$|E
25|$|When cutting, {{the metal}} is first heated by the flame {{until it is}} cherry red. Once this {{temperature}} is attained, oxygen is supplied to the heated parts by pressing the oxygen-blast trigger. This oxygen reacts with the metal, forming iron oxide and producing heat. It is the heat that continues the cutting process. The <b>cutting</b> <b>torch</b> only heats the metal to start the process; further heat {{is provided by the}} burning metal.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the name}} Bermuda Star, {{the ship was}} {{undergoing}} a $25 million ($ today) overhaul by Southwest Marine, Inc at the Port of Portland, Oregon in December 1989 when a fire broke out on board. The fire resulted in a five alarm response and five of the crew went to a local hospital for treatment of smoke inhalation. The fire started on the promenade deck and was started by a <b>cutting</b> <b>torch.</b> Damage was estimated at $2 million ($ today).|$|E

25|$|For cutting, {{the setup}} {{is a little}} different. A <b>cutting</b> <b>torch</b> has a 60- or 90-degree angled head with {{orifices}} placed around a central jet. The outer jets are for preheat flames of oxygen and acetylene. The central jet carries only oxygen for cutting. The use of several preheating flames rather than a single flame {{makes it possible to}} change the direction of the cut as desired without changing the position of the nozzle or the angle which the torch makes with the direction of the cut, as well as giving a better preheat balance. Manufacturers have developed custom tips for Mapp, propane, and polypropylene gases to optimize the flames from these alternate fuel gases.|$|E
25|$|By the 1920s, most banks avoided using safes {{and instead}} turned to gigantic, heavy vaults with walls and doors several feet thick. These {{were meant to}} {{withstand}} not only robbers but also angry mobs and natural disasters. Despite the new security measures, these vaults were still vulnerable to yet another new invention, the <b>cutting</b> <b>torch.</b> Burning oxygen and acetylene gas at about , the torch could easily cut through steel. It was in use as early as 1907, but became widespread with World War I. Robbers used cutting torches in over 200 bank robberies in 1924 alone. Manufacturers learned to sandwich a copper alloy into vault doors. If heated, the high thermal conductivity of copper dissipates the heat to prevent melting or burning. After this design improvement, bank burglaries fell off and were far less common {{at the end of}} the 1920s than at the beginning of the decade.|$|E
500|$|In 1915 Turpin {{worked as}} a diver in efforts to raise the sunken {{submarine}} USS F-4 in Honolulu, Hawaii. [...] He became qualified as a [...] "Master Diver" [...] - most probably the first African-American sailor to do so. [...] (It is often erroneously reported that Master Chief Petty Officer Carl Brashear held this honor.) [...] Turpin was also credited with being involved {{with the development of}} the underwater <b>cutting</b> <b>torch.</b>|$|E

50|$|As a {{testimonial}} to {{the integrity}} of the original design, the explosive detonations used for the first demolition attempt resulted in the whole structure remaining intact and simply listing to one side, still held firmly together by its network of external supporting braces. Subsequently, the braces were cut away using large industrial <b>cutting</b> <b>torches.</b>|$|R
500|$|Serious {{flooding}} {{started to}} quickly overwhelm Utah {{and she began}} to list to port and settle by the stern. As the crew began to abandon ship, one man—Chief Watertender Peter Tomich—remained below decks to ensure as many men as possible could escape, and to keep vital machinery running as long as possible; he received the Medal of Honor posthumously for his actions. At 08:12, Utah rolled over onto her side, while those crew members who had managed to escape swam to shore. Almost immediately after reaching shore, the ship's captain, Commander Solomon Isquith, heard knocking from men trapped in the capsized ship. He called for volunteers to secure a <b>cutting</b> <b>torch</b> from the badly damaged cruiser [...] and attempt to free trapped men; they succeeded in rescuing four men. In total, 64 officers and men were killed, though 461 survived.|$|E
2500|$|Drilling {{a hole in}} a {{metal part}} {{is the most common}} example of a chip {{producing}} process. [...] Using an oxy-fuel <b>cutting</b> <b>torch</b> to separate a plate of steel into smaller pieces is an example of burning.

2500|$|A {{reinforcing}} (rebar) ironworker, colloquially {{known as}} a [...] "Rodbuster", works with reinforcing bars to make structures based on a certain design. [...] Reinforcing ironworkers assemble structures with reinforcing bars by tying the bars together with tie wire. [...] They place the rebar inside of forms, so concrete can be poured over [...] top of them to form a solid structure. When reinforcing floors, concrete blocks are used to raise the rebar off of the deck, so no rebar can be seen underneath of {{the deck of the}} floor after the forms are stripped. In addition, ironworkers often have to cut the steel that they have for a job to fit into certain positions. [...] For example, the rebar will have to be cut with a <b>cutting</b> <b>torch,</b> so it can fit around a drain. [...] In some instances, welded wire fabric is used to help strengthen concrete; however, it is difficult to place this fabric in the concrete because it must be placed while the concrete is being poured into the forms.|$|E

50|$|On 20 April 1989, Hector was leased to Pakistan and renamed MOAWIN. She was {{returned}} to U.S. custody at Singapore in 1994, and on 17 October of that year was sold to Ruby Enterprises of India. Subsequently, the USS Hector AR-7 suffered an ignominious demise by <b>cutting</b> <b>torches</b> at a nondescript scrap metal yard somewhere on the coastline of India.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{two people}} who was killed was Heinz Schmodta, a 62-year-old German cook. The other person was E. H. Miller, a 31-year-old British able seaman from Dunham. Just before the crash {{he went to the}} toilet in the fourth {{carriage}} and was crushed by the concertina effect. With the help of <b>cutting</b> <b>torches</b> his body was removed from the train.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, another {{officer of the}} Italian special unit, Lieutenant Licio Visintini, himself a veteran of {{previous}} submarine incursions against the “Rock”, learned about Olterra and conceived {{the idea of a}} secret mother ship for the maiali. Maiale (literally “pig”) is the Italian nickname for the human torpedoes. Under the pretext of raising the ship to sell it to a Spanish owner, a team of members of the Decima, disguised as Italian civilian workers, took control of the tanker. The ship was towed to Algeciras, where “repairs” were started. The Italian Navy personnel were helped by two civilian members of the crew. They had remained on board the half sunken oiler along with a Spanish guard for more than two years, {{in order to protect the}} rights of the Italian company which owned Olterra. Once at docks, some of Olterras cargo holds and a boiler room were modified by Visintini men into a workshop for the assembling and maintenance of human torpedoes. An improvised observation post was also mounted on the forecastle to watch the Bay of Gibraltar and the Allied ships at anchor there. A scene of civilian sailors working to overhaul the ship was meanwhile set up for the outsiders, in order to deceive both British and Spanish authorities. The torpedoes (in spare parts) and other equipment were smuggled into Spain by men of the Decima under the pretense of being materials for the ‘works’ on board Olterra. [...] Finally, a sliding hatch was opened with a <b>cutting</b> <b>torch</b> six feet below the waterline. This would be the exit door of the manned torpedoes, which would launch their attacks from the flooding bilge, right beneath the workshop. The special unit in charge of the operations was dubbed Squadriglia Ursa Major, after the constellation of the same name.|$|E

This {{modified version of the}} grid generator offers users a great flexibility in grid and geometry choice, and offers the advantage of easy variations in boundary conditions. The work presented also includes a detailed study of the effect of the radiation model and the cathode current density boundary condition on the distribution of the plasma field quantities.

50|$|Burn {{tables are}} CNC <b>cutting</b> <b>torches,</b> usually natural gas powered. Plasma and laser cutting tables, and Water jet cutters, are also common. Plate steel is loaded {{on a table}} and the parts are cut out as programmed. The support table is made of a grid of bars that can be replaced. Some very {{expensive}} burn tables also include CNC punch capability, with a carousel of different punches and taps. Fabrication of structural steel by plasma and laser cutting introduces robots to move the cutting head in three dimensions around the material to be cut.|$|R
