The overall decrease in absorption <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>stretching</b> modes observed {{with increasing frequency}} {{is consistent with the}} experimental observations. It is related to a decrease in the magnitude of the hydrogen Born effective charge tensor projected along the OH bond as a function of increasing H-bonding. The scatter of theoretical data shows that the use of a general calibration of infrared absorbances in minerals cannot lead to accurate water contents. In contrast, the combination of theoretical modeling and experimental measurements should improve the determination of the hydrogen distribution among structurally distinct OH defects in nominally anhydrous minerals...|$|R
40|$|We aim {{to answer}} the {{question}} about the cross-section of a planar coronal loop with a prescribed shape. We restrict the analysis to coronal loops embedded in a planar potential magnetic field. Then we carry out the analysis in the leading-order approximation with respect to the small parameter ϵ equal to the ratio of the characteristic size of the loop cross-section to the loop length. We show that, in this approximation, the loop cross-section can be prescribed arbitrarily at one of its footpoints. Then the loop cross-section at any other point is obtained by stretching or compressing the prescribed loop cross-section in the direction that is perpendicular to the loop axis and in the plane of the loop. The variation <b>of</b> the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>stretching</b> or compression along the loop can be chosen arbitrarily. In particular, it follows from this result that we can consider a planar loop of arbitrary shape and assume that its cross-section is circular everywhere and has a constant radius...|$|R
30|$|The CWI {{measurements}} {{performed in}} the laboratory and in the simulation {{are based on a}} <b>stretching</b> approach <b>of</b> the whole signal, the first arrivals being a negligible part of the signal. Sens-Schönfelder and Wegler (2006) proposed to estimate the relative time differences ε[*]=[*]δt/t in the late part of the signal between two successive acquired waveforms, as the factor by which the time axis of one of the traces must be stretched or compressed to obtain the best correlation with the other trace. In this technique, one defines “stretched” versions of one of the waveform of the pair such as S(t)[*]=[*]R((1 [*]+[*]a)t), with a given <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>stretching</b> a. Following Sens-Schönfelder and Wegler (2006) and Larose and Hall (2009), we use a spline interpolation in the time domain to stretch the waveform. We then calculate the cross-correlation function between the other unstretched waveform of the pair with several stretched waveforms. The relative time shift—i.e., the relative variation of delay with time, assuming a linear variation of the delays in the coda—is equal to the value of a corresponding to the maximum of the cross-correlation function. This method is applied to the first 0.5  ms of the seismograms.|$|R

For wafers with a thickness of 7 - 9 mg/ cm 2 quantitative measurements <b>of</b> absorption <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> C-H <b>stretching</b> bands were possible. More pronounced shifts of C-H bands toward lower frequencies indicated that the perturbation of the corresponding bonds in ethane upon adsorption by the bivalent Ca 2 + or Mg 2 + ions was much stronger than by the monovalent Na+ ions. In addition, the integral extinction <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> the C-H <b>stretching</b> bands <b>of</b> ethane adsorbed by Na+ ions was only about 53 % of that of gas-phase ethane. For adsorption on the bivalent Ca 2 + or Mg 2 + ions the <b>coefficients</b> exceeded those <b>of</b> the free ethane molecule, indicating strong polarization of the C-H bonds during the vibration. Bands representing the fully symmetric C-H stretching vibrations, which are IR inactive for free ethane, were perturbed most strongly upon adsorption. Their intensities reached up to 60 % of the total intensity in the C-H stretching region. In contrast, the intensities of the other C-H bands were several times lower than for free ethane. These trends indicate anisotropy in the polarizability of the adsorbed molecules. In addition, the absorption coefficients indicate a weaker adsorption and polarization of ethane by Mg 2 + than by Ca 2 + ions in Y zeolite. Because of their smaller ionic radius, the Mg 2 + cations are more strongly shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework than the Ca 2 + cations, and therefore, their polarizing ability is decreased...|$|R

A refinable linear {{functional}} {{is one that}} can be expressed as a convex combination and defined by a finite number <b>of</b> mask <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> certain <b>stretched</b> and shifted replicas of itself. The notion generalizes an integral weighted by a refinable function. The key to calculating a Gaussian quadrature formula for such a functional is to find the three-term recursion coefficients for the polynomials orthogonal with respect to that functional. We show how to obtain the recursion coefficients by using only the mask coefficients, and without the aid of modified moments. Our result implies the existence of the corresponding refinable functional whenever the mask coefficients are nonnegative, even when the same mask does not define a refinable function. The algorithm requires O(n 2) rational operations and, thus, can in principle deliver exact results. Numerical evidence suggests that it is also effective in floating-point arithmetic. 1.

Here we introduce a method of incorporating the motion of charged atoms lining the pore into Brownian dynamics simulations of ion conduction. The movements of the carbonyl groups in the selectivity filter of the KcsA channel are calculated explicitly, allowing their bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angels to change in response to the forces acting upon them. By systematically changing the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> bond <b>stretching</b> and <b>of</b> angle bending, the carbon and oxygen atoms can be made to fluctuate from their fixed positions by varying mean distances. We show that incorporating carbonyl motion in this way does not alter the mechanism of ion conduction and only has a small influence on the computed current. The slope conductance of the channel increases by ∼ 25 % when the root mean-square fluctuations of the carbonyl groups are increased from 0. 01 to 0. 61 Å. The energy profiles and the number of resident ions in the channel remain unchanged.

Data from the experiments of Clasen et al. [J. Rheol. 50, 849 - 881 (2006) ] however show {{that that is}} not the case. The Weissenberg number is observed to systematically decrease with concentration in nominally dilute solutions to values well below the critical value of 1 / 2 for the coil-to-stretch transition to reach a minimum around the critical-overlap concentration c*, and thereafter increase in semidilute solutions. Conformation dependence of the polymeric friction coefficient and the phenomenon of coil-stretch hysteresis are shown to play vital roles in determining capillary thinning dynamics. A key result is that when steady-state coil-stretch hysteresis exists, transient polymer conformations during capillary thinning evolve quasistatically along the unstable manifold of the hysteresis window. It is further found necessary to account for changes in polymeric friction due to intermolecular interactions as chains stretch in the flow. A new constitutive model for unentangled polymer solutions is proposed combining blob concepts to account for the effect of hydrodynamic screening on the average friction <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> partially <b>stretched</b> chains.

Four types of OH-defects are considered: fully protonated magnesium vacancies, fully protonated silicon vacancies, silicon vacancies compensated by a magnesium cation and two protons, and OH-defects associated with the migration of a silicon cation to a normally vacant site, as reported by Kudoh and Inoue (1999). The {{results suggest that the}} main absorption band constituted by a doublet (3326 and 3360 cm- 1) corresponds to at least two types of OH-defects involving M 3 vacancies with protonation of the O 1 -type O atoms along the O 1 [...] . O 4 edges. The main contribution of the less intense band at 3581 cm- 1 is likely related to the partial protonation of a silicon vacancy (protonation of the O 3 -type oxygen) associated with the migration of the silicon cation to the Si 2 site. This assignment is consistent with several experimental constraints: wavenumber and pleochroism of infrared OH-stretching bands, pressure-dependence of the band wavenumber, evidence from X‑ray diffraction of magnesium vacancies in M 3 site, and increase of the b/a axial ratio with water content. The integrated absorption <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> the corresponding OH-defects are also calculated and thus complement the set of data obtained previously for forsterite and ringwoodite.
