30|$|In July 2008, Mr. Zhang, {{together}} with other policy entrepreneurs, suggested a new health insurance policy that combined basic employee health insurance with urban–rural resident health insurance into one basic health insurance system. All residents of Nanguo City, including employees, unemployed, self-employed, and rural residents, would be covered by this unified health insurance program. Regardless of work status, residents would share equal <b>contribution</b> fee rates <b>and</b> <b>reimbursement</b> standards. The successful policy implementation not only solved the social problem of increasing demand for health security in Nanguo City without extra expenditure but also helped the Nanguo municipal government gain the reputation of treating migrant workers as equal to local citizens. Because of its achievements in social security reform, in 2009, Nanguo City was awarded the title of “National Model City of Social Development” by the State Council. The SSDNC also benefited from this policy innovation in that it became an important institution in maintaining social stability and acquired a dominant influence {{in the area of}} social policy.|$|R

40|$|Background: In the European Member States, {{the systems}} for {{pharmaceutical}} pricing <b>and</b> <b>reimbursement</b> differ significantly. Amongst {{the administration and}} policy-makers at both national and European levels {{there is a lot}} of interest in the different pharmaceutical systems of the Member States as a means of learning from their experiences in pricing <b>and</b> <b>reimbursement.</b> Objectives: The general objective of the PPRI–Project – started in April 2005 - is to develop a network of authorities and institutions in order to improve information and knowledge on the pharmaceutical systems in the enlarged European Union. This network should facilitate a regular exchange of information and allow a process of learning from each other. Project description: The PPRI project team consists of the main partner (ÖBIG), an associated partner (WHOEURO) and a network of partners and observers which represent national stakeholders from almost all EU Member States and a number of international stakeholders.  The information on pharmaceutical pricing <b>and</b> <b>reimbursement</b> will be collected and summarised in country reports (“Pharma Profiles”) which follow a homogenous structure. The individual country’s information will be analysed and compared on the basis of a set of indicators (benchmarks). Deliverables:The main deliverables of the project are: • Pharma Profiles, • a benchmarking report, in which pharmaceutical pricing <b>and</b> <b>reimbursement</b> in the Member States is compared,• a website containing information on the project and on pricing <b>and</b> <b>reimbursement</b> in the Member States, and • a conference at the end of the project during which the study results will be disseminated...|$|R

40|$|Psychologists {{in health}} care {{settings}} today find {{it increasingly difficult to}} obtain authorization <b>and</b> appropriate <b>reimbursement</b> for psychological ssessments from 3 rd party payers. Authorization <b>and</b> <b>reimbursement</b> denials often are based on allegations that empirical support for the utility and validity of psychological tests is nonexistent or limited. This article reviews a sample of the considerable empirical support that exists for the utility and validity of a variety of psychological tests {{for a wide range of}} clinical health care applications. Informed by data such as these, psychologists should become more effective in their abilities to seek authorization <b>and</b> <b>reimbursement</b> for assessment <b>and</b> overturning denials. Obtaining authorization <b>and</b> <b>reimbursement</b> for psychological assessments from third party payers has become increasingly dif-ficult for psychologists (Eisman et al., 2000; Piotrowski, Belter, & Keller, 1998). Difficulty obtaining preanthorization, limitations in instrument selection and time, and reduced or nonexistent remu-neration for psychological assessments have become the norm. As a result, psychologists now use psychological assessment less frequently than in the past (Eisman et al., 2000; Piotrowski et al. ...|$|R
