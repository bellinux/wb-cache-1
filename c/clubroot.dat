500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{bacterial}} diseases to affect cabbage is black rot, caused by [...] Xanthomonas campestris, which causes chlorotic and necrotic lesions that start at the leaf margins, and wilting of plants. <b>Clubroot,</b> caused by the soilborne slime mold-like organism Plasmodiophora brassicae, results in swollen, club-like roots. Downy mildew, a parasitic disease caused by the oomycete Peronospora parasitica, produces pale leaves with white, brownish or olive mildew on the lower leaf surfaces; this is often confused with the fungal disease powdery mildew.|$|E
2500|$|The name calomel {{is thought}} {{to come from the}} Greek καλός beautiful, and μέλας black; or [...] καλός and μέλι honey from its sweet taste. The black name (somewhat {{surprising}} for a white compound) is probably due to its characteristic disproportionation reaction with ammonia, which gives a spectacular black coloration due to the finely dispersed metallic mercury formed. [...] It is also referred to as the mineral horn quicksilver or horn mercury. Calomel was taken internally and used as a laxative, for example to treat George III in 1801, and disinfectant, {{as well as in the}} treatment of syphilis, until the early twentieth century. Until fairly recently it was also used as a horticultural fungicide, most notably as a root dip to help prevent the occurrence of <b>clubroot</b> amongst crops of the Brassicaceae family.|$|E
5000|$|Historical {{reports of}} <b>clubroot</b> {{date back to}} the 13th century in Europe. In the late 19th century, a severe {{epidemic}} of <b>clubroot</b> destroyed large proportions of the cabbage crop in St. Petersburg. The Russian scientist Mikhail Woronin eventually identified the cause of <b>clubroot</b> as a [...] "plasmodiophorous organism" [...] in 1875, and gave it the name Plasmodiophora brassicae.|$|E
50|$|Liming {{has been}} an {{effective}} control measure to curb <b>clubroot</b> since the 19th century. This method does not eradicate <b>clubroot</b> but it will slow its development by creating unfavorable conditions. In addition, calcium and magnesium {{can be added to}} the nutrition profile of the soil to help control <b>clubroot.</b> To get efficient results the field soil, pH must be kept above 7.5. This takes massive applications to field soil in order to treat all of the soil where spores of <b>clubroot</b> are found. Combining lime with one other treatment has shown most effective.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clubroot</b> {{gets its}} name from its primary symptom: {{enlargement}} of the plant roots. The abnormally large roots are unable to properly absorb water and nutrients {{from the ground and}} the result is cabbages that are undersized, wilted, and discolored. If left uncontrolled yield losses due to <b>clubroot</b> can be as high as 50%. The only fungicide shown to be effective in treating <b>clubroot</b> is PCNB.|$|E
50|$|It {{includes}} the species Plasmodiophora brassicae, which causes the disease cabbage <b>clubroot.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Clubroot</b> {{can be a}} reoccurring {{problem for}} years because it is easily spread from plant to plant. P. brassicae is able to infect 300 species of cruciferous plants, making this disease a {{recurring}} problem even with crop rotation. This wide host range allows the pathogen to continue its infection cycle {{in the absence of}} cabbages. Additionally, cabbage <b>clubroot</b> may be a stubborn disease due to its ability to form a microbial cyst as an overwintering structure. These cysts may last many years in the soil until it comes into contact with a suitable host, making it difficult to entirely avoid the introduction of the disease. Those growing cabbage {{need to be aware of}} the possibility of Plasmodiophora infestation by simply growing in particular fields that may have had cabbage <b>clubroot</b> previously.|$|E
50|$|In 2003 <b>clubroot</b> was {{identified}} in Alberta, Canada, as an outbreak in canola crops {{in the central}} area of the province mainly isolated to the Edmonton area. <b>Clubroot</b> is a soilborne disease caused by the biotrophic protist Plasmodiophora brassica. The infection causes the formation of large galls on the roots which look like clubs. These formations impede nutrient and water uptake and can cause plant death, wiping out important money generating canola crops. Initially 12 commercial fields of canola were identified, but that number grew to over 400 by 2008.|$|E
50|$|In 18th, 19th {{and early}} 20th century Britain <b>clubroot</b> was {{sometimes}} called finger and toe, fingers and toes, anbury, or ambury, {{these last two}} also meaning a soft tumor on a horse.|$|E
50|$|Cabbage <b>Clubroot</b> affects cabbage, Chinese cabbage, and Brussels sprouts most {{severely}}, {{but it has}} a {{range of}} hosts that it affects less severely like kohlrabi, kale, cauliflower, collards, broccoli, rutabaga, sea kale, turnips, and radishes.|$|E
50|$|The {{potential}} of cultural practices to reduce crop losses due to <b>clubroot</b> is limited, and chemical treatments {{to control the}} fungus are either banned due to environmental regulations or are not cost effective. Breeding of resistant cultivars therefore is a promising alternative.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clubroot</b> is {{a disease}} that prefers warmer {{temperatures}} and moist conditions. Ideal conditions for the proliferation of this disease would be a soil temperature between 20-24 °C and a pH less than 6.5; therefore, this disease tends to be prominent in lower fields where water tends to collect.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clubroot</b> (born Dan Richmond, c. 1985) is a dubstep {{musician}} {{located in}} St Albans, England. Signed to Lo Dubs, he released his eponymous debut album in 2009. The second album, II - MMX, {{was released in}} 2010. His music is often compared by similarity of deep, dark electronic sound with Burial.|$|E
50|$|Weeds {{can also}} host pests and {{diseases}} that can spread to cultivated crops. Charlock and Shepherd's purse may carry <b>clubroot,</b> eelworm can be harboured by chickweed, fat hen and shepherd's purse, while the cucumber mosaic virus, which can devastate the cucurbit family, is carried by {{a range of}} different weeds including chickweed and groundsel.|$|E
50|$|After {{receiving}} his doctorate, {{moved to}} the University of Glasgow in 1966 to work with Percy Wragg Brian. In Glasgow he taught and carried out research in Botany, Plant Pathology and Biotechnology. During this time he extended {{his work on the}} interaction between pathogens and host tissue cultures, notably with Plasmodiophora brassicae, cause of <b>clubroot</b> of brassicas.|$|E
50|$|A very {{important}} breeding {{aim is to}} get varieties with resistance to pests and diseases. There exist varieties with resistance to turnip mosaic virus but as mentioned above, there exist numerous other diseases. There have been attempts to breed varieties with <b>clubroot</b> resistance or powdery mildew resistance but the varieties failed due to bad leaf texture traits or broken resistances.|$|E
50|$|Crop {{rotation}} with non-host crops {{is another}} method {{to help prevent}} <b>clubroot.</b> The half life of P. Brassicae is 3.6 years. Unfortunately, long rotations of approximately 20 years are {{required in order to}} be effective. This is very difficult with typical canola rotations not being more than three years. Canola crop brings in high revenue to farmers. This would also require complete removal of Cruciferae crops, such as wild radish and mustard.|$|E

50|$|This is {{a popular}} {{ornamental}} plant, widely cultivated for its abundant, fragrant flowers in spring. Many cultivars have been developed, in shades of yellow, orange, red, maroon, purple, brown, white and cream. It associates well in bedding schemes with other spring flowers such as tulips and forget-me-nots. It is usually grown as a biennial, sown one year to flower the next, and then discarded. This is partly because of its tendency to grow spindly and leggy during its second year, but more importantly its susceptibility to infections such as <b>clubroot.</b>|$|E
5000|$|European {{production}} of biodiesel from energy crops has grown steadily {{in the last}} decade, principally focused on rapeseed used for oil and energy. Production of oil/biodiesel from rape covers more than 12,000 km² in Germany alone, and has {{doubled in the past}} 15 years. [...] Typical yield of oil as pure biodiesel may be is [...] or more, making biodiesel crops economically attractive, provided sustainable crop rotations exist that are nutrient-balanced and preventative of the spread of disease such as <b>clubroot.</b> Biodiesel yield of soybeans is significantly lower than that of rape.|$|E
50|$|Some {{fungicide}} {{has been}} found to help with <b>clubroot</b> but it is very pricey and would take huge amounts to saturate the soil. The best way to prevent contamination between fields is to clean agricultural equipment and vehicles which have come in contact with club root before moving to a new field. All contaminated soil, equipment and tools must not be moved to clean, disease-free fields. The best preventative method is field monitoring. Throughout the season, plants should be monitored for early symptoms of club root. More research is being conducted for early detection of club root in fall soils.|$|E
50|$|Most {{wallflower}} garden cultivars (e.g. Erysimum 'Chelsea Jacket') {{are derived}} from E. cheiri (often placed in Cheiranthus), from southern Europe. They are often attacked by fungal and bacterial disease, so they are best grown as biennials and discarded after flowering. They are also susceptible to <b>clubroot,</b> a disease of Brassicaceae. Growth is best in dry soils with very good drainage, and they are often grown successfully in loose wall mortar, hence the vernacular name. There is {{a wide range of}} flower color in the warm spectrum, including white, yellow, orange, red, pink, maroon, purple and brown. The flowers, appearing in spring, usually have a strong fragrance. Wallflowers are often associated in spring bedding schemes with tulips and forget-me-nots.|$|E
50|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to eradicate the pathogen once it is introduced to a field, there are several methods for its control. Keeping the soil at a slightly basic pH of 7.1-7.2 by the addition of agricultural lime as well as the integration of crop rotation will reduce the occurrence of cabbage <b>clubroot</b> in already infected fields. Fumigation using metam sodium in a field containing diseased cabbages is yet another way to decrease the buildup of the pathogen. Control and management practices on already infected fields help to reduce the overall impact that P. brassicae has on a field of cabbage and other cruciferous plants, but it is extremely difficult to rid an individual plant of the disease once it is already infected.|$|E
50|$|Fluazinam is a {{protectant}} fungicide, but {{is neither}} systemic or curative. It acts by inhibiting the germination of spores {{and the development}} of infection structures. Although it has activity against many fungi, it is less potent against rusts and powdery mildew and as such has not been commercialised for use in cereal crops. It is widely used to control late blight (P. infestans) in potato due to its activity against the zoospores of the pathogen which makes it particularly effective at controlling infection of the potato tubers. Despite its common usage to control late blight, there are no reports of resistance to fluazinam appearing in P. infestans. Fluazinam is also used to control Sclerotinia on peanuts and turf, Botrytis on grapes and beans and <b>clubroot</b> in brassicas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clubroot</b> is {{a common}} disease of cabbages, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, radishes, turnips, stocks, wallflowers and other plants {{belonging}} to the family Brassicaceae (Cruciferae). It is caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, which was once considered a slime mold but is now put in the group Phytomyxea. It is the first Phytomyxea for which the genome has been sequenced. It has as many as thirteen races. Gall formation or distortion takes place on latent roots and gives {{the shape of a}} club or spindle. In the cabbage such attacks on the roots cause undeveloped heads or a failure to head at all, followed often by decline in vigor or by death. It is an important disease, affecting an estimated 10% of the total cultured area worldwide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Clubroot</b> is {{very hard}} to control. The primary step for {{management}} and long-term control is exclusion of the disease. Good sanitation practice is important with regard to the use of tools and machinery in order to prevent the introduction of the pathogen to a disease-free field. It is not uncommon for an inattentive farmer or gardener to unknowingly carry in the pathogen after being previously exposed to it at a different time. One should avoid purchasing infected transplants of cabbage so as to prohibit the infestation of P. brassicae. Soil type is also an important factor in the development and spread of cabbage clubroot; the use of sand will allow for the plants to grow in well-drained soil, thereby eliminating the possibility of the pathogen to proliferate in a hospitable environment.|$|E

50|$|Cabbage <b>Clubroot</b> is {{a disease}} of Brassicaceae (mustard family or cabbage family) caused by the soil-borne Plasmodiophora brassicae. The disease first appears {{scattered}} in fields, but in successive seasons it will infect the entire field, reducing the yield significantly and sometimes resulting in no yield at all. Symptoms appear as yellowing, wilting, stunting, and galls on the roots. It is transmitted by contaminated transplants, animals, surface water runoff, contaminated equipment, and irrigation water. The pathogen can survive in a field for years as resting spores without a host present and will infect the next crop planted {{if it is a}} susceptible host. This pathogen prefers a wet climate and a pH around 5.7, so proper irrigation and the addition of compounds that raise the pH can be used to control this disease. Other control methods include sanitation to prevent transmission, chemical control, and resistant varieties.|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of fungi from bamboo rhizosphic soils as endophytic and biocontrol agents of <b>clubroot</b> disease (Plasmodiophora brassicae) on Brocoli. <b>Clubroot,</b> caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae {{is a serious}} soilborne disease of plants worldwide, capable of severe infection on broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower. <b>Clubroot</b> is the most destructive diseases on cruciferae in Indonesia. The existing control measures, including biological control do not provide satisfactory result. The objective {{of the study was}} to explore fungi from bamboo rhizospheric soils as endophytic that can suppress <b>clubroot</b> disease in broccoli. There were two steps in this study: (1) exploration and identification of fungi from bamboo rhizospheric soils. (2) Effectiveness test of the fungi in suppressing <b>clubroot</b> disease. There were four species of fungi as endophytes in brocoli in this study, e. g Aspergillus sp., Mortierella sp., Paecilomyces sp., and Chaetomium globosum. They had colonized broccoli root endophytically and suppressing <b>clubroot</b> disease. Paecilomyces sp. of endophytic fungi can suppress <b>clubroot</b> diseases incidence for 18. 75 %...|$|E

40|$|<b>Clubroot,</b> {{caused by}} Plasmodiophora brassicae Woronin, {{is a serious}} plant disease of cruciferous plants. A field survey of {{occurrence}} of <b>clubroot</b> in oilseed fields was conducted in Finland in 2007 − 2009 and in 1984 − 1989. At present, the disease is distributed throughout the oilseed cultivation area. <b>Clubroot</b> was found on average from 30 % of fields, but its severity was low; fields with high numbers of infected plants and plants with severe symptoms were rare. According to the survey, cultivation frequency of cruciferous plants {{is the most important}} factor affecting <b>clubroot</b> occurrence and severity. <b>Clubroot</b> was found in soils {{with a wide range of}} pH-values (pH 5 - 7. 6), but symptoms were most severe at low pH. According to the survey, and greenhouse and field trials, high temperature and moisture during the early growth period seem to favour disease development and can cause significant yield losses. In a survival trial, <b>clubroot</b> declined to close to zero after four years in the absence of host plants, but traces of the pathogen were still detectable after a 19 -year trial period, making eradication of the pathogen very difficult...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe role of {{salicylic}} acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling in resistance to root pathogens has been poorly documented. We assessed {{the contribution of}} SA and JA to basal and partial resistance of Arabidopsis to the biotrophic <b>clubroot</b> agent Plasmodiophora brassicae. SA and JA levels {{as well as the}} expression of the SA-responsive genes PR 2 and PR 5 and the JA-responsive genes ARGAH 2 and THI 2. 1 were monitored in infected roots of the accessions Col- 0 (susceptible) and Bur- 0 (partially resistant). SA signaling was activated in Bur- 0 but not in Col- 0. The JA pathway was weakly activated in Bur- 0 but was strongly induced in Col- 0. The contribution of both pathways to <b>clubroot</b> resistance was then assessed using exogenous phytohormone application and mutants affected in SA or JA signaling. Exogenous SA treatment decreased <b>clubroot</b> symptoms in the two Arabidopsis accessions, whereas JA treatment reduced <b>clubroot</b> symptoms only in Col- 0. The cpr 5 - 2 mutant, in which SA responses are constitutively induced, was more resistant to <b>clubroot</b> than the corresponding wild type, and the JA signaling-deficient mutant jar 1 was more susceptible. Finally, we showed that the JA-mediated induction of NATA 1 drove N(δ) -acetylornithine biosynthesis in infected Col- 0 roots. The 35 S::NATA 1 and nata 1 lines displayed reduced or enhanced <b>clubroot</b> symptoms, respectively, thus suggesting that in Col- 0 this pathway was involved in the JA-mediated basal <b>clubroot</b> resistance. Overall, our data support the idea that, depending on the Arabidopsis accession, both SA and JA signaling can play a role in partial inhibition of <b>clubroot</b> development in compatible interactions with P. brassicae...|$|E
40|$|In Arabidopsis thaliana the {{induction}} of plant trehalase during <b>clubroot</b> disease was proposed {{to act as}} a defense mechanism in the susceptible accession Col- 0, which could thereby cope with the accumulation of pathogen-synthesized trehalose. In the present study, we assessed trehalose activity and tolerance to trehalose in the <b>clubroot</b> partially resistant accession Bur- 0. We compared both accessions for several trehalose-related physiological traits during <b>clubroot</b> infection. A quantitative trait loci (QTLs) analysis of tolerance to exogenous trehalose was also conducted on a Bur- 0 xCol- 0 RIL progeny. Trehalase activity was not induced by <b>clubroot</b> in Bur- 0 and the inhibition of trehalase by validamycin treatments resulted in the enhancement of <b>clubroot</b> symptoms only in Col- 0. In pathogen-free cultures, Bur- 0 showed less trehalose-induced toxicity symptoms than Col- 0. A QTL analysis identified one locus involved in tolerance to trehalose overlapping the confidence interval of a QTL for resistance to Plasmodiophora brassicae. This colocalization was confirmed using heterogeneous inbred family (HIF) lines. Although not based on trehalose catabolism capacity, partial resistance to <b>clubroot</b> is to some extent related to the tolerance to trehalose accumulation in Bur- 0. These findings support an original model where contrasting primary metabolism-related regulations could contribute to the partial resistance to a plant pathogen...|$|E
40|$|<b>Clubroot</b> {{caused by}} Plasmodiophora brassicae, is a severe disease of cruciferous crops that causes large hypertrophic galls in the roots. The plant {{microbiome}} {{is important for}} growth promotion and disease suppression. In this study, using 16 S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing techniques, we compared the endosphere microbiome of symptomatic and asymptomatic B. napus roots infected with P. brassicae collected from the same natural <b>clubroot</b> field. The {{results showed that the}} microbial population and its relative abundance in the asymptomatic roots was far higher than that in the symptomatic roots, and that many microorganisms in asymptomatic roots have biological control and plant growth promotion functions that may be related to <b>clubroot</b> symptoms. These results suggest the importance of the endosphere microbiome in <b>clubroot</b> disease and provide potential bio-control resources for its prevention...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNitrogen {{levels can}} {{modulate}} {{the effectiveness of}} <b>clubroot</b> resistance in an isolate- and host-specific manner. While the same QTL were detected under high and low nitrogen, their effects were altered. <b>Clubroot,</b> caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, {{is one of the}} most damaging diseases of oilseed rape and is known to be affected by nitrogen fertilization. However, the genetic factors involved in <b>clubroot</b> resistance have not been characterized under nitrogen-limiting conditions. This study aimed to assess the variability of <b>clubroot</b> resistance under different nitrogen levels and to characterize the impact of nitrogen supply on genetic resistance factors. Linkage analyses and a genome-wide association study were conducted to detect QTL for <b>clubroot</b> resistance and evaluate their sensitivity to nitrogen. The <b>clubroot</b> response of a set of 92 diverse oilseed rape accessions and 108 lines derived from a cross between 'Darmor-bzh' (resistant) and 'Yudal' (susceptible) was studied in the greenhouse under high- and low-nitrogen conditions, following inoculation with the P. brassicae isolates eH and K 92 - 16. Resistance to each isolate was controlled by a major QTL and a few small-effects QTL. While the same QTL were detected under both high and low nitrogen, their effects were altered. <b>Clubroot</b> resistance to isolate eH, but not K 92 - 16, was greater under a low-N supply versus a high-N supply. New sources of resistance were found among the oilseed rape accessions under both low and high-N conditions. The results are discussed relative to the literature and from a crop improvement perspective...|$|E
