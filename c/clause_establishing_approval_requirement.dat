5000|$|Property-related fees or {{charges for}} sewer, water, or refuse {{collection}} services {{are exempt from}} the voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirement.</b> [...] Since the exemptions represent exceptions to a voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirement,</b> the election exemptions are strictly construed. [...] Nevertheless, most property-related fees or charges fall within an election exemption as typical utility fees for water, sewer, or refuse collection services. Examples of new or increased property-related fees or charges that ordinarily require an election include stormwater fees or flood control fees.|$|R
2500|$|Section 2 of Article XIII C {{contains}} the voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirements</b> for local government taxes. [...] Under Proposition 218, every local government tax {{is either a}} general tax or a special tax. [...] Proposition 218 does not allow a local tax to be a hybrid tax. [...] The type of tax a local government imposes (general or special) is legally significant because it determines the applicable voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirement.</b> [...] Special purpose districts or agencies, including school districts, have no power to levy general taxes and can only impose special taxes. [...] This restriction is based on prior judicial interpretations of Proposition 13. [...] As a practical matter, only a city or a county {{has the power to}} levy a general tax under Proposition 218. [...] The voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirement</b> under Proposition 218 was upheld by a California appellate court.|$|R
2500|$|The California Cannabis Coalition {{decision}} has raised issues concerning whether the voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirements</b> for local tax increases under Proposition 218 {{also apply to}} local tax initiatives placed on the ballot by the electorate exercising the local initiative power. [...] However, the California Cannabis Coalition case did not involve the voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirements</b> under Proposition 218, but rather involved a narrow election timing issue (the election consolidation requirement) applicable only to general taxes which under Proposition 218 may only be levied by cities or counties in California.|$|R
2500|$|Section 3 of Proposition 218 added Article XIII C to the California Constitution. [...] Article XIII C relates {{primarily}} to local government taxes, including applicable voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|R
2500|$|India in 1997 allowed {{foreign direct}} {{investment}} (FDI) in cash and carry wholesale. Then, it required government <b>approval.</b> The <b>approval</b> <b>requirement</b> was relaxed, and automatic permission was granted in 2006. Between ...|$|R
2500|$|New local {{government}} taxes require voter approval under Proposition 218. [...] The term “imposed” {{for purposes of}} triggering the voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirement</b> under Proposition 218 typically refers to the first enactment of a tax.|$|R
2500|$|While the California Cannabis Coalition {{decision}} {{applied only}} to the election timing requirement for general taxes under Proposition 218, in Altadena Library District v. Bloodgood, 192 Cal. App. 3d 585 (June 1987) the two-thirds voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirement</b> for special taxes under Proposition 13, a different and older constitutional taxpayer protection provision, has previously been applied to a local initiative tax increase proposed by the electorate exercising the local initiative power. [...] That constitutional two-thirds voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirement</b> under Proposition 13 is independent of Proposition 218 tax restrictions. [...] The California Cannabis Coalition decision did not overrule or otherwise disturb the 1987 Altadena Library District appellate court decision.|$|R

25|$|The {{property}} assessment loophole floodgates {{opened wide}} following a 1992 California Supreme Court decision (known as the Knox case) holding that Proposition 13 restrictions, particularly the two-thirds voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirement</b> for local taxes, {{did not apply}} to assessments on real property.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>clause</b> <b>establishes</b> the {{equality}} of all citizens: [...] "All citizens have equal social dignity and are equal before the law, without distinction of sex, race, language, religion, political opinions, personal and social conditions." ...|$|R
50|$|The amounts {{received}} as {{transfer of the}} broadcasting rights are not considered wages, therefore they cannot be used as basis for calculation of the penalty <b>clause</b> <b>established</b> in article 28 of Pelé Law as explained above.|$|R
50|$|Under certain circumstances, a levy {{reduction}} or repeal {{could result}} in some persons paying a higher levy amount which could constitute a tax under Proposition 26 and be deemed a tax increase for purposes of the voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirements</b> under Proposition 218.|$|R
2500|$|The voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirements</b> {{for local}} taxes under Proposition 218 are mandatory. [...] Local {{politicians}} place tax measures {{on the ballot}} for voter approval not by a voluntary choice in support of protecting local taxpayers, but rather {{in response to the}} mandates of Proposition 218.|$|R
2500|$|Title II {{consists}} of nine sections and establishes standards for external auditor independence, to limit conflicts of interest. It also addresses new auditor <b>approval</b> <b>requirements,</b> audit partner rotation, and auditor reporting requirements. [...] It restricts auditing companies from providing non-audit services (e.g., consulting) {{for the same}} clients.|$|R
2500|$|Local governments {{discovered}} a particularly pernicious {{way to raise}} additional revenues and avoid the Proposition 13 two-thirds voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirement</b> by using assessment districts. [...] Assessments on real property became the vehicle of choice for local politicians looking to avoid making hard decisions regarding general fund expenditures.|$|R
2500|$|Proposition 218 {{expressly}} {{applies to}} regional governments in California under its broad “local government” constitutional definition. [...] This means that regional governments {{must comply with}} the voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirements</b> for taxes {{as well as the}} procedures and requirements applicable to assessments and property-related fees and charges.|$|R

50|$|A local {{initiative}} under Proposition 218 {{could result}} in an inadvertent tax increase under Proposition 26 which was approved by California voters in 2010. Proposition 26 included a specific (and generally more expansive) constitutional definition of a “tax” for purposes of the voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirements</b> under Proposition 218.|$|R
50|$|Type Approval {{is not a}} term {{confined}} to a particular industry. Type <b>Approval</b> <b>requirements</b> exist for products as diverse as marine equipment, mobile phones, automotive industry, or medical equipment. Type approval simply means that the product is certified to meet certain requirements for its type, whatever that may be.|$|R
25|$|Of {{particular}} {{relevance to}} the second principle set out above, was {{the enactment of the}} Administrative Permission Law of the PRC (APL) on 27 August 2003, effective from July 2004.

50|$|The Overseas Investment Commission (OIC), {{established}} in 1973, imposed certain limitations on foreign investment. OIC consent {{was required for}} foreign investments that would control 25% or more of businesses or property worth more than NZ$10 million. Restrictions and <b>approval</b> <b>requirements</b> also applied to certain investments in land and in the commercial fishing industry.|$|R

50|$|India in 1997 allowed {{foreign direct}} {{investment}} (FDI) in cash and carry wholesale. Then, it required government <b>approval.</b> The <b>approval</b> <b>requirement</b> was relaxed, and automatic permission was granted in 2006. Between2000 to 2010, Indian retail attracted about $1.8 billion in {{foreign direct investment}}, representing a very small 1.5% of total investment flow into India.|$|R
5000|$|Proposition 39 also lowered, as {{it relates}} to school bonds, the local voter <b>approval</b> <b>{{requirement}}</b> to incur debt from a two-thirds (2/3) vote to fifty-five percent (55%). The two-thirds vote requirement to incur debt is separate from the property tax limits of Proposition 13, and had previously been part of the California Constitution since 1879.|$|R
25|$|In 1996, red tape, {{bureaucracy}} and the Licence Raj were suggested {{as a cause}} for the institutionalised corruption and inefficiency. More recent reports suggest the causes of corruption include excessive regulations and <b>approval</b> <b>requirements,</b> mandated spending programs, monopoly of certain goods and service providers by government-controlled institutions, bureaucracy with discretionary powers, and lack of transparent laws and processes.|$|R
2500|$|In 2002, a California {{appellate court}} held that an in-lieu {{franchise}} fee for water, sewer, and refuse collection services was a “property-related” fee subject to Article XIII D.

2500|$|The voter <b>approval</b> <b>requirement</b> for taxes under Proposition 218 is {{triggered}} when a {{local government}} “imposes,” “extends,” or “increases” a tax.

[...] Local tax reductions or repeals {{are not subject}} to voter approval under Section 2 of Article XIII C.|$|R
