50|$|These {{incidents}} {{have led}} to the widespread belief that the Winchester units of dry <b>capacity</b> <b>measure,</b> i.e., the bushel and its dependent quantities the peck, gallon and quart, must have originated in the time of King Edgar. However, contemporary scholarship can find no evidence for the existence of any these units in Britain prior to the Norman Conquest. Furthermore, all of the units associated with Winchester measure (quarter, bushel, peck, gallon, pottle, quart, pint) have names of French derivation, at least suggestive of Norman origin.|$|E

50|$|It can {{be proven}} that {{algebraic}} curves are complete global analytic functions, that is, {{knowledge of the}} power series expansion at one point (the so-called germ of the function) uniquely determines the function everywhere on the complex plane, except on {{a finite number of}} branch cuts. Stahl’s extremal domain theorem further asserts that there exists a maximal domain for the analytic continuation of the function, which corresponds to the choice of branch cuts with minimal logarithmic <b>capacity</b> <b>measure.</b> In the case of algebraic curves the number of cuts is finite, therefore it would be feasible to find maximal continuations by finding the combination of cuts with minimal capacity. For further improvements, Stahl’s theorem on the convergence of Padé Approximants states that the diagonal and supra-diagonal Padé (or equivalently, the continued fraction approximants to the power series) converge to the maximal analytic continuation. The zeros and poles of the approximants remarkably accumulate on the set of branch cuts having minimal capacity.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the Norman Conquest, the {{following}} units of <b>capacity</b> <b>measure</b> were used: sester, amber, mitta, coomb, and seam. A statute of 1196 (9 Richard I. c 27.) decreed: It is established that all {{measures of the}} whole of England be of the same amount, as well of corn as of vegetables and of like things, to wit, one good horse load; and that this measure be level as well in cities and boroughs as without. This {{appears to be a}} description of the seam, which would later be equated with the quarter. The word seam is of Latin derivation (from the Vulgar Latin sauma = packsaddle). Some of the other units are likewise of Latin derivation, sester from sextarius, amber from amphora. The sester could thus be taken as roughly a pint, the amber a bushel. However, the values of these units, as well as their relationships to one another, varied considerably over the centuries so that no clear definitions are possible except by specifying the time and place in which the units were used.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the outcome of}} a multidisciplinary treatment programme for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, including health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and psychosocial variables, and exercise <b>capacity</b> <b>measures.</b> DESIGN: A six-month prospective outcome study. SETTING: University outpatient rehabilitation clinic; group setting. SUBJECTS: One hundred and sixteen women fulfilling chronic fatigue syndrome criteria. INTERVENTIONS: Cognitive behaviourally and graded exercise-based strategies; emphasis on adaptive lifestyle changes. MEASURES: Short Form General Health Survey (SF- 36); Symptom Checklist (SCL- 90); Causal Attribution List (CAL); Self-Efficacy Scale (SE); maximum progressive bicycle ergometer test with respiratory gas analysis; and isokinetic leg strength test, before and after treatment. RESULTS: The total group significantly improved on nearly all reported HRQoL/psychosocial variables. Changes in exercise <b>capacity</b> <b>measures</b> were rather modest and did not correlate or only weakly correlated with HRQoL/psychosocial variables. Subgroup analyses indicated that less fit patients improved significantly more on exercise <b>capacity</b> <b>measures</b> than their more fit counterparts. Patients who were fitter at baseline scored better on pretreatment HRQoL/psychosocial variables, but both subgroups improved similarly on these variables. CONCLUSIONS: Health-related quality of life and psychosocial functioning in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome improves after a six-month cognitive behaviourally and graded exercise-based multidisciplinary treatment programme. Increase in exercise <b>capacity</b> <b>measures</b> is not a necessary condition for reported improvements, except for less fit patients. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|Nowadays, railway {{transport}} capacity {{is an important}} bottleneck for many railway operators that face its ever-increasing demand. This poses a challenge to existing lines as operation under conditions close to saturation tends be unstable. Capacity in urban railway systems depends largely on dwell times at platforms, but <b>capacity</b> <b>measures</b> proposed in literature rarely include the uncertainty associated to these times. In this paper this uncertainty is modeled as fuzzy numbers and two new <b>capacity</b> <b>measures</b> are proposed: the Fuzzy Maximum Capacity and the Fuzzy Occupancy Time Rate. The proposed model makes use of a railway simulator that enables route compression to obtain the conflict-free compressed time of the section under study.|$|R

We aimed to test the association of functional <b>capacity</b> <b>measures</b> used in current practice and molecular measures with age and health status. The cohort consisted of 178 middle-aged to old participants of the Leiden Longevity Study (range 42 – 82 years). We tested associations between functional <b>capacity</b> <b>measures</b> (physical tests: grip strength, 4 -meter walk, chair stand test; cognitive tests: Stroop test, digit symbol substitution test and 15 -picture learning test) with age and with cardiovascular or metabolic disease as a measure of the health status. These associations with age and health status were also tested for molecular measures (C reactive protein (CRP), numbers of senescent p 16 INK 4 a positive cells in the epidermis and dermis and putative immunosenescence (presence of CD 57 + T cells)). All functional <b>capacity</b> <b>measures</b> were associated with age. CRP and epidermal p 16 INK 4 a positivity were also associated with age, but with smaller estimates. Grip strength and the Stroop test were associated with cardiovascular or metabolic disease, as was epidermal p 16 INK 4 a positivity. All associations with cardiovascular or metabolic disease attenuated when adjusting for age. In conclusion, in middle-aged to old persons, the molecular measures tested here were more weakly associated with age and health status than functional <b>capacity</b> <b>measures.</b> Whether these molecular measures associate more closely with health status in the elderly or in specific groups of patients needs to be explored further...|$|R
