25|$|In the 1980s, first genital herpes {{and then}} AIDS emerged {{into the public}} {{consciousness}} as sexually transmitted diseases {{that could not be}} cured by modern medicine. AIDS in particular has a long asymptomatic period—during which time HIV (the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS) can replicate and the disease can be transmitted to others—followed by a symptomatic period, which leads rapidly to death unless treated. HIV/AIDS entered the United States from Haiti in about 1969. Recognition that AIDS threatened a global pandemic led to public information campaigns and the development of treatments that allow AIDS to be managed by suppressing the replication of HIV for as long as possible. <b>Contact</b> <b>tracing</b> continues to be an important measure, even when diseases are incurable, as it helps to contain infection.|$|E

25|$|Control of {{outbreaks}} requires coordinated medical services, {{alongside a}} certain level of community engagement. The medical services include rapid detection of cases of disease, <b>contact</b> <b>tracing</b> of those who have come into contact with infected individuals, quick access to laboratory services, proper healthcare for those who are infected, and proper disposal of the dead through cremation or burial. Samples of body fluids and tissues from people with the disease should be handled with special caution. Prevention includes limiting the spread of disease from infected animals to humans. This may be done by handling potentially infected bushmeat only while wearing protective clothing and by thoroughly cooking it before eating it. It also includes wearing proper protective clothing and washing hands when around a person with the disease. No specific treatment or vaccine for the virus is available, although a number of potential treatments are being studied. Supportive efforts, however, improve outcomes. This includes either oral rehydration therapy (drinking slightly sweetened and salty water) or giving intravenous fluids as well as treating symptoms.|$|E

40|$|An open {{question}} {{of great interest}} in biophysics is whether variations in structure cause protein folds to differ {{in the number of}} amino acid sequences that can fold to them stably, i. e., in their designability.

Here, we investigate the relationship between a fold's <b>contact</b> <b>trace</b> and its relative frequency of usage in mesophilic vs. thermophilic eubacteria. We observe that thermophilic organisms exhibit a bias toward using folds of higher <b>contact</b> <b>trace</b> when compared with mesophiles. We establish this difference both for the distributions of folds at the whole-proteome level and also through more focused structural comparisons of orthologous proteins. Our findings suggest that thermophilic adaptation in bacterial genomes occurs in part through natural selection of more designable folds, pointing to designability as a key component of protein fitness...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Contact-based {{simulations}} are a {{very popular}} tool {{for the analysis of}} opportunistic networks. They are used for evaluation of networking metrics, for quantifying the effects of infrastructure and for the design of forwarding strategies. However, little evidence exists that the results of such simulations accurately describe the performance of opportunistic networks, as they commonly ignore some important factors (like limited transmission bandwidth) or they rely on assumptions such as infinite user cache sizes. In order to evaluate this issue, we design a testbed with a real application and real users; we collect application data in addition to the <b>contact</b> <b>traces</b> and compare measured performance to the results of the contact-based simulations. We find that contact-based simulations significantly overestimate delivery ratio, while the captured delay tends to be 2 - 3 times lower than the experimentally obtained delay. We show that assuming infinite cache sizes leads to misinterpretation of the effects of backbone on an opportunistic network. Finally, we show that <b>contact</b> <b>traces</b> can be used to analytically estimate the delivery ratios and the impact of backbone, through the dependency between a user centrality measure and her delivery ratio.

Data collected from {{applications such as}} environmental monitoring, package tracking or position tracking has no meaning without knowing the location of this data. Other applications have location information as a building block for example, geographic routing protocols, data dissemination protocols and location-based services such as sensing coverage. Many of the techniques have the trade-off among many features such as deployment of special hardware, level of accuracy and computation power. In this paper, we present an algorithm that extracts location constraints from the connectivity information. Our solution, which does not require any special hardware and {{a small number of}} landmark nodes, uses two types of location constraints. The spatial constraints derive the estimated locations observing which nodes are within communication range of each other. The temporal constraints refine the areas, computed by the spatial constraints, using properties of time and space extracted from a <b>contact</b> <b>trace.</b> The intuition of the temporal constraints is to limit the possible locations that a node can be using its previous and future locations.
