25|$|In India, the 2000-year-old Kamasutra of Vātsyāyana {{speaks of}} two {{different}} kinds of ciphers called Kautiliyam and Mulavediya. In the Kautiliyam, the cipher letter substitutions are based on phonetic relations, such as vowels becoming consonants. In the Mulavediya, the <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> consists of pairing letters and using the reciprocal ones.|$|E
500|$|The {{transformation}} can {{be represented}} by aligning two alphabets; the <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> is the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions. For instance, here is a Caesar cipher using a left rotation of three places, equivalent to a right shift of 23 (the shift parameter is used as the key): ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{method of}} {{substitution}} cipher {{is based on}} a keyword. All spaces and repeated letters are removed from a word or phrase, which the encoder then uses as the start of the <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet.</b> The end of the <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> is the rest of the alphabet in order without repeating the letters in the keyword. For example, if the keyword is CIPHER, the <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> would look like this: ...|$|E
50|$|He {{published}} several <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabets</b> {{that were}} used to encrypt magic formulas.|$|R
25|$|Despite the Vigenère cipher's {{apparent}} strength {{it never}} became widely used throughout Europe. The Gronsfeld cipher is a variant created by Count Gronsfeld which {{is identical to}} the Vigenère cipher, except that it uses just 10 different <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabets</b> (corresponding to the digits 0 to 9). The Gronsfeld cipher is strengthened because its key is not a word, but it is weakened because it has just 10 <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabets.</b> Gronsfeld's <b>cipher</b> did become widely used throughout Germany and Europe, despite its weaknesses.|$|R
25|$|The first {{well-documented}} {{description of}} a polyalphabetic cipher was formulated by Leon Battista Alberti around 1467 and used a metal cipher disc to switch between <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabets.</b> Alberti's system only switched alphabets after several words, and switches were indicated by writing {{the letter of the}} corresponding alphabet in the ciphertext. Later, in 1508, Johannes Trithemius, in his work Poligraphia, invented the tabula recta, a critical component of the Vigenère cipher. The Trithemius cipher, however, only provided a progressive, rigid, and predictable system for switching between <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> of Muladeviya {{consists}} of the reciprocal one specified in the table below.|$|E
5000|$|To use the Vigenère {{square to}} encrypt a message, you first choose {{whatever}} keyword {{you want to}} use and then repeat it until it is the same length as the message you wish to encode. Let's say we use LEMON as the keyword. Each letter of the repeated keyword will tell you what cipher (what row) you'll use for each letter of the message to be coded. The <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> on the second row uses B for A and C for B etc. That would be <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> 'B'. Each <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> is named by the first letter in it. For example, if you have a keyword of LEMON and the message you want to encode is ATTACKATDAWN, this is what you would do: ...|$|E
50|$|A keyword cipher {{is a form}} of {{monoalphabetic}} substitution. A keyword is used as the key, and it {{determines the}} letter matchings of the <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> to the plain alphabet. Repeats of letters in the word are removed, then the <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> is generated with the keyword matching to A,B,C etc. until the keyword is used up, whereupon the rest of the ciphertext letters are used in alphabetical order, excluding those already used in the key.|$|E
50|$|In 1553, an {{important}} extension to Trithemius's method {{was developed by}} Giovan Battista Bellaso called the Vigenère cipher. Bellaso added a key to switch <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabets</b> every letter. This method was misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère, who published a similar autokey cipher in 1586.|$|R
50|$|In a {{polyalphabetic}} <b>cipher,</b> multiple <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabets</b> are used. To facilitate encryption, all the alphabets {{are usually}} written {{out in a}} large (information)|table, traditionally called a tableau. The tableau is usually 26×26, so that 26 full ciphertext alphabets are available. The method of filling the tableau, and of choosing which alphabet to use next, defines the particular polyalphabetic cipher. All such ciphers are easier to break than once believed, as substitution alphabets are repeated for sufficiently large plaintexts.|$|R
5|$|The {{exploratory}} {{parts of}} the game feature a series of arcane codes and glyphs, treasure maps and chests, and secret rooms. Players are left without guidance to determine whether game elements are decipherable subpuzzles or simply false signals. These sorts of puzzles include hidden warp gates, enigmatic obelisks, invisible platforms, sequences of tetrominos, a <b>ciphered</b> <b>alphabet,</b> and QR codes. One of the game's recurring themes is an ancient civilization that attempted {{to make sense of}} their dimensionality, as told through artifacts.|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} examples {{were all}} examples of monoalphabetic substitution ciphers, where just one <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> is used. It {{is also possible}} to have a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, where multiple cipher alphabets are used. The encoder would just make up two or more cipher alphabets using whatever techniques he or she chooses, and then encode their message, alternating what <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> is used with every letter or word. This makes the message much harder to decode because the codebreaker would have to figure out both cipher alphabets.|$|E
50|$|One major {{weakness}} of the Bazeries cylinder is that the offset from the plaintext letter to the ciphertext letter for the <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> on each disk will be exactly the same. In the example shown above, this offset is six letters.|$|E
5000|$|The first Code-O-Graph, {{called the}} [...] "Mystery Dial" [...] unit,was {{introduced}} in 1941, as {{a device to}} enable Secret Squadron agents {{in the field to}} send and receive secure messages. It was in badge form, as were the next three models. The front of the badge displayed the number and <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> scales. The reverse had two windows, one labeled [...] "Master Code"; the other, [...] "Super Code." [...] each window was used for cipher key settings. As an example, if the cipher was designated as [...] "Master Code 3," [...] it meant that the movable rotor was to spun so that the number 3 would appear in the window labeled [...] "Master Code." [...] This setting would align the number and <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> scales correctly to decipher a message.|$|E
5000|$|The Bazeries {{cylinder}} was {{the basis}} for the US [...] "M-94" [...] cipher machine, which was introduced in 1922 and derived from work by Parker Hitt. In 1914, Hitt had experimented with the Bazeries device, building one prototype using slides on a wooden frame, with the <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabets</b> printed twice consecutively on the slides, and then another using disks of wood. He forwarded his experiments up the Signal Corps chain of command, and in 1917 Joseph Mauborgne refined the scheme, with the final result being the M-94.|$|R
40|$|Lewis Carroll loved ciphers. Between 1858 and 1868 {{he invented}} four and {{recorded}} {{them in his}} diary: two matrix ciphers and two polyalphabetic ciphers: the Telegraph <b>Cipher</b> and the <b>Alphabet</b> <b>Cipher.</b> He submitted the latter two for publication, and personally used them to write letters to his child friends...|$|R
50|$|Polyalphabetic {{substitution}} {{with mixed}} alphabets, frequently changed without a period, {{is attributed to}} Leon Battista Alberti, who described it in his famous treatise De cifris of 1466. This crucial invention has a limit in that it obliges the encipherer to indicate, within {{the body of the}} cryptogram, the index letters determining the choice of the next alphabet.It was Giovan Battista Bellaso who first suggested identifying the alphabets by means of an agreed-upon countersign or keyword off-line. He also taught various ways of mixing the <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabets</b> in order to free the correspondents from the need to exchange disks or prescribed tables.|$|R

50|$|Codex Seraphinianus, {{originally}} published in 1981, is an illustrated encyclopedia of an imaginary world, created by the Italian artist, architect, and industrial designer Luigi Serafini during thirty months, from 1976 to 1978. The book is approximately 360 pages long (depending on edition), and written in a <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> in an imaginary language.|$|E
5000|$|The {{transformation}} can {{be represented}} by aligning two alphabets; the <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> is the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions. For instance, here is a Caesar cipher using a left rotation of three places, equivalent to a right shift of 23 (the shift parameter is used as the key): ...|$|E
50|$|The counterargument is {{that almost}} all cipher systems {{consistent}} with that era fail to match what {{is seen in the}} Voynich manuscript. For example, simple substitution ciphers would be excluded because the distribution of letter frequencies does not resemble that of any known language; while the small number of different letter shapes used implies that nomenclator and homophonic ciphers would be ruled out, because these typically employ larger <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabets.</b> Polyalphabetic <b>ciphers</b> were invented by Alberti in the 1460s and included the later Vigenère cipher, but they usually yield ciphertexts where all cipher shapes occur with roughly equal probability, quite unlike the language-like letter distribution which the Voynich Manuscript appears to have.|$|R
2500|$|What is {{now known}} as the Vigenère cipher was {{originally}} described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in his 1553 book La cifra del. Sig. Giovan Battista Bellaso. He built upon the tabula recta of Trithemius, but added a repeating [...] "countersign" [...] (a key) to switch <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabets</b> every letter. Whereas Alberti and Trithemius used a fixed pattern of substitutions, Bellaso's scheme meant the pattern of substitutions could be easily changed simply by selecting a new key. Keys were typically single words or short phrases, known to both parties in advance, or transmitted [...] "out of band" [...] along with the message. Bellaso's method thus required strong security for only the key. As it is relatively easy to secure a short key phrase, say by a previous private conversation, Bellaso's system was considerably more secure.|$|R
50|$|Zapf {{was born}} in Nuremberg during {{turbulent}} times marked by the German Revolution of 1918-1919 in Munich and Berlin, the end of World War I, the exile of Kaiser Wilhelm, {{and the establishment of}} Bavaria as a free state by Kurt Eisner. In addition, the Spanish flu pandemic took hold in Europe in 1918 and 1919. Two of Zapf's siblings died of the disease. Famine later struck Germany, and Zapf's mother was grateful to send him to school in 1925, where he received daily meals in a program organized by Herbert Hoover. In school, Zapf was mainly interested in technical subjects. One of his favorite books was the annual science journal Das neue Universum ("The New Universe"). He and his older brother experimented with electricity, building a crystal radio and an alarm system for his house. Even at this early age, Zapf was already getting involved with type, inventing <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabets</b> to exchange secret messages with his brother.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{example of}} a {{polyalphabetic}} substitution cipher that {{is much more difficult}} to decode is the Vigenère square, an innovative encoding method. With the square, there are 26 different cipher alphabets that are used to encrypt text. Each <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> is just another rightward Caesar shift of the original alphabet. This is what a Vigenère square looks like: ...|$|E
5000|$|The last Code-O-Graph was the [...] "Key-O-Matic" [...] unit. Possibly to {{compensate}} for the slippage of the 1948 unit's elements, the <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> and number scales were placed on interlocking gears, preventing any slippage. Resetting the cipher elements utilized a small key that was inserted into slots over one of the gears, which could be disengaged, using the key and a leaf spring as a simple clutch mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Beaufort's extant {{correspondence}} of 200+ {{letters and}} journals contained portions written in personal cipher. Beaufort altered the Vigenère cipher, by reversing the <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet,</b> {{and the resulting}} variant is called the Beaufort cipher. The deciphered writings have revealed family and personal problems, including some of a sexual nature. It appears that between 1835 and his marriage to Honora Edgeworth in November 1838, he had incestuous relations with his sister Harriet. His diary entries, in cypher, {{show that he was}} tortured by guilt over this.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Gromark cipher" [...] ("Gronsfeld <b>cipher</b> {{with mixed}} <b>alphabet</b> and running key") uses a running {{numerical}} key formed by adding successive pairs of digits.The VIC cipher uses a similar lagged Fibonacci generator.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{will look at}} some simple Language Modeling {{techniques}} used in attacks on primitive encryption systems. My thesis will focus on two Markov models for English. I use the simpler of these models to implement an exhaustive attack on a 2 x 2 Hill Cipher. The number of keys in an n x n Hill <b>Cipher</b> over the <b>alphabet</b> of integers modulo k is calculated using the Chinese Remainder Theorem...|$|R
5000|$|The Vigenère <b>cipher</b> {{with normal}} <b>alphabets</b> {{essentially}} uses modulo arithmetic, which is commutative. So if the key length is known (or guessed) then subtracting the cipher text from itself, {{offset by the}} key length, will produce the plain text encrypted with itself. If any [...] "probable word" [...] in the plain text is known or can be guessed, then its self-encryption can be recognized, allowing recovery of the key by subtracting the known plaintext from the cipher text. Key elimination is especially useful against short messages.|$|R
5000|$|The cipher disk {{can be used}} in one of two ways. The code can be a {{consistent}} monoalphabetic substitution for the entire cipher or the disks can be moved periodically throughout the cipher making it polyalphabetic. For a monoalphabetic use, the sender and the person receiving the messages would agree on a cipher key setting (e.g., the [...] "G" [...] in the regular alphabet would be positioned next to the [...] "Q" [...] in the <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet).</b> The entire message is then encoded according to this key.|$|E
50|$|Substitution {{of single}} letters separately—simple substitution—can be {{demonstrated}} by writing out the alphabet in some order {{to represent the}} substitution. This is termed a substitution alphabet. The <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> may be shifted or reversed (creating the Caesar and Atbash ciphers, respectively) or scrambled in a more complex fashion, in which case it is called a mixed alphabet or deranged alphabet. Traditionally, mixed alphabets may be created by first writing out a keyword, removing repeated letters in it, then writing all the remaining letters in the alphabet in the usual order.|$|E
5000|$|The 1948 model, the [...] "Mirro-Magic" [...] unit, was a {{circular}} product, manufactured of brass, aluminum, plastic, and steel. The cipher letters and numbers {{could only be}} seen {{one at a time}} through windows on the front. The design had the <b>cipher</b> <b>alphabet</b> and number disks coupled by friction, and there was often slippage when trying to decipher a message. Unlike any other Code-O-Graph, the cipher-key settings utilized a pointer on the back, and a number scale from 1 through 26. Each would increment the positioning of the two scales.|$|E
50|$|Basically, the Interlac {{alphabet}} is {{a simple}} one-to-one substitution <b>cipher.</b> The Interlac <b>alphabet</b> corresponds perfectly to the twenty-six letters of the Latin alphabet and the numbering system corresponds to Earth Base-Ten form. Although nominally protected by differences in font spacing, the numbering system itself suffers from a minor stylistic flaw due to the potential for confusion of 6 with 41 and 7 with 42. Anyone writing it by hand could certainly introduce an error when read by another, and this could create problems with handwriting recognition, as well.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Berbain, Gilbert, and Patarin {{presented}} QUAD, a {{pseudo random}} number generator (PRNG) at Eurocrypt 2006. QUAD (as PRNG and stream cipher) may be proved secure based on an interesting hardness assumption about the one-wayness of multivariate quadratic polynomial systems over F 2. The original BGP proof only worked for F 2 and left a gap to general Fq. We show that {{the result can be}} generalized to any arbitrary finite field Fq, and thus produces a stream <b>cipher</b> with <b>alphabets</b> in Fq. Further, we generalize the underlying hardness assumption to specialized systems in Fq (including F 2) that can be evaluated more efficiently. Barring breakthroughs in the current state-of-the-art for system-solving, a rough implementation of a provably secure instance of our new PRNG is twice as fast and takes 1 / 10 the storage of an instance of QUAD with the same level of provable security. Recent results on specialization on security are also examined. And we conclude that our ideas are consistent with these new developments and complement them. This gives a clue that we may build secure primitives based on specialized polynomial maps which are more efficient...|$|R
25|$|Essentially all ciphers {{remained}} {{vulnerable to}} cryptanalysis using the frequency analysis technique until {{the development of}} the polyalphabetic cipher, most clearly by Leon Battista Alberti around the year 1467, though there is some indication that it was already known to Al-Kindi. Alberti's innovation was to use different <b>ciphers</b> (i.e., substitution <b>alphabets)</b> for various parts of a message (perhaps for each successive plaintext letter at the limit). He also invented what was probably the first automatic cipher device, a wheel which implemented a partial realization of his invention. In the polyalphabetic Vigenère cipher, encryption uses a key word, which controls letter substitution depending on which letter of the key word is used. In the mid-19th century Charles Babbage showed that the Vigenère cipher was vulnerable to Kasiski examination, but this was first published about ten years later by Friedrich Kasiski.|$|R
