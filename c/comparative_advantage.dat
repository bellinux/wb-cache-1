5|$|If we {{want more}} fish, we should shift that person who has a <b>comparative</b> <b>advantage</b> in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut {{gathering}} and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, {{the slope of the}} joint PPF is -2. If we want to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.|$|E

It represents {{an alternative to the}} traditional approach of Bella Balassa, Thomas Vollrath and others. The innovativeness of the overall revealed <b>comparative</b> <b>advantages</b> approach preconditions a certain prudence with regard to its use and interpretation. It is necessary to explore the potential of the approach in different conditions and different circumstances. It was found that the approach of overall revealed <b>comparative</b> <b>advantages</b> is resistant to the Euclidean distances and commodity classifications used for metrification. It has the potential to synthesize uniformly divergent changes in specialization by country and commodity groups and is a useful tool for the analysis of <b>comparative</b> <b>advantages...</b>|$|R

During the 1950s, output of beef and grain fell, and the economy suffered. The policy shift toward agricultural production created a gap in income distribution, as {{the majority of those}} who worked in agriculture laboured on tiny plots, while the majority of the land was in large estates.

This way the statement of real assumptions inside economics can be assured, connected to processes developed in an extended economic time and space. From this perspective <b>comparative</b> <b>advantage’s</b> analysis is necessary due to the existence of the tendency in which once with some new instruments’ creations, usually more formal and using a mathematical instrument more sophisticated, the validity of <b>comparative</b> <b>advantage’s</b> classic principle would be denied. The idea of introducing the validity of the <b>comparative</b> <b>advantage’s</b> principle in the trade exchanges – considered by Samuelson versus Stanislaw Ulam an accepted truth by all economists (and not only) as being un undemonstrated one – is not a productive one from an analytical point of view, which could contribute to the economics’ development. ...|$|R

We analyze <b>comparative</b> <b>advantages</b> of Hungarian, Croatian and Slovenian agro-food {{trade in}} the European Union (EU). The {{empirical}} research seeks to explain how revealed <b>comparative</b> <b>advantages</b> have developed across countries, main product groups and over time and what are likely their implications for multifunctional rural development in the enlarged EU. We employ a disaggregated trade dataset to identify the revealed <b>comparative</b> <b>advantages</b> to provide broader policy implications. The empirical results confirmed bulk of agro-food and forestry products with revealed <b>comparative</b> <b>advantages</b> in the EU markets for Hungary {{and to a lesser}} extent for Croatia, but have not identified any such aggregated agro-food product group for Slovenia. Yet, also Hungary and Croatia have faced difficulties in <b>comparative</b> trade <b>advantages</b> in consumer-ready foods and processed intermediaries. Agro-food sectors in Hungary are likely to continue to have a significant role in the Hungarian {{and to a lesser extent}} in Croatian rural areas, but employment and income activities are more likely to be combined with other more rapidly growing service activities.

Bank branches are points of sale whose trade environment influences their activities and performance. <b>Comparative</b> <b>advantages</b> are defined, for each output mix, by the strict dominance of a production technology in a specific trade area over the production technologies of other environments. Using Shephard's output distance functions on a sample of 728 bank branches, we compare the production technologies for different output mixes and different trade environments. We show that none of the production technologies strictly dominates the others and none of them is strictly dominated. Therefore, each trade area benefits from <b>comparative</b> <b>advantages</b> that we try to highlight. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the central banks regarding their ability to provide the right incentives on output mixes to their bank branches so that the latter may benefit from their <b>comparative</b> <b>advantages...</b>|$|R

25|$|Prior to Krugman's work, trade theory (see David Ricardo and Heckscher–Ohlin model) {{emphasized}} trade {{based on}} the <b>comparative</b> <b>advantage</b> of countries with very different characteristics, such as {{a country with a}} high agricultural productivity trading agricultural products for industrial products from a country with a high industrial productivity. However, in the 20th century, an ever-larger share of trade occurred between countries with similar characteristics, which is difficult to explain by <b>comparative</b> <b>advantage.</b> Krugman's explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the Journal of International Economics, and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors economies of scale. Consumers' preference for diversity explains the survival of different versions of cars like Volvo and BMW. However, because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of Volvos all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or maybe just one). This logic explains how each country may specialize in producing a few brands of any given type of product, instead of specializing in different types of products.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, the {{outsourcing}} of labour to Asia, Latin America, and Africa {{has been}} partially driven by increasing costs of union partnership, which gives other countries a <b>comparative</b> <b>advantage</b> in labour, {{making it more}} profitable to purchase disorganized, low-wage labour from these regions.
