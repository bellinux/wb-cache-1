25|$|This first type, usually {{known as}} the First small cross or Reform type, {{remained}} in currency for Edgar’s last years, the whole of Edward the Martyr’s short reign and even into {{the first years of}} Æthelred II, who came to the throne in 978/9. At some point early in his reign, however, another of the features that was to characterise the late Anglo-Saxon currency system came into play: the first of many changes of type. More than fifty such changes occurred during the existence of the coinage as reformed by Edgar, which persisted until the 1150s. Within the reign of Æthelred, for instance, six such changes can be seen, manifested in the progression of the following types: First Small cross; First hand; Second hand; Crux; Long Cross; Helmet; Last Small cross. After the death of Cnut, under whom another three types (Quatrefoil, Helmet and Short cross) were struck, types become more numerous and changes presumably more frequent: fourteen types were struck in the years between 1035 and the Norman Conquest of 1066, probably lasting only two or three years each. It is presumed that each <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> required coins of old money to be exchanged for new, with the king and the moneyer taking a cut either as a portion {{of the value of the}} new coins or from the minting process. The weight of the coinage varied considerably, even within types, suggesting that there may have been some profit taken in minting by extracting silver from the coinage, though within the kingdom of England it would have been possible to enforce that all coins be accepted at face value regardless of weight. Hoard evidence, at least from before the 1030s, suggests that reminting of the whole coinage was stipulated at each <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>type,</b> for a number of hoards survive consisting of only one type. Alongside these, however, are ‘savings’ hoards, which contain a mixture of two or more types; and a mixture of types becomes much more common in hoards from after the 1030s. One possible explanation for this change in the pattern of production and hoarding is that it came to be the rule, after the 1030s, that only payments to the crown had to be in the current type, whereas other types of English coinage were viable for other purposes.|$|E
25|$|Numismatists have {{sometimes}} tried to discern a very rigid system of organisation {{in the late}} Anglo-Saxon coinage: one, Michael Dolley, believed that until the death of Cnut in 1035, each type lasted six years, {{with a few exceptions}} – such as the Last Small Cross type at the end of Æthelred’s reign – lasting longer under very unusual conditions. Some features seem to support this belief, at least for the earlier period. Certain changes of type apparently coincided with datable historic events: no coins of the Helmet type survive from the mint of Wilton, for instance, whereas no coins of the preceding Long Cross type are known from nearby Salisbury, but moneyers with the same names as those from Wilton started to operate there in the Helmet type. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 1003 Wilton was sacked by Vikings and the inhabitants retreated to Salisbury, and {{it is likely that the}} <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> coincided with this event. However, there are a number of difficulties with reconstructing such a fixed framework. Not all types are as well represented in the surviving material, and it is clear that this is not always simply a result of a few large hoards distorting our view. There are a number of very small and rare types which were certainly never meant to become fully fledged issues, though some bear a clear relationship to them. Examples from the reign of Æthelred II include the Benediction Hand type and the Intermediate Small Cross type, as well as the famous Agnus Dei type: a unique and fascinating issue on which the king’s portrait and the reverse cross are replaced with, respectively, the Lamb of God and the Holy Dove. The exact context for the production of this very rare coinage is unclear (eighteen specimens survive, as of November 2008): it was only struck at smaller mints, mostly in the midlands, either as an abortive main issue or as a special religious coinage for some specific purpose or occasion. Although the dating is unclear, it may be associated with the Eynsham gathering and the Penitential Edict of 1009. But the difficulties with the sexennial theory are not restricted to smaller, rarer types. The Second Hand type of Æthelred, for example, was not much different in appearance from its predecessor, raising the question of how easily people would have told it and the old coinage apart. More importantly, only minuscule numbers of the type survive from more northerly mints such as Lincoln and York which, in the rest of the period, were some of the most productive in the kingdom. It is possible that the Second Hand type represents a continuation of the First Hand type, which may have run on rather longer than six years as part of a mechanism that did envisage changes of type, but not necessarily on a strict sexennial basis.|$|E

In the sham election of to-day, which the politicians claim gives them a mandate to muddle up our affairs, the voter puts a x against {{the name of the}} least detestable of the two candidates that are thrust upon him. Under the Proportional Representation method there will be a larger constituency, a larger list of candidates, and a larger number of people to be elected, and he will put I against the name of the man he most wants to be elected, 2 against his second choice, and if he likes he may indulge in marking a third, or even a further choice. He may, if he thinks fit, number off the whole list of candidates. That is all he will have to do. That is the stupendous intricacy of the method that flattens out the minds of Lord Harcourt and Sir Thomas Whittaker. And as for the working of it, if you must go into that, all that happens is that if your first choice gets more votes than he needs for his return, he takes only the fraction of your vote that he requires, {{and the rest of the}} vote goes on to your Number 2. If 2 isn't in need of all of it, the rest goes on to 3. And so on.

60|$|The {{frequent}} {{recurrence of}} periods {{of high and}} of low excentricity must certainly have produced changes of climate of considerable importance {{to the life of}} animals and plants. During periods of high excentricity with summer in perihelion, that season would be certainly very much hotter, while the winters would be longer and colder than at present; and although geographical conditions might prevent any permanent increase of snow and ice even in the extreme north, yet we cannot doubt that the whole northern hemisphere would then have a very different climate than when the changing phase of precession brought a very cool summer and a very mild winter--a perpetual spring, in fact. Now, such a change of climate would certainly be calculated to bring about a considerable change of species, both by modification and migration, without any such decided <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> either in the vegetation or the animals that we could say from their fossil remains that any change of climate had taken place. Let us suppose, for instance, that the climate of England and that of Canada were to be mutually exchanged, and that the change took five or six thousand years to bring about, it cannot be doubted that considerable modifications in the fauna and flora of both countries would be the result, although it is impossible to predict {120} what the precise changes would be. We can safely say, however, that some species would stand the change better than others, while it is highly probable that some would be actually benefited by it, and that others would be injured. But the benefited would certainly increase, and the injured decrease, in consequence, and thus a series of changes would be initiated that might lead to most important results. Again, we are sure that some species would become modified in adaptation to the change of climate more readily than others, and these modified species would therefore increase {{at the expense of others}} not so readily modified; and hence would arise on the one hand extinction of species, and on the other the production of new forms.|$|E

This algebra was revealed in a course of matrix researches of structures of the genetic code and it was described in the author's articles arXiv: 0803. 3330 and arXiv: 0805. 4692. The article presents data about many kinds of cyclic permutations of elements of the genetic code in the genetic (8 x 8) -matrix [C A; U G](3) of 64 triplets, where C, A, U, G are letters of the genetic alphabet. These cyclic permutations lead to such reorganizations of the matrix form of presentation of the initial genetic Yin-Yang-algebra that arisen matrices serve as matrix forms of presentations of new Yin-Yang-algebras as well. They are connected algorithmically with Hadamard matrices. The discovered existence of a hierarchy <b>of</b> the cyclic <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> genetic Yin-Yang-algebras allows thinking about new algebraic-genetic models of cyclic processes in inherited biological systems including models of cyclic metamorphoses of animals. These cycles <b>of</b> <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> the genetic 8 -dimensional algebras and of their 8 -dimensional numeric systems have many analogies with famous facts and doctrines of modern and ancient physiology, medicine, etc. This viewpoint proposes that the famous idea by Pythagoras (about organization of natural systems in accordance with harmony of numerical systems) should be combined with the idea <b>of</b> cyclic <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> Yin-Yang-numeric systems in considered cases.

50|$|Exactly when Edgar {{reformed}} the coinage is not certain: {{that it was}} {{towards the}} end of his reign is clear from the coins, and the only help provided by written sources is a reference in Roger of Wendover’s 13th-century chronicle, which implies the reform may have taken place in or after 973. Its impact, however, cannot be underestimated, and it formed the basis of the English coinage until the reign of Henry II. Old coins disappeared from circulation and a single standardised type was introduced at around forty mints across the country, bearing the royal portrait and title on the obverse and the names of moneyer and mint around a small central cross on the reverse. Initially, too, all new dies were distributed from a single die-cutting centre located at Winchester. Such centralisation was unusual, and occurred in {{only a few of the}} other types that came after: more commonly, the same type was used throughout the country but die production devolved to a number of regional die-cutting centres which distributed dies to nearby, smaller mints. Even within the nine-month reign of Harold II in 1066 coins were struck with a new design in his name at forty-eight mints. Around seventy places in England (and in Wales under the Normans) were active as mints during this period, ranging hugely in size and productivity: the largest was London, though York and Lincoln remained important throughout the period, and other major mints included Winchester, Norwich and Stamford. At the other end of the scale are places that were never important mints in the Anglo-Saxon period and are little more than villages, hillforts and market towns today, including Melton Mowbray, Milborne Port, Castle Gotha, Cadbury Castle and Dunwich. Mints of this kind were often only active during short periods, such as a number of 'emergency' mints set up during the reign of Æthelred II because of Viking depredations.The designs chosen for the coinage were relatively uniform, following the pattern of Edgar’s reformed pennies: the obverse carried some form of royal portrait as well as the royal name and title, whilst the reverse gave the name of the moneyer and the mint around some form of cross. Within this format, however, there was much variation. Portraits could face either way and reflect a wide range of influences. Under Æthelred II, for instance, one type was based upon early 4th-century Roman coins showing the emperor in military garb, with helmet and armour; another was based on civilian portraits of other 4th-century emperors without any form of headgear. Under Edward the Confessor there was strong German influence in the portraits from the last fifteen years or so of his reign, perhaps as a result of Edward’s employment of German goldsmiths named Theoderic and Otto. These show the king bearded, helmeted and crowned, and in some cases even facing straight forward or seated on a throne. The existence of moneyer and mint names on each and every coin provide valuable evidence for the study of not only mint structure (in terms of how productive certain moneyers were, or how many shared dies) but also of contemporary naming patterns and - to some extent - the makeup of the population. Mints located in the old Danelaw, like York and Lincoln, contained a preponderance of moneyers with Scandinavian names, whilst one sometimes comes across moneyers all over the country with continental names, or even more exotic names in Old Irish. This first type, usually known as the First small cross or Reform type, remained in currency for Edgar’s last years, the whole of Edward the Martyr’s short reign and even into the first years of Æthelred II, who came to the throne in 978/9. At some point early in his reign, however, another of the features that was to characterise the late Anglo-Saxon currency system came into play: the first of many changes of type. More than fifty such changes occurred during the existence of the coinage as reformed by Edgar, which persisted until the 1150s.

50|$|Remarkably little written {{evidence}} survives to help numismatists and historians {{understand how the}} coinage and its system of changes of type actually functioned. Domesday Book does record that moneyers at certain mints {{had to go to}} London to purchase new dies for twenty shillings quando moneta vertebatur (‘when the coinage was changed’), and that certain towns paid annual sums to the king for the privilege of running a mint. At several towns bishops and abbots had rights to the profits of one or more moneyers (which normally went to the king), but these are no longer reflected by any changes {{in the design of the}} coins. Numismatists have sometimes tried to discern a very rigid system of organisation in the late Anglo-Saxon coinage: one, Michael Dolley, believed that until the death of Cnut in 1035, each type lasted six years, with a few exceptions - such as the Last Small Cross type at the end of Æthelred’s reign - lasting longer under very unusual conditions.

The structure stiffness <b>change</b> <b>of</b> cup <b>type</b> transmission tower was simulated innovatively and found its nonuniformity. The result shows that the structural stiffness uniformly changes along the height when the flow direction parallel to the cross arm while the stiffness of crank arm and cross arm has mutations when the flow direction is vertical to the cross arm. Horizontal stiffness change causes a significant <b>change</b> <b>of</b> wind vibration coefficient. A simulation analysis was performed about wind-induced response of cup-tower to obtain the <b>change</b> rule <b>of</b> wind vibration coefficient. Furthermore, proposed the approximate calculation formula of wind vibra-tion coefficient at crank arm and cross arm...|$|R
