25|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{organization of}} securities trading in New York among brokers directly dealing {{with each other}} {{can be traced to}} the Buttonwood Agreement. Previously securities exchange had been intermediated by the auctioneers who also conducted more mundane auctions of commodities such as wheat and tobacco. On May 17, 1792 twenty four brokers signed the Buttonwood Agreement which set a floor <b>commission</b> <b>rate</b> charged to clients and bound the signers to give preference to the other signers in securities sales. The earliest securities traded were mostly governmental securities such as War Bonds from the Revolutionary War and First Bank of the United States stock, although Bank of New York stock was a non-governmental security traded in the early days. The Bank of North America along with the First Bank of the United States and the Bank of New York were the first shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange.|$|E
2500|$|Statistical studies {{over several}} {{recent years and}} large populations of {{institutional}} trade data have revealed {{that the cost of}} executing and clearing institutional trades is between 1.25 and 1.65 cents per share. Most institutional advisors pay between 3 and 5 cents per share commissions to their brokers. Many of these institutional fiduciaries provide no disclosure of what [...] "services" [...] they are receiving for the excess over their fully negotiated <b>commission</b> <b>rate.</b> In bundled full service brokerage arrangements this lack of disclosure is particularly problematic because it makes it difficult to apply Section 28(e) tests and measure Section 28(e) compliance.|$|E
40|$|For this Report, the Research Working Group {{reviewed}} {{evidence on}} disproportionality in Washington’s {{criminal justice system}} and considered whether crime <b>commission</b> <b>rates</b> accounted for this disproportionality. They found that crime <b>commission</b> <b>rates</b> by race and ethnicity are largely unknown and perhaps unknowable, but that some researchers simply take arrest rates as good proxies for underlying <b>commission</b> <b>rates</b> for all crimes. They found that use of arrest rates likely overstates black crime <b>commission</b> <b>rates</b> for several reasons. But even if arrest rates are used {{as a proxy for}} underlying crime <b>commission</b> <b>rates,</b> the extent of racial disproportionality is not explained by <b>commission</b> <b>rates.</b> In 1982, 80 % of black imprisonment in Washington for serious crimes could not be accounted for based on arrest rates, though by 2009, this had dropped to 45 %. Part II presents the Working Group’s findings and data regarding racial disproportionality within Washington State’s criminal justice system. Part III discusses three possible causes for this disproportionality. Part III. A discusses differential <b>commission</b> <b>rates,</b> concluding that this factor alone cannot account for the disproportionality observed in the criminal justice system. Part III. B discusses seven racially neutral policies that have racially disparate effects, and thus help explain racial disproportionality. Finally, Part III. C discusses bias, whether explicit or implicit, and how it produces racial disparity...|$|R

2500|$|An {{example of}} illegal use of {{undisclosed}} soft dollars might be when {{a mutual fund}} manager pays commissions to a broker-dealer and in return the broker-dealer provides furniture for the fund adviser's use. [...] Likewise, the adviser to a registered mutual fund cannot send brokerage to a wire-house for providing [...] "shelf space" [...] and marketing favoritism for the family of funds. Such brokerage arrangements, where favors are traded in exchange for institutional clients' excess commissions have been criticized by securities regulators. Full-service brokerage bundled commission arrangements involving the exchange of brokerage firms' undisclosed proprietary services provided for institutional clients' brokerage commissions (paid in excess of a fully negotiated execution-only <b>commission</b> <b>rate)</b> can create conflicts of interest. The lack of transparency in these full-service brokerage arrangements may shield abuses from immediate detection.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the U.S. {{government}} investigated the brokerage industry's pricing practices. They concluded {{the industry was}} engaged in price fixing. The government told the brokerage industry that, as of May 1, 1975 it {{would be required to}} [...] "fully negotiate" [...] brokerage commissions with each client for each trade. As the May 1, 1975 deadline approached the brokerage industry went through several changes in an attempt to restructure itself so it could offer services and negotiate the price of each service separately. In the industry this process was known as [...] "unbundling" [...] and it created the discount-brokerage segment of the industry. At the same time, the brokerage industry lobbied Congress to allow it to continue to include the cost of investment research given to institutional clients as part of the fully negotiated commission. Shortly after May 1, 1975 Congress passed an amendment to Section 28 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Section 28(e) provides a [...] "safe harbor" [...] for any fiduciary that [...] "pays up" [...] from its fully negotiated <b>commission</b> <b>rate</b> to receive qualifying research or brokerage services from its broker(s).|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} an empirical {{investigation of a}} multiple principal-multiple agent relationship under changing industry conditions. Using thirty-four years of biannual data, it investigates the relationship between property-casualty insurers and agents representing multiple insurers. Several facts emerge. Average <b>commission</b> <b>rates</b> {{and the number of}} insurers represented are lower when insurers have higher profitability. Agency income is not systematically related to insurer profitability. Competition from alternative distribution systems and technological innovation have reduced <b>commission</b> <b>rates.</b> Larger agencies have lower average <b>commission</b> <b>rates.</b> These facts are interpreted in light of industry history and economic theory and suggest areas for further research.

50|$|The {{worldwide}} <b>commission</b> <b>rate</b> {{for advertising}} agencies is fixed at 15% {{of the total}} billing. This is {{the only source of}} income they earn from media.

Agencies are demanding to increase the <b>commission</b> <b>rate</b> but clients are not even willing to give the 15% even though it's the only source of revenue for the Agency. There are cases that agencies are forced to lower their rates to the level of 5% to 10% due to competition. So in some cases there are agencies that are not even getting the fixed 15%.|$|E
