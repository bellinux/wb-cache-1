While easy to state, the problem does not have a simple answer. We provide a solution by starting from membrane systems with one membrane, and introducing the “reverse P systems”.

40|$|Teaching {{physical}} motions such as riding, exercising, swimming, etc. {{to human}} beings is hard. Coaches face difficulties in communicating their feedback verbally and cannot correct the student mid-action; teaching videos are two dimensional and suffer from perspective distortion. Systems that track a user and provide him real-time feedback have many potential applications: {{as an aid to}} the visually challenged, improving rehabilitation, improving exercise routines such as weight training or yoga, teaching new motion tasks, synchronizing motions of multiple actors, etc. It is not easy to deliver real-time feedback {{in a way that is}} easy to interpret, yet unobtrusive enough to not distract the user from the motion task. I have developed motion feedback systems that provide real-time feedback to achieve or improve human motion tasks. These systems track the user’s actions with simple sensors, and use tiny vibration motors as feedback devices. Vibration motors provide feedback that is both intuitive and minimally intrusive. My systems ’ designs are simple, flexible, and extensible to large-scale, full-body motion tasks. The systems that I developed as part of this thesis address two classes of motion tasks: configu-ration tasks and trajectory tasks.

40|$|Traugott and Dasher (2002) draw our {{attention}} to items at the extreme right of the spectrum of semantic change where the canonical or core meaning is almost entirely bleached. Lexicographers and semanticists have struggled to pin down the senses of such items, {{often referred to as}} discourse or pragmatic markers (see, however, Dostie, 2004; Hansen, 1998 a). Pragmatic markers are often multifunctional, serving both turn-taking and modal functions or, {{as in the case of}} quand même, the focus of this study, both an adversative and a relational function. Traugott and Dasher suggest that the frequency of certain contextual interpretations of an item can end up by eclipsing the original sense. The original sense may continue in a state of polysemy with the new sense or may entirely disappear – this is summed up in the <b>configuration</b> <b>M</b> 1 > M 1 /M 2 (> M 2). This chapter explores the potential of parallel corpora as a means of demonstrating that semantic change has indeed occurred. Translators translate according to the context – and their translation may capture in the target language the nuances of the item as its senses evolve. The translation of such items is far from unproblematic (see Aijmer, Foolen and Simon-Vandenbergen, 2006, and Aijmer, 2007). However, if M 1 and M 2 are encoded in different expressions in the TL and translators select M 2 rather than M 1, this may prove to be a sound test for semantic change...|$|E
40|$|We {{construct}} a simple statistical model {{in order to}} estimate, for very energetic collisions, the ratios of particles with various quantum numbers produced with center-of-mass momenta less than a few GeV. Two conclusions are that (1) isobar decay can account for a large fraction of the SU(3) vio-lation observed experimentally, and (2) at high transverse momentum the dominance of pions diminishes. (Submitted to The Physical Review, Comments and Addenda.) * Supported by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission. - 2 -In this paper we {{construct a}}n extremely simple statistical picture of hadron production in the central region of rapidity. It illustrates how several features of the produced particle spectrum in hadron collisions can be understood without resorting to sophisticated dynamical models. While we are not sure {{whether this is a}} model which can be used for serious quantitative study, we do believe it contains qualitative features of some generality. The principal feature of the model is its simplemindedness. Imagine {{that as a result of}} the high energy collision, the interaction region is a chaotic reservoir of partons: quarks and antiquarks. A. quark leaving the zone of interaction must pick up at least one neighbor parton from the reservoir in order to make a hadron. Assuming there are equal numbers of quarks and antiquarks of each variety in the reservoir, there is a 50 % chance that the q grabs a 4. We assume that at this point the qi system is satisfied and departs for infinity as a meson M. In the other half of the cases the qq system must grab again, and there is again a 50 % chance of satisfaction, now as a qqq baryon state B. Proceeding thus, we have the configurations listed below <b>Configuration</b> <b>M</b> or B Probability ss M l/...|$|E
