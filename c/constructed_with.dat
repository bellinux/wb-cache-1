40|$|Fluorescence {{resonance}} energy transfer (FRET) measurement based on partial acceptor photobleaching (PbFRET) {{is easy to}} implement without external references. However, the current PbFRET methods are inapplicable to the <b>construct</b> <b>with</b> multiple acceptors, which largely increase the Förster distance. Here, we proposed a linear theory for the dependence of the acceptor photobleaching probability of <b>construct</b> <b>with</b> multiple acceptors on the photobleaching degree (x) and developed a multiple acceptors PbFRET method (Ma-PbFRET) to measure the FRET efficiency of <b>construct</b> <b>with</b> multiple acceptors (n) by measuring the fluorescence intensities of both donor and acceptor channels before and after acceptor photobleaching. The Ma-PbFRET method was validated by measuring the FRET efficiency of <b>construct</b> <b>with</b> two or three acceptors under different x in living cells. Our experimental results demonstrate that the Ma-PbFRET method is capable of exactly quantifying the FRET efficiency of <b>construct</b> <b>with</b> multiple acceptors, providing a simple and powerful tool to investigate the assembly/disassembly of biomolecular complexes with larger distance in living cells...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} {{the expression of the}} bacterial gene chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) {{under the control of the}} Drosophila rDNA promoter following transfection into Drosophila tissue culture cells. Constructs having an entire NTS, corresponding to approximately 3640 base pairs of upstream rDNA sequence, or <b>constructs</b> <b>with</b> 306 base pairs of upstream sequence respectively, are transcribed at 5 fold or 2 fold higher levels than a <b>construct</b> <b>with</b> 43 base pairs of upstream DNA. In co-transfection experiments, the <b>construct</b> <b>with</b> the entire NTS competes for transcription 20 fold more effectively than the <b>construct</b> <b>with</b> 306 base pairs of upstream sequence. Constructs having either 72 base pairs or 60 base pairs of upstream rDNA sequences, on the other hand, are transcribed very much less efficiently than <b>constructs</b> <b>with</b> either 306 bp or with only 43 bp of upstream DNA. These sequences, which reduce levels of rDNA transcription in the absence of additional upstream DNA, lie in a region in which the rDNA promoter differs from its duplications within the NTS...|$|R

40|$|T-antigen-induced DNA {{distortion}} was {{studied in}} a series of simian virus 40 (SV 40) plasmid constructs whose relative replication efficiency ranges from 0. 2 to 36. Bending was detected in the wild-type SV 40 regulatory region consisting of three copies of the GC-rich 21 -bp repeat but not in <b>constructs</b> <b>with</b> only one or two copies of the 21 -bp repeat. In a <b>construct</b> <b>with</b> enhanced replication efficiency, bending occurred in a 69 -bp cellular sequence located upstream of a single copy of the 21 -bp repeat. Bending occurred both upstream of ori and in the three 21 -bp repeats located downstream of ori in a <b>construct</b> <b>with</b> reduced replication efficiency. In a <b>construct</b> <b>with</b> no 21 -bp repeats, DNA distortion occurred downstream of ori. The results indicate that SV 40 DNA replication is enhanced when the structure of the regulatory region allows the DNA to form a bent structure upstream of the initial movement of the replication fork...|$|R

The ships were good sea boats, but they rolled badly and the sponsons for the main guns caused severe vibration. Since Geier was laid down after the other five ships entered service, she was redesigned slightly to discard the sponsons, and so she did not suffer from bad vibration. They were very maneuverable, except for turns into the wind when steaming at low speed. The ships had a crew of 9officers and 152enlisted men. They carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one cutter, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
