Ghetti copied the figure of St. Peter at lower right from Granacci’s Madonna and Child with Sts.

5000|$|The Japanese {{were also}} looking for new designs, notably those using inline engines, where they had little experience.

40|$|Construction {{techniques}} for large space structures are discussed.

A space fabrication machine containing reels of flat sheet material and sets of rollers or dies is described, as is a machine for fabricating composite material (which must be heated for forming and then cooled to achieve structural strength). The use of fabrication machines to build such structures as space platforms, microwave radiometers, and satellite power systems is discussed. The versatility of the machine when operated in conjunction with the Space Shuttle and a <b>set</b> of <b>jigs</b> is illustrated by showing how large square solar panels and large hexagonal structures could be constructed.

We test the model using a range of synthetic <b>canopy</b> data <b>sets</b> generated using several canopy simulation models realized for different micrometeorological and vegetation conditions. The method appears promising for filling large systematic gaps providing the associated missing data do not overerode critical information content in the conditioning data used for the model optimization...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to design, analyze and manufacture a carbon fiber bicycle stem that maximizes the use of carbon fiber composites. The stem is the part of the bicycle that connects the handlebar to the fork. The design is difficult due to the small size and complex geometry of the part, thus not obvious to conceive with a standard composite manufacturing approach. With all the required specifications and the experience of the early prototypes, a general manufacturing plan was devised. Work began with a concurrent design and analysis process. The machining and preparation of the prototyping molds followed. After a limited production of prototypes, a <b>set</b> of <b>jigs</b> was designed to perform the post-machining operations and a series of tests was run to detect any possible flaws in the design. The resulting design was successful in terms of weight, stiffness, strength and aesthetic properties.
