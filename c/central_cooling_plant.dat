40|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{focusing}} on optimal control of HVAC systems. Various optimal control methods were developed by researchers. However, the uncertainties in the optimal control strategies were rarely considered. The uncertainties commonly exist in the measurements of real plants. These measurement uncertainties impact the outputs of optimal control strategies. As a result, the risk of implementing the optimal control strategies in real systems should be analyzed. This article presents a method for analyzing the impacts of measurement uncertainties on control strategies. The method is used to evaluate control strategies for a typical cooling water system. Results show that the method applied in the uncertainty analysis is effective in estimating the uncertainty propagation in control strategies. Furthermore, energy wastes of a <b>central</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>plant</b> resulting from measurement uncertainties in different seasons using different control strategies are estimated.

40|$|The use {{of natural}} gas cooling {{equipment}} such as engine-driven chillers for air conditioning commercial buildings is known to provide operating cost savings over conventional electric chillers in many regions of the country. To be an economically viable alternative, business managers normally require that the actual savings from using gas cooling must be sufficient {{to pay back the}} higer firstcost premium of gas chillers in a time period usualy not exeeding three years. Simple payback analysis, alone, does not provide the financial information necessary to make optimal long term investment decisions for <b>central</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>plant</b> improvements. To provide a complete picture of alternative investments, simple payback results can be effectively used in conjunction with other financial criteria such as return on investment, internal rate of return, and net present value.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} a multi-agent control approach for supervisory control of large <b>central</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>plants.</b> Â The starting point for this work was a multi-agent control simulation framework developed by Cai (2015). Â To adapt the framework to the problem at hand several tasks were accomplished: agents representing {{the performance of the}} different devices of the plant were developed and inserted in the framework and generalized heuristics were incorporated to make the approach less computationally intensive. A case study of an existing <b>cooling</b> <b>plant</b> with significant complexity was utilized to conduct an extensive evaluation of the approach in terms of optimality and computational resources. Simulations were carried out using one year of historical data to predict the performance of the plant under three different control strategies: 1) multi-agent control, 2) centralized optimization based on mathematical programming techniques and 3) a heuristic control strategy. The results showed that significant savings can be achieved through the implementation of multi-agent control. It is expected that, if each hardware component of the plant comes with an integrated agent that represents its behavior, then the proposed multi-agent framework could automatically generate the multi-agent structure and control algorithm after some relatively simple pre-configuration steps. Â This will reduce the site-specific engineering and will provide a more economic and easy to configure solution for <b>central</b> <b>cooling</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{operational}} prediction and optimisation of heating, ventilating and {{air conditioning}} (HVAC) systems and central plant to minimise the energy required to maintain building indoor conditions have become increasingly important. To effectively design and implement an energy management program for building energy systems, a simulation study must be performed. This thesis describes research conducted into {{the development of a}} modular simulation program for analysing the performance of HVAC systems and central plant. The computer program uses a quasi-steady state modelling approach and is able to simulate a wide variety of systems which are configured using available component models. Steady state mathematical models of HVAC components are developed using fundamental heat and mass transfer principles, laws of conservation of mass and energy and where appropriate empirical data. The carponent models are formulated to allow for the effects of various control strategies on the performance of systems and plant to be investigated. The program is applied to simulate a part of the Collins' Building variable air volume (VAV) air conditioning system and a hypothetical <b>central</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>plant.</b> The results of the simulation exercises are presented and analysed.

It has efficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, consisting of a dual-fan/dual-duct variable air volume (VAV) system.

We also used model simulations of the study building to assess pre-cooling, a strategy that has been shown to improve demand saving and thermal comfort in many types of building.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analysis conducted upon the sensor data {{gathered from the}} distribution control system of a <b>central</b> heating and <b>cooling</b> <b>plant</b> in Ottawa, Canada. After observing that the performance of four boilers and five chillers of this plant vary substantially in time under steady-state conditions, data-driven models were developed to explain this variability from the archived sensor data. By employing a forward stepwise regression and a repeated random sub-sampling cross-validation approach, two-layer feed-forward artificial neural network models with seven to fifteen hidden-nodes were selected for each boiler and chiller. The selected boiler models could explain 84 to 95 % of the variability in a boiler's efficiency, and the selected chiller models could explain 65 to 94 % of the variability in a chiller's coefficient of performance. Among studied nine variables, the most informative ones to predict a boiler's efficiency were identified as follows: flue gas O 2 concentration, pressure, part-load ratio, forced draft fan state, and return water flow rate. Unlike boilers, all four studied variables were found useful in predicting a chiller's coefficient of performance. These four variables were the return water flow rate, part-load ratio, outdoor temperature, and return water temperature. A residual analysis was conducted to verify {{the appropriateness of the}} selected models to the datasets. In addition, potential use cases for the selected models were discussed with illustrative examples. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

Furthermore it's investigated if the pollution levels in the snow can decreased by treating the meltwater in the snow <b>cooling</b> <b>plant</b> and if it is economically feasible to use snow cooling. Simulations shows that between 1 % and 88 % of the hospital's cooling demand could be covered with snow cooling depending on the amount of snow that is accumulated during the winter.

A simplified <b>cooling</b> <b>plant</b> model is built. The chillers, cooling towers, and the ice storage system are modeled as different systems connected together.

The cores of these clusters indeed appear systematically different from cores with more prominent radio emission.

Also, {{there is no evidence}} for fossil X-ray cavities produced by an earlier episode of AGN heating. We suggest that either (1) the central gas has not yet cooled to the point at which feedback is necessary to prevent it from condensing, possibly because it is conductively stabilized, or (2) the gas experienced a major heating event � 1 Gyr in the past and has not required feedback since then.

AGN power in clusters with <b>central</b> atmospheric <b>cooling</b> times longer than ∼ 1 Gyr typically lies two orders of magnitude below those with shorter <b>central</b> <b>cooling</b> times. Galaxies centred in clusters with long <b>central</b> <b>cooling</b> times nevertheless experience ongoing and occasionally powerful AGN outbursts. We further investigate the impact of feedback on cluster scaling relations. We find L-T, and M-T relations in clusters with direct evidence of feedback which are steeper than self-similar, but not atypical compared to previous studies of the full cluster population. While the gas mass rises, the stellar mass remains nearly constant with rising total mass, consistent with earlier studies. This trend is found regardless of <b>central</b> <b>cooling</b> time, implying tight regulation of star formation in central galaxies as their halos grew, and long-term balance between AGN heating and atmospheric cooling.
