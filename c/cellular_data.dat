25|$|The program {{started with}} a $262,000 pilot in January 2008 on the Worcester Line, where 45 coaches were fitted with routers which {{connected}} to <b>cellular</b> <b>data</b> networks. This was the first wi-fi available on a commuter rail service in the United States. The Worcester Line was chosen for the pilot phase in part to compensate for low on-time performance, {{as well as to}} test the service across the line's varied terrain. The program was considered successful; in December 2008, the MBTA announced that wi-fi would be available on all trains by mid-2009. 258 of the 410 coaches then owned by the MBTA would receive wi-fi equipment {{at a rate of about}} 30 per month.|$|E
25|$|Reliable {{projections}} for CNS risks from space radiation exposure cannot {{be made at}} this time due to a paucity of data on the subject. Existing animal and <b>cellular</b> <b>data</b> do suggest that space radiation can produce neurological and behavioral effects; therefore, {{it is possible that}} mission operations will be impacted. The significance of these results on the morbidity to astronauts has not been elucidated, however. It is to be noted that studies, to date, have been carried out with relatively small numbers of animals (<10 per dose group); this means that testing of dose threshold effects at lower doses (<0.5 Gy) has not yet been carried out to a sufficient extent. As the problem of extrapolating space radiation effects in animals to humans will be a challenge for space radiation research, such research could become limited by the population size that is typically used in animal studies. Furthermore, the role of dose protraction has not been studied to date. An approach has not been discovered to extrapolate existing observations to possible cognitive changes, performance degradation, or late CNS effects in astronauts. Research on new approaches to risk assessment may be needed to provide the data and knowledge that will be necessary to develop risk projection models of the CNS from space radiation. A vigorous research program, which will be required to solve these problems, must rely on new approaches to risk assessment and countermeasure validation because of the absence of useful human radio-epidemiology data in this area.|$|E

2500|$|The {{combination}} of [...] in rainfall and a storm surge flooded coastal areas across central and northern Belize, including the cayes. During the storm, the City Emergency Management Organization, {{in addition to}} the Belize Defence Force, responded to over 100search and rescue requests. Flash flooding occurred in Cayo District, forcing additional residents to evacuate. Water levels remained high along rivers and dams for up to a week after the storm. Hurricane-force winds caused widespread infrastructure damage that affected power lines, transformers, and roofs. Two cell sites were destroyed, restricting <b>cellular</b> <b>data</b> service. The only part of the country that did not lose power during the storm was the northern portion of Belize. The resulting heavy debris blocked thoroughfares in affected areas, and bridges were damaged in San Ignacio and Calla Creek. Overall damage was heaviest in the country's central and western regions where several rivers burst their banks. Preliminary surveys indicate that Earl damaged or destroyed approximately 2,000homes in Belize, affecting 10,000people. Agricultural damage across the country was estimated at over US$100million, and overall damage was estimated at $BZ220million (US$110million). According to the final report of the International Red Cross, 10,355 people in 2,071 families were affected.|$|E

30|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been studies that {{explored}} the use of <b>cellular</b> network <b>data</b> for different purposes. These studies investigated various topics such as traffic estimation [11 – 14]; origin-destination flow estimation [15 – 19]; travel demand analysis [20 – 22]; land-use detection [23 – 25]; interplay between users’ mobility, location, and applications they access [26]; and place-related context inference [27, 28]. There {{is also a great}} body of literature that have analyzed the use of <b>cellular</b> network <b>data</b> {{in a wide range of}} issues, such as incident and traffic management [29]; urban sensing [30]; social networks, security, and privacy issues [31]. Our main concern of the present paper is to explore the potential of mobile phone data to infer the transport mode and, in particular, to analyze the influence of social network variables on transport mode choices. The remaining part of the related work section will be devoted to survey previous studies that have used mobile phone data for social network analysis.|$|R
