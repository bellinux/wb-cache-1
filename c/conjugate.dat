5|$|In aprotic solvents, oligomers, {{such as the}} {{well-known}} acetic acid dimer, may be formed by hydrogen bonding. An acid may also form hydrogen bonds to its <b>conjugate</b> base.

Homoconjugation enhances the proton-donating power of toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile solution by a factor of nearly 800. In aqueous solutions, homoconjugation does not occur, because water forms stronger hydrogen bonds to the <b>conjugate</b> base than does the acid.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{synthesize}} {{and evaluate}} hyperbranched polymer (HBP) -drug <b>conjugates</b> with high drug payload for enhanced cellular deliv-ery. Methods. Polyol- and polyglycerol-ibuprofen <b>conjugates</b> with or with-out imaging agent fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) were synthe-sized using dicyclohexilcarbodiimide (DCC) as a coupling agent. Drug-polymer <b>conjugates</b> were characterized using 13 C NMR, 1 H NMR, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Stability of the drug-conjugates was studied using free drug release through a dialysis membrane. Cellular entry of FITC-labeled HBP <b>conjugates</b> was stud-ied using fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS), and cell super-natant was analyzed by UV-visible spectrophotometer. The intracel-lular localization of FITC-labeled <b>conjugates</b> in A 549 lung epithelial cells was imaged using fluorescence microscopy. Anti-inflammatory {{activity of the}} HBP-ibuprofen <b>conjugates</b> was estimated in vitro by measuring the concentration of prostaglandin (PGE 2) using an ELISA kit. Results. The average number of ibuprofen molecules <b>conjugated</b> per molecule of HBP {{was estimated to be}} 50 for polyol and 53 for polyglycerol. The HBP-drug <b>conjugates</b> did not release the drug up to 72 h in methanol, indicating the presence of stable ester bonds. Both the polymer-drug <b>conjugates</b> entered the cells rapidly. The <b>conjugates</b> were localized in the cell cytosol as evidenced by fluorescence mi-croscopy. Within 30 min, the HBP-drug <b>conjugates</b> showed rapid suppression of PGE 2 synthesis, whereas free ibuprofen did not show any activity. At later times, the <b>conjugates</b> showed comparable activ-ity. Conclusions. For the first time, we report HBP <b>conjugates</b> with a high drug payload. HBP-drug <b>conjugates</b> entered the cells rapidly and produced the desired pharmacological action. This study demon-strates that hyperbranched polyol and polyglycerol are promising nanovehicles for achieving enhanced cellular delivery of drugs.
