The present work investigates the pultrusion of a Jute fabrics reinforced by the polymeric matrix material, which protects the Jute fabrics and improves the durability of fiber cement sheets. Different fiber volume fraction as well as polymeric matrix material blending ratios were investigated through the pultrusion technique and compared with the control untreated Jute fabrics reinforced <b>cementations</b> composites. Microstructure characteristics of the fabricâmatrix interface were also explored and correlated with the mechanical properties of the pultruded Jute fabrics reinforced <b>cementations</b> composite.

Long-term failures are due to either loss of bone around the tooth and/or gingiva due to peri-implantitis or a mechanical failure of the implant. Because there is no dental enamel on an implant, it does not fail due to cavities like natural teeth. While large-scale, long-term studies are scarce, several systematic reviews estimate the long-term (five to ten years) survival of dental implants at 9398 percent depending on their clinical use. During initial development of implant retained teeth, all crowns were attached to the teeth with screws, but more recent advancements have allowed placement of crowns on the abutments with dental cement (akin to placing a crown on a tooth). This has created the potential for cement, that escapes from under the crown during <b>cementation</b> to {{get caught in the}} gingiva and create a peri-implantitis (see picture below).

Among these tests, determination of surface electrical resistance of the concrete by using a fully integrated 4 -point Wenner probe is really beneficial due to its simplicity, low cost and good relationship {{with the results of}} various parameters related to the durability and strength of the concrete. This study examined the relationship between surface electrical resistance and compressive strength of the concrete. To achieve this goal, the concrete specimens with a ratio of water to <b>cementations</b> materials, grade of cement materials and different alternative <b>cementations</b> materials were made and they have been tested by compressive strength and the surface electrical resistance in different ages. In fact, the concrete surface electrical resistance is dependent on two main parameters including; the structure of cement paste pores and chemical properties of pore water. Due to the impact of the cement paste porosity on the concrete compressive strength, this study showed that the compressive strength can be carefully estimated indirectly by keeping other parameters constant though the surface electrical resistance in a specific concrete.

30|$|According to ASTM C 618 - 08 fly ashes are {{distinguished}} in {{two classes}} (F and C). Class F ash is usually produced by burning anthracite or bituminous coal while Class C fly ash is normally produced by burning sub bituminous coal or lignite. The main criterion for the above classification {{is the sum}} of silicon dioxide (SiO 2), aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3) and ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3) which in Class F must be at least 70  % while in Class C must be higher than 50  %. Class F is rarely <b>cementations</b> when mixed with water alone possessing pozzolanic properties. Class F fly ash requires a cementing agent, such as Portland cement, hydrated lime, with the presence of water in order to react and produce cementitious compounds. Unlike Class F, Class C fly ash exhibit usually <b>cementations</b> in addition to pozzolanic properties, it does not require an activator. In the presence of water, Class C fly ash will harden and gain strength over time. The suitability for the use of fly ash in construction sector is determined based on certain criteria, such as the content of unburned carbon, reactive silica and alumina, sulfur trioxide levels and fineness. In recent years, the recycling of fly ash has become an increasing concern due to increasing landfill costs, strengthening environmental regulations, and current interest in sustainable development (Mofarrah and Husain 2013). Many applications have been developed for coal fly ash as a cement replacement material in concrete (Qian and Shi 2003; Collins and Jensen 1995). However due to different characteristics properties such application is uncommon for heavy oil fly ash (HOFA). The fly ash from heavy oil burning has a higher percentage of unburned carbon, less silica content, and a higher level of vanadium, nickel, and magnesium than coal fired fly ash. Due to higher proportion of unburned carbon and less silica content, HOFA does not acknowledge the good <b>cementations</b> property as coal fly ash. However, there are significant amount of HOFA is producing around the world that needs to me managed.|$|R
