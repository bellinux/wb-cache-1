40|$|Management {{of water}} {{resources}} implies the study of their quality and in recent times {{one of the main}} drawbacks is the presence of non-regulated products, the so-called "Emerging Contaminants (EC) ". Currently the study of these contaminants is among the research priorities of the main organizations dedicated to the protection of public and environmental, such as OMS, EPA or the EU Commission health. The list of emerging contaminants include a wide variety of products both industrial and domestic applications, whose harmful effects include toxicity, bioaccumulation, and even endocrine disruption. Conventional wastewater treatment technologies are not efficient at removing many of these contaminants, so effluents and reuse {{become one of the most}} significant sources of contamination, even many emerging pollutants are only partially degraded and are even more toxic byproducts than the parent compounds. This research is focused in the Guadalhorce porous aquifer (Malaga, south of Spain), to study the distribution of EC and the interaction with the hydrogeochemistry. 14 EC (Ibuprofen, Hydrochlorothiazide, Salicilic Acid, Triclosan, Menfenamic Acid, Carbamazepine, Trimethoprim, Ofloxacin, Cafeine, Metotrexato, Metronidazole, Sulfadiazine, Sulfamethazine and Sulfamethoxazole) and 36 paramaters including electrical conductivity, T, pH, DO, major ions (Cl-, SO 42 -, HCO 3 -, NO 3 -, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Na+, K+), metals (B, Al, Fe, Mn, Cd, Pb, Zn, As and Se) and isotopes (d 2 H-H 2 O, d 18 O-H 2 O, d 34 S-SO 42 -) were controlled in a single field sampling (June 2012). Relationships between certain pollutants by its focus of origin are studied. Ibuprofen and Menfenamic acid follow the same pattern since they have the same use as anti-inflammatory agents and origin, mainly related to urban centers, which is important in the Guadalhorce area close to the mouth. Some possible explanations are the <b>close</b> <b>situation</b> of the Waste Water Treatment Plant of Malaga, numerous discharges of wastewater, irrigations with reused and non-reused water, among others. Nearby to the upper part of the aquifer, where farms and livestock are concentrated, pharmaceuticals for veterinary use are frequent. Furthermore, a relationship between certain emerging contaminants and hydrogeochemical characteristics present in the groundwater masses is observed, noting that ibuprofen, for example, has an indirect correlation to the temperature and concentration of certain ions such as chlorine and lead present in water masses. So it may be said that the distribution and concentration of emerging contaminants is not only affected by the number of pollution sources but also by the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the aquifer.

40|$|Sendo a consciência e a prática das regras fatores relevantes para a compreensão do desenvolvimento moral, os diferentes contextos que envolvem o jogar com regras, podem revelar-se espaços privilegiados para o estudo da moralidade infantil. De acordo com a abordagem psicogenética piagetiana, o jogo ao possibilitar a livre construção do conhecimento e estimular trocas sociais cooperativas, pode vir a favorecer a superação do egocentrismo moral e intelectual, aspecto este indispensável à construção de juízos morais autônomos. Optou-se no presente estudo por focalizar mais diretamente a relação da criança com a regra em diferentes situações, utilizando-se o jogo como pretexto para o estudo desta relação. O próprio Piaget em seu texto de 1932 usa um jogo de regras para estudar a moralidade e defende esta atividade como uma instituição genuinamente infantil propícia ao desenvolvimento do respeito mútuo e do estado cooperativo {{fundamental}} a autonomia. Posto isto, a presente pesquisa teve como objetivo investigar diferentes formas de interação da criança com a regra em contextos de jogo, articulando-as com o desenvolvimento moral infantil, segundo o referencial psicogenético piagetiano. Participaram da pesquisa 64 crianças com idades entre 07 e 08 anos, divididas em 14 grupos com, em média, quatro componentes cada. Foram aplicadas diferentes situações de contato com regras, sendo que na primeira as crianças jogaram conforme regras prescritas pela experimentadora (situação fechada), na segunda havia a possibilidade da criança intervir e propor novas formas de jogar (situação intermediária) e na terceira foi solicitado que inventassem um jogo com o material fornecido. Foi realizada uma sessão semanal para cada modalidade de contexto descrita, com cada grupo, sendo uma por dia, durante três semanas. Concluída a aplicação dos diferentes contextos de regra, os sujeitos passaram por uma entrevista clínica, na qual foram investigadas suas concepções relativas à regra moral em contraposição a regra do jogo. A sistematização de todo o material coletado consistiu em análises exploratórias a partir da categorização das ações adotadas pelos sujeitos, principalmente aquelas de caráter mais social como, por exemplo, troca de ideias, uso das regras, consideração da perspectiva alheia, interajuda, realização de acordos consensuais, resolução de conflitos, tomadas de decisão, emissão de julgamentos, entre outras. Tais categorias foram então convertidas em indicadores empíricos, com os quais foi possível delimitar três vias de análise: relações entre indicadores; relações entre contextos e acompanhamento individual de cada sujeito. Os resultados demonstram diferentes manifestações de uso e compreensão da regra de acordo com cada contexto analisado, com maiores evidências de autonomia nas situações que propiciavam acordos mútuos e exigiam de forma mais acentuada a relação entre pessoas. Buscou-se, a partir da presente pesquisa, evidenciar aspectos relevantes da relação da criança com a regra no contexto de jogo, entendendo-a como parte importante de seu desenvolvimento moral. São discutidas, assim, algumas interfaces entre o jogar e a moralidade, tomando-se como base os usos e concepções infantis a respeito da regraBeing {{the conscience}} {{and the rules}} practicing relevant issues {{in the understanding of}} the moral development, the different scenes regarding the playing with the rules, could reveal themselves privileged spots for the childhood morality. According to the Piaget psychogenic, the game, as it makes possible the free knowledge construction and estimulate social collaborating exchanges, could encourage the overcoming of the moral and intellectual egocentrism, indispensable issue for the contruction of moral autonomic judgements. It was decided in this study to focus more directly on the childś relationship with the rule in different situations, using the game as an excuse to study this relationship. Piaget himself, in his 1932 texts, uses a rule game to study the morality and defend this activity as a genuine child institution wich provides the mutual respect development and the collaborating state, essential to the autonomy. Once exposed, the present research has the purpose to investigate different ways of child interactions with rules in games scenarios, combining them with the child moral development, following the piagetian model. In the research, 64 children in their 7 to 8 years participated, divided in 14 groups of 4 members each, on the average. It was applied different rule contact situations: in the first, the children played according the rules described by the experience instructor (<b>close</b> <b>situation),</b> in the second one, there was the possibility of the child to intervene and suggest new ways of playing (intermediary situation) and in the third one was solicited that the children invent a game with the provided material. It was realized a weekly session to each scenario described, in each group, once a day along three weeks. Once finished the different contexts applications, the subjects received a clinical interview, where their statements regarding moral rules in opposite to game rules was investigated. The construction scheme of the collected material was based in exploration analysis by the categorization of the adopted actions, mainly the actions with social intents as, for an example: ideas exchange, rules usage, another point of view consideration, interpeople helping, consensual agreements realizations, conflicts resolutions, decision choices, judgment states, among others. The categories was converted in empirical indicators, making possible to delimit three analysis ways: relation between indicators, relation between contexts and individual follow up of each subject. The results demonstrates different manifestations of the usage and rule understanding according to each analyzed context, with more evidence of autonomy in situations that provided mutual agreements and demanded more sharply the relationship between people. It was searched, by the present research, to evidence relevant matters in the child relation with the rule in a game context, understanding the rule as a important part of his moral development. Some interfaces between the play and morality are discussed, taking as a basis the uses and childrenś conceptions about the rul...|$|E

Landmarks consist {{of a combination of}} attention regions and Harris-Laplace corners. The attention regions are detected by a visual attention system which combines image-based, bottom-up and target-related, topdown information. The ability to perform target-directed search is used to search for expected landmarks. We analyze the amount of correct and false matches for bottom-up and top-down matching depending on different matching thresholds. It shows that whereas bottom-up matching is useful for situations in which the scene changes only slightly like during tracking, top-down matching has advantages in loop <b>closing</b> <b>situations</b> by detecting a much higher amount of correctly matched landmarks.

Many {{researchers}} in the HRI and ECA domains try to build robots and agents that exhibit human-like behavior in real-world <b>close</b> encounter <b>situations.</b> One major requirement for comparing such robots and agents {{is to have an}} objective quantitative metric for measuring naturalness in various kinds of interactions. Some researchers have already suggested techniques for measuring stress level, awareness etc using physiological signals like GSR and BVP. One problem of available techniques is that they are only tested with extreme situations and cannot according to the analysis provided in this paper distinguish the response of human subjects in natural interaction situations. One other problem of the available techniques is that most of them require calibration and some times ad-hoc adjustment for every subject. This paper explores the usefulness of various kinds of physiological signals and statistics in distinguishing natural and unnatural partner behavior in a <b>close</b> encounter <b>situation.</b> The paper also explores the usefulness of these statistics in various time slots of the interaction. Based on this analysis a regressor was designed to measure naturalness in <b>close</b> encounter <b>situations</b> and was evaluated using human-human and human-robot interactions and shown to achieve 92. 5 % accuracy in distinguishing natural and unnatural situations. ...|$|R
