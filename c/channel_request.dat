5000|$|Paging Success by far is {{the most}} complex KPI to deal with as the process of paging touches almost all the nodes in GSM system and is {{influenced}} by performance of each of them. That’s the reason why this write up on paging looks too interwoven and cross refers to too many things. But the plus point with paging is by the time paging success rate in a network gets improved; almost all the other KPIs too stand improved. In response to an incoming call, the MSC initiates the paging process by broadcasting a [...] "paging request" [...] message on the paging sub channel (IMSI or TMSI of the MS and its Paging Group) and starts timer T3113. A [...] "paging message" [...] consists of the mobile identity (IMSI or TMSI) of the MS being paged and its [...] "paging group number". A Paging Request Message may include more than one MS identification. The maximum number of paged MS per message is 4 when using [...] "TMSI" [...] for identification of the MS (maximum number of paged MS per message is 2 when using IMSI). The BSC receives this page and processes the paging request and schedules it for transmission on the PCH at appropriate time. The MS on its part will analyse the paging messages (and immediate assignment messages) sent on the paging sub channel corresponding to its paging group. Upon receipt of a [...] "paging request" [...] message, MS will initiate within 0.7s an immediate assignment procedure. Upon receipt of a page at the MS, the MS responds by transmitting a <b>channel</b> <b>request</b> on the RACH. BSS {{in response to the}} received [...] "channel request", will process it and immediately assign the MS a SDCCH (immediate assignment / assignment reject; done over AGCH). MS Paging response- After receiving the immediate assignment command, MS switches to the assigned [...] "SDCCH" [...] and transmits a [...] "Paging Response". The establishment of the main signalling link is then initiated with information field containing the [...] "PAGING RESPONSE" [...] message and the [...] "paging response" [...] is sent to the MSC. Upon receipt of the [...] "Paging Response" [...] MSC stops the timer T3113. If the timer T3113 expires and a [...] "Paging Response"message has not been received, the MSC may repeat the [...] "Paging Request" [...] message and start T3113 all over again.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} a multi-hop wireless network with a connection-oriented traffic model and multiple transmission channels {{that can be}} spatially re-used. In such a network the blocking probability of a call that makes a <b>channel</b> <b>request</b> depends on (a) the channel assignment scheme and (b) the transmission radius of the nodes which affects the network link structure. In this work, we study these two aspects for simple wireless networks. Specifically, we develop blocking probability analysis for a wireless line and grid network and explore the tradeoff between transmission radius and blocking probability for multi-hop calls. We show that for a line network a larger transmission radius can substantially reduce the blocking probability of calls, while for a grid network with a more dense node topology using a smaller transmission radius is better. We, then, investigate various channel assignment schemes and present a novel non-rearranging channel assignment algorithm for multi-hop calls in a general network. Our algorithm efficiently incorporates spatial channel re-use and significantly reduces call blocking probability {{when compared to other}} algorithms.

40|$|As {{defined by}} IEEE 802. 15. 6 standard, channel sharing is a {{potential}} method to coordinate inter-network interference among Medical Body Area Networks (MBANs) that are close to one another. However, channel sharing opens up new vulnerabilities as selfish MBANs may manipulate their online channel requests to gain unfair advantage over others. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a truthful online channel sharing algorithm and a companion protocol that allocates channel efficiently and truthfully by punishing MBANs for misreporting their <b>channel</b> <b>request</b> parameters such as time, duration and bid for the channel. We first present an online channel sharing scheme for unit-length channel requests and prove that it is truthful. We then generalize our model to settings with variable-length channel requests, where we propose a critical value based channel pricing and preemption scheme. A bid adjustment procedure prevents unbeneficial preemption by artificially raising the ongoing winner’s bid controlled by a penalty factor λ. Our scheme can efficiently detect selfish behaviors by monitoring a trust parameter α of each MBAN and punish MBANs from cheating by suspending their requests. Our extensive simulation results show our scheme can achieve a total profit {{that is more than}} 85 % of the offline optimum method in the typical MBAN settings. 19 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{growth in}} mobile {{telephone}} traffic in wireless cellular networks, {{along with the}} limited number of channels available, presents a challenge for the efficient reuse of channels. Channel allocation problem becomes more complicated if one or more cells in the network become “hot-spots” for some period of time, i. e., the bandwidth resources currently available in those cells are not sufficient to sustain the needs of current users in the cells. This paper presents a new hybrid channel allocation algorithm in which the base station sends a multi-level “hotspot” notification to the central pool located at Mobile Switching Station (MSC) on each <b>channel</b> <b>request</b> that cannot be satisfied locally at the base station. This notification will request more than one channel be assigned to the requesting cell, proportional to the current hot-spot level of the cell. When a call using such a “borrowed” channel terminates, the cell may retain the channel depending upon its current hot-spot level. The simulation study of the protocol indicates that the protocol has low overhead, and it behaves similar to the Fixed Channel Allocation (FCA) scheme at high traffic and to the Dynamic Channel Allocation (DCA) scheme at low traffic loads. The proposed algorithm also offers low-overhead {{in terms of the number}} of control messages exchanged between a base station and the MSC on channel acquisition and release phases. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{wireless}} {{mobile communication}} systems, proper channel allocation scheme is required. Due to {{the limitation of}} available frequency spectrum, channels must be reused {{as much as possible}} to increase system capacity. Complication arises in channel allocation, when more than one cell become “hot-spot ” in the network of one BSC. The cells become “hot-spot ” when bandwidth resources currently available in those cells are not sufficient to sustain any more call. In hybrid channel allocation, cells send a multilevel hot-spot notification to the dynamic pool of BSC on each <b>channel</b> <b>request</b> that cannot be satisfied locally at the base station. Proportional to the current hot-spot level of the cell, this hot-spot notification will request more than one channel to assign to the requesting cell. Severe complication arises, when not even one channel available in the dynamic pool of BSC in order to assign to requesting cells. This is the situation, when call starts dropping or blocking. This paper presents a new scheme in which BSC will fetch those ideal channels, which are borrowed to requesting cell from the dynamic pool in the time of hot spot but become ideal in the temporary pool of BTS for some period of time. BTS make use of these channels in order to sustain new incoming call. The proposed algorithm in this paper will reduce the call dropping probability comparatively more than the simple hybrid channel allocation algorithm.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical and Computer Science EngineeringVideo {{streaming}} {{over the}} Internet {{has become the}} most sought after application and is growing at a very fast rate. Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) is a technology that has been growing fast, replacing traditional cable TV. With the rapid development in the high speed networks, multimedia streaming over the internet has increased incredibly, of which video streaming is the major source of traffic in the core network. Hence IPTV video streaming over the core network {{has become one of the}} active topics for research. The major challenge associated with IPTV traffic is the fact that video traffic requires more bandwidth and is more sensitive to delay and packet loss due to congestion. Lots of research has been done to provide an Admission Control algorithm for IPTV traffic. Admission Control becomes an essential part as it is typically enforced to ensure QoS in the network. It helps prevent bottleneck in the core network. This thesis proposes an efficient method to provide admission control for IPTV traffic in the core network by using multiple GRIP probe packets to check the resource availability in the core network for the new incoming <b>channel</b> <b>request.</b> Moreover, the algorithm proves that using multiple video qualities in the network helps increase the number of channels delivered to the end user, thus satisfying more users, as opposed to single video quality. Using multiple GRIP packets made the proposed method more reliable and it was seen that on an average, the number of channels delivered to the end user was increase over 90 %...|$|E

Like other Infrastructure wireless networks, the base station is responsible for providing information about available spectrum, security management and cooperation amongst CR nodes in the infrastructure network (Fig.  1 b). Cordeiro et al. (2005) has presented the first worldwide wireless standard IEEE 802.22 for cognitive radios. The applicability and market of IEEE 802.22 is restricted to remote and rural areas and the TV channel bandwidths of 6, 7 and 8  MHz have been specified as the most appropriate spectrum band for unlicensed users to transmit. Further enhancements on IEEE 802.22 has been presented by Carl et al. (Stevenson et al. 2009). Their article presents a high-level overview of the IEEE 802.22 standard for cognitive wireless regional area networks (WRANs) that is under development in the IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee. A dynamic spectrum access (DSA) protocol (DSAP) has been presented in (Brik et al. 2005) which makes use of DSAP server and DSAP relay which are centralized entities that coordinate spectrum access requests and allow multi-hop communication between DSAP clients. The server accepts spectrum lease requests from clients and assigns the spectrum resources with certain constraints such as a time for lease. Like the {{dynamic host configuration protocol}} (DHCP), DSAP also makes use of a channel-discover request which is responded to by a channel offer message and a <b>channel</b> <b>request</b> message. Both these messages contain the channel details and lease criteria. A channel acknowledgement (ACK) is sent by the DSAP server to either accept or decline clients’ requests for lease. In the case that there is primary user (PU) occupancy, a channel reclaim message is sent to the client, forcing it to terminate or reassign clients’ lease. In spite of the dedicated central entity that is in DSAP, the exchange of five control frames as control information, prior to any data transmission, imposes a high computational cost and pre-transmission overheads.|$|E

40|$|Groupe Spécial Mobile (GSM) {{has been}} {{developed}} as the pan-European second generation of digital mobile systems. GSM operates in the 900 MHz frequency band and employs digital technology instead of the analogue technology of its predecessors. Digital technology enables the GSM system to operate in much smaller zones {{in comparison with the}} analogue systems. The GSM system will offer greater roaming facilities to its subscribers, extended throughout the countries that have installed the system. The GSM system could be seen as a further enhancement to European integration. GSM has adopted a contention-based protocol for multipoint-to-point transmission. In particular, the slotted-ALOHA medium access protocol is used to coordinate the transmission of the <b>channel</b> <b>request</b> messages between the scattered mobile stations. Collision still happens when more than one mobile station having the same random reference number attempts to transmit on the same time-slot. In this research, a modified version of this protocol {{has been developed}} {{in order to reduce the}} number of collisions and hence increase the random access channel throughput compared to the existing protocol. The performance evaluation of the protocol has been carried out using simulation methods. Due to the growing demand for mobile radio telephony as well as for data services, optimal usage of the scarce availability radio spectrum is becoming increasingly important. In this research, a protocol has been developed whereby the number of transmitted information packets over the GSM system is increased without any additional increase of the allocated radio spectrum. Simulation results are presented to show the improvements achieved by the proposed protocol. Cellular mobile radio networks commonly respond to an increase in the service demand by using smaller coverage areas. As a result, the volume of the signalling exchanges increases.

This fast growing field will emerge as a new research field in near future having interaction with the outer world with the development of numerous interesting ubiquitous applications. The main aim of this special issue was to collect original research papers that present recent advances and future directions in Ubiquitous environment from theoretical as well as practical point of view. This special issue is a collection of research papers from all aspects of this new emerging field e. g. design, implementation and future aspects as well as challenges and constraints in this field. This special issue contains a diverse collection of high-quality papers authored by eminent academicians and researchers in the field. In the first paper, Kamal et. al. propose a Location dependent Connectivity guarantee Key management scheme for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (LOCK) without using de ployment knowledge. A pair-wise, group wise and cluster key is generated efficiently for participating nodes. LOCK provides dynamicity by two ways; one by not completely depending upon pre deployed information and other by not completely depending upon location. Scheme is proved to support largest possible network using smallest storage overhead as compared to existing key management schemes. In the second paper, Rahat et. al. have developed a multi-user location-awareness system by following a user-centred design and evaluation approach. The authors discuss the development of the system that allows users to share informative feedback about their current geographical location. Also the proposed system can be used by various users, for example family members, relatives or a group of friends, in order to share the information related to their locations and to interact with each other.   In the next paper, Sanjay et. al., propose to get the knowledge about the software systems in software reengineering.   In the proposed approach, the mapping of domain to the code using the information retrieval techniques and linguistic information, such as identifier names and comments in source code has been used. Moreover, concept of Semantic Clustering has been introduced in this paper and an algorithm has been provided to group source artifacts based on how the synonymy and polysemy is related. Based on semantic similarity automatic labeling of the program code is done after detecting the clusters, and is visually explore in 3 -Dimension for discrete characterization. In the next paper, Manpreet et al. propose resource allocation on grid using ant colony algorithm. The major objective of resource allocation in grid is effective scheduling of tasks and in turn the reduction of execution time. For efficient resource allocation an Ant colony algorithm is proposed, {{which is one of the}} heuristic algorithm suits well for the allocation and scheduling in grid environment. In the next paper, author proposes a channel allocation algorithm for hot spot cells in wireless networks.   The proposed scheme presents a new hybrid channel allocation algorithm in which the base station sends a multi-level hot-spot notification to the central pool located at Mobile Switching Station (MSC) on each <b>channel</b> <b>request</b> that cannot be satisfied locally at the base station. This notification will request more than one channel be assigned to the requesting cell, proportional to the current hot-spot level of the cell. When a call using such a borrowed channel terminates, the cell may retain the channel depending upon its current hot-spot level. In the next paper, Meenu Kumari et. al. propose a JPEG Compression Steganography & Cryptography using Image-Adaptation Technique.   Authors have designed a system that allows an average user to transfer text messages by hiding them in a digital image file using the local characteristics within an image. This paper is a combination of steganography and encryption algorithms, which provides a strong backbone for its security. The proposed system not only hides large volume of data within an image, but also limits the perceivable distortion that might occur in an image while processing it.   In the next paper, Shalini et. al. provides an exhaustive review of machine learning approaches used for Web Services discovery and frameworks developed based on these approaches. A thorough analysis of existing frameworks for semantic discovery of Web Services is also provided in this paper.   Special Thanks Guest Editors would like to extend sincere thanks to all the people who have contributed their time and efforts in making this special issue a grand success.

40|$|A Land-Mobile Satellite System (LMSS) is a satellite-based {{communications}} network which provides voice and data communications to mobile users {{in a vast}} geographic area. An integrated demand-assigned multiple-access protocol has been developed for the experimental LMSS. The pool of channels is divided into reservation channels and information channels. The information channels can be assigned by the network management center (NMC) to be either voice channels or data channels. Each mobile user must send a request {{through one of the}} reservation channels to the NMC via the ALOHA random-access scheme. Once the request is received and processed, the NMC will examine the current traffic condition and assign an information channel to the user. NMC will periodically update the partitions between the reservation channels, voice channels, and data channels to optimize system performance. Data <b>channel</b> <b>requests</b> are queued at the NMC while voice <b>channel</b> <b>requests</b> are blocked calls cleared. Various operational scenarios have been investigated.
