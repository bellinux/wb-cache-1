For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the <b>cocaine</b> <b>alkaloid,</b> were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction.

50|$|Coca {{is known}} {{throughout}} the world for its psychoactive <b>alkaloid,</b> <b>cocaine.</b> The <b>alkaloid</b> content of coca leaves is relatively low, between 0.25% and 0.77%. The native people use it for a stimulant, like coffee, an energy source. Coca leaf extract {{had been used in}} Coca-Cola products since 1885, with cocaine being completely eliminated from the products in or around 1929. Extraction of cocaine from coca requires several solvents and a chemical process known as an acid / base extraction, which can fairly easily extract the alkaloids from the plant.|$|R
50|$|Tropane is a {{nitrogenous}} 3.2.1 bicyclic organic compound. It {{is mainly}} {{known for a}} group of alkaloids derived from it (called tropane alkaloids), which include, among others, atropine and <b>cocaine.</b> Tropane <b>alkaloids</b> occur in plants of the families Erythroxylaceae (including coca) and Solanaceae (including mandrake, henbane, deadly nightshade, datura, potato, tomato).|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{stimulant}} and hunger-suppressant {{properties of}} coca {{had been known}} for many centuries, {{the isolation of the}} <b>cocaine</b> <b>alkaloid</b> was not achieved until 1855. Various European scientists had attempted to isolate cocaine, but none had been successful for two reasons: the knowledge of chemistry required was insufficient at the time, and contemporary conditions of sea-shipping from South America could degrade the cocaine in the plant samples available to European chemists.|$|E
50|$|As a result, Bolivian lab {{operators}} {{are now using}} inferior substitutes such as cement instead of lime and sodium bicarbonate instead of ammonia and recycled solvents like ether. Some non-solvent fuels such as gasoline, kerosene and diesel fuel are even used in place of solvents. Manufacturers are attempting to streamline a production process that virtually eliminates oxidation to produce cocaine base. Some laboratories are not using sulfuric acid during the maceration state; consequently, less <b>cocaine</b> <b>alkaloid</b> is extracted from the leaf, producing less cocaine hydrochloride, the powdered cocaine marketed for overseas consumption.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pharmacologically}} {{active ingredient}} of coca is the <b>cocaine</b> <b>alkaloid,</b> which {{is found in}} the amount of about 0.3 to 1.5%, averaging 0.8%, in fresh leaves. Besides cocaine, the coca leaf contains a number of other alkaloids, including methylecgonine cinnamate, benzoylecgonine, truxilline, hydroxytropacocaine, tropacocaine, ecgonine, cuscohygrine, dihydrocuscohygrine, nicotine, and hygrine. When chewed, coca acts as a mild stimulant and suppresses hunger, thirst, pain, and fatigue. [...] Absorption of coca from the leaf is less rapid than nasal application of purified forms of the alkaloid (almost all of the coca alkaloid is absorbed within 20 minutes of nasal application, while it takes 2-12 hours after ingestion of the raw leaf for alkaline concentrations to peak.). When the raw leaf is consumed in tea, between 59 and 90% of the coca alkaloid is absorbed.|$|E

5000|$|Freebasing {{is a more}} {{efficient}} method of self-administering alkaloids via the smoking route. For example, cocaine hydrochloride decomposes at the high temperatures necessary for smoking. Free base cocaine, in which the <b>cocaine</b> <b>alkaloid</b> is [...] "freed" [...] from the hydrochloride salt, has a melting point of 98 ℃ and is volatile at temperatures above 90 ℃, therefore providing an active drug for smoking. The free base form of an alkaloid is more lipid-soluble and crosses the blood-brain barrier more easily, thus having a faster and stronger [...] "impact" [...] or [...] "kick", which is comparable to intravenous injection. Extraction kits for converting the hydrochloride to the base are commercially available. Freebasing also tends to remove water-soluble impurities and adulterants such as sugars (lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, inositol), which are often added to street cocaine. Cocaine freebase is only slightly soluble in water (1 in 600 of water) {{as compared to the}} high solubility of cocaine hydrochloride (1 in 0.5 of water).|$|E

40|$|Real-time {{quantitative}} PCR is {{a powerful}} technique for the investigation of comparative gene expression, but its accuracy and reliability depend on the reference genes used as internal standards. Only genes that show {{a high level of}} expression stability are suitable for use as reference genes, and these must be identified on a case-by-case basis. Erythroxylum coca produces and accumulates high amounts of the pharmacologically active tropane <b>alkaloid</b> <b>cocaine</b> (especially in the leaves), and is an emerging model for the investigation of tropane alkaloid biosynthesis. The identification of stable internal reference genes for this species is important for its development as a model species, and would enable comparative analysis of candidate biosynthetic genes in the different tissues of the coca plant. In this study, we evaluated the expression stability of nine candidate reference genes in E. coca (Ec 6409, Ec 10131, Ec 11142, Actin, APT 2, EF 1 α, TPB 1, Pex 4, Pp 2 aa 3). The expression of these genes was measured in seven tissues (flowers, stems, roots and four developmental leaf stages) and the stability of expression was assessed using three algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper). From our results we conclude that Ec 10131 and TPB 1 are the most appropriate internal reference genes in leaves (where the majority of cocaine is produced), while Ec 10131 and Ec 6409 are the most suitable internal reference genes across all of the tissues tested...|$|R

Cocaine dependence is a major public health problem because its use {{can be associated with}} medical and psychosocial complications including the spread of infectious diseases (such as AIDS, hepatitis and tuberculosis), crime, violence and neonatal drug exposure. This review looked at the evidence on the efficacy and acceptability of antidepressants alone or in combination with a psychosocial intervention for the treatment of cocaine abuse and dependence. Current evidence from randomised controlled trials does not support the use of antidepressants. Positive results obtained by antidepressants on mood-related outcomes are consistent with the primary effect of antidepressants.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Coca leaves (Erythroxylum coca) {{have been}} {{promoted}} {{as a food}} that could address the dietary deficiencies of the Andean population, but {{this is based on}} nutrient analyses of a small sample of leaves. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the nutritional potential of eight samples of coca leaves grown in different regions of Peru. METHODS: We used AOAC techniques to measure nutrients, nutrient inhibitors (phytate, polyphenols, oxalic acid, and fiber), and alkaloid concentrations, all expressed per 100 g dry weight (DW) of the ground leaves. Minerals were measured by inductively coupled lasma- mass spectrometry in n twondependent laboratories. RESULTS: The leaves contained protein,, 20. 28 g/ 1 0 DW with lysine as the limiting amino acid; n-cbetarotene, 3. 51 mg/ 100 gDW; vitamin E, 16. 72 mg/ 100 gDW; trace amounts of vitamin D; calcium, 990. 18 and 1033. 17 mg/ 100 gDW at two different laboratories; iron, 29. 16 and 29. 16 mg/ 100 gDW; zinc, 2. 71 and 2. 63 mg/ 100 gDW; and magnesium, 225. 19 and 196. 69 mg/l 001 gDW Cocaine was the principal alkaloid, with a concentration of 0. 56 g/ 100 gDW; other alkaloids were also identified. The results were compared with those for other edible leaves. The nutrient contributions of coca powder (5 g) and bread made with coca were compared with those of normal portions of alternative foods. CONCLUSIONS: Two spoonfuls of coca leaf flour would satisfy less than 10 % of dietary intakes for schoolchildren and adults for critical commonly deficient nutrients in the diet. Coca leaves do not provide nutritional benefits when eaten in the recommended quantities, and the presence of absorbable <b>cocaine</b> and other <b>alkaloids</b> may be potentially harmful; hence coca leaves cannot be recommended as a food...|$|R
40|$|Potentiometry is a {{subdivision}} of electrochemistry which measures an electric potential between an indicator electrode and a reference electrode. Worldwide, this technique {{has been used}} for several decennia mostly to sensitively and reliably determine about two dozen of inorganic ions. However, there is a growing interest in the development of potentiometry-based biosensors for the life sciences. Potentiometric sensors could be a good choice due to the price, simplicity, robustness, speed and miniaturization potential of these products. During this project, we have developed potentiometric (bio) sensors to determine a set of small organic molecules. As biological recognition element we have used short DNA oligonucleotide probes or aptamers. In a first phase of this project the characteristics of potentiometric sensors were investigated critically. This revealed that the response of potentiometric sensors was largely determined by adsorption/desorption kinetic phenomena, and by association constants (Ka) reflecting receptor/analyte binding strength. We showed that potentiometry could be used as an alternative for e. g. surface plasmon resonance to study molecular interaction analysis. The obtained sensorgrams made it possible to calculate association (or dissociation) constants and Gibbs free energies for a target molecule with a potentiometric membrane or with a specific recognition element. Ka values are important in e. g. molecular biology, pharmacy, etc., but also in the world of biosensors. Before continuing to biosensors, we also studied the robustness and speed of these sensors by coupling the potentiometric electrodes with an Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography system (UPLC). It was possible to detect target molecules such as cocaine in complex mixtures like urine and plasma, using the organic modifier solvents applied in UPLC systems. In natural samples such as plasma and urine, and with a minimum of sample preparation, a detection limit below the Maximum Residue Limit was reached for e. g. cocaine. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient confirmed the good correlation between the data obtained with UPLC/potentiometry and with the standardized method (LC-MS). The biomolecular interactions between the important <b>alkaloids</b> <b>cocaine</b> and metergoline with their specific aptamers (which can be used in biosensors) were then examined with potentiometric titrations in batch systems. We therefore had to abandon the classical paths of potentiometric titration, and develop “Response transformed potentiometric titration”. This technique can work at concentrations below the linear potentiometric calibration curve range, which makes it much more compatible with biomolecular conditions. The alkaloids showed higher association constants (= stronger binding) with their selected aptamers as compared to other oligonucleotides. Also the specificity and cross-reactivity were checked. These results were in accordance with the ones from the literature, determined with other techniques. Response transformed potentiometric titrations revealed to be good candidates to examine the association/dissociation constants and the cross-reactivities of the targets with their selected aptamers. Finally, a method was developed to make specific biosensors to detect interesting small molecules with Flow injection Analysis. DNA oligonucleotide probes and aptamers were used as specific recognition elements. The detection of dopamine with an anti-dopamine aptamer, incorporated into a potentiometric sensor, was the first successful biosensor during this project. The comparison of the biomolecular interaction analysis showed that the interaction of dopamine with the aptamer yielded a lower dissociation constant (= stronger binding) then the interaction of dopamine with a random oligonucleotide or with a blank electrode. Also the specificity was thoroughly checked. The future and application possibilities of the above findings are dual. On the one hand, the developed sensor can be used in applications of specific detection. On the other hand, also the obvious possibility exists to use the present technology to examine molecular interactions. status: publishe...|$|R
