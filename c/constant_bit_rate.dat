5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a <b>constant</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate,</b> something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E

However, video on an XVCD is typically encoded at a variable bit rate (VBR), so complex scenes can use a much higher data rate for a short time, while simpler scenes will use lower data rates. Some XVCDs use lower bitrates in order to fit longer videos onto the disc, while others use higher bitrates to improve quality. MPEG-2 may be used instead of MPEG-1.|$|E

2500|$|This {{observation}} {{caused a}} revolution in audio encoding. Early on bitrate was the prime and only consideration. At the time MP3 files were of the very simplest type: they used the same bit rate for the entire file: this process is known as <b>Constant</b> <b>Bit</b> <b>Rate</b> (CBR) encoding. Using a <b>constant</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> makes encoding simpler and less CPU intensive. However, {{it is also possible}} to create files where the bit rate changes throughout the file. These are known as Variable Bit Rate The bit reservoir and VBR encoding were actually part of the original MPEG-1 standard. The concept behind them is that, in any piece of audio, some sections are easier to compress, such as silence or music containing only a few tones, while others will be more difficult to compress. So, the overall quality of the file may be increased by using a lower bit rate for the less complex passages and a higher one for the more complex parts. With some advanced MP3 encoders, it is possible to specify a given quality, and the encoder will adjust the bit rate accordingly. Users that desire a particular [...] "quality setting" [...] that is transparent to their ears can use this value when encoding all of their music, and generally speaking not need to worry about performing personal listening tests on each piece of music to determine the correct bit rate.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{transfer}} of pre-recorded compressed video requires the network to support large fluctuations in bandwidth on multiple time scales. Bandwidth smoothing techniques are often employed {{for reducing the}} burstiness of a pre-recorded compressed video stream by prefetching frames into the client playback bu#er. Using these techniques, a variable <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> (VBR) stream can be represented {{as a series of}} fixed <b>constant</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rates</b> (CBR), thus simplifying the allocation of network resources and increasing their utilization. The smoothing process and the temporary accumulation of data stream in a client bu#er before playback increase the advantage of multiplexing. This is because they remove the serial correlation produced by the variable length entropy coders and the smoothing of the short-term sub-image bit-rate variabilities [1]. Smoothing the tra#c before launching packets into the network can also increase network reliability since the packet loss behavior of a network...|$|R

Such recurrent path failures have {{detrimental effects on the}} network ability to support Quality of Service (QoS) driven services. A number of technology providers have implemented methods for multiplexing the data along with the compressed audio and video. These methods rely either on the allocation of data bandwidth as a <b>constants</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> (CBR) stream or the replacement of null packets in the MPEG stream with the data.

As ISPs are upgrading their networks to support multicast, they see the opportunity to use less resources to offer their customers quality VoD by making use of efficient scheduling techniques. Of the techniques studied, we found the Cautious Harmonic Broadcasting (CHB) algorithm to be most promising. CHB is designed to schedule video streams over a multicast network. Reduced transmission bandwidth {{is one of the}} benefits of using this algorithm. Our most important contribution was designing a CHB streaming server and client, and implementing a prototype of each. Our server prototype has successfully put the CHB algorithm into practice. In our implementation we used the live 555 framework, enabling future integration with open source media players like VLC and MPlayer. In our assessment of the prototypes we have performed a series of tests to evaluate the performance. We suggest that conflicting use of variable and <b>constant</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rates</b> can be one factor that can interfere with the CHB scheduling.
