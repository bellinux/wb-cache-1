In November 1962, during this annual distribution, {{it was discovered that}} there were some rare and valuable dates, still sealed in their original mint bags, all in uncirculated condition, among the millions of dollar coins still in the Treasury vaults. Collectors/investors/dealers lined up to purchase them in $1,000 bags, trading silver certificates for the coins. Before this event, the great rarity of the Morgan series was 1903-O, which was by far the most expensive of the entire set. It was discovered that there were millions of this specific date and mint in the Treasury vaults; an estimated 84% of the entire mintage sat in these bags, untouched for 60 years, all in uncirculated condition.

These kits sold fairly well and <b>can</b> still <b>be</b> found on auction sites such as eBay at reasonable prices. The details in these kits far exceeded any from the 1960s. In the late 1990s AMT did something new in releasing pre-assembled and painted versions of these kits. These assembled models were sold as the Masterpiece Series and were nicely packaged in foam, similar to heavier diecast metal Franklin Mint or Danbury Mint models. Each had a Certificate of Authenticity enclosed. These models were beautifully finished and featured whitewall tires along with very detailed and authentically painted engines, suspensions and interiors, much more detailed than any promotional ever was, although these seem to be oriented to the adult collector and not the possible customer. Selections included a 1957 Chrysler 300C, 1960 Ford Starliner, 1962 Chevrolet Impala SS convertible, 1962 Pontiac Catalina SD421, 1966 Buick Riviera {{and a few others}} (Doty 2002b, p87).

60|$|Again, {{though there}} are few {{commodities}} which are at all times and forever unsusceptible of increase of supply, any commodity whatever may be temporarily so; and with some commodities this is habitually the case. Agricultural produce, for example, can not be increased in quantity before the next harvest; the quantity of corn already existing {{in the world is}} all that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> sometimes a year to come. During that interval, corn is practically assimilated to things of which the quantity can not be increased. In the case of most commodities, it requires a certain time to increase their quantity; and if the demand increases, then, until a corresponding supply can be brought forward, that is, until the supply can accommodate itself to the demand, the value will so rise as to accommodate the demand to the supply.|$|E

60|$|Here, then, is an {{inevitable}} inequality, {{which may be}} denominated that of power. In order to render this as small as possible, a legislator will {{be careful not to}} give greater force to such authority than is essential to its due execution. Government is at best but a necessary evil. Compelled to place themselves in a state of subordination, men will obviously endeavour to prevent the abuse of that superiority to which they submit; accordingly they will cautiously avoid whatever may lead those in whom it is acknowledged to suppose they hold it as a right. Nothing will more effectually contribute to this than that the person in whom authority has been lodged should occasionally descend to the level of private citizen; he will learn from it a wholesome lesson, and the people will be less liable to confound the person with the power. On this principle hereditary authority will be proscribed; and on another also--that in such a system as that of hereditary authority, no security <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> talents adequate to the discharge of the office, and consequently the people can only feel the mortification of being humbled without having protected themselves.|$|E

INTRODUCTION The concepts of norm and obligation have achieved a renewed interest for their importance in multi-agent systems [19], [17].

We study this problem in the framework of property testing: Given a query access to a data set S, we wish to determine whether S is low-dimensional, or whether it should be modified significantly in order to have the property. Allowing a constant probability of error, we aim at algorithms whose complexity does not depend on the size of S. We present algorithms for testing the low-dimensionality of a set of vectors and for testing whether a matrix is of low rank. We then address low-dimensionality in metric spaces. For vectors in the metric space l 1, we show that low-dimensionality is not testable. For l 2, we show that a data set <b>can</b> <b>be</b> tested <b>for</b> <b>having</b> a low-dimensional structure, but that the property of approximately having such a structure is not testable...|$|R

Resource Planner is a convenient tool to handle various projects in {{a software}} company efficiently. It is an online tool to manage projects currently running with the company as well as future projects. This tool tracks the employees working for the existing projects and details of new projects like no. of employees required, location, etc., and also estimates revenue which helps higher management to know the status of the various projects and work force. With this tool, HR can estimate the requirement of employees for the new projects and hence can recruit exact number of employees. The project manager can view the details of the employees in the company and the employees in his projects. He can also get the information of how many employees are there in a particular project and their skill set. When he wants employees for a particular project, he can add that information mentioning how many are working on the project and how many employees are totally needed for the project. This information <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>had</b> both <b>for</b> online and offline projects. This information is used in generating a special report called GAP summary.

Of duels we have {{sometimes}} spoken: how, {{in all parts of}} France, innumerable duels were fought; and argumentative men and messmates, flinging down the wine-cup and weapons of reason and repartee, met in the measured field; to part bleeding; or perhaps not to part, but to fall mutually skewered through with iron, their wrath and life alike ending,--and die as fools die. Long has this lasted, and still lasts. But now it would seem as if in an august Assembly itself, traitorous Royalism, in its despair, had taken to a new course: that of cutting off Patriotism by systematic duel!
