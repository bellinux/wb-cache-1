5|$|The main trade route {{leading into}} Han China passed first through Kashgar, yet Hellenized Bactria further west {{was the central}} node of {{international}} trade. By the 1st century AD, Bactria and much of Central Asia and North India were controlled by the Kushan Empire. Silk was the main export item from China to India. Indian merchants brought various goods to China, including tortoise shell, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, fine cloth, woolen textiles, perfume and incense, <b>crystal</b> <b>sugar,</b> pepper, ginger, salt, coral, pearls, glass items, and Roman wares. Indian merchants brought Roman styrax and frankincense to China, while the Chinese knew bdellium as a fragrant item from Persia, although it was native to West India. The tall Ferghana horses imported from Fergana were highly prized in Han China. The newly introduced exotic Central Asian grapes (i.e. vitis vinifera) were used to make grape wine, although the Chinese had rice wine before this. Glass luxury items from ancient Mesopotamia {{have been found in}} Chinese tombs and dated to the late Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BC). Roman glasswares have been found in Chinese tombs dating to the early 1st century BC, with the earliest specimen found at the southern Chinese seaport of Guangzhou. Silverwares from Roman- and Arsacid territories have also been found at Han tomb sites.|$|E
25|$|Mill white, {{also called}} {{plantation}} white, <b>crystal</b> <b>sugar</b> or superior sugar is produced from raw sugar. It {{is exposed to}} sulfur dioxide during the production to reduce the concentration of color compounds and helps prevent further color development during the crystallization process. Although common to sugarcane-growing areas, this product does not store or ship well. After a few weeks, its impurities tend to promote discoloration and clumping; therefore this type of sugar is generally limited to local consumption.|$|E

When local farmers have a bad harvest, the Hillsboro economy can also suffer. In turn, when the harvest is good, Hillsboro usually prospers. One of the more obvious effects the agricultural community has had on Hillsboro is found at the American <b>Crystal</b> <b>Sugar</b> sugar beet plant directly north of town. The large plant, located on U.S. Highway 81, has been responsible for both an increase in population and a steady stream of available jobs during the last few decades that it has been open.|$|E

Sugar beet growing {{requires}} {{a significant amount of}} difficult manual labor, and immigration restrictions on Europeans during the time limited their availability to work in the United States. Additionally, Mexican labor was desired because of their strong work ethic and acceptance of lower wages. Consequently, Mexicans were recruited by the American Beet Sugar Company (American <b>Crystal</b> <b>Sugar</b> Company) from Mexico and the southwestern states to work in the north central part of the state, especially around Mason City. For many of the same reasons that Mexicans were recruited to work in the sugar beet industry, they were also recruited to work on the railroads in Iowa. Many of the Mexicans recruited to work on the railroads established communities at Fort Madison, Council Bluffs, Des Moines, and Davenport. Additionally, a significant revolution in Mexico in 1910 led more Mexicans to emigrate, and ultimately arrive in Iowa.|$|E

30|$|The sugar {{industry}} comprises of large complex engineering systems arranged in series, parallel, {{or a combination}} of both. Some of these systems are feeding, crushing, refining, steam generation, evaporation, crystallization, etc. The crystallization unit {{is one of the most}} important functionary units of a sugar plant where the <b>sugar</b> <b>crystals</b> are formed. The concentrated juice available in the form of thick syrup from refining unit is heated slowly for long time at low temperature condition resulting into the formation of crystals called crystallization process. The semi-solid juice from the cooking pans of refining unit is first fed to the crystallizers arranged in parallel. Now, the juice mixture consisting of yellowish <b>sugar</b> <b>crystals</b> is suspended in a semi solid mass (molasses or magma). This mixture is processed in centrifuges to separate the <b>sugar</b> <b>crystals</b> from magma. These yellowish <b>sugar</b> <b>crystals</b> are treated chemically to yield white crystals, whereas crystal-free magma is recycled through sulphitors for more recovery. The <b>sugar</b> <b>crystals</b> are then sent to the grading unit, which comprises of a hopper, elevator, cooler, and grader, arranged in series.
