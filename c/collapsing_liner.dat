50|$|Some anti-armour {{projectiles}} {{use what}} is known as a shaped charge to defeat their target. Shaped charges have been used ever since it was discovered that a block of high explosives with letters engraved in it created perfect impressions of those letters when detonated against a piece of metal. A shaped charge is an explosive charge with a hollow lined cavity at one end and a detonator at the other. They operate by the detonating high explosive collapsing the (often copper) liner into itself. Some of the <b>collapsing</b> <b>liner</b> goes on to form a constantly stretching jet of material travelling at hypersonic speed. When detonated at the correct standoff to the armour, the jet violently forces its way through the target's armour.|$|E
40|$|Prevention {{of damage}} to the teat and {{mastitis}} requires determination of the teat load caused by a <b>collapsing</b> <b>liner.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to test a pressure-indicating film designed to measure the pressure between a <b>collapsing</b> <b>liner</b> and artificial teats. The Ultra Super Low and the Extreme Low pressure-indicating films were tested on two types of artificial teat. The experiments were performed with a conventional milking cluster equipped with round silicone liners. For each teat and film type, 30 repetitions were performed. Each repetition was performed with a new piece of film. Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to detect differences between the pressure values for the different teats. The area of regions where pressure-indication color developed was calculated to determine the most suitable film type. Both film types measured the pressure applied to both artificial teats by the teat cup liner. Thus, the pressure-indicating films can be used to measure the pressure between a <b>collapsing</b> <b>liner</b> and an artificial teat. Based on the results of the present investigation, a pressure-indicating film with the measurement ranges of both film types combined would be an optimal tool to measure the overall pressure between an artificial teat and a <b>collapsing</b> <b>liner...</b>|$|E

This effort extends traditional 1 -dimensional <b>liner</b> <b>collapse</b> to 2 -dimentional manipulation and energy control of the jetting mechanism. Various confinement conditions were explored to induce non-concentric <b>liner</b> <b>collapse</b> conditions and produce planar jet structures. Symmetric, but non-uniform confinement produced 2 -dimensional ‘spreading jets’ that have utility in cutting metal plates, pipe cutting, demolition and/or demilitarization of outdated or hazardous ordnance scenarios. First, parametric studies were numerically conducted to scope confinement thickness, confinement material, and the uniformity in circumferential coverage. Then, configurations were selected to best cover the design space and physical experiments were carried out with dual- orthogonal flash radiography. Lastly, the results were compared to the numerical simulations and analysis was conducted to examine the mechanism for mass re-distribution and extraction of the physics from explosive loading, its reflections off the non-uniform case, and <b>liner</b> <b>collapse</b> and jetting process. Three shots were conducted using the Viper liner and the steel thickness of 5. 5 mm since it provided the maximum confinement effect. The three shots examined the following gap sizes of 30 °, 60 °, and 90 °, and confirmed the numerical predictions of increasing radial expansion with gap size. The integrated approach of numerical modeling and experimental validation resulted in a higher fidelity insight into the complex jetting mechanism for improved future designs...|$|R

Upon consideration of the detonation front propagation along the lateral length of the core charge in LSCs (linear shaped charges), a further modification of the Birkhoff theory motivated by the unique geometrical condition of LSCs and the α = β condition is necessary to correctly describe the jetting behavior of LSCs which is different than that of CSCs (conical shaped charges). Based on such unique geometrical properties of LSCs, the original Birkhoff theory was modified and an analytical steady state LSCs model was built. The analytical model was then compared to the numerical simulation results created from Autodyn™ in terms of M/C ratio and apex angles in three different sized LSCs, and it exhibits favorable results in a limited range...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLining {{internally}} {{a carbon}} steel pipe {{with a thin}} layer of corrosion resistant material is an economical method for protecting offshore tubulars from the corrosive ingredients of hydrocarbons. In applications involving severe plastic bending, such as in the reeling installation process, the liner can detach from the outer pipe and develop large amplitude buckles that compromise the flow. This paper outlines a numerical framework for establishing the extent to which lined pipe can be bent before <b>liner</b> <b>collapse.</b> The modeling starts with the simulation of the inflation process through which the two tubes develop interference contact pressure. Bending the composite structure leads to differential ovalization and eventually separation of part of the liner from the outer pipe. The unsupported strip of the liner on the compressed side first wrinkles and at higher curvature buckles and collapses in a diamond shaped mode. The sensitivity of the collapse curvature to the various parameters of the problem is studied, and amongst other findings the onset of collapse is shown to be very sensitive to small geometric imperfections in the liner. It is also demonstrated that bending the pipe under modest amounts of internal pressure can delay <b>liner</b> <b>collapse</b> to curvatures that make it reelable...|$|R

To insure that a high-fusion yield occurs, a sequence of dynamic processes must be precisely timed, based on design parameters for the pinch configuration. For example, the total mass of the system must be adjusted in order that the compression occur near the time of peak current, the initial diameter of the pinch must not be so large that it becomes uncontrollably unstable before reaching the axis, the initial thickness of the liner must be small enough that the pinch may obtain a mm final diameter, yet thick enough that the azimuthal-magnetic field does not simply penetrate through the liner before implosion occurs, etc.|$|R

40|$|In {{addition}} to its various military applications, shaped charges {{have been used in}} oil industry as an oil well perforator (OWP) to connect oil and gas to their reservoirs. The <b>collapse</b> of the <b>liner</b> material under the explosive load produces a hypervelocity jet capable of achieving a deep penetration tunnel into the rock formation. The achieved penetration depends on the OWP design, which includes the geometry and the material of the explosive and the liner as well as the initiation mode and the casing of the shaped charge. The main purpose of this research is to assess the performance of OWP with different design aspects in terms of its penetration depth into concrete material. This research employed the Autodyn finite difference code to model the behaviour of OWPs in the stages of <b>liner</b> <b>collapse,</b> jet formation and jet penetration. The design parameters of OWPs were studied quantitatively to identify the effect of each individual parameter on the jet characteristics and the jet penetration depth into concrete material according to the API-RP 43 standard test configuration. In order to validate the Autodyn jetting analysis, this research compared the jetting simulation results of copper OWP liners with those obtained from flash x-ray measurements while the numerical jet penetration into the laminated concrete target was validated experimentally by the static firing of OWPs. Above-mentioned experiments were designed and performed in this project. The validated hydrocode was implemented in this research to study the effects of the concrete target strength, the liner material and the liner shape on the jet penetration depth into concrete targets. For the target strength, the traditional virtual origin (VO) penetration model was modified to include a strength reduction term based on Johnson’s damage number and the effect of the underground confinement pressure using Drucker-Prager model. The VO analytical model is also implemented in the liner material study to account for the jet density reduction phenomena and its induced reduction of jet penetration capability. The jets obtained from machined copper and zirconium liners and from copper-tungsten powder liner all exhibited the density reduction phenomena. The modified VO model considers the non-uniform distribution of jet density based on the jet profile analysis using Autodyn and the experimental soft recovery for some tested liners. The results lead to a modified VO penetration model including the non-uniform jet density effect. For zirconium liner material, numerical and analytical studies were conducted for different flow velocities and different collapse angles {{in order to determine the}} boundaries between the jetting and non-jetting phases and whether a coherent or a non-coherent jet will form. This study indicated that the suggested four different liner shapes (i. e. the conical, the biconical, the hemispherical and the bell) will produce coherent jet when the zirconium is used as OWP liner. The validated Autodyn hydrocode is also used in this thesis to calculate the velocity difference between two neighbouring zirconium jet fragments. The velocity difference is related directly to the breakup time of an OWP jet, and thus, it is calculated for a range of zirconium liners with different liner wall thicknesses. The calculated values of velocity difference gave a clear insight for the breakup time formulae for zirconium jet in terms of the liner thickness and the charge diameter.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 144 - 147). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A numerical and analytical model was constructed to determine the resultant stress state imposed on a Rock Melt Drill produced liner. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if the liner produced would possess the strength required to prevent a failure in the borehole wall. Derivation of energy, mass and momentum conservation equations was performed to aid in the identification of applicable loads acting on the melted material that will form the liner. A finite difference model was coded to produce a temperature profile in the liner thickness. An analytical stress model, using the results of the derived equations and the numerical thermal model, was constructed to determine the magnitude of the stresses the liner is subjected to after operation of the Rock Melt Drill. By using values from the Rock Melt Drill design and formation material properties taken from the literature, from experiment and through calculations, a baseline resultant stress was able to be determined for the liner. Utilizing the thermal and stress model, a parametric analysis of the stresses and temperature profile was conducted over a range of Rock Melt Drill operational parameters and formation material property parameters. This parametric analysis was conducted to determine trends between the above parameters and the resultant temperature and stress profiles. It was determined that the liner would have enough strength to prevent failure by collapse up to the required depths of 5 km, under ideal conditions. Additional loads applied to the liner in the form of an increase pressure gradient or formation fluid load may be enough to cause <b>collapse</b> of the <b>liner.</b> Also, the resultant tensile stress in the liner at shallow depths is great enough to cause crack propagation near the surface. It is a conclusion of this study that the Rock Melt Drill may be a potentially viable drilling system for use on Mars, in terms of preventing borehole collapse.

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringBP’s Skarv {{field is}} a stacked three layer {{reservoir}} structure. The field development plan involves drilling deviated and horizontal wells into the uppermost reservoir layer, Garn, and the lowermost reservoir layer, Tilje. Above Garn {{is a high}} pressure zone, that requires 1. 59 sg mud weight to be drilled. When Garn {{have proven to be}} a strong formation, the overburden and Garn is drilled as one section in Skarv drilling phase 1 to reach Tilje. A 9 7 / 8 ” shoe is set in top Tilje and the reservoir section in Tilje is drilled with an 8 ½” bit and left open hole and completed with gravel pack. The drainage strategy involves pressure support in Tilje, hence Garn will deplete with a faster rate. In phase 2 Garn will have depleted to an extent that drilling with 1. 59 mud will become a to large overbalance regarding differential sticking issues. The 9 7 / 8 ” shoe must therefore be set in top Garn. Due to the low pressure in Garn, Garn must be sealed off before drilling Tilje to avoid crossflow from Tilje into Garn. Garn and Ile, the middle sand, will be drilled with an 8 ½” bit. Traditionally a 7 ” liner will be set between top Garn and top Tilje. This will give a slim hole solution in the Tilje reservoir section which can lead to insufficient gravel packing resulting in hole collapse. It was proposed that expandable liner could be the solution to maintain an 8 ½” hole in Tilje. Available solutions for Skarv have been identified and Expandable liners from two vendors, Enventure GT’s SET® open hole liner and Baker Hughes linEXX™ monobore liner have been analyzed in StressCheck for installation, drilling and production loads an expandable liner could possible need to endure through the life off the well. Skarv’s J- 4 well, Skarv basis of design, Skarv casing design, NORSOK and BP internal regulations are used to set up a model in StressCheck. Expandables are special tubulars that are expanded down hole by mechanically or hydraulically pushing or pulling a cone or mandrel through the tubular. beyond the yield point, permanently deforming the pipe. When undergoing such expansion the mechanical properties of the pipes are changed. To gain a complete picture of what load scenarios the expandable must endure, the expandables were modeled both as pre- and post expanded. The analysis includes five different pressure regimes and four different mud weights as drilling and displacement fluids. Pressure regimes were calculated based on the expected depletion rate in Garn and mud weight were calculated based on minimum required mud weight in relation to well stability. Output from the analysis are safety factors, SF. For Skarv, minimum required SF for burst and collapse loads are 1. 10 and 1. 00 for collapse. In general, the limiting factor for an expandable is the collapse strength. The results however show that the limiting factors for depleted Garn is related to the burst loading, when the liners internal pressure which is the weight of the mud and the applied surface pressure, as in a pressure test, will exceed the low external reservoir pressure. For the 7. 625 X 9 7 / 8 ” SET® liner, the minimum SF was 0. 93 for burst and 2. 35 for collapse. For the 8. 625 X 10 3 / 4 ” SET® liner, the minimum SF was 0. 88 for burst and 2. 02 for <b>collapse.</b> For linEXX™ <b>liner</b> was 0. 73 for burst and 1. 32 for collapse. For all cases it was the high test pressure and injection pressures that casued the low SF. The internal pressure in a well is the pressure that can be controlled, which propose that expandables are a god solution for depleted reservoirs. By designing the well parameters to ensure the liners burst limit will not be exceeded, by e. g. tailor making the mud weight, expandable liner can be installed in Skarv wells. The expandables are not easily modeled in StressCheck when it proved challenging to ensure the correct properties are input for the pre- and post-expanded pipes and combining the two. For StressCheck to be a reliable tool for expandables, vendor should supply exact numbers or a range for both the pre-and post-expansion properties as the input variables required in StressCheck.
