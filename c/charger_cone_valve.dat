40|$|The thesis aims to {{determine}} the influence partial or complete submerge of hollow <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> by outflow on its capacity without space restrictions, by outflow into discharge chamber and by outflow into water tunnel of circular cross section. The valve capacity is for mutual comparability purposes usually characterized by discharge coefficient. Research works have been performed on a spatial hydraulic model of the valve with inlet diameter D = 67 mm and an apex angle of a cone 90 °. Values of the discharge coefficient obtained from measurements were statistically analyzed. The dependence of discharge coefficient, expressed by energy head, on submerged level was approximated by an exponential function. Exponent value of this function express the dependance rate of valve capacity on downstream water level. This procedure didn’t demonstrate signifiant dependance downstream water level on hollow <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> capacity, only on tests at outflow to water tunel showed a low increase in the discharge coefficient {{partly due to the}} influence of kinetic energy of the stream flowing out of the tunnel on the energy head and also due to underpressure. Independence of discharge coefficient value on valve head has been prooved for head greather than 232 mm. Also was defined 3 stages of interaction outflow jet from valve and downstream water, some of them may cause on real waterworks structures unfavorable situations (may affect excessive load on valve by pressure pulsations). The presented results allow better evaluation of bottom outlets capacity at higher water levels, when the valves are flooded. Significant effect of sufficient aeration (especially in long water tunnels) on valve capacity was also confirmed.

50|$|<b>Cone</b> <b>valves</b> or {{ball valves}} are another alternative. These are {{commonly}} found as the service shut-off valves in more-expensive water systems and usually found in gas taps (and, incidentally, the cask beer taps referred to above). They {{can be identified}} by their range of motion—only 90°—between fully open and closed. Usually, when the handle {{is in line with}} the pipe the valve is open, and when the handle is across the pipe it is closed. A <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> consists of a shallowly tapering cone in a tight-fitting socket placed across the flow of the fluid. In UK English this is usually known as a taper-plug cock. A ball valve uses a spherical ball instead. In either case, a hole through the cone or ball allows the fluid to pass if it is lined up with the openings in the socket through which the fluid enters and leaves; turning the cone using the handle rotates the passage away, presenting the fluid with the unbroken surface of the cone through which it cannot pass. Valves of this type using a cylinder rather than a cone are sometimes encountered, but using a cone allows a tight fit to be made even with moderate manufacturing tolerances. The ball in ball valves rotates within plastic seats.|$|R

In the research has been defined the automodeling area of outlet jet diversion from valve axis for different remoteness between water surface level and valve. The outflow jet diversion angle from valve axis has been measured in relation with relative valve opening. The coefficient of outflow has been specified in relation with relative valve opening. Furthermore, it has been searched for the position of discharge plane, where the discharging is done without backsplash. The last part of model tests was the discharge effect evaluation of most used chamber shapes.

40|$|Abstract. At long standoff, a shaped <b>charge</b> {{with small}} <b>cone</b> angle {{will produce a}} jet with a high tip {{velocity}} and a low tail velocity, causing it to stretch and break up, so its penetration ability into multilayer metal targets is very weak, while the penetration depth of explosively formed projectiles is too low to penetrate into multilayer metal targets. On account of this, the large <b>cone</b> angle shaped <b>charge,</b> whose internal <b>cone</b> angle is about 100 degree, is proposed and designed in the paper. The sensitivity of penetration effect into targets to the cone angle of the liner is investigated by experiment.

In numerical simulation, based on interface tracking algorithm known as markers on cell line to reconstruct material interfaces, jet penetration into metal targets is simulated in a two-dimensional multi-material Eulerian code.

40|$|The {{vortex tube}} or Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube is {{a device that}} enables the {{separation}} of hot and cold air as compressed air flows tangentially into the vortex chamber through inlet nozzles. Separating cold and hot airs by using {{the principles of the}} vortex tube can be applied to industrial applications such as cooling equipment in CNC machines, refrigerators, cooling suits, heating processes, etc. The vortex tube is well-suited for these applications because it is simple, compact, light, quiet, and does not use Freon or other refrigerants (CFCs/HCFCs). It has no moving parts and does not break or wear and therefore requires little maintenance. Thus, this paper presents an overview of the phenomena occurring inside the vortex tube during the temperature/energy separation on both the counter flow and parallel flow types. The paper also reviews the experiments and the calculations presented in previous studies on temperature separation in the vortex tube. The experiment consisted of two important parameters, the first is the geometrical characteristics of the vortex tube (for example, the diameter and length of the hot and cold tubes, the diameter of the cold orifice, shape of the hot (divergent) tube, number of inlet nozzles, shape of the inlet nozzles, and shape of the <b>cone</b> <b>valve.</b> The second is focused on the thermo-physical parameters such as inlet gas pressure, cold mass fraction, moisture of inlet gas, and type of gas (air, oxygen, helium, and methane). For each parameter, the temperature separation mechanism and the flow-field inside the vortex tubes is explored by measuring the pressure, velocity, and temperature fields. The computation review is concentrated on the quantitative, theoretical, analytical, and numerical (finite volume method) aspects of the study. Although many experimental and numerical studies on the vortex tubes have been made, the physical behaviour of the flow is not fully understood due to its complexity and the lack of consistency in the experimental findings.

40|$|Electrospray {{ionization}} {{mass spectrometry}} (ESIMS) {{is widely used}} to characterize neutral and ionic species in solvents. Typically, electrical, thermal, and pneumatic potentials are applied to create electrosprays from which charged ionic species are ejected for downstream analysis by mass spectrometry. Most recently, ESIMS has been exploited to investigate ambient proton transfer reactions at air-water interfaces in real time. We assessed the validity of these experiments via complementary laboratory experiments. Specifically, we characterized the products of two reaction scenarios via ESIMS and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H-NMR) : (i) emulsions of pH-adjusted water and isoprene (C 5 H 8) that were mechanically agitated, and (ii) electrosprays of pH-adjusted water that were collided with gas-phase isoprene. Our experiments unambiguously demonstrate that, while isoprene does not oligomerize in emulsions, it does undergo protonation and oligomerization in electrosprays, both with and without pH-adjusted water, confirming that C-C bonds form along myriad high-energy pathways during electrospray ionization. We also compared our experimental results with some quantum mechanics simulations of isoprene molecules interacting with hydronium at different hydration levels (gas versus liquid phase). In agreement with our experiments, the kinetic barriers to protonation and oligomerization of isoprene were inaccessible under ambient conditions. Rather, the gas-phase chemistries during electrospray ionization drove the oligomerization of isoprene. Therefore, we consider that ESIMS could induce artifacts in interfacial reactions. These findings warrant a reassessment of previous reports on tracking chemistries under ambient conditions at liquid-vapor interfaces via ESIMS. Further, we took some high-speed images of electrosprays where {{it was possible to}} observe the main characteristics of the phenomena, i. e.

The posterior area of the posterior interstitial ring, the pyloric cone and the pyloric valve did not reveal any traces of infection by BmMNPV and, thus, resistance mechanisms involving genetic factors could be acting. The knowledge obtained from this work will contribute in the establishment of the infectious cycle of this important entomopathogenic virus, which may lead to an epizootic that can negatively affect the whole productive chain of sil...|$|R
