5|$|Argentina {{regularly}} receives {{cold air}} from the south that can reach low latitudes owing {{to the influence of}} the Andes. Cold waves are usually accompanied with severe snowstorms or extremely <b>cold</b> <b>conditions</b> that can have a devastating impact on the country's economy. These snowstorms and/or extremely <b>cold</b> <b>conditions</b> can partially or completely paralyze activities in large areas of Patagonia and the center of the country. In addition, <b>cold</b> <b>conditions</b> can lead to energy shortages during the winter months due to increased demand. The low temperatures brought by these cold waves can cause frosts that can damage plants, severely affecting agricultural production and devastating the local economy.|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{effects on}} the nest sizes {{constructed}} by Polistes riparius foundresses, their nesting activities, and colony compositions were determined in labora-tory conditions during the pre-emergence period. In this study, foundresses were placed in cold (20 °C) and warm conditions (27 °C), and ample food and nest materials were supplied. Nest sizes were larger in the cold condition; particularly, the elongation of cells was remarkable. The number of cells be-tween the 2 conditions was not significantly different. Inter-condition colony composition was similar, while more honey drops were observed in the <b>cold</b> <b>condition</b> nests. A positive relation was observed when the relationships between body weight and developmental days were investigated, i. e., small offspring required shorter developmental days in both thermal <b>conditions.</b> In the <b>cold</b> <b>condition,</b> the first offspring were very small, whereas offspring size increased steeply after the second order, and was {{comparable to that of}} the foundresses; the size increase in the warm group was slight. This result indicates that the <b>cold</b> <b>condition</b> foundresses manipulated the sizes of their offspring. When inter-condition foundresses activities were compared, <b>cold</b> <b>condition</b> foundresses spent more time and energy on flight activities. These results support the view that foundresses change nesting activities in relation to environmental temperatures, i. e., they can improve the thermal condition of nests by adding extra cells and manipulate the sizes of adult offspring...|$|R
5|$|While on orbit, Challenger made {{a number}} of {{altitude}} and attitude adjustments, in order to test the behavior of a Shuttle orbiter and to perform some experiments in different thermal conditions.

5|$|Octopus blood {{contains}} the copper-rich protein haemocyanin to transport oxygen. This makes the blood very viscous {{and it requires}} considerable pressure to pump it round the body; octopuses' blood pressures can exceed 75 mmHg. In <b>cold</b> <b>conditions</b> with low oxygen levels, haemocyanin transports oxygen more efficiently than haemoglobin. The haemocyanin is dissolved in the plasma instead of being carried within blood cells, and gives the blood a bluish colour.|$|E
5|$|Early on 10 April, Pukovnik Franjo Nikolić, {{the head}} of the {{operations}} staff with the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, left his post and visited the senior Ustaše leader Slavko Kvaternik in Zagreb. He then returned to headquarters and redirected 4th Army units around Zagreb to either cease operations or to deploy to innocuous positions. These actions reduced or eliminated armed resistance to the German advance. On the same day, the 14th Panzer Division, supported by dive bombers, crossed the Drava and drove southwest towards Zagreb on snow-covered roads in extremely <b>cold</b> <b>conditions.</b> Initial air reconnaissance indicated large concentrations of Yugoslav troops on the divisional axis of advance, but these troops proved to be withdrawing towards Zagreb.|$|E

5|$|Norfolk has a {{long history}} of human occupation. Both modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000years ago, before the last glaciation, and humans {{returned}} as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the then prevailing very <b>cold</b> <b>conditions,</b> but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic (10,000–5,000BCE), the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are now under the sea in an area now known as Doggerland.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, the 14th Panzer Division of XLVI Motorised Corps, {{supported}} by dive bombers, crossed the Drava at Gyékényes and drove southwest towards Zagreb on snow-covered roads in extremely <b>cold</b> <b>conditions.</b> Initial air reconnaissance indicated large concentrations of Yugoslav {{troops on the}} divisional axis of advance, but these troops proved to be withdrawing towards Zagreb. Degraded by revolt and fifth-column activity, the 27th Infantry Division Savska numbered about 2,000 effectives when the German attack began. The 14th Panzer Division vanguard reached their positions around 08:00, and {{the remnants of the}} division began withdrawing under heavy air attack. Around 14:00, the Yugoslavs were quickly encircled by German motorised troops that had outflanked them. The divisional headquarters staff escaped, but were captured a little further down the road. The remnants of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment had to fight its way towards Bjelovar, but was attacked by German tanks on the outskirts, captured and detained.

Similarly, ME 9 and ME 17 were heat-specific Eigen genes only in shoot samples. Four Eigen genes (ME 2, ME 6, ME 12, and ME 18) were identified as salt-specific only in root samples. Two Eigen genes, ME 4 and ME 11, were identified as salt-specific and heat-specific, respectively, in both root and shoot tissues.|$|R

5|$|The European Winter of 1941-1942 was {{the coldest}} {{of the twentieth}} century. On 30 November, von Bock {{reported}} to Berlin that the temperature was –45 °C (–49 °F). General Erhard Raus, commander of the 6th Panzer Division, kept track of the daily mean temperature in his war diary. It shows a suddenly much colder period during 4–7 December: from –36 to –38 °C (–37 to –38 °F). Other temperature reports varied widely. Zhukov said that November's freezing weather stayed around –7 to –10°C (+19 to +14°F) Official Soviet Meteorological Service records show the lowest December temperature reached –28.8°C (–20°F). These numbers indicated severely <b>cold</b> <b>conditions,</b> and German troops were freezing with no winter clothing, using equipment that was not designed for such low temperatures. More than 130,000 cases of frostbite were reported among German soldiers. Frozen grease {{had to be removed}} from every loaded shell and vehicles had to be heated for hours before use. The same cold weather, typical for the season, hit the Soviet troops, but they were better prepared.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} 2008 {{athletics}} season saw Bolt {{compete in}} the ÅF Golden League, beginning in Weltklasse Zürich. Despite having the slowest start among his competitors in the 100 m race, he still crossed the finishing line in 9.83 s. Even though the time was slower than both his newly set world record and Asafa Powell's track record, it was still among the top-fifteen 100 m finishes by any sprinter to that date. Bolt admitted {{that he was not}} running at full strength, suffering from a cold, but he had concentrated on both winning the race and finishing the season in good health. At the Super Grand Prix final in Lausanne, Bolt ran his second-fastest 200 m with a time of 19.63 s, equalling Xavier Carter's track record. However, it was the 100 m final, featuring Asafa Powell, that drew the most interest. Powell had moved closer to Bolt's world record after setting a new personal best of 9.72 s, reaffirming his status as Bolt's main contender. Bolt's final event of the season came three days later at the Golden League final in Brussels. This was the first 100 m race featuring both Bolt and Powell since the final in the Olympics. Both Jamaicans broke the track record, but Bolt came out on top with a time of 9.77 s, beating Powell by 0.06 s. Victory, however, did not come as smoothly as it had in Beijing. Bolt made the slowest start of the nine competitors and had to recover ground in <b>cold</b> <b>conditions</b> and against a 0.9m/s headwind. Yet the results confirmed Jamaican dominance in the 100 m, with nine of the ten-fastest legal times in history being recorded by either Bolt or Powell.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{individuals}} in a colony varies. A mature nest of several years old can hold between 11,000 and 64,000 ants, while other colonies can house around 300,000. In some cases, enormous colonies can {{have as many as}} a million ants. Observed colonies are known to contain nearly 70,000 larvae and 64,000 workers; some can have 20,000 males and over 1,000 virgin queens, but others may have more virgin queens than males. The ratio of worker ants to the number of the larvae in colonies ranges from one worker for every two larvae or two larvae for every worker. The population of a nest can be affected or altered by several factors: human interference can severely damage or completely destroy nests which potentially devastates the nest population, and overshadowing is the main cause of a nest's demise. As well as that, neighbouring nests may increase in population if damaged or abandoned sites are taken over. Meat ants also rely on their nests to withstand climatic stress in summer and winter, as foraging activity and food sources are sometimes limited in summer, and in winter plant growth is almost impossible and workers are unable to survive cold temperatures. As a result, meat ants overwinter, which is a process where some organisms wait out the winter season due to <b>cold</b> <b>conditions</b> making everyday activity and survivability almost impossible; populations may be affected greatly.|$|E

40|$|The {{advantages}} and disadvantages of using <b>cold</b> plasma <b>conditions</b> in combination with both the standard and the high-transmission ('jet') plasma interface and under dry and wet plasma conditions were evaluated in the context of high-precision isotopic analysis of Fe via multi-collector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). When using the standard interface and wet plasma, <b>cold</b> plasma <b>conditions</b> suppressed the occurrence of the polyatomic ions (ArN+) -Ar- 40 -N- 14 and (ArO+) -Ar- 40 -O- 16, but not that of (ArOH+) -Ar- 40 -O- 16 -H- 1. Dry plasma conditions efficiently removed the (hydr) oxide ions, but at the cost of a dramatic increase in the prevalence of 40 Ar 14 N+. Thus, interference-free Fe- 56 /Fe- 57 measurement can be performed at low mass resolution using <b>cold</b> plasma <b>conditions</b> and the standard plasma interface. No alleviation of the spectral interferences due to Ar-based ions was observed with the 'jet' interface with <b>cold</b> plasma <b>conditions.</b> With <b>cold</b> plasma <b>conditions,</b> the instrumental mass discrimination affecting the Fe isotope ratios was mitigated compared to that obtained with hot plasma when the standard interface was used (1. 4 % per amu versus 3. 2 % per amu, respectively). This mitigation in instrumental mass discrimination with <b>cold</b> plasma <b>conditions</b> was not observed when the high-transmission interface was used...|$|R
