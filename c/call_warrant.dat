40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the responses of}} the different types of investors on stock rating change announcements made by investment banks around <b>call</b> <b>warrant</b> issuances in Taiwan. The unique characteristics of the Taiwan warrants market allow investment banks to make stock rating change announcements around <b>call</b> <b>warrant</b> issuances for the same stocks they rate. In Taiwan, investment banks are also dealers of call warrants, and thus, the profit and loss results from their warrant business are potentially in conflict-of-interest for their stock ratings. Another feature of the Taiwan stock market allows us to disentangle the types of investors initiating the stock trades. We identify three types of investors: institutional investors, experienced retail investors, and ordinary retail investors. Our findings suggest that institutional investors are able to "see-through" the conflict-of-interest in investment banks; experienced investors are able to partially "see-through" the conflict-of-interest, and ordinary retail investors are unable to "see-through" the conflict-of-interest of investment banks.

40|$|Since 1998, large {{investment}} banks have become active as issuers of options, generally {{referred to as}} <b>call</b> <b>warrants</b> or bank-issued options. This {{has led to an}} interesting situation in the Netherlands, where simultaneously <b>call</b> <b>warrants</b> are traded on the stock exchange, and long-term call options are traded on the options exchange. Both entitle their holders to buy shares of common stock. We start with a direct comparison between <b>call</b> <b>warrants</b> and <b>call</b> options, written on the same stock and with the same exercise price, but where the call option has a longer time to maturity. In 13 out of 16 cases we find that the <b>call</b> <b>warrants</b> are priced higher, which is a clear violation of basic option pricing rules. In {{the second part of the}} analysis we use option pricing models to compare the pricing of <b>call</b> <b>warrants</b> and <b>call</b> options. If implied standard deviations from options are used to price the <b>call</b> <b>warrants</b> we find that the <b>call</b> <b>warrants</b> are strongly overpriced during the first five trading days. The average overpricing is between 25 and 30 percent. Only a small part of the overpricing can be explained by rational arguments such as transaction costs.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the price performance of call warrants in China's securities market. A recent sample of daily <b>call</b> <b>warrant</b> prices observed {{during the period}} from August 2005 to March 2007 is used. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the only recent study to using data from China and as such it greatly enhances our understanding of this particular market. On average, we find that the observed market prices are irrationally higher than the Black-Scholes model prices by 80. 38 % (using 180 -day historical volatility) and 140. 50 % (using EGARCH volatility). However, we find another anomalous phenomenon that some of the call warrants prices are not only lower than the model prices, but have also recently been anomalously under their lower bounds. This finding seems to violate the "no arbitrage" principle. Among the convincing reasons, our findings indicate that trading mechanism constraints in China's securities market prevent rational investors from driving the prices of these call warrants to a reasonable level. Arbitrage chances are found to exist in some specific cases when the <b>call</b> <b>warrant</b> prices are below their lower bounds. <b>Call</b> <b>warrant,</b> Black-Scholes model, EGARCH model, "under the lower bound" puzzle, arbitrage...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} pricing of Dutch index warrants. It is {{found that when}} using the {{historical}} standard deviation as an estimate for the volatility, the Black and Scholes model underprices all put <b>warrants</b> and <b>call</b> <b>warrants</b> on the FT-SE 100 and the CAC 40, while it overprices the <b>call</b> <b>warrants</b> on the DAX. When the implied volatility of the previous day is used the model prices the index warrants fairly well. When the historical standard deviation is used the mispricing of the call and the put warrants depends in a strong way on the mispricing of the previous trading day, and on the moneyness (in a non-linear way), the volatility, and the dividend yield. When the implied standard deviation of the previous trading day is used the mispricing of the <b>call</b> <b>warrants</b> is only related to the moneyness and to the estimated volatility, while the mispricing of put index warrants depends in a strong way on the moneyness, the volatility, the dividend yield and the remaining time to maturity.

40|$|By {{empirical}} studies of Chinese warrants pricing, we find there are systematic devi-ations in <b>warrants</b> price that <b>call</b> <b>warrants</b> are under valued and put warrants are over valued. Using high frequency data, we do further researches {{about the reasons}} of sys-tematic deviations according to the prospect theory and resell option theory owing to heterogeneous beliefs. The main reason caused the systematic deviations is the asym-metries in the risk exposure of warrants issuers. These asymmetries make the reference price of PT/MA investors low for <b>call</b> <b>warrants</b> issuers and high for put warrants issuers. These factors cause the systematic deviations in Chinese warrants. Individual specula-tion behaviors can explain only small parts of warrants price deviations. consequently, we think the main reason caused systematic price deviations is warrants creation mecha-nism, which create defective warrants, rather than only caused by individual investors’ speculative behaviors...|$|R

40|$|A deep-in-the-money <b>call</b> <b>warrant</b> and its {{underlying}} common share are two highly correlated financial assets. However, trading {{of these two}} assets is subject to different restrictions in China. Buyers of stock are subject to a one-day lock-up and cannot sell their shares until the next trading day, but warrant traders are free of such restrictions and may conduct day trading. This paper examines the non-marketability discount in stock prices due to the one-day trading lock-up. We demonstrate that the non-marketability discount is negatively correlated with stock liquidity (smaller discounts are associated with more liquid stocks) and positively correlated with warrant liquidity (bigger discounts are associated with more liquid warrants). Furthermore, as would be expected, intraday {{results show that the}} non-marketability discount decreases through the day as the time of the lock-up decreases. This unique market where two nearly identical assets are traded under different trading constraints enables us to directly measure the non-marketability discount, which is difficult to obtain in other markets. Our empirical conclusion supports the “portfolio claustrophobia ” theory of Longstaff (2009) with even a very short one-day lock-up window. The paper provides implications to value illiquid or nonmarketable assets...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we aim to}} trace {{the roots of the}} ongoing {{economic}} mayhem and to unmask the chorus of the tragedy which plays on the world stage. The main thesis of our work is that, despite the triumphant rhetoric praising the merits of perfect competition, the global fields of the dysfunctional market system have mushroomed in what we <b>call</b> <b>Warrant</b> Economics for the Free-Market Aristocracy. Warrant Economics unfolds in two symbiotic tenets that constitute the subtle architecture of the neoliberal edifice: (i) the systemic creation and preservation of inequality via Call-Put policy options, and (ii) the systemic exploitation of inequality via novel and toxic forms of securitisation. In effect, the power structure of insiders' capitalism that we describe, through the costless appropriation of an intricate cobweb of Call-Put structures, has distorted competition and accelerated economic concentration. We view the income distribution effect, which favours the top 1 %, and the business concentration effect, which gravitates competition towards oligopolistic/monopolistic industries, as {{the two sides of the}} Warrant Economics coin. We argue that the Warrant Economics state of capitalism has been legitimised by a degenerating research programme blossomed under the fallacy that economics is the "physics of society". In this faculty of thought, we perceive the Great Recession as a symptom of Warrant Economics, rather than as a tsunami-like event.

40|$|The first essay {{presents}} a closed-form pricing formula for a European <b>call</b> <b>warrant</b> issued by a leveraged firm and demonstrates {{there are significant}} pricing errors if the formula derived under the all-equity firm assumption in Schulz 2 ̆ 6 Trautmann (Journal of Banking and Finance, 1994) and the formula developed for pricing regular options in Black 2 ̆ 6 Scholes (Journal of Political Economy, 1973) are used to price such a warrant. The second essay is on pricing a Catastrophic Put Option (Cat-E-Put). A Cat-E-Put is a catastrophic event triggered equity option, designed as a post-loss refinancing tool for a primary insurance company. The objective {{of this paper is}} to develop a pricing formula that factors in both ‘feedback effect’ and ‘dilution effect 2 ̆ 7 ’ to the share price due to the exercise of the put. We successfully derive a pricing formula and illustrate in numerical examples that the failure to price a Cat-E-Put as on-your-own stock option (option written on buyer or seller 2 ̆ 7 s stock) could lead to relative pricing error in a factor close to the hedge ratio (the number of new shares to be issued upon the exercise of the Cat-E-Put divided by the number of current outstanding shares). The third essay is about time series modeling of temperature processes for weather derivatives pricing and it compares the performance of three classes of time series models. The fractional AR-GARCH model is favored in most of cases over another two models, AR-GARCH and fractional AR by AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion). We also use the three models to forecast densities of two weather indices. Relative to volatility calculated based on historical realized index values and volatilities based on simulated index values, AR-GARCH tends to give the lowest volatility estimate for each city and each index, with only two exceptions out of 20 cases considered. ...|$|E
