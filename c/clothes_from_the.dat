5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jack, {{responding}} to audience research, starts cleaning out green <b>clothes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> set. He asks Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), {{one of the}} stars of TGS, how old she is, and she tells him that she is 29. As a result of this exchange, Jenna gets botox and collagen injections that go terribly wrong. Later, during a sketch rehearsal—involving impersonations of Condoleezza Rice, Laura Bush, and John Kerry—the various mishaps of Tracy, Jenna, and Josh prompt Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) that it would be impossible for the three to perform on the show. Fortunately, the power in the NBC Studios goes out, canceling the show.|$|E

25|$|Virginia Rappe {{suffered}} from chronic cystitis, {{a condition that}} liquor irritated dramatically. Her heavy drinking habits and the poor quality of the era's bootleg alcohol could leave her in severe physical distress. She developed a reputation for over-imbibing at parties, then drunkenly tearing at her <b>clothes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> resulting physical pain. But {{by the time of}} the St. Francis Hotel party, her reproductive health was a greater concern. She had undergone several abortions in the space of a few years, the quality of care she received for such procedures was probably substandard, and she was preparing to undergo another (or, more likely, had recently done so) as a result of being impregnated by her boyfriend, director Henry Lehrman.|$|E

25|$|The {{trial was}} one of the most highly publicized in California history. The {{prosecution}} hypothesis was that Abbott had attempted to rape the victim and killed her when she resisted. Abbott pleaded not guilty. At the trial all the evidence produced was circumstantial and nothing directly connected Abbott with Stephanie Bryan's death. The prosecution used emotion to overcome the lack of direct evidence by such strategies as showing the jury the rotten <b>clothes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> victim's body and waving her brassiere and panties, making implications it could not prove. Abbott explained that in May, the basement of the house had been used as a polling site with many people having access. Although the prosecution charged attempted rape, the pathologist testified that the body was too decomposed to evaluate it for evidence of sexual assault.|$|E

They say their final goodbyes to Priya and Rani apologises for how she treated her. Priya's life support is then switched off. Five days later, Sonya wakes from her coma, but suffers some memory loss. Ajay launches a class action suit against Paul and the hotel. However, when it emerges the gas bottle had been faulty, Ajay launches a case against the manufactures instead. Weeks later, Sonya regains her memories during a vow renewal ceremony. She also remembers Mason and Robbo {{were involved in the}} robbery at Lassiter's and reports them to the police.|$|E
25|$|As {{everything}} {{had been done to}} help the passengers, and when nothing else could be done to save them, Mr Russell and people from all over Kilkee took in survivors from the disaster for the night. The next morning the extent of the disaster became apparent with bodies and wreckage strewn across the whole beach. As the day wore on it became known that of the 216 aboard, 98 lost their lives and 118 were saved. All day, bodies washed up on the beach and in the end 54 bodies were recovered. Most of the deceased were buried in the nearby Kilfiera graveyard. To help the survivors, a subscription was held with businessmen from all over Ireland and England contributing to it. In the end over £300 was raised, all going to the survivors and to the next of kin of the dead. As Ireland {{was in the middle of}} a famine, many poor people looted the ship, with some going as far as stripping the <b>clothes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dead.|$|E

[...] On December 23 the Aspen trial judge granted the request—but to Colorado Springs, where juries had historically been hostile to murder suspects. On the night of December 30, with most of the jail staff on Christmas break and nonviolent prisoners on furlough with their families, Bundy piled books and files in his bed, covered them with a blanket to simulate his sleeping body, and climbed into the crawlspace. He broke through the ceiling into the apartment of the chief jailer—who was out for the evening with his wife—changed into street <b>clothes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> jailer's closet, and walked out the front door to freedom.|$|E
500|$|In {{desiring}} {{to avoid}} stereotypes of the costume drama, Webber costumed his actors in simple outfits he termed [...] "period Prada," [...] rather than use the ruffles and baggy costumes common for the era. The {{intent was to}} [...] "... take the real <b>clothes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> period and reduce them to their essence." [...] Costume designer Dien van Straalen explored London and Holland markets in search for period fabrics, including curtains and slipcovers. For Griet, van Straalen employed [...] "... pale colors for Scarlett Johansson {{to give her the}} drab look of a poor servant girl." [...] Firth was also outfitted simply, as Vermeer was not rich. Van Straalen created more elaborate costumes for Wilkinson, as van Ruijven was to her [...] "... a peacock strutting around with his money." ...|$|E
500|$|Lochner's art seems {{indebted to}} two broad sources; Netherlandish artists van Eyck and Robert Campin, and the earlier German masters Conrad von Soest and the Master of Saint Veronica. From the former Lochner drew his realism in {{depicting}} naturalistic backgrounds, objects and <b>clothes.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> latter he adopted the somewhat antiquated manner of depicting figures, especially females, with doll-like, eloquent and sensitive features, to present [...] "iconic, almost timeless" [...] atmospheres, {{enhanced by the}} then old-fashioned gold backgrounds. Lochner's figures have idealised facial features typical of medieval portraiture. His subjects, females in particular, usually have the high foreheads, long noses, small rounded chins, tucked blond curls and prominent ears typical of the late Gothic, giving them the characteristic monumentality of 13th-century art, placing them on seemingly similar shallow backgrounds.|$|E

500|$|The set design, {{costumes and}} props took {{about two weeks}} to prepare. Warm worked {{primarily}} on the sets, while Röhrig handled the painting and Reimann {{was responsible for the}} costumes. Robinson noted the costumes in Caligari seem to resemble a wide variety of time periods. For example, Dr. Caligari and the fairground workers' costumes resemble the Biedermeier era, while Jane's embody Romanticism. Additionally, Robinson wrote, Cesare's costume and those of [...] policemen in the film appear abstract, while many of the other characters seem like ordinary German <b>clothes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1920s. The collaborative nature of the film's production highlights the importance that both screenwriters and set designers held in German cinema of the 1920s, although film critic Lotte H. Eisner said sets held more importance than anything else in German films at that time. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari was the first German Expressionist film, although Brockmann and film critic Mike Budd claims it was also influenced by German Romanticism; Budd notes the film's themes of insanity and the outcry against authority are common among German Romanticism in literature, theatre and the visual arts. Film scholar Vincent LoBrutto said the theatre of Max Reinhardt and the artistic style of Die Brücke were additional influences on Caligari.|$|E
500|$|Until {{the end of}} World War I, {{there was}} little change in the {{admission}} process at Kew. [...] Upon arriving, a variable amount of data was collected on the person being admitted. These basic details included age, sex, marital status and former address (or name of the asylum/jail transferred from). Other details requested included names of relatives or friends, the person's religion and occupation and whether others in the family have ever been classified as insane. Other information recorded, where available, were dates of previous admissions, [...] "form of mental disorder", bodily condition ("satisfactory", [...] "unsatisfactory", [...] "feeble", etc.) and [...] "duration of existing attack". [...] From approximately 1900 onwards, photographs were usually taken on admission. If the person was very restless, the photograph was omitted. [...] Belongings, such as books and clothes, were often returned to friends or family. [...] Inmates were required to dress in institutional clothes. This was useful {{in a number of}} ways as it assisted the public in easily identifying escaped inmates; reduced the need to request clothes (or money for <b>clothes)</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inmate's family or their estate; and minimised inmate conflict when inmates swapped or stole clothes from each other. The property and estates of people who were deemed to be insane were controlled and administered by the Master-in-Equity, also known as the Master-in-Lunacy.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour was}} divided into five segments, namely Cyber-Punk, Geisha, Cowgirl, Spanish and Ghetto. Each segment {{represented}} a phase of Madonna's career. Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg announced that the tour was designed as the grandest spectacle amongst all the other Madonna tours. Designer Jean-Paul Gaultier was signed up to create the costumes for the tour. He {{came up with the}} concept of creating the costumes of the tour as a fusion of punk and Scottish fashions. Other costumes designed by Gaultier had geisha, cowboy and Spanish themes in them. Other designers associated with the tour included Dean and Dan Caten, creaters of the DSquared2 fashion line. The dresses developed included a torn shirt and zippered black pants, indicating the early days of her career, and leather chapped jeans and ghetto fabulous costumes, indicating the phase of her career at that point of time. Black wigs and white makeup would demonstrate the Ray of Light and the geisha themes. A hybrid of <b>clothes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> music video of the Madonna song [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] (1987) and the 1996 Madonna starring musical Evita were also created. The setlist for the show consisted mainly of songs from the last two studio albums Ray of Light and Music.

500|$|During Jack's initial {{appearances}} in Doctor Who, Russell T Davies held a [...] "half-hearted" [...] theory that Jack would dress {{specific to the}} time period he was in, to contrast the Doctor who dresses the same wherever and whenever he goes. He is introduced wearing a greatcoat in World War II-set episodes, but changes to modern day jeans in contemporary episode [...] "Boom Town" [...] and black leather in futuristic episodes. Davies admits {{that this was a}} [...] "bit of a lame idea" [...] and decided that Jack [...] "never looked better than {{when he was in his}} World War II outfit". [...] From the pilot of Torchwood onwards, Harkness once again wears period military <b>clothes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> second World War, including braces and an officer's wool greatcoat in every appearance. Costume designer Ray Holman commented in a Torchwood Magazine interview that [...] "We always wanted to keep the World War Two hero look for him, so all his outfits have a 1940s flavour." [...] Because the character was expected to [...] "be running around a lot", Holman redesigned his RAF Group Captain's greatcoat from Doctor Who to make it more fluid and less [...] "weighty". Jack's other costumes are [...] "loosely wartime based", such as the trousers are [...] "getting more and more styled to suit his figure". Holman explains that there are actually five Captain Jack coats used on the show. The [...] "hero version" [...] is used for most scenes, while there is also a wetcoat made with pre-shrunk fabric, running coat which is slightly shorter to prevent heels getting caught, and two [...] "stunt coats" [...] that had been [...] "hero coats" [...] in the first series." [...] Davies feels the military uniform reinforces the idea that the character [...] "likes his Captain Jack Harkness identity". Julie Gardner describes the coat as [...] "epic and classic and dramatic", while director Brian Kelly believes it gives Jack [...] "a sweep and a presence".|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 15, 1910. It states: [...] "Little Marie Allen, a penniless orphan, lives with her granddad. Out for a walk she admires a huge doll in a shop window. That night, after her granddad has fallen asleep, she slips out to have {{another look at the}} doll. Arriving at the toy shop, she sees that the doll is gone. Unseen by anyone, she enters the store. She finds the wonderful doll and lifts it out of its box to admire it. Hearing a clerk approaching, she becomes frightened and gets into the doll box. The doll rolls under the counter. The clerk sends the errand boy off with the box, thinking it contains the doll, which has been ordered for Daisy Smythe, a rich little girl. Arriving at Daisy's house, Marie steps out of the box as soon as the room is empty. She removes the doll <b>clothes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> box and admires them greatly. She decides to try them on, and soon a little cap, shoes and garments are on her figure. Then she hears Daisy coming and retreats to the box. Daisy enters and takes the supposed doll from the box, falls in love with it instantly and enthusiastically works its arms and limbs. Marie lives up to her role well, imitating with stiff, jerky movements of the limbs that belong to real dolls. Then Daisy eats, and Marie grows hungry as she watches. When Daisy sets down her bowl of milk, Marie reaches over and drinks it down. Daisy is amazed when she misses the milk. Marie helps herself to all the food and Daisy's wonderment is amusing to see. Finally Daisy falls asleep in her chair and Marie falls asleep on the floor. Here she is found by her granddad, who managed to trace her from the toy shop, and Daisy and her mother laugh so heartily over Marie's adventure that they reward her cleverness with - the doll itself!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, a corset {{supports}} the visible dress and spreads {{the pressure from}} large dresses, such as the crinoline and bustle. At times, a corset cover is used to protect outer <b>clothes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> corset and to smooth {{the lines of the}} corset. The original corset cover was worn under the corset to provide a layer between it and the body. Corsets were not worn next to the skin, possibly due to difficulties with laundering these items during the 19th century, as they had steel boning and metal eyelets that would rust. The corset cover was generally {{in the form of a}} light chemise, made from cotton lawn or silk. Modern corset wearers may wear corset liners for many of the same reasons. Those who lace their corsets tightly use the liners to prevent burn on their skin from the laces.|$|E
