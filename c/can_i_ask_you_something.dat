He continues {{to stare at her}} as if she were a statue. [...] Miss Cross rubs her eyes and sighs. She sets down her red pen. She looks back to Max. He is still staring at her. [...] 1--Miss Cross tries to deter Max [...] MISS CROSS Max? [...] MAX Uh-huh? [...] MISS CROSS <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something?</b> [...] MAX Sure. [...] MISS CROSS Has it ever crossed your mind that you're far too young for me? [...] Max looks up. Miss Cross smiles faintly. Silence. [...] MAX It's crossed my mind that you might consider that a possibility, yes. [...] MISS CROSS Quite apart from the fact that you're a student— [...] 2--Max puts her on the defensive [...] MAX I'm not trying to pressure you into anything, Miss Cross. I'm surprised you brought it up so bluntly. [...] MISS CROSS I just want to make sure— [...] MAX We've become friends haven't we? [...] MISS CROSS Yes. [...] MAX Good. [...] Max thinks for a second, then presses on: [...] 3--Max presses on [...] MAX And, um, the truth is neither one of us has the slightest idea where this relationship is going. We can't predict the future. [...] MISS CROSS We don't have a relationship, Max. [...] MAX But we're friends. [...] MISS CROSS Yes. And that's all we're going to be. [...] MAX That's what I mean by relationship. You want me to grab a dictionary? [...] MISS CROSS I just want to make sure we understand each other. [...] MAX (defeated) I understand. You're not attracted to me. C'est la vie. [...] MISS CROSS Max. You're fifteen-years old. Attraction doesn't enter into it. [...] 4--Miss Cross softens [...] MAX If you say so. Look, all I'm getting at is I've never met anyone like you. So you can take that for whatever it's worth. [...] She thinks about this for a minute. [...] MISS CROSS I think I can safely say I've never met anyone like you either. [...] MAX You haven't, have you? [...] MISS CROSS (shakes her head) [...] 5--Max wins [...] MAX (quietly) You want to shake hands? [...] She puts out her hand and they shake hands across the desk. But they don't let go. They just look at each other. [...] MAX I'm glad we had this conversation. [...] MISS CROSS So am I. [...] They finally let go of each other's hands. Miss Cross looks away. She's not exactly sure what they just decided.|$|E

It also {{would not have}} been possible without the dedicated, committed and professional work of the men and women that make up the different Peace Teams in this Project. To both, we extend our gratitude and admiration. A special thank you also goes to the entire Project staff and to Serb, Croat, Roma, Hungarian, and Jewish men and women who shared with us their fears, dreams and aspirations for a better future. We leave the reader with an anecdote that captures both the reasons for hope in Croatia and the challenge of any intervention in the region. In one of the many train rides Jessica took from Zagreb to Osijek she met Miroslav. He was rather talkative and happy to tell her about his upcoming wedding- one he had been planning for over four years. Finally, he had a secure job and was ready to wed his high school sweetheart. After our six-hour ride, which was filled with conversation, laughter, food and plenty of smoke, he turned to her and said, “Jessica <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something?</b> ” “Of course”, she said. “Well, in this job you are going to go do in Osijek….

An expression that expressing intention is the theory of speech act. Illocutionary act is speech act that related {{to the meaning of}} utterance which is conveyed by speaker to the listener. In this research the writer understanding of utterance about illocutionary acts found in “Reunion in Death” novel. The aims of the research is to know what types and functions {{can be found in the}} novel and to know how does the listener translates the speaker’s idea in the dialog of the novel. In other word, the purposes of this research is deal with how to determine the real meaning of the utterances by classify all utterance into categories of illocutionary types and functions. This research uses descriptive qualitative method which used to analyze the data in this research. In this research, the researcher observes and uses a document that is one of techniques in data collection’s types. The researcher identfying and classifying the data through reading the novel. Then, the data are presented descriptively to describes types and function of illocutionary acts and explains data analysis used by using theory of J. R. Searle. In Reunion in Death novel the researcher found there are four types of illocutionary acts such as (1) assertive; she know something, (2) directive; <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> about Stibbs’ case?, (3) commissive; I won’t let you down, (4) expressive; I’m sorry. I never even caught sight of her. This research found four functions of illocutionary acts such as competitive; for instance asking and ordering, convivial; thanking and excusing, conflictive; threatening, and collaborative; reporting, instructing and asserting. Then, the researcher found the real meaning of utterances that is found from the listener reactions to the speaker’s idea or speaker’s means and wants. Last but not least, the researcher suggested; (1) this research will give the benefits to the readers who are interested in this field to obtain deeper understanding in speech act: illocutionary acts analysis in the novel. (2) for teachers, it can be used as additional materials in teaching speech acts in general and illocutionary acts in particular (3) for the researcher herself give the deep knowledge about speech act espacially about illocutionary act. (4) the findings of this study will become useful reference for further researchers in doing the same kind of study. (5) hopefully, for the next researcher who interest to study about illocutionary act in the novel use another theory of illocutionary act so that different results might be found...|$|E

The study involved three semistructured in-depth interviews with each patient (N = 40), which spanned a year. The authors provide a thematic discursive analysis of responses to the question, <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> what made you decide to part in the study and why you've stayed involved over the past year? The main themes are (a) recruitment within health contexts ("the nurse said it would help"), (b) altruism ("if it can help somebody"), (c) qualitative research being seen as inherently innocuous ("nothing to lose"), and (d) therapeutic aspects of interviewing ("getting it off my chest"). The analysis contributes both to the qualitative literature about generic research participation and to a germinal literature exploring qualitative health research participation. © 2006 Sage Publications...|$|R

It is impossible for me to excuse the perversity that holds you responsible for consequences which neither you nor I could imagine or foresee. She is not to be reasoned with--she can only be pitied.
