50|$|Canadian Marconi Company {{stations}} with Canadian VC calls {{did exist}} on Newfoundland in the wireless telegraph era, even though Newfoundland {{was not part}} of the Dominion of Canada.

50|$|A {{submarine}} communications {{cable is}} a cable {{laid on the}} sea bed between <b>land-based</b> <b>stations</b> to carry telecommunication signals across stretches of ocean. The first submarine communications cables, laid in the 1850s, carried telegraphy traffic. Subsequent generations of cables carried telephone traffic, then data communications traffic.

50|$|Pacific {{oyster spat}} {{can be grown}} in {{nurseries}} by sea-based <b>or</b> <b>land-based</b> upwelling systems. Nursery culture reduces mortality in small spat, thus increasing the farm’s efficiency. Sea-based nursery systems are often located in estuarine areas where the spat are mounted on barges <b>or</b> rafts. <b>Land-based</b> nursery systems have spat mounted on barges in large saltwater tanks, which either have a natural algae supply or are enriched with nutrients from fertilizers.|$|R
30|$|We {{analyzed}} approximately 1000 earthquakes between March 2012 and March 2013 {{from the}} Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) catalog (Fig.  1 b, [URL] with magnitudes ranging from 1.1 to 6.3. To select earthquakes, we delineated three regions (indicated by orange, yellow, and blue lines in Fig.  1 b) where we expected the hypocenters {{to be well}} constrained by data from JAMSTEC and ERI OBSs, and <b>land-based</b> <b>stations.</b> Of the earthquakes in the JMA catalog located within these three regions, we selected those with signals that were recorded by at least three JAMSTEC OBS stations. We picked the onset times of P- and S-wave arrivals manually from the vertical and horizontal components of the OBS data. We also recorded the polarity of P-wave first motions when possible. We used the DPG records of one BBOBS to obtain onset times and first motions in cases where velocity seismograms were not available. For the <b>land-based</b> <b>stations,</b> we collected P- and S-wave arrival data and P-wave first motion data from the catalog published by NIED. The total numbers of P- and S-wave arrivals {{used in this study}} were 23, 670 and 12, 872, respectively.|$|R

40|$|Data on the spaceflight {{communications}} equipment status during the Skylab mission {{were subjected to}} an operational reliability assessment. Reliability models were revised to reflect pertinent equipment changes accomplished prior {{to the beginning of}} the Skylab missions. Appropriate adjustments were made to fit the data to the models. The availabilities are based on the failure events resulting in the stations inability to support a function of functions and the MTBF's are based on all events including 'can support' and 'cannot support'.

5000|$|British {{analysts in}} World War I {{noticed that the}} call sign of German Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, {{commanding}} the hostile fleet, had been transferred to a <b>land-based</b> <b>station.</b> Admiral of the Fleet Beatty, ignorant of Scheer's practice of changing callsigns upon leaving harbor, dismissed its importance and disregarded Room 40 analysts' attempts to make the point. The German fleet sortied, and the British were late in meeting them at the Battle of Jutland. If traffic analysis had been taken more seriously, the British might have done better than a 'draw'.|$|R

30|$|Few seismic {{observations}} {{have been}} conducted with ocean-bottom seismometers (OBS) off the Boso Peninsula, particularly south of 35.5 °N. The Earthquake Research Institute (ERI) of the University of Tokyo conducted aftershock observations following the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake across a broad area of the Japan Trench forearc region (Shinohara et al. 2011, 2012 a), {{but they did not}} cover the majority of the region off the Boso Peninsula (south of 35.5 °N). In this study, we determine hypocenter distributions and focal mechanisms of earthquakes off the Boso Peninsula, as close to the Japan Trench and Sagami Trough as possible, by using data from both OBSs and <b>land-based</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R
40|$|The world's first radio {{company was}} {{registered}} in Britain in 1897. Many people then expected that conventional line telegraphs, with their costly paraphernalia of wires, posls and submarine cables, {{would soon be}} obsolete.
