He recalls that when he attended the table-read for the episode, the staff thought it was [...] "hilarious" [...] and they <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "going to be a good one." [...] It was the last episode to be produced during the season nine production run and because it takes several months to complete the production of a single episode, it had to air as a hold-over in the upcoming tenth season. It was decided that [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] would be the premiere episode of season ten. As a result, the annual premiere party was held at the Museum of Science and Technology in Los Angeles – it was a tradition for the premiere party {{to be related to the}} premiere episode.|$|E

During April, the Thames was dredged and six more bodies were discovered, including Doris Marmon and Harry Simmons—Dyer's last victims.

At first, they look like they're going to perform for the boys, like the Spice Girls in [...] "Say You'll Be There" [...] or maybe taunt them a bit, like Janet Jackson and her crew in [...] "You Want This". But there's another story here, {{having to do with}} the juxtapositions of the post-apocalyptic environment, the athletic survivor-girls wielding their martial-arts sticks, and the song's lyrics. The lyrics concern Mýa's query to her man, wondering why another girl is calling his phone [...] "after midnight". This caller, narrates Mýa, is [...] "Saying come over / Cause she's all alone / I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> your ex / By your tone." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 5, 1985, twin {{brothers}} Bill and Bob Clark sighted a 60+ {{foot long}} sea serpent in San Francisco Bay that crashed onto a submerged rocky ledge only 20 {{yards away from}} where {{they were sitting in}} their car. It was around 7:45 a.m. and the water was calm. The Clark brothers were sitting in their car drinking coffee when they noticed a group of seals in the water. Then they noticed what they thought was another seal approach the group. The group of seals began to swim away and one of them headed for the seawall where the Clarks were parked. The seals were followed by the creature and according to Bob, [...] "Bill started saying it was moving strange. He said it was not a seal, it's a snake." [...] Bob continued, [...] "We watched it coming in, undulating in a vertical manner. Where most snakes undulate side to side, this was up and down, creating humps in the water. Bob said, [...] "The seals were leaping through the water in front of it. I think it was going to eat them. It was behind the seals arched above the water line and I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a large animal when the arch appeared to stay in one spot. I could see the body moving through the arch." [...] The Clarks said the water was so clear that morning they could easily see the creature as it undulated at amazing speed like an uncoiling whip. [...] They both estimated the length of the creature to be at least 60 feet. As it swam over the submerged rocky ledge it stopped dead in its tracks then it appeared to slide a few feet across the water creating a light spray. It apparently got stuck on the rocks. Bob said the animal turned clockwise and exposed its midsection. [...] "It turned over like a corkscrew in midsection. We could see the belly of the animal. It reminded me of an alligator stomach, creamy white, soft leathery looking, but with a tint of yellow in it." [...] He continued saying, [...] "After it twisted over and showed the underbelly, another section behind the underbelly came up about three feet out of the water. I got an excellent view of a fin-type appendage, which opened up like an accordion fan. It stayed up about five seconds, long enough for me to tell my brother, 'Bill, I'm going to look at it as long as I can so I can remember it.' [...] " [...] After it twisted the midsection off of the submerged rocky ledge, Bill said they watched the creature sit [...] "motionless in the water for five or ten seconds". Then it began to swim away, using a [...] "violent, downward thrust of its upper neck which sent a pack of coils backwards towards the midsection. After a few seconds of undulations, the creature moved rapidly, just {{below the surface of the}} water northward toward deeper water in the middle of the Bay." [...] Bill concluded his account by saying, [...] "I don't care if anyone believes me. I know what I saw. It was too mind-blowing and close to me not to say something about it." ...|$|E

60|$|This was {{all that}} the Indian <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> enough, and Joseph Morris ran back to inform Captain Tanner and the others. Those who were {{sleeping}} were aroused, and each man and boy was assigned to his place of duty.|$|R

60|$|A {{dim light}} {{streamed}} {{down from the}} hole. Two of his comrades lifted Francis so that his head was above {{the level of the}} hole, and he was enabled to see into the cabin. So far as he <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> untenanted, but it was possible that the commander might be on the divan above him. This was not, however, likely, as in the gale that was now blowing he would probably be on deck, directing the working of the ship.|$|E

"Well, {{you must}} know," [...] he began, after {{finishing}} his supper and lighting his pipe, [...] "that long-legged frigate o' mine that Dan calls a chestnut-- though a cocoanut {{would be more}} like the thing, if you take size into account--he's as keen for the chase as a small boy arter a butterfly, an' before I could say `Jack Robinson,' a'most, he had me into the middle o' the herd an' alongside o' the big bull.

60|$|There was {{a council}} of war held to {{consider}} what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> best to do. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> a council of perplexity and despair.

60|$|Yes, {{the fatal}} {{intelligence}} proved true. The drum {{was no longer}} heard rolling the men to the tub, and deep gloom and dejection fell like a cloud. The ship was like a great city, when some terrible calamity has overtaken it. The men stood apart, in groups, discussing their woes, and mutually condoling. No longer, of still moonlight nights, was the song heard from the giddy tops; and {{few and far between}} were the stories that were told. It was during this interval, so dismal to many, that to the amazement of all hands, ten men were reported by the master-at-arms to be intoxicated. They were brought up to the mast, and at their appearance the doubts of the most skeptical were dissipated; but whence they had obtained their liquor no one <b>could</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> observed, however at the time, that the tarry knaves all smelled of lavender, like so many dandies.|$|E
6000|$|... "But now {{see what}} a good bruddykins I am. I have seen a fight, a real {{exciting}} fight, and I have kept it to the last to tell you about.... It was a fight in the air. And the British won. It began with a German machine appearing, very minute and high, sailing towards our lines {{a long way to}} the left. We <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a German because of the black cross; they decorate every aeroplane with a black Iron Cross on its wings and tail; that our officer could see with his glasses. (He let me look.) Suddenly whack, whack, whack, came a line of little puffs of smoke behind it, and then one in front of it, which meant that our anti-aircraft guns were having a go at it. Then, as suddenly, Archibald stopped, and we could see the British machine buzzing across the path of the German. It was just like two birds circling in the air. Or wasps. They buzzed like wasps. There was a little crackling--like brushing your hair in frosty weather. They were shooting at each other. Then our lieutenant called out, 'Hit, by Jove!' and handed the glasses to Park and instantly wanted them back. He says he saw bits of the machine flying off.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Suppose I tell him,' she thought; 'wouldn't {{it really}} be safer?' This hideous luck {{had no right}} to spoil their love; he must see that! They could not let it! People always {{accepted}} an accomplished fact in time! From that piece of philosophy--profound enough at her age--she passed to another consideration less philosophic. If she persuaded Jon to a quick and secret marriage, and he found out afterward that she had known the truth. What then? Jon hated subterfuge. Again, then, would it not be better to tell him? But the memory of his mother's face kept intruding on that impulse. Fleur was afraid. His mother had power over him; more power perhaps than she herself. Who <b>could</b> <b>tell?</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> too great a risk. Deep-sunk in these instinctive calculations she was carried on past Green Street as far as the Ritz Hotel. She got down there, and walked back on the Green Park side. The storm had washed every tree; they still dripped. Heavy drops fell on to her frills, and to avoid them she crossed over under the eyes of the Iseeum Club. Chancing to look up she saw Monsieur Profond with a tall stout man in the bay window. Turning into Green Street she heard her name called, and saw [...] "that prowler" [...] coming up. He took off his hat--a glossy [...] "bowler" [...] such as she particularly detested.|$|E

However, observers had noticed her struggle with the apparatus over {{the months leading up}} to the competition including her former coach Béla Károlyi, past and present teammates, and even her present coach Al Fong. Gomez's technique on the extremely difficult Yurchenko vault had been described as shaky at best, and Gomez was unable to perform the vault with any consistency during practices, sometimes missing her feet on the springboard. [...] A teammate from Károlyi's, Chelle Stack, later stated, [...] "You <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a safe vault for her to be doing.
