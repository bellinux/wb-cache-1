40|$|The {{effect of}} UV/Cl- 2 {{disinfection}} on the biofilm and corrosion {{of cast iron}} pipes in drinking water distribution system were studied using annular reactors (ARs). Passivation occurred more rapidly in the AR with UV/Cl- 2 than in the one with Cl- 2 alone, decreasing iron release for higher <b>corrosivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> Based on functional gene, pyrosequencing assays and principal component analysis, UV disinfection not only reduced the required initial chlorine dose, but also enhanced denitrifying functional bacteria advantage in the biofilm of corrosion scales. The nitrate-reducing bacteria (NRB) Dechloromonas exhibited the greatest corrosion inhibition by inducing the redox cycling of iron to enhance the precipitation of iron oxides and formation of Fe 3 O 4 in the AR with UV/Cl- 2, while the rhizobia Bradyrhizobium and Rhizobium, and the NRB Sphingomonas, Brucella producing siderophores had weaker corrosion-inhibition effect by capturing iron in the AR with Cl- 2.

Corrosion of steel infrastructure in the Duluth-Superior Harbor (DSH) {{is a concern}} for those who own and maintain structures that are critical for maritime transportation. Long-term corrosion rates of steel structures in the DSH were 2 to 4 times faster than is typical for other freshwater habitats, ranging from 0. 06 to 0. 14 mm/yr. The highest rates of steel corrosion were found at moderately to severely corroded sites and were within the lower range for corrosion of steel in seawater. It {{is important to know}} the potential roles that water quality and microorganisms play in the corrosion process to better understand why steel structures in the DSH are corroding faster than expected and to develop methods to prevent or mitigate this problem. Dissolved oxygen increased and chloride and sulfate concentrations decreased in the late 20 th century in the DSH after the Western Lake Superior Sanitary District became operational. In 2010, only alkalinity, chloride, and conductivity were positively related to long-term steel corrosion rates in the DSH and interestingly, dissolved oxygen was inversely related to it. The Larson-Skold Index, which measures the <b>corrosivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> towards steel, decreased or remained constant at three sites between 1972 and 1996. The Larson-Skold Index was usually below the threshold for concern in 2010 - 2011, indicating that changes in water chemistry alone may not be responsible for the severe corrosion of steel in this harbor. Gallionella, a genus of iron-oxidizing bacteria, was more abundant within corrosion tubercles on severely corroded steel structures in the DSH where more than 109 Gallionella 16 S rRNA copies/dry g of tubercle were observed, representing 2 % to 34 % of the total prokaryotic cells recovered from these tubercles. Gallionella bacteria were less abundant (~ 107 copies/dry g) on steel structures at sites along the north shore of Lake Superior. DNA from Gallionella was not detected in the water surrounding corroding steel structures in the DSH or in harbors on the north shore of Lake Superior, indicating that these bacteria were enriched on corroding steel. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were also more abundant within tubercles at severely corroded sites but at least 2 orders of magnitude less abundant than Gallionella bacteria, accounting for less than 1 % of prokaryotic cells within these corrosion tubercles. Considered alone, neither the abundance of Gallionella or SRB was related to long-term steel corrosion rates in the DSH. A multiple linear regression model was developed using water quality parameters and bacterial abundances to predict steel corrosion rates. The model used alkalinity, sulfate concentration, and log 10 transformed SRB abundance to predict the long-term steel corrosion rate. It overestimated the long-term corrosion rate of a steel structure in one harbor along the north shore of Lake Superior and slightly underestimated the corrosion rate at a second harbor. It is clear that the corrosion of steel structures is accelerated in the DSH compared to other freshwater environments and water chemistry is not likely the sole cause of this corrosion. Rather, a combination of chemical and microbiological factors appears to influence the corrosion of steel structures in this harbor...|$|E

Well-known methods can minimize the presence of asbestos fibers in finished drinking water.

40|$|Pelagic {{sedimentation}} is {{the primary}} modifier of topography generated by ridge-associated volcanic and tectonic processes. This thesis represents an effort to understand the processes of, and the general distribution of, pelagic sedimentation on rough topography, particularly in the Atlantic Basin but with applications to the world ocean as a whole. This study utilizes a simple numerical model of sedimentation which, when applied to models of rough basement topography, allows us to study sedimentation effects in terms of commonly-measured stochastic parameters including seafloor RMS height, abyssal hill spacing, and slope distribution. We also address the effect of sediment compaction on seafloor morphology, {{and the impact of}} long-wavelength topography on stochastic measures of sedimented seafloor. Understanding gained allows the construction of inverse problems to obtain information about sediment distribution and basement morphology from multibeam bathymetric data in regimes where backscatter from rough, reflective basement highs obscures returns from wide-beam seismic systems. By using maximum likelihood estimation to compare slope distribution functions calculated from data to those from filtered model topographies, we estimate average sediment thickness L, basement RMS height H, and a measure of sediment mobility k. Using data from near-ridge surveys and off-axis transit lines, we invert for L, H, and K for 3 - 29 Ma seafloor from the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) near 26 * N, 2 - 45 Ma seafloor from the western flank of the MAR near 260 S, 2 - 40 Ma seafloor from the eastern flank of the MAR near 25 * S, and 1 - 38 Ma seafloor from the western flank of the MAR near 35 * S. Variations in L with seafloor age allow us to constrain sediment rain rate and the <b>corrosivity</b> <b>of</b> bottom <b>waters</b> to calcite since the Oligocene. We hypothesize that sediment rain rates during much of the early and middle Miocene were only 10 - 50 % of the average rate for the past - 10 m. y.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 212 - 223. The {{performance}} of developmental alloyed steels with improved abrasive-corrosive wear resistant properties has been evaluated. The synergistic effect of abrasion and corrosion in the accelerated wear of steels is examined {{and the main}} parameters identified. A model of the process is proposed. The model is used to develop the optimum abrasive-corrosive wear resistance in steels for applications in the gold mines of South Africa. A wide range of engineering steels, both commercially available and experimental, has been evaluated in laboratory simulated abrasive and abrasive-corrosive wear tests. An appraisal of the wear tests and {{the applicability of the}} results to in-service conditions has {{led to the development of}} an additional abrasive-corrosive wear test. It has been established that both the microstructure and chemical composition determine the resistance of a material to wear. Control of the microstructure by alloying and heat treatment is attempted in order to optimise the abrasive-corrosive wear resistant properties for each class of microstructure whilst maintaining adequate formability and weldability. Abrasion of a metal surface has been shown to accelerate the rate of corrosion. Three categories of corrosion behavior are defined. A model of the abrasive-corrosive wear process is proposed to account for the behavior. The model adequately predicts the outcome to a change in system parameter, namely: an increase in the <b>corrosivity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>water,</b> an increase in the frequency of abrasive events, a change in the chemical composition and the degree of passivity inherent in the material. Recommendations are made to maximize the abrasive-corrosive wear resistant properties without resorting to expensive highly alloyed steels. To satisfy the needs of the mining industry, two microstructures of note are identified: a metastable austenitic (TRIP type) steel and a 0. 25 % carbon lath martensitic alloyed steel. A basic chemical composition is proposed with each microstructure. The austenitic steel is shown to achieve its abrasion resistance through the high degree of work hardening it undergoes during abrasion and the high ultimate strength of the strained material. The lath martensitic steel has the necessary strength to toughness ratio for good abrasion resistance. A 20 % degree of work hardening in conjunction with a bulk hardness in excess of 500 HV is prescribed for superior abrasion resistant properties in the wear system of the mines. The life time cost of the martensitic alloyed steel recommends it for applications in the gold mines of South Africa...|$|R
