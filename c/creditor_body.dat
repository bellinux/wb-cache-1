50|$|Probably {{the most}} illustrious {{member of the}} Croÿ-Roeulx branch was Eustache's nephew, Charles Eugène de Croÿ (1651-1702). He participated in the Battle of Lund (1676) against the Swedes before {{succeeding}} to his father's title as Prince of Croÿ-Millendonck in 1681. Charles Eugene fought with success in the Imperial Austrian Army against the Turks and participated in both the liberation of Vienna in 1683 and the attack on Belgrade in 1690. He was promoted Imperial field marshal for his vital services to the Austrian crown. In 1697 he entered the Russian service and {{was put in charge}} of Peter I's forces fighting in Livonia during the initial stages of the Great Northern War. After suffering a humiliating defeat in the Battle of Narva on 20 November 1700, Charles Eugene was taken prisoner by the Swedes and died at their fortress of Reval on January 30, 1702. On demand of his <b>creditors,</b> his <b>body</b> was not buried {{for more than a century}} (190 years-until 1897), and, when mummified, was exhibited in a glass coffin as a curiosity, with fees paid by tourists as a price of admission used to settle his debts.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} four discrete {{periods of}} sovereign default and restructuring {{over the past}} 135 years and seeks to explain the observed variation in aggregated bargaining outcomes between debtor states and private creditors. Utilizing a power-based analytical framework borrowed from Barnett and Duvall (2005), the study assesses the relative impact of four principal regime components on distributional results: the private <b>creditor</b> representative <b>body</b> (institutional power); the degree and orientation of creditor country government/IFI intervention (compulsory power); the structure and condition of the capital markets (structural power); and, the discursive practices surrounding sovereign default (productive power). The analysis suggests that the key private creditor institutions - the British Corporation of Foreign Bondholders, the American Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, and The London Club - have only marginally influenced results, and that outcomes were instead driven by the action (or inaction) of creditor governments, the structure of capital access (centralized or decentralized), and the relative condition of the private capital markets (robust or collapsed). The paper concludes that compulsory and structural regime elements are therefore more salient than institutional ones in the sovereign debt bargaining exercise. From a public policy perspective, this study cautions those who seek a newly-constituted, 21 st-century bondholder council, since such an institution - like its historical predecessors - would find {{its impact on the}} sovereign debt management process highly circumscribed. The thesis also challenges economic theory on the matter of sovereign repayment incentives, arguing that the "either-or" nature of the reputation-sanctions debate (Eaton-Gersovitz (1981) vs. Bulow-Rogoff (1989)) distracts from the fact that these incentives have operated simultaneously over the past 135 years. More specifically, the evidence suggests that structural and compulsory regime elements - the equivalent of reputation and sanctions in the formal models - have largely reinforced one another in the sovereign debt restructuring process, thereby amplifying their impact on negotiating outcomes in each historical period...|$|R
