40|$|AbstractBearings are key {{components}} of <b>cone</b> <b>bit,</b> thus its rapid failure is {{a major cause of}} leading to lower life of the bit. To improve the bearing performance and prolong working life, contact mechanics of hollow cylindrical roller bearing of <b>cone</b> <b>bit</b> was simulated. Effects of hollow size, drilling pressure, friction coefficient and fitting clearance on mechanics performance of the bearing were studied. The results show that the maximum equivalent stress of the hollow cylindrical roller bearing appears on the claw journal, and the maximum contact stress appears on the contact pair of the hollow roller. Besides, hollow sizes have a greater impact on the equivalent stress and contact stress of the cylindrical roller, while the influence on the stress of the cone and claw journal is relatively small. With the increasing of the drilling pressure and fitting clearance, equivalent stress and contact stress of bearing parts increase. The friction coefficient has little impact on mechanical performance of the bearing. As the 121 / 4 SWPI 517 type hollow cylindrical roller bearing of <b>cone</b> <b>bit</b> an example, the optimal hollow size is 55 %, the drilling pressure is 140  kN and the fitting clearance is 0 – 0. 02  mm...|$|E

The results of an investigation into the process of impact load harmonics formation and superposition, as well as into the interrelation of drilling process parameters in different loading conditions, with due regard for an adaptive element smoothing the impact load harmonics when passing through rock of different drillability indices, have been adduced.

40|$|Well {{drilling}} is {{an important}} process for extracting oil, natural gas, water, and mineral materials. Opening wells requires boring through earth formations, which can range from very soft to very hard. Penetrating into such formations requires specialized tools and operation procedures which should be employed based {{on the environment and}} application. Rotary drilling, in which a drill bit is used to crush the rock and penetrate into the formation, {{is one of the main}} methods of well drilling. Rotary <b>cone</b> <b>bits</b> are one of the main types of drill bits used for rotary drilling. There are two main problems encountered when drilling with rotary <b>cone</b> <b>bits.</b> Excessive vibration can cause damage to the entire system and can decrease efficiency of the drilling process. Failure of the bit’s bearings and seals can also result in damage to the bit and cessation of the drilling process. In recent years, a great deal of research has been undertaken to address these problems and find appropriate solutions to improve drilling efficiency and production rate while reducing the overall cost of drilling. In this thesis, a new design for rotary <b>cone</b> <b>bits,</b> with the objective of improving overall drilling performance, is presented. First, a new pattern for distribution of inserts over the cone is presented, which results in reduced vibration of the drillstring. Second a new design for the bit’s bearings is introduced that is capable of operating in harsh environments.

40|$|Rotary {{drilling}} with roller <b>cone</b> <b>bit</b> {{is often}} accompanied by wide fluctuations of the weight on bit (WOB). In certain cases the WOB periodically reduces to null.

The present study models the interaction among the lift-off of the bit, the WOB variation, and the modulation of the amplitude of the lobes on the formation surface. The analytical model is used to obtain numerical results for a specific drillstring. From these results it is inferred that the rotary speeds corresponding to the axial resonant frequencies of the system, determined from {{the functions of the}} driving point mobility and impedance at the bit, are critical regarding the wide fluctuations of the WOB.

30|$|An {{experimental}} study of rock-breaking with an offset single <b>cone</b> <b>bit</b> was completed on the bit bench test equipment. Data such as transmission ratio, weight on bit (WOB), rate of penetration (ROP) and torque on bit were acquired in the experiments. Based on analyzing the experimental results, several conclusions were drawn as follows. The transmission ratio of the offset single-cone bit changed slightly with rotary speed of bit, weight on bit and offset distance. The rate of penetration of the offset single-cone bit increased with increase of WOB and offset distance. The torque on bit increased with increase of offset distance under the same WOB and bit rotary speed, decreased with increase of bit rotary speed under the same WOB. The rock-breaking mechanism of the offset single-cone bit was a scraping action. This indicates that the offset single-cone bit is a chipping type bit.|$|E

Three cemented carbide WC–Co inserts were selected with different cobalt content and WC grain size distribution.

The experimental measurements were performed using load, torque, displacement sensors, an acoustic emission sensor and four thermocouples. These measurements showed that the friction coefficient and the mean contact temperature decrease with the cemented carbide's cobalt content. The acoustic emission energy displayed a clear dependence with the mean WC grain size and the WC–Co fracture toughness. It was {{also found that the}} insert's wear is proportional to the load but not to the time (or distance). Eventually, a third body approach clearly showed that the inserts and the counterfaces contribute to form an interfacial abrasive paste.

50|$|Several factors affect {{drill bit}} selection. Due {{to the high}} number of wells that have been drilled, {{information}} from an adjacent well is most often used to make the appropriate selection. Two different types of drill bits exist: fixed cutter and roller cone. A fixed cutter bit is one where there are no moving parts, but drilling occurs due to shearing, scraping or abrasion of the rock. Fixed cutter bits can be either polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) or grit hotpressed inserts (GHI) or natural diamond. Roller <b>cone</b> <b>bits</b> can be either tungsten carbide inserts (TCI) for harder formations or milled tooth (MT) for softer rock. The manufacturing process and composites used in each type of drill bit make them ideal for specific drilling situations.

There is a significant positive correlation between contact pressure and external load, radius clearance value, and the Young's modulus of material. However, there is an evident negative correlation between contact radius of journal bearing and radius clearance value, and the Young's modulus of material. The smaller radius clearance value of journal bearing is, the more centralized contact region will be, so the corresponding contact pressure will be higher. From the perspective of reducing friction and wear, we need select the materials which have high strength and good toughness. Not only might this can improve the wear resistance, it also effectively decreases the contact pressure.

30|$|Elevated {{temperatures}} {{have also}} been encountered in three geothermal systems in the United States (e.g., Elders 2015). Several high-temperature wells have been drilled at The Geysers geothermal field and its environs. The Wilson No. 1 well was drilled in 1981 outside of the main field on the flanks of Mount Hannah {{to a depth of}} 3672  m (Fournier 1991; DOGGR online well records 1982). While the maximum measured (unequilibrated) temperature for this well is 325  °C, fluid inclusions recovered in cuttings suggest bottom-hole temperatures of up to 400  °C. A high-pressure zone was encountered {{near the bottom of the}} well, and a steam entry was observed at total depth. Casing collapse led to abandonment of the well. The highest temperatures that have been encountered to date at The Geysers were measured in a well that was deepened in 2010 as part of a US DOE-funded EGS field demonstration project in the NW Geysers high-temperature reservoir. A steam entry was encountered in the deepened Prati- 32 well at 3352  m with a measured temperature of 400  °C. Drilling difficulties caused by elevated temperatures (the well was drilled with air) led to low rates of penetration (ROP, 3  m/h) and extreme bit wear (the last roller <b>cone</b> <b>bit</b> only lasted 30  m); thus the well was completed at a depth of 3396  m. This well was used as the injection well for the EGS production-injection well pair for this project (Garcia et al. 2016).|$|E
40|$|A new, highly adaptable, {{framework}} for the simulation of bit dynamics is introduced. The new software, dubbed Three Dimensional Bit Dynamics (TDBD), is implemented as object- orientated code and designed to meet current and future research needs. The software uses a triangulated mesh to represent the bit and rock surface geometry. A novel method for updating the rock surface as the bit drills is presented. This method uses information from both the bit and rock surface to allow for general motion of the bit (including whirl). It also limits the number of operations required to maintain the shape quality of the elements in the rock surface mesh. This method avoids the costly operation of removing elements and remeshing the resulting hole. A derivation of the equations of motion of a roller <b>cone</b> <b>bit</b> is presented {{as an example of}} coupled rotating rigid bodies. The equations are derived using the virtual power method which naturally handles the constraint between the bit body and the cones. A state-of-the-art numerical integrator is applied to the equations to produce an algorithm suitable for use in a bit dynamics software application. The integrator is a composition of adjoint first order integrators (reminiscent of the approach used earlier in Reference [47] to derive an explicit midpoint Lie method). It maintains the properties of the original three degree-of-freedom integrator: second order convergence, symplecticness, remarkable accuracy, and momentum conservation. This algorithm can be applied to other applications where rotating rigid bodies are coupled through an axis that allows rotation. The force model from Reference [33], used for calculating the forces on a bit resulting from rock removal, is implemented within the framework and used to evaluate the software. The weight-on-bit and torque-on-bit are compared to laboratory data. Two polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits are used to calibrate the force model and a third is run in the software to "predict" the laboratory dat...|$|E

40|$|Drilling {{with water}} has the {{potential}} to significantly reduce the respirable dust concentrations generated from small-diameter rotary drills when drilling blastholes on surface mining operations. However, water adverseky affects tri- <b>cone</b> drill <b>bits</b> commonly used in surface drilling operations, causing excessive wear and premature replacement. Consequently, dry drilling with a dust collector system has the most widespread use in the industry. Tests have been conducted by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NOSH), Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) on a newly designed device for smaller diameter drills that separates the water from the bailing air before it reaches the bit and thus provides the cost benefit of dry drilling while providing the benefit of wet drilling for dust suppression. The water that is delivered to the hole with the bailing air is separated from the air by a proprietary mechanical device that is encased in a drill sub (short section of drill rod/pipe) located immediately behind the cutting bit. A cascade cyclone and a real-time dust monitor were used to sample dust emissions from the holes. Dust concentrations and silica content were measured when drilling dry versus drilling wet.
