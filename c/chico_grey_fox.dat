40|$|We {{studied the}} annual and {{seasonal}} food habits of sympatric <b>grey</b> <b>fox</b> (Lycalopex griseus) and culpeo fox (Lycalopex culpaeus) in a protected area, in southeastern Argentine Patagonia, {{to test the}} hypothesis that both <b>foxes</b> partition prey. <b>Grey</b> <b>foxes</b> consumed a larger proportion of rodents than culpeos (66. 1 % versus 37. % of occurrences in feces, respectively), and culpeos consumed a larger proportion of the introduced European hare (Lepus europaeus) (32. 8 % versus 7. 1 %, respectively). Additionally, arthropods made up {{a significant portion of the}} diet of the <b>grey</b> <b>fox,</b> and occurred in the 95. 5 % of the analyzed feces. Despite the great differences in size of culpeo and <b>grey</b> <b>foxes,</b> the former being significantly larger, both species consumed the same type of prey, and no significant differences in the mean weight of vertebrate prey were detected in their diets. Culpeo and <b>grey</b> <b>foxes</b> diets differed during spring – summer with low values of mean diet overlap (31 %). But in autumn – winter, when prey diversity is lower in Patagonia, diet was more similar and diet overlap (73 %) increased. An exploratory analysis of habitat use by culpeo and <b>grey</b> <b>foxes</b> suggested that both species utilize habitat in a similar way. Our data agree with generalizations about competitive interactions between the large and the small canid in an assemblage. Although both foxes can potentially consume the same type of prey, through interference the larger culpeo would exclude the smaller <b>grey</b> <b>fox</b> from habitats with high-quality prey, resulting in prey partitioning. The possibility that both foxes partition habitat at a finer scale in our study area should be explored. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Archival {{specimens}} of gastric mucosa of 10 raccoons (Procyon lotor), 9 porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum), 6 <b>grey</b> <b>foxes</b> (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), 6 bobcats (Lynx rufus), 4 skunks (Mephitis mephitis), and 3 black bears (Ursus americanus) were microscopically examined {{for evidence of}} Helicobacter-like organisms. Such organisms were seen in the specimens from the <b>grey</b> <b>foxes</b> and bobcats only. Histochemical stains (modified Steiner and carbol fuchsin methods) revealed long spiral organisms within lumina of gastric glands; however, neither gross nor microscopic lesions were observed. By electron microscopy (EM), the organisms {{were found to be}} free in the glandular lumina and were seen occasionally in the cytoplasm of gastric epithelial cells. Morphologically, 2 different phenotypes of spiral organisms were identified by EM. The organisms associated with bobcats appeared to be more tightly coiled than those seen in <b>grey</b> <b>foxes.</b> The presence of Helicobacter-like organisms in the gastric mucosa of <b>grey</b> <b>foxes</b> has not previously been described...|$|R
