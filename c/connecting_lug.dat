5000|$|The wire may {{be wrapped}} {{directly}} under {{the head of a}} screw, may be held by a metal plate forced against the wire by a screw, or may be held by what is, in effect, a set screw in the side of a metal tube. The wire may be directly stripped of insulation and inserted under the head of a screw or into the terminal. Otherwise, it may be either inserted first into a ferrule, which is then inserted into the terminal, or else attached to a <b>connecting</b> <b>lug.</b> which is then fixed under the screw head.|$|E
2500|$|Catapult setup: [...] The starter trolley {{with the}} {{hydrogen}} peroxide (...) and catalyst (potassium permanganate granules, Z-stoff) {{was connected to}} provide steam to the ramp's firing tube, and the steam piston was placed into the firing tube with the piston's launching <b>lug</b> <b>connected</b> to the V-1.|$|R
50|$|Cvetanova Ćuprija (Serbian Cyrillic: Цветанова ћуприја) is a 3 {{kilometers}} long street which <b>connects</b> Veliki Mokri <b>Lug</b> and Medaković III and a sub-neighborhood of Veliki Mokri Lug developing around it. It {{goes through}} the entire western section of the neighborhood, but the term is mostly applied to the previously empty are along the street between Veliki Mokri Lug and Belgrade, which {{is becoming more and}} more urbaznied since the early 2000s.|$|R
25|$|Lugged steel {{construction}} uses standard cylindrical steel tubes which are <b>connected</b> with <b>lugs,</b> external fittings made {{of pieces of}} steel (sometimes stainless steel) which fit over {{the ends of the}} tubing. Before assembly, the builder cuts the tubes to the desired length and precisely mitres their ends, providing a tight fit. The end of the tubes are inserted into the lugs and subsequently brazed with a silver or brass filler metal. The lug greatly increases the strength of the joint by distributing the molten filler metal over a larger surface area via capillary action. When brazing a bicycle frame, builders may use a small positioning structure called a jig to hold the tubes in place and maintain their precise alignment and frame geometry.|$|R

5000|$|Wear bars (or wear indicators) {{are raised}} {{features}} {{located at the}} bottom of the tread grooves that indicate the tire has reached its wear limit. When the tread lugs are worn to the point that the wear bars <b>connect</b> across the <b>lugs,</b> the tires are fully worn and should be taken out of service. Most wear bars indicate a remaining tread depth of 1.6 mm and are tires are deemed [...] "worn out" [...] when the tread is worn down to that point.|$|R
50|$|The M7 {{blade and}} hilt {{are very similar}} to the M4 bayonet with the Korean War era plastic grips for the M1/M2 {{carbines}} except that the M7 has a much larger muzzle ring. The M7 has the same two-lever locking mechanism as the M4, that <b>connects</b> to a <b>lug</b> on the M16 barrel. The blade and basic grip for the M7 is similar to the M6 (M14 rifle), M5 (M1 rifle), and M4 (M1/M2 carbine), all derived from the World War II M3 fighting knife.|$|R
50|$|The second tunnel {{is being}} built {{parallel}} to the existing tunnel tunnel, which can accommodate two tracks and allow speeds of up to 70 km / h. The new tunnel will have a length of 1822 m and be covered by up to 180 m of rock. The internal dimensions of 8.5 m height and 10.5 m width allow double tracks, and thus more than the mere replacement of the existing old tube. The two tubes are to be <b>connected</b> by three <b>lugs,</b> the old tunnel then {{being used as a}} rescue route.|$|R
50|$|A classic type of {{construction}} for both road bicycles and mountain bicycles uses standard cylindrical steel tubes which are <b>connected</b> with <b>lugs.</b> Lugs are fittings made of thicker pieces of steel. The tubes are fitted into the lugs, which encircle {{the end of the}} tube, and are then brazed to the lug. Historically, the lower temperatures associated with brazing (silver brazing in particular) had less of a negative impact on the tubing strength than high temperature welding, allowing relatively light tube to be used without loss of strength. Recent advances in metallurgy ("Air-hardening steel") have created tubing that is not adversely affected, or whose properties are even improved by high temperature welding temperatures, which has allowed both TIG & MIG welding to sideline lugged construction in all but a few high end bicycles. More expensive lugged frame bicycles have lugs which are filed by hand into fancy shapes - both for weight savings and as a sign of craftsmanship. Unlike MIG or TIG welded frames, a lugged frame can be more easily repaired in the field due to its simple construction. Also, since steel tubing can rust (although in practice paint and anti-corrosion sprays can effectively prevent rust), the lugged frame allows a fast tube replacement with virtually no physical damage to the neighbouring tubes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- An inbuilt {{hydraulic}} jack system {{is attached to}} automobile vehicle on front and rear par of the chassis. An automobile {{hydraulic jack}} system can be easily attached to all currently manufacture automobile chassis and frames. There is a front suspension hydraulic jack that is mounted centrally to the front suspension of an automobile between its front wheels. There is also a rear suspension hydraulic jack that is mounted centrally to the rear suspension of the automobile between its rear wheels. The system operates from a compressed fluid reservoir tank that has connections for {{the front and rear}} car jack outlets. Additional outlets can be added to the compressed fluid reservoir tank for <b>connecting</b> a hydraulic <b>lug</b> wrench and another for a tire inflating hose. The Major Project entitled “Inbuilt hydraulic jack in automobile vehicle ” Worked on the principal of hydraulic power and operated by 12 Volt DC current, solves the all major problem of maintenance of all automobiles specially the heavy vehicles like truck and bus. This work, if implemented, would definitely help in the maintenance of automobiles and also in saving of time. I...|$|R
