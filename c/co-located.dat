40|$|Technological {{solutions}} {{to increase the}} efficiency of spatial use can play a key role as part of the toolbox of marine spatial planning. <b>Co-locating</b> of multiple ocean uses can potentially increase the production and enjoyment of the ocean while limiting impacts. However, a basic precondition for <b>co-locating</b> or coproduction is that all parties' private incentives are aligned. We use a case study of <b>co-locating</b> an offshore wind energy firm and a mussel aquaculture firm to assess the incentive structure for cooperation and to demonstrate that social benefits from <b>co-locating</b> exist. We find that there is room for cooperation between firms based on potential cost sharing and that the demonstrated social benefits may arise without government intervention...|$|R

Large areas for automobile parking, often in <b>co-located</b> multi-storey car parks, are also typical to find at airports. Some airports provide shuttle services to parking garages for passengers and airport employees. Due to the very large scale of international airports, some have constructed shuttle services to transport passengers between terminals. Such systems operate for example, in Singapore Changi Airport and Zurich Airport.|$|E

40|$|Foreign investors access local {{knowledge}} by <b>co-locating</b> with other {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) firms. However, different aspects of {{local knowledge}} {{can be obtained from}} different local businesses. Thus some foreign investors <b>co-locate</b> with FDI firms from the same country of origin, while others <b>co-locate</b> with foreign industry peers. We argue that, relative to industry FDI agglomeration, country-of-origin agglomeration provides an effective channel for the sharing of sensitive and tacit knowledge about local business environments. Therefore foreign investors in need of such local knowledge are more likely to locate in country-of-origin agglomerations. Empirical evidence based on FDI in Vietnam indicates that foreign investors who perceive local institutions as particularly weak, and those {{with a high degree of}} outsidership in the local environment, are more likely to seek country-of-origin agglomerations than industry FDI agglomerations. ...|$|R

5|$|After the Fall of France, some French {{scientists}} {{escaped to}} Britain with their stock of heavy water. They were temporarily {{installed in the}} Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where they worked on reactor design. The MAUD Committee was uncertain whether this was relevant to the main task of Tube Alloys, that of building an atomic bomb, although there remained a possibility that a reactor {{could be used to}} breed plutonium, which might be used in one. It therefore recommended that they be relocated to the United States, and <b>co-located</b> with the Manhattan Project's reactor effort. Due to American concerns about security (many of the scientists were foreign nationals) and patent claims by the French scientists and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), it was decided to relocate them to Canada instead.|$|E

5|$|In Oslo, {{the company}} had its offices and {{workings}} spread around town. The main depot was at the East Station; the head office was at Fred. Olsens gate 21 from 1919 to 1921, at Kongens gate 29 until 1932, and at Tollbodgaten 24 until 1938. Management wanted to centralise both a new depot and administrative offices at a single location close to the railway station, preferably <b>co-located</b> with a hotel. In 1936 work began on a hotel at Jernbanetorget, but the project was cancelled. The proposed hotel would have had 100 rooms {{across the street from}} Oslo Ø. However, the plans were blocked by Parliament (which was opposed to the state railway operating hotels). Instead, the administration moved into Nylandsveien 10, in a new building built on a lot owned by NSB.|$|E
5|$|McNair had {{established}} Army Ground Forces headquarters at the Army War College campus, where Devers lived, but Stilwell had moved the headquarters into the Pentagon. Eisenhower, {{as the new}} Chief of Staff of the Army, decided that the Army Ground Forces headquarters should be <b>co-located</b> with the Army Air Forces' Tactical Air Command, so it was moved to Fort Monroe, Virginia, not far from Langley Field. Devers opened his headquarters there on 1 October 1946. Further reorganization occurred on 10 March 1948, when Army Ground Forces was renamed Army Field Forces. Control of the armies {{was transferred to the}} Department of the Army, and Army Field Forces was reduced to a coordinating staff agency.|$|E

5|$|Substantial {{structural}} changes {{took place on}} January12: frontal boundaries separated from {{the core of the}} cyclone; convection developed atop the circulation; and it acquired a weak warm-core. All these factors, alongside the system being <b>co-located</b> with an upper-level low, indicated its transition into a subtropical cyclone by 18:00UTC. Upon doing so, the system received the name Alex. Though relatively shallow, owing to the seasonally low level of the tropopause, convection was deemed deep enough for classification. At this time, the subtropical storm was situated 1,150mi (1,850km) west-southwest of the Canary Islands. The trough that previously enabled the sharp southward turn later steered Alex to the east-northeast and later north-northeast. Operationally, Alex was not classified as a subtropical storm until late on January13.|$|E
5|$|The National Weather Center, {{located in}} Norman, houses a unique {{collection}} of university, state, federal, {{and private sector}} organizations that work together to improve the understanding of events related to the Earth's atmosphere. Norman lies within Tornado Alley, a geographic region where tornadic activity is particularly frequent and intense. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area, including Norman, is the most tornado-prone area in the world. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC), {{a branch of the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is located at the NWC. SPC forecasts severe storm and tornado outbreaks nationwide. Additionally, research is conducted at the <b>co-located</b> National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL), which includes field research and operates various experimental weather radars.|$|E
5|$|The base's origins {{began in}} 1947 with {{an order for}} {{construction}} of an airfield by the New England Division of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The chosen site, in northeastern Maine within both Limestone Township and Caswell Plantation, was the closest point in the continental U.S. to Europe, providing high strategic value during the Cold War. The base was originally named Limestone Army Air Field, and was renamed Limestone Air Force Base following {{the establishment of the}} Air Force in 1947. It was named in 1954 for Major Charles J. Loring, Jr., USAF, a Medal of Honor recipient during the Korean War. From 1951 to 1962, it was <b>co-located</b> next to Caribou Air Force Station.|$|E

5|$|The senior {{officers}} of the 1st Airborne Division had estimated {{that there would be}} around 450 casualties during the capture of the bridge, of which 25 per cent would be killed or missing, and the other 75 per cent wounded. It was appreciated that by themselves the three battalions' medical officers and staff would be unable to cope with the expected numbers of casualties, so one section from the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance, consisting of one doctor and 16 other ranks, would be attached to each of the parachute battalions. The remainder of the field ambulance, comprising the headquarters with two surgical teams, would be <b>co-located</b> with the brigade and establish their main dressing station in farm buildings to the south of the bridge.|$|E
5|$|In October 1995, the National Severe Storms Forecast Center {{relocated}} {{its operations}} to Norman, Oklahoma, and was rechristened the Storm Prediction Center. At that time, the guidance center was housed at Max Westheimer Airport (now the University of Oklahoma Westheimer Airport), <b>co-located</b> {{in the same}} building as the National Severe Storms Laboratory and the local National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office (the latter of which, in addition to disseminating forecasts, oversees the issuance of weather warnings and advisories for the western two-thirds of Oklahoma and western portions of North Texas, and issues outline and status updates for SPC-issued severe thunderstorm and tornado watches that include areas served by the Norman office). In 1998, the Center began issuing the National Fire Weather Outlook to provide forecasts for areas potentially susceptible to the development and spread of wildfires based on certain meteorological factors. The Day 3 Convective Outlook (which is similar in format to the Day 2 forecast) was first issued on an experimental basis in 2000, and was made an official product in 2001.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} of the 48th Battalion was the 47th Battalion, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Imlay, with its forward companies also strung out along the railway line. The total frontage of the 47th Battalion was , which meant that the 180–200 men of the forward companies were positioned in widely spaced posts. Between the two forward companies was a section of embankment near a level crossing which was not garrisoned, but was covered from a shallow cutting to the south and a low embankment to the north. The 47th Battalion's support line was also located on the hill some distance to the rear. The 12th Machine Gun Company was deployed with eight of its Vickers machine guns in each battalion area, mainly sited along the railway line. Leane and Imlay had their headquarters <b>co-located</b> on the summit next to the Albert–Amiens road. Of the two remaining battalions of the 12th Brigade, the 45th Battalion was deployed on the slope behind the 106th Brigade of the 35th Division, and the 46th Battalion was held in reserve near the village of Millencourt.|$|E
