5|$|Bradford Colliery was a {{coal mine}} in Bradford, Manchester, England. Although {{part of the}} Manchester <b>Coalfield,</b> the seams of the Bradford <b>Coalfield</b> {{correspond}} more closely {{to those of the}} Oldham <b>Coalfield.</b> The Bradford <b>Coalfield</b> is crossed by a number of fault lines, principally the Bradford Fault, which was reactivated by mining activity in the mid-1960s.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} coal seams are recognised {{within the}} <b>coalfield.</b> They are listed stratigraphically i.e. uppermost/youngest first. Note {{that not all}} seams are continuous across the <b>coalfield</b> and that correlation of some seams from one basin to another is uncertain.|$|E

50|$|Thus, CIL started {{functioning}} in 1975 with 5 subsidiary companies under it. These were Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), Eastern <b>Coalfields</b> Limited (ECL), Central <b>Coalfields</b> Limited (CCL), Western <b>Coalfields</b> Limited (WCL), and Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Limited (CMPDIL). In due course of time, 3 more companies were formed under CIL by carving out {{certain areas of}} CCL and WCL. These were Northern <b>Coalfields</b> Limited (NCL), South-eastern <b>Coalfields</b> Limited (SECL), and Mahanadi <b>Coalfields</b> Limited (MCL).|$|R
5000|$|The Company {{came into}} {{existence}} in 1985, when Government of India, decided to bifurcate a part of coal mines held by Western <b>Coalfields</b> Limited into new company called South Eastern <b>Coalfields</b> Limited, along with Central <b>Coalfields</b> Limited, which was bifurcated into Northern <b>Coalfields</b> Limited, for administrative purpose.|$|R
5|$|Mining {{is also an}} {{important}} economic support of the Kootenay River area. Although originally valuable minerals such as gold and silver were unearthed, today coal is the primary resource extracted from underground. Conventional coal deposits underlie much of the East Kootenay, especially in the Elk River valley which is home to the Elk Valley <b>Coalfield,</b> and the Crowsnest <b>Coalfield</b> in the Purcell Mountains. The East Kootenay is the most important coal-producing area of British Columbia, has since 1898 produced over 500 million tons, and about 25 percent of the world's steel-making coal comes from the region.|$|E
5|$|The South Wales <b>Coalfield</b> {{extends from}} parts of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire in the west, to Blaenau Gwent and Torfaen in the east, and the rather smaller North Wales <b>Coalfield</b> {{underlies}} parts of Flintshire and Denbighshire. Vast quantities of coal were mined in Wales during the Industrial Revolution and the earlier {{part of the}} twentieth century, after which coal stocks dwindled and the remaining pits became uneconomical as foreign coal became available at low prices. The last deep pit in Wales closed in 2008.|$|E

5|$|The Bradford <b>Coalfield</b> is crossed by {{a number}} of fault lines, principally the Bradford Fault.

5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{occur on}} the western and the eastern fringes of the Peak District, and evidence of past workings can be found from Glossop down to The Roaches, and from Stocksbridge to Baslow. The Coal measures on the eastern fringes of the Peak District form the South Yorkshire <b>Coalfield</b> while the Coal measures on the western fringes form the Lancashire <b>Coalfield.</b> Mining started in medieval times and was at its most productive in the 18th and early 19th centuries, in some cases continuing into the early 20th century. The earliest mining took place at and close to outcrops and miners eventually followed the seams deeper underground as the beds dipped beneath hillsides. At Goyt's Moss and Axe Edge, deep seams were worked and steam engines raised the coal and dewatered the mines. Coal from the eastern mines was used in lead smelting, and coal from the western mines for lime burning.|$|E

5|$|In north Somerset, mining in the Somerset <b>coalfield</b> was an {{important}} industry, and {{in an effort to}} reduce the cost of transporting the coal the Somerset Coal Canal was built; part of it was later converted into a railway. Other canals included the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, Westport Canal, Grand Western Canal, Glastonbury Canal and Chard Canal. The Dorset and Somerset Canal was proposed, but very little of it was ever constructed.|$|E

5|$|Wales has {{a complex}} {{geological}} history which has left it a largely mountainous country. The coastal plain is narrow {{in the north}} and west of the country but wider in the south, where the Vale of Glamorgan has some of the best agricultural land. Exploitation of the South Wales <b>Coalfield</b> during the Industrial Revolution resulted in the development of an urban economy in the South Wales Valleys, and the expansion of the port cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea for the export of coal. The smaller North Wales <b>Coalfield</b> was also developed at this time, but elsewhere in the country, the landscape is rural and communities are small, the economy being largely dependent on agriculture and tourism. The climate is influenced by the proximity of the country to the Atlantic Ocean and the prevailing westerly winds; thus it tends to be mild, cloudy, wet and windy.|$|E
