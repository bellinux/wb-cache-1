25|$|There are {{indirect}} {{and rarely}} used means of using copper ions in solution to form copper(II) chloride. Electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride with copper electrodes produces (among other things) a blue-green foam {{that can be}} collected and converted to the hydrate. While this is not usually done due to the emission of toxic chlorine gas, and the prevalence of the more general chloralkali process, the electrolysis will convert the copper metal to copper ions in solution forming the compound. Indeed, any solution of copper ions can be mixed with hydrochloric acid and made into <b>copper</b> <b>chloride</b> by removing any other ions.|$|E

2500|$|Historically {{weed control}} was by hand-pulling of weeds, often during [...] "fallowing" [...] (which means leaving {{the land to}} carry no crop for a season, during which time the weeds can be found and removed). [...] In 1896 {{it was found that}} a copper {{sulphate}} solution would kill broad-leaved weeds without seriously damaging young cereal plants. [...] Other chemical weedkillers were soon discovered and now common chemical weedkiller ingredients include sodium chlorate, <b>copper</b> <b>chloride,</b> sulphuric acid, dinitroorthocresol and dinitrobutylphenol. [...] Hormone-based weedkillers are used to kill weeds more selectively. [...] Although most weeds are vulnerable to {{at least one of these}} substances, eradicating all the weeds from a particular area will usually need several different weedkillers. The use of pesticides has declined, and British farmers now use about a third less pesticides than they did in 1983. The crop needing most pesticides is wheat.|$|E

50|$|Seeding is {{introduced}} during crystallization. The production is operated continuously under well-defined conditions (pH, feeding rate, concentrations, temperature, etc.). Product with good particle size is produced {{and can be}} easily separated from background salt and other impurities in the mother liquor. After simple rinse with water and drying, pure, free-flowing, non-dusty green crystalline solid with typical particle size of 30 ~ 100 micron is obtained. The product from this process is predominantly atacamite and paratacamite, the stable crystal forms of basic <b>copper</b> <b>chloride</b> - and is called alpha basic <b>copper</b> <b>chloride</b> for simplicity. Careful control of process conditions to favor the alpha polymorphs results in a product that remains free flowing over extended storage times, thus avoiding caking as occurs with both copper sulfate and the botallackite crystal form - also called beta basic <b>copper</b> <b>chloride.</b> This process {{has been used to}} manufacture thousands of tons of tribasic <b>copper</b> <b>chloride</b> every year, and has been the predominant route of commercial production since it was introduced by Micronutrients in 1994.|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{investigations}} of gaseous chlorination-selective oxidation process on primary copper sulfide concentrates are described for producing <b>copper</b> <b>chlorides,</b> elemental sulfur and ferric oxide. The <b>copper</b> <b>chlorides</b> {{can then be}} leached, purified and electrolyzed to produce metallic copper and chlorine regenerated for recycle. When a process, originally proposed on a pyrite concentrate analyzing 2. 5 %Cu using a two-stage reactor, was applied to a Cu, Ni sulfide concentrate analyzing 9 %Cu, the process had to be modified to a three-stage reactor by adding a sulfur chloride conversion unit. In this manner, operational {{problems associated with the}} formation of Cu-Fe chloride eutectics and sulfur chlorides could be circumvented. When the process was extended to a 29 %Cu chalcopyrite concentrate, the use of excess oxygen was found to be necessary to stabilize the operation of the oxidation reactor. A flowsheet was further modified to separate the chlorination and selective oxidation units with separate flow paths of fluidizing gases, thereby preventing the oxidation of sulfide feed in the chlorination reactor. Leaching of selectively-oxidized samples produced solutions analyzing Cu concentrations in excess of 100 g/L with Fe/Cu ratios of less than 0. 03 and with Cu extractions of over 99 %. Leach residues were readily filterable with cake moisture contents of 20 to 25 %...|$|R

50|$|The green patina {{that forms}} {{naturally}} on copper and bronze, sometimes called verdigris, usually consists of varying mixtures of <b>copper</b> <b>chlorides,</b> sulfides, sulfates and carbonates, depending upon environmental {{conditions such as}} sulfur-containing acid rain. In clean air rural environments, the patina is created by the slow chemical reaction of copper with carbon dioxide and water, producing a basic copper carbonate.

5000|$|Bronzes are {{typically}} very ductile alloys. By way of comparison, most bronzes are considerably less brittle than cast iron.

5000|$|Further {{complicating the}} Wacker process {{mechanism}} is {{questions about the}} role of <b>copper</b> <b>chloride.</b> Most theories assumed copper does not {{play a role in the}} olefin oxidation mechanisms. Yet, experiments by Stangl and Jira found chlorohydrin formation was dependent on <b>copper</b> <b>chloride</b> concentrations. Work by Hosokawa and coworkers yielded a crystallized product containing <b>copper</b> <b>chloride,</b> indicating it may have a non-innocent role in olefin oxidation. Finally, an ab initio study by Comas-Vives, et al. [...] involving no copper co-catalyst found anti-addition was the preferred pathway. This pathway was later confirmed by copper-free experiments by Anderson and Sigman. Interestingly, a different kinetic rate law with no proton dependence was found under copper-free conditions, indicating the possibility that even small amounts of copper co-catalysts may have non-innocent roles on this chemistry. While these works complicate the picture of the Wacker process mechanism, one should probably infer that this and related chemistry can be sensitive to reaction conditions, and multiple different reaction pathways may be in play.|$|E
