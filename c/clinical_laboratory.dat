40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 <b>Clinical</b> <b>laboratories</b> play a {{critical}} role in patient diagnosis, treatment planning and prevention of disease. The inherent complexity of <b>clinical</b> <b>laboratories</b> lies both in the volume and variety of specimen types, which varies by time of day/week and hospital census; different handling and processing requirements based on patient characteristics; the diversity of lab equipment and specialized instruments to perform the tests; and the requirements for appropriately credentialed staff on a 24 / 7 schedule. Although <b>clinical</b> <b>laboratories</b> reflect many aspects of traditional production systems, the medical profession is, as are most specialized areas of practice, much more willing to entertain modeling approaches that describe their systems with domain-appropriate terminology and semantics. This thesis discusses the development of a framework for creating domain-specific simulation objects for modeling <b>clinical</b> <b>laboratories.</b> These objects are developed based on the chemistry laboratory at Seattle Children's Hospital. In addition, three case studies are conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the objects...|$|R

Methods: A checklist was prepared to monitor the preanalytical, analytical and postanalytical stages of laboratory performance management in 16 areas and all laboratory activities in 14 of the <b>clinical</b> <b>laboratories</b> of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) hospitals. Collected data were stored and statistically analyzed using SPSS software. Results: The best performance, in which 77. 73 % of quality assurance indicators were observed, was found in Sina Hospital. However, only 57. 56 % of these indicators were fulfilled at Farabi Hospital, with the lowest-level performance among the <b>clinical</b> <b>laboratories</b> of TUMS hospitals. The highest level of compliance with quality assurance indicators was in the hematology departments and for facility demands in management areas. Overall, quality assurance indicators were appropriately followed in only 7 % of the <b>clinical</b> <b>laboratories.</b> Conclusion: The average quality assurance observation rate in the <b>clinical</b> <b>laboratories</b> studied was 67. 22 %, which is insufficient and must be remedied with stricter enforcement of the ISO 9001 : 2000 regulations...|$|R
