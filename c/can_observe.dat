5|$|Now {{under the}} {{management}} of the Asa Wright Nature Center, the William Beebe Tropical Research Station has gradually been renovated. It is now once again actively involved in research and an important gathering place for scientists. It is also a popular destination for birdwatchers, who <b>can</b> <b>observe</b> the same populations of hummingbirds, tanagers and oilbirds that William Beebe studied decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet and X-ray telescopes <b>can</b> <b>observe</b> highly {{energetic}} galactic phenomena. Ultraviolet flares {{are sometimes}} observed when {{a star in}} a distant galaxy is torn apart from the tidal forces of a nearby black hole. The distribution of hot gas in galactic clusters can be mapped by X-rays. The existence of supermassive black holes at the cores of galaxies was confirmed through X-ray astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its size}} and {{geologic}} features such as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse landscapes that resemble both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions. Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts, less than 10% of Texas' land area is desert. Most of the population centers are located in areas of former prairies, grasslands, forests, and the coastline. Traveling from east to west, one <b>can</b> <b>observe</b> terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods, to rolling plains and rugged hills, and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend.|$|E

5|$|The {{behavior}} {{of matter and}} energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined physical laws. These laws have been employed to produce cosmological models that successfully explain the structure {{and the evolution of}} the universe we <b>can</b> <b>observe.</b> The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty physical constants that appear to be static across the observable universe. The values of these constants have been carefully measured, but the reason for their specific values remains a mystery.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} rate of supernova production in a galaxy {{the size of}} the Milky Way is about one every 50years. This is much higher than the actual observed rate, implying that a portion of these events have been obscured from the Earth by interstellar dust. The deployment of new instruments that <b>can</b> <b>observe</b> across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, along with neutrino detectors, means that the next such event will almost certainly be detected.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the Universe and its {{contents}} have evolved; for example, the relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed and space itself has expanded. Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth <b>can</b> <b>observe</b> the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion {{is consistent with the}} observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted; the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey. Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is accelerating.|$|E

5|$|In general, a Vortigaunt is a {{somewhat}} humanoid figure with two legs and two arms, but has an additional arm protruding from its thorax. Vortigaunts have mottled green skin and digitigrade legs, {{allowing them to}} move quickly. Typically, Vortigaunts have a slightly hunched posture. In addition, Vortigaunts have sharp teeth, clawed hands, strong senses, and their faces are dominated by a large red eye. In Half-Life, this eye is surrounded by five smaller eyes, although, in Half-Life 2, this {{has been reduced to}} three smaller eyes. A key aspect of the Vortigaunts is their ability to summon energy to their command without the need for any equipment. In-game, this ability is most commonly used as a means of attack, with Vortigaunts' hurling the energy towards foes in the form of green electrical bolts. In addition, Vortigaunts {{have been shown to be}} able to use the energy for other purposes, such as assisting in repair work, removing rubble and blockages, recharging the player's HEV suit or powering up electrical generators. Enslaved Vortigaunts are depicted with green collars and shackles, although the means by which these control Vortigaunts is not explored. Vortigaunts are not typically seen wearing clothing, although several Vortigaunts are observed wearing lab coats and chef's clothing in the course of Half-Life 2 and its expansions. Vortigaunts are depicted as meat eaters; the player <b>can</b> <b>observe</b> Vortigaunts' eating human corpses in Half-Life and cooking headcrabs in Half-Life 2, although Half-Life 2 also shows Vortigaunts working in kitchens with chef hats, preparing soups and salads, suggesting that Vortigaunts are omnivores.|$|E
5|$|Newton (test plate) {{interferometry}} {{is frequently}} {{used in the}} optical industry for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured. Fig.13 shows photos of reference flats being used to check two test flats {{at different stages of}} completion, showing the different patterns of interference fringes. The reference flats are resting with their bottom surfaces in contact with the test flats, and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source. The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere, resulting in a pattern of bright and dark bands. The surface in the left photo is nearly flat, indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference fringes at equal intervals. The surface in the right photo is uneven, resulting in a pattern of curved fringes. Each pair of adjacent fringes represents a difference in surface elevation of half a wavelength of the light used, so differences in elevation can be measured by counting the fringes. The flatness of the surfaces can be measured to millionths of an inch by this method. To determine whether the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference optical flat, any of several procedures may be adopted. One <b>can</b> <b>observe</b> how the fringes are displaced when one presses gently on the top flat. If one observes the fringes in white light, the sequence of colors becomes familiar with experience and aids in interpretation. Finally one may compare the appearance of the fringes as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing position. These sorts of maneuvers, while common in the optical shop, are not suitable in a formal testing environment. When the flats are ready for sale, they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal testing and certification.|$|E

50|$|In humans, the dorsal bud <b>can</b> be <b>observed</b> 26 days post-fertilization. However, the {{islet cells}} <b>can</b> only be <b>observed</b> at 52 days post-fertilization. The {{development}} of beta cells precedes {{that of the}} development of other endocrine cells in the islets. All islet cells <b>can</b> be <b>observed</b> in the first trimester in human. This variation in the development of islet cell subtypes is due to differential gene expression and induction pathways of progenitor cells.|$|R

25|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) allow cognitive neuroscientists to explore different hypotheses concerning the neural network organization of semantic memory. By using these neuroimaging techniques researchers <b>can</b> <b>observe</b> the brain activity of participants while they perform cognitive tasks.

However, they are less able to segregate background effects from cosmic rays than can air Cherenkov telescopes. EAS arrays employ plastic scintillators in order to detect particles.|$|E
