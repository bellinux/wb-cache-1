Each botanical garden naturally develops its own special fields of interests depending on its personnel, location, extent, available funds, and the terms of its charter. It may include greenhouses, test grounds, an herbarium, an arboretum, and other departments. It maintains a scientific as well as a plant-growing staff, and publication is one of its major modes of expression.|$|E

5|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} vehicles (AUVs) and {{remotely operated}} underwater vehicles (ROVs) can carry out some functions of divers. They can be deployed at greater depths and in more dangerous environments. An AUV is a robot which travels underwater without requiring real-time input from an operator. AUVs constitute {{part of a}} larger group of unmanned undersea systems, a classification that includes non-autonomous ROVs, which are <b>controlled</b> <b>and</b> powered from the surface by an operator/pilot via an umbilical or using remote control. In military applications AUVs are often referred to as unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs).|$|E
5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} is {{the study}} of the chemical reactions that are catalysed by enzymes. In enzyme kinetics, the reaction rate is measured and the effects of varying the conditions of the reaction are investigated. Studying an enzyme's kinetics in this way can reveal the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme, its role in metabolism, how its activity is <b>controlled,</b> <b>and</b> how a drug or an agonist might inhibit the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the Non-Intervention Committee was created to uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing of the USSR and Germany had already become apparent.

In Britain, part of the reasoning was based on an exaggerated belief in Germany's and Italy's preparedness for war.|$|E

5|$|The plumage colour is genetically <b>controlled,</b> <b>and</b> {{studies in}} Finland and Italy {{indicate}} that grey-morph tawny owls have more reproductive success, better immune resistance, and fewer parasites than brown birds. Although this {{might suggest that}} eventually the brown morph could disappear, the owls show no colour preference when choosing a mate, so the adverse selection pressure is reduced. There are also environmental factors involved. The Italian study showed that brown-morph birds were found in denser woodland, and in Finland, Gloger's rule would suggest that paler birds would in any case predominate in the colder climate.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} is high risk as a diver suffering from DCS may become paralysed, unconscious or stop breathing whilst under water. Any {{one of these}} events may result in the diver drowning or further injury to the diver during a subsequent rescue to the surface. These risks can be mitigated to some extent by using a helmet or full-face mask with voice communications on the diver, and suspending the diver from the surface so that depth is positively <b>controlled,</b> <b>and</b> by having an in-water standby diver attend the diver undergoing the treatment at all times.|$|E

5|$|Turkey Tolson's {{painting}} style {{developed in}} two broad phases. His early work was classical, tightly <b>controlled</b> <b>and</b> {{with a strong}} sense of symmetry characterising the geometrical arrangement of symbols and the patterns of dots surrounding them. Works from the mid-1970s, painted at Papunya, show this iconography. They include Dreaming at Kamparrarrpa (Kampurarrpa) (1976), Kampurrarrpa (Kampurarrpa) (1976) Two Women Mythology at Putja Rockhole (1977), and Tjunyinkya (1977), all held by the National Museum of Australia, and all painted in synthetic polymer paint. Turkey Tolson collaborated with Johnny Scobie Tjapanangka, a fellow Papunya artist, in creating the last of the works.|$|E

For this reason, they generally refused to have their puppets meet and greet children at the theme parks in case a WALL-E trod on a child's foot. Those who wanted to take a photograph with the character had to make do with a cardboard cutout.|$|E
5|$|Welfare was expanded, as {{characterized}} {{by the introduction of}} non-contributory old-age pensions and payments to mothers provided their babies are taken for health checks and that their children attend school. Hundreds of free tractors were also handed out. The prices of gas and many foodstuffs were <b>controlled,</b> <b>and</b> local food producers were made to sell in the local market rather than export. A new state-owned body was also set up to distribute food at subsidized prices. All these measures helped to curb inflation, while the economy grew (partly because of rising public spending), accompanied by stronger public finances which brought economic stability.|$|E

5|$|While {{the goddess}} is a mature sixteen-year old who has conquered her ego and awakened her kundalini, the attendants are {{described}} as spiritually immature twelve-year olds who are sustained on the goddess's blood and have not become liberated from the delusion of duality. In portrayals where the goddess's hair is tied like a matron and her attendants have free-flowing hair like young girls, the goddess is treated as a motherly figure of regal authority and power; the tied hair and headlessness represent contrasting ideas of <b>controlled</b> <b>and</b> uncontrolled nature, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{broadcasts}} of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Voice of America to Central and Eastern Europe, a major propaganda effort begun in 1949 was Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, dedicated to bringing about the peaceful {{demise of the}} communist system in the Eastern Bloc. Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving as a surrogate home radio station, {{an alternative to the}} <b>controlled</b> <b>and</b> party-dominated domestic press. Radio Free Europe was a product {{of some of the most}} prominent architects of America's early Cold War strategy, especially those who believed that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means, such as George F.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1860s, Levski {{developed}} a revolutionary theory that saw the Bulgarian liberation movement as an armed uprising of all Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire. The insurrection was to be prepared, <b>controlled</b> <b>and</b> coordinated internally by a central revolutionary organisation, which was to include local revolutionary committees in all parts of Bulgaria and operate independently from any foreign factors. Levski's theory resulted from the repeated failures to implement Rakovski's ideas effectively, {{such as the use of}} foreign-based armed detachments (чети, cheti) to provoke a general revolt. Levski's idea of an entirely independent revolution did not enjoy the approval of the entire population either—in fact, he was the only prominent Bulgarian revolutionary to advocate it. Instead, many regarded an intervention by the great powers as a more feasible solution.|$|E

5|$|Between 1870 and 1873, chemist and {{physicist}} William Crookes conducted {{experiments to}} determine {{the validity of the}} phenomena produced by three mediums: Florence Cook, Kate Fox, and Home. Crookes' final report in 1874 concluded that the phenomena produced by all three mediums were genuine, a result which was roundly derided by the scientific establishment. Crookes recorded that he <b>controlled</b> <b>and</b> secured Home by placing his feet on the top of Home's feet. Crooke's method of foot control later proved inadequate when used with Eusapia Palladino, as she merely slipped her foot out and into her sturdy shoe. In addition, Crookes' motives, methods, and conclusions with regard to Florence Cook were called into question, both at the time and subsequently, casting doubt on his conclusions about Home. In a series of experiments in London at the house of Crookes in February 1875, the medium Anna Eva Fay managed to fool Crookes into believing she had genuine psychic powers. Fay later confessed to her fraud and revealed the tricks she had used.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} for {{thousands}} of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 to drain the wetlands and develop the land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed, water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly <b>controlled</b> <b>and</b> diverted to enable explosive growth of the South Florida metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal building projects were initiated across South Florida. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in South Florida.|$|E
5|$|If {{they could}} quickly capture the Esdraelon Plain {{while the two}} Ottoman armies were {{fighting}} in the Judean Hills against the XXI Corps infantry in the Battle of Sharon, and the XX Corps infantry in the Battle of Nablus, the railways could be cut, the roads <b>controlled,</b> <b>and</b> the lines of retreat across the plain for these two Ottoman armies west of the Jordan would be virtually cut. Success depended on the rapid capture of the communications hub at Afulah and the Yildirim Army Group's general headquarters at Nazareth which would disrupt communication and simultaneously almost surround the Eighth Army and cut the communications and supply lines to both the Seventh and Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills. (See Falls Map 21 below which shows these cavalry advances.) Success required that the cavalry not only capture but hold Afulah, Nazareth, and the Esdraelon Plain for some time. The men and horses of three cavalry divisions would be dependent on rations being quickly and efficiently transported forward many miles from their base.|$|E
