5|$|Mary's {{investigation}} {{leads her}} to Jacqueline's secret husband, Gregory Ward (Hugh Beaumont); a failed poet, Jason Hoag (Erford Gage); and a mysterious psychiatrist, Dr. Louis Judd (Tom Conway). Jacqueline had been Judd's patient, seeking treatment for depression stemming from her {{membership in a}} Satanic cult called the Palladists. She was lured into joining the cult by her former co-workers. Mary enlists a private detective, Irving August (Lou Lubin), but he is stabbed to death while investigating at the La Sagesse headquarters. Judd eventually helps Mary locate Jacqueline, who has gone into hiding. Gregory Ward {{falls in love with}} Mary. Jacqueline is later kidnapped by the <b>cult</b> <b>members</b> and condemned to death for revealing the cult. She would be the seventh person so condemned since the founding of the cult (hence the film's title).|$|E
5|$|The <b>cult</b> <b>members,</b> squeamish about {{committing}} acts of violence, {{decide that}} Jacqueline, who is suicidal, should kill herself. When she refuses, they let her leave, but send an assassin to follow her. The assassin chases {{her through the}} darkened streets with a switchblade, but she eludes him and returns to her apartment above Dante's. She briefly encounters her neighbor, Mimi (Elizabeth Russell), {{a young woman with}} a terminal illness. Mimi confesses to Jacqueline that she's afraid to die, and plans to have one last night out on the town. Jacqueline enters her own apartment and hangs herself. The thud of the chair falling over is heard, but the sick woman does not recognize the sound as she leaves for the evening.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} the season, Lydecker is {{betrayed by}} his superior, Elizabeth Renfro, and {{subsequently}} defects from Manticore. He aids Max in an assault on the Manticore headquarters, though Max is badly wounded and captured. In season two Cale exposes Manticore to the world, and Renfro torches the facility in an attempt to cover up the evidence, though she is killed in the process. Max escapes the facility and frees hundreds of other super soldiers and failed Manticore experiments. Lydecker disappears under mysterious circumstances. National Security Agency agent Ames White, who {{is also a member of}} a secretive cult that wishes to eliminate transgenics, is tasked with recapturing the Manticore escapees. Both the authorities and <b>cult</b> <b>members</b> pursue Max, though she escapes to Terminal City, an abandoned part of Seattle where hundreds of outcast transgenics have been hiding. When the police begin to surround Terminal City, Max convinces the other transgenics to stand their ground rather than run. The second and final season ends with the military surrounding and possibly preparing to invade Terminal City.|$|E
5|$|When {{transferred}} to a secret underwater government base, Osborn takes steps to ensure his release from prison. He uses a group of followers known as the 'Green Goblin Cult' to break out {{with the aid of}} corrupt senators; he plans to turn himself in after killing his fellow escapees, setting him up as a 'champion' of the judicial system. After the breakout he awaits his trial in a new prison, this one controlled by his <b>cult</b> <b>members.</b> Using his staged persona as a voice for the 'disenfranchised', Osborn plans to regain the Iron Patriot armor and creates a new team of Dark Avengers, this time substituting June Covington for Scarlet Witch, Ai Apaec for Spider-Man, Barney Barton for Hawkeye, Skaar for Hulk, Superia for Ms. Marvel, Gorgon for Wolverine and an A.I.M.-rebuilt Ragnarok for Thor. In the team's first fight with the New Avengers, Osborn reveals he has the Super-Adaptoid's powers, declares himself the head of world security, and orders that the Avengers be arrested for war crimes. However, double agent Skaar betrays Osborn, allowing the Avengers to dogpile Osborn's body, overloading him with superpowers and sending him into a coma. A.I.M. and HYDRA pick up Osborn's leftover resources, and H.A.M.M.E.R. is disbanded. After the Hobgoblin returns to New York, a nurse and doctor are called to Norman's hospital room, only to find him gone.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} cases where local authorities have refused to accept resident registration for <b>cult</b> <b>members</b> when it is discovered that Aleph {{has set up a}} facility within their jurisdiction. This effectively denies <b>cult</b> <b>members</b> social benefits such as health insurance; five cases have been taken to court by <b>cult</b> <b>members,</b> who won every time. Local communities also try to drive the cult away by preventing cultists from finding jobs, or keeping cult children out of schools. Right-wing groups frequently conduct protest marches near apartments rented by Aum followers by blaring extremely loud music through loudspeakers installed on minivans.|$|E

25|$|After {{the bodies}} were {{discovered}} on April 11, 1989, Constanzo fled to Mexico City but was eventually tracked down. As the police surrounded his apartment complex, Constanzo died after ordering one of the <b>cult</b> <b>members</b> to kill him with a machine gun. Sara Aldrete, another high-ranking member of the cult, was arrested at the scene along with several others. In 1993, the <b>cult</b> <b>members</b> were found guilty {{of a number of}} charges, including capital murder and drug trafficking. Several of them, however, claimed they were not guilty of Kilroy's murder and told the press they were tortured to confess. Only two suspects remain at large.|$|E
25|$|The cult started {{attracting}} {{controversy in}} the late 1980s with accusations of deception of recruits, and of holding <b>cult</b> <b>members</b> against their will and forcing members to donate money; it murdered a cult member who tried to leave in February 1989.|$|E

25|$|Flickinger {{recorded}} {{a number of}} 'unusual' incidents and circumstantial evidence, {{but was unable to}} find sufficient evidence of cult involvement for the ATF to take further action. Media reports of the time reported his investigation was dropped when it was determined cattle deaths were not a prelude to a co-ordinated campaign against elected officials by <b>cult</b> <b>members.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{a form of}} {{sympathetic}} magic, many built life-size {{replicas of}} airplanes out of straw and cut new military-style landing strips out of the jungle, hoping to attract more airplanes. The <b>cult</b> <b>members</b> thought that the foreigners had some special connection to the deities and ancestors of the natives, who were the only beings powerful enough to produce such riches.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the modern}} {{manufacturing}} process is unknown to them, members, leaders, and prophets of the cults {{maintain that the}} manufactured goods of the non-native culture have been created by spiritual means, such as through their deities and ancestors. These goods are intended for the local indigenous people, but the foreigners have unfairly gained control of these objects through malice or mistake. Thus, a characteristic feature of cargo cults {{is the belief that}} spiritual agents will, at some future time, give much valuable cargo and desirable manufactured products to the <b>cult</b> <b>members.</b>|$|E

25|$|Throughout the night, Kilroy was {{tortured}} and sodomized. He was then led {{out to the}} field and Constanzo killed him by chopping {{the back of his}} neck and head with a machete. His brain was then boiled on a nganga, an African metal pot that Constanzo used to stew human and animal remains. Kilroy's limbs were chopped off above his knees to facilitate his burial. A wire was inserted in his spinal cord to pull the bones out once the body decomposed. The <b>cult</b> <b>members</b> then dug a hole on the grounds and buried Kilroy's corpse.|$|E
25|$|Police {{also found}} {{laboratories}} to manufacture {{drugs such as}} LSD, methamphetamine, and a crude form of truth serum, a safe containing millions of U.S. dollars in cash and gold, and cells, many still containing prisoners. During the raids, Aum issued statements claiming that the chemicals were for fertilizers. Over the next six weeks, over 150 <b>cult</b> <b>members</b> were arrested {{for a variety of}} offenses. The media was stationed outside Aum's Tokyo headquarters on Komazawa Dori in Aoyama for months after the attack and arrests waiting for action and to get images of the cult's other members.|$|E
25|$|When media {{coverage}} and allegations of Constanzo's affinity towards Satanism died down, several Afro-Caribbean scholars stated that Constanzo's actions were fueled by his personal conviction and psychopathic involvement with Palo Mayombe. They argued that Constanzo used Palo Mayombe {{for his own}} financial, illicit, and psychological needs by convincing his <b>cult</b> <b>members</b> to help further his drug trafficking operations. Through human sacrifice, Constanzo promised his members that they were protected from the law. Other Afro-Caribbean scholars, on the other hand, alleged that Constanzo murdered Kilroy because he truly believed it was a requirement in his distorted view of Palo Mayombe. From this point of view, Constanzo's actions and what happened in Matamoros could happened anywhere.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, Berkowitz {{first made}} these claims known when he {{announced}} to the press that he had only killed three of the Son of Sam victims: Donna Lauria, Alexander Esau and Valentina Suriani. In this revised confession, Berkowitz says that other shooters were involved and that he personally fired the gun only in the first attack (Lauria and Valenti) and the sixth (Esau and Suriani). He says that he and several other <b>cult</b> <b>members</b> were involved in every incident by planning the events, providing early surveillance of the victims, and acting as lookouts and drivers at the crime scenes. Berkowitz states that he cannot divulge the names of most of his accomplices without putting his family directly at risk.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, {{the detainees}} {{were taken to}} the {{headquarters}} of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police in Matamoros for an informal press conference. More than 250 international journalists arrived at the scene to take pictures and ask them questions. The four suspects were paraded from the building's balcony and were allowed to answer questions from reporters. Elio stated that he was an ordained executioner under Constanzo and that Kilroy was murdered by Constanzo. As the cameras zoomed in on the suspects, Elio showed his membership scars on his shoulders, back, arms, and chest. These were arrow-like cuts made with a hot blade. The marks were given to selected <b>cult</b> <b>members</b> with the authority to perform human sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|In October 1989, the group's {{negotiations}} with Tsutsumi Sakamoto, an anti-cult lawyer threatening {{a lawsuit against}} them which could potentially bankrupt the group, failed. In the same month, Sakamoto recorded an interview for a talk show on the Japanese TV station TBS. The network then had the interview secretly shown to the group without notifying Sakamoto, intentionally breaking protection of sources. The group then pressured TBS to cancel the broadcast. The following month Sakamoto, {{his wife and his}} child went missing from their home in Yokohama. The police were unable to resolve the case at the time, although some of his colleagues publicly voiced their suspicions of the group. It was not until after the 1995 Tokyo attack that they were known to have been murdered and their bodies dumped by <b>cult</b> <b>members.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} shown to have {{influenced}} the Santería-based cult established by Adolfo Constanzo and supported by Sara Aldrete in Matamoros, Mexico.

She uses a special drug to poison the <b>cult's</b> <b>members.</b> When Zhang demands that she gives him the antidote, she makes him promise to help her do three things in exchange for the antidote. At the same time, Yin Tianzheng and the <b>cult's</b> <b>members,</b> who mistakenly think that the Shaolin Sect was behind the poisoning, go to Shaolin Monastery to take revenge but, to their surprise, they see corpses everywhere.|$|R
