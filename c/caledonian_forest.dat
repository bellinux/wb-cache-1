5|$|The flora of Scotland is an {{assemblage}} of native plant species including over 1,600 vascular plants, more than 1,500 lichens and nearly 1,000 bryophytes. The total number of vascular species is low by world standard but lichens and bryophytes are abundant and the latter form a population of global importance. Various populations of rare fern exist, although the impact of 19th-century collectors threatened the existence of several species. The flora is generally typical of the north west European part of the Palearctic ecozone and prominent features of the Scottish flora include boreal <b>Caledonian</b> <b>forest</b> (much reduced from its natural extent), heather moorland and coastal machair. In addition to the native varieties of vascular plants there are numerous non-native introductions, now believed to make up some 43% of the species in the country.|$|E
5|$|On {{the high}} {{mountain}} tops, species including ptarmigan, mountain hare and stoat {{can be seen}} in their white colour phase during winter months. Remnants of the native Scots pine forest exist and within these areas the Scottish crossbill, the UK's only endemic bird species and vertebrate, can be found alongside capercaillie, Scottish wildcat, red squirrel and pine marten. Various animals have been re-introduced, including the white-tailed sea eagle in 1975, the red kite in the 1980s, and there have been experimental projects involving the beaver and wild boar. Today, much of the remaining native <b>Caledonian</b> <b>Forest</b> lies within the Cairngorms National Park and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest still remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in Argyll, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history.|$|E
50|$|The Scottish {{crossbill}} breeds in {{the native}} Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), <b>Caledonian</b> <b>forests</b> of the Scottish Highlands, but (perhaps surprisingly), often also in forestry plantations of exotic conifers, notably Larch (Larix decidua and L. kaempferi) and Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta).|$|R

25|$|The {{surviving}} pre-Roman {{accounts of}} Scotland originated with the Greek Pytheas of Massalia, {{who may have}} circumnavigated the British Isles of Albion (Britain) and Ierne (Ireland) sometime around 325. The most northerly point of Britain was called Orcas (Orkney). By the time of Pliny the Elder, who died in 79, Roman knowledge of the geography of Scotland had extended to the Hebudes (The Hebrides), Dumna (probably the Outer Hebrides), the <b>Caledonian</b> <b>Forest</b> {{and the people of}} the Caledonii, from whom the Romans named the region north of their control Caledonia. Ptolemy, possibly drawing on earlier sources of information as well as more contemporary accounts from the Agricolan invasion, identified 18 tribes in Scotland in his Geography, but many of the names are obscure and the geography becomes less reliable in the north and west, suggesting early Roman knowledge of these area was confined to observations from the sea.|$|E
500|$|The Romans' {{part in the}} {{clearances}} of {{the once}} extensive <b>Caledonian</b> <b>forest</b> remains a matter of debate. That these forests were once considerably more extensive {{than they are now}} is not in dispute, but the timing and causes of the reduction are. The 16th-century writer Hector Boece believed that the woods in Roman times stretched north from Stirling into Atholl and Lochaber and was inhabited by white bulls with [...] "crisp and curland mane, like feirs lionis". Later historians such as P. F. Tytler and W. F. Skene followed suit as did the 20th-century naturalist Frank Fraser Darling. Modern techniques, including palynology and dendrochronology suggest a more complex picture. Changing post-glacial climates may have allowed for a maximum forest cover between 4000 and 3000 and deforestation of the Southern uplands, caused both climatically and anthropogenically, was well underway by the time the legions arrived. Extensive analyses of Black Loch in Fife suggest that arable land spread at the expense of forest from about 2000 until the 1st-century Roman advance. Thereafter, there was re-growth of birch, oak and hazel for a period of five centuries, suggesting the invasions had a very negative impact on the native population. The situation outside the Roman-held areas is harder to assess, but the long-term influence of Rome may not have been substantial.|$|E
2500|$|The 9th-century Irish tale Buile Shuibhne (The Madness of Sweeney) {{describes}} how Shuibhne or Sweeney, the pagan {{king of the}} Dál nAraidi in Ulster, assaults the Christian bishop Ronan Finn and is cursed with madness as a result. He begins to grow feathers and talons as the curse runs its full course, flies like a bird and spends many years travelling naked through the woods, composing verses among other madmen. In order to be forgiven by God, King Buile Suibhne composes a beautiful poem of praise to God before he dies. [...] There are further poems and stories recounting the life and madness of King Suibhne. The Welsh told a similar story about Myrddin Wyllt, {{the origin of the}} Merlin of later romance. In these stories Myrddin is a warrior in the service of King Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio {{at the time of the}} Battle of Arfderydd. When his lord is killed at the battle, Myrddin travels to the <b>Caledonian</b> <b>Forest</b> in a fit of madness which endows him with the ability to compose prophetic poetry; a number of later prophetic poems are attributed to him. The Life of Saint Kentigern includes almost the same story, though here the madman of Arfderydd is instead named Lailoken, which may be the original name. The fragmentary 16th-century Breton text An Dialog Etre Arzur Roe D'an Bretounet Ha Guynglaff (Dialog Between Arthur and Guynglaff) tells of a meeting between King Arthur and the wild man Guynglaff, who predicts events which will occur as late as the 16th century.|$|E

60|$|The {{period of}} this tale {{is in the}} heat of the killing-time; the scene laid for the most part in solitary hills and morasses, haunted only by the {{so-called}} Mountain Wanderers, the dragoons that came in chase of them, the women that wept on their dead bodies, and the wild birds of the moorland that have cried there since the beginning. It is a land of many rain-clouds; a land of much mute history, written there in pre-historic symbols. Strange green raths are to be seen commonly in the country, above all by the kirkyards; barrows of the dead, standing stones; beside these, the faint, durable footprints and handmarks of the Roman; and an antiquity older perhaps than any, and still living and active--a complete Celtic nomenclature and a scarce-mingled Celtic population. These rugged and grey hills were once included in the boundaries of the <b>Caledonian</b> <b>Forest.</b> Merlin sat here below his apple-tree and lamented Gwendolen; here spoke with Kentigern; here fell into his enchanted trance. And the legend of his slumber seems to body forth the story of that Celtic race, deprived for so many centuries of their authentic speech, surviving with their ancestral inheritance of melancholy perversity and patient, unfortunate courage.|$|E

40|$|New Caledonia, an {{archipelago}} {{situated in}} the South-West Pacific Ocean has a very high biodiversity of which many flora and fauna species are endemic, and is therefore considered {{as one of the}} world hotspots for the biodiversity conservation. Sclerophyll forests, one of the five main vegetation types occurring on the island are mainly threatened by anthropogenic activities. Rusa deer (Cervus timorensis russa) were introduced into New Caledonia from Java in 1870. They have colonised all the biotopes of the main island, and represent one of the major threats to the New <b>Caledonian</b> sclerophyll <b>forests.</b> Currently, there is a lack of management tools to monitor the trends of rusa deer in New <b>Caledonian</b> sclerophyll <b>forests.</b> To test monitoring methods for use as management tools, six sclerophyll forests study sites were studied using direct census methods (i. e. spotlight count and drive count), indirect census methods (i. e. faecal standing crop method) and three indices (i. e. the faecal pellet groups index, the browsing index and the antler rubbing index). The faecal pellet groups index is based on sampling pellet groups in plots along transects. To ensure reliable data collection with a coefficient of variation of the mean number of intact faecal pellet groups per plot per transect of less than 20 percent, my study indicated that 15 plots per transect and 20 transects per sites should be sampled in New <b>Caledonian</b> sclerophyll <b>forests</b> whereas previous studies conducted in New Zealand indicated that a minimum of 25 plots per transect and of 18 transects per site should be sampled. The advantages of reducing the number of plots per transect and of transects per site is that it reduces the expenses (e. g. time, finance) and the bias due to data collection (e. g. fatigue, boredom and visual activity) which will improve the precision of the data recorded. Estimates of rusa deer density obtained from the census methods were not correlated (r = - 0. 425, df = 4, P = 0. 401) due to my small sample size. The reliability of these estimates is questionable because of biases. Previous publications have shown that biases are difficult to avoid when using direct census methods and that it is difficult to estimate the size of animal populations with accuracy and precision. The faecal standing crop method was subjected to bias because the estimation of the decay rate and the defecation rate were unreliable. These methods were not recommended for rusa deer management in New <b>Caledonian</b> sclerophyll <b>forests.</b> Of the three indices tested, the faecal pellet groups index and the browsing index based on unpalatable browse species were the most reliable as the confidence intervals of these two indices were small (i. e. from ± 0. 08 to ± 0. 11 for the faecal pellet groups index; from ± 0. 04 to ± 0. 27 for the browsing index of unpalatable browse species), and they also showed significant correlations with a subjective ranking of the rusa deer density based on expert knowledge (rs = 0. 829, df = 4, P = 0. 042 and rs = 0. 829, df = 4, P = 0. 042 respectively). These two indices appear to show the most promise for use as management tools, as they could reliably track local variations of rusa deer densities on the sclerophyll forests. These two indices could be used by wildlife technicians in New Caledonia to establish management plans of rusa deer populations which rely on participative management involving the stakeholders (e. g. hunters, forest managers, local communities). We believe that the faecal pellet groups index and the browsing index could be useful to monitor rusa deer populations in New <b>Caledonian</b> sclerophyll <b>forests,</b> and meet conservation and hunting objectives of the local population and authorities. Management tools such as culling and hunting operations will be implemented in New <b>Caledonian</b> sclerophyll <b>forests</b> where monitoring of indices I recommended show an increase in the deer population. Stakeholders will be involved in the implementation of the monitoring tools (i. e. indices) and of the management tools (e. g. culling and hunting operations, fencing) but also in decision making for the management of the rusa deer in New <b>Caledonian</b> sclerophyll <b>forest...</b>|$|R

50|$|The Dee is {{important}} for nature conservation and the area has many designated sites. The upper catchment is within the Cairngorms National Nature Reserve and (since 2003) Cairngorms National Park. Much of the semi-natural <b>Caledonian</b> pine <b>forest</b> in Scotland is within the Dee catchment.

60|$|Of these animals, the {{descendants}} of the savage herds which anciently roamed free in the <b>Caledonian</b> <b>forests,</b> it was formerly a point of state to preserve a few in the parks of the Scottish nobility. Specimens continued within the memory of man to be kept at least at three houses of distinction--Hamilton, namely, Drumlanrig, and Cumbernauld. They had degenerated from the ancient race in size and strength, if we are to judge from the accounts of old chronicles, and from the formidable remains frequently discovered in bogs and morasses when drained and laid open. The bull had lost the shaggy honours of his mane, and the race was small and light made, in colour a dingy white, or rather a pale yellow, with black horns and hoofs. They retained, however, in some measure, the ferocity of their ancestry, could not be domesticated on account of their antipathy to the human race, and were often dangerous if approached unguardedly, or wantonly disturbed. It was this last reason which has occasioned their being extirpated at the places we have mentioned, where probably they would otherwise have been retained as appropriate inhabitants of a Scottish woodland, and fit tenants for a baronial forest. A few, if I mistake not, are still preserved at Chillingham Castle, in Northumberland, the seat of the Earl of Tankerville.|$|R

40|$|Rewilding {{falls within}} the general {{framework}} of restoration ecology, but differs from a traditional view of habitat restoration and species reintroduction. Four initial steps are required to instigate a rewilding project: identification {{of the issue of}} conservation concern; identification of the missing ecological processes; identification of the functional characteristics required; and selection and reintroduction of the most suitable species. One method of progressing rewilding to a mainstream management option is to test a priori hypotheses with quantifiable outcomes within rewilding projects. Scenario planning and the 'three horizons' analysis allow long-term rewilding projects to be considered in three phases: the current, functionally deficient ecosystem in need of restoration; a projected future scenario where the ecosystem is restored to a functional and self-sustaining state; a transition state between the first and third horizons.
