Many species of cockroach harbor symbiotic protozoans and bacteria in their gut which are able to digest cellulose. In many species, these symbionts may be essential if the insect is to utilize cellulose; however, some species secrete cellulase in their saliva, and the wood-eating cockroach, Panesthia cribrata, is able to survive indefinitely on a diet of <b>crystallized</b> <b>cellulose</b> while being free of micro-organisms.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{regeneration}} of a solid, <b>crystallized</b> <b>cellulose</b> {{solution in}} a N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) -water mixture was studied {{by measuring the}} diffusion coefficient of both the water uptake from the regenerating bath and the NMMO outflow to this bath. The diffusion coefficient of water going to the cellulose solution is about 10 {{times larger than the}} diffusion coefficient of NMMO leaving the solution. This difference expresses the strongly hygroscopic character of NMMO. None of these coefficients depends on cellulose molecular weight showing that no major rearrangement of cellulose chains occurs {{at the beginning of the}} regeneration. The diffusion coefficient of water is not influenced by the cellulose concentration, whereas the diffusion coefficient of NMMO decreases strongly when the cellulose concentration increases. Extrapolating the diffusion coefficient of NMMO versus cellulose concentration to zero shows that the maximal concentration of cellulose in NMMO-water is about 15 %. Above this value, undissolved cellulose should be present. From the influence of the NMMO content in the water regenerating bath, it is possible to see that NMMO is removed from the solution if the bath has a NMMO content lower than 60 %, to be compared with the 80 % NMMO concentration in the solution. © 2005 American Chemical Society...|$|E
30|$|All {{the manure}} gels {{for the three}} {{different}} cross-linking agents had a signal observed at 3418.38  cm− 1, but at different intensities, this could either be due to OH groups from cellulose or NH stretching of urea units or both (Zhang et al. 2007 a, b). A weak band at 2933.3  cm− 1 {{was found in the}} glycerol and chicken dung-modified materials only and could be assigned to C–H stretch (Zhang et al. 2007 a, b). This is a confirmation modification, as urea does not have C–H bonds The absorption at 1643.17  cm− 1 is attributed to the system (C–O–C), skeletal mode vibration of α- 1, 4 -glycosidic linkage, the band at 1650.0  cm− 1 is due to water in the amorphous region, and the C–O–C ether bond shows stretching at 1042.4  cm− 1 (Peppas et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2007 a, b). The band at 1427.0  cm− 1 in all spectra indicated that all samples contained a mixture of <b>crystallized</b> <b>cellulose</b> and amorphous cellulose. The bands at 1369.0, 1315.0, and 1157.0  cm− 1 are assigned to CH stretching, CH 2 wagging, and C–O stretching in cellulose (Zhang et al. 2007 a, b). These results shows that the cow-dung molecules were cross-linked effectively by all the three cross-linking agents and that the chicken dung gels compared well with the commercial cross linkers.|$|E
40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{of highly}} polymerized biomass by microbial communities present in diverse microbial ecosystems is an indispensable metabolic process for biogeochemical cycling {{in nature and}} for industrial activities required to maintain a sustainable society. Therefore, {{the evaluation of the}} complicated microbial metabolomics presents a significant challenge. We here describe a comprehensive strategy for characterizing the degradation of highly <b>crystallized</b> bacterial <b>cellulose</b> (BC) that is accompanied by metabolite production for identifying the responsible biocatalysts, including microorganisms and their metabolic functions. To this end, we employed two-dimensional solid- and one-dimensional solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) profiling combined with a metagenomic approach using stable isotope labeling. The key components of biocatalytic reactions determined using a metagenomic approach were correlated with cellulose degradation and metabolic products. The results indicate that BC degradation was mediated by cellulases that contain carbohydrate-binding modules and that belong to structural type A. The degradation reactions induced the metabolic dynamics of the microbial community and produced organic compounds, such as acetic acid and propionic acid, mainly metabolized by clostridial species. This combinatorial, functional and structural metagenomic approach is useful for the comprehensive characterization of biomass degradation, metabolic dynamics and their key components in diverse ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|The {{surface of}} ramie {{cellulose}} whiskers has been chemically modified by grafting organic acid chlorides presenting different lengths of the aliphatic chain by an esterification reaction. The {{occurrence of the}} chemical modification was evaluated by FTIR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, elemental analysis and contact angle measurements. The crystallinity of the particles was not altered by the chain grafting, but it was shown that covalently grafted chains were able to <b>crystallize</b> at the <b>cellulose</b> surface when using C 18. Both unmodified and functionalized nanoparticles were extruded with low density polyethylene to prepare nanocomposite materials. The homogeneity of the ensuing nanocomposites was found to increase with {{the length of the}} grafted chains. The thermomechanical properties of processed nanocomposites were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamical mechanical analysis (DMA) and tensile tests. A significant improvement in terms of elongation at break was observed when sufficiently long chains were grafted {{on the surface of the}} nanoparticles. It was ascribed to improved dispersion of the nanoparticles within the LDPE matrix. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Low {{composition}} of lignin and high of cellulose contains showed that banana stem wastes one of good sources for pulping purpose. These materials are cheap and can easy to get, since banana was planted widely in Malaysia for commercial used. After its harvesting, the banana stem are cut and usually {{left in the}} soil plantation {{to be used as}} organic material where actually, this crops can be used for more rational way of utilization, namely as a sources of cellulosic fibre for pulping process. Common chemical pulping process that had been used nowadays in industry frequently bring harms to the environment and also to human life as it consume and produce much of chemical reagent. Thus, the purpose of biological pretreatment using mixed culture from banana soil plantation with different Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) in this study is {{to reduce the amount of}} chemicals that will be used and produced from the chemical pulping process and also to reduce costs, energy consumption and time needed for the pulping process. The goal of biological pretreatment is to break lignin seal and disrupt the <b>crystallize</b> structure of <b>cellulose</b> in the banana stem waste and the different HRT that was used are 9, 19. 5 and 30 days where it is believed that different HRT has its own effect to the treatment process. From the experiment, the maximum amount that can be degraded is about 5. 5 % of lignin. The best HRT that been analyzed is HRT equal to 19. 5 days. The treated banana stem showed the positive result in chemical pulping process where percentages of lignin reduced is higher than untreated banana stem wastes...|$|R
30|$|For the softwood, the {{decrease}} of the absorbance at 1740  cm− 1 assigned to C=O stretching vibration of acetyl or carboxylic acid groups was compensated {{by an increase}} in the same groups derived mainly from lignin. The behavior of the band at 1430  cm− 1, which is characteristic of <b>crystallized</b> <b>cellulose</b> I, indicates that the amorphous area of the cellulosic component of both woods is more affected by the degradation process. Two great absorption decreases are apparent at 1236 and 1154  cm− 1. The first decrease belongs to the asymmetric stretching of ether bond, while the second belongs to the symmetric stretching of ether bond, the aromatic C–H deformation, and to the glucose ring vibration. These absorption decreases indicate the ether splitting and the degradation of cellulose [25]. The observed changes can be then summarized as formation of micro-cracks and destruction of the various layers of the cell wall. The samples were withdrawn from the device after different irradiation times ranging from 30 to 120  h. A material lack is also observed; Fig.  4 shows the wood mass loss, expressed as a percentage loss, against UV time exposure. After the first 30  h of light irradiation by xenon lamp, the mass loss increases sharply, and then the rises stabilize gradually for Maritime pine and zeen oak. On the other hand, the afares oak mass loss seems to increase steadily throughout the entire exposure time.|$|E
