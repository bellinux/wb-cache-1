40|$|In this {{research}} the diplomatic, <b>consular</b> and political <b>relations</b> between Iran and U. S. will be studied. In {{order to reach}} our goal and present {{a clear picture of}} these two countries relation, we will analyze this relation from its establishment to the current situation. The relation between Iran and the United States began in the mid-to-late 19 th century; at the beginning U. S. was considered as a powerful and reliable supporter for Iran, this relation became better after the war and during the government of Mohammad Mosadegh. But, everything changed in this relation between Iran and the United States after Iran revolution. The only worthy negotiation between these two nations during this time resulted in the ill-fated Iran-Contra Hostage crises. In other words, Iran and the United States have a complicated political relation and it is not easy for these two nations to negotiate with each other on a same topic in order to compromise and agree with each other...|$|R

Texas, the State of Texas {{against an}} attempt to re-open the cases of 51 Mexican nationals, {{all of whom were}} convicted of murder in the United States and were on death row. With the support of the George W. Bush Administration, the petitioners argued that the United States had violated the Vienna Convention on <b>Consular</b> <b>Relations</b> by failing to notify the convicted nationals of their opportunity to receive legal aid from the Mexican consulate. They based their case on a decision of the International Court of Justice in the Avena case which ruled that by failing to allow access to the Mexican consulate, the US had breached its obligations under the Convention. Texas won the case in a 6–3 decision, the Supreme Court holding that ICJ decisions were not binding in domestic law and that the President had no power to enforce them.|$|E

2500|$|Nancy J. Powell, the U.S. {{ambassador}} to India, resigned following the incident, which was widely seen by India [...] "as {{fallout from the}} imbroglio." [...] Some commentators suggested that the incident and response could lead to wider damage in U.S.-India relations. Former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha called for the arrest of same-sex companions of US diplomats, citing the Supreme Court of India's upholding of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code whereby homosexuality is illegal in India. Former State Department legal advisor John Bellinger questioned whether the decision to arrest and detain Khobragade was [...] "wise policy ... even if technically permissible" [...] under the Vienna Convention on <b>Consular</b> <b>Relations,</b> while Robert D.

2500|$|On June 27, 2001, the ICJ, rejecting {{all of the}} United States' arguments, {{ruled in}} favor of Germany. The ICJ held that the Vienna Convention on <b>Consular</b> <b>Relations</b> of 24 April 1963 (Vienna Convention) [...] granted rights to {{individuals}} {{on the basis of its}} plain meaning, and that domestic laws could not limit the rights of the accused under the convention, but only specify the means by which those rights were to be exercised. The ICJ also found that its own provisional measures were legally binding. The nature of provisional measures has been a subject of great dispute in international law; the English text of the Statute of the International Court of Justice implies they are not binding, while the French text implies that they are. Faced with a contradiction between two equally authentic texts of the statute, the court considered which interpretation better served the objects and purposes of the statute, and hence found that they are binding. This was the first time in the court's history it had ruled as such.|$|E
