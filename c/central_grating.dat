40|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{binocular}} rivalry occurs as a result of competition between monocular channels (eg eye competition). However, some recent literature favours a pattern competition account of rivalry, in which rivalry occurs between incompatible (binocular) pattern representations. In this current study, we investigated feature-specific aspects of dichoptic suppression. Three coloured gratings were presented simultaneously next to each other to one eye on a dichoptically presented grid. One of the two flanking gratings had the same colour and orientation as the <b>central</b> <b>grating.</b> All three gratings were suppressed by presenting high-contrast elements to the other eye. After 600 ms, the flanking suppressors were removed and the flanking gratings became visible. Results show that the grating dissimilar to the suppressed <b>central</b> <b>grating</b> became visible first, both for the intraocular and interocular condition. This is evidence for feature-specific inhibition during binocular suppression. These findings support the idea that all presented visual information reaches higher visual areas and favour a pattern competition account of binocular rivalry...|$|E

Using monocular, centrally fixated sinusoidal gratings surrounded by contiguous annuli of rivalrous gratings, suppression of the entire <b>central</b> <b>grating</b> was possible using either technique. However, the magnitude of the suppression was unaffected by the presence of an ipsilateral surround for flash suppression, yet, for binocular rivalry, suppression no longer occurred when the surrounds were fusible. Nevertheless, computational modeling demonstrates that the differences between the techniques may be attributable to the sustained versus transient stimulation of the contralateral surround, with the magnitude of the suppression proportional to the activation of the contralateral surround. Consistent with this, suppression extends over a greater distance {{at the onset of the}} contralateral surround than during sustained rivalry. Therefore, it is likely that perceptual dominance in both binocular rivalry and flash suppression is based on the same mechanism of interocular suppression...|$|E

Here, we demonstrate that an oriented surround grating {{can affect the}} perceived orientation of a <b>central</b> test <b>grating</b> [1] even when backward masking [2] of the surround prevents its orientation from being consciously perceived. The effect survives introduction of a gap between test and surround of over a degree even under masking, suggesting either that contextual information can effectively propagate across early visual cortex {{in the absence of}} awareness of the signaled context or that it can proceed undetected to higher processing levels at which such horizontal propagation may not be necessary. The effect under masking also shows partial interocular transfer, demonstrating processing of orientation by binocular neurons in visual cortex in the absence of conscious orientation perception. This pattern of results is consistent with the suggestion that simultaneous orientation contrast is mediated at multiple levels of the visual processing hierarchy [3 – 6], and it supports the view that propagation of signals to [7] and, possibly, back from [8 – 10] higher visual areas is necessary for conscious perception...|$|R

40|$|The {{activity}} of V 1 neurons evoked by stimuli within the classical receptive field (CRF) {{is known to}} be modulated by stimuli in the surrounding field, the extra-receptive field (ERF). By varying the relative spatial phase (RSP) between a <b>central</b> <b>grating</b> presented in the CRF and a surround grating in the ERF, we studied the contextual modulation in V 1 neurons of alert monkeys (Macaca mulata). Results from two monkeys show that most of the V 1 neurons with suppressive ERF are sensitive to the RSP, and the degree of sensitivity is strongly dependent on the strength of ERF suppression. This sensitivity is maximal when the RSP is generated at or near CRF/ERF boundary, but is observed over the entire ERF. Interestingly, the suppressive effect of the surround grating can be largely abolished by inserting a narrow gap between the center and surround gratings or by a phase displacement between them corresponding to < 10 % of the CRF diameter.

40|$|The {{effects of}} stimuli falling outside the 'classical {{receptive}} field' and {{their influence on}} the orientation selectivity of cells in the cat primary visual cortex are still matters of debate. Here we examine the variety of effects of such peripheral stimuli on responses to stimuli limited to the receptive field. We first determined {{the extent of the}} classical receptive field by increasing the diameter of a circular patch of drifting grating until the response saturated or reached a maximum, and by decreasing the diameter of a circular mask {{in the middle of an}} extended grating, centred on the receptive field, until the cell just began to respond. These two estimates always agreed closely. We then presented an optimum grating of medium-to-high contrast filling the classical receptive field while stimulating the surround with a drifting grating that had the same parameters as the central stimulus but was varied in orientation. For all but five neurons (of 37 tested), surround stimulation produced clear suppression over some range of orientations, while none showed explicit facilitation under these conditions. For 11 cells (34 % of those showing suppression), the magnitude of suppression did not vary consistently with the orientation of the surround stimulus. In the majority of cells, suppression was weakest for a surround grating oriented orthogonal to the cell's optimum. Nine of these cells (28 %) exhibited maximum inhibition at the optimum orientation for the receptive field itself, but for 12 cells (38 %) there was apparent 'release' from inhibition for surround gratings at or near the cell's optimum orientation and direction, leaving inhibition either maximal at angles flanking the optimum (9 cells) or broadly distributed over the rest of the orientation range (3 cells). This implies the existence of a subliminal facilitatory mechanism, tightly tuned at or near the cell's optimum orientation, extending outside the classical receptive field. For just two cells of 13 tested the preferred orientation for a <b>central</b> <b>grating</b> was clearly shifted towards the orientation of a surrounding grating tilted away from the cell's optimum. The contrast gain for central stimulation at the optimal orientation was measured with and without a surround pattern. For nine of 25 cells tested, surround stimulation at the cell's optimum orientation facilitated the response to a <b>central</b> <b>grating</b> of low contrast (< or = 0. 1) but inhibited that to a higher-contrast central stimulus: the contrast-response gain is reduced but the threshold contrast is actually decreased by surround stimulation. Hence the receptive field is effectively larger for low-contrast than for high-contrast stimuli. Inhibition from the periphery is usually greatest at or around the cell's optimum, while suppression within the receptive field has been shown to be largely non-selective for orientation. Inhibition by orientations flanking the optimum could serve to sharpen orientation selectivity in the presence of contextual stimuli and to enhance orientational contrast; and it may play a part in orientation contrast illusions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe visual motion aftereffect (MAE) {{typically}} {{occurs when}} stationary contours are presented to a retinal region that {{has previously been}} exposed to motion. It can also be generated following observation of a stationary grating when two gratings (above and below it) move laterally: the surrounding gratings induce motion {{in the opposite direction}} in the central one. Following adaptation, the centre appears to move in the direction opposite to the previously induced motion, but little or no MAE is visible in the surround gratings [Swanston and Wade (1992) Perception, 21, 569 – 582]. The stimulus conditions that generate the MAE from induced motion were examined in five experiments. It was found that: the central MAE occurs when tested with stationary centre and surround gratings following adaptation to surround motion alone (Expt 1); no MAEs in either the centre or surround can be measured when the test stimulus is the centre alone or the surround alone (Expt 2); the maximum MAE in the <b>central</b> <b>grating</b> occurs when the same surround region is adapted and tested (Expt 3); the duration of the MAE is dependent upon the spatial frequency of the surround but not the centre (Expt 4); MAEs can be observed in the surround gratings when they are themselves surrounded by stationary gratings during test (Expt 5). It is concluded that the linear MAE occurs as a consequence of adapting restricted retinal regions to motion but it can only be expressed when nonadapted regions are also tested.

40|$|AbstractRecently, it {{has been}} {{proposed}} that all suppressive phenomena observed in the primary visual cortex (V 1) are mediated by a single mechanism, involving inhibition by pools of neurons, which, between them, represent {{a wide range of}} stimulus specificities. The strength of such inhibition would depend on the stimulus that produces it (particularly its contrast) rather than on the firing rate of the inhibited cell. We tested this hypothesis by measuring contrast-response functions (CRFs) of neurons in cat V 1 for stimulation of the classical receptive field of the dominant eye with an optimal grating alone, and in the presence of inhibition caused by (1) a superimposed orthogonal grating (cross-orientation inhibition); (2) a surrounding iso-oriented grating (surround inhibition); and (3) an orthogonal grating in the other eye (interocular suppression). We fitted hyperbolic ratio functions and found that the effect of cross-orientation inhibition was best described as a rightward shift of the CRF (‘contrast-gain control’), while surround inhibition and interocular suppression were primarily characterised as downward shifts of the CRF (‘response-gain control’). However, the latter also showed a component of contrast-gain control. The two modes of suppression were differently distributed between the layers of cortex. Response-gain control prevailed in layer 4, whereas cells in layers 2 / 3, 5 and 6 mainly showed contrast-gain control. As in human observers, surround gratings caused suppression when the <b>central</b> <b>grating</b> was of high contrast, but in over a third of the cells tested, enhanced responses for low-contrast central stimuli, hence actually decreasing threshold contrast...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of a visual stimulus not only increases the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activation in its retinotopic regions in the visual cortex but also suppresses the activation of the nearby regions. Here we investigated whether there are multiple components for such lateral effects by using the m-sequence paradigm to measure the stimulus spatial configuration specific BOLD activation. The central target (2 cyc/deg grating) was centered on a fixation point while the flanking stimulus was placed 2 ◦ away and was located on axes that were either collinear or orthogonal to the target’s orientation. Three types of flankers were used: gratings whose orientation {{was the same as}} the <b>central</b> stimulus, <b>gratings</b> which were orthogonal to the stimulus, and random dots. The onset and offset of each stimulus were determined by shifted copies of an 8 -bit long m-sequence. The duration of each state of the sequence was 2 s or 1 TR. The first order activation, computed as the waveform recorded following on-states minus that recorded after off-states, determined the retinotopic regions for each stimulus. We then computed BOLD activation waveforms for the target under various flanker conditions. All flankers reduced the activation to the target. The suppressive effect was largest following the {{presence of}} the iso-orientation collinear flankers. Our result suggests two types of BOLD signal suppression: general suppression, which occurs whenever a flanker is presented and is insensitive to the spatial configuration of the stimuli, and spatial configuration dependent suppression, which {{may be related to the}} collinear flanker effect...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{pathophysiology}} of migraine is incompletely understood, but evidence {{points to}} hyper-responsivity of cortical neurons being a key feature. The basis of hyper-responsiveness is not clear, with an excitability imbalance potentially arising from either reduced inhibition or increased excitation. In this study, we measure centre-surround contrast suppression in people with migraine as a perceptual analogue of the interplay between inhibition and excitation in cortical areas responsible for vision. We predicted that reduced inhibitory function in migraine would reduce perceptual surround suppression. Recent models of neuronal surround suppression incorporate excitatory feedback that drives surround inhibition. Consequently, an increase in excitation predicts an increase in perceptual surround suppression. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Twenty-six people with migraine and twenty approximately age- and gender-matched non-headache controls participated. The perceived contrast of a <b>central</b> sinusoidal <b>grating</b> patch (4 c/deg stationary grating, or 2 c/deg drifting at 2 deg/sec, 40 % contrast) was measured in the presence and absence of a 95 % contrast annular grating (same orientation, spatial frequency, and drift rate). For the static grating, similar surround suppression strength was present in control and migraine groups {{with the presence of}} the surround resulting in the central patch appearing to be 72 % and 65 % of its true contrast for control and migraine groups respectively (t(44)  =  0. 81, p =  0. 42). For the drifting stimulus, the migraine group showed significantly increased surround suppression (t(44)  =  2. 86, p< 0. 01), with perceived contrast being on average 53 % of actual contrast for the migraine group and 68 % for non-headache controls. CONCLUSIONS: In between migraines, when asymptomatic, visual surround suppression for drifting stimuli is greater in individuals with migraine than in controls. The data provides evidence for a behaviourally measurable imbalance in inhibitory and excitatory visual processes in migraine and is incompatible with a simple model of reduced cortical inhibitory function within the visual system...|$|R
40|$|Acetylcholine (ACh) {{reduces the}} spatial spread of {{excitatory}} fMRI responses in early visual cortex and the receptive field sizes of V 1 neurons. We investigated the perceptual {{consequences of these}} physiological effects of ACh with surround suppression and crowding, two tasks that involve spatial interactions between visual field locations. Surround suppression refers to the reduction in perceived stimulus contrast by a high-contrast surround stimulus. For grating stimuli, surround suppression is selective for the relative orientations of the center and surround, suggesting that it results from inhibitory interactions in early visual cortex. Crowding refers to impaired identification of a peripheral stimulus {{in the presence of}} flankers and is thought to result from excessive integration of visual features. We increased synaptic ACh levels by administering the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil to healthy human subjects in a placebo-controlled, double-blind design. In Exp. 1, we measured surround suppression of a <b>central</b> <b>grating</b> using a contrast discrimination task with three conditions: 1) surround grating with the same orientation as the center (parallel), 2) surround orthogonal to the center, or 3) no surround. Contrast discrimination thresholds were higher in the parallel than in the orthogonal condition, demonstrating orientation-specific surround suppression (OSSS). Cholinergic enhancement reduced thresholds only in the parallel condition, thereby reducing OSSS. In Exp. 2, subjects performed a crowding task in which they reported the identity of a peripheral letter flanked by letters on either side. We measured the critical spacing between the target and flanking letters that allowed reliable identification. Cholinergic enhancement had no effect on critical spacing. Our findings suggest that ACh reduces spatial interactions in tasks involving segmentation of visual field locations but that these effects may be limited to early visual cortical processing...|$|E
40|$|V 1 neurons {{have been}} {{observed}} to respond more strongly to figure than background regions. Within a figure region, the responses are usually stronger near figure boundaries (the border effect), than further inside the boundaries. Sometimes the medial axes of the figures (e. g., the vertical midline of a vertical figure strip) induce secondary, intermediate, response peaks (the medial axis effect). Related is the physiologically elusive ‘‘cross-orientation facilitation’’, the observation that a cell’s response to a grating patch can be facilitated by an orthogonally oriented grating in the surround. Higher center feedbacks have been suggested to cause these figure–ground effects. It has been shown, using a V 1 model, that the causes could be intra-cortical interactions within V 1 that serve pre-attentive visual segmentation, particularly, object boundary detection. Furthermore, whereas the border effect is robust, the figure–ground effects {{in the interior of}} a figure, in particular, the medial axis effect, are by-products of the border effect and are predicted to diminish to zero for larger figures. This model prediction (of the figure size dependence) was subsequently confirmed physiologically, and supported by findings that the response modulations by texture surround do not depend on feedbacks from V 2. In addition, the model explains the ‘‘cross-orientation facilitation’ ’ as caused by a dis-inhibition, to the cell responding {{to the center of the}} <b>central</b> <b>grating,</b> by the background grating. Furthermore, the elusiveness of this phenomena was accounted for by the insight that it depends critically on the size of the figure grating. The model is applied to understand some figure–ground effects and segmentation in psychophysics: in particular, that contrast discrimination threshold is lower within and at the center of a closed contour than that in the background, and that a very briefly presented vernier target can perceptually shine through a subsequently presented large grating centered at the same location...|$|E
40|$|Optical fibre {{gratings}} {{are being}} produced for {{an increasing number}} of applications. With the advances in grating fabrication technology, advances in grating characterisation schemes are required. A few years ago, only the reflectivity, bandwidth and <b>central</b> wavelength of <b>gratings</b> were needed. Today, applications such as dispersion compensation and distributed sensing require the distributed characteristics of a grating, namely the time delay and reflectivity as a function of wavelength. Until recently, distributed grating measurements have been made using a tunable narrowband laser source. The wavelength to be measured was selected by tuning the laser. The reflectivity was obtained from the returning optical power level and the time delay of the chosen wavelength was obtained using phase measurements. The phase measurements were either optically coherent, or optically incoherent (electrically coherent). These systems only correctly characterise gratings having monotonic wavelength profiles. Their temporal resolution is determined by the local chirp of the grating and the grating wavelength. For dispersion compensation, gratings with a linear, monotonic chirp are required and thus the laser characterisation scheme at first sight appears suitable. We recently demonstrated a novel grating characterisation system using a broadband source. Low-coherence interferometry selected the time delay to be interrogated and a tunable filter measured the local Bragg wavelength. This system has characterised gratings of arbitrary (including non-monotonic) wavelength profiles. The latest results of our low-coherence interrogation system are presented together with results from a theoretical analysis of its performance.

Observers fixated a <b>central</b> oblique test <b>grating</b> flanked by two pairs of orthogonally oriented context gratings arranged in a cross (+) configuration. Each context pair could induce the test stimulus to appear to switch from diagonal motion to either horizontal motion (due to one context pair) or vertical motion (due to the other). Spontaneous switching between these motion states was observed under free viewing. We demonstrate that observers can voluntarily select between specific states when cued to attend selectively to one or other context pair in an alternating manner. Concurrent reports of perceived test stimulus motion depended specifically on which context was currently attended, indicating {{a high degree of}} “cued-control” over subjective state via attended context. Further experiments established that the perception was nevertheless still constrained by physical stimulus context as well as by attentional selection among that context. Moreover, the attentional control evident here did not seem reducible solely to local contrast gain modulation of the attended vs. ignored context elements. Selective attention to different parts of the context can evidently resolve the ambiguity of the test grating, with integration arising selectively for those components that are jointly attended. Such selective integration can result in substantial voluntarily controlled changes in phenomenal perception...|$|R

On scales of 80 to 250 kpc there is a low temperature, high metallicity, swirl of intracluster medium as seen in other clusters. In the core we find evidence for a further three X-ray cavities, in addition to the two previously discovered. Enhancements in 1. 5 GHz radio emission are correlated with the X-ray cavities. The total 4 PV enthalpy associated with the cavities is around 5 x 10 ^ 59 erg. This energy would be enough to heat the cooling region for ~ 5 x 10 ^ 7 yr. We find a maximum pressure discontinuity of 26 per cent (2 sigma) across the surface brightness edge to the south-west of the cluster core. This corresponds to an upper limit on the Mach number of the cool core with respect to its surroundings of 0. 55. Comment: 11 pages, 16 figures, accepted by MNRA...|$|R
