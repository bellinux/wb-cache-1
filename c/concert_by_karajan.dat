5000|$|The first Whitsun Concerts {{centered}} on three symphonies by Bruckner, all conducted <b>by</b> <b>Karajan</b> and {{played at the}} Großes Festspielhaus over three days by the Berlin Philharmonic. Years later, opera {{became part of the}} activities, and [...] "Concerts" [...] became officially [...] "Festival." [...] In the 1990s there began an emphasis on works from the Baroque repertoire. In 2005, for example, the Salzburg Whitsun Festival presented Handel's Acis and Galatea and his oratorio Solomon.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s Damiani started working {{predominantly}} with other directors rather than Strehler and even started directing himself.

He designed the sets for a noted 1974 production of Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard. In 1974 both Strehler and Damiani returned to the Salzburg Festival for an ill-fated production of Die Zauberflöte conducted <b>by</b> <b>Karajan.</b>|$|R

50|$|Raimondi made disappointingly few studio recordings, {{given the}} length of his career and the sheer number of internationally {{distinguished}} opera houses where he sang. Even recorded versions of his live performances are not as frequent as they could and should have been. The most famous of his surviving recorded interpretations is probably La Traviata, opposite Renata Scotto and Ettore Bastianini. He also appeared in a film version of La bohème with Freni, and conducted <b>by</b> <b>Karajan.</b> Among his live performances, his L'amico Fritz with Freni, Rolando Panerai, and Gavazzeni on the podium (La Scala, 1963) well demonstrates the dramatic and vocal effect that he had on the stage.|$|R
