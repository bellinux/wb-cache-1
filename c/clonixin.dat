50|$|<b>Clonixin</b> is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID). It {{also has}} analgesic, antipyretic, and platelet-inhibitory actions. It is used {{primarily in the}} treatment of chronic arthritic conditions and certain soft tissue disorders associated with pain and inflammation.|$|E
50|$|The glyceryl ester of <b>clonixin,</b> clonixeril, {{is also a}} NSAID. It was {{prepared}} by a somewhat roundabout method.Clonixin was reacted with chloroacetonitrile and triethylamine to give 2. Heating with potassium carbonate and glycerol actonide displaced the activating group to produce ester 3, which was deblocked in acetic acid to produce clonixeril (4).|$|E
40|$|A reversed-phase {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic {{method that}} enables the determination of <b>clonixin</b> in human plasma and urine samples is described. Recovery of the drug was over 87. 6 and 80. 7 % for plasma and urine, respectively. The limit of quantitation of the method was established as 10 ng/ml in plasma and 20 ng/ml in urine samples, with RSDs of less than 11. 1 %. The applicability of the method was further assessed by determining the plasma concentrations time course of <b>clonixin</b> in six healthy volunteers after single oral dose administration of 150 and 300 mg of <b>clonixin</b> and Clonix...|$|E
40|$|<b>Clonixin,</b> a non-steroid analgesic, {{can be both}} reduced at {{the mercury}} {{electrode}} and oxidised at the glassy carbon electrode. The anodic response shows well-defined waves in a pH range between pH 2 - 12. The polarographic response shows two irreversible waves or peaks in the range between pH 1 - 6 shifting cathodically when pH increases. Above pH 7. 0 all the signals disappeared. The first signal in the dpp mode at pH 1. 8 was selected for analytical use. The polarographic method showed an adequate repeatability, with a CV of 0. 7 %. The detection and quantification limits were 2. 78 x 10 (- 6) M and 4. 67 x 10 (- 6) M, respectively. The dpp technique was applied successfully to both the <b>clonixin</b> uniformity content and composite assay of commercial tablets and compared with a spectrophotometric technique...|$|E
40|$|Thyroid {{disruption}} by xenobiotics {{is associated}} with a broad spectrum of severe adverse outcomes. One possible molecular target of thyroid hormone disrupting chemicals (THDCs) is transthyretin (TTR), a thyroid hormone transporter in vertebrates. To better understand the interactions between TTR and THDCs, we determined the crystallographic structures of human TTR in complex with perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and 2, 2 ', 4, 4 '-tetrahydroxybenzophenone (BP 2). The molecular interactions between the ligands and TTR were further characterized using molecular dynamics simulations. A structure-based virtual screening (VS) protocol was developed with the intention of providing an efficient tool for the discovery of novel TTR-binders from the Tox 21 inventory. Among the 192 predicted binders, 12 representatives were selected, and their TTR binding affinities were studied with isothermal titration calorimetry, of which seven compounds had binding affinities between 0. 26 and 100 mu M. To elucidate structural details in their binding to TTR, crystal structures were determined of TTR in complex with four of the identified compounds including 2, 6 -dinitro-p-cresol, bisphenol S, <b>clonixin,</b> and triclopyr. The compounds were found to bind in the TTR hormone binding sites as predicted. Our results show that the developed VS protocol is able to successfully identify potential THDCs, and we suggest that {{it can be used to}} propose THDCs for future toxicological evaluations...|$|E
40|$|Thyroid {{disruptions}} by xenobiotics {{have been}} associated with a broad spectrum of severe adverse human health effects, such as impaired brain development and metabolic syndrome. Ingestion of indoor dust and contact with industrial chemicals are two significant human exposure routes of thyroid hormone disrupting chemicals (THDCs), raising serious concerns for human health. However, it is a laborious and costly process to identify THDCs using conventional experimental methods, due to the number of chemicals in commerce and the varieties of potential disruption mechanisms. In this thesis, we are aimed at in silico identification of novel THDCs targeting transthyretin (TTR) and thyroid hormone receptor (THR) among dust contaminants and commonly used industrial chemicals. In vitro assays were used to validate the in silico prediction results. Co-crystallization and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were applied to reveal binding modes of THDCs at the studied biological targets and to explain their intermolecular recognition. The main findings presented in this thesis are: 1. Over 144 environmental pollutants have been confirmed as TTR-binders in vitro and these cover a wide range of environmental pollutants and show distinct chemical profiles including a large group of halogenated aromatic compounds and a second group of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. (Paper I) 2. In total 485 organic contaminants have been reported to be detected in household dust. The developed QSAR classification model predicted 7. 6 % of these dust contaminants and 53. 1 % of their metabolites as potential TTR-binders, which emphasizes the importance of metabolic bioactivation. After in vitro validation, four novel TTR binders with IC 50 ≤ 10 µM were identified, i. e. perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid, 2, 4, 2 ', 4 '-tetrahydroxybenzophenone (BP 2), 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridinol. (Paper II) 3. The development of a robust structure-based virtual screening (VS) protocol resulted in the prediction of 31 dust contaminants as potential binders to THRβ 1 including musk compounds, PFASs, and bisphenol A derivatives. The in vitro experiments confirmed four compounds as weak binders to THRβ 1, i. e. 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, bisphenol A (3 -chloro- 2 -hydroxypropyl) (2, 3 -dihydroxypropyl) ether, 2, 4, 2 ', 4 '-tetrahydroxybenzophenone, and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. (Paper III) 4. We revealed the binding conformations of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, perfluorooctanoic acid, and BP 2 in the thyroxine binding sites (TBSs) of TTR by co-crystallizing TTR with the three compounds. A VS protocol was developed based on the TTR complex structures that predicted 192 industrial chemicals as potential binders to TTR. Seven novel TTR binders were confirmed by in vitro experiments including <b>clonixin,</b> 2, 6 -dinitro-p-cresol (DNPC), triclopyr, fluroxypyr, bisphenol S, picloram, and mesotrione. We further co-crystallized TTR with PBS, <b>clonixin,</b> DNPC, and triclopyr, and their complex structures showed that the compounds bind in the TBSs as proposed by the VS protocol. In summary, 13 indoor dust contaminants and industrial chemicals were identified as THDCs using a combination of in silico and in vitro approaches. To the best of our knowledge, none of these compounds has previously been reported to bind to TTR or THR. The identifications of these THDCs improve our understanding on the structure-activity relationships of THDCs. The crystal structures of TTR-THDC complexes and the information on THDC-Target intermolecular interactions provide a better understanding on the mechanism-of-actions behind thyroid disruption. The dataset compiled and in silico methods developed serve as a basis for identification of more diverse THDCs in the future and a tool for guiding de novo design of safer replacements...|$|E
40|$|The prostaglandins produce {{elevation}} of intraocular pressure and {{breakdown of the}} blood-aqueous barrier. They act via the secondary messenger system, cyclic AMP. Although the pathogenesis of many forms of ocular inflammation, both external and internal, is unclear, {{it is evident that}} some forms of ocular inflammation are prostaglandin-mediated, at least in part. Others may be totally mediated by prostaglandin synthesis. At present the corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy of these conditions. However, the corticosteroids are poor inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis and have many deleterious side effects such as induction of ocular hypertension, cataract, and infection. The search for new agents that will obviate these side effects and be more specific for the disease process is crucial. The discovery that the mode of action of many nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents is via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis places a premium on elucidating which of these agents is most effective and least toxic in the eye and by which route of administration. The arachidonic acid screening model is ideal for initially choosing which agent has the greatest potential clinically. Arachidonic acid, a PGE 2 precursor, when given topically also elevates intraocular pressure and aqueous humor protein, and these effects are blocked by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This occurs if the arachidonic acid is injected into the vitreous humor, too, providing evidence that this in vivo model involves intraocular mechanisms. Utilizing the arachidonic acid system, a comparative study of nonsteroidal inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis shows that the most effective of 14 agents were flurbiprofen solution and suspensions of polysorbate-dispersed indoxole, meclofenamic acid, indomethacin, and <b>clonixin.</b> Animal uveitis is not an ideal model for the human condition. Nevertheless, proving the superior efficacy of a screened drug in this system will identify those drugs to be tested in the human disease states. Only after the very few best drugs of this nature are identified should the ultimate steps of human testing be initiated...|$|E
