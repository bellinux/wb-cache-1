5|$|Another {{problem with}} the NIF lasers is that the flashtubes create a {{significant}} amount of heat, which warms the laser glass enough to cause it to deform. This requires a lengthy cooling-off period between shots, on the order of 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than one shot per day. To be useful as a power plant, about a dozen shots would have to take place every second, well beyond the <b>capabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NIF lasers.|$|E
5|$|As of April 1996, {{the option}} to order the seventh and eighth {{submarines}} was still under consideration, but was looked on unfavourably by the Department of Defence at the time, as the additional cost would require the diversion of funding from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, resulting in an imbalance in the <b>capabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian Defence Force. The option was cancelled outright by late 2001.|$|E

5|$|Having taken heavy {{casualties}} and losing strategic superiority, Burbridge {{and his men}} conducted a disorganized withdrawal. The Confederates had succeeded in holding the rail breastworks, yet had expended most of their ammunition in doing so. Each Confederate infantryman had fired at least seventy-five rounds, with some firing significantly more. The Union commanders then ordered another charge with a cavalry regiment that reinforced the Union infantry. The unexpected fighting <b>capabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small Confederate force had temporarily created a reprieve for the salt works.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 the Mirage IIIS fleet, nearing 20 {{years of}} {{operational}} service, began a major upgrade program {{to improve the}} <b>capabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft. The interceptors were retro-fitted with canards manufactured by Israeli Aircraft Industries on the air intakes to improve maneuverability and stability at landing speeds, new avionics and countermeasures, and redesignated the Mirage IIIS C.70.|$|E

5|$|The Magdeburg class {{introduced}} several {{significant improvements}} over earlier designs, including {{a more effective}} bow shape that improved seakeeping and a cut-down quarterdeck that allowed for more efficient handling of the ships' mines. Perhaps most importantly, a waterline armored belt was added to improve the defensive <b>capabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new ships. They also had much more powerful turbines, and as a result, a higher top speed. All following light cruisers adopted these innovations.|$|E

5|$|The {{project that}} {{eventually}} led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s as a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK), aimed at addressing the operational inadequacies of the first-generation Harrier. Early efforts centered on a larger, more powerful Pegasus engine to dramatically improve the <b>capabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Harrier. Due to budgetary constraints, the UK abandoned the project in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The {{second major}} {{instrument}} was the MKF-6M multispectral camera, which carried out Earth-resources observations. An improved {{form of a}} camera first tested on Soyuz 22, the camera captured an area of 165220kilometres with each image, down to a resolution of 20metres. Each image was captured simultaneously in six bands in 1200-frame cassettes, which required regular replacement due to the fogging effects of radiation. Salyut 6 also featured a KATE-140 stereoscopic topographic mapping camera with a focal length of 140millimetres, which captured images of 450450kilometres with a resolution of 50metres in the visible and infrared spectra, which could be operated either remotely or by the resident crews. The photographic <b>capabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station were, therefore, extensive, and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture had planted a number of specifically selected crops at test sites to examine the <b>capabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cameras.|$|E
