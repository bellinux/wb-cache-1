40|$|A cyclone {{combustor}} {{was designed}} to enable the use of dual fuels in small gas turbines. Multiple tangential inlets enable gasified products of biomass and gas oil to be introduced separately into the combustion chamber. An integrated vortex <b>collector</b> <b>pocket</b> (VCP) was positioned just before a tangential off take. As the flow moves past the VCP the fine particles are removed from the flow. The tangential off take will draw the flow past the VCP and produce near uniform exit conditions. Results showed the combustor produced a stable swirling flame, with good mixing patterns for all cases, with LCV wood gas, gas oil and when running {{with a combination of}} both fuels. Areas of high temperature in the combustor were identified, where refractory material would be needed. The VCP performance was good, collecting particles below 10 - 5 m. The tangential off-take from the combustor potentially decreases the pressure drop across the system by efficiently funnelling the swirling flow into a square duct with low losses whilst pro ducing a near uniform velocity profile. Although not used in these first trials the addition of an outlet diffuser then offers potential of reducing the pressure drop by some 30 to 40...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the performance of}} a novel design of combustor for utilising variable calorific value fuel gases as produced by many biomass gasification processes. An integral ash removal system is incorporated into the combustor to reduce the need for subsequent hot gas or other cleanup systems. The combustor is of cyclonic design with tangential inlets for air, start-up fuel and gasification products. Flame stability for low calorific value gases can be enhanced via the use of ceramic/refractory lined sections if required, with the system operating under lean combustion at all times to minimise NOx. Pressure drop of the cyclonic system is minimised by the use of a tangential outlet, as are combustion instabilities, as large central recirculation zones are avoided and associated instabilities like the precessing vortex core. Ash removal from the system is important to minimise damage to turbine components. Two regions are used for particle removal. The first is the base of the unit of a conventional hopper design, and the other, a unique vortex <b>collector</b> <b>pocket</b> (VCP) carefully positioned by the tangential off-take {{to take advantage of the}} accelerating tangential flow into the off-take. This paper focuses on the use of CFD to optimise the combustion performance of the combustor run under different operating conditions as well as the removal of coarse and fine material from the flow...|$|E

40|$|The {{isothermal}} aerodynamic {{characteristics of}} a novel inverted gasifier are described via the use of LDA and Fluent predictions. The inverted gasifier allows material such as coarse sawdust to be gasified by centrifugal suspension, giving sufficient residence time for good fuel burnout and char conversion. The addition of an external Vortex <b>Collector</b> <b>Pocket</b> (VCP) {{on the top of}} the device allows significant quantities of ash to be collected here as well as in a drop out pot at the base of the unit (which also incorporates a VCP), thus giving a reasonably clean gas that can be used to directly fired small gas turbines. Only one inlet is used on the system as this enables the fuel and gasifying air to be simply premixed upstream of the inlet. The use of only one inlet has been found not to seriously affect the system performance. This study was directed at investigating the isothermal properties of the unit both to optimize the swirl number and maximize the centrifugal force field used to suspend the gasifying particles as well as maximizing the amount of material collected by both sets of collector pockets. LDA was used to experimentally characterize a full size model of the system with access being provided via quartz windows. Three different swirl numbers were covered as well as a range of flow rates and Reynolds Numbers. These results showed that there was an optimal level of swirl number whereby the inlet flow most effectively coupled with the flow in the cyclone chamber an...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} arising {{from the use of}} gasified products from biomass in small gas turbines is the development of stable secondary combustors which can efficiently utilise the variable quality medium to low calorific value gases so produced whilst still be capable of efficiently utilising fuels such as heating oil or natural gas for start-up/shutdown operations or as a pilot fuel during certain operational periods. A further requirement in direct-fired gas turbine applications is the removal of as many particles as possible down to 5 microns or less to minimise damage to the turbine. A cyclone type combustor was designed for such a process and will run on multiple fuels, primarily oil and low to medium CV wood gas. The combustor was designed with three tangential inlets, an oil inlet, a wood gas inlet and an air inlet. CFD modelling of the combustor was performed using the package Fluent. The model was initially run on LCV gas. The flow characteristics and temperature patterns in the combustor were investigated and the behaviour of the fuels combustion patterns studied. The LCV gas entering the combustor contained particles of varying size. The combustor was designed with a conical bottom section to collect the large particles, however finer particles are still carried with the flow to the combustor exit. The exhaust gas from the combustor must contain particles with a diameter below 5 microns, otherwise damage to the turbine would occur. The combustor was designed with a vortex <b>collector</b> <b>pocket</b> (VCP) positioned just before the tangential off take to collect the finer particles before they exit the combustor. Results showed the combustor produced a stable swirling flame, with good mixing patterns for the LCV gas. Areas of high temperature in the combustor were identified, where refractory material would be needed. The VCP performance was good, collecting most particles below 5 microns...|$|E

6000|$|December 8.--Talking of the vixisse, {{it may not}} be impertinent {{to notice}} that Knox, a young poet of {{considerable}} talent, died here a week or two since. His father was a respectable yeoman, and he himself, succeeding to good farms under the Duke of Buccleuch, became too soon his own master, and plunged into dissipation and ruin. His poetical talent, a very fine one, then showed itself in a fine strain of pensive poetry, called, I think, The Lonely Hearth, far superior to those of Michael Bruce, whose consumption, by the way, has been the life of his verses. But poetry, nay, good poetry, is a drug in the present day. I am a wretched patron. I cannot go with a subscription-paper, like a pocket-pistol about me, and draw unawares on some honest country-gentleman, who has as much alarm as if I had used the phrase [...] "stand and deliver," [...] and parts with his money with a grimace, indicating some suspicion that the crown-piece thus levied goes ultimately into the <b>collector's</b> own <b>pocket.</b> This I see daily done; and I have seen such collectors, when they have exhausted Papa and Mamma, continue their trade among the misses, and conjure out of their pockets those little funds which should carry them to a play or an assembly. It is well people will go through this--it does some good, I suppose, and they have great merit who can sacrifice their pride so far as to attempt it in this way. For my part I am a bad promoter of subscriptions; but I wished to do what I could for this lad, whose talent I really admired; and I am not addicted to admire heaven-born poets, or poetry that is reckoned very good considering. I had him, Knox,[60] at Abbotsford, about ten years ago, but found him unfit for that sort of society. I tried to help him, but there were temptations he could never resist. He scrambled on, writing for the booksellers and magazines, and living like the Otways, and Savages, and Chattertons of former days, though I do not know that he was in actual want. His connection with me terminated in begging a subscription or a guinea now and then. His last works were spiritual hymns, and which he wrote very well. In his own line of society he was said to exhibit infinite humour; but all his works are grave and pensive, a style perhaps, like Master Stephen's melancholy,[61] affected for the nonce.|$|R
