In 1952 Commander William Slayter also did many changes to the house.

5000|$|Truss uplift or truss lift is {{when the}} wood in wooden trusses shrinks, or cures, and the bottom most piece bows upwards, most notably near the middle. Truss lift is an issue in wood frame {{construction}} where non-load bearing drywall walls meet drywall ceilings, as the truss lifts it pulls the ceiling drywall up. This in turn pulls the angle tape {{out of the corner}} and can damage the spray texture. One solution is to not fasten the ceiling drywall within two feet of a non load bearing wall, and rather use the drywall on the wall as support. This technique will allow the <b>ceiling</b> <b>board</b> to bow down and stay tight to the angle over time as the truss lifts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{developers}} saw fit {{to retain}} a similar concept of the [...] "Worlds" [...] and introduce it to the new development. Different themes like African, Spanish, Egyptians and Wild West were implemented inside the toilets accompanied with ornamentations all around the mall. Even the <b>ceiling</b> <b>board</b> is painted sky blue to portray the idea of visitors entering into a [...] "World" [...] of its own. The thematic approach was met with {{both sides of the}} critic, with the younger generation lauding the convenience brought by the mall while the older generation lamenting the lack of justice that these thematic facades do to the rich history that Great World Amusement Park brings. Only a slight resemblance could be made in the facade leading to the entrance of the shopping centre.|$|E
50|$|The Mara Wetland {{like other}} {{wetlands}} {{is an important}} source of natural resources and habitat to a variety of fauna and flora. A number of plant species are found the major ones being Cyperus papyrus (Matende/Matete) and Typha domingensis (Mabilimbili). The livelihood of the communities living around the wetland depends on various services provided by the wetland. The main social economic activities of the communities around the Mara Wetland are fishing and papyrus harvesting Over 80% of the population in communities adjacent to the wetland make their daily living from fishing activities. Although papyrus harvesting is among the major social economic activities of the community around the Mara Wetland only 5% of the papyrus is harvested per year. Papyrus is normally used in making of different household commodities such as mats, baskets, placards, <b>ceiling</b> <b>board,</b> vegetable containers, lamp shades, pads and arm chairs.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} work investigates the potential applicability of waste {{paper in the}} production of <b>ceiling</b> <b>boards</b> with focus on achieving: environmental sustainability, safe disposal of waste paper and more cost effective production of materials. The main view was to provide an alternative to the conventional asbestos <b>ceiling</b> <b>boards</b> that are costly and also pose health risks. Three mix designs were formulated and used for the casting (1 : 1, 1 : 1. 5 and 1 : 2), varying in regards of the weight of the waste paper components. CaCO 3 was added to the mix as an additive as well as starch bond glue to aid binding. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the properties and suitability of the produced boards. Properties such as water absorption, abrasion, compressive strength, flexural strength and ultimate loads were considered for comparison. The boards with 1 : 1 mix ratio displayed the best results of the test properties hence, its mechanized manufacturing was recommended...|$|R

First, {{with regard to the}} long-duration ground motion, the damage of a base-isolation building is described. The damage to the 8 – 9 -story buildings in the Aobayama campus of Tohoku University, in a hilly zone, is also described in relation to site-specific ground motion amplification. As specific building damage, pile foundation damage is described. The <b>ceiling</b> <b>board</b> drop damage is also presented as an example of non-structural element damage.

40|$|The {{serviceability}} and comfortability of {{a building}} edifice are functions of its facilities and materials of construction. The level of facilities and quality of materials determine the degree of comfort, satisfaction and comfortability the users of residential buildings will enjoy. The study assessed the level of facilities and materials specification of residential buildings in Nigeria. Data were collected through questionnaire administered on the users of residential buildings in the study area. The study {{found out that the}} facilities available in most of the residential buildings are water closet and ceiling fan. Moreover, materials mostly used in construction were asbestos <b>ceiling</b> <b>board,</b> emulsion paint, floor screed among others. The study concluded that residential buildings in the study area were built with the basic facilities and materials for construction. The study therefore recommends the need for both the government and private players in housing to formulate policy to enforce a minimum standard of facilities and materials specification in residential buildings as essential need of man. This will eliminate the possibility of environmental challenges such as water and household-waste pollutions which could arise from non-availability of basic facilities and thereby improve the living conditions of the users...|$|E

40|$|The rate of heat {{transfer}} to a specimen in The Fire Propagation Test has been measured. It rises as the test proceeds through a range corresponding roughly {{to that in the}} Spread of Flame Test (B. S. 476) and after about five minutes this rate of {{heat transfer}} becomes greater than that at the position of maximum spread for Class I material in the Spread of Flame Test. This presumably is one reason why The Fire Propagation Test distingui. shes between low spread materials better than does the classification in the Spread of Flame Test. The ratesof heat transfer in both tests are much higher than that necessary for the pilot ignition of untreated cellulosic materials but they may not be sufficient for the pilot ignition of some treated ones. They are, also, less than the heat transfer rate recorded over an ' experimental fire in a model corridor. The calculated initial rate of spread of fire along a wooden floor in this model when lined with a ceiling of cellulosic building board is well correlated with the fire propagation index of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>board.</b> Further work is in progress to assess whether the test is sufficiently sensitive for a wider range of materials.
