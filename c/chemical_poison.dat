40|$|SummaryStreptozotocin is {{a natural}} product that {{selectively}} kills insulin-secreting β cells, and is widely used to generate mouse models of diabetes or treat pancreatic tumors. Several studies suggest that streptozotocin toxicity stems from its N-nitrosourea moiety releasing nitric oxide and possessing DNA alkylating activity. However, {{it has also been}} proposed that streptozotocin induces apoptosis by inhibiting O-GlcNAcase, an enzyme that, together with O-GlcNAc transferase, is important for dynamic intracellular protein O-glycosylation. We have used galacto-streptozotocin to chemically dissect the link between O-GlcNAcase inhibition and apoptosis. Using X-ray crystallography, enzymology, and cell biological studies on an insulinoma cell line, we show that, whereas streptozotocin competitively inhibits O-GlcNAcase and induces apoptosis, its galacto-configured derivative no longer inhibits O-GlcNAcase, yet still induces apoptosis. This supports a general <b>chemical</b> <b>poison</b> mode of action for streptozotocin, suggesting the need for using more specific inhibitors to study protein O-GlcNAcylation...|$|E
40|$|This work {{attempts}} to gain fundamental {{information about the}} role of Fe in the chemical deactivation of a three-way catalyst (TWC), with Fe originating from materials used in the construction of automotive engines and exhaust pipe systems. Topics of particular interest are Fe’s role as a <b>chemical</b> <b>poison</b> of the oxygen storage and release properties of a model TWC (1 wt % Pd–Rh/ 20 wt % CeO 2 –Al 2 O 3), its effects on the redox properties of Pd and Rh, and its effects on NO and CO chemisorption; these topics are investigated for the first time here. Oxygen storage capacity (OSC) measurements in the 500 – 850 ◦C range indicated that OSC increased after the addition of 0. 1 – 0. 3 wt % Fe in the model catalyst. It can be concluded that iron acted as an oxygen storage component under oxidizing conditions through the process Fe → FeO → Fe 3 O 4 (FeO·Fe 2 O 3) → Fe 2 O 3, and not as a <b>chemical</b> <b>poison</b> of the oxygen storage and release properties of the solid. However, when the amount of deposited iron increased to 0. 4 wt%, the OSC of the catalyst deteriorated but still remained slightly greater than that measured over the catalyst uncontaminated with Fe catalyst. H 2 temperature-programmed desorption and reduction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies performed on the oxidized and reduced Fe-contaminated samples indicated that iron (0. 1 – 0. 3 wt%) was deposited on both noble metals (Pd and Rh) and support, causing the development of electronic interactions that influenced the oxidation states of Pd and Rh and enhanced the oxygen chemisorption properties of ceria. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) studies proved that iron deposited to a level of 0. 2 wt % significantly favors the formation of a superoxide (O 2 −) species on CeO 2. The latter species was found to desorb completely at temperatures above 250 ◦C. However, at the 0. 4 wt % level, O 2 − formation was minor. In situ DRIFTS chemisorption studies of CO and N...|$|E

40|$|Parenteral {{introduction}} of {{amounts of the}} culture filtrate of Bacillus botulinus greatly {{in excess of the}} minimum lethal dose has been observed to cause the practically immediate death of mice. This result is due to the presence in the filtrates of a <b>chemical</b> <b>poison</b> possessing properties distinct from those of the contained botulinus toxin which itself acts only after a well defined period of incubation. This <b>chemical</b> <b>poison</b> is not neutralized by botulinus antitoxin; it is effective only when large amounts of the culture filtrate are given; it is thermostable, not being destroyed when heated in the autoclave in a sealed tube, though when it is heated in an open container its toxicity diminishes with a coincidental volatilization of basic material. The volatile substance can be identified as ammonia. Death resulting from the injection of comparatively large amounts of ammonium salts (0. 1 gm.) is easily distinguished from that due to botulism, both through the character of the symptoms and the absence of an incubation period. However, when the amount of toxic salts injected is smaller (0. 01 gm.), the symptoms of poisoning are not so characteristic and death may be delayed long enough to suggest a period of incubation similar to that observed in botulism (Table IV). This circumstance is of importance in connection with the examination of partly decomposed food products in which the presence of botulinus toxin is suspected. As a rule such suspected material is injected in massive doses (0. 5 to 1 cc.) in mice. It is conceivable that such spoiled foods may be contaminated with common putrefactive bacteria yielding ammonia during their growth and thus may cause death of the test animals. If in such tests mice passively protected by the preliminary injection of an excess of antitoxin be used in addition to normal animals, the chances of an error in the interpretation of the results will be materially reduced, though not ruled out. Unfortunately for such a procedure, botulinus antitoxin is not readily available, while furthermore, recent findings indicate that it may not always be effective owing to the existence of a group of toxin-producing bacteria very similar to Bacillus botulinus, but not homologous immunologically with either of the known types of the latter. The test of thermostability of the toxic constituents of suspected food may conceivably help to determine {{the true nature of the}} poison...|$|E
40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that suscepti-bility to insulin dependent diabetes (IDD) is an inherited characteristic, {{but it is}} clear from studies of diabetes in identical twins that environmental factors also have an important role in its patho-genesis (1). The essential lesion in IDD appears to be specific damage to the insulin producing B-cells of the islets of Langerhans (2), and there is extensive evidence that this damage can be initi-ated in animals by a number of different virus infections (reviewed in references 3 and 4). It has long been suspected that this may also be the case in human dia-betes, but evidence has been almost wholly circumstantial. Recently, however, direct evidence has been reported of the causal role of Coxsackie B 4 virus in the devel-opment of diabetes in a child in the United States (5), but it is not known how frequently diabetes arises in this way.

Within the first 24 hours of the disease, the children were found to have higher neutrophils, lower lymphocytes, and moderate monocytosis.
