5|$|By 1956, {{the surface}} of RM 2134 had been {{upgraded}} to stone, and the northern portion had been additionally straightened. On December 1, 1957, FM 2134 was extended northeastward across the Colorado River to the community of Voss. By 1961, the portion designated as RM 2134 had been upgraded to a bituminous surface, made of asphalt and <b>crushed</b> <b>rock.</b> The other road segment had been upgraded to a metal surface. In addition, a new bridge had been constructed along the RM 2134 portion, {{and it had been}} straightened generally along the present location of RE11. In 1985, plans were approved for the construction of the Stacey Reservoir. The construction was finished in 1990, and the lake was instead named the O.H. Ivie Reservoir. The construction of the lake destroyed a large portion of RM 2134, and caused the removal of the highway to FM 1929. RE11 was designated on its current location on October 31, 1996, and was officially approved on December 20, 1996. The route remains the most recently designated recreational road.|$|E

25|$|For {{the most}} part {{advances}} in crusher design have moved slowly. Jaw crushers have remained virtually unchanged for sixty years. More reliability and higher production {{have been added to}} basic cone crusher designs that have also remained largely unchanged. Increases in rotating speed have provided the largest variation. For instance, a 48-inch (120cm) cone crusher manufactured in 1960 may be able to produce 170 tons/h of <b>crushed</b> <b>rock,</b> whereas the same size crusher manufactured today may produce 300 tons/h. These production improvements come from speed increases and better crushing chamber designs.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of refined asphalt is used in construction: primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications. According {{to the requirements of}} the end use, asphalt is produced to specification. This is achieved either by refining or blending. It is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately 102 million tonnes per year. Approximately 85% of all the asphalt produced is used as the binder in asphalt concrete for roads. It is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways, car parks and footways. Typically, the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse aggregates such as sand, gravel and <b>crushed</b> <b>rock</b> with asphalt, which acts as the binding agent. Other materials, such as recycled polymers (e.g., rubber tyres), may be added to the asphalt to modify its properties according to the application for which the asphalt is ultimately intended.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{his most}} famous {{creation}} was the Ruwanweliseya, {{also known as the}} Great Stupa or and Swarnamalee Chetiya, to house the begging bowl of the Buddha. The construction was started on the full moon day of the month of Vesak (traditionally the date of the birth, enlightenment, and passing away of the Buddha) with the creation of a foundation of <b>crushed</b> <b>rock.</b> To hammer the stones into place elephants were used with their feet bound in leather. Dutugemunu is said to have overseen the work personally, being present at the construction of the relic chamber and the interring of the bowl itself. The dedication of a stupa is described in Chap. 29 of the Mahavamsa, which lists the visit of delegations from various parts of India, as well as a delegation of 30,000 monks from Alexandria of the Caucasus, led by the Indo-Greek monk Mahadharmaraksita.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} {{was also}} involved {{in the construction of}} the 1st Australian Logistics Support Group (1 ALSG) base amid the sand dunes at Vung Tau following its occupation in May 1966. Although a detachment of engineers from 1 RAR Group had commenced basic works to prepare the area prior to the lodgement, including a basic water supply and road construction, much work remained. Lacking basic facilities for logistic operations including unloading facilities, roads and hardstanding, 1 ALSG struggled to become operational and commence logistic support to 1 ATF forward at Nui Dat. Meanwhile, basic hygiene and stifling heat were also a significant problem. Urgent work was required and the development plan included cutting and spreading the sand dunes, reclaiming large areas of swamp land, road construction, establishing accommodation, hardstanding, storage areas, workshops and vehicles parks, as well as extensive drainage works. Other tasks included winning construction resources, water purification and supply, electricity generation, survey, bridging and rafting, and civil aid. Helipads were also constructed to enable 1 ALSG to be resupplied by helicopter and for 2 Field Ambulance to receive casualties. Later, in April 1968 a quarry was also constructed at Vung Tau to supply <b>crushed</b> <b>rock,</b> gravel and fine sand for the pavement of roads, airfields, helipads and development of hardstanding.|$|E

40|$|Moisture ingress is {{a primary}} {{catalyst}} for pavement damage and {{plays a key role}} in the performance of pavement materials in service. This is evident from the issues faced as a result of high moisture sensitivity of <b>crushed</b> <b>rocks</b> used in the construction of Kwinana Freeway in Western Australia. Cement treatment is deemed a potential solution to reduce moisture sensitivity. The moisture ingress into cement treated <b>crushed</b> <b>rocks</b> can be based on the unsaturated flow theory and quantified with the term Sorpitivity, S, i. e. the square root rate of inflow volume. The linearity of the Sorptivity when plotting inflow volume against the square root of time, t 0. 5 also provides an indication of the homogeneity of the material. This paper assessed the Sorptivity of cement treated <b>crushed</b> <b>rocks</b> based on results from the Tube Suction Test procedures developed by Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The tests shows that Sorpitivity decreases with the increase in cement content which means that higher cement content reduces the moisture sensitivity of pavements. The Sorpitivity also showed a high least-square regression of R 2 > 0. 9, which indicates that the materials are homogeneous...|$|R

The runway had been sealed with an excess of bitumen, which became soft in the heat, and parked aircraft tended to sink into it.
