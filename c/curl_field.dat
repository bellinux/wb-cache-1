The divergence field has substantially longer coherence time and more power than does the <b>curl</b> <b>field.</b> Statistically, curl is better correlated with regions of negative divergence - that is, the vertical vorticity is higher in downflow regions, suggesting excess vorticity in intergranular lanes. The average value of the divergence is largest (i. e., outflow is largest) where the horizontal speed is large; we associate these regions with exploding granules.

30|$|We {{speculate}} on {{the cause of the}} negative lag estimated at the low frequencies (< ∼ 1 day− 1). The negative lag is not expected to originate from the thermal response of the sensor with a finite delay time. At low frequencies, the effects of the thermal response may be relatively negligible compared to substantial oceanic signals. Niiler et al. (1993) remarked that barotropic OBP variations due to water convergence/divergence, with periods of days, are mainly induced by synoptic wind-stress curl fields. For example, water convergence related to a negative wind-stress <b>curl</b> <b>field</b> induces sea-level elevation. This water convergence results in an increase of OBP and a downward movement of water that may contribute to an increase of the bottom temperature, since the temperature of the upper layer is usually warmer than that of the bottom water. This succession could account for the negative lags, i.e. the increase (decrease) of OBP leading the increase (decrease) of the bottom temperature.|$|E

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{variability of}} the wind stress curl over the North Atlantic is investigated by means of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis.

Physically, the first EOF is seen as the seasonal fluctuations of the mean wind stress curl pattern.

40|$|The {{effects of}} sharply {{different}} wind forcing {{patterns on the}} upwelling system and upwelling source waters over the California Current System (CCS) are investigated using adjoint-based sensitivity analyses in the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). The wind stress <b>curl</b> <b>field</b> appears to control {{the locations of the}} equatorward flow and cross -shore gradient of isopycnal. A deeper upwelling cell and more remote source waters for the upwelling are found when the wind stress <b>curl</b> <b>field</b> changes sharply cross-shore. In contrast, a gradual change of wind stress curl causes a shallower upwelling and local source waters for the upwelling. Data assimilation (DA) combines numerical models and data to determine the best possible estimate of the state of a dynamic system. Data-assimilated ocean states are prepared using the ROMS four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4 D-VAR) system with satellite and in situ data during four separate upwelling seasons. They are used for the diagnosis of observed phenomena such as an abrupt change in the Pacific sardine egg distributions. The ROMS 4 D-VAR system adjusts the initial conditions and surface forcing for one-month time periods and successfully reduced the statistical differences from the observations. Analysis using optimally estimated ocean states shows stronger offshore transport during the April 2002 La Niña conditions than during the weak 2003 El Niño. This partially causes the extension of preferred spawning habitat for the Pacific sardine but distributes eggs over a broad area, resulting in the lower sampled egg concentration. The adjoint model runs with passive tracer reveal that the nutrient richness of the source waters also contributes to the sardine egg distributions. This dissertation also suggests two new data assimilation approaches to improve the ensemble representativeness of the true states in the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). These two approaches, an adaptive EnKF (AEnKF) and a four-dimensional AEnKF (4 D-AEnKF), estimate the ensemble statistics better by including new members in the ensemble. The AEnKF creates new members at the current analysis time step, and the 4 D-AEnKF creates new members in the past analysis time step, with the aid of the adjoint model to enrich the ensemble.

We present results from two experi-ments in which monkey or human subjects learned to make two-dimensional reaching movements while holding a robotic manipulandum that applied a predictable pattern of forces (a <b>curl</b> <b>field)</b> to their hand. In the first study, we analyzed electrophysiological data recorded in motor cortex while monkeys adapted or readapted to the novel forces on {{each day of the}} experiment. In the second study, we perturbed the excitability of motor cortex using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as human participants adapted to the forces. From the first experiment, we present qualitative evidence that a network of cortical areas including the supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, and primary motor cortex (M 1) not only encodes kinematic and dynamic parameters of motor execution, but also registers changes in encoding that could provide a substrate for motor memory. Based on the second experiment, we qualify the role ofM 1 inmotor memory, by showing that its disruption by rTMS does not interfere with the process of initial motor adaptation, but rather with offline improvement as measured at retest on the following day...|$|E
40|$|Sliding effects {{often occur}} along tissue/organ boundaries. For instance, {{it is widely}} {{observed}} that the lung and diaphragm slide against the rib cage and the atria during breathing. Conventional homogeneous smooth registration methods fail to address this issue. Some recent studies preserve motion discontinuities by either using joint registration/segmentation or utilizing robust regularization energy on the motion field. However, allowing all types of discontinuities is not strict enough for physical deformations. In particular, flows that generate local vacuums or mass collisions should be discouraged by the energy functional. In this study, we propose a regularization energy that encodes a discriminative treatment {{of different types of}} motion discontinuities. The key idea is motivated by the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, and regards the underlying motion flow as a superposition of a solenoidal component, an irrotational component and a harmonic part. The proposed method applies a homogeneous penalty on the divergence, discouraging local volume change caused by the irrotational component, thus avoiding local vacuum or collision; it regularizes the <b>curl</b> <b>field</b> with a robust functional so that the resulting solenoidal component vanishes almost everywhere except on a singular set where the large shear values are preserved. This singularity set corresponds to sliding interfaces. Preliminary tests with both simulated and clinical data showed promising results...|$|E
40|$|Being the {{extension}} of a wind-driven western boundary current, the Kuroshio Extension (KE) has long been recognized as a turbulent current system rich in large-amplitude meanders and energetic pinched-off eddies. An important feature emerging from recent satellite altimeter measurements and eddy-resolving ocean model simulations is that the KE system exhibits well-defined decadal modulations between a stable and an unstable dynamic state. Here the authors show that the decadallymodulatingKE dynamic state can be effectively defined by the sea surface height (SSH) anomalies in the 318 – 368 N, 1408 – 1658 E region. By utilizing the SSH-based KE index from 1977 to 2012, they demonstrate that the time-varying KE dynamic state can be predicted at lead times of up to; 6 yr. This long-term predictability rests on two dynamic processes: 1) the oceanic adjustment is via baroclinicRossbywaves that carry interior wind-forced anomalies westward into the KE region and 2) the low-frequency KE variability influences the extratropical storm tracks and surface wind stress <b>curl</b> <b>field</b> across the North Pacific basin. By shifting poleward (equatorward) the storm tracks and the large-scale wind stress curl pattern during its stable (unstable) dynamic state, the KE variability induces a delayed negative feedback that can enhance the predictable SSH variance on the decadal time scales. 1...|$|E

However, it is unclear to what extent sensorimotor representations obtained through experience with one limb are available to the opposite, untrained limb, and in which form they are available. Here we compared cross-limb transfer of force-field compensation after participants adapted to a velocity-dependent <b>curl</b> <b>field</b> oriented either in the sagittal or the transverse plane. Due to the mirror symmetry of the limbs, the force field had identical effects for both limbs in joint and extrinsic coordinates in the sagittal plane, but conflicting joint-based effects in the transverse plane. The degree of force-field compensation exhibited by the opposite arm in probe trials immediately after initial learning was significantly greater after sagittal (26 ± 5 %) than transverse plane adaptation (9 ± 4 %; p < 0. 001), irrespective of whether participants learned initially with the left or the right arm, or via abrupt or gradual exposure to the force field. Thus, transfer was impaired when the orientation of imposed dynamics conflicted in intrinsic coordinates for the two limbs. The data reveal that neural representations of novel dynamics are only partially available to the opposite limb, since transfer is incomplete even when force field perturbation is spatially compatible for the two limbs according to both intrinsic and extrinsic coordinate...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that sensory contextual cues can reduce the {{interference}} observed during learning of opposing force fields. However, because each study examined a small set of cues, often in a unique paradigm, the relative efficacy of different sensory contextual cues is unclear. In the present study we quantify how seven contextual cues, some investigated previously and some novel, affect the formation and recall of motor memories. Subjects made movements in a velocity-dependent <b>curl</b> <b>field,</b> with direction varying randomly from trial to trial but always associated with a unique contextual cue. Linking field direction to the cursor or background color, or to peripheral visual motion cues, did not reduce interference. In contrast, the orientation of a visual object attached to the hand cursor significantly reduced interference, albeit by a small amount. When the fields were associated with movement in different locations in the workspace, a substantial reduction in interference was observed. We tested whether this reduction in interference was due to the different locations of the visual feedback (targets and cursor) or the movements (proprioceptive). When the fields were associated only with changes in visual display location (movements always made centrally) or only with changes in the movement location (visual feedback always displayed centrally), a substantial reduction in interference was observed. These results show that although some visual cues can lead to the formation and recall of distinct representations in motor memory, changes in spatial visual and proprioceptive states of the movement are far more effective than changes in simple visual contextual cues...|$|E
40|$|Ourability to skillfullymanipulate anobject often {{involves}} themotor system learning {{to compensate for}} thedynamics of theobject. When the two arms learn tomanipulate a single object they can act cooperatively, whereas when theymanipulate separate objects they control each object independently. We examined how learning transfers between these two bimanual contexts by applying force fields to the arms. In a coupled context, a single dynamic is shared between the arms, and in anuncoupled context separate dynamics are experienced independently by each arm. In a composition experiment, we found that when subjects had learned uncoupled force fields theywere able to transfer to a coupled field that was {{the sum of the}} two fields. However, the contribution of each arm repartitioned over time so that, when they returned to the uncoupled fields, the error initially increased but rapidly reverted to the previous level. In a decomposition experiment, after subjects learned a coupled field, their error increased when exposed to uncoupled fields that were orthogonal compo-nents of the coupled field. However, when the coupled field was reintroduced, subjects rapidly readapted. These results suggest that the representations of dynamics for uncoupled and coupled contexts are partially independent. We found additional support for this hypothesis by showing significant learning of opposing curl fields when the context, coupled versus uncoupled, was alternated with the <b>curl</b> <b>field</b> direction. These results suggest that the motor system is able to use partially separate representations for dynamics of the two arms acting on a single object and two arms acting on separate objects.

We present the results of an experiment in which 17 subjects were asked to make reaching movements while grasping a joystick and wearing a pair of cutaneous devices. Each device was able to provide cutaneous contact forces through a moving platform. The subjects received visual feedback about joystick’s position.

Results indicate that kinesthetic stimuli played a primary role during motor adaptation to the viscous field, which is a fundamental premise to motor learning and rehabilitation. On the other hand, cutaneous stimulation alone appeared not to bring significant direct or adaptation effects, although it helped in reducing direct effects when used in addition to kinesthetic stimulation. The experimental conditions with visual cancellation of position error showed slower adaptation rates, indicating that visual feedback actively contributes to the formation of internal models.

40|$|Satellite {{observations}} of wind stress and sea surface temperature (SST) are analyzed to investigate ocean–atmosphere interaction in the California Current System (CCS). As in regions of strong SST fronts {{elsewhere in the}} World Ocean, SST in the CCS region is positively correlated with surface wind stress when SST fronts are strong, which occurs during the summertime in the CCS region. This ocean influence on the atmosphere is apparently due to SST modification of stability and mixing in the atmospheric boundary layer and is most clearly manifest in the derivative wind stress fields: wind stress curl and divergence are linearly related to, respectively, the crosswind and downwind components of the local SST gradient. The dynamic range of the Ekman upwelling velocities associated with the summertime SST-induced perturbations of the wind stress curl is larger {{than that of the}} upwelling velocities associated with the mean summertime wind stress curl. This suggests significant feedback effects on the ocean, which likely modify the SST distribution that perturbed the wind stress <b>curl</b> <b>field.</b> The atmosphere and ocean off the west coast of North America must therefore be considered a fully coupled system. It is shown that the observed summertime ocean–atmosphere interaction is poorly represented in the NOAA North American Mesoscale Model (formerly called the Eta Model).

40|$|Adaptation to novel {{dynamics}} requires {{learning a}} motor memory, {{or a new}} pattern of predictive feedforward motor commands. Recently we demonstrated the up-regulation of rapid visuomotor feedback gains early in curl force field learning, which decrease once a predictive motor memory is learned. However, even after learning is complete, these feedback gains are higher than those observed in the null field trials. Interestingly these up-regulated feedback gains in the <b>curl</b> <b>field</b> were not observed in a constant force field. We therefore suggest that adaptation also involves selectively tuning the feedback sensitivity of the sensorimotor control system to the environment. Here we test this hypothesis by measuring the rapid visuomotor feedback gains after subjects adapt {{to a variety of}} novel dynamics generated by a robotic manipulandum in three experiments. To probe the feedback gains, we measured the magnitude of the motor response to rapid shifts in the visual location of the hand during reaching. While the feedback gain magnitude remained similar over a larger than a four-fold increase in constant background load, the feedback gains scaled with increasing lateral resistance and increasing instability. The third experiment demonstrated that the feedback gains could also be independently tuned to perturbations to the left and right depending on the lateral resistance, demonstrating the fractionation of feedback gains to environmental dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the sensorimotor control system regulates the gain of the feedback system as part of the adaptation process to novel dynamics, appropriately tuning them to the environment.
