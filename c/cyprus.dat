5|$|Following {{a decade}} of Cypriot intercommunal {{violence}} and the coup in <b>Cyprus</b> on 15 July 1974 staged by the EOKA B paramilitary organisation, which overthrew President Makarios and installed the pro-Enosis (union with Greece) Nikos Sampson as dictator, Turkey invaded <b>Cyprus</b> on 20 July 1974 by unilaterally exercising Article IV in the Treaty of Guarantee (1960), but without restoring the status quo ante {{at the end of}} the military operation. In 1983 the Turkish Republic of Northern <b>Cyprus,</b> which is recognised only by Turkey, was established. As of 2017, negotiations for solving the <b>Cyprus</b> dispute are still ongoing between Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot political leaders.|$|E
5|$|When Henry I of <b>Cyprus</b> {{reached the}} age of {{majority}} on 3 May 1232, Alice abdicated from her regency of <b>Cyprus,</b> which she had retained despite having left <b>Cyprus.</b> She went to France to personally advance her claim for Champagne and Brie in 1233, but only one local nobleman, Renier II of Nogent, supported her. Theobald IV of Champagne later captured the fortress of Nogent and confiscated Renier's estates.|$|E
5|$|Alice's first husband, Hugh I of <b>Cyprus,</b> born around 1195, {{was the son}} of her stepfather, Aimery of Lusignan, and Aimery's first wife, Eschiva of Ibelin. Alice bore him two daughters, Mary and Isabella, and a son, Henry. Her {{children}} {{remained in}} <b>Cyprus</b> after Alice left the island in 1224.|$|E
5|$|Always {{in need of}} funds, Raynald urged Manuel to {{send the}} promised subsidy to him, but Manuel failed to pay the money. Raynald made an {{alliance}} with Thoros II of Cilicia. They attacked <b>Cyprus,</b> subjecting the Byzantine island to a three-week orgy of violence in early 1156. They only left <b>Cyprus</b> on the rumour of an imperial fleet approaching the island, but only after they had forced all Cypriots to ransom themselves, {{with the exception of}} the wealthiest individuals (including Emperor Manuel's nephew, John Doukas Komnenos), whom they carried off to Antioch. <b>Cyprus</b> would never entirely recover from the devastation that Raynald's and Thoros's marauding raid caused.|$|E

5|$|Complicating {{the account}} of this period {{is the issue of}} the Peace of Callias, which {{allegedly}} ended hostilities between the Greeks and the Persians. The very existence of the treaty is hotly disputed, and its particulars and negotiation are ambiguous. Ernst Badian believes that a peace between Athens and Persia was first ratified in 463 BC (making the Athenian interventions in Egypt and <b>Cyprus</b> violations of the peace), and renegotiated {{at the conclusion of the}} campaign in <b>Cyprus,</b> taking force again by 449–448BC.|$|E
5|$|During {{the wars}} of the Diadochi that {{followed}} the death of Alexander the Great, Ptolemy, who had seized control of Egypt, {{had taken over the}} island of <b>Cyprus</b> and used it as a base of operations against his rival Antigonus I Monophthalmus. From <b>Cyprus,</b> Ptolemy's forces were able to raid the coasts of Syria and Asia Minor. In early 306 BC, Antigonus resolved to remove this threat, and ordered his son, Demetrius, to capture the island. Demetrius at the time was in Greece, where he had in the previous year overthrown the garrison installed in Athens by the ruler of Macedon, Cassander. The city, along with neighbouring Megara, was restored to democratic rule, and allied itself with Demetrius. As a result, when Demetrius sailed from Athens in spring 306 to capture <b>Cyprus,</b> he was accompanied by 30 Athenian quadriremes.|$|E
5|$|Following a 10-day {{training}} camp in <b>Cyprus</b> in February 2012, McLeod {{was named to the}} 21-player roster for the 2012 <b>Cyprus</b> Cup that ran from February 28 to March 6. She appeared in two of Canada's four matches in the tournament, including the final against France. From April until late June, McLeod joined her teammates in an extended residency camp in Vancouver in preparation for the 2012 Olympics. During the camp, the team played in various friendlies; McLeod appeared and started in four friendlies, recording two shutouts.|$|E

5|$|In February 2010, McLeod {{joined the}} {{national}} team for an 18-day training camp that included four matches in the <b>Cyprus</b> Cup and an international friendly against Poland. McLeod started in the friendly against Poland on February 20, recording a clean sheet. She also made one start in the <b>Cyprus</b> Cup against South Africa, allowing one goal. She made one other appearance in 2010 in a friendly in April against China before sustaining another ACL injury in July while playing with the Washington Freedom.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, a Lebanese man was {{detained}} by <b>Cyprus</b> police on possible charges relating to terrorism laws for planning attacks against Israeli tourists. According to security officials, {{the man was}} planning attacks for Hezbollah in <b>Cyprus</b> and admitted this after questioning. The police were alerted about the man due to an urgent message from Israeli intelligence. The Lebanese man was in possession of photographs of Israeli targets and had information on Israeli airlines flying {{back and forth from}} <b>Cyprus,</b> and planned to blow up a plane or tour bus. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Iran assisted the Lebanese man with planning the attacks.|$|E
5|$|In his Bibliotheca, written {{around the}} 1st century B.C. Apollodorus tells of three {{possible}} parentages for Adonis. In the first {{he states that}} Cinyras arrived in <b>Cyprus</b> with a few followers and founded Paphos, and that he married Metharme, eventually becoming king of <b>Cyprus</b> through her family. Cinyras had five children by Metharme: the two boys, Oxyporos and Adonis, and three daughters, Orsedice, Laogore, and Braisia. The daughters at some point became victims of Aphrodite's wrath and had intercourse with foreigners, ultimately dying in Egypt.|$|E

5|$|Kinský {{was called}} up to the Czech Republic {{national}} team by coach Karel Brückner before their participation in two friendly matches in <b>Cyprus</b> in February 2002. He {{was one of three}} uncapped goalkeepers named in the squad, the others being Petr Čech and Martin Vaniak. He made his debut in <b>Cyprus</b> on 13 February, playing {{the second half of the}} game against the host country in a 4–3 win.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Turkish Cypriot {{migration}} to the UK occurred {{as a consequence of}} intercommunal violence in <b>Cyprus</b> during the 1950s and 1960s. Many Turkish Cypriots viewed the EOKA insurgency as an attempt on the part of Greek Cypriots to establish hegemony on the island with the aim of achieving union with Greece. By 1958, there were around 8,500 Turkish Cypriots in Britain. Between 1960 and 1962, the inflow increased substantially because of a fear that Britain would impose immigration controls, and indeed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 did reduce migration flows from <b>Cyprus</b> to Britain. Although the expansion of Britain's Turkish Cypriot community took place primarily between the late 1940s and the mid-1960s, there was a further influx of around 3,000 immigrants after partition in 1974. Migration continued because of the political and economic situation in the 1970s and 1980s, and Turkish Cypriots have continued to migrate to the UK due to high unemployment rates in northern <b>Cyprus.</b> In the early 1980s, it was estimated that 160,000 Cypriots were resident in the UK, 20 to 25 per cent of them being Turkish Cypriots. Since <b>Cyprus</b> joined the European Union in May 2004, holders of Republic of <b>Cyprus</b> passports have been able to migrate freely to the UK under EU law.|$|E
5|$|On 16 June 2006, {{a parade}} {{was held to}} {{celebrate}} Queen Elizabeth II's 80th birthday, at the Episkopi base near Limassol, <b>Cyprus</b> on the Mediterranean island's south coast. Invited dignitaries included the ambassadors of Spain, the Netherlands and Sweden and the Argentine commander of United Nations' forces on <b>Cyprus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Proposals to {{establish}} a joint British airline, combining {{the assets of the}} British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA) were first raised in 1953 as a result of difficulties in attempts by BOAC and BEA to negotiate air rights through the British colony of <b>Cyprus.</b> Increasingly BOAC was protesting that BEA was using its subsidiary <b>Cyprus</b> Airways to circumvent an agreement that BEA would not fly routes further east than <b>Cyprus,</b> particularly to the increasingly important oil regions in the Middle East. The Chairman of BOAC, Miles Thomas, was in favour of merger as a potential solution to this disagreement and had backing for the idea from the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, Rab Butler. However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the proposal.|$|E
5|$|Renoart of Nephin pillaged the {{countryside}} and led his troops to Tripoli in late 1204. Bohemond lost an eye in a battle {{at the gates of}} the town. He could only crush the rebellion after Aimery of <b>Cyprus</b> and Jerusalem died in April 1205. He captured both Nephin and Gibelcar {{before the end of the}} year, forcing Renart to flee to <b>Cyprus.</b> Before long, Bohemond returned to Antioch.|$|E

5|$|T.J. {{was born}} on June 6, 1981 in Beirut, Lebanon. He is of Armenian descent; {{he grew up in}} <b>Cyprus,</b> and came to the US {{for the first time in}} 1999. He is a Fulbright Scholar {{pursuing}} a master's degree in student affairs administration at Michigan State University. Outgoing and involved, T.J. is active in several student organizations pertaining to performance art, gender, and social change. He lives with other students in a housing cooperative. His mother lives in a close-knit Armenian community in <b>Cyprus,</b> where the news would surely travel if T.J. transitions. Because his mother opposes his transition, and because he must return to <b>Cyprus</b> for two years due to a travel visa requirement, he has not yet started HRT.|$|E

5|$|The naval Battle of Salamis in 306 BC {{took place}} near Salamis, <b>Cyprus</b> between the fleets of Ptolemy I of Egypt and Antigonus I Monophthalmus, {{two of the}} Diadochi, the generals who, {{after the death of}} Alexander the Great, fought each other for control of his empire. Antigonus' fleet was led by his son Demetrius, who had invaded <b>Cyprus</b> and was besieging Ptolemy's brother Menelaus at Salamis. The battle was a {{complete}} victory for Demetrius, and resulted in the surrender of Menelaus and his capture of <b>Cyprus.</b> As a result, Antigonus assumed the royal title that had been vacant since the murder of Alexander's underage son, followed by the other Diadochi soon after.|$|E
5|$|Three {{species of}} {{hippopotamus}}, the European hippopotamus (Hippopotamus antiquus), Hippopotamus major and Hippopotamus gorgops, ranged throughout continental Europe and the British Isles. All three species became extinct {{before the last}} glaciation. Ancestors of European hippos {{found their way to}} many islands of the Mediterranean Sea during the Pleistocene. The Pleistocene also saw a number of dwarf species evolve on several Mediterranean islands, including Crete (Hippopotamus creutzburgi), <b>Cyprus</b> (the <b>Cyprus</b> dwarf hippopotamus, Hippopotamus minor), Malta (Hippopotamus melitensis), and Sicily (Hippopotamus pentlandi). Of these, the <b>Cyprus</b> dwarf hippopotamus survived {{until the end of the}} Pleistocene or early Holocene. Evidence from an archaeological site, Aetokremnos, continues to cause debate on whether or not the species was encountered, and was driven to extinction, by man.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Constantinople, he was tasked (late 1092/early 1093), along with Manuel Boutoumites, with the {{suppression}} of the revolts in Crete by Karykes and in <b>Cyprus</b> by Rhapsomates. The rebellion of Karykes was subdued easily, as the news of the imperial fleet's approach caused a counter-coup that overthrew him. At <b>Cyprus,</b> Rhapsomates's initial resistance was overcome, and he himself was captured soon after. Eumathios Philokales was installed as the island's new governor, and the fleet returned to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|When Philip of Ibelin died, the High Court {{appointed}} his brother, John of Ibelin, as bailli {{without consulting}} the emperor or Alice. Frederick departed for <b>Cyprus,</b> landing at Limassol on 21 July 1228. Upon arriving, he ordered John of Ibelin {{to account for}} the administration of the revenue of <b>Cyprus</b> during his and his brother's time, but John refused, stating that the revenue had been paid to Alice. Frederick dismissed Ibelin and forced Henry I of <b>Cyprus</b> to swear fealty to him. He also demanded an oath of fealty from the Cypriot noblemen, but they were only willing to submit to him as their king's overlord, declaring that they only owed fealty to Alice who served as regent to their king. Frederick made Aimery Barlais, Gavin of Chenichy, Aimaury of Beisan, Hugh of Jebail and William of Rivet baillis of <b>Cyprus</b> without Alice's consent before departing for Italy in May 1229. Peter I, Duke of Brittany declared that he wanted to marry Alice, but this was refused on 29 May by Pope Gregory because of consanguinity.|$|E

The Nile River meanders in the far distance, emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the Nile Delta. South of <b>Cyprus</b> is the Sinai Peninsula, which forms a land bridge between Africa and Southwest Asia.

5|$|By early 1570, the Ottoman {{preparations}} and {{the warnings}} {{sent by the}} Venetian bailo at Constantinople, Marco Antonio Barbaro, had convinced the Signoria that war was imminent. Reinforcements and money were sent post-haste to Crete and <b>Cyprus.</b> In March 1570, an Ottoman envoy was sent to Venice, bearing an ultimatum that demanded the immediate cession of <b>Cyprus.</b> Although some voices were raised in the Venetian Signoria advocating the cession of the island in exchange for land in Dalmatia and further trading privileges, the hope of assistance from the other Christian states stiffened the Republic's resolve, and the ultimatum was categorically rejected.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} left-wing {{political}} beliefs, {{members of the}} new clubs were not accepted into the <b>Cyprus</b> Football Association (CFA) and they established a new football federation (the <b>Cyprus</b> Amateur Football Federation, or CAFF) in December 1948. The new federation organized leagues and cups, which attracted thousands of fans. The CAFF matches became more popular than those of the CFA. Six teams belonged to the CAFF: Nea Salamina in Famagusta, Omonia and Orfeas in Nicosia, Alki at Larnaca, AMOL at Limassol (renamed Antaeus in 1951) and Neos Asteras in Morphou.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his service}} in Korea, Mitchell was posted in Britain, but in late 1957, he {{returned}} to the Argylls as a company commander with the 1st Battalion, and was posted to <b>Cyprus.</b> At the time, the <b>Cyprus</b> Emergency was in full swing. Mitchell was placed in charge of the coastal towns of Paphos and Ktima, where his men engaged in counter-insurgency operations against EOKA guerrillas. They faced both conventional EOKA raids and forest fires deliberately lit by EOKA fighters and local villagers who were motivated by the money they would receive to fight them.|$|E
5|$|For {{their first}} World Cup {{qualifying}} campaign, Andorra were drawn {{in a group}} with <b>Cyprus,</b> Estonia, Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal. They lost their opening match 1–0 to Estonia. In the next game, they lost 3–2 to <b>Cyprus</b> but scored their first World Cup qualifying goals. They were again defeated by Estonia, this time 2–1. They lost all their matches and their only away goal was in a 3–1 loss against Ireland. Their worst defeat was 7–1 to Portugal on a neutral ground in Lleida, Spain. Andorra finished the campaign with no points and conceded 36 goals in ten matches.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-450s the Athenians {{launched}} an unsuccessful attempt to aid an Egyptian revolt against Persia, {{which led to}} a prolonged siege of a Persian fortress in the Nile Delta. The campaign culminated in disaster; the besieging force was defeated and destroyed. In 451–450 BC the Athenians sent troops to <b>Cyprus.</b> Cimon defeated the Persians in the Battle of Salamis-in-Cyprus, but died of disease in 449BC. Pericles is said to have initiated both expeditions in Egypt and <b>Cyprus,</b> although some researchers, such as Karl Julius Beloch, argue that the dispatch of such a great fleet conforms with the spirit of Cimon's policy.|$|E
