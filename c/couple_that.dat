5|$|Kapoor's {{personal}} {{life is the}} subject of fervent tabloid reporting in India. During the filming of Fida in 2004, he began dating Kareena Kapoor and they both publicly spoke of the relationship. They were involved in a well-publicised scandal when Mid Day published a set of pictures of them kissing in public. Despite claims by the <b>couple</b> <b>that</b> the pictures were fabricated, the newspaper denied any wrongdoing. The couple separated in 2007 during the filming of Jab We Met. Since their split, Kapoor decided to keep his {{personal life}} away from media attention. However, tabloids speculated on his relationship with several other actresses, including Vidya Balan and Priyanka Chopra.|$|E
40|$|Coupling is {{considered}} by many to be an important concept in measuring design quality. There is still much to be learned about which aspects of coupling affect design quality or other external attributes of software. Much of the existing work concentrates on direct <b>coupling,</b> <b>that</b> is, forms of <b>coupling</b> <b>that</b> exists between entities that are directly related to each other. A form of <b>coupling</b> <b>that</b> has so far received little attention is indirect <b>coupling,</b> <b>that</b> is, <b>coupling</b> between entities <b>that</b> are not directly related. What little discussion there is in the literature suggests that any form of indirect coupling is simple the transitive closure of a form of direct coupling. We will demonstrate that this is not the case, that there are forms of indirect <b>coupling</b> <b>that</b> cannot be represented in this way, and suggest ways to measure it. We will present a tool that identifies a particular form of indirect <b>coupling</b> <b>that</b> is integrated in the Eclipse IDE. ...|$|R

Living Elves cannot be raped or forced to have sex; before that they will lose the will to endure and go to Mandos.|$|E
5|$|Alisa Smith and J. B. MacKinnon's idea {{of local}} eating began while visiting their cabin in {{northern}} British Columbia in August 2004. Their food supplies were nearly exhausted so {{to feed their}} dinner guests they scrounged the surrounding land for food. Their dinner of Dolly Varden trout, wild mushrooms, dandelion leaves, apples, sour cherries, and rose hips, along with potatoes and garlic from the garden, so impressed the <b>couple</b> <b>that</b> once back home, in their Kitsilano apartment in Vancouver, they pursued the idea of eating only local food. They eventually decided to try a diet consisting of eating food, for one year, grown within 100 miles of their home. They began the diet symbolically {{on the first day}} of spring, March 21. Beginning in June, they wrote articles for The Tyee about their experience. The couple, both in their 30s, each had experience in writing: Smith as a freelance journalist who had taught non-fiction writing, and MacKinnon as the author of the award-winning historical non-fiction book Dead Man in Paradise and a past editor of Adbusters magazine.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Marcella Saunders, a 23-year-old {{teacher at}} Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, found that her ninth-grade {{students}} {{were unable to}} read the short stories and poetry in the class textbook. She thought that, because her students were more familiar with television than poetry or short stories, she would have more success in teaching her students if she taught them {{by way of a}} television series. She found that her students liked Bewitched, Room 222, and Julia, so she contacted the corresponding television studios to tell them about her idea. Only Bewitched responded. Having gained an audience with Montgomery and her husband William Asher, Saunders told the <b>couple</b> <b>that</b> most students at the school were unable to read, write, or comprehend at a high school level, with 44% reading at a third grade level and very few students reading at a level much higher than that; less than 1% were reading at a ninth grade level. Saunders added that Bewitched was the students' favorite television series.|$|E

30|$|The {{implementing}} of “universal two-child policy” can {{relieve the}} pressure of population aging, and further contributes to the decline of retirement proportion of pension fund. Actuarially, if 13 % of <b>couples</b> <b>that</b> satisfy the requirement of “universal two-child policy” would have the second child, the retirement proportion of pension fund system in 2090 would be 0.6926, which decreases by 0.0612 compared with continually implementing “one-child policy” while decreases by 0.0237 {{in comparison with the}} situation that 13 % of <b>couples</b> <b>that</b> satisfy the requirement of “selective one-child policy”.
