5|$|In the United States, Teenage Dream: The Complete <b>Confection</b> boosted {{sales of}} the {{original}} Teenage Dream, which consequently re-entered the top-ten of the Billboard 200 at number seven with first-week sales of 33,000 copies. This resulted in a 190%-increase from the previous tracking week, in which the original record stood at number 31. A similar situation occurred on the UK Albums Chart, where The Complete <b>Confection</b> helped Teenage Dream rise from number 34 to number six after the former was released. The Complete <b>Confection</b> peaked at number two on the Official New Zealand Music Chart, aided by the combined {{sales of the}} two versions.|$|E
5|$|In the UK, a toffee apple is a {{traditional}} <b>confection</b> made by coating an apple in hot toffee and allowing it to cool. Similar treats in the U.S. are candy apples (coated in a hard shell of crystallized sugar syrup), and caramel apples, coated with cooled caramel.|$|E

50|$|Generally, <b>confections</b> {{are low in}} micronutrients {{and protein}} but high in calories. They may be {{fat-free}} foods, although some <b>confections,</b> especially fried doughs, are high-fat foods. Many <b>confections</b> are considered empty calories.|$|R
50|$|The {{company has}} {{acquired}} several famous brands of <b>confections</b> such as The Candy Corporation of America's Mason Division (1972), Cella's <b>Confections</b> (1985), The Charms Company (1988), Warner-Lambert's candy division (1993; excluding gum and mints), Andes Candies (2000), and Concord <b>Confections</b> (2004).|$|R
5|$|Upon its release, Teenage Dream: The Complete <b>Confection</b> was {{met with}} {{generally}} mixed reviews from music critics, who were ambivalent towards the new songs' production and questioned the decision to reissue Teenage Dream. As an independent release, the reissue reached the top ten in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It has sold one million copies globally.|$|E
5|$|Palestinian desserts include baklawa, halawa and kanafeh, as well {{as other}} {{semolina}} and wheat pastries. Baklawa is a pastry made of thin sheets of unleavened flour dough (phyllo), filled with pistachios and walnuts sweetened by honey. Burma Til-Kadayif, or simply Burma, especially popular in East Jerusalem, has the same filling as baklawa, but is cylndrical in shape and made with kanafeh dough instead of phyllo. Halawa is a block <b>confection</b> of sweetened sesame flour served in sliced pieces. Muhalabiyeh is a rice pudding made with milk and topped with pistachios or almonds.|$|E
5|$|What keeps this densely {{realised}} <b>confection</b> aloft is {{that very}} quality of reverence to {{the writers of}} the past. The chief character in Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell isn't, in fact, either of the magicians: it's the library that they both adore, the books they consult and write and, in a sense, become. Clarke's giddiness comes from finding a way at once to enter the company of her literary heroes, to pay them homage and {{to add to the}} literature.|$|E
50|$|Concerns {{regarding}} the increasingly {{excessive use of}} <b>confections</b> that use large amount of oil, grain, and honey has consequently lead to several regulations {{throughout the course of}} its history. In 1117, King Sukjong issued a restriction on the extravagant usage of deep-fried grain <b>confections.</b> In 1192, it was commanded to replace deep-fried grain <b>confections</b> with fruits. In 1353, a total ban was placed on deep-fried grain <b>confections.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sugar {{confectionery}} includes sweets, candy, candied nuts, chocolates, {{chewing gum}} and bubblegum, sweetmeats, pastillage, and other <b>confections</b> {{that are made}} primarily of sugar. In some cases, chocolate <b>confections</b> (<b>confections</b> made of chocolate) are treated as a separate category, as are sugar-free versions of sugar <b>confections.</b> The words candy (US and Canada), sweets (UK and Ireland), and lollies (Australia and New Zealand) are common words for the most common varieties of sugar confectionery.|$|R
50|$|Bakers' confectionery, {{also called}} flour <b>confections,</b> {{includes}} principally sweet pastries, cakes, and similar baked goods. In the Middle East and Asia, flour-based <b>confections</b> are more dominant.|$|R
5|$|Elsewhere, The Complete <b>Confection</b> {{performed}} moderately as an independently charting release. In Europe, {{the record}} respectively peaked at numbers 14 and 29 on the Belgian Flanders and Wallonia charts, both managed by Ultratop. It also reached number four on the French Albums Chart and number 18 on The Official Finnish Charts. The project was less successful on the Dutch MegaCharts and the Swedish Sverigetopplistan, where it respectively peaked at numbers 44 and 48. In Oceania, it peaked at number five on the Australian ARIA Charts. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), the album has sold over 1 million copies worldwide as of 2013.|$|E
5|$|In Thailand, durian {{is often}} eaten fresh with sweet sticky rice, and blocks of durian paste {{are sold in}} the markets, though much of the paste is {{adulterated}} with pumpkin. Unripe durians may be cooked as a vegetable, except in the Philippines, where all uses are sweet rather than savoury. Malaysians make both sugared and salted preserves from durian. When durian is minced with salt, onions and vinegar, it is called boder. The durian seeds, which are the size of chestnuts, can be eaten whether they are boiled, roasted or fried in coconut oil, with a texture {{that is similar to}} taro or yam, but stickier. In Java, the seeds are sliced thin and cooked with sugar as a <b>confection.</b> Uncooked durian seeds are potentially toxic due to cyclopropene fatty acids and should not be ingested.|$|E
5|$|Several {{important}} {{buildings are}} located in the district. At Warder Park the old Carnegie Library still stands, one of many built throughout Indiana in the early 20th Century. Across Spring Street from Warder Park is the Old Masonic Temple, built in the early 20th Century, with a majestic marble staircase. The local office of the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana maintains the historic Grisamore House, its former office, and the Willey-Allhands House, its current office, which are located beside each other. Schimpff's Confectionery is well known its candies, especially its red-hots and Modjelskas (a caramel-covered marshmallow <b>confection).</b> Horner's Novelty, a long-time commercial supplier of party supplies and costumes that was rebuilt after a fire, is also included in the landmark boundaries.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dental erosion is an {{increasingly}} prevalent problem associated with frequent consumption of acidic foods and beverages. The {{aim of this}} study was to measure the food acid content and the erosive potential of a variety of sugar-free <b>confections.</b> METHODS: Thirty sugar-free <b>confections</b> were selected and extracts analysed to determine pH, titratable acidity, chemical composition and apparent degree of saturation with respect to apatite. The effect of the sugar-free <b>confections</b> in artificial saliva on human enamel was determined in an in vitro dental erosion assay using change in surface microhardness. RESULTS: The change in surface microhardness was used to categorize the <b>confections</b> as high, moderate or low erosive potential. Seventeen of the 30 sugar-free <b>confections</b> were found to contain high concentrations of food acids, exhibit low pH and high titratable acidity and have high erosive potential. Significant correlations were found between the dental erosive potential (change in enamel surface microhardness) and pH and titratable acidity of the <b>confections.</b> Ten of these high erosive potential <b>confections</b> displayed dental messages on the packaging suggesting they were safe for teeth. CONCLUSIONS: Many sugar-free <b>confections,</b> even some with 'Toothfriendly' messages on the product label, contain high contents of food acids and have erosive potential. embarg...|$|R
50|$|Confectionery, {{also called}} sweets or candy, is sweet food. The term varies among English-speaking countries. In general, though, {{confectionery}} {{is divided into}} two broad and somewhat overlapping categories, bakers' <b>confections</b> and sugar <b>confections.</b>|$|R
50|$|Passing the two Buddhist dynasties, Unified Silla {{in the era}} of two kingdoms (698-926) and Goryeo (936‒1392), the {{cultivation}} of crops and consumption of <b>confections</b> increased drastically as the Buddhist diets forbade meat. <b>Confections</b> were offered in Goryeo's national feasts, rites, ceremonies, and banquets, including the two Buddhist festivals, the Lotus Lantern Festival, and the Festival of the Eight Vows. Prevailing tea ceremonies also required more types of <b>confections.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this work, three {{freeze-dried}} (FD) {{egg products}} (whole egg (WE), egg yolk (EY) and egg white (EW)) were obtained and {{the acceptability of}} <b>confections</b> prepared with each was evaluated. Sensory analyses for <b>confections</b> were performed by hedonic testing with fifty panelists in each evaluation. The studied <b>confections</b> were: Condensed Milk Pudding (P), Quindim (Q) and Meringue (M). The results obtained for <b>confections</b> made with FD egg products were compared with the achieved through other formulations of the same desserts made with fresh (F) or spray-dried (SD) egg products. The sensory analysis results for <b>confections</b> made with FD egg products showed good acceptance by panelists. A principal component analysis of the sensory evaluation data was carried out to identify similarities between the different egg products. The PCA supported the conclusion that FD egg products can substitute their fresh and SD counterparts in dessert formulations with good acceptability while keeping the advantages conferred by the freeze-drying method...|$|R
