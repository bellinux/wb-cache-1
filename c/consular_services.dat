5000|$|The American Foreign Service Association was {{preceded by}} The American <b>Consular</b> <b>Service</b> Association {{which was founded in}} the spring of 1918. In March 1919 the American <b>Consular</b> <b>Service</b> Association {{published}} the first issue of the American Consular Bulletin. The diplomatic and consular branches of the State Department were combined into a single Foreign Service by the Rogers Act of 1924 and, as a result, the American <b>Consular</b> <b>Service</b> Association gave way to the American Foreign Service Association. It was decided to continue the monthly American Consular Bulletin as the official publication of the expanded association. In 1924, with the publication of the October issue, the title of the bulletin was changed to American Foreign Service Journal. The publication's name was shortened to its present form, the Foreign Service Journal, with the publication of the August, 1951, issue.|$|R
