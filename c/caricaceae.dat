40|$|Uma das principais doenças que afeta o meloeiro é a mancha-aquosa, causada pela bactéria Acidovorax avenae subsp. citrulli (Aac). Visando conhecer hospedeiros alternativos de Aac, plantas no estágio de primeiras folhas definitivas, de várias espécies/cultivares, incluindo cucurbitáceas, solanáceas, gramíneas, leguminosas e <b>caricáceas,</b> foram inoculadas pela atomização da parte aérea com suspensão dos isolados Aac 1. 49 e Aac 12. 13, oriundos de melão e melancia, respectivamente. A suscetibilidade das plantas aos isolados foi avaliada pelo período de incubação (PI) e incidência da doença (INC). Caupi, feijão, fumo e milho não apresentaram sintomas. Os menores PIs foram observados em cucurbitáceas (3, 0 d), com exceção da bucha (6, 83 d). Incidências da doença acima de 90 % foram observadas em cucurbitáceas, excetuando a bucha e em solanáceas, para ambos os isolados de Aac. Em outro experimento, frutos de abóbora, abobrinha, berinjela, mamão, maxixe, melancia, melão, pepino, pimentão e tomate foram analisados quanto à suscetibilidade aos isolados Aac 1. 49 e Aac 12. 13. Os frutos foram inoculados pelo método de injeção subepidérmica, determinando-se PI, INC e severidade, avaliada pelo diâmetro da lesão externa (DLE) e profundidade da lesão (PL). Menores PIs (2, 0 d) foram detectados em frutos de mamão, melancia, melão e pimentão. Incidência de 100 % foi observada em todos os frutos inoculados, com exceção da abobrinha (93, 75 %) e da abóbora (34, 37 %). Maiores DLEs foram observados em pepino (1, 47 cm) para o isolado Aac 1. 49 e em melancia (1, 60 cm) e melão (1, 07 cm) para Aac 12. 13. As maiores PL foram constatadas em melancia (1, 72 e 0, 75 cm) respectivamente para Aac 1. 49 e Aac 12. 13. Frutos de berinjela não apresentaram sintomas externos embora as lesões internas tenham sido profundas. One of {{the most}} {{important}} melon diseases is the bacterial blotch caused by Acidovorax avenae subsp. citrulli (Aac). Alternative hosts of this bacterium were determined in plants at the first true leaf stage of several species/cultivars, including cucurbits, solanaceous, gramineous, leguminous and caricaceous species. They were inoculated by spraying foliage with bacterial suspensions of strains Aac 1. 49 and Aac 12. 13, isolated from melon and watermelon, respectively. The susceptibility of plants was evaluated based on the incubation period (PI) and disease incidence (INC). Cowpea, bean, tobacco and maize did not show symptoms. The lowest PIs were observed in cucurbits (3. 0 d), except sponge gourd (6. 83 d). Disease incidences higher than 90 % were observed in cucurbits, except sponge gourd, and in solanaceous species for both Aac strains. In another experiment, fruits of pumpkin, squash, eggplant, papaya, bur gourd, watermelon, melon, cucumber, bell pepper and tomato were analyzed for susceptibility to strains Aac 1. 49 and Aac 12. 13. Fruits were inoculated by sub-epidermal injection. PI and INC were determined and disease severity was evaluated by measuring external lesion diameter (DLE) and lesion depth (PL). Lowest PIs (2. 0 d) were detected in fruits of papaya, watermelon, melon and bell pepper. One hundred percent incidence was observed in all inoculated fruits excepting squash (93. 75 %) and pumpkin (34. 37 %). Highest DLEs were seen in cucumber (1. 47 cm) for strain Aac 1. 49, and by watermelon (1. 60 cm) and melon (1. 70 cm) for Aac 12. 13. Highest PLs were presented by watermelon (1. 72 and 0. 75 cm respectively for strains Aac 1. 49 and Aac 12. 13). Eggplant fruits did not show external symptoms but internal lesions were deep...|$|R

40|$|The {{chloroplast}} and mitochondrial DNA {{diversity of}} 61 genotypes belonging to 18 Vasconcellea species, the so-called highland papayas, was studied by PCR-RFLP analysis of two non-coding cpDNA regions (trnM-rbcL and trnK 1 -trnK 2) and one non-coding mtDNA region (nad 4 / 1 -nad 4 / 2). This sample set {{was supplemented with}} six genotypes belonging to three other <b>Caricaceae</b> genera: the monotypic genus Carica, including only the cultivated papaya, and the genera Jacaratia and Cylicomorpha. Moringa ovalifolia was added as an outgroup species. The PCR-amplified cpDNA regions were digested with 18 restriction endonucleases, the mtDNA region with 11. A total of 22 point mutations and four insertion/deletions were scored in the sample. A higher level of interspecific variation was detected in the two cpDNA regions {{in comparison to the}} analysis of the mtDNA. Wagner parsimony and Neighbor-Joining analysis resulted in dendrograms with similar topologies. PCR-RFLP analysis supported the monophyly of <b>Caricaceae,</b> but among the 26 mutations scored, an insufficient number of markers discriminated between the different <b>Caricaceae</b> genera included in this study. Hence the inference of the intergeneric relationships within <b>Caricaceae</b> was impossible. However, some conclusions can be noted at a lower taxonomic level. The <b>Caricaceae</b> species were divided into two lineages. One group included only Vasconcellea spp., whereas the second included the remaining Vasconcellea spp., together with the papaya genotypes and those from the other <b>Caricaceae</b> genera. This may indicate a higher level of inter-fertility for the Vasconcellea species from the latter clade in interspecific crossings with papaya. The putative progenitors of the natural sterile hybrid V. x heilbornii, i. e. V. stipulata and V. cundinamarcensis, were only distantly related to V. x heilbornii. This indicates that probably none of these species was involved as the maternal progenitor in the origin of V. x heilbornii. Surprisingly, V. x heilbornii had organellar genome patterns identical with V. weberbaueri, suggesting a possible involvement of this species in the origin of V. x heilbornii. On the basis of discrepancy between morphological traits and the cpDNA profiles of some pairs of Vasconcellea species, we believe that besides V. x heilbornii, some other species have originated through interspecific hybridization. A reticulate evolution for Vasconcellea has therefore been suggested. Finally, intraspecific cpDNA variation was detected in V. microcarpa, thus providing molecular evidence for the high diversity previously indicated by morphological observations...|$|E
40|$|Beyond {{their own}} {{commercial}} potential, highland papayas (Vasconcellea spp.) bear genes for resistances against important diseases, cold hardiness, and monoecy, which are {{absent from the}} common papaya genome. While the two genera share many morphological traits, strong reproductive barriers have considerably limited the success of introgression programs, imposing the use of special techniques for hybridizations. In fact, all cytogenetic and genetic studies have consistently shown that Vasconcellea is relatively distant from Carica as compared to other <b>Caricaceae</b> genera. A few {{years after the first}} breakthrough obtained in the field, the present chapter reviews the potential of the different highland papaya species as sources of genes for papaya improvement, the considerable experience accumulated in the different hybridization programs, the advantages of this difficult approach, and its current perspectives. It also stresses the need for further exploration within Vasconcellea and closer genera of the <b>Caricaceae.</b> After the successful introgression of papaya ring spot virus resistance from V. quercifolia, the combination of marker-assisted selection, new breeding schemes (e. g., bridging species), and a deeper knowledge of <b>Caricaceae</b> gene pools should give access to more genes of considerable interest to the papaya industry.

40|$|The <b>Caricaceae</b> is a {{small family}} of {{tropical}} trees and herbs in which most species are dioecious. In the present study, we extend our previous work on dioecy in the <b>Caricaceae,</b> characterising the morphological variation in sexual expression in flowers of the dioecious tree Jacaratia mexicana. We found that, in J. mexicana, female plants produce only pistillate flowers, while male plants are sexually variable and can bear three different types of flowers: staminate, pistillate and perfect. To characterise the distinct types of flowers, we measured 26 morphological variables. Our results indicate that: (i) pistillate flowers from male trees carry healthy-looking ovules and are morphologically similar, although smaller than, pistillate flowers on female plants; (ii) staminate flowers have a rudimentary, non-functional pistil and are the only flowers capable of producing nectar; and (iii) perfect flowers produce healthy- looking ovules and pollen, but have smaller ovaries than pistillate flowers and fewer anthers than staminate flowers, and do not produce nectar. The restriction of sexual variation to male trees {{is consistent with the}} evolutionary path of dioecy from hermaphrodite ancestors through the initial invasion of male-sterile plants and a subsequent gradual reduction in female fertility in cosexual individuals (gynodioecy pathway), but further work is needed to confirm this hypothesis...|$|E
