40|$|In {{this article}} we explore {{approaches}} to curriculum in the primary school in order to map and manage the omissions implicit in the current unfolding of the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement for mathematics. The focus of school-based research has been on curriculum coverage and cognitive depth. To address the challenges of teaching mathematics {{from the perspective of}} the learner, we ask whether the learners engage with the subject in such a way that they build foundations for more advanced mathematics. We firstly discuss three approaches that inform the teaching of mathematics in the primary school and which may be taken singly or in conjunction into organising the curriculum: the topics approach, the process approach, and the <b>conceptual</b> <b>fields</b> approach. Each of the approaches is described and evaluated by presenting both their advantages and disadvantages. We then expand on the <b>conceptual</b> <b>fields</b> approach by means of an illustrative example. The planning of an instructional design integrates both a topics and a process approach into a <b>conceptual</b> <b>fields</b> approach. To address conceptual depth within this approach, we draw on five dimensions required for understanding a mathematical concept. In conclusion, we reflect on an approach to curriculum development that draws on the integrated theory of <b>conceptual</b> <b>fields</b> to support teachers and learners in the quest for improved teaching and learning...|$|R

40|$|The {{goals of}} this study is to define the <b>conceptual</b> <b>field</b> of jouissance, {{transversely}} between the freudian and the lacanian theory, and to hypothesize some neurophysiological mechanisms that could be in relation to several clinical phenomena in which jouissance becomes "kindled" and beyond the control of the symbolic processes. First the author gives a brief introduction on Lacan's concept of jouissance and Freud's work on early stages of this <b>conceptual</b> <b>field</b> (Lust, Genuss, Libido etc) and describes the preamble of this <b>conceptual</b> <b>field</b> of Lacan's work. Afterwards the jouissance is put in relation to two other concepts : the concept of "repetition" - with its freudien and lacanian nuances - and the -exclusively - lacanian concept of the "object little-a". Then there is a analysis of Lacan's final conceptualization of language as jouissance, (the "lalangue" concept) in relation with Freud's early ideas (letter 52) on the different kind of inscriptions that give birth to the mental apparatus. In the last part the author takes the challenge to hypothesize a neurophysiological mechanism on the base of some clinical situations in which jouissance becomes "kindled" and surpasses the control of symbolic processes through the neurophysiological mechanisms of "kindling", "sensitization" and "excitoxicity". Other authors have also attempted this kind of correlation - between the concept of jouissance and neurophysiology - but through other neurobiological concepts...|$|E

40|$|The article explores ‘commonwealth’ {{both as a}} {{term and}} a <b>conceptual</b> <b>field</b> across the early modern period, with a {{particular}} focus on the Anglophone world. The shifts of usage of ‘commonwealth’ are explored, from a term {{used to describe the}} polity, to one used to describe a particular, republican form of polity, through to its eclipse in the eighteenth century by other terms such as ‘nation’ and ‘state’. But the article also investigates the variety of usages during any one time, especially at moments of crisis, and the network of related terms that constituted ‘commonwealth’. That investigation requires, it is argued, not just a textual approach but one that embraces social custom and practice, as well as the study of literary and visual forms through which the keyword ‘commonwealth’ was constructed. The article emphasizes the importance of social context to language; the forms, metaphors and images used to describe and depict the polity; and to show how linguistic change could occur through the transmutation of elements of the <b>conceptual</b> <b>field</b> that endowed the keyword with its meaning...|$|E
