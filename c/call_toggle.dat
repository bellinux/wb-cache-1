Toggle memory supports both reversible programming and charge recovery. Circuits designed using the principles delineated below permit matchlines to charge and discharge with near zero energy dissipation.

50|$|In theater, a brace is {{a sliding}} {{piece of wood}} or metal with a 'butterfly' winged nut to make it longer or shorter to fit the flat used to {{stabilize}} a flat set piece such as a flat. The nut is used, {{so that it can}} be changed more quickly than a screw to the floor during a quick change. Usually, a brace is painted black to make it less noticeable to the audience. Braces are often used to form a triangle between two perpendicular items (like a vertical flat and a stage. They can also make a flat piece stronger by forming an X-shape between all four corners. Another way to brace a rectangular flat is to use special braces, <b>called</b> <b>toggles</b> which run at regular intervals, parallel to the short end of the flat, effectively breaking it into many smaller, stronger rectangles.|$|R
50|$|LittleBigPlanet 3 {{introduces}} {{three new}} characters {{in addition to}} Sackboy, each with their own unique traits and abilities. OddSock is a four-legged, dog-like character who can run faster than Sackboy and can wall-jump. Swoop is a bird-like character who can fly freely around levels and can pick up other light objects. In addition to objects, Swoop can pick up other characters, {{with the exception of}} Big Toggle. Toggle is another character, who can transform between a large, heavy version and a small, light version. The larger version, <b>called</b> Big <b>Toggle,</b> is much heavier than Sackboy and can weigh down platforms or pressure plates. His miniature version is <b>called</b> Little <b>Toggle,</b> and can walk quickly on the surface of water, is very small and can fit through tight spaces. Level creators have the ability to allow players to play as more than one character during gameplay. In addition, Sackboy has a climbing ability which works on rope-based textures like vines.|$|R

40|$|Motion {{planning}} {{has received}} much attention {{over the past}} 40 years. More than 15 {{years have passed since}} the introduction of the successful sampling-based approach known as the Probabilistic RoadMap Method (PRM). PRM and its many variants have demonstrated great success for some high-dimensional problems, but they all have some level of difficulty in the presence of narrow passages. Recently, an approach <b>called</b> <b>Toggle</b> PRM has been introduced whose performance does not degrade for 2 -dimensional problems with narrow passages. In Toggle PRM, a simultaneous, coordinated mapping of both C free and C obst is performed and every connection attempt augments one of the maps – either validating an edge in the current space or adding a configuration ’witnessing’ the connection failure to the other space. In this paper, we generalize Toggle PRM to d-dimensions and show that the benefits of mapping both C free and C obst continue to hold in higher dimensions. In particular, we introduce a new narrow passage characterization, α-ε-separable narrow passages, which describes the types of passages that can be successfully mapped by Toggle PRM. Intuitively, α-ε-separable narrow passages are arbitrarily narrow regions of C free that separate regions of C obst, at least locally, such as hallways in an office building. We experimentally compare Toggle PRM with other methods in a variety of scenarios with different types of narrow passages and robots with up to 16 dof...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{identified}} and characterized a special multi-degree of freedom <b>toggle</b> behavior, <b>called</b> double <b>toggle,</b> {{observed in a}} typical MCCB switching mechanism. For an idealized system, the condition of toggle sequence is derived geometrically. The existing tools available in a multi-body dynamics package are used for exploring the dynamic behavior of such systems parametrically. The double toggle mechanism is found {{to make the system}} insensitive to the operator's behavior; however, the system is vulnerable under extreme usage. The linkage kinematics and stopper locations are found to have dominant role on the behavior of the system. It is revealed that the operating time is immune to the inertial property of the input link and sensitive to that of the output link. Novel designs exploiting this observation, in terms of spring and toggle placements, to enhance switching performance have also been reported in the paper. Detailed study revealed that strategic placement of the spring helps in selective alteration of system performance. Thus, the study establishes the critical importance of the kinematic design of MCCB over the dynamic parameters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

But, as in Conway’s Game-of-Life [5], interesting questions arise when we iterate. Figure 1 shows the result of applying our rule repeatedly to a sequence of 20 pebbles. Note that the behavior of the first few pebbles is simply periodic, but more complicated patterns emerge further down the line. We are trying to understand exactly how complicated these orbits are. A moment’s thought reveals that the toggle operation is reversible, so the orbit of any sequence must be a cycle. A few computational experiments suggest that the length of the cycle associated with a sequence of length n is about 2 n/ 2 and thus has exponential length. This leads to a natura...|$|R
40|$|Background: Synthetic {{microbial}} consortia are conglomerations {{of genetically}} engineered microbes programmed to cooperatively bring about population-level phenotypes. By coordinating their activity, the constituent strains can display emergent behaviors {{that are difficult to}} engineer into isogenic populations. To do so, strains are engineered to communicate with one another through intercellular signaling pathways that depend on cell density. Methods: Here, we used computational modeling to examine how the behavior of synthetic microbial consortia results from the interplay between population dynamics governed by cell growth and internal transcriptional dynamics governed by cell-cell signaling. Specifically, we examined a synthetic microbial consortium in which two strains each produce signals that down-regulate transcription in the other. Within a single strain this regulatory topology is <b>called</b> a “co-repressive <b>toggle</b> switch” and can lead to bistability. Results: We found that in co-repressive synthetic microbial consortia the existence and stability of different states depend on population-level dynamics. As the two strains passively compete for space within the colony, their relative fractions fluctuate and thus alter the strengths of intercellular signals. These fluctuations drive the consortium to alternative equilibria. Additionally, if the growth rates of the strains depend on their transcriptional states, an additional feedback loop is created that can generate oscillations. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that the dynamics of microbial consortia cannot be predicted from their regulatory topologies alone, but are also determined by interactions between the strains. Therefore, when designing synthetic microbial consortia that use intercellular signaling, one must account for growth variations caused by the production of protein...|$|R
