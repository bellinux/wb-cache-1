The emergence of hollow fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composite tubes as a structural component provided the industry to consider this material as a potential <b>composite</b> <b>pile</b> type as they can carry design load. However, issue such as driving performance of this material warrants investigation as they are considered the lowest performer among composite piles. The thin-walled section generally ruptures under high driving stresses, thus its stiffness for post-impact performance is in question. This paper experimentally investigated the effects of impact energy and number of impacts on the axial stiffness of hollow FRP composite tubes. Six incident energy variants were considered, and two specimens for a given impact energy were subjected {{to a maximum of}} 130 repeated impacts using a drop-weight impact tester. The impact response and the contact stiffness were evaluated in terms of damage progression and the evolution of peak force for both collapsed and non-collapsed tubes. Results point out that no significant difference exists in the behaviour of the tubes for which no collapse occurs with test duration. On the contrary, the location of the initiation of collapse influenced the shape of the load and number of impact curves for collapsed tubes. The value of the stiffness after the initiation of collapse remains the same regardless of the magnitude of the applied energy. Furthermore on the collapsed tubes, it was observed that impact energy does not significantly reduce the stiffness of tubes during initial impacts, however, their effects were apparent as the number of impacts increases. ...|$|E

Advantages of helical piles include: short installation time with minimal noise and vibration levels; can be installed with ease in limited accessibility site; and onsite quality control by measurement of installation torque. The main objective of the current research is to assess the performance of steel fibre-reinforced helical pulldown micropiles (RHPM), and fibre-reinforced polymer-steel fibre- reinforced pulldown micropiles (FRP-RHPM) under axial and lateral monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. The research methodology involved conducting full scale field testing on: one plain helical pile, 12 RHPM and 12 FRP-RHPM. Piles were subjected to axial static and one-way cyclic loading, and lateral static and two-way cyclic loading. The axial test results were then used to calibrate a three-dimensional finite element model. To calibrate the lateral test results, moment-rigidity curves for the tested piles were generated through three-dimensional finite element models. Along with test results, these curves were used to calibrate a finite difference model. The experimental investigation under axial loads shows that these pile systems behave as <b>composite</b> <b>pile</b> systems. The grout shaft significantly improves the helical pile axial performance. Cyclic loads resulted in degradation of the shaft resistance, however, resulted in an improvement of the lead section resistance. The overall pile cyclic response was found to stabilize after a few cycles of loading. Finally, the cyclic loading was found to improve the axial capacity of these systems. The experimental investigation under lateral loads shows that the grout shaft and/or the FRP sleeve significantly improve the plain helical pile lateral performance and ductility.

However, when those piles are structurally connected to rafts, relatively high axial stresses develop in relatively small numbers of piles, which are often designed to fully mobilize their geotechnical capacities. To avoid a concentration of stress at the head of piles in a traditional piled raft foundation, the raft is disconnected from the piles, and a cushion is introduced between them. Also, to tackle an unfavourable soil profile for a piled raft foundation, the conventional piled raft has been modified into a cushioned <b>composite</b> <b>piled</b> raft foundation, where piles of different materials are used. In the current study the behavior of cushioned foundation components, which transfer the load from the structure to the subsoil, are analyzed in detail, i. e., the thickness of the raft, the length of a long pile and the modulus of a flexible pile...|$|R

Considering the gravel pile and pile materials with different properties of tension and compression of soil pile {{in the process of}} expansion, the influence of intermediate principal stress to improving the bearing capacity of foundation in the process of expansion, we use the planar axisymmetric double shear unified strength theory and present a gravel pile ultimate bearing capacity of single <b>pile</b> <b>composite</b> foundation unified expression. The theory study of gravel <b>pile</b> <b>composite</b> foundation and engineering practice has a certain guiding significance...|$|R
