40|$|A new genus of Agathidinae (Hymenoptera, Braconidae), Neothlipsis, is {{proposed}} to include 10 species. Nine {{of these species}} were formerly included in the polyphyletic genus Therophilus Wesmael 1837, formerly referred to as Bassus. A new species, Neothlipsis parysae, parasitic on Samea multiplicalis (Guenée), is described. The ten described species transferred to Neothlipsis are:, Neothlipsis agathoides, <b>comb.</b> n. <b>for</b> Bassus agathoides Newton and Sharkey 2000; Neothlipsis agilis, <b>comb.</b> n. <b>for</b> Bassus agilis Cresson 1868; Neothlipsis brevicauda, <b>comb.</b> n. <b>for</b> Bassus brevicaudus Muesebeck 1932; Neothlipsis californica, <b>comb.</b> n. <b>for</b> Bassus californicus Muesebeck 1927; Neothlipsis cincta, <b>comb.</b> n. <b>for</b> Microdus cinctus Cresson 1873; Neothlipsis coleophorae, <b>comb.</b> n. <b>for</b> Bassus coleophorae Rowher 1915; Neothlipsis discolor, <b>comb.</b> n. <b>for</b> Microdus discolor Cresson 1873; Neothlipsis nigricoxa, <b>comb.</b> n. <b>for</b> Microdus nigricoxus Provancher 1886; Neothlipsis petiolate, <b>comb.</b> n. <b>for</b> Bassus petiolatus Muesebeck 1932; Neothlipsis taeniativentris, <b>comb.</b> n. <b>for</b> Microdus taeniativentris Enderlein 1920.

40|$|Flax is an {{important}} crop for oil and fiber, however, no high-density genetic maps have been reported for this species. Specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) is a high-resolution strategy for large scale de novo discovery and genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms. In this study, SLAF-seq was employed to develop SNP markers in an F 2 population to construct a high-density genetic map <b>for</b> <b>flax.</b> In total, 196. 29 million paired-end reads were obtained. The average sequencing depth was 25. 08 in male parent, 32. 17 in the female parent, and 9. 64 in each F 2 progeny. In total, 389, 288 polymorphic SLAFs were detected, from which 260, 380 polymorphic SNPs were developed. After filtering, 4, 638 SNPs were found suitable for genetic map construction. The final genetic map included 4, 145 SNP markers on 15 linkage groups and was 2, 632. 94 cM in length, with an average distance of 0. 64 cM between adjacent markers. To our knowledge, this map is the densest SNP-based genetic map <b>for</b> <b>flax.</b> The SNP markers and genetic map reported in here {{will serve as a}} foundation for the fine mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs), map-based gene cloning and marker assisted selection (MAS) <b>for</b> <b>flax...</b>|$|R
