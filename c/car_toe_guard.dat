When the desert tanker boots came out, it was not authorized to have steel toe inserts for fear that the crewman may have his toe cut off if too much weight was put on the boot.|$|R

50|$|A. J. Foyt's day ended {{just short}} of the midway point. A failed {{transmission}} linkage prevented him from pulling out of the pits. Foyt famously climbed from the cockpit, grabbed a hammer and a screwdriver, and started pounding away at the rear mechanics of the car. His attempts were futile, and the car was wheeled back to the garage area. Foyt revealed, during an interview immediately thereafter, that the Cogan crash had damaged the <b>car's</b> <b>toe</b> in alignment, and that it had been handling poorly all race up to that point. The 1982 race would be the final Indy 500 Foyt would lead during his driving career.|$|R

5000|$|In 1923, after Chuck Taylor made {{improvements}} to the shoe, Converse decided to incorporate his name onto the ankle patches that displayed the Converse All Star logo. Then, in the 1930s Taylor's signature was put into the design, which is how the shoe {{became known as the}} [...] "Chuck Taylor" [...] All Star. When first created, the Converse All Star had three main styles—a monochromatic shoe with a black canvas upper and black rubber soles, an all white shoe with blue and red trim, and an all black leather and rubber shoe. It was not until 1949 that Converse decided to make the <b>toe</b> <b>guard,</b> laces and outer wraps white, which gave the appearance of the iconic black and white Converse All Stars of today. In 1957, Converse came out with the low-cut [...] "Oxford" [...] version of the All Star and soon after started to produce the shoes in multiple colors and prints. Today, Converse makes the Chuck Taylor All Star in a variety of colors, styles, prints and fabrics.|$|R

40|$|Translation begins] U. S. ARMY AIR FORCES MAXWELL FIELD, ALA. Sunday Dear Mom, Another week. One {{more and}} I’ll be an upperclassman. There was a dance last night. Quite an affair. There were about 4000 cadets there and about 200 girls, {{you know one}} of these all-mail affairs! Before the {{so-called}} dance last night I saw “Up In Mabel’s Room,” with Dug. It’s terrific. Funny as hell. Speaking of laughing, here’s a good joke for you: The other day I was driving {{down the street with}} my girl when the car broke down, naturally I got out and got under and started tinkerin’ around. Well after about a half hour of this Dixie Lee, my girl, says “Hon wha’ is yo’all doin dow there?” which means “What are you doing down there?” “Trying to fix this hairy car,” was my angry reply supplemented with, “if you think you can do better, come on down!” So down she came. Well, it was warm that day and there she was lying next to me, close and warm. I guess I got a little ardorous. Presently a cop came up to us and said, “Suh, what is yo’all doin’ under there?” “Fixing the car” I answered. “Well suh, there are three reasons why I’ll say yo ain’t fixin’ yo <b>car,</b> fust yo <b>toes</b> are pointin’ down! Second, there are 300 people watchin’ ya, and third, somebody’s run off with yo car!” You know, these people in Montgomery are very strange. In town the other day I saw a sign that said, “O’Chanessy’s Tool Works. ” I don’t know what the hell the bastard’s braggin’ about, mine does too, but I don’t go puttin’ up signs about it! Well that’s enough of that. Everything is fine here honey. There’s not much news except that it’s hellously hot. I thought about you today on Mother’s Day, and tried to call you, but couldn’t get near a phone. I love you honey. Happy Mother’s Day. Your Son Judd P. S. Enclosed is name tag + cover for S. B. [Postcard] UNITED STATES ARMY AIR FORCES Note change in address Thursday 2100 Dear Mom, Just a short note honey to let you know I’m still pluggin! I’ve no time to write a letter. I’m taking finals in math, A. I., + all the others. Thank Tottie for the Penushe it was swell, everyone loved it. I’ll write her soon. O love you honey. Your Son Judd [Translation ends...|$|R
