5|$|Boyars <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> {{executed}} {{without the}} knowledge and approval of the Transylvanian Prince and, if convicted for treason, their fortunes <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> confiscated. Apparently Michael was displeased with the final form of the treaty negotiated by his envoys, but was forced to comply. Prince Michael said {{in a conversation with}} the Polish envoy Lubieniecki: …they did not proceed as stated in their instructions but as their own good required and obtained privileges for themselves. He would try to avoid the obligations imposed on him {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E
5|$|There {{used to be}} {{two large}} geysers fields in Nevada—Beowawe and Steamboat Springs—but they were {{destroyed}} by the installation of nearby geothermal power plants. At the plants, geothermal drilling reduced the available heat and lowered the local water table {{to the point that}} geyser activity <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> sustained.|$|E
5|$|This {{suggested}} that the single reconstructed arch of the Hurva <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> understood as a satisfactory expression of any commitment to rebuild the lost synagogue nor as an acceptable official response to its intentional destruction in 1948.|$|E

60|$|During {{the hour}} which {{followed}} Walter's capture {{the two men}} remained close at hand, while their horses were allowed to stroll along the path, eating grass, and at the expiration of that time the animals <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> either <b>be</b> seen or heard.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the decade, National Brewing Company, {{squeezed}} by {{high prices}} and increasing competition, <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> afford to <b>be</b> an independent entity.|$|R
5|$|After the Allied {{invasion}} of Sicily (July 1943) and the strategic Soviet {{victory in the}} Battle of Kursk (July–August 1943), Goebbels began {{to recognize that the}} war <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> won. Following the Allied {{invasion of}} Italy and the fall of Mussolini in September, he raised with Hitler the possibility of a separate peace, either with the Soviets or with Britain. Hitler rejected both of these proposals.|$|E
5|$|Goldschmidt's rabbi made {{an appeal}} in The Oregonian for forgiveness. Although Goldschmidt <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> prosecuted for the offense, the Oregon State Bar began an {{investigation}} into the matter. Goldschmidt submitted a Form B resignation, which was received by the bar on May 13, where he says that he is aware {{that he would not be}} eligible for readmission.|$|E
5|$|Himmler began {{developing}} {{the notion of}} a Germanic religion and wanted SS members to leave the church. In early 1936, Heydrich left the Catholic Church. His wife, Lina, had already done so the year before. Heydrich not only felt he <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> a member, but came to consider the church's political power and influence a danger to the state.|$|E

6000|$|The news of {{the verdict}} was communicated the same evening to Lady Anna,--as to whose name there <b>could</b> now <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> any dispute. [...] "I congratulate you, Lady Anna," [...] said the Serjeant, holding her hand, [...] "that {{everything}} {{as far as this}} trial is concerned has gone just as we could wish." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The Concerned Officers' Movement {{was formed}} {{by a group of}} active duty and reserve {{officers}} who <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> continue to <b>be</b> passive, unquestioning agents of military and national policies they found untenable." ...|$|R
5|$|The syntax of verb {{negation}} {{shifted from}} negation particles preceding final verbs to a negation particle following participles; thus, as final verbs <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> negated, their paradigm of negation was filled by particles. For example, Preclassical Mongolian ese irebe 'did not come' vs. modern spoken Khalkha Mongolian ireegüj or irsengüj.|$|E
5|$|Ark Royal and {{the ships}} of Force H {{returned}} to Gibraltar on 29 May 1941. Despite the boost in Allied morale from {{the sinking of}} the battleship Bismarck, the war in the Mediterranean was going against the Allies. Greece and Crete had fallen to the Axis Powers, and the Afrika Korps was preparing to launch a final push into Egypt. Malta remained an important stronghold in the Mediterranean, but was coming under increased pressure from Italian and German air attacks, and <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> supplied from the east since the fall of Crete.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} March {{or early}} in April 1916, the British {{presence}} in the Sinai was growing; 16 miles (26km) of track, including sidings, had been laid. Between 21 March and 11 April, the water sources at Wady Um Muksheib, Moya Harab and Jifjafa along the central Sinai route from southern Palestine were destroyed. In 1915, they had {{been used by the}} central group of about 6,000 or 7,000 Ottoman soldiers who moved across the Sinai Desert to attack the Suez Canal at Ismailia. Without these wells and cisterns, the central route <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> used by large forces.|$|E
60|$|The Emperor's {{orders and}} because of a woman these <b>could</b> now <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> obeyed. If de Marmont had not seen Crystal on the cathedral steps, {{if he had not}} {{followed}} her--if he had not allowed his passion and arrogant self-will to blind him to time and to surroundings--who knows? but the whole map of Europe might yet have been changed.|$|R
5000|$|Campbell took {{advantage}} of being in London to attend a session of the House of Commons, hearing William Wilberforce speak against slavery, followed by Charles James Fox and William Pitt. He describes it vividly in his memoirs forty years later, concluding, [...] "After hearing this debate, I <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> have <b>been</b> content with being 'Moderator of the General Assembly the Church of Scotland'.".|$|R
50|$|Urocitellus is a genus {{of ground}} squirrels. They were {{previously}} believed {{to belong to}} the much larger genus Spermophilus, but DNA sequencing of the cytochrome b gene showed that this group was paraphyletic to the prairie dogs and marmots, and <b>could</b> therefore <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> retained as a single genus. As a result, Urocitellus is now considered as a genus in its own right.|$|R
5|$|The State Secretary and {{assistant}} to Vanhanen, Risto Volanen, said that attacks on schools <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> considered isolated incidents, and that police {{and security forces}} had to approach them with a new perspective {{in the aftermath of}} Kauhajoki. In December 2009, plans were announced to include an emergency SMS system in schools, more emergency exits, and better access to the architectural lay-out of school buildings for police. Each school is to undergo a risk assessment before the implementation of this plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} was unexpected, {{and almost}} certainly began some days {{before it became}} apparent at the surface. The sea floor at the eruption site is 130metres (426ft) below sea level, and at this depth volcanic emissions and explosions would be suppressed, quenched and dissipated by the water pressure and density. Gradually, as repeated flows built up a mound of material that approached sea level, the explosions <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> contained, and activity broke the surface.|$|E
5|$|When the Athenians {{received}} this news, they rapidly changed policy. If Thermopylae <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> defended, then Athenian security <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> guaranteed. By {{the end of}} February, the Athenians had dispatched an embassy, including Philocrates, Demosthenes and Aeschines, to Philip to discuss peace between Athens and Macedon. The embassy had two audiences with Philip, in which each side presented their proposals for {{the terms of the}} peace settlement. The embassy then returned to Athens to present the proposed terms to the Athenian Assembly, along with a Macedonian embassy to Athens, empowered by Philip to finalize an agreement. The Athenians debated the peace treaty in April and tried to propose a common peace in which all Greek states could partake (including Phocis). However, Demosthenes (at this point a strong proponent of peace) persuaded the Assembly that Philip would never agree to such a peace, and that Athens's vulnerable position meant that they {{had little choice but to}} accept Philip's terms. On 23 April, the Athenians made swore to the terms of the treaty which is now known as the Peace of Philocrates in the presence of the Macedonian ambassadors. Amongst the principal terms were that Athens become Philip's ally, and that they forever renounce their claim to Amphipolis.|$|E
60|$|At nightfall {{the tents}} were set on fire; they soon burnt out, {{and the boys}} <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> see what <b>was</b> taking place. Rising from the shelter, they {{walked back to the}} other side of the crest.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} Jimmy had {{a glimpse of}} a wet, white face, and a hand, {{apparently}} clinging to a cranny, and then the flicker of firelight sank and left him in black darkness. He did not understand exactly what had taken place, but it was unpleasantly evident that the fuses would soon reach the powder, while his comrade, whom he <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> see, <b>was</b> apparently unable to ascend the gully.|$|R
50|$|All {{the species}} of Ictidomys were {{previously}} believed {{to belong to}} the much larger genus Spermophilus (I. parvidens as a subspecies of Spermophilus mexicanus), but DNA sequencing of the cytochrome b gene showed that this group was paraphyletic to the prairie dogs and marmots, and <b>could</b> therefore <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> retained as a single genus. As a result, Ictidomys is now considered as a genus in its own right.|$|R
5|$|By 1980, the {{authorities}} {{had no choice}} but to make another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic levels, but they knew that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion. Western bankers providing loans to the Polish government at a meeting at the Bank Handlowy in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that low prices of consumer goods <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> subsidized by the state. The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat. A wave of strikes and factory occupations began at once, with the biggest ones taking place in Lublin in July 1980.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the {{distinguished}} Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson promoted {{the ideas that}} Maya cities were essentially vacant ceremonial centres serving a dispersed population in the forest, and that the Maya civilization was governed by peaceful astronomer-priests. These ideas began to collapse with major advances in the decipherment of the script in the late 20th century, pioneered by Heinrich Berlin, Tatiana Proskouriakoff, and Yuri Knorozov. With breakthroughs in understanding of Maya script since the 1950s, the texts revealed the warlike activities of the Classic Maya kings, and {{the view of the}} Maya as peaceful <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> supported. Detailed settlement surveys of Maya cities revealed the evidence of large populations, putting an end to the vacant ceremonial centre model.|$|E
5|$|On December1, Epsilon began a {{northeast}} motion due to {{an approaching}} trough, {{and the next day}} it attained hurricane status. After turning to the east, it developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, meaning it had a circular eye, a ring of convection, and had few fluctuations in its intensity. On December5 Epsilon attained peak winds of 85mph (140km/h), and the next day it turned to the south and southwest. Late on December7, the winds dropped below hurricane status {{for the first time in}} five days, making Epsilon the longest-lasting December hurricane on record. Stronger wind shear caused rapid weakening, and the storm <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> classified as a tropical cyclone late on December8. The next day the remnant circulation of Epsilon dissipated.|$|E
5000|$|The plot {{suggests}} that many wartime publications of Timely Comics were in fact, in the Marvel Universe, published as propaganda of the US military. Those pulp publications and comic books were portraying the adventures of [...] "real people". Once such persons died, presumably in action, their exploits <b>could</b> obviously <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> published. For this reason many of the early Marvel/Timely characters only appeared once or twice in Timely comic books.|$|R
5000|$|Vampire {{fiction writer}} Anne Rice was another {{faithful}} user of WordStar who struggled {{to have it}} installed on newer computers until it <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> reasonably <b>be</b> done. She then grudgingly transitioned to Microsoft Word, whose design she felt was comparatively unintuitive and illogical: [...] "MS Word was a nightmare by comparison, made perhaps for students and men who liked to 'play' with a mouse. Learning it was like learning something thrown together by maniacs." ...|$|R
60|$|At Kelso Harry {{procured}} {{changes of}} garments, attiring {{himself as a}} Lowland farmer, and his companions as two drovers. They were, as before, mounted; but the costume of English farmers <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> have <b>been</b> supported by any plausible story. They learned that upon the direct road north they should find many bodies of Scotch troops, and therefore made for the coast. Two days' riding {{brought them to the}} little port of Ayton.|$|R
5|$|Restrictions on Jews {{were already}} in place before the invasion, {{including}} a prohibition on marrying Christians. After the invasion, Randolph Braham writes, the Hungarian government immediately began the process of isolating Jews {{from the rest of}} the community. From 5 April Jews over the age of six had to wear a 3.8 x 3.8inch (10 x 10cm) yellow badge. They were forbidden from using telephones, owning cars or radios, travelling or moving home, and had to declare the value of their property. Jewish civil servants, journalists and lawyers were sacked, non-Jews could not work in Jewish households. Books by Jews were removed from libraries and Jewish authors <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> published.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the anarchy in Hungary, Polish troops invaded Lodomeria and Halych in February. Only Vladislaus II of Opole, who claimed the two realms for himself, protested against their action. Sigismund was crowned king on 31March as {{it was decided that}} the kingdom <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> without an effective ruler. One of his supporters, Ivan of Krk, laid siege to Novigrad Castle with the assistance of a Venetian fleet, which was under the command of Giovanni Barbarigo. They captured the castle and liberated Mary on 4June 1387. She was especially grateful to Barbarigo; she knighted him and granted an annuity of 600 golden florins to him.|$|E
5|$|That {{changed at}} midnight on Sunday, 18 March 1944, with the {{invasion}} of Hungary by Nazi Germany, and the arrival in Budapest of SS-Obersturmbannführer Adolf Eichmann to oversee the deportation of the country's Jews. From 5 April Jews {{over the age of}} six had to wear a 10x10cm (3.8x3.8in) yellow badge on the upper-left side of their coats or jackets. Jews had to declare the value of their property, and were forbidden from moving home, travelling, owning cars or radios, listening to foreign radio stations, or using the telephone. Jewish authors <b>could</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> published, their books were removed from libraries, and Jewish civil servants, journalists and lawyers were sacked.|$|E
50|$|A goods {{funicular}} {{was inaugurated}} in 1912 {{to build and}} supply the training area. It went from train station in Kaiseringen to the Alb plateau with a length of 2.4 kilometers. At the end of World War I (1914-1918) the training ground <b>could</b> initially <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> used because of the Treaty of Versailles. This treaty demanded the demilitarization of military proving grounds. The funicular was decommissioned in 1921 and never rebuilt.|$|R
25|$|In 87 AD, when Domitian {{withdrew the}} Legio II Augusta and the {{majority}} of auxiliary units from the Scottish Lowlands for his Dacian war, this region <b>could</b> also <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> held {{due to the lack of}} troops. The northern border of Roman Britain became the Tyne-Solway Firth line, a chain of military camps on the Stanegate road. After 100 AD, the last Roman castra in the lowlands - with one or two exceptions - were abandoned.|$|R
60|$|Lady Madeleine, {{as if it}} <b>could</b> now <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> postponed, {{introduced}} to the two gentlemen her brother, Mr. St. George. This gentleman, who, during the whole previous conversation, had kept {{his head in a}} horizontal position, looking neither to the right nor to the left, and apparently unconscious that any one was conversing with his sister, because, according to the English custom, he was not introduced, now suddenly turned around, and welcomed his acquaintance with cordiality.|$|R
