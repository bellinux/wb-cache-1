5|$|The Philippines' rainforests and its {{extensive}} coastlines {{make it home}} to {{a diverse}} range of birds, plants, animals, and sea creatures. It {{is one of the}} ten most biologically megadiverse countries. Around 1,100 land vertebrate species {{can be found in the}} Philippines including over 100 mammal species and 170 bird species not thought to exist elsewhere. The Philippines has among the highest rates of discovery in the world with sixteen new species of mammals discovered in the last ten years. Because of this, the rate of endemism for the Philippines has risen and likely will continue to rise. Native mammals include the palm <b>civet</b> <b>cat,</b> the dugong, the cloud rat and the Philippine tarsier associated with Bohol.|$|E

500|$|Popular cultivars in Malaysia and Singapore (Singapore imports {{most of its}} durians from Malaysia {{hence the}} {{varieties}} are similar although there may be slight variation in the names) include [...] "D24" [...] which is a popular variety known for its bitter sweet taste; [...] "XO" [...] which has a pale color, thick flesh with a tinge of alcoholic fermentation; [...] "Chook Kiok" [...] (Cantonese meaning: bamboo leg) which has a distinctive yellowish core in the inner stem and [...] "Musang King" [...] ('musang' is the Malay word for <b>civet</b> <b>cat)</b> which is usually the priciest of all cultivars. Musang King {{is known for its}} bright yellow flesh and is almost like a more potent or enhanced version of the D24. This particular variety should be consumed last since it tends to make other durians taste bland in comparison.|$|E
2500|$|It is not {{precisely}} known when China and Ethiopia first made direct contact. The sinologist A.

Ethiopian expert Richard Pankhurst is certain that by the Tang dynasty (618â€“907) [...] "the Chinese were acquainted with {{at least part of}} the Horn of Africa and were trading indirectly if not directly with the Somali coast." [...] From that period onwards, China traded with not only Ethiopia and the Horn, but with the peoples of the Eastern African coast, obtaining elephants' tusks, rhinoceros horns, pearls, the musk of the <b>civet</b> <b>cat,</b> ambergis, and slaves. Starting in the Yuan dynasty the Chinese began to increasingly trade directly with Africans, which is attested not only in contemporary documents, but from archeological finds of Chinese coins and porcelain.|$|E

40|$|Almost {{half of all}} {{patients}} with community-acquired pneumonia have no identifiable aetiological agents. Our research identified a novel Group IIb coronavirus {{as the cause of}} SARS from the lung tissue of a patient who died from the atypical pneumonia in 2003. About 70 % of new emerging infectious agents originate in animals. <b>Civet</b> <b>cats</b> are the most commonly consumed wild game animal meat in winter and we found civet SARScoronavirus in caged <b>civet</b> <b>cats</b> in wild animal markets. However, surveillance of wild and farmed <b>civet</b> <b>cats</b> for this novel coronavirus proved fruitless, suggesting that <b>civet</b> <b>cats</b> are simply amplification hosts and not the true virus reservoir. Since the recently identified Lyssavirus, Nipah and Hendra viruses, which have emerged to cause outbreaks of human disease in the last 10 years, were found in bats, we focused on these animals as possible SARS-coronavirus reservoirs. A novel bat SARS-coronavirus highly similar to the human and civet virus was subsequently discovered. If wild animal surveillance had been performed systematically before 2003, the SARS-like coronavirus group might have been discovered and Hong Kong might have better prepared for the SARS epidemic. One year after the discovery of the SARS-coronavirus, we also found another novel Group IIa coronavirus in a patient with community acquired pneumonia returning from Shenzhen. Continuous vigilance is required in surveillance for emerging infectious diseases. For known microbes such as the influenza A H 5 N 1 strain causing the present pandemics in poultry and other birds, continuous surveillance may identify the strains with pandemic potential in humans. The results of this microbiological surveillance have clearly contributed to the epidemiological control, diagnosis and management of influenza A H 5 N 1 and SARS-coronavirus...|$|R

It {{was declared}} a reserve in 1950 after most of the area had been denuded for cultivation of cloves. It still has high closed forests known as Ngezi forest extending right up to the beach at Vumawimbi. The forest types reported consist of coral bushes and thickets, thick grasses and bushes in the sandy-loam soils and Mtifutifu soils; dominant plant species are: Odyendea zimmermanni (Mjoho), riverine forest of Barringtonia racemosa (Mtomondo), Milicia spp (Mvule), Alexandrian laurel (Mtondoo), Erythropholem spp (Mwavi), Antiarus spp (Mgulele), Chrisalidocarpus pembanus (Mpapindi) and Terminalia catapa (Mkungu), and mangrove forests. Avifauna recorded consists of 27 bird species in the forests, out of which the endemic species are hadada, the African goshawk, the palm-nut vulture, scops owl, the malachite kingfisher and the Pemba white-eye. Other faunal species consist of Pemba flying fox (large fruit-eating bat), the Pemba vervet monkey, the Zanzibar red colobus monkey, hyrax, Pemba blue duiker (an antelope {{about the size of a}} hare), feral pigs (introduced by the Portuguese), the Javan <b>civet</b> <b>cat</b> (introduced by southeast Asian traders for the production of musk) and marsh mongoose (an endemic carnivore).|$|E

60|$|The {{land mammals}} are only seven in number, as follows: 1. The common monkey, Macacus cynomolgus, which {{is found in}} all the Indo-Malayan islands, and has spread from Java through Bali and Lombock to Timor. This species is very {{frequent}} {{on the banks of}} rivers, and may have been conveyed from island to island on trees carried down by floods. 2.

Felis megalotis; a tiger cat, said to be peculiar to Timor, where it exists only in the interior, and is very rare. Its nearest allies are in Java. 4. Cervus timoriensis; a deer, closely allied to the Javan and Moluccan species, if distinct. 5. A wild pig, Sus timoriensis; perhaps the same as some of the Moluccan species. 6. A shrew mouse, Sorex tenuis; supposed to be peculiar to Timor. 7. An Eastern opossum, Cuscus orientalis; found also in the Moluccas, if not a distinct species.|$|E
60|$|Batchian is {{remarkable}} {{as being the}} most eastern point on the globe inhabited {{by any of the}} Quadrumana. A large black baboon-monkey (Cynopithecus nigrescens) is abundant {{in some parts of the}} forest. This animal has bare red callosities, and a rudimentary tail about an inch long--a mere fleshy tubercle, which may be very easily overlooked. It is the same species that is found all over the forests of Celebes, and as none of the other Mammalia of that island extend into Batchian I am inclined to suppose that this species has been accidentally introduced by the roaming Malays, who often carry about with them tame monkeys and other animals. This is rendered more probable by the fact that the animal is not found in Gilolo, which is only separated from Batchian by a very narrow strait. The introduction may have been very recent, as in a fertile and unoccupied island such an animal would multiply rapidly. The only other mammals obtained were an Eastern opossum, which Dr. Gray has described as Cuscus ornatus; the little flying opossum, Belideus ariel; a <b>Civet</b> <b>cat,</b> Viverra zebetha; and nice species of bats, most of the smaller ones being caught in the dusk with my butterfly net as they flew about before the house.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCross-species {{transmission}} can {{often lead to}} deleterious effects in incidental hosts. Parvoviruses have a wide host range and primarily infect members of the order Carnivora. Here we describe juvenile common palm <b>civet</b> <b>cats</b> (Paradoxurus musangus) that {{were brought to the}} Singapore zoo and fell ill while quarantined. The tissues of two individual civets that died tested PCR-positive for parvovirus infection. Phylogenetic analysis revealed this parvovirus strain falls in a basal position to a clade of CPV that have infected dogs in China and Uruguay, suggesting cross-species transmission from domestic to wild animals. Our analysis further identified these viruses as genotype CPV- 2 a that is enzootic in carnivores. The ubiquity of virus infection in multiple tissues suggests this virus is pathogenic to <b>civet</b> <b>cats.</b> Here we document the cross-species transmission from domestic dogs and <b>cats</b> to wild <b>civet</b> populations, highlighting the vulnerability of wildlife to infectious agents in companion animals...|$|R
