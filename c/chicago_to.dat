5|$|On October 14, 1990, United Airlines {{became the}} 777's launch {{customer}} when it placed {{an order for}} 34 Pratt & Whitney-powered aircraft valued at US$11billion with options on an additional 34. The development phase coincided with United's replacement program for its aging DC-10s. United required that the new aircraft be capable of flying three different routes: <b>Chicago</b> <b>to</b> Hawaii, <b>Chicago</b> <b>to</b> Europe, and non-stop from Denver, a hot and high airport, to Hawaii. ETOPS certification was also a priority for United, given the overwater portion of United's Hawaii routes. In January 1993, a team of United developers joined other airline teams and Boeing designers at the Everett factory. The 240 design teams, with up to 40 members each, addressed almost 1,500 design issues with individual aircraft components. The fuselage diameter was increased to suit Cathay Pacific, the baseline model grew longer for All Nippon Airways, and British Airways' input led to added built-in testing and interior flexibility, along with higher operating weight options.|$|E
