5|$|The {{electric}} {{shock of the}} <b>common</b> <b>torpedo</b> can be severe, but is not life-threatening. In classical antiquity, the electrogenic properties of this species led it (and other strongly electric fishes) {{to be used in}} medicine for the treatment of pain and diseases such as gout. For example, the Roman physician Scribonius Largus, in his Compositiones medicae (c. 50 AD), recommended that chronic headaches be treated by the application of a live torpedo to the affected area. The <b>common</b> <b>torpedo</b> is edible, but is little-valued by commercial or artisanal fisheries and is mostly discarded when caught. Because of its shallow-water habits, it may survive being captured and discarded relatively well. It is susceptible to several types of demersal fishing gear, including bottom trawls and trammel nets; fishing activity is heavy within its range but no specific data regarding this species are available. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Data Deficient.

5|$|For {{attack and}} defense, the <b>common</b> <b>torpedo</b> can deliver a strong {{electric}} shock {{of up to}} 200 volts. It is a solitary, nocturnal ambush predator that feeds mainly on bony fishes and crustaceans. This species is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished by yolk and histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females produce litters of up to 28 young every year in late summer or autumn, after a gestation period of 4–8 months; the specifics vary between geographical regions. The common torpedo's shock is painful but otherwise of little danger to humans. Its electrogenic properties led it {{to be used in}} medicine by the ancient Greeks and Romans. In modern times, it has no economic value and is mostly discarded when caught as bycatch in fisheries. The impact of fishing on its population is uncertain, and pending more data the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, the <b>common</b> <b>torpedo</b> {{spends much}} time {{resting on the}} sea floor, often buried in sediment. It is an ambush {{predator}} that pounces onto prey and stuns them with electricity, the process taking {{only a fraction of}} a second. Once the prey is immobilized, it is manipulated to the mouth with motions of the disc, and swallowed whole. Adults feed almost entirely on small benthic bony fishes, including soles, herring, mullet, gobies, goatfishes, porgies, dragonets, and jack mackerels. Large decapod crustaceans are a minor secondary food source, while very rarely skates may be consumed. Juveniles are less exclusively piscivorous than the adults and feed on a variety of invertebrates as well. The most significant prey species differ between seasons and geographic regions. For example, in the Tyrrhenian Sea, juvenile common sole (Solea solea) are by far the most important prey item in autumn and winter, but in spring and summer they become less available and other fishes figure more prominently in the ray's diet. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworm Phyllobothrium lactuca, and the monogeneans Amphibdella paronaperugiae and Amphibdelloides benhassinae.|$|E

50|$|In this case, as in {{the common}} {{use of the term}} in the 19th century, torpedo refers to a device {{sometimes}} rigged as a spar torpedo that would now be considered to be a type of naval mine, not being the self-propelled device (called a locomotive <b>torpedo)</b> <b>common</b> in the 20th century.|$|R
50|$|Though {{this system}} of {{propulsion}} gave the G7a(TI) great speed and endurance - the greatest of any production model German torpedo of World War II - it had the distinct disadvantage of being very noisy and leaving a long wake of bubbles, <b>common</b> to most <b>torpedoes</b> of the period, {{with the exception of}} the Japanese Type 93 and submarine Type 95, which were fuelled by enriched oxygen.

40|$|Acoustic {{scattering}} {{has been}} thoroughly analyzed {{with the use}} of finite element analysis (FEA). The problem at hand is a coupled fluid-structure interaction problem on an unbounded domain, where an object of elastic material is surrounded by fluid. Using physical assumptions, the fluid is described by the wave equation which is transformed to the Helmholtz equation. That is, the frequency domain is considered instead of the time domain. In particular one is interested in the scattered pressure of a plane wave at a far field point. The far field is computed by first computing the near field of the fluid surrounding the object, and integrating this solution together with Green's function to compute the scattered pressure at a far field point. This results in the so-called target strength (TS) of an object. This is done for a series of frequencies in the lower spectrum, such that the TS may be plotted over the frequency spectrum. It will also be possible to plot the TS for a range of different incident plane waves, in addition to measuring the TS for a range of angles around the scatterer. As the domain is unbounded, one must create an artificial boundary in order to use FEA. There exist several methods for ensuring that the outgoing waves are not reflected at this artificial boundary, including the PML method after Bérenger, several absorbing boundary condition operators (ABC-operators) after Enquist and Majda (among others), the use of Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operators and finally the use of so-called infinite elements. A complete presentation of this analysis of acoustic scattering {{with the use of}} infinite elements has been presented by Frank Ihlenburg. The same analysis using isogeometric analysis (IGA), will be presented. An overview of IGA alongside the physical equations will be presented for completeness. A complete program will be developed in MATLAB, and GLview Inova will be used as a supplementary program for post processing. The elastic object at hand is exactly represented by NURBS, and is thus especially suited for IGA. Moreover, {{it has been shown that}} IGA is superior to the FEA when considering spectrum analysis. An extensive analysis of the spherical shell, where the 3 D solution is known, will be presented. First, the eigenvalues for the elastic spherical shell is computed, then the acoustic scattering on a rigid sphere is analyzed and finally the full problem is analyzed where acoustic scattering of an elastic spherical shell is considered. All of this is computed using IGA and compared to the known analytic solutions. The workshop Benchmark Target Strength Simulation (BeTSSi) has been a forum for the problem at hand, where several benchmark object has been analyzed by FEA and other methods. The complexity of these objects varies all the way up to a full submarine including <b>torpedoes.</b> <b>Common</b> for all objects is that no analytic solutions are found. Comparisons using several methods have been presented in the BeTSSi conference, with deviating results. The resulting TS graphs from IGA will be compared to existing methods...|$|R

The cornrnon torpedos from the coast of Senegal are larger and the eggs are heavier than Mediterranean specirnens.

Among the five species of genus Torpedo recorded from the coast of Senegal, the <b>common</b> <b>torpedo,</b> Torpedo torpedo is that most cornrnonly caught in the area. Adult males and fernales studied were over 300 mm and 310 mm total length (TL), respectively, with the largest male and the largest female recorded being 445 mm and 550 mm TL respectively. Size at birth was between 102 and 125 mm TL (mean 112. 12 mm; s. e. m. 5. 58). Weight of eggs ranged frorn 6. 2 to 8. 0 g (rnean: 7. 07; s. e. m. 0. 5). Gestation lasts longer, from 6 to 8 rnonths, than in the Mediterranean specimens. A calculated chernical balance of development based on rnean dry weights of the fully developed fetuses and ripe oocytes was 1. 58 for T. torpedo. This value shows that this torpedinid is not a pure lecithotrophic species, and the role of the rnother during gestation is not negligible.
