40|$|The {{effort to}} achieve in-process {{manufacturing}} process monitoring capabilities that are compliant with industrial implementation constraints {{is leading to}} a continuously growing development of multi-sensor approaches. In this frame, sensor fusion techniques may allow the achievement of required monitoring performances in terms of reliability and robustness to both disturbance factors and changing cutting conditions, and the approach becomes even more attractive when exploitable information is already available on-board, like spindle and axis drive currents and power signals. The paper presents a study aimed at {{dealing with the problem}} of monitoring the condition of the tool by using Multivariate Statistical Process Control (SPC) techniques to extract the relevant information content from multiple current signals acquired from spindle and axis drives. Usage of features that are as far as possible independent from cutting parameters, coupled with adaptive control charting methods, is proposed to cope with non-steady state <b>conditions</b> and <b>signal</b> <b>pattern</b> modification with different dynamics. Both static and adaptive Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based approaches are discussed, for tool breakage detection in milling of hard-to-cut materials...|$|R

40|$|Data roaming in the LTE {{network has}} become popular because {{people want to}} {{continue}} using the same services abroad as in their home network. Hence, the control traffic in the LTE network has increased and it has brought fraudulent activities to the network as a side effect. The traffic in the control-plane {{is based on the}} Diameter protocol, which has prescribed actions that the interfaces must support. A small fraction of the total control traffic contains fraudulent <b>signalling</b> <b>patterns,</b> but the high amount of data in total compels us to use machine learning tools in order to find these rare <b>signalling</b> <b>patterns,</b> such as a denial of service attack against the subscriber or the network, unauthorized modification of charging characteristics, and the location tracking of a user which violates the subscriber's privacy. Some of the fraudulent activities may result in a revenue loss for the service provider. These cases create a need for deeper <b>signalling</b> <b>pattern</b> analysis. This thesis examines the detection of Diameter <b>signalling</b> <b>patterns</b> using recurrent neural networks. The analysis is done with two different datasets: data from the real mobile network which contains typical <b>signalling</b> <b>patterns</b> such as network registration or tracking area updates, and the second dataset contains synthetic roaming scenarios with normal traffic patterns as well as the user targeted denial of service attacks. The objectives of both analyses are to measure how accurately any <b>signalling</b> <b>pattern</b> can be detected using recurrent neural networks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{cellular}} networks, the <b>signal</b> <b>pattern</b> {{reported by}} a mobile terminal {{has been the}} major source for localization. In this paper we show how the <b>signal</b> <b>pattern</b> {{is affected by the}} terminal movement such as the speed and the moving direction in CDMA/WCDMA networks. When the mobile terminal is moving, its <b>signal</b> <b>pattern</b> tends to contain more signals from base stations positioned opposite of the terminal’s moving direction than signals from base stations positioned in the forward. We call this phenomenon “signal dragging”. If the signal dragging prevails, it naturally provides a useful hint for figuring out the movement of a terminal, e. g., direction. We also show that the accuracy of the localization algorithm based on pattern matching varies greatly depending on the terminal movement. Based on these experimental results in commercial networks we suggest the practical data collection procedure, e. g., the war-driving, should consider the terminal movement. Otherwise the use of war-driving data can be harmful. ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. Subcellular Ca 2 � <b>signaling</b> <b>patterns,</b> such as Ca 2 � waves, gradients, and oscillations, are an {{important}} aspect of cell regulation, but the molecular basis for these <b>signaling</b> <b>patterns</b> is not understood. Because Ca 2 � release patterns differ among isoforms of the inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (InsP 3) receptor, the relationship between the distribution of these isoforms and subcellular Ca 2 � <b>signaling</b> <b>patterns</b> in nonpigmented epithelial (NPE) cells was investigated. METHODS. The distributions of the types I, II, and III InsP 3 receptors were determined in NPE cells by immunofluorescence, and subcellular Ca 2 � <b>signaling</b> <b>patterns</b> in these cells were examined by confocal line scanning microscopy. RESULTS. The type I InsP 3 receptor was concentrated at the basal pole of NPE cells, whereas the type III receptor was localized to the apical pole. The type II InsP 3 receptor was not expressed in detectable amounts. Acetylcholine induced increases in Ca 2 � that were mediated by InsP 3, and these Ca 2 � increases began as Ca 2 � waves that were initiated at the apical pole, in the region of the type III InsP 3 receptor. Acetylcholine occasionally induced sustained or repetitive Ca 2 � increases that were prominent at the basal pole, in the region of the type I InsP 3 receptor, but only subtle or absent apically...|$|R
40|$|The multivariate optimal {{fingerprint}} {{method for}} the detection of an externally forced climate change signal in the presence of natural internal variability is extended to the attribution problem. To determine whether a climate change signal which has been detected in observed climate data can be attributed to a particular climate forcing mechanism, or combination of mechanisms, the predicted space-time dependent climate change <b>signal</b> <b>patterns</b> for the candidate climate forcings must be specified. In addition to the <b>signal</b> <b>patterns,</b> the method requires input information on the space-time dependent covariance matrices of the natural climate variability and the predicted <b>signal</b> <b>pattern</b> errors. The detection and attribution problem is treated as a sequence of individual consistency tests applied to all candidate forcing mechanisms, {{as well as to the}} null hypothesis that no climate change has taken place, within the phase space spanned by the predicted climate change patterns. As output the method yields a significance level {{for the detection}} of a climate change signal in the observed data and individual confidence levels for the consistency of the retrieved climate change signal with each of the forcing mechanisms. A statistically significant climate change signal is regarded as consistent with a given forcing mechanism if the statistical confidence level exceeds a given critical value, but is attributed to that forcing only if all other climate change mechanisms are rejected at that confidence level. The analysis is carried out using tensor notation, with a metric given by the natural-variability covariance matrix. This clarifies the relation between the covariant <b>signal</b> <b>patterns</b> and their contravariant fingerprint counterparts. The <b>signal</b> <b>patterns</b> define the vector space in which the climate trajectories are analyzed, while the fingerprints are needed to project the climate trajectories onto this space.
