40|$|In {{petroleum}} industries, metals can {{be exposed}} to contaminants that can cause corrosion. Coating will {{reduce the risk of}} corrosion to the substrate to which it is applied by resisting the movement of moisture and contaminants to the surface which cause the substrate to corrode. Palm olein has the characteristics as <b>coating</b> <b>compound</b> and the ability to prevent or inhibit corrosion. This study is focusing on three main objectives, which are to develop a <b>coating</b> <b>compound</b> from palm olein for oil and gas industry, to study the effects of palm olein as a <b>coating</b> <b>compound</b> in protection against corrosion and to study the adhesion of the <b>coating</b> <b>compound</b> on the surface of material. Formulated <b>coating</b> <b>compound</b> consists of palm olein, diethylenetriamine, epoxy and turpentine. During the formulation process, the mixing was repeatedly done as to obtain the optimum product. The turpentine was added to dilute the compound to a certain viscosity suitable for application on an aluminium plate. Coating process was done on the aluminium plates by using a dip coater to obtain a uniform thickness of the coating, after it was cured in an oven. After about 3 weeks, the sample was taken out from the oven and was let to down cooled and was stored for the corrosion test. Two types of corrosion test were done, which are the weight loss test and polarization test. The corrosive medium used in this work was 1 M HC 1. The optimum composition was formed to be 15 ml palm olein, 4 ml diethylene triamine, 11 ml epoxy and 10 ml turpentine. The result also showed that the scratched surface provided the best adhesion of the <b>coating</b> <b>compound</b> on the metal surface. The scratched surface of the samples had larger surface area, allowing improved wetting of the substrate and in turn improved adhesion.

The current research on non-migratory antiozonant systems for natural rubber follows a tripartite study involving the formulation of a <b>coating</b> <b>compound</b> with static and dynamic ozone testing of the coatings, a review of some commercial in-mould coating techniques and analysis of diffusion of a commercial antiozonant through a coating. An outline of the mixing of Nipol 1312, a low molecular weight nitrile butadiene rubber grade produced by leon Chemicals Inc., with other ingredients to produce a coating composition is also given. Test pieces of the natural rubber substrate were placed in pre-coated mould cavities and cured under compression to achieve covulcanisation between the substrate and the coating. All ozone tests were carried out under standard ASTM DI 149 - 911 D 518 - 91 conditions. Results show that the formulated nitrile rubber <b>coating</b> <b>compound</b> is able to protect natural rubber from ozone attack with no migration of the antiozonant as in classical chemical antiozonant systems. An up to date patent search on in-mould coating techniques and systems was carried out and evaluated in conjunction with some current commercial coating methods. In this overview, more emphasis is laid {{on the nature of}} the coating material which subsequently determines the appropriate coating technique, than on the specific in-mould coating process applied. Post-mould coating work with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) on natural rubber substrate was also assessed. An experimental and theoretical study of the diffusion of the antiozonant N,Isopropyl N-phenyl-pphenylenediamine (IPPD) through a protective coating on a natural rubber substrate is made in the project. This study shows that the protective coating is able to reduce the loss of antiozonant through diffusion while giving the rubber adequate protection from ozone.

The polyols were designated as Alk 28, Alk 40 and Alk 65, in which 28, 40 and 65 represents the percentages of oleic acid in the respective formulations. The physical properties of the polyols such as acid value and hydroxyl value have been determined and the infrared (IR) spectroscopic analysis of the polyols is reported. The polyols were reacted with aromatic isocyanate (toluene 2, 4 -diisocyanate, TDI) to form PUR coatings. The effects of varied NCO/OH ratio and oleic acid content of polyols on physical properties of PUR coatings on mild steel panel were determined. The characterization of PUR coatings carried out by IR spectroscopic analysis and physico-chemical properties such as drying time, pencil hardness, adhesion properties, solvent resistance and corrosion/chemical resistant determination were reported. The coatings obtained from polyol Alk 28, exhibits the best overall properties followed by Alk 40. PUR coatings from Alk 65 were softer. As the NCO/OH ratio of the coatings increased, there were progressive increases in mechanical and anticorrosive properties for all the coatings.
