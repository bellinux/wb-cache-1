500|$|Bush {{expanded}} {{economic sanctions}} on Syria. In early 2007, the Treasury Department, {{acting on a}} June 2005 executive order, froze American bank accounts of Syria's Higher Institute of Applied Science and Technology, Electronics Institute, and National Standards and <b>Calibration</b> <b>Laboratory.</b> Bush's order prohibits Americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread {{weapons of mass destruction}} and being supportive of terrorism. Under separate executive orders signed by Bush in 2004 and later 2007, the Treasury Department froze the assets of two Lebanese and two Syrians, accusing them of activities to [...] "undermine the legitimate political process in Lebanon" [...] in November 2007. Those designated included: Assaad Halim Hardan, a member of Lebanon's parliament and current leader of the Syrian Socialist National Party; Wi'am Wahhab, a former member of Lebanon's government (Minister of the Environment) under Prime Minister Omar Karami (2004–2005); Hafiz Makhluf, a colonel and senior official in the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate and a cousin of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad; and Muhammad Nasif Khayrbik, identified as a close adviser to Assad.|$|E
2500|$|For the United Kingdom, any {{installed}} {{electricity meter}} {{is required to}} accurately record the consumed energy, but it is permitted to under-read by 3.5%, or over-read by 2.5%. [...] Disputed meters are initially verified with a check meter operating alongside the disputed meter. [...] The final resort is for the disputed meter to be fully tested both in the installed location and at a specialist <b>calibration</b> <b>laboratory.</b> [...] Approximately 93% of disputed meters {{are found to be}} operating satisfactorily. [...] A refund of electricity paid for, but not consumed (but not vice versa) will only be made if the laboratory are able to estimate how long the meter has been misregistering. [...] This contrasts with gas meters where if a meter is found to be under reading, it is assumed that it has under read {{for as long as the}} consumer has had a gas supply through it.|$|E
