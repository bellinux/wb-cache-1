5|$|Room of the Ark: {{contains}} {{a painting by}} Giovan Battista Caracciolo (17th century). In 1816, the <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> frescoed by Luigi Ademollo with Noah entering Jerusalem with the Ark.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} hall {{went from}} floor to roof, however in the 16th century a <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> added dividing it into two floors. This also involved changes to the original windows. The hall has a cruck roof with a saddle apex typical of the 14th century.|$|E
5|$|That {{part of the}} {{restoration}} in the Sistine Chapel which has caused the most concern is the ceiling, painted by Michelangelo. The emergence of the brightly coloured Ancestors of Christ from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe. Despite warnings, {{the work on the}} ceiling proceeded and, according to critics such as James Beck, their worst fears were confirmed once the <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> completed.|$|E
50|$|Ceiling height {{contributes}} to the atmosphere; low <b>ceilings</b> <b>are</b> homely, and high <b>ceilings</b> <b>are</b> theatrical. As English <b>ceilings</b> <b>are</b> generally low Muthesius outlines two methods of addressing soundproofing. The first involves inserting mineral wool between the ceiling beams, and the second, producing a shortened form of a double height ceiling. This involves the lower ceiling being constructed independently of, but positioned {{as close as possible}} to, the upper floor-bearing ceiling.|$|R
50|$|Wiring and piping {{installed}} behind traditional plaster or wallboard <b>ceilings</b> <b>is</b> {{extremely difficult}} to modify once the finished <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> in place. Wires must either be fished through hollow spaces in the walls behind the finished ceiling, or the <b>ceiling</b> must <b>be</b> demolished in order for wiring or piping changes to be made.|$|R
5000|$|A Boveda <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> a {{brickwork}} technique where bricks {{are built}} up over {{the walls of a}} room to form a vaulted <b>ceiling</b> that <b>is</b> self-supporting.|$|R
5|$|There is {{absolutely}} no doubt that before the restoration, the whole <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> dirtier, more muted and more monochrome than Michelangelo ever intended, but when images of the frescoes are viewed in their stained and unrestored state the subtle washes and intense definitions, described by Beck and Arguimbau, still make their presence known, giving mass and bulk to the forms.|$|E
5|$|A {{procedure}} {{for dealing with}} omitted decompression stops is described in the US Navy Diving Manual. In principle the procedure allows a diver who is not yet presenting symptoms of decompression sickness, to go back down and complete the omitted decompression, with some extra added {{to deal with the}} bubbles which are assumed to have formed during the period where the decompression <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> violated. Divers who become symptomatic before they can be returned to depth are treated for decompression sickness, and do not attempt the omitted decompression procedure as the risk is considered unacceptable under normal operational circumstances.|$|E
5|$|All Stuka {{units were}} moved to Germany's eastern border in {{preparation}} for the invasion of Poland. On the morning of 15 August 1939, during a mass-formation dive-bombing demonstration for high-ranking commanders of the Luftwaffe at Neuhammer training grounds near Sagan, 13 Ju 87s and 26 crew members were lost when they crashed into the ground almost simultaneously. The planes dived through cloud, expecting to release their practice bombs and pull out of the dive once below the cloud ceiling, unaware that on that particular day the <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> too low and unexpected ground mist formed, leaving them no time {{to pull out of the}} dive.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} six bays by curved and moulded timber brackets, joined by tie rods across the room. A pressed metal <b>ceiling</b> rose <b>is</b> centred within each bay. The <b>ceiling</b> also <b>is</b> lined with beaded boards, running diagonally where the ceiling rakes {{up to the}} collar tie.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} walls are all lined, mostly with wide {{tongue and groove}} beech boards with a single bead. The hallway <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> of wide beech boards, but the remaining <b>ceilings</b> <b>are</b> of later, narrow tongue and groove boards, possibly indicating that the original <b>ceilings</b> <b>were</b> of calico. The attic rooms are lined throughout with narrow tongue and groove boards. The interior {{has a number of}} finishes: the walls of the main rooms and hallway painted or wall-papered (this appears to be quite recent); the attic rooms unpainted; the joinery varnished; and the floors bare.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ceilings</b> <b>are</b> {{classified}} {{according to}} their appearance or construction. A cathedral <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> any tall <b>ceiling</b> area {{similar to those in}} a church. A dropped <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> one in which the finished surface is constructed anywhere from a few inches or centimetres to several feet or a few metres below the structure above it. This may be done for aesthetic purposes, such as achieving a desirable ceiling height; or practical purposes such as acoustic damping or providing a space for HVAC or piping. An inverse of this would be a raised floor. A [...] or barrel-shaped <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> curved or rounded upward, usually for visual or acoustical value, while a coffered <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> divided into a grid of recessed square or octagonal panels, also called a [...] "lacunar ceiling". A cove ceiling uses a curved plaster transition between wall and ceiling; it is named for cove molding, a molding with a concave curve. A stretched ceiling (or stretch ceiling) uses a number of individual panels using material such as PVC fixed to a perimeter rail.|$|R
5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, the upper and lower halves of the tower were divided into two separate areas. The spiral staircase from the ground floor kitchen to the upper floors, holding the records, was removed, and a window on the first floor was turned into a doorway so that the upper floors could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> installed in on the first floor, possibly also in 1753 at a cost of Â£350.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, the USAF {{opened the}} Raptor enhancement, {{development}} and integration (REDI) contract to bidders, with a $16 billion budget. In November 2011, Lockheed Martin's upgrade contract <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> raised to $7.4 billion. Nearly $2 billion was allocated for structural repairs {{and to achieve}} fleet availability rate of 70.6% by 2015. However, only 63% was achieved. Some F-35 technology, such as more durable stealth coatings, have been applied to the F-22. By 2012, the update schedule had slipped seven years due to instability in requirements and funding. In 2014 the USAF moved to cut upgrade funding.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year 1506, Pope Julius {{conceived}} a program to paint {{the ceiling of the}} Sistine Chapel. The walls of the chapel had been decorated twenty years earlier. The lowest of three levels is painted to resemble draped hangings and was (and sometimes still is) hung on special occasions with the set of tapestries designed by Raphael. The middle level contains a complex scheme of frescoes illustrating the Life of Christ on the right side and the Life of Moses on the left side. It was carried out by some of the most renowned Renaissance painters: Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Pinturicchio, Signorelli and Cosimo Rosselli. The upper level of the walls contains the windows, between which are painted pairs of illusionistic niches with representations of the first thirty-two popes. A draft by Matteo d'Amelia indicates that the <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> painted blue like that of the Arena Chapel and decorated with gold stars, possibly representing the zodiacal constellations. It is probable that, because the chapel was the site of regular meetings and Masses of an elite body of officials known as the Papal Chapel who would observe the decorations and interpret their theological and temporal significance, it was Pope Julius' intention and expectation that the iconography of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> to be read with many layers of meaning.|$|E
50|$|Three {{rooms with}} timber {{panelled}} <b>ceilings</b> <b>are</b> {{located on the}} western side of the house. In each room, French doors open out to the verandah on both the southern and northern sides, which, like the eastern side, are enclosed with timber louvres, while the <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> lined with horizontally joined timber.|$|R
50|$|Internal {{walls and}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>are</b> lined with fibrous cement sheeting.|$|R

5|$|The Church of St Cuthbert (which {{tourists}} often {{mistake for}} the cathedral) has a fine Somerset stone tower and a superb carved roof. Originally an Early English building (13th century), {{it was much}} altered in the Perpendicular period (15th century). The nave's coloured <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> repainted in 1963 at the instigation of the then Vicar's wife, Mrs Barnett. Until 1561 the church had a central tower which either collapsed or was removed, and has been replaced with the current tower over the west door. Bells were cast for the tower by Roger Purdy.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the building, with arches, pilasters, garlands and ornaments, which is visible from Beauford Square, was designed by George Dance the Younger who also designed the decorative sections of the interior. The main fabric of the building was by John Palmer, who supervised the construction. The <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> decorated with panels from Fonthill Splendens, a mile from Fonthill Abbey, which were painted by Andrea Casali and donated to the theatre by Paul Cobb Methuen. Because of the potential damage from the gas lights, which were installed in 1827, the paintings were moved by William Blathwayt to Dyrham Park.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} types of wood that have been {{positively}} identified: teak (Tectona grandis) {{was used for the}} through-beams and is resilient to the teredo worm (the Teredinidae family), the <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> made from a Cupressus genus which was possibly Cupressus torulosa, the stem-post is made of rosewood from the Leguminosae family (now called the Fabaceae) and either the Dalbergia or Pterocarpus genus. The wooden box found in the stern area of the shipwreck was made from an Artocarpus genus of the family Moraceae, more commonly known as the Mulberry family.|$|E
25|$|Heating ducts {{are visible}} {{along the top}} of the west wall. The coffered <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> elliptical-arched with lateral beams {{springing}} from the pilaster capitals. The coffers themselves are intricately painted and gilded. In the center of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>are</b> stained glass skylights. The light they let in is supplemented by artificial light from hanging fixtures.|$|R
5000|$|Double timber doors lead to {{a simple}} interior. The {{internal}} walls are tongue and groove, which are painted off-white. The 1960s false <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> constructed of fibro cement sheeting. The original tongue and groove <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> still visible under the sheeting. The hardwood polished floor is constructed from local rainforest timber, [...] "black bean".|$|R
25|$|The {{outer walls}} were stone masonry construction, two feet thick. The inner walls and <b>ceilings</b> <b>were</b> hewn oak logs, {{about a foot}} square. There was about a foot of space between the outside masonry walls and the inside oak walls. This space and the space above the upper <b>ceiling</b> <b>were</b> filled with loose rock to {{discourage}} escape.|$|R
5|$|They were {{supported}} by architects Anatoliy Krushynskyi, Tamara Tselikovska, and Fedir Zaremba, who were responsible for designing the underground vestibule. While the redesign was taking place, construction on the station's original utilitarian design continued. The new design {{was based on the}} form of a Kievan Rus' temple, featuring unique mosaics situated throughout the station. The central hall's height was increased, and the original design's pylons were replaced with much lower columns, finished off with white marble and matte polish. In particular, the white <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> divided with diametrical mosaic stripes with brick grouting on the sides, completed by artists Hryhoriy Korin and Volodymyr Fedko.|$|E
5|$|All {{flights in}} and out of the Cabo San Lucas, La Paz, Los Cabos, and Loreto {{airports}} were cancelled on September15. A terminal roof at the Los Cabos was detached and the <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> partially destroyed. As a result, approximately 3,000-4,000people aboard 44flights were stranded. Although the interior walls of the airport in La Paz sustained damage, the airport resumed normal operations within a week following Odile. Throughout the peninsula, 30,000vacationers were stranded, including 26,000 from other nations, mainly from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Many of the stranded were evacuated to shelters, though one of the shelters collapsed due to overcrowding. By September16, many tourists were airlifted to surrounding airports, including Tijuana, MazatlÃ¡n, Guadalajara, and Mexico City, although one person perished on a flight back via a heart attack due to stress the storm created.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the 63rd Street Line, {{including}} the Lexington Avenueâ63rd Street station, began on November 25, 1969. The station was built {{using a combination}} of cut-and-cover construction and tunneling machines. However, after the construction of the Second Avenue Subway ceased in 1975 due to the city's severe fiscal crisis, the BMT 63rd Street Line side, the northern tracks, basically led to a non-existent subway line, so the BMT side was abandoned and walled off with a temporary orange brick wall, and a false <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> placed on the upper level's IND 63rd Street Line side, the southern side. Finishing touches were only applied to the IND side of the station. The tracks on the closed-off BMT side were used only to store trains outside of rush hour.|$|E
40|$|The Court of Justice accepts {{that cost}} <b>ceilings</b> <b>are</b> {{permissible}} under Article 14 of the Enforcement Directive (2004 / 48 /EC), but does so on certain conditions {{as to how}} those <b>ceilings</b> <b>are</b> set. It also confirms that {{the recovery of the}} cost of technical advisers (experts) should not be restricted to where there is fault...|$|R
50|$|No <b>Ceilings</b> <b>is</b> a mixtape by American rapper Lil Wayne. It was {{scheduled}} to be released on October 31, 2009, but was leaked before the official date. No <b>Ceilings</b> <b>was</b> officially released on October 31 (Halloween), with 4 additional tracks. The mixtape is available as a free and legal download and it generally received positive reviews from critics.|$|R
50|$|The {{outer walls}} were stone masonry construction, two feet thick. The inner walls and <b>ceilings</b> <b>were</b> hewn oak logs, {{about a foot}} square. There was about a foot of space between the outside masonry walls and the inside oak walls. This space and the space above the upper <b>ceiling</b> <b>were</b> filled with loose rock to {{discourage}} escape.|$|R
5|$|However, in 2007, {{construction}} resumed on the Second Avenue Subway, {{and as part}} of the line's construction, the BMT side of {{the station}} would finally be used. The orange wall was removed and replaced by a temporary barrier. Beige-white wall tiles were installed on the station walls adjacent to the tracks. The never-opened entrance at Third Avenue was redesigned with multiple elevators, and the station's false <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> removed. Before Second Avenue Subway service began operating, the temporary walls were removed, revealing the BMT side of the station. On January 1, 2017, {{the first phase of the}} Second Avenue Subway opened, with Q trains, and limited rush hour N trains serving the BMT half of the station. Ridership has increased at the station with the opening of the Third Avenue exit and the introduction of Q service. Many passengers now take advantage of the cross-platform transfer available between the F and the Q.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{were unable}} to enter the silos as OSHA ruled them to be too {{hazardous}} after the explosion. They were only able to access the area after the silos were demolished. By the time this took place, {{four months after the}} disaster, investigators believed that the explosion started in a basement area beneath the silos, from which sugar was fed up to the packaging building on conveyor belts. The factory's outdated construction materials and methods are believed to have contributed to the severity of the blaze. The <b>ceiling</b> <b>was</b> of wooden tongue and groove design. The creosote used throughout was known as âfat lighter,â because of the fire risk it posed. Interviews of Imperial Sugar employees conducted by OSHA uncovered a lack of training, as 40 of the workers reported never receiving training on how to exit the building in an emergency. Only five employees recalled having a fire drill.|$|E
5|$|Kirchherr {{asked the}} Beatles {{if they would}} mind letting her take {{photographs}} {{of them in a}} photo session, which impressed them, as other groups had only snapshots that were taken by friends. The next morning Kirchherr took photographs with a Rolleicord camera, at a fairground in a municipal park called Hamburger Dom which was close to the Reeperbahn, and in the afternoon she took them all (minus Best, who decided not to go) to her mother's house in Altona. Kirchherr's bedroom (which was all in black, including the furniture, with silver foil on the walls and a large tree branch suspended from the <b>ceiling),</b> <b>was</b> decorated especially for Voormann, with whom she had a relationship, although after the visits to the Kaiserkeller their relationship became purely platonic. Kirchherr started dating Sutcliffe, although she always remained a close friend of Voormann.|$|E
50|$|Tin <b>ceilings</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced}} to North America as an affordable {{alternative to the}} exquisite plasterwork used in European homes. They gained popularity in the late 1800s as Americans sought sophisticated interior design. Durable, lightweight and fireproof, tin <b>ceilings</b> <b>were</b> appealing to home and business owners alike as a functionally attractive design element that was readily available.|$|R
40|$|Suspended t-bar <b>ceilings</b> <b>are</b> {{common in}} {{commercial}} buildings. Research {{has found that}} these <b>ceilings</b> <b>are</b> very leaky, and several problems arise from this. If the space above the <b>ceiling</b> <b>is</b> vented to outdoors, the entire building becomes leaky. Furthermore, if the insulation {{is located at the}} ceiling rather than the roof, then the <b>ceiling</b> space will <b>be</b> hot (summer), and if the <b>ceiling</b> space <b>is</b> also vented to outdoors, then the <b>ceiling</b> space will <b>be</b> hot and humid. The thermal and humidity conditions of the ceiling space have important implications for space conditioning loads, building ventilation rates, and indoor relative humidity. Conductive gains through ductwork add to loads, and various forms of uncontrolled air flow readily move air between the ceiling space and the occupied space. These factors should be considered during design and construction of commercial buildings. Best practice: locate the air and thermal boundaries of the building at the roof deck. This approach has many benefits...|$|R
