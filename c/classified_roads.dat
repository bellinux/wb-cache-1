40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to model human brain's cognitive {{process at the}} primary visual cortex to comprehend road sign. The cortical maps in visual cortex have been widely focused in recent research. We propose a visual model that locates road sign in an image and identifies the localized road sign. Gabor wavelets are used to encode visual information and extract features. Self-organizing maps are used to cluster and <b>classify</b> the <b>road</b> sign images. We evaluate the system with various test sets. The experimental results show encouraging recognition hit rates. There are {{quite a number of}} literatures [1]-[13] introducing different approaches to <b>classify</b> <b>road</b> sign, but none has adopted unsupervised approach. This work makes use of two-tier topological maps to recognize road signs. First–tier map, called detecting map, filters out non-road sign images and regions. Second-tier map, called recognizing map, <b>classifies</b> a <b>road</b> sign into appropriate class...|$|R

This route is roughly as follows: Land's End, Bodmin, Okehampton, Tiverton, Taunton, Bridgwater, the M5 Avon Bridge, the M48 Severn Bridge, Monmouth, Hereford, Shrewsbury, Tarporley, St Helens, Preston, Carlisle, Beattock, Carstairs, Whitburn, Falkirk, Stirling, Crieff, Kenmore, Dalchalloch, A9, Inverness, Kessock Bridge, Cromarty Bridge, Dornoch Firth Bridge, Latheron, Wick, John o' Groats.|$|E
