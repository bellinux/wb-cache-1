Finally, they contended that, although the days had been unusually warm and wild boars were known to inhabit the area, Baker's body showed no obvious signs of decomposition or disturbance by animals, as might have been expected had it been there for six days, as the prosecution had charged.|$|E
5|$|The Utah beach landings, however, were {{relatively}} uncontested, with assault units landing on largely unoccupied beaches and experiencing far less action than the landings at Omaha. The filmmakers chose {{to begin the}} narrative with a depiction of the more dramatic story of Omaha, despite the strategic inaccuracy of an impossible mission that <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> pursued from the other beach area. In addition, {{one of the most}} notable of the operational flaws is the depiction of the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich as the adversary during the fictional Battle of Ramelle. The 2nd SS was not engaged in Normandy until July, and then at Caen against the British and Canadians, 100 miles east. Furthermore, the Merderet River bridges were not an objective of the 101st Airborne Division but of the 82nd Airborne Division, part of Mission Boston.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} hoplites is {{accepted}} as reasonable (and possible); the Athenians alone had fielded 10,000 hoplites at the Battle of Marathon. Some historians {{have accepted the}} number of light troops and used them as a population census of Greece at the time. Certainly these numbers are theoretically possible. Athens, for instance, allegedly fielded a fleet of 180 triremes at Salamis, manned by approximately 36,000 rowers and fighters. Thus 69,500 light troops <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sent to Plataea. Nevertheless, the number of light troops is often rejected as exaggerated, especially {{in view of the}} ratio of seven helots to one Spartiate. For instance, Lazenby accepts that hoplites from other Greek cities might have been accompanied by one lightly armoured retainer each, but rejects the number of seven helots per Spartiate. He further speculates that each Spartiate was accompanied by one armed helot, and that the remaining helots were employed in the logistical effort, transporting food for the army. Both Lazenby and Holland deem the lightly armed troops, whatever their number, as essentially irrelevant to the outcome of battle.|$|E
5|$|Woods had a poor showing at the 2013 U.S Open as {{a result}} of an elbow injury {{sustained}} at The Players Championship. In finishing at 13-over-par, he recorded his worst score ever as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner Justin Rose. After a prolonged break because of the injury, during which he missed the Greenbrier Classic and his own AT National, he returned at the Open Championship at Muirfield. Despite being in contention all week and beginning the final round only two strokes behind Lee Westwood, he struggled with the speed of the greens and could only manage a 3-over-par 74 that left him tied for 6th place, five strokes behind eventual winner Phil Mickelson. Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15-year history. His second round 61 matched his record score on the PGA Tour and <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes. This gave him a seven stroke lead that he held onto for the rest of the tournament. Woods would never contend at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club and would come short of winning a major for the 5th full season, only contending in two of the four majors in 2013.|$|E

25|$|Poirot is less active {{during the}} cases that {{take place at the}} end of his career. Beginning with Three Act Tragedy (1934), Christie had perfected during the inter-war years a subgenre of Poirot novel in which the detective himself spent much of the first third of the novel on the {{periphery}} of events. In novels such as Taken at the Flood, After the Funeral, and Hickory Dickory Dock, he is even less in evidence, frequently passing the duties of main interviewing detective to a subsidiary character. In Cat Among the Pigeons, Poirot's entrance is so late as to be almost an afterthought. Whether this was a reflection of his age or of Christie's distaste for him, is impossible to assess. Crooked House (1949) and Ordeal by Innocence (1957), which <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Poirot novels, represent a logical endpoint of the general diminution of his presence in such works.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{also changed}} the court rules on the {{submission}} of evidence. The Civil Justice Review {{found that many}} cases which <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> settled before the hearings in court were not, primarily {{because there was no}} way of assessing the strength of the other side's arguments and their evidence. The Civil Justice Review suggested that forcing parties to provide evidence and witness statements to the other side before the case came to court would make this assessment easier, and would lead to the parties settling their case before it came to court if one side was at an obvious disadvantage. This suggestion was accepted, and included in the Act, which says that each party must produce written statements of any oral evidence they intend to present in court, and that these statements should be given to the other party before the case comes to court. Any party who fails to comply with this may be refused leave to present this oral evidence in court. A similar system had been used in the Chancery Division, Admiralty Court and Commercial Court since 1986.|$|E
25|$|The {{spending}} saw a good return, with Chelsea finishing as Premiership runners-up (their best league finish for 49 years) {{and reaching}} the Champions League semi-finals after dramatically beating Arsenal in the quarter-finals. But Ranieri {{may have been}} sacked because of some bizarre tactical decisions in the semi-final loss against Monaco (for example, switching central midfielder Scott Parker to right-back and right-back Glen Johnson to centre-back to accommodate more attackers in the team) and for ending the season trophyless. Nevertheless, Ranieri was given a hero's send-off in his final match in charge. That match also gave Chelsea fans {{a glimpse of what}} <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> if not for Abramovich's takeover, as Chelsea handily beat Leeds United, who were relegated, managerless, virtually bankrupt and seemingly destined for oblivion. In Ranieri's place, Abramovich recruited José Mourinho (who had lifted two Portuguese league titles, a Portuguese Cup, a Champions League title and a UEFA Cup with Porto) as the club's new manager. Abramovich also brought legendary Dutch scout Piet de Visser, who scouted Ronaldo and Romário for PSV, and {{is considered one of the}} greatest scouts in history.|$|E

At the time, the Arabian industry had {{little interest in}} western disciplines, so Varian competed with her horses in English riding classes.

Michael Sheen reprised his role as Tony Blair from The Deal, and Helen Mirren played Elizabeth. The film was produced by Granada in co-operation with the ITV network, and {{was released}} in late 2006 to critical acclaim. In 2007, it won the BAFTA Award for Best Film and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

He also said that the song was [...] "the most dated piece on the record... <b>could</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> left off with little to no effect" [...] on the album. In a 2009 review, Alex Young of Consequence of Sound grouped it with the [...] "major clunkers" [...] on Sgt. Pepper. Conversely, Ian Inglis considers the song to be [...] "absolutely central to the form and content" [...] of its parent album, and Ian MacDonald views it as the [...] "conscience" [...] of Sgt. Pepper and [...] "the necessary sermon that comes with the community singing". Musicologist Russell Reising writes that Harrison's song provides the exception on Sgt. Pepper, where the Beatles otherwise [...] "retreated lyrically into predominantly banal, occasionally schmaltzy, and often trivial vignettes". Author and critic Kenneth Womack terms it [...] "quite arguably, the album's ethical soul".|$|E
