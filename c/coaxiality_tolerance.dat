40|$|The {{standards}} and methods concerning assignment of rolling bearing fit with shafts and frames via example of bearing 6 - 208 are analyzed. We set certain differences of recommendations according to GOST 3325 - 85, "Rolling bearings. Tolerance zones and technical requirements to mounting surfaces of shafts and frames. Attachment" and by reference of rolling bearing manufacturers. The following factors {{should be taken}} into consideration when assigning the mounting with the tension the internal ring of the bearing with shaft and mounting with a gap in the outer ring with a housing bore. The methods of achieving accuracy of mounting surfaces of shafts and frames via form tolerance assignment: roundness tolerance, profile of longitudinal cut, cross section, cylindricity and others. It is possible to limit the bearing rings in different ways, for example appointing the cylindrical mounting surfaces and bead end surfaces the appropriate tolerances, namely: <b>coaxiality</b> <b>tolerance</b> or full radial beat of mounting surfaces, and also perpendicularity tolerance, butt beats and full butt beats of mounting end surfaces. We suggest to expand methods of achieving the accuracy of shafts and frames depending on seriation of production and production operations metrology support. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effects of}} geometric tolerances on the rotating shafts natural frequencies. Due to modeling the tolerances, a code is written in MATLAB 2013 software that produces deviated points. Deviated points are controlled by different geometric tolerances, including cylindricity, total run-out and <b>coaxiality</b> <b>tolerances.</b> Final surfaces and models passing through the points are created using SolidWorks 2013 software and finally modal analysis is carried out with the FE software. It is observed whatever the natural frequency is higher or the geometric tolerances are greater, the real and ideal shafts natural frequencies are more distant. Also difference percentage between ideal and real frequencies is investigated. The {{results show that the}} percentage value is approximately constant for every mode shapes...|$|R
