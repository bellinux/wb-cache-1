40|$|The {{development}} of advanced breeding lines and cultivars of perennial fruit crops, {{such as the}} avocado, by conventional plant breeding methods has been a slow process for several reasons: (1) trees have long juvenile periods, usually three to twenty years, depending on the species, (2) <b>controlled</b> <b>pollinations</b> {{are very difficult to}} achieve with many fruit trees, (3) post pollination fruit drop is often excessive, (4) most trees are genetically heterogeneous, and (5) many years are required in order to evaluate progeny from <b>controlled</b> <b>pollinations.</b> In recent years, biotechnology has rapidly impacted breeding programs of many horticultural crops; however, breeding objectives of perennial fruit crops have only just begun to be addressed. In this review, we will attempt to demonstrate the potential of biotechnology for improving avocado...|$|R
50|$|Up {{until the}} 19th Century, rose {{hybridisation}} was a spontaneous occurrence, mediated by pollinating insects such as bees, or self-pollination. Deliberate, <b>controlled</b> <b>pollination</b> of roses {{to create new}} varieties was first systematically practised by Empress Josephine's horticulturalist, Andre Dupont, in the early 1800s. Still, <b>controlled</b> <b>pollination</b> was practised by very few people before Bennett began hybridising roses, inspired by his knowledge of cattle breeding. The laws of genetic inheritance were largely unknown at the time, as Gregor Mendel's pioneering work in genetics were not widely disseminated until {{the turn of the}} 20th Century.|$|E

50|$|In {{agriculture}} and gardening, a beneficial organism is any organism that benefits the growing process, including insects, arachnids, other animals, plants, bacteria, fungi, viruses, and nematodes. Benefits include pest <b>control,</b> <b>pollination,</b> {{and maintenance of}} soil health. The opposite of beneficial organisms are pests, which are organisms deemed detrimental to the growing process.|$|R
40|$|Eucalyptus nitens (Deane & Maiden) Maiden {{has been}} {{extensively}} introduced to the island of Tasmania for plantation purposes. Natural hybridisation with two native species has already been confirmed and this study aimed to determine which other Tasmanian native species could potentially hybridise with E. nitens. <b>Controlled</b> and supplementary <b>pollinations</b> with E. nitens pollen were undertaken on all Tasmanian native species that are potentially at risk of exotic gene flow and hence genetic pollution. Across the seven species tested by using <b>controlled</b> <b>pollinations,</b> seed set per flower, following E. nitens pollinations, was significantly less than for intraspecific outcross pollinations. No significant differences were evident {{in the percentage of}} seed that germinated or the percentage of germinants that grew into healthy seedlings in the glasshouse. Hybridity was verified by morphometric analyses and F- 1 hybrid seedlings were clearly differentiated from parental species and generally intermediate in morphology. Supplementary E. nitens pollination of open-pollinated native flowers was conducted to simulate natural pollination where pollen competition would occur. Seven of the fifteen species tested produced F- 1 hybrids in this case; however, further crossing is required to verify failed cross combinations. Although E. nitens can potentially hybridise with many native species, the results from both supplementary and <b>controlled</b> <b>pollinations</b> suggest the presence of post-pollination barriers of varying strength that need to be considered in assessing the risk of exotic gene flow from plantations...|$|R

50|$|Modern {{hybridization}} {{of roses}} through artificial, <b>controlled</b> <b>pollination</b> began with Josephine’s horticulturalist Andre Dupont. Prior to this, most new rose cultivars were spontaneous mutations or accidental, bee-induced hybrids, and appeared rarely. With <b>controlled</b> <b>pollination,</b> {{the appearance of}} new cultivars grew exponentially. Of the roughly 200 types of roses known to Josephine, Dupont had created 25 while in her employ. Subsequent French hybridizers created over 1000 new rose cultivars in the 30 years following Josephine's death. In 1910, less than 100 years after her death, there were about 8000 rose types in Gravereaux's garden. Bechtel also feels that the popularity of roses as garden plants was boosted by Josephine’s patronage. She was a popular ruler and fashionable people copied her.|$|E

30|$|Assays {{were carried}} out in the Huillilemu seed orchard, {{following}} the method described by Ruiz-Zapata and Arroyo (1978) and Riveros et al. (1995), to determine {{the presence or absence of}} autogamy, allogamy and/or agamospermy. A sample consisted of six N. alpina individuals. For each assay, branches containing from 10 to 84 inflorescences were used.

40|$|A {{breeding}} {{program has}} been developed since 1994 (done by Dr A.

These <b>controlled</b> <b>pollinations</b> have produced a population of new genotypes presented a wide genetic diversity which was very interesting for choice of future selections. The study was undertaken to obtain further information on morphological characters of inflorescence and phonological stages on some new olive selections obtained through self and free pollination of Chemlali Sfax. The impact of climatic conditions on the initiation date and the duration of bud break and full bloom was also investigated. Morphological characteristics of inflorescences showed a comparative variability between descendants within both type of pollination confirmed by higher variation coefficients (CV> 20 %) and significant differences (p ≤ 0. 001). Inflorescence length varied from 11. 14 to 30. 36 mm. Number of flowers per inflorescence was between 7. 11 and 21. 53. Percentage of perfect flowers ranged from 31 % to 95 %. Variability was also observed among olive descendants within crossings on the timing of phonological phase.

5|$|Insect ecology is the {{scientific}} study of how insects, individually or as a community, interact with the surrounding environment or ecosystem. Insects play {{one of the most important}} roles in their ecosystems, which includes many roles, such as soil turning and aeration, dung burial, pest <b>control,</b> <b>pollination</b> and wildlife nutrition. An example is the beetles, which are scavengers that feed on dead animals and fallen trees and thereby recycle biological materials into forms found useful by other organisms.

50|$|In France, Bennett was {{surprised}} to find that the masters of rose hybridisation did not practice deliberate hybridisation through <b>controlled</b> <b>pollination,</b> but rather raised the seeds resulting from natural pollination, which meant that while the seed parent might be known, the pollen parent never was. He also saw that he was fighting an uphill battle with the cool damp English climate, which did not provide enough summer heat to ripen rose hips.|$|E
50|$|Crossing two genetically {{different}} plants {{produces a}} hybrid seed.

5000|$|A second use of {{the term}} [...] "open {{pollination}}" [...] refers to pollination by insects, birds, wind, or other natural mechanisms. This can be contrasted with cleistogamy, closed pollination, {{which is one of the}} many types of self pollination. When used in this sense, open pollination may contrast with <b>controlled</b> <b>pollination,</b> a procedure used to ensure that all seeds of a crop are descended from parents with known traits, and are therefore more likely to have the desired traits.|$|E
50|$|After {{the work}} of Beirnaert and Vanderweyen (1941), it became {{feasible}} to monitor the efficacy of <b>controlled</b> <b>pollination.</b> From 1963 until {{the introduction of the}} palm-pollinating weevil Elaeidobius kamerunicus in 1982, contamination in Malaysia's commercial plantings was generally low. Thrips, the main pollinating agent at that time, apparently rarely gained access to bagged female inflorescences. However, E. kamerunicus is much more persistent, and after it was introduced, Deli dura contamination became a significant problem. This problem apparently persisted for much of the 1980s, but in a 1991 comparison of seed sources, contamination had been reduced to below 2%, indicating control had been restored.|$|E
50|$|Hybrid pollination, {{a type of}} <b>controlled</b> <b>pollination</b> {{in which}} the pollen comes from a {{different}} strain (or species), {{can be used to}} increase crop suitability, especially through heterosis. The resulting hybrid strain can sometimes be inbred and selected for desired traits until a strain that breeds true by open pollination is achieved. The result is referred to as a inbred hybrid strain. To add some confusion, the term hybrid inbred applies to hybrids that are made from selected inbred lines that have certain desired characteristics (see inbreeding). The latter type of hybrid is sometimes designated F1 hybrid, i.e. the first hybrid (filial) generation whose parents were (different) inbred lines.|$|E

30|$|Preliminary {{efforts in}} {{constructing}} controlled cross progenies were unsuccessful.

Other possible explanations exist, however, e.g., the pistillate flowers may have been past receptivity (<b>control</b> <b>pollinations</b> were not made at the same time), or other issues precluded function.

50|$|Turnera hermannioides is a distylous, diploid {{perennial}} {{restricted to}} open, sandy sites in northeastern Brazil. Four populations sampled in Sergipe contained equal proportions of long- and short-styled plants. The style and stamen dimorphism in floral morphs {{is associated with}} differences in pollen size and pollen production. In contrast, flower size, ovule number, and seed fertility of the morphs are not significantly different. A <b>controlled</b> <b>pollination</b> program demonstrated that individuals of T. hermannioides possess a self- and intra-morph incompatibility system. The only pollinations resulting in significant seed production were between the floral morphs. Populations of T. hermannioides grow intermingled with T. ulmifolia, a widespread polymorphic complex containing forms that resemble T. hermannioides. A crossing program between T. hermannioides and diploid and tetraploid varieties of T. ulmifolia revealed barriers to hybridization particularly in crosses at the diploid level. It is concluded that T. hermannioides is a restricted diploid species that is reproductively isolated from T. ulmifolia.|$|E
50|$|Maypan is an F1 hybrid {{coconut palm}} that was {{developed}} by the Research Department of the Coconut Industry Board of Jamaica to be resistant to Lethal Yellowing disease. It was created experimentally in 1962 by cross pollinating two varieties of Cocos nucifera and, after extensive disease exposure and yield performance trials, was named and released in 1974 when a suitable method of mass <b>controlled</b> <b>pollination</b> had been devised. A DwarfxTall hybrid, the Malayan Dwarf seed parents, grown in an isolated seed garden and kept constantly emasculated, are regularly pollinated by blowing a mixture of talc and pollen collected from selected palms of a variety known locally as Panama Tall. This combination gives the Maypan an LY disease resistance approaching that of the Malayan Dwarf and much of the windstorm tolerance of the Panama Tall. It grows to approximately 18 meters in height. The LY resistance of the Maypan, of both of its parents, and of other coconut varieties generally, has been called into question since the 1990s but Maypan, and F1 hybrids using the same types of parents, are still the planting material of choice in the Caribbean and Latin American countries where LY occurs.|$|E
