The results indicated that due to the substrate diffusion resistance the <b>cross-linking</b> <b>immobilization</b> has lowered the accessibility of substrate to the immobilized enzyme’s active site, which had decreased the affinity of protease. It is also to be noticed, as mentioned earlier, that the optimum pH for CLEA-protease and free protease were 6.8 and 8, respectively, this {{had an effect on}} the different performances of the two forms of enzyme. Nevertheless, these findings could be linked to the behaviour of the two enzymes (CLEA and free) in any application at neutral pH.|$|E
40|$|The {{biosensor}} {{provided a}} new and alternative tool for pesticides analysis that is sensitive, fast and inexpensive compared to the conventional methods for determination of carbamate pesticide using amperometric butyryicholinesterase (BChE) biosensor. In this study, {{the objective is to}} immobilize butyrylcholinesterase enzyme (BChE) based on chitosan (CHIT) onto glassy carbon electrode (GCE) through <b>cross-linking</b> <b>immobilization</b> method. The BChE biosensor was fabricated by firstly depositing CHIT film on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and then attaching BChE on CHIT film using glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent. CHIT was selected as BCHE immobilization matrix due to its excellent mechanical strength and biocompatibility. The methylene blue was used as a redox mediator that shuttle electron transfer in BChE biosensor. Optimal conditions were pH 7, scan rate of 0. 03 V and 10 s for BChE/CHIT/GCEto determine peak response of carbaryl inhibition in 0. 2 M PBS- 0. 1 M KCI solution in the presence of 0. 4 mM BTCI as substrate. The inhibition of carbaryl as one of carbamate compound that has high toxicity showed a decline in response of peak current BChE/CHIT/GCE by reducing the immobilized BChE activity and thiocholine products. The lowest detection limit of carbaryl on BChE/CHIT/GCEw as 10 x 1011 ng/ml...|$|E
30|$|Here, we have {{prepared}} functionalized {{gold and silver}} nanoparticles for the immobilizations of TbADH and its cofactor NADPH. The aim was to study the effect of different preparations (physical, covalent, and <b>cross-linking</b> <b>immobilizations)</b> on enzyme activity and structure. Size of the nanoparticles {{and structure of the}} enzyme before and after their interaction were characterized by TEM, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopies. Cofactor binding, activity measurements, storage stability, and ability of the nanoparticle-immobilized TbADH-NADPH bioconjugates to synthesize chiral alcohols with high enantioselectivity using 7 -hydroxy- 2 -tetralone as substrate were also studied.|$|R

This is achieved by suppressing the tendency of the enzyme towards unfolding and is accompanied by the loss of tertiary structure necessary for the activity.|$|R
40|$|Transglutaminase (TGase) was {{cross-linked}} with glutaraldehyde, and cross-linked crystalline transglutaminase was {{immobilized on}} a polypropylene microporous membrane by UV-induced grafting. Immobilized enzyme activity were calculated to be 0. 128 U/cm 2 polypropylene microporous membrane. The microstructure and enzyme characteristics of free, cross-linked and immobilized transglutaminase were compared. The optimum temperature of free transglutaminase {{was determined to}} be approximately 40 °C, while <b>cross-linking</b> and <b>immobilization</b> resulted in an increase to approximately 45 °C and 50 °C. At 60 °C, immobilized, cross-linked and free transglutaminase retained 91. 7 ± 1. 20 %, 63. 2 ± 1. 05 % and 37. 9 ± 0. 98 % maximum activity, respectively.

30|$|Here, {{we report}} the {{development}} of a new polyacrylamide (PAAm)/starch nanofibers’ blend system and highlight its potential as substrate for efficient enzyme immobilization. PAAm was synthesized and blended with starch. The final blend was then electrospun into nanofibers. The response surface methodology was used to analyze the parameters that control nanofiber’s diameter. Electrospun mat was then modified either by <b>cross-linking</b> or phytase <b>immobilization</b> using silane coupling agent and glutaraldehyde chemistry. Physico-chemical properties of blends were investigated using spectroscopic and thermal studies. The evaluation of immobilized enzyme kinetics on both pure and the starch blended PAAm nanofibers was performed using Michaelis–Menten kinetic curves. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results along with differential scanning and X-ray diffraction confirmed that blending was successfully accomplished. TGA analysis also demonstrated that the presence of starch enhances the thermal degradability of PAAm nanofibers. Finally, it was shown that addition of starch to PAAm increases the efficacies of enzyme loading and, therefore, significantly enhances the activity as well as kinetics of the immobilized enzyme on electrospun blend mats.|$|R
40|$|Immobilization of {{humic acid}} (HA) on {{chitosan}} {{has been done}} by using a protected cross-linking reaction method and the product was then utilized as sorbent for Pb(II), Cd(II), and Cr(III). HA was cross-linked with chitosan by using glutaraldehyde in order to obtain sorbent insoluble in aqueous acidic and basic solution. Protection of the active sites of HA was carried out by interacting HA with Pb(II) before performing the cross-lingking reaction in order to maintain its adsorption capacity The result showed that the amount of immobilized HA on chitosan was 99. 7 % by weight. The solubility of the immobilized HA were < 0. 5 % at pH 6 and < 1. 0 % at pH 12. The amount of immobilized HA and its solubility indicated that the protection pretreatment did not interfere the cross-linking reaction between HA and chitosan. The adsorption capacity of the sorbent for Pb(II), Cd(II), and Cr(III) were 416. 7 mg/g, 332. 3 mg/g, dan 714. 3 mg/g, respectively.   Keywords: <b>immobilization,</b> <b>cross-linking,</b> humic acid, chitosan, sorben...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} between H 1 and H 2, the two polypeptides comprising the human asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R), were investigated by immunofluorescence and lateral mobility measurements combined with antibody-mediated <b>cross-linking</b> and <b>immobilization.</b> Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed two ASGP-R populations {{on the cell}} surface, one homogeneously distributed {{and the other in}} micropatches. This was observed both in stably transfected NIH 3 T 3 lines expressing H 1 and/or H 2, and in the human hepatoma cell line HepG 2. In transfected cells expressing both polypeptides (the 1 - 7 - 1 line), H 1 and H 2 were colocalized in the same micro aggregates. Moreover, enhancement of the patching of, e. g., H 1 by IgG-mediated crosslinking was accompanied by copatching of H 2. To quantify H 1 -H 2 complex formation, the lateral diffusion of H 1 and H 2 was measured at 12 degrees C (to avoid internalization) by fluorescence photobleaching recovery. H 1 (or H 2) was immobilized by crosslinking with specific IgG molecules; the other chain was labeled with fluorescent monovalent Fab' fragments, and is lateral mobility was measured. In HepG 2 cells, immobilization of either H 1 or H 2 led to an equal immobilization of the other, indicating that all the mobile H 1 and H 2 are in stable heterooligomers. In 1 - 7 - 1 cells, immobilization of H 2 immobilized H 1 to the same degree, but immobilization of H 1 reduced the mobile fraction of H 2 only by 2 / 3. Thus, in 1 - 7 - 1 cells all surface H 1 molecules are associated with H 2, but 1 / 3 of the H 2 population is independent of H 1. From these data and from measurements of the relative surface densities of H 1 and H 2, conclusions are drawn regarding the oligomeric structure and stoichiometry of the ASGP-R...|$|R
40|$|Hydrophobic polycations {{have been}} shown to {{completely}} kill bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens, on-contact. Herein we describe advances with this technology on two fronts: (1) innovation of a polycationic-derivative that simplifies the labor-intensive covalent-immobilization procedure, and (2) elucidation of the current mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon. First, we developed and characterized a novel polycationic polymer capable of crosslinking to cotton via activation with ultraviolet light. The resultant, covalently-immobilized, Nalkyl polyethylenimine (PEI) demonstrates complete bactericidal activity against S. aureus and E. coli (i. e., representative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively). In addition, by utilizing light to activate the covalent <b>cross-linking,</b> this <b>immobilization</b> procedure is simpler and more versatile than similar chemically-attached bactericidal polycations. Second, we shed light onto how the coating inactivates microbial pathogens. Gramnegative and Gram-positive bacteria exposed to the polycationic coating revealed substantial structural deformation, which allowed for the leakage of their intracellular contents. Characterization of the enzymes leaked into solution from Gram-negative bacteria indicated a disproportionately greater damage done to the outer-membrane than the inner-membrane. In addition, the quantity of proteins leaked into solution showed striking similarity to results obtained from bacteria subjected to lysozyme/EDTA treatment (i. e., a traditional cell lysis technique that degrades the cellular wall). In total, these results suggest that it is this interaction between the polycation and cellular structure (i. e., outer membrane and cell wall) that ultimately compromises bacterial integrity. Expanding our investigation, we studied the effect of the polycationic coating on another membrane-enclosed microbe: the influenza virus. We found that the viral particles adhere to the polycationic coating, which results in a structural deformation, similar to that borne-out by bacteria. As a consequence, viral genomic material is leaked into solution, revealing the viruses' state of inactivation upon adherence to the coating. by Bryan Boen Hsu. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|International audienceA highly {{sensitive}} conductometric biosensor for l-arginine determination {{was developed by}} exploiting the unique biorecognition capacities of two enzymes of urea cycle - arginase (E. C. 3. 5. 3. 1) and urease (E. C. 3. 5. 1. 5). The enzymes were co-immobilized in a single bioselective membrane on the working sensor, while a lysine rich bovine serum albumin (BSA) membrane was immobilized on the reference sensor, allowing differential measurements. The optimum percentage ratio of arginase and urease within the bioselective membrane was determined when the biosensor sensitivity to l-arginine and urea was optimum. Analytical characteristics of the conductometric biosensor for l-arginine determination were compared for two types of enzyme <b>immobilization</b> (<b>cross-linking</b> with glutaraldehyde (GA) and entrapment in the polymeric membrane). The optimum features {{in terms of the}} sensitivity, the linear range, and the detection limit (4. 2 μS/mM, 0. 01 - 4 mM, and 5. 0 × 10 (- 7) M, respectively) were found for l-arginine biosensor based on enzyme cross-linking with GA. A quantitative determination of l-arginine in the real sample (a drinkable solution "Arginine Veyron") gave a satisfactory result compared to the data provided by the producer (a relative error was 4. 6 %). The developed biosensor showed high operational and storage stability...|$|R
