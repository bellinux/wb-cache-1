There was no trace of moisture in that crystalline atmosphere, the sun that had no heat in it shone dazzlingly, and the snow that flung the sun's rays back fell from her feet dusty and dry as flour. No cloud flecked the clear blueness overhead, and fainter washes of the same <b>cold</b> <b>colour</b> marked the beaten trails and prints of horse-hoofs that alone broke the gleaming surface of the white expanse below. On the far horizon she could see grey blurs, which were presumably trees.|$|E
60|$|A day or {{two after}} the {{conversation}} I have related, our party left Satanstoe, with some éclat. The team belonged equally to the Follocks and the Littlepages, one horse being the property of my father, while the other belonged to Col. Follock. The sleigh, an old one new painted for the occasion, was the sole property of the latter gentleman, and was consigned, in mercantile phrase, to Dirck, {{in order to be}} disposed of as soon as we should reach the end of our journey. On its exterior it was painted a bright sky-blue, while its interior was of vermilion, a colour that was and is much in vogue for this species of vehicle, inasmuch as it carries with it the idea of warmth; so, at least, the old people say, though I will confess I never found my toes any less cold in a sleigh thus painted, than in one painted blue, which is usually thought a particularly <b>cold</b> <b>colour</b> to the feet.|$|E
6000|$|It is poor work, however, {{talking about}} the colour of things in Venice. The fond spectator is perpetually {{looking at it from}} his window, when he is not {{floating}} about with that delightful sense of being for the moment a part of it, which any gentleman in a gondola is free to entertain. Venetian windows and balconies are a dreadful lure, and while you rest your elbows on these cushioned ledges the precious hours fly away. But in truth Venice isn't in fair weather a place for concentration of mind. The effort required for sitting down to a writing-table is heroic, and the brightest page of MS. looks dull beside the brilliancy of your milieu. All nature beckons you forth and murmurs to you sophistically that such hours should be devoted to collecting impressions. Afterwards, in ugly places, at unprivileged times, you can convert your impressions into prose. Fortunately for the present proser the weather wasn't always fine; the first month was wet and windy, and it was better to judge of the matter from an open casement than to respond to the advances of persuasive gondoliers. Even then however there was a constant entertainment in the view. It was all <b>cold</b> <b>colour,</b> and the steel-grey floor of the lagoon was stroked the wrong way by the wind. Then there were charming cool intervals, when the churches, the houses, the anchored fishing-boats, the whole gently-curving line of the Riva, seemed to be washed with a pearly white. Later it all turned warm--warm to the eye as well as to other senses. After the middle of May the whole place was in a glow. The sea took on a thousand shades, but they were only infinite variations of blue, and those rosy walls I just spoke of began to flush in the thick sunshine. Every patch of colour, every yard of weather- stained stucco, every glimpse of nestling garden or daub of sky above a calle, began to shine and sparkle--began, as the painters say, to [...] "compose." [...] The lagoon was streaked with odd currents, which played across it like huge smooth finger-marks. The gondolas multiplied and spotted it allover; every gondola and gondolier looking, at a distance, precisely like every other.|$|E

50|$|It ought, in my opinion, to be indispensably observed, {{that the}} masses of light in a picture be always of a warm, mellow colour, yellow, red, or a {{yellowish}} white, and that the blue, the grey, or the green colours be kept almost entirely out of these masses, and be used only to support or set off these warm colours; and for this purpose, {{a small proportion of}} <b>cold</b> <b>colour</b> will be sufficient.

40|$|Context. Most games {{make use}} of {{graphics}} {{to create an environment}} that fits the mood they wish to convey. To use a game's graphical attributes such as colour, shape and texture to their utmost ability, knowing how these are perceived could help. Objective. This paper tries to determine how graphical attributes such as colour, texture, and shapes affect the perceived safety of a path inside a 3 d environment. Method. To reach the objective, an experiment was conducted with 20 participants. The experiment was a two-alternative forced-choice (2 AFC) test of 38 pairs of images, where each pair contained two versions of a tunnel entrance scene rendered using different graphical attributes. Each difference was based around either colour (warm and <b>cold</b> <b>colour</b> schemes), shape (round, wide, angular and thin), or texture (rugged, neutral and sterile). Results. The experiment generated results that varied compared to the expected results. For instance, the wider shapes were seen as safer compared to the thinner shapes, as was the same result with rounder shapes being perceived safer than angular shapes. Although a few preferred the <b>cold</b> <b>colour</b> scheme, the warmer colour scheme was seen as safer by the majority. While expected to be perceived as less safe than neutral textures but more than the rugged ones, the sterile texture was actually most commonly seen as safe. Conclusions. The main conclusion that was made is that colour, texture and shape can be applied to change the perception of safety in a scene. However, when opposing attributes are used in combination, the result might be based on how dominant the attribute is. The dominance of the graphical attributes could be an interesting topic for future work...|$|E

Le Brocquy later died, in 2012. The Edge had brought le Brocquy's work to Steinberg's attention, and she became convinced that his paintings could be interpreted through dance. The music for <b>Cold</b> Dream <b>Colour</b> is composed by The Edge in collaboration with Paul Chavez (known for his experimental electronic compositions under the project name FeltLike). Besides sharing in the choreography and lighting design for the work, Steinberg also staged a solo dance as well as a duet with her sister. Oguri also had roles as choreographer and dancer. The work had its US première at REDCAT in Los Angeles in 2012; a review in the Los Angeles Times said that [...] "Visceral expressionism and a prodigious visual beauty coalesced ... a striking visual success", but that it was less certain whether the nature of le Brocquy's paintings had been conveyed to the less-familiar American audience. Excerpts from <b>Cold</b> Dream <b>Colour</b> were performed at the Guggenheim Museum's Works & Process series for two nights in 2013 in New York, with Irish broadcaster John Kelly moderating a discussion of the work with its creators.

But the character of that central clearance still became clearer and clearer.

30|$|The {{choice of}} colours in images {{may affect the}} reader’s {{feelings}} (Painter et al. 2013), with for instance the choice of warm and vibrant colours in the letter by Le rire médecin (Figure  3) creating cheerful splashes of ambience {{and a sense of}} vitality, whereas the choice of <b>cold</b> <b>colours</b> and an unnaturalistic green background in the letter by SOS Villages d'enfants (Figure  1) mirrors the negative attitudinal meanings in the text of the letter (see earlier discussion). At the end of the continuum are the blue photographs in the letter by the Fondation du souffle contre les maladies respiratoires, an association that fights against respiratory diseases (see Table  1), which establish a gloomy mood, accentuated by the restriction to a single hue that gives the impression of being removed from the normality of everyday life.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method of {{manipulating}} both thermal change rate and thermal intensity to convey colour information {{by using a}} thermal tactile display.

Based on the semi-infinite body model, the thermal response within the skin for each stimulation form is investigated. The Peltier element of the display is designed to convey different thermal stimuli to the human finger. Two experiments {{are performed to evaluate}} the performance of the display: colour identification and discrimination. Experimental results indicate that there is a response bias among the perceived colours for the traditional method of only employing thermal intensity, but there is no response bias for the proposed method; subjects’ mean recognition accuracy with the proposed method is significantly higher than that gained using the traditional method. Furthermore, colour information of the captured images can be reliably discriminated by using this devised thermal tactile display...|$|R

Many of his works have an unusual dreamlike atmosphere, such as the surrealistic Miracle of St. Nicholas of Tolentino painted about 1455 and now housed in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, while his last works, particularly Last Judgment, Heaven, and Hell from about 1465 and Assumption painted in 1475, both at Pinacoteca Nazionale (Siena), are grotesque treatments of their lofty subjects.
