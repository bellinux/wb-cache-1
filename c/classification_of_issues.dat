40|$|Starting from {{a review}} of models of {{positional}} and valence issues, the paper – by tapping into the original definition of valence issue – introduces a <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> based on their level of overall, dychotomic agreement. This allows the placement of both positional and valence issues on a same continuum. A second dimension is then introduced, which identifies how much specific issues are over- or undersupported within a specific party. A visual <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> based on these two dimensions (the AP diagram) is then introduced, highlighting risks and opportunities for a party in campaigning on specific issues. Specific indicators (namely, issue yield) and hypotheses derived from the AP model are tested on survey data from the EU Profiler project, which collected issue profiles of Internet users from the 27 EU Countries before the EP 2009 Elections. The {{results show that the}} suggested dimensions and indicators identify a wide cross-country and cross-issue variance. Also, indicators generated by the AP model are powerful predictors of issue saliency, even subsuming traditional Downsean indicators. political issues; valence; position; party competition; European elections...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide an {{overview}} of tolerance analysis. Tolerancing decisions can profoundly impact the quality and cost of product. There is a strong need for increased attention to tolerance design to enable high-precision assemblies to be manufactured at lower costs. Indeed, tolerance analysis is a key element in industry for improving product quality. Designers want tight tolerances to assure product performance; manufacturers prefer loose tolerances to reduce cost. There is a critical need for a quantitative design tool for specifying tolerances. Tolerance analysis brings the engineering design requirements and manufacturing capabilities together in a common model, where the effects of tolerance specifications on both design and manufacturing requirements can be evaluated quantitatively. Significant amount of literature is related to tolerancing methods. Summaries of state of the art, the most recent developments, and the future trends in tolerancing research can be found.

40|$|The authors {{conducted}} three participatory workshops {{with members}} of the Victorian Local Government Association (VLGA). The latter is a lobby group funded by local municipalities within the metropolis of Melbourne, Australia. The aim of our workshops was to strategically evaluate the possible directions that VLGA might take over the next ten years. The first workshop used “situation-structuring” software; the second employed “cognitive mapping”; and the third exploited a “strategic planning” program. Some software packages were more useful than others, as verified by both the authors’ observations and the participants’ post-workshop evaluations, and here we speculate why. We conclude that situation structuring software is extremely useful since it invariably generates <b>classifications</b> <b>of</b> underlying <b>issues</b> that are eminently plausible. On the other hand, the cognitive mapping software that we used is often confusing, easy to misapply and critically dependent on having an innovative facilitator for its success. Finally, “strategic planning” software, especially if it is of the self-improving kind, is potentially, very useful for better organizational planning. Nevertheless, the impact of our workshops on VLGA’s daily operations appears to have been negligible. Again, we speculate why, and we also relate our conclusions to those found in the decision-aiding literature...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn dynamic value {{networks}} (VNs), knowledge {{serves as}} a basis for close collaboration of actors (i. e. firms with their partners and customers) to enhance co-creation of integrated solutions. In order to provide a technical foundation for seamless knowledge transfer among actors, VNs require distributed and interoperable intra- and inter-organizational knowledge management systems (KMS), which rely largely on advanced information and communication technology (ICT). KMS cannot be seen as stand-alone information systems but should address a variety <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> (e. g. organizational or social issues) in relation to knowledge management. Therefore, the new generation of such complex systems, appropriate for VNs, must deal with this variety <b>of</b> <b>issues,</b> ranging from merely business-oriented to pure technologically-oriented issues. Although scholars have studied knowledge transfer and ICT issues in VN settings, their insights and results remain fragmented because of the diverse research efforts from different perspectives (either from a more business or a more technical perspective). This necessitates that a broader perspective needs to be established. This study endeavors to address simultaneously potential <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> both knowledge transfer and ICT in a VN by developing a comprehensive integrated framework. The development of the framework is based on a three-step methodology which comprises the exploration and <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> generic ICT <b>issues</b> in a VN setting, and subsequently integrating knowledge transfer issues with ICT issues. The proposed integrated framework provides a well-structured theoretical basis for future KMS requirement engineering in VN environments...|$|R
