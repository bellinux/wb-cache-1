60|$|But {{it is not}} ignoble to {{feel that}} the fuller life which a sad {{experience}} has brought us is worth our own personal share of pain. Surely {{it is not possible to}} feel otherwise, any more than it would be possible for a man with cataract to regret the painful process by which his dim blurred sight of men as trees walking had been exchanged for clear outline and effulgent day. The growth of higher feeling within us is like the growth of faculty, bringing with it a sense of added strength. We can no more wish to return to a narrower sympathy than a painter or a musician can wish to return to his cruder manner, or a philosopher to his less <b>complete</b> <b>formula.</b>|$|E

He himself admits this, {{and goes on}} to say that while he is certain that we are in the presence of an unknown force, he is convinced that the phenomena will ultimately be found orderly, like all other facts of nature. 'Therefore, in the critical state of research, the scientific problem, it seems to me, is not whether spiritism be true or false, but whether metapsychical phenomena are real or imaginary. Some future Newton will discover a more <b>complete</b> <b>formula</b> than ours,' he prophesies. 'Every natural fact should be studied, and if it be real, incorporated in the patrimony of knowledge.' He then adds, with the true scientist's humble acknowledgment of the infinite reach of the undiscovered universe: 'Our knowledge is very limited and our experience young.'" ...|$|E

40|$|The thesis studies {{classes of}} Boolean {{formulae}} {{for which the}} well-known satisfiability problem is solvable in polynomially bounded time. It focusses on classes based on unit resolution; it describe classes of unit refutation <b>complete</b> <b>formulae,</b> unit propagation <b>complete</b> <b>formulae</b> and focuses on the class of SLUR formulae. It presents properties of SLUR formulae {{as well as the}} recently obtained results. The main result is the coNP-completness of membership testing. Finally, several hierarchies are built over the SLUR class and their properties and mutual relations are studied. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R

40|$|This work {{implements}} and {{evaluates the}} recent <b>complete</b> addition <b>formulae</b> for the prime order elliptic curves of Renes, Costello and Batina on an FPGA platform. We implement three different versions:(1) an unprotected architecture; (2) an architecture protected through coordinate randomization; and (3) an architecture with both coordinate randomization and scalar splitting in place. The evaluation is done through timing analysis and test vector leakage assessment (TVLA). The {{results show that}} applying an increasing level of countermeasures leads to an increasing resistance against side-channel attacks. This is the ﬁrst work looking into side-channel security issues of hardware implementations of the <b>complete</b> <b>formulae...</b>|$|R
