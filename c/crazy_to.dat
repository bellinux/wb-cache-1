5|$|Crazy and Roz {{are then}} seen at a pier. Rozzie {{tells him that}} Vinnie is {{ditching}} town, her and the rumble, which makes Crazy {{the leader of the}} Stompers. Disgusted with Vinnie's cowardice, Roz allows <b>Crazy</b> <b>to</b> make love to her in an abandoned warehouse. Solly interrupts, and fights <b>Crazy</b> <b>to</b> get him to talk. As he is losing, Crazy lies, saying Vinnie killed the gang members. Vinnie packs up his things and leaves, but bumps into the Stompers and in time for the rumble. As the two gangs wait for Boogaloo to show up, Solly drives up, ready to arrest Vinnie. On the rooftop of a nearby building, Crazy begins shooting randomly towards the street, causing both gangs to begin shooting at each other. Vinnie tries to run and is shot at by Solly. Crazy jumps off the rooftop, landing on Solly, killing himself and Solly. As Roz calls up a radio station to make a memorial request in honor of Vinnie, he stands up and walks away, leaving Brooklyn.|$|E

25|$|Seeds of a split {{seemed to}} appear in mid-2006 {{around the same time}} as the {{redevelopment}} of the ECW brand. During a tag-team match on Velocity the Mexicools faced the reigning tag champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick. Although both teams respected each other during the match, Psicosis used the ropes to pick up an illegal pinfall to win the match. This led to Super Crazy questioning Psicosis' actions. Next, during a SmackDown! broadcast, Psicosis left <b>Crazy</b> <b>to</b> be attacked by The Great Khali after a match, saving his own skin and leaving his tag team partner to fend for himself. Psicosis would later abandon Crazy during a handicap match against Khali. On the June 23 edition of SmackDown!, Super Crazy and Psicosis got into a fist-fight after various miscommunications throughout the match, marking the split of the team. The two were still billed as members of the faction in the following weeks, even though they were interfering in each other's matches, until they had a match on an episode of SmackDown! which was won by Super Crazy. After the split, Super Crazy was moved to the Raw brand, while Psicosis stayed on SmackDown. On November 1, 2006, Psicosis' WWE contract was officially terminated by WWE because of his arrest in Mexico for stealing a car from 23-year-old Alexander Valencia Ramirez.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} in December 2007, when she recognized it applied to more scenarios and had a [...] "bigger meaning" [...] than originally. American television network National Broadcasting Company (NBC) had asked Swift to perform at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. However, an appearance could not be scheduled because Swift was touring at the time. Instead, Swift's father suggested using [...] "Change" [...] as a theme for the event. Therefore, [...] "Change" [...] was used during NBC's daily video highlights in August 2008, prior {{to the release of}} Fearless. [...] "I wrote the song ‘Change’ as an underdog story. It’s kind of <b>crazy</b> <b>to</b> think that the Olympics chose this as one of the songs to play during the Olympic Games", Swift commented. It was included on the AT Team USA Soundtrack (2008). The song was released as a promotional single on the iTunes Store on August 8, 2008. All proceeds were donated to the United States Olympic team.|$|E

Madonna went back to United States and performed [...] "Take a Bow" [...] on the American Music Awards of 1995, accompanied by Babyface and a full orchestra. Babyface said the performance was terrifying for him: [...] "I was nervous as hell. But you couldn't actually see my legs shaking under the suit. When we finished, {{she told me she}} had never been that nervous before. That was <b>crazy</b> <b>to</b> me -- I was thinking, 'You're Madonna, you're on stage all the time!'". She returned to Europe and sang the song Sanremo Music Festival. At the end of the performance, she thanked the audience in Italian language, and received standing ovation. Madonna did rehearse the song for 2004's Re-Invention World Tour, but it was ultimately cut from the setlist and not included in the show.|$|E

[...] Rosberg was puzzled over the incident; he said, [...] "I don't understand why Webber didn't hit the brakes. It was <b>crazy</b> <b>to</b> roll back across the track like that." [...] Gerhard Berger, who raced in Formula One for thirteen years, courted controversy when he accused Webber of causing the incident deliberately and claimed Webber planned to take out either Alonso or Hamilton. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner defended Webber {{in an interview with}} The Daily Telegraph, saying it was [...] "absurd" [...] that Webber attempted to take out another competitor and stated the car suffered heavy damage with the collision with the wall. Webber later went to Rosberg and apologised for the crash on the Friday before the Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|E

500|$|Following the match, the German {{players and}} {{managers}} offered words of consolation to the Brazilians. Löw and players Per Mertesacker and Philipp Lahm even compared {{the pressure on}} the Brazilian team and resulting heartbreaking defeat with Germany's own when they hosted the 2006 FIFA World Cup and also lost in the semifinals. Lahm added in an interview after the tournament that he had felt [...] "very uneasy" [...] during the match and [...] "not at all euphoric" [...] since the Brazilian team had made mistakes that [...] "don't usually happen at this level", and Mertesacker noted that despite featuring the Germans {{at the top of their}} game, [...] "even from the bench, [...] was <b>crazy</b> <b>to</b> watch". Kroos stated that, despite Brazil having good players, [...] "they couldn't show their best performance" [...] due to all the outside pressure, and expressed faith in [...] "them returning with a good squad". Löw observed in the immediate aftermath of the match that the Brazilian people were applauding his team. Later the Brazilian newspaper O Globo expressed appreciation for the gestures of the German players, calling them [...] "world champions of sympathy".|$|E

With {{the exception of the}} video's celebration scenes, BRTHR filmed in guerilla [...] "run and gun" [...] style, and occasionally paid local police to facilitate a setup. According to Azalea, the Indian elephant in the clip took a month to find, and [...] "the Indian mafia" [...] were needed to shut down a street in Mumbai for the filming of her scene with it. Avinash Shankar was later hired to consult to the filming's cultural and visual issues. BRTHR stated that [...] "Bounce" [...] was the most difficult music video they had ever directed because of the persistent difficulties they encountered with its on-location production and final version-editing. A narrative with a speech introducing Azalea at the wedding was cut from the final version. In an interview for Rap-Up, Azalea stated, [...] "It's just so <b>crazy</b> <b>to</b> dream something so big and actually see it happen".|$|E

500|$|In April 2008, Empire {{reported}} that the actor and Goldberg would write an episode for the animated television series The Simpsons. He also voiced a character in the episode, entitled [...] "Homer the Whopper", which opened the twenty-first season. Kevin Smith's romantic comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno rounded out 2008 for the actor. He and Elizabeth Banks portrayed the title roles: Pennsylvania roommates who try to make some extra cash by making an adult film together. After having difficulty trying to secure an R rating, Rogen commented to MTV, [...] "It's a really filthy movie," [...] but complained, [...] "It's really <b>crazy</b> <b>to</b> me that Hostel is fine, with people gouging their eyes out and shit like that... But you can't show two people having sex – that's too much". The picture was distributed on Halloween by The Weinstein Company and disappointed at the box office. Along with Reese Witherspoon, he voiced a character in the animated science fiction Monsters vs Aliens (2009), which did well commercially, {{with a total of}} $381.5million. He then starred in the Jody Hill-directed mall cop comedy Observe and Report, in which he portrayed bipolar mall security guard Ronnie Barnhart. The film opened in theatres on April 10. Critics noted a departure in Rogen's acting style from playing laid-back roles to playing a more sadistic character; Wesley Morris from The Boston Globe opined that [...] "Often with Rogen, his vulnerability makes his coarseness safe...Ronnie is something altogether new for Rogen. Vulnerability never arrives. He's shameless." [...] Later in 2009, Rogen starred in Apatow's third directorial feature, Funny People, with Adam Sandler. Rogen played a young, inexperienced comic while Sandler played a mentor of sorts to his character; the film had more dramatic elements in it than Apatow's previous efforts. Funny People was a commercial failure, coming short of its $75million budget, but has a [...] "fresh" [...] rating on Rotten Tomatoes.|$|E
500|$|In the teams' {{first meeting}} since the 2010 season, the Nittany Lions looked {{to achieve their}} fourth {{consecutive}} win in the series, however even a hometown paper, the York Daily Record, predicted the Lions would lose, albeit in a close game, citing Michigan's superiority on both offense and defense, as well as coaching, compared to Penn State's superiority on special teams and intangibles. [...] Penn State's edition of SB Nation also predicted the Lions would lose citing the Wolverines' better athletes, but noted that Michigan's quarterback Devin Gardner has thrown as many interceptions as touchdowns (8) coming into the game, and that Penn State's best chance to win would be if Michigan turned the ball over frequently. Coming off an embarrassing loss against Indiana, Penn State's coach Bill O'Brien was [...] "focused" [...] all week and {{refused to talk to}} the media about the prior week's loss, focusing strictly on the Michigan game, which was Homecoming for Penn State, was expected to be the first sellout of the season, and featured a whiteout, led by the student section. O'Brien noted, [...] "it would be <b>crazy</b> <b>to</b> think this is just another game". The game was Penn State's second national broadcast of the year, with Penn State alumnus Matt Millen providing color commentary on Penn State's homecoming weekend. Michigan, coming off a 42–13 victory over Minnesota, entered the game with a win-loss record of 5–0, one of two remaining undefeated teams in the Big Ten (the other was Ohio State, who was 6–0, and whom the Lions are scheduled to play on October 26). Michigan's defense, led by their star cornerback Blake Countless, who was tied for the NCAA lead with four interceptions entering the game, had yet to allow a rushing touchdown, and was expected to receive a boost from the return of their 2012 All-Big Ten linebacker Jake Ryan, who tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) the prior season. As such, a key for Penn State was to match Michigan's physicality in strong offensive line play and establish the line of scrimmage, both on offense and defense, as the game would be won in the trenches. The game was described as a [...] "critical juncture". Before the game, Penn State realized that, due to a Ticketmaster glitch, it had oversold student section tickets, and was forced to offer several alternate packages in order not to have to boot students.|$|E
