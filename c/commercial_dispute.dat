5|$|One of the {{questions}} on the later years of Cairano's career {{is that of the}} completion of the Martinengo mausoleum, the largest funereal monument of the Brescian renaissance. The commission to the jeweller and sculptor Bernardino delle Croci by the brothers Francesco and Antonio Il Martinengo of Padernello dated to 1503, with a term of three years for completion. The tomb was to house the remains of Bernardino Martinengo, the father of the two, who had left a bequest towards the work on his death in 1501 or 1502. However, it was still unfinished in 1516, when delle Croci was commissioned per a new contract to finish it by January 1518. The causes for the delay appear to have been, firstly, a <b>commercial</b> <b>dispute</b> between the jeweller and the clients, and secondly the war of 1512, which surely slowed the work, even if not entirely stopping it. It was not until 1516, following the reconquest of Brescia by the Venetian republic, that a new definitive agreement was made. The documents are incomplete but in fact the monument was completed and installed within the Corpus Christi church, probably within the terms of the contract.|$|E

40|$|Mediation is {{developing}} and increasingly {{becoming one of}} the most popular modes for resolving international <b>commercial</b> <b>disputes</b> worldwide. In the Pacific, mediation has also been introduced to resolve disputes and lessen the burden of the Courts with case backlogs and assist in the improvement of the business environment in the Region. Prior to the introduction of western systems of resolving disputes such as litigation, arbitration and mediation, Pacific Island Countries had their own traditional methods of resolving customary disputes. This paper therefore aims to study these methods and determine whether mediation is culturally fitting and whether mediation is the appropriate mode to resolve <b>commercial</b> <b>disputes</b> or cross-border <b>commercial</b> <b>disputes</b> in these countries. Further, it will address whether introducing more traditional customs into the mediation rules that were introduced and developing the rules to suit these societies, would have any benefits in resolving <b>commercial</b> <b>disputes...</b>|$|R
25|$|Sébastiani {{recognized}} the Bourbon Restoration, but rallied with Napoleon during the Hundred Days, being {{elected to the}} Chamber {{for the first time}} in 1815. Briefly exiled after the return of King Louis XVIII, he was again admitted as a Deputy in 1819, sitting with the Left faction, supporting liberal politics, and coming into conflict with the Jean-Baptiste de Villèle Cabinet. After the July Revolution, he endorsed Louis-Philippe. Sébastiani's time as Foreign Minister saw France's involvement in the Belgian Revolution, its refusal to sanction the November Uprising, the controversial solution to a <b>commercial</b> <b>dispute</b> with the United States, and the French occupation of Ancona. In later years, he progressed in French Government service as an ambassador.|$|E

After spending {{a brief period of}} time under Cambodian flag {{the ship was}} again registered to Russia and classified by the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping. On 21 June 2011, after having been anchored off Muara Asam Asam in Kalimantan, Indonesia, for almost two months due to a <b>commercial</b> <b>dispute</b> on a quality of loaded nickel ore, seven crew members managed to purchase three litres of pure spirits from a ship chandler to have a party. Unbeknownst to them, the captain of the ship had asked the ship chandler to deliver ethanol for the ship's medical kit, but had rejected the suspicious-looking bottles because they had no prints proving that the content was suitable for medical use. Instead of 90–95% ethanol spirit the liquid in the bottles contained 36% of methanol, and four of the seven crew members involved in the party {{died as a result of}} methanol poisoning.|$|E

2500|$|The Times {{published}} an article alleging that the key aim of the Kremlin was to stifle the continued expansion of the EU and NATO into Eastern Europe by exposing Ukraine as an unreliable ally. This view was shared by Vladimir Milov, president of the Institute of Energy Policy in Moscow and former deputy energy minister of Russia, who also claimed that Russia was putting pressure on the Ukrainian government for pursuing pro-western goals. The US Ambassador to NATO, Kurt Volker, stated that {{although it was a}} <b>commercial</b> <b>dispute,</b> he believed that Russia was using the event to gain political leverage. Contrarily, the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies concluded in a report: [...] "We {{do not believe that the}} often-cited desire of the Russian government to use energy as an economic or political ‘weapon' against European countries played any part in this crisis." [...] Although the report also stated that the Russian decision to cut back deliveries on January 5, 2009 [...] "may have reflected Prime Minister Putin’s anger and frustration, and been aimed at punishing Ukraine for its repeated threats to disrupt transit. These emotions may have been personalized to President Yushchenko, given the historical animosity of Russia towards the Orange Revolution and towards Yushchenko’s subsequent policy orientation away from Russia." ...|$|E
60|$|One fact {{is clear}} and indisputable. The public and avowed origin of this quarrel was on taxation. This quarrel has indeed brought on new {{disputes}} on new questions; but certainly the least bitter, and the fewest of all, on the trade laws. To judge {{which of the two}} be the real radical cause of quarrel, we have to see whether the <b>commercial</b> <b>dispute</b> did, in order of time, precede the dispute on taxation? There is not a shadow of evidence for it. Next, to enable us to judge whether at this moment a dislike to the trade laws be the real cause of quarrel, it is absolutely necessary to put the taxes out of the question by a repeal. See how the Americans act in this position, and then {{you will be able to}} discern correctly what is the true object of the controversy, or whether any controversy at all will remain. Unless you consent to remove this cause of difference, it is impossible, with decency, to assert that the dispute is not upon what it is avowed to be. And I would, Sir, recommend to your serious consideration whether it be prudent to form a rule for punishing people, not on their own acts, but on your conjectures? Surely it is preposterous at the very best. It is not justifying your anger by their misconduct, but it is converting your ill-will into their delinquency.|$|E
