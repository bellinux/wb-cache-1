40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} dollar exchange rate and <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price.</b> Unlike previous literature which established a bilateral causal {{relationship between the two}} prices, this paper proposes that gold price {{is likely to be a}} common driver of the two prices and therefore, the bilateral relationship is a part of a triangular system of gold price, dollar exchange rate and <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price.</b> The results show that while in the short run gold price movement does not Granger cause the movement of the dollar exchange rate and <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price,</b> it is the Granger causality between the two prices in the long run. Causality is also identified from dollar exchange rate to <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> in both short run and long run. But <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> is much less influential in its bilateral relationship with dollar exchange rate. As a result, a triangular system of gold price, dollar exchange rate and <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> is established. Dollar exchange rate not only has direct impacts on <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price,</b> but also functions as an intermediary vehicle through which gold price movement indirectly affects <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price.</b> However, the relationship between dollar exchange rate and <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> is unstable with multiple structural breaks over the sample period. This partially explains why previous studies have mixed results. ...|$|R

30|$|However, the <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> and the Korean market import <b>price</b> for <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> {{and hence}} the {{consumer}} price for petroleum products {{do not have a}} one-to-one matching relationship. This is so, for the determining of the market import <b>price</b> of <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> is a very complex process and also the incorporation of fixed tax levied on petroleum product prices dilutes the effects of the changes in <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price.</b> Hence, the market price of the petroleum products does not directly reflect the changes in <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price.</b> Thus, this paper looks at scenarios of when the <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> declines and rises by 10 and 15 %, respectively, and how the changes affect the Korean economy. The size of the increment and decrement of the <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> is just ‘set’ at 10 and 15 %, since a change in <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> would not ‘naturally’ affect the consumer prices. Due to the process involved, determining a clear relationship between the changes in the <b>crude</b> <b>oil</b> <b>price</b> and its import market price and also with the consumer prices for petroleum products is not a straightforward task.
