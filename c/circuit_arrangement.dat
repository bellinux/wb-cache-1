5000|$|Note {{that the}} term 'ultra linear' was {{expressly}} reserved only for the condition of optimum tapping point. As Hafler and Keroes wrote:"Our patent claims cover {{the use of any}} primary tap in this <b>circuit</b> <b>arrangement.</b> However, we have restricted {{the use of the term}} [...] "Ultra Linear" [...] to the conditions where the dynamic plate characteristic curves are most linear".|$|E
50|$|The major {{advantage}} of this <b>circuit</b> <b>arrangement</b> stems from {{the placement of the}} upper field-effect transistor (FET) as the load of the input (lower) FET's output terminal (drain). Because at operating frequencies the upper FET's gate is effectively grounded, the upper FET's source voltage (and therefore the input transistor's drain) is held at nearly constant voltage during operation. In other words, the upper FET exhibits a low input resistance to the lower FET, making the voltage gain of the lower FET very small, which dramatically reduces the Miller feedback capacitance from the lower FET's drain to gate. This loss of voltage gain is recovered by the upper FET. Thus, the upper transistor permits the lower FET to operate with minimal negative (Miller) feedback, improving its bandwidth.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{principal}} limitations of the triode valve {{is that there is}} considerable capacitance between the grid and the anode (Cag). A phenomenon known as the Miller Effect causes the input capacitance of an amplifier to be the product of Cag and amplification factor of the valve. This, and the instability of an amplifier with tuned input and output when Cag is large can severely limit the upper operating frequency. These effects can be overcome by the addition of a screen grid, however in the later years of the tube era, constructional techniques were developed that rendered this 'parasitic capacitance' so low that triodes operating in the upper very high frequency (VHF) bands became possible. The Mullard EC91 operated at up to 250 MHz. The anode-grid capacitiance of the EC91 is quoted in manufacturer's literature as 2.5 pF, which is higher than many other triodes of the era, while many triodes of the 1920s had figures which are strictly comparable, so there was no advance in this area. However, early screen-grid tetrodes of the 1920s, have Cag of only 1 or 2fF, around a thousand times less. 'Modern' pentodes have comparable values of Cag. Triodes were used in VHF amplifiers in 'grounded-grid' configuration, a <b>circuit</b> <b>arrangement</b> which prevents Miller feedback.|$|E

40|$|For {{the pure}} or {{azeotropic}} refrigerants typically used in present {{air conditioning and}} refrigeration applications, the refrigerant changes phase at a constant temperature. Thus, the refrigerant <b>circuiting</b> <b>arrangement</b> such as crossfiow, counterfiow, or cross-counterflow, {{has no effect on}} the thermal performance. For zeotropic refrigerant mixtures, however, the phase-change occurs over a temperature range, or "glide", and the refrigerant <b>circuiting</b> <b>arrangement,</b> or flow path through the heat exchanger, can affect the thermal performance of both the heat exchangers as well as the overall efficiency of the vapor compression cooling cycle. The effects of tsvo diflerent <b>circuiting</b> <b>arrangements</b> on the thermal performance of a zeotropic retligerant mixture and an almost azeotropic refrigerant mixture in a four-row cross-countertlow heat exchanger arrangement are reported here. The two condensers differ only in the manner of circuiting the refrigerant tubes, where one has refrigerant always flowing downward in the active heat transfer region ("identical order") and the other has refrigerant alternating flow direction in the active heat transfer region ("inverted order"). All other geometric parameters, such as bce are% fin louver geometry, refrigerant tube size and enhancement etc., are the same for both heat exchangers. One refrigerant mixture (R- 41 OA) un&rgoes a small temperature change ("low glide") during phase change, and the other retligerant mixture (a multi- component proprietary mixture) has a substantial temperature change ("high glide") of approximately 10 "C during the phase change process. The overall thermal conductance, two-phase conductance, and pressure drop are presented. For the flow conditions of these tests, which are representative of resi&ntial cooling conditions, inverted order circuiting is more desirable than identical order. The potential thermal advantages of the i&ntical order arrangement for high-glide zeotropic refrigerant mixtures are negated by the increased parasitic refrigerant-side pressure drop utiortunately resulting from tkbrication requirements of the identical order circuiting...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with passive network synthesis in a mechanical context and applications to vehicle suspensions. This dissertation first presents a modified test for positive-realness of real-rational functions which appears only subtly different from a known condition. The test allows existing results to be derived more simply and allows more general results to be established. We then consider a realisation problem of restricted complexity where the number of dampers and inerters is restricted to one in each case, while allowing an arbitrary number of springs and no transformers (levers). The solution uses element extraction of the damper and inerter followed by the derivation of a necessary and sufficient condition for the one-element-kind (transformerless) realisation of an associated three-port network. This involves the derivation of a necessary and sufficient condition for a third-order non-negative definite matrix to be reducible to a paramount matrix using a diagonal transformation. It is shown that the relevant class of mechanical admittances can be parametrised in terms of five <b>circuit</b> <b>arrangements</b> each containing four springs. We investigate and compare the performances of the five <b>circuit</b> <b>arrangements</b> proposed when applied to suspension systems. One of the five circuits {{has appeared in the}} literature and therefore serves as the benchmark. One or more <b>circuit</b> <b>arrangements</b> appear to outperform the benchmark in terms of each individual performance measure among the three of interest and a multi-objective performance measure incorporating two of the three individual performance measures. Finally, we consider the minimum reactance synthesis of a class of biquadratic functions by reactance extraction. We show that at most four dampers are needed to synthesise the remaining resistive 3 -port network when explicit conditions are met. The results are an advancement on an equivalent problem studied in the electrical network case. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
