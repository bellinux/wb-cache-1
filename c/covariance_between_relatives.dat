The genuine impact of these two breakthroughs only became apparent about five decades later with the advent of affordable high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies. In addition, Schnell extended the theory of selection for quantitative traits to multiple stages and developed models for assessing the influence of epistasis on heterosis. Last but not least, he modernized the design and analysis of plant breeding field experiments by implementing new statistical tools and electronic data processing technologies.|$|E

40|$|The {{expression}} of an imprinted gene {{is dependent on}} the sex of the parent it was inherited from, and as a result reciprocal heterozygotes may display different phenotypes. In contrast, maternal genetic terms arise when the phenotype of an offspring is influenced by the phenotype of its mother beyond the direct inheritance of alleles. Both maternal effects and imprinting may contribute to resemblance between offspring of the same mother. We demonstrate that two standard quantitative genetic models for deriving breeding values, population variances and <b>covariances</b> <b>between</b> <b>relatives,</b> are not equivalent when maternal genetic effects and imprinting are acting. Maternal and imprinting effects introduce both sex-dependent and generation-dependent effects that result in differences in the way additive and dominance effects are defined for the two approaches. We use a simple example to demonstrate that both imprinting and maternal genetic effects add extra terms to <b>covariances</b> <b>between</b> <b>relatives</b> and that model misspecification may over- or underestimate true covariances or lead to extremely variable parameter estimation.

40|$|The {{level of}} {{expression}} of an imprinted gene {{is dependent on}} the sex of the parent from which it was inherited. As a result, reciprocal heterozygotes in a population may have different mean phenotypes for quantitative traits. Using standard quantitative genetic methods for deriving breeding values, population variances, and <b>covariances</b> <b>between</b> <b>relatives,</b> we demonstrate that although these approaches are equivalent under Mendelian expression, this equivalence is lost when genomic imprinting is acting. Imprinting introduces both parent-of-origin-dependent and generation-dependent effects that result in differences in the way additive and dominance effects are defined for the various approaches. Further, imprinting creates a <b>covariance</b> <b>between</b> additive and dominance terms absent under Mendelian expression, but the expression for this covariance cannot be derived using a number of the standard approaches for defining additive and dominance terms. Inbreeding also generates such a covariance, and we demonstrate that a modified method for partitioning variances can easily accommodate both inbreeding and imprinting. As with inbreeding, the concept of breeding values has no useful meaning for an imprinted trait. Finally, we derive the expression for the response to selection under imprinting, and conclude that the response to selection for an imprinted trait cannot be predicted from the breeder’s equation, even when there is no dominance...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has {{pointed to the}} ubiquity and abundance of between-generation epigenetic inheritance. This {{research has}} implications for assessing disease risk and the responses to ecological stresses and also for understanding evolutionary dynamics. An important step toward a general evaluation of these implications is the identification and estimation {{of the amount of}} heritable, epigenetic variation in populations. While methods for modeling the phenotypic heritable variance contributed by culture have already been developed, there are no comparable methods for nonbehavioral epigenetic inheritance systems. By introducing a model that takes epigenetic transmissibility (the probability of transmission of ancestral phenotypes) and environmental induction into account, we provide novel expressions for <b>covariances</b> <b>between</b> <b>relatives.</b> We have combined a classical quantitative genetics approach with information about the number of opportunities for epigenetic reset between generations and assumptions about environmental induction to estimate the heritable epigenetic variance and epigenetic transmissibility for both asexual and sexual populations.

40|$|Fixed effects {{models have}} {{dominated}} the statistical analysis of genetic crosses between inbred strains. In spite of their popularity, the traditional models ignore polygenic background and must be tailored to each specific cross.

The biggest difficulty in implementing random effect models {{is the lack of}} a coherent way of calculating trait <b>covariances</b> <b>between</b> <b>relatives.</b> The standard model for outbred populations is based on premises of genetic equilibrium that simply do not apply to crosses between inbred strains since every animal in a strain is genetically identical and completely homozygous. We fill this theoretical gap by introducing novel combinatorial entities called strain coefficients. With an appropriate theory, it is possible to reformulate QTL mapping and QTL association analysis as an application of mixed models involving both fixed and random effects. After developing this theory, our first example compares the mixed effects model to a standard fixed effects model using simulated advanced intercross line (AIL) data. Our second example deals with hormone data. Here multivariate traits and parameter identifiability questions arise.

40|$|Self-fertilization and {{crossing}} were combined {{to produce a}} large number of levels of inbreeding and of degrees of kinship. The inbreeding effect increases with the complexity of the character and with its supposed relationship with fitness. A certain amount of heterozygosity appears to be necessary for the expression of variability. With crossing of unrelated noninbred plants, genetic variance is mainly additive, but with inbreeding its major part is nonadditive. High additivity in crossing, therefore, coexists with strong inbreeding depression. However, even in inbreeding the genetic coefficient of covariation among relatives appears to be strongly and linearly related to the classical coefficient of kinship. This means that deviations from the additive model with inbreeding could be partly due to an effect of inbreeding on variances through an effect on means. An attempt to analyze genetic effects from a theoretical model, based upon the identity by descent relationship at the level of means and of <b>covariances</b> <b>between</b> <b>relatives,</b> tends to show that allelic interactions are more important and nonallelic interactions are less important for a character closely related to fitness. For a complex character, these results lead to the conception of a genome organized in polygenic complementary blocks integrating epistasis and dominance.

As genes can be identical by descent, numerous parameters are needed in the classical approach to describe the inbreeding effects on the mean and variance of 4 x- 2 x hybrids. Using the concept of test value, the model allows a large {{decrease in the number of}} required parameters. The model gives the components of genetic variance and usual <b>covariances</b> <b>between</b> <b>relatives</b> using these synthetic parameters. The model is then used to study the efficiency of a recurrent breeding scheme to improve diploid genitors for their combining ability with tetraploid genitors. It appears that, in presence of dominance, ignoring the meiosis pattern will lead to an overestimation of additive variance and then of genetic advance. Some genetic considerations on the differences between FDR and SDR mechanisms lead us to suggest an experimental comparison of their respective advantages and disadvantages for the type of considered recurrent selection.

How these sexual dimorphisms evolve despite the sexes sharing a majority of their genome remains an unresolved issue in evolutionary biology as theoretical models often disagree over the genetic mechanisms that are predicted to facilitate the evolution of sexual dimorphism. In this dissertation, I develop quantitative genetic methods for estimating sex-specific non-additive genetic and sex-linked additive genetic (co) variances. I then empirically quantify the genetic effects underlying population differences in sexually dimorphic traits using the water strider Aquarius remigis. I show that {{differences between}} the sexes in genetic architectures bias estimates of additive genetic variance if these differences are improperly incorporated into quantitative genetic analyses. I then develop the nadiv software package for the R statistical program to facilitate estimation of non-additive genetic (co) variances using the "animal model". Next, I use simulations to demonstrate that estimates of sex-specific additive genetic variances and between-sex additive genetic correlations are biased when sex-linked additive genetic variance is ignored. I create a genetic model of a sex-linked locus to derive general expressions for the <b>covariance</b> <b>between</b> <b>relatives</b> due to sex-linked genes applicable under any form of global sex chromosome dosage compensation.

I further show that the way by which sex-linked relatedness matrices under the various forms of dosage compensation differ from one another implies that unbiased estimates of sex-linked additive genetic variance can still be obtained even when the particular form of dosage compensation is unknown. Using population crosses of water striders, I show the net genetic effects contributing to sexually dimorphism differ between female and male water striders.

Gates' test for linkage was evaluated by theoretical analysis and computer simulation. A general express 10 n for variances and <b>covariances</b> <b>between</b> <b>relatives</b> in selfed generations derived from a cross of two inbred lines was developed for a two-locus model with both linkage and epistasis. From analysis of this general expression, epistasis was found to mimic the effects of repulsion linkage. Furthermore, the use of an approximate expectation for variances and covariances m Gates' test caused an upward bias in both additive and dominance effects involving linkage. Twenty genetic models were simulated with eight values of both coupling and repulsion linkages to determine under which genetic situations Gates' test is a valid test for linkage. Coefficients of determination (R 2), calculated as the proportion of total variability among 30 variances and covariances in Gates' test explained by additive and dominance effects only, were close to unity for most combinations of models and linkage values. R 2 values in repulsion linkages showed greater departure from unity than those in coupling linkages in both the presence and absence of epistasis. Although Gates' test generally fails to detect linkage because of high R 2 values, it is more sensitive to repulsion linkages than coupling linkages. Numbers of families in hierarchical mating designs were the single most important factor in determining precision of the estimated variances and covariances used m Gates' test for linkage. This number must be at least several hundred to give suitably precise estimates of variances and covariances for traits with low heritability. Numbers of sub-families and numbers of replications can be of minimum size (about two). Weighted least squares and maximum likelihood methods were used to fit linkage, epistasis or genotype-environmental interaction models to data from a two-year field evaluation of hierarchical progenies in two spring wheat crosses, Potam x Ingal and RL 4137 x Ingal. The genotype-environmental interaction model, which allows for heterogeneous error variances, was most satisfactory. The environmental variation between the two years {{may be due to the}} different climatological patterns. Among components of genetic variance, additive variance was of principal importance for all eight traits measured in both Potam x Ingal and RL 4137 x Ingal...|$|R

The multiple regression of the expected coefficients of additive direct, additive maternal, dominance direct, and dominance maternal genetic variance components; and additive direct by additive maternal and dominance direct by dominance maternal genetic covariances on the 24 estimated <b>covariances</b> <b>between</b> pairs of <b>relatives</b> gave a multiple correlation coefficient of. 95.

These results suggest for these data that only additive genetic effects are important for this trait. Additive genetic variance accounted for 38 % of total variance.
