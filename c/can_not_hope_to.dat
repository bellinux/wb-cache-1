40|$|Ocular neovascularizations are {{responsible}} for irreversible loss of vision in various diseases, including age-related macular degeneration. Treatments have changed greatly, and photodynamic therapy with verteporfin has come into common use. However, the visual prognosis remains poor. The recent approval of new antiangiogenic molecules such as ranibizumab and pegaptanib should allow for new therapeutical possibilities. The unapproved ophthalmological use of bevacizumab requires further studies. This paper updates {{what is known about}} old and new neovascularization treatments: their mechanism of action, their efficacy, and their toxicity. It reviews the principal clinical studies, and concludes with the recognized recommendations. For the first time, ophthalmologists <b>can</b> <b>hope</b> <b>not</b> only <b>to</b> stabilize loss of vision, but also to improve visual acuity. Complementary treatments can now be tested in associations, concomitantly or <b>not,</b> with the <b>hope</b> of improving visual results...|$|R

40|$|This survey {{article is}} an {{expanded}} {{version of a}} series of lectures given at the conference on Advances in Group Theory and its Applications which was held in Porto Cesareo in June of 2011. We are concerned with representations of finite group schemes, a class of objects that generalizes the more familiar finite groups. In the last 30 years, this discipline has enjoyed considerable attention. One reason is the application of geometric techniques that originate in Quillen’s fundamental work concerning the spectrum of the cohomology ring v[25, 26]. The subsequent developments pertaining to cohomological support varieties and representation-theoretic support spaces have resulted in many interesting applications. Here we will focus on those aspects of the theory that are motivated by the problem of classifying indecomposable modules. Since the determination of the simple modules is often already difficult enough, one <b>can</b> in general <b>not</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> solve this problem in a naive sense. However, the classification problem has resulted in an important subdivision of the category of algebras, which will be our general theme. The algebras we shall be interested in are the so-called cocommutative Hopf algebras, which are natural generalizations of group algebras of finite groups. The module categories of these algebras are richer than those of arbitrary algebras: • They afford tensor products which occasionally allow the transfer of information between various blocks of the algebra. • Their cohomology rings are finitely generated, making geometric methods amenable to application. The purpose of these notes is to illustrate how a combination of these features with methods from the abstract representation theory of algebras and quivers provides insight into classical questions...|$|R

In the setting of totally disconnected groups we provide sufficient conditions on an action G Q ensuring that the inclusion Q ⊂ Q ⋊ G is irreducible and that every intermediate subfactor is of the form Q ⋊ H for a closed subgroup H < G. This partially generalizes a result of Izumi-Longo-Popa [ILP 98] and Choda [Ch 78].

40|$|This thesis motivates and {{introduces}} {{a way to}} model fairness considerations in cooperative game theory. Fairness <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> be modeled as a fixed concept, independent of personas or cultures. Even if one restricts attention to a rather narrow field, like the political debate in Germany, the word fairness carries a variety of meanings ranging from equal merits for equal achievement or meritocracy to equal distribution of chances or even, sometimes, distribution according to needs. Therefore the thesis does not introduce a definition of fairness, but rather shows how to model fairness concepts as predicates on the imputation space. For each game, each fairness concept will label imputations as either fair, or unfair. A range of traditional and new fairness concepts are developed within this setting, and studied. As a benchmark for the feasibility of a fairness concept, the concept of satisfiability within the core is introduced. The rationale behind {{this is that it}} would be very disadvantageous if all players had the same concept of fairness and this fairness culture would still prevent stable cooperation in some situations where the core is non-empty. The thesis consists of three parts. The first part starts out, of course, with an introduction of important concepts and examples of cooperative game theory. While the most relevant traditional examples are included, a number of examples are proposed for the first time. Then a model of fairness and a rationality-of-fairness argument based on satisfiability within the core are developed. The second part deals with more specific classes of games. A certain emphasis is put on the case of bankruptcy games, but some results are also developed for convex games, the positive cone of unanimity games and for 1 -convex bankruptcy games. For convex games a conjecture is given as an open problem. The third part addresses the fact that dierent players might have dierent cultures of fairness – perceiving dierent imputations as fair, or unfair. An adapted form of the core inequalities gives the modified stability condition resulting in this setting. An example shows, how cooperation can become stable, interestingly enough, when certain players are culturally incompatible. A first strategy-proof-reporting result is also given on the reporting of individual fairness notions in a somewhat restricted setting. To a higher degree than in the other parts, the results of part three invite new questions and point towards open problems and opportunities for future work in this field...|$|R

40|$|Alarming {{food supply}} and demand deficits are {{projected}} to the year 2020 and beyond for Pakistan, based on its current low investment/low growth agricultural sector. Evidence suggests that agricultural productivity growth and increases in production may not keep pace with past growth rates. Part {{of the problem is}} an underfunded and poorly managed agricultural research system that <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> contribute significantly to increasing agricultural productivity now or in the future. The World Bank-assisted Agricultural Research II Project (ARP-II) was initiated to partially overcome some of the funding problems and provide institutional development in the areas of organisation, planning, and management of the research system at both the federal and provincial levels. A National Master Agricultural Research Plan (NMARP) was one of the principal goals of the ARP-II as part of improving research planning and management. The objective {{of this paper is to}} review the reasons why the Pakistan agricultural research system needs to be revitalised, review the status and problems of the present agricultural research system, and outline a future agenda for Pakistan’s agricultural research system based on the plan developed for the NMARP. ...|$|E

We study three types of nonlinear estimators: the sample median estimators, the geometric mean estimators, and the maximum likelihood estimators � (MLE). We derive tail bounds for the logn geometric mean estimators and establish that k = O ε 2 � suffices with the constants explicitly given. Asymptotically (as k → ∞), both the sample median and the geometric mean estimators are about 80 % efficient compared to the MLE.

We derive explicit tail bounds for the geometric mean estimator and establish an analog of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma for dimension reduction in l_ 1, which is weaker than the classical JL lemma for dimension reduction in l_ 2.

40|$|Cellular {{transformation}} is accomplished in vitro through the concerted action of growth factors and oncogenes. This association {{has demonstrated that}} malignant growth results from aberrations in pathways that normally operate to control proliferation. Activation of genes that code for growth factors, their receptors, and/or molecules essential in the transduction of signals from the cell surface to the nucleus are all potential mechanisms by which tumor cells could establish a selective growth advantage over normal cells. This dissertation addresses {{the question of what}} oncogenic mechanisms are important in the development and progression of human melanoma. These studies show that melanoma growth is regulated by endogenous substances produced by the melanoma cells themselves (autocrine stimulation), as well as by exogenous substances supplied by neighboring cells and platelets (paracrine stimulation). These factors work to drive the expression of the transformed phenotype for melanoma as evidenced by induction of serum-free soft agar growth. Human platelets were found to the the richest source of paracrine growth promoters. The factor from human platelets was characterized and partially purified. Melanoma cells respond to this 60, 000 molecular weight, disulfide-bond-containing protein in colony formation assays. In addition, the protein has endothelial cell growth factor activity. Purified fractions which promoted optimal colony formation for human melanoma cells also maximally stimulated monolayer growth of bovine aortic endothelial cells, while melanocytes were nonresponsive. This implies that melanoma cells are expressing receptors for a protein which plays no known or apparent role in the normal growth of melanocytes. Melanoma cells are sensitive to growth regulatory molecules of autocrine and paracrine nature. This dissertation provides clues to the genetic lesions which have occurred in these melanoma cells to influence their proliferation. The aberrations appear to reside in those genes important in growth factor pathways at the level of endogenous production and misguided response to exogenous factors through receptor expression. We <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> fully inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells until we identify and understand those forces which drive their growth. These studies have increased our knowledge of those signals which stimulate melanoma cellular proliferation, and thus provide insight into important therapeutic targets...|$|E
