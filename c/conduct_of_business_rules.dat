Further, the Government of Mizoram also created a separate department, in the Secretariat known as ‘District Council Affairs Department (DCA)’, {{to look after the}} affairs of the three ADC’s of Mizoram, and funds for the District Councils are channelised through this department. with the approval of the State Finance Department.

The Chairman and the Deputy Chairman are elected from amongst the MDCs themselves and they are similar to the Speaker and the Dy. Speaker of the State Legislative Assembly. The District Council also has an Executive Committee which function is similar to Cabinet of the State Govt. The Chief Executive Member(CEM) is the Head of the Executive Committee and is elected by the MDCs from amongst themselves. The CEM also recommends certain MDCs for appointment as Executive Member (EM) to the Governor of Mizoram for his approval. The post of CEM and EMs are similar to the Chief Minister and Cabinet Ministers of the state Government respectively. Each Autonomous District Council has also two Secretaries, one for the Executive Committee, designated as Executive Secretary and the other for Legislature, designated as Legislative Secretary. The post of Executive Secretary is similar to Chief Secretary of the State Govt. and the Legislative Secretary is similar to Secretary, Assembly Secretariat of the state Govt.As provided in the Rules, the LADC also has Two Secretaries, such as Executive Secretary and Legislative Secretary or Secretary, LADC. The Executive Secretary is for the Executive Committee and he also functioned as Drawing and Disbursing Officer of the Council fund.

40|$|In this paper, I analyse the <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>rules</b> {{included}} in the Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments (MiFID) which has replaced the Investment Services Directive (ISD). These rules, {{in addition to being}} part of the regulation of investment intermediaries, operate as contractual standards in the relationships between intermediaries and their clients. While the need to harmonise similar rules is generally acknowledged, in the present paper I ask whether the Lamfalussy regulatory architecture, which governs securities lawmaking in the EU, has in some way improved regulation in this area. In section II, I examine the general aspects of the Lamfalussy process. In section III, I critically analyse the MiFID s provisions on conduct of business obligations, best execution of transactions and client order handling, taking into account the new regime of trade internalisation by investment intermediaries and the ensuing competition between these intermediaries and market operators. In sectionIV, I draw some general conclusions on the re-regulation made under the Lamfalussy regulatory structure and its limits.

In their view, the upcoming MiFID review should therefore take a 'light touch', clarifying some definitions and extending price transparency to related segments of securities markets.

More specific: can a civil law judge lay upon a financial institution more and/or less far-reaching private law duties of care than pursuant to the applicable financial regulatory law? Does the applicable financial regulatory law, in other words, bind the civil judge or is he free to decide what level of duty of care can be expected from financial institutions in their relationships with (retail) investors?

40|$|In the {{currently}} highly competitive environment, the information systems <b>of</b> the <b>businesses</b> {{should not only}} effectively support the existing business processes, but {{also have to be}} dynamically adaptable to the changes in the environment. There are increasing efforts at separation of the application and the business logic in the information system. One of the appropriate instruments for this separation is the <b>business</b> <b>rule</b> approach. <b>Business</b> <b>rules</b> are simple, understandable rules. They can be used for the knowledge externalization and sharing also as for the active control and decisions within the business processes. Although the <b>business</b> <b>rule</b> approach is used for almost 20 years, the various specifications and practical applications <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>rules</b> are still a goal of the active research. The disadvantage <b>of</b> the <b>business</b> <b>rule</b> approach is great demands on obtaining of the rules. There has to be a domain expert, who is able to manually write them. One of the problems addressed by the current research is the possibility of (semi) automatic acquisition <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>rules</b> from the different resources - unstructured documents, historical data etc. This dissertation thesis addresses the problem of acquisition (learning) <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>rules</b> from the historical data of the company. The main objective of this thesis is to design and validate a method for (semi) automatic learning <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>rules</b> using the data mining of association rules. Association rule are a known data mining method for discovering of interesting relations hidden in the data. Association rules are comprehensible and explainable. The comprehensibility of association rules is suitable for the use of them for learning <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>rules.</b> For this purpose the user can use not only simple rules discovered using the algorithm Apriori or FP-Growth, but also more complex association rules discovered using the GUHA method. Within this thesis is used the procedure 4 ft-Miner implemented in the data mining system LISp Miner. The first part of this thesis contains the description of the relevant topics from the research <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>rules</b> and association <b>rules.</b> <b>Business</b> <b>rules</b> is not a name of one specification of standard but rather a label of the approach to modelling <b>of</b> <b>business</b> logic. As part of the work there is defined a process of selection of the most appropriate specification <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>rules</b> for the selected practical use. Consequently, the author proposed three models of involving of data mining <b>of</b> association <b>rules</b> into <b>business</b> <b>rule</b> sets. These models contain also the definition of a model for the transformation of GUHA association <b>rules</b> in the <b>business</b> <b>rules</b> for the system JBoss Drools. For the possibility <b>of</b> learning <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>rules</b> using the data mining results from more than one data set, the author proposed a knowledge base. The knowledge base is suitable for the interconnection <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>rules</b> and data mining of association rules. From the perspective <b>of</b> <b>business</b> <b>rules</b> the knowledge base is a term dictionary. From the perspective of data mining the knowledge base contains some background knowledge for data preprocessing and preparation of classification models. The proposed models have been validated using practical implementations in the systems EasyMiner (in conjunction with JBoss Drools) and Erian. The thesis contains also a description of two model use cases based on real data from the field of marketing and the field of health insurance...|$|R
