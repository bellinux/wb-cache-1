5000|$|Erythrite or {{red cobalt}} is a {{secondary}} hydrated <b>cobalt</b> <b>arsenate</b> mineral with the formula (Co3(AsO4)2·8H2O). Erythrite and annabergite (Ni3(AsO4)2·8H2O) (nickel arsenate) form a complete {{series with the}} general formula (Co,Ni)3(AsO4)2·8H2O.|$|E
50|$|Many {{pigments}} {{still in}} use are toxic to some degree. Commonly used reds and yellows are produced using cadmium, and vermilion red uses natural or synthetic mercuric sulfide or cinnabar. Flake white and Cremnitz white are made with basic lead carbonate. Some intense blue colors, including cobalt blue and cerulean blue, are made with cobalt compounds. Some varieties of cobalt violet are made with <b>cobalt</b> <b>arsenate.</b>|$|E
30|$|The purple shades {{in the end}} of Suzanne Bambridge’s left sleeve (wrist area) were {{achieved}} by mixing Ultramarine, Vermilion and lead white pigments. However, the brownish purple flaking layer, painted over the brighter purple layer that can be reasonably considered as original, notably differs through the presence of wax in the mixture (micro-fragment 10 investigated by ATR-FTIR). The same combination of pigments, admixed with Prussian blue, was identified in the small rounded purple brushstrokes suggesting flowers in the collar area. The probability of one or more further organic pigment(s) in the purple areas cannot be ignored. The absence of <b>cobalt</b> violet (<b>cobalt</b> <b>arsenates</b> and <b>cobalt</b> phosphates) and manganese violet, both identified in contemporaneous Gauguin’s oil paintings, has to be noticed.|$|R
50|$|Graphene oxide is {{non-toxic}} and biodegradable. Its {{surface is}} covered with epoxy, hydroxyl, and carboxyl groups that interact with cations and anions. It is soluble in water and forms stable colloid suspensions in other liquids because it is amphiphilic (able to mix with water or oil). Dispersed in liquids it shows excellent sorption capacities. It can remove copper, <b>cobalt,</b> cadmium, <b>arsenate,</b> and organic solvents.|$|R
40|$|Plant-associated pseudomonads are {{commonly}} exposed to copper bactericides, which {{are applied to}} reduce the disease incidence caused by these bacteria. Consequently, many of these bacteria have acquired resistance or tolerance to copper salts. We recently conducted a survey of 37 copper-resistant (Cur) Pseudomonas spp., including P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, P. syringae, and P. viridiflava, and found that {{a subset of the}} P. syringae strains showed a dramatic increase in exopolysaccharide (EPS) production on mannitol-glutamate medium containing CuSO 4 at 250 micrograms/ml. A modified carbazole assay indicated that the EPS produced on copper-amended media contained high levels of uronic acids, suggesting that the EPS was primarily alginic acid. Uronic acids extracted from selected strains were further confirmed to be alginate by demonstrating their sensitivity to alginate lyase and by descending paper chromatography following acid hydrolysis. Subinhibitory levels of <b>arsenate,</b> <b>cobalt,</b> lithium, rubidium, molybdenum, and mercury did not induce EPS production, indicating that alginate biosynthesis is not induced in P. syringae cells exposed to these heavy metals. A 200 -kb plasmid designated pPSR 12 conferred a stably mucoid phenotype to several P. syringae recipients and also increased their resistance to <b>cobalt</b> and <b>arsenate.</b> A cosmid clone constructed from pPSR 12 which conferred a stably mucoid phenotype to several P. syringae strains but not to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was obtained. Results obtained in this study indicate that some of the signals and regulatory genes for alginate production in P. syringae differ from those described for alginate production in P. aeruginosa...|$|R
50|$|The first cobalt violet, the {{intensely}} red-violet <b>cobalt</b> <b>arsenate,</b> {{was highly}} toxic. Although it persisted in some paint lines into the twentieth-century, it was displaced by less toxic cobalt compounds such as cobalt phosphate. Cobalt violet {{appeared in the}} second half of the 19th century, broadening the palette of artists. Cobalt violet was used by Paul Signac (1863-1935), Claude Monet (1840-1926), and Georges Seurat (1859-1891). Today, cobalt ammonium phosphate, cobalt lithium phosphate, and cobalt phosphate are available for use by artists. Cobalt ammonium phosphate is the most reddish of the three. Cobalt phosphate is available in two varieties — a deep less saturated blueish type and a lighter and brighter somewhat more reddish type. Cobalt lithium phosphate is a saturated lighter-valued bluish violet. A color similar to cobalt ammonium phosphate, cobalt magnesium borate, was introduced in the later twentieth-century but was not deemed sufficiently lightfast for artistic use. Cobalt violet is the only truly lightfast violet pigment with relatively strong color saturation. All other light-stable violet pigments are dull by comparison. However, the high price of the pigment and the toxicity of cobalt has limited its use.|$|E
40|$|Polystyrene-based <b>cobalt</b> <b>arsenate</b> {{membranes}} {{have been}} prepared by sol–gel method for various 1 : 1 electrolytes (KCl, NaCl and LiCl) at different concentrations. The conductance values of <b>cobalt</b> <b>arsenate</b> membranes {{have been found to}} increase with increase in concentration (0. 1 ≤ c (M) ≤ 0. 01) as well as temperature (10 – 50) ± 0. 1 °C. The conductance values of the investigated electrolytes have been found to follow the sequence K+ > Na+ > Li+. The larger the positive hydration of ions, the higher the activation energies of conductivity of the salt and the sequence for energy of activation followed this order: Ea K+ > Ea Na + > Ea Li+. The changes of Gibbs free energy (ΔG), entropy (ΔS), and enthalpy (ΔH) for the transition of ions from one quasi-equilibrium state were calculated at different concentrations. The values of ΔH, ΔG and ΔS were found to be positive and negative respectively. Among the ions of the same valence the order of ΔS was as follows Li+ > Na+ > K+. The prepared membranes were characterized by thickness, porosity, water uptake, swelling, chemical stability, morphology analysis and particle size. The membranes were found to be stable in acidic as well as basic environment. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{case studies}} that illustrate {{the usefulness of}} X-ray diffraction {{in the field of}} conservation science and archaeometry. X-ray diffraction was instrumental in discovering new pigments such as a yellow lead silicate sulfate chloride of the ellestadite group found on fresco fragments from an Abbasid structure built in the early eight century A. D. in Jordan; the yellow compound pararealgar (As 4 S 4), which was identified {{for the first time in}} a painting; and magnesium <b>cobalt</b> <b>arsenate,</b> a violet pigment found in numerous paintings. X-ray diffraction also helped answer questions related to degradation processes: crystals forming on artifacts in a Canadian museum were identified as cyclohexylamine hydrochloride (C 6 H 13 NAHCl). This finding was key in tracing the source of the problem back to vapour phase corrosion inhibitors used in the museum’s steam humidification system. Badly corroded metal fillets on a Boulle clock proved to be made of tin amalgam, which is susceptible to galvanic corrosion, instead of the more stable pewter. X-ray diffraction analysis of multi-layer samples is also discussed in relation with the later case study and with the study of paint samples taken from polychrome elements of the sculpted décor of the Ursulines chapel, Québec City...|$|E
30|$|The {{level of}} heavy metal {{tolerance}} {{is very high}} in P. putida W 619 in comparison to other P. putida strains (Canovas et al. [2003]; Taghavi et al. [2009]). In P. putida W 619, copper, <b>cobalt,</b> zinc, cadmium, <b>arsenate,</b> mercury, nickel chromate, and molybdenum resistance genes are present in two genomic regions (1 and 31). Heavy metal tolerance of P. putida LS 46 has not been investigated, but this strain encodes genes for heavy metal resistance present in genomic region 1 of P. putida W 619. These genes are involved in copper, cobalt, zinc, and cadmium resistance. However, the genes located on genomic region 31 of P. putida W 619, involved in copper and chromate resistance, were absent {{in the majority of}} P. putida strains, including P. putida LS 46 (Additional file 1 : Table S 8). All P. putida strains lacked the genes present in genomic region 18 of P. putida W 619, which were associated with mercury and nickel resistance.|$|R
40|$|Alkyl {{hydroperoxide}} reductase 1 (Ahp 1 p) is a thioredoxin peroxidase of the peroxiredoxin family {{expressed by}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Recently, {{disruption of the}} AHP 1 gene {{has shown that the}} gene is not essential for yeast growth on glucose medium but revealed a high sensitivity of null mutants to organic peroxides, suggesting that Ahp 1 p is an important enzyme implicated in oxidative stress protection in S. cerevisiae. To gain insight into antioxidant enzymatic mechanisms involved in cell protection against metal toxicity and glutathione depletion, we investigated the resistance of S. cerevisiae, in which the AHP 1 gene was disrupted, against several metals and diethyl maleate, a glutathione depleting agent. We report that Ahp 1 p protects yeast against toxicity induced by copper, <b>cobalt,</b> chromium, arsenite, <b>arsenate,</b> mercury, zinc and diethyl maleate, suggesting that Ahp 1 p {{plays an important role in}} S. cerevisiae in the protection against metals possibly by reducing peroxides generated in cells by these compounds...|$|R
40|$|Forty {{soil samples}} of {{agriculture}} soil {{were collected from}} two different sites in Sohag province, Egypt, during hot and cold seasons. Twenty samples were from soil irrigated with canal water (site A) and twenty samples were from soil irrigated with wastewater (site B). This study aimed to compare the incidence of plasmids in bacteria isolated from soil and to investigate the occurrence of metal and antibiotic resistance bacteria, and consequently to select the potential application of these bacteria in bioremediation. The total bacterial count (CFU/gm) in site (B) was higher than that in site (A). Moreover, the CFU values in summer were higher than those values in winter at both sites. A total of 771 bacterial isolates were characterized as Bacillus, Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Eschershia, Shigella, Xanthomonas, Acetobacter, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Moraxella and Methylococcus. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Pb+ 2, Cu+ 2, Zn+ 2, Hg+ 2, Co+ 2, Cd+ 2, Cr+ 3, Te+ 2, As+ 2 and Ni+ 2 for plasmid-possessed bacteria were determined and the highest MICs were 1200 µg/mL for lead, 800 µg/mL for both <b>Cobalt</b> and <b>Arsenate,</b> 1200 µg/mL for Nickel, 1000 µg/ml for Copper and less than 600 µg/mL for other metals. Bacterial isolates from both sites A and B showed multiple heavy metal resistance. A total of 337 bacterial isolates contained plasmids and the incidence of plasmids was approximately 25 - 50 % higher in bacteria isolated from site (B) than that from site (A). These isolates were resistance to different antibiotics. Approximately, 61 % of the bacterial isolates were able to assimilate insecticide, carbaryl, as a sole source of carbon and energy. However, the Citrobacter AA 101 showed the best growth on carbaryl...|$|R
40|$|The plant growth-promoting {{bacterium}} (PGPB) Pseudomonas sp. UW 4, previously {{isolated from}} the rhizosphere of common reeds growing {{on the campus of}} the University of Waterloo, promotes plant growth in the presence of different environmental stresses, such as flooding, high concentrations of salt, cold, heavy metals, drought and phytopathogens. In this work, the genome sequence of UW 4 was obtained by pyrosequencing and the gaps between the contigs were closed by directed PCR. The P. sp. UW 4 genome contains a single circular chromosome that is 6, 183, 388 bp with a 60. 05 % G+C content. The bacterial genome contains 5, 423 predicted protein-coding sequences that occupy 87. 2 % of the genome. Nineteen genomic islands (GIs) were predicted and thirty one complete putative insertion sequences were identified. Genes potentially involved in plant growth promotion such as indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis, trehalose production, siderophore production, acetoin synthesis, and phosphate solubilization were determined. Moreover, genes that contribute to the environmental fitness of UW 4 were also observed including genes responsible for heavy metal resistance such as nickel, copper, cadmium, zinc, molybdate, <b>cobalt,</b> <b>arsenate,</b> and chromate. Whole-genome comparison with other completely sequenced Pseudomonas strains and phylogeny of four concatenated "housekeeping" genes (16 S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB and rpoD) of 128 Pseudomonas strains revealed that UW 4 belongs to the fluorescens group, jessenii subgroup...|$|E
40|$|The plant growth-promoting {{bacterium}} (PGPB) Pseudomonas putida UW 4, previously {{isolated from}} the rhizosphere of common reeds growing {{on the campus of}} University of Waterloo, promotes plant growth in the presence of different environmental stresses, such as flooding, high concentration of salt, cold, heavy metals, drought and phytopathogens. The known mechanisms used by P. putida UW 4 to promote plant growth include 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) synthesis and siderophore production. In this work, the genome sequence of UW 4 was obtained by pyrosequencing and the gaps between the contigs were closed by directed PCR. The P. putida UW 4 genome contains a single circular chromosome that is 6, 183, 388 bp with a 60. 05 % G+C content. The bacterial genome contains 5, 431 predicted protein-coding sequences that occupy 87. 4 % of the genome. Nineteen genomic islands were predicted and thirty one complete putative insertion sequences were identified. Genome analyses were conducted in order to better characterize the general features of the UW 4 genome. Genes potentially involved in plant growth promotion such as IAA biosynthesis, trehalose production, siderophore production, and acetoin synthesis were identified, which will facilitate {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms of plant-microbe interactions. Moreover, genes that contribute to the environmental fitness of UW 4 were also determined including genes responsible for heavy metal resistance such as nickel, copper, cadmium, zinc, molybdate, <b>cobalt,</b> <b>arsenate,</b> and chromate. Central metabolic pathways helped elucidate the physiological roles of diverse metabolites of UW 4. Unexpectedly, whole-genome comparison with other completely sequenced Pseudomonas sp. revealed that UW 4 is more similar to the fluorescens group rather than to the putida group. More surprisingly, a putative type III secretion system (T 3 SS) was found in the UW 4 genome, and T 3 SS was thought to be essential for bacterial pathogenesis. Although putative T 3 SS was observed in other non-pathogenic Pseudomonas spp. previously, this is the first report indicating that a T 3 SS in a Pseudomonas sp. is highly similar to the one from Salmonella spp...|$|E
30|$|One of {{the light}} blue beads (Mag-eu-lb 25) is {{coloured}} with lazurite/ultramarine (Fig.  4 a, b) and opacified with antimony. Lazurite {{in the form of}} natural mineral was detected in Islamic ceramic glazes and glass from the thirteenth–fifteenth century AD [40] but the synthetic form (ultramarine) was only in use since 1828 in Europe [41]. It is not possible to discriminate between the natural and synthetic forms of the pigment with the laser lines used, but the glass that the bead (lb 25) is made of has a high lead content (7.2 %) which differentiates it from the earlier beads series (before seventeenth century) from south Asia and the Middle East and is more similar to beads from the European series (Mag-eu-db 21 and Mag-eu-w 8) with low lead content. Mag-eu-db 1 is a low aluminium and high calcium glass with cobalt used as colourant. The associated elements with <b>cobalt</b> are nickel, <b>arsenate</b> (Co/As =  0.4) and bismuth (432.69  ppm), while cobalt blue from east of the Euphrates (such as cobalt in Zhizo beads) shows a higher ratio of Co/As (> 1) or is associated with a high iron and low manganese content (Mn/Fe <  0.1) as found in Jingdezhen glazes [29, 30]. Mag-eu-lb 1 and Mag-eu-lb 3 have the same glass composition as Mag-eu-db 1 and some of the white European beads (Mag-eu-w 5 - 7 - 10) without Ni, As, and Bi that are associated with cobalt. These beads all contain low Fe, Ti and high Sr (Table  2).|$|R
30|$|The arsenic {{content in}} the smalt {{analyses}} in Table  5 is considerable, in most cases far exceeding that of cobalt. The most common <b>cobalt</b> ores were <b>arsenates</b> and arsenides, found in the deposits in Saxony that were until the eighteenth century the only source in Europe of cobalt, and typically also containing small amounts of nickel, iron and bismuth. The ore was prepared by first roasting it to {{remove some of the}} arsenic. It is clear from the analyses that the degree to which this was done was variable, as evident from the Co/As ratios in Table  5, which allow distinction between variations due to differences in the roasting and those due simply to the amount of cobalt ore that was used. In most cases the amount of cobalt is around half that of arsenic, but the smalt in the Adoration by Breughel is instead rather low in arsenic, with the amount of cobalt being more than twice as much. Clearer trends are likely to become evident as more results become available; it is interesting that a recent study of smalt in paintings by Titian and Veronese in the National Gallery showed these to all be rich in arsenic [46]. Arsenic can act as either a network modifier or former in the glass. From the few initial studies by Raman and FTIR microscopy it seems to be behaving as the latter in smalt [44], and in the melt it can also function as a fining agent. Differences in the arsenic content in smalt may therefore be of significance and indicate deliberate choices in the preparation of the ore that manufacturers had discovered would improve the quality of the product, although {{further research is needed to}} understand this fully.|$|R
