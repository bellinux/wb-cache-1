5|$|The 193d Special Operations Wing (193 SOW) is an Air National Guard (ANG) unit, operationally {{gained by}} AFSOC, and located at Harrisburg International Airport/Air National Guard Station (former Olmsted Air Force Base), Pennsylvania. Under Title 32 USC, the 193 SOW {{performs}} state missions for the Governor of Pennsylvania {{as part of}} the Pennsylvania Air National Guard. Under Title 10 USC, the 193 SOW is part of the Air Reserve Component (ARC) of the United States Air Force. Its primary wartime and contingency operations mission as an AFSOC-gained unit is psychological operations (PSYOP). The 193 SOW is unique in that it is the only unit in the U.S. Air Force to fly and maintain the Lockheed EC-130J <b>Commando</b> <b>Solo</b> aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The 193d Special Operations Wing of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard {{deployed}} its EC-130 <b>Commando</b> <b>Solo</b> aircraft for {{a variety}} of PSYOPS support to coalition agencies in Iraq. Flying from March to June 2003, its missions apparently fulfilled their goals. According to an Iraqi prisoner of war and former mid-level intelligence officer, the population in southern Iraq considered the coalition radio broadcasts more truthful than state-owned media. The leaflets also {{had a significant impact on}} the morale of Iraqi military and prompted considerations to surrender. The Iraqis concluded that U.S. planes could as easily target them with bombs as leaflets if their intent was lethal.|$|E
25|$|The Air Force {{received}} 10 RC-121C and 74 EC-121D Warning Stars {{also based}} on the L-1049 beginning with diversions from the Navy contracts in October 1953. The 10 RC-121Cs became trainers, designated TC-121C. Between 1966 and 1969, 30 retired Navy EC-121s were transferred to the USAF and converted in EC-121Rs as sensor-monitoring aircraft. Of the 74 EC-121s, 42 were converted to the EC-121H upgrade beginning in 1962, and in 1969, 15 of the remaining EC-121Ds and seven of the EC-121Hs were further upgraded into the final operational variant, the EC-121T, which served as an AWACS prototype in Southeast Asia in 1972. Five EC-121Ds were modified to be broadcasting aircraft for psychological warfare operations, the predecessors of the EC-130 <b>Commando</b> <b>Solo.</b>|$|E
50|$|Michelle Heart makes {{appearance}} in the fighting game Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes as one of several support characters who assist the main fighters in combat. She also appears as a trading card in SNK's Card Fighters series. In the tactical role-playing game Namco x Capcom, the character of Sylphie (the shopkeeper from Forgotten Worlds) dresses up as Michelle Heart when she performs one of her special attacks. Michelle Heart is also featured in Project X Zone 2 as a cameo character in Captain <b>Commando's</b> <b>Solo</b> Unit attack.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, Solo and Kuryakin are {{approached}} by Alexander Waverly, a high-ranking MI6 operative who flies {{them on a}} Westland Wessex to HMS Ark Royal (R09) and reveals that Gaby is an undercover agent under his employment. He and his Special Boat Service <b>commandos</b> help <b>Solo</b> and Kuryakin infiltrate the Vinciguerras’ compound. Alexander Vinciguerra attempts to escape with Gaby and the warhead, but is intercepted and Alexander is killed by the duo. Solo secretly retrieves the disc with Teller’s research, but the warhead Vinciguerra was taking with him was the non-nuclear secondary missile, allowing Victoria to leave undetected on another boat with the real warhead. By Gaby's suggestion, having heard the weapon system explained, Solo is able to contact Victoria via radio and keep her on the line long enough for Waverly to locate her and launch the homing missile, simultaneously destroying the nuclear weapon and the boat, apparently taking Victoria with it.|$|R
2500|$|By March 2002, ANG C-130 units {{had flown}} 55 {{percent of the}} {{missions}} for the Afghanistan war. [...] The 193d Special Operations Wing of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard, using the EC-130E <b>Commando</b> <b>Solo</b> aircraft, performed an unusual mission in Afghanistan: psychological operations (PSYOPS). Since 1968, the 193d had been handling airborne psychological operations missions. The EC-130E acquired the mission name <b>Commando</b> <b>Solo</b> during the 1990s, when the aircraft was modified to handle color television operations. One of the first ANG flying units deployed to the area, the 193d began transmitting {{by the end of}} October 2001. For almost six months the unit relayed broadcasts of Voice of America in the Dari and Pashtu languages and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in Uzbek, Tajik, and Persian. According to a White House spokesman, the <b>Commando</b> <b>Solo</b> missions gave the Afghan people [...] "full knowledge about what is happening in Afghanistan from a source other than a repressive Taliban regime." [...] The 193d remained in the region until ground psychological warfare operations stations were safely established.|$|E
2500|$|The Air Force Special Operations Training Center {{conducted}} the initial MC-130J training program {{in conjunction with}} the Pennsylvania Air National Guard's 193rd Special Operations Wing, using its four EC-130J <b>Commando</b> <b>Solo</b> aircraft to develop the training syllabus for MC-130J aircrew members. The MC-130J operates with a 5-member crew, eliminating the CSO navigator and the enlisted flight engineer positions that had been in the Combat Shadow's crew, with the remaining CSO handling electronic warfare as well as the navigation and aerial refueling duties formerly conducted by the navigator and flight engineer. [...] The 415th Special Operations Squadron, a unit of the 58th Operations Group at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, was reactivated on 22 September 2011 as the main training unit for both MC-130J and HC-130J Combat King II crews.|$|E
50|$|The EC-130E <b>Commando</b> <b>Solo</b> entered {{service in}} 1978 as the EC-130E Coronet Solo with the Tactical Air Command (TAC). In 1983 the Coronet Solo's mission was {{transferred}} to the Military Airlift Command (MAC) and redesignated the EC-130E Volant Solo. With the formation of Air Force Special Operations Command, the mission {{was transferred to}} AFSOC and redesignated <b>Commando</b> <b>Solo.</b> Operations were consolidated under a single-AFSOC gained unit, the 193d Special Operations Wing (193 SOW) of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard. In the early 1990s the aircraft were upgraded and designated <b>Commando</b> <b>Solo</b> II. The EC-130E variants were replaced with new EC-130J <b>Commando</b> <b>Solo</b> III aircraft built by Lockheed Martin beginning in 2003.|$|E
50|$|The Air National Guard {{provides}} {{support for}} Psychological Operations using a modified C-130 Hercules aircraft named EC-130 <b>COMMANDO</b> <b>SOLO,</b> {{operated by the}} 193d Special Operations Wing. The purpose of <b>COMMANDO</b> <b>SOLO</b> is to provide an aerial platform for broadcast media on both television and radio. The media broadcast is created by various agencies and organizations. As part of the broader function of information operations, <b>COMMANDO</b> <b>SOLO</b> can also jam the enemy's broadcasts to his own people, or his psychological warfare broadcasting.|$|E
50|$|Secondary {{missions}} include {{command and}} control communications countermeasures (C3CM) and limited intelligence gathering. The three variants are EC-130 ABCCC, EC-130E <b>Commando</b> <b>Solo,</b> and the EC-130J <b>Commando</b> <b>Solo.</b> The version currently in service is the EC-130J, as the last EC-130E was retired from service in 2006.|$|E

[...] In 1992, the 193 SOW received its first EC-130E upgraded to <b>Commando</b> <b>Solo</b> II configuration. In 1994, the <b>Commando</b> <b>Solo</b> II aircraft were used to broadcast radio and TV messages to the citizens and leaders of Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy. President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was featured in these broadcasts, which contributed to the orderly transition from military rule to democracy.|$|E
50|$|A {{challenge}} to <b>COMMANDO</b> <b>SOLO</b> {{is the increasing}} use of cable television, which will not receive signals from airborne, ground, or any other transmitters that the cable operator does not want to connect to the system. At best, in the presence of cable TV, <b>COMMANDO</b> <b>SOLO</b> may be able to jam enemy broadcasts that are not, themselves, transmitted by cable.|$|E

In 1998, the unit and its aircraft participated in Operation Desert Thunder, a deployment to Southwest Asia to convince Iraq to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions. The <b>Commando</b> <b>Solo</b> II was again sent into action in 1999 in support of Operation Allied Force. The aircraft was tasked to broadcast radio and television into Kosovo to prevent ethnic cleansing and assist in the expulsion of the Serbs from the region. In 2001, the <b>Commando</b> <b>Solo</b> II aircraft broadcast messages to the local Afghan population and Taliban soldiers during Operation Enduring Freedom.|$|E
