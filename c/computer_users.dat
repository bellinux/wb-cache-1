Hawes {{called a}} meeting of representatives from academia, <b>computer</b> <b>users,</b> and {{manufacturers}} at the University of Pennsylvania to organize a formal meeting on common business languages.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, <b>computer</b> <b>users</b> and {{manufacturers}} were becoming {{concerned about the}} rising cost of programming. A 1959 survey had found that in any data processing installation, the programming cost US$800,000 on average and that translating programs to run on new hardware would cost $600,000. At a time when new programming languages were proliferating at an ever-increasing rate, the same survey suggested that if a common business-oriented language were used, conversion would be far cheaper and faster.|$|E

This may be facilitated by careful planning and implementation of <b>computer</b> <b>user</b> training as part of the systems development process. Although much research has focused on user involvement in the development of applications and the impact of this involvement on user satisfaction and system usage, little research has been done on the relationships between <b>computer</b> <b>user</b> training and user involvement, user satisfaction, or system usage. Using 282 survey responses, this article explores the relationships of <b>computer</b> <b>user</b> training to user involvement, user satisfaction, user confidence, and system usage.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore and {{describe}} the organizational structure of <b>computer</b> <b>user</b> groups and what roles they play in adult computer learning. The research consisted of two stages that used triangulation methodology. The pilot study involved a survey, which used a 34 item questionnaire, answered by 128 persons. The second stage consisted of a nationwide survey, which used a 57 item questionnaire, telephone interviews, and content analysis of newsletters. The nationwide survey was answered by 72 groups, representing 55, 222 members. Findings 1. <b>Computer</b> <b>user</b> groups were a major provider of computer learning for adults in the United States. 2. <b>Computer</b> <b>user</b> groups were one form of autonomous learning groups. 3. <b>Computer</b> <b>user</b> groups existed in all parts of the United States and tended to have a formal organization. 4. Members of <b>computer</b> <b>user</b> groups were typically over 35, had a high family income, were college graduates, and were male. 5. Members of <b>computer</b> <b>user</b> groups preferred self-directed learning and peer led learning to classes at educational institutions. Recommendations 1. Adult and community educators should study other autonomous learning groups to discover the role that they play in adult learning. 2. Practical research should be conducted to determine if and how educational institutions can best assist autonomous learning groups. 3. Adult and community education practitioners should survey their local communities to identify autonomous learning groups and determine methods that can be used to cooperate with these groups. 4. Adult and community educators should identify local <b>computer</b> <b>user</b> groups and determine how their educational institutions could cooperate with <b>computer</b> <b>user</b> groups. 5. More innovative programming should be conducted by adult and community educators that takes advantage of the learning model provided by <b>computer</b> <b>user</b> groups. 6. Training and development personnel should examine the potential benefits of implementing <b>computer</b> <b>user</b> groups and other autonomous learning groups within their organizations to promote learning new knowledge and skills. ConclusionComputer user groups were organized primarily to assist their members in learning more about computers. In addition to satisfying the learning needs of members, the groups provided supplemental services that supported other computer related needs of the members. <b>Computer</b> <b>user</b> groups were one form of autonomous learning groups and the results of this study suggested that the role of such groups in adult learning may be far more important than was generally recognized by adult and community educators.
