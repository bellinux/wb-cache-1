5000|$|The term [...] "gene" [...] {{can refer}} to a locus (location) on an organism's DNA—a section that codes for a {{particular}} trait. Alternative versions of the code at that location are called [...] "alleles." [...] If there are two alleles at a locus, one of which codes for altruism {{and the other for}} selfishness, an individual who has one of each {{is said to be a}} heterozygote at that locus. If the heterozygote uses half of its resources raising its own offspring and the other half helping its siblings raise theirs, that condition is called <b>codominance.</b> If there is <b>codominance</b> the [...] "2" [...] in the above argument is exactly 2.|$|E
5000|$|A similar {{situation}} arises from <b>codominance,</b> {{in which the}} phenotypes produced by both alleles are clearly expressed.

Heterozygous chickens have a color described as [...] "erminette", speckled with black and white feathers. Unlike the blending of red and white colors in heterozygous four o'clocks, black and white colors appear separately in chickens. Many human genes, including one for a protein that controls cholesterol levels in the blood, show <b>codominance,</b> too. People with the heterozygous form of this gene produce two different forms of the protein, each with a different effect on cholesterol levels.|$|E

When organisms are heterozygous at a gene, often one allele is called dominant as its qualities dominate the phenotype of the organism, while the other allele is called recessive as its qualities recede and are not observed.

40|$|Four crosses {{were made}} between inbred Cannabis sativa plants with pure {{cannabidiol}} (CBD) and pure Delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) chemotypes. All the plants {{belonging to the}} F(1) 's were analyzed by gas chromatography for cannabinoid composition and constantly {{found to have a}} mixed CBD-THC chemotype. Ten individual F(1) plants were self-fertilized, and 10 inbred F(2) offspring were collected and analyzed. In all cases, a segregation of the three chemotypes (pure CBD, mixed CBD-THC, and pure THC) fitting a 1 : 2 : 1 proportion was observed. The CBD/THC ratio was found to be significantly progeny specific and transmitted from each F(1) to the F(2) 's derived from it. A model involving one locus, B, with two alleles, B(D) and B(T), is proposed, with the two alleles being codominant. The mixed chemotypes are interpreted as due to the genotype B(D) /B(T) at the B locus, while the pure-chemotype plants are due to homozygosity at the B locus (either B(D) /B(D) or B(T) /B(T)). It is suggested that such <b>codominance</b> is due to the codification by the two alleles for different isoforms of the same synthase, having different specificity for the conversion of the common precursor cannabigerol into CBD or THC, respectively. The F(2) segregating groups were used in a bulk segregant analysis of the pooled DNAs for screening RAPD primers; three chemotype-associated markers are described, one of which has been transformed in a sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker and shows tight linkage to the chemotype and <b>codominance...</b>|$|E

40|$|Savanna {{ecosystems}} {{have long}} fascinated ecologists {{due to the}} <b>codominance</b> of trees and grasses. This <b>codominance</b> is often explained by the vertical juxtaposition of rooting depths leading to niche separation for water uptake. The tree–grass spatial patterns observed are often investigated within the competition, disturbance, and resource heterogeneity framework. Ecohydrologic studies are developing models to describe patterns based on this framework and the complex interplay between climate, soil moisture, and resource heterogeneity. A common impediment to unraveling {{the relative importance of}} each of these factors is a lack of detailed spatial and temporal data describing resource heterogeneity. In this research, we investigated the use of electromagnetic-induction (EMI) imaging as a way of determining soil spatial resource heterogeneity. The aim was to determine if EMI signal response, reflecting soil texture and moisture, can provide a rapid method for identifying soil spatial resource heterogeneity, thus providing a novel method to help differentiate between the importance of competition, disturbance, and resource heterogeneity in controlling tree–grass pattern development. We found a significant difference (t = 10. 18, P = 1. 57 x 10 – 21) between signal response under grass and trees. Higher bulk soil electrical conductivity (ECa) values occurred under grass (32 mS m– 1), indicating more clay, while lower ECa values (21 mS m– 1) occurred under trees where clay content was less. Significant ECa differences were also observed between the oak (Quercus spp.) and buckeye [Aesculus californica (Spach) Nutt. ] tree communities, but not between the evergreen and deciduous oak communities. Soil ECa provides a rapid measurement method to identify soil resource heterogeneity in savanna tree–grass systems and could provide a vital tool for woodland restoration planning. ...|$|E

40|$|Neutral {{models of}} {{speciation}} based on isolation by distance and assortative mating, termed topopatric, have {{shown to be}} successful in describing abundance distributions and species-area relationships. Previous works have considered this type of process in the context of haploid genomes.

In the case of complete dominance, we observe that speciation requires stronger spatial inbreeding in comparison to the haploid model. For perfect <b>codominance,</b> instead, speciation demands stronger genetic assortativeness. Nevertheless, once speciation is established, the three models predict the same abundance distributions even at the quantitative level, revealing the robustness of the original mechanism to describe biodiversity features...|$|E

40|$|International audienceRecent {{theoretical}} {{advances have}} suggested that various forms of balancing selection may promote the evolution of dominance through an increase of the proportion of heterozygote genotypes. We test whether dominance can evolve in the sporophytic selfincompatibility (SSI) system in plants. SSI prevents mating between individuals expressing identical SI phenotypes by recognition of pollen by pistils, which avoids selfing and inbreeding depression. SI phenotypes depend on a complex network of dominance relationships between alleles at the self-incompatibility locus (S-locus). Empirical studies suggest that these relationships are not random, but the exact evolutionary processes shaping these relationships remain unclear. We investigate the expected patterns of dominance under the hypothesis that dominance is a direct target of natural selection. We follow {{the fate of a}} mutant allele at the S-locus whose dominance relationships are changed but whose specificity remains unaltered. We show that strict <b>codominance</b> is not evolutionarily stable in SSI, and that inbreeding depression due to deleterious mutations linked or unlinked to the S-locus exerts strong constraints on changes in relative levels of dominance in pollen and pistil.
