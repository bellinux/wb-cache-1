40|$|Objective. : Previous {{studies show}} that {{arthralgia}} {{is the most common}} symptom experienced by Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors. Nevertheless, specific analyses of rheumatological sequelea are still lacking. Methods. : The Postebogui study is a prospective, multicentre cohort aiming to evaluate the long-term outcomes of EVD survivors infected during the 2014 - 15 outbreak in Guinea. Of the 216 participants enrolled in the study in October 2015, 44 patients with arthralgia/myalgia underwent a physical examination by a rheumatologist (the Eborheum cohort). Data were collected using a standardized questionnaire. Results. : In the Eborheum cohort, 61 % of patients were female, the median age was 31. 1 years, and the median time from Ebola Treatment <b>Centre</b> <b>discharge</b> was 8. 8 months. Pain manifestation started after Ebola infection in all but one patient. Patients had mainly both mechanical and inflammatory pain (45 %) and low back pain (77 %). All patients reported pain in at least one peripheral joint. Pain in large joints was more frequently reported than in small joints (73 vs 41 %). Oligo- and polyarticular presentations were similar, with symmetrical pain distribution. Furthermore, 36 patients had at least one painful 18 -tender point count, most of whom reported extensive pain (n = 19) and symmetrical distribution (91 %). Diagnoses were mainly non-specific musculoskeletal disorders (59 %) and mechanical back pain (52 %). No polyarthritis was observed. We found a higher percentage of depressed patients compared with the remaining Postebogui group (42 vs 11 %; P < 0. 001). Conclusion. : Results from the study come from the first complete rheumatological examination of a cohort of EVD survivors, nearly 9 months after Ebola Treatment <b>Centre</b> <b>discharge.</b> Importantly, we found that patients with arthralgia/myalgia included in the Eborheum cohort were more likely to experience depression than survivors not reporting these symptoms, highlighting the impact of pain symptoms among survivors...|$|E
40|$|Interaction between drugs {{constitutes}} a frequent cause of adverse drug reaction. The {{aim of this}} study, was to provide an analysis of potential drug interactions. The study groups were 225 patients from the dialysis unit and 519 patients from the heart failure <b>centre.</b> <b>Discharge</b> prescriptions from the two units were collected for six months during 2011. In the heart failure centre, 74 % of patients received prescriptions for drug combinations that may have adverse interactions. The most frequent and important potential interactions concerned furosemide with enalapril, 17 %, and acetylsalicylic acid with metoprolol, 15 %. In the dialysis unit, 19 % of patients received prescriptions that may have adverse interactions.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundProgress in {{techniques}} and equipment facilitates same-day-discharge percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). AimTo present initial {{experience of a}} same-day-discharge intention-to-treat ad hoc PCI strategy with a preferentially radial approach. MethodsThe first 102  same-day-discharge PCIs performed in our centre were analysed retrospectively. Subjects were stable or stabilised coronary patients, free of cardiac insufficiency, with a normal Allen test and residing within 60 min of the <b>centre.</b> <b>Discharge</b> was authorised after six hours’ event-free monitoring. The principal assessment criterion combined major adverse cardiovascular events, stroke, major haemorrhage and unscheduled medical consultation in the 30  days following PCI. Overall patient satisfaction and anxiety associated with same-day discharge were assessed by telephone questionnaire at some time after the intervention. ResultsBetween January 2006 and March 2008, 95  day-hospital patients underwent 102  distinct PCIs (50  complex, 13  bifurcation lesions, nine intravascular ultrasound, 18  fractional flow reserve, two Rotablator procedures). Crossover to overnight admission was necessary for 5. 9 % (n= 6) of interventions. Baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics {{were similar to those}} of an unselected Western population. At 30  days, four clinical events were observed (3. 9 % of interventions), which occurred within 6 hours (n= 2) or after the 24 th hour. Classical 24 -hour admission would thus have provided no added benefit. On an analogue scale, overall satisfaction was high (8. 9 / 10) and anxiety associated with same-day discharge was low (1. 7 / 10). ConclusionA same-day-discharge ad hoc PCI strategy proved reliable and safe for most patients selected a priori on simple clinical criteria, entailing no unexpected complications due to shorter medical monitoring...|$|E

40|$|International audienceNitriding {{treatments}} using various (Ar–N 2 –H 2) gas mixtures {{are performed}} on thin molybdenum films coated on Si (100) substrates, in an expanding microwave plasma reactor. The electron density measured in (Ar– 25 %N 2 – 30 %H 2) and (Ar– 8 %N 2 – 10 %H 2) plasma {{as well as}} the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) vary with the distance from the <b>centre</b> of the <b>discharge</b> and are large compared to the corresponding parameters found in (Ar– 30 %N 2 – 12 %H 2) gas mixture and pure N 2 gas. In such ternary gas mixtures, the mean electron energy ranges between 0. 5 and 0. 7 eV. A nitride compound of tetragonal-like structure is formed in the whole film thickness of molybdenum heated at 873 K and exposed to (Ar– 25 %N 2 – 30 %H 2) and (Ar– 8 %N 2 – 10 %H 2) gas mixtures for exposure times of 20 min duration. It consists of small columnar grains ranging in size from 20 to 30 nm in the growth direction. The nitrogen diffusion profiles are fitted to the Fick's second law by introducing a diffusion coefficient ranging between 5 × 10 − 10 and 5 × 10 − 9 cm 2 s− 1 within the accuracy of the method. The diffusion coefficient found from previous measured pressure transients is equal to about 10 − 10 cm 2 s− 1. The plasma composition {{as well as the}} distance from the <b>centre</b> of the <b>discharge</b> seems to play a role on the reduction of oxides, only. An (Ar– 25 %N 2 – 30 %H 2) nitriding treatment carried out at 8 cm from the <b>centre</b> of the <b>discharge</b> leads to oxide amount twice lower than the one measured after an (Ar– 8 %N 2 – 10 %H 2) nitriding treatment carried out at 12 cm from the <b>centre</b> of the <b>discharge.</b> Because of the low ion energies, the reduction of oxides is probably mainly confined to hydrogen species...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{dynamics}} of neutral gas depletion in high-density plasmas is investigated by time- and space-resolved {{measurements of the}} xenon ground state density. Two-photon absorbed laser induced fluorescence experiments were carried out in a helicon reactor operating at 10 mTorr in xenon gas. When the plasma is magnetized, a plasma column is formed {{from the bottom of}} the chamber up to the pumping region. In this situation it is found that two phenomena, with different time scales, are responsible for the neutral gas depletion. The magnetized plasma column is ignited in a short (millisecond) time scale leading to a neutral gas depletion at the <b>discharge</b> <b>centre</b> and to an increase of neutral gas density at the reactor walls. This is explained both by neutral gas heating and by the rise of the plasma pressure at the <b>discharge</b> <b>centre.</b> Then, on a much longer (second) time scale, the overall neutral gas density in the reactor decreases due to higher pumping efficiency when the magnetized plasma column is ignited. The pumping enhancement is not observed when the plasma is not magnetized, probably because in this case the dense plasma column vanishes and the plasma is more localized near the antenna...|$|R

These mills are used in at least three industries: mining, cement and metal powders industries to grind different materials (ore, clinker and metal powder) to desired quality specifications as principally described by a size distribution. These tumbling mills range in size from small 0. 3 m diameter lab mills to a 16 m diameter semi-autogenous industrial mill and are driven by chain and sprocket (lab mills), gear and pinion (pilot and industrial scale mills) and gearless drives in very large diameter mill (8 to 12 m dia.).

40|$|Runaway {{generation}} {{during a}} major disruption {{has been observed}} in TEXTOR. Measurements of the synchrotron radiation yielded number, energy and pitch angle of the runaways. A simple model, which assumes that the runaways take over the current density in the <b>centre</b> of the <b>discharge,</b> successfully describes these measurements. This model is applied to JET and ITER. One interesting result of the model is {{that it could be}} favourable for ITER to have a high runaway production. This leads to a lower runaway energy and less runaway damage. Quantitative predications are sensitive to the value of the runaway parameter epsilon - E/E-crit, which is determined by the post-disruption temperature. The present estimate for ITER gives epsilon = 0. 02, which results in a maximum runaway energy of 300 MeV in a runaway beam with a total energy of 500 MJ. However, if epsilon is enhanced, these values will be reduced. An increase to epsilon = 0. 04 is sufficient to decrease the maximum runaway energy to 55 MeV and the total beam energy to 130 MJ.

40|$|Fever is {{frequent}} in neutropenic {{patients and}} often related to infection. Two major concepts, {{have contributed to}} the marked mortality decrease of those patients {{by the end of the}} 1960 s: firstly, the duration and severity of neutropenia were the most important variables linked to infection and secondly, prompt administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials empirically, was life-saving. At the same time it was universally admitted that a careful daily examination of all portals of entry for micro-organisms was mandatory and that laboratory and imaging investigations were needed at regular intervals, keeping constantly in mind the individual type and stage of immunosuppression. Through many studies, paediatricians contributed markedly in standardisation of management of febrile neutropenic patients. Neutropenic patients are not equally prone to infections, partly due to the underlying cancer, chemotherapy and co-morbidity factors. Neutropenic children are not only vulnerable to bacteria, fungi and viruses commonly encountered in adults, but also to common viruses and bacteria. Very few studies included a viral work-up. Epidemiological new trends are observed: Gram-positive bacteria and fungi are on the rise. Simplifying and shortening antibiotic regimens were made possible because new potent antibiotics were launched. Since the mid- 1980 s, many paediatric <b>centres</b> commonly <b>discharge</b> patients before complete bone marrow recovery, provided that patients meet certain low-risk criteria and do not exhibit any clinical or biological evidence of bacterial infection. However, a few prospective randomised studies have been conducted for assessing the safety of early antibiotics discontinuation and safe early discharge. The choice of oral agents up to now was complicated by the reluctance using fluoroquinolones in children. New challenges are numerous in terms of diagnostic tools, detection of epidemiological trends and emerging pathogens, identification and control of nosocomial threats including drug resistance, assessment of the real impact of prophylaxis, evaluation of new agents, the need for more accurate risk scoring systems, outpatient management and the necessity for an optimal use of resources.

40|$|Time {{resolved}} Thomson scattering (TS) measurements {{have been}} performed on an ac driven high pressure mercury lamp. For this high intensity discharge (HID) lamp, TS is coherent and a coherent fitting routine, including rotational Raman calibration, {{was used to determine}} ne and Te from the measured spectrum. The maximum electron density and electron temperature obtained in the <b>centre</b> of the <b>discharge</b> varied in a time period of 5 ms between 1 × 1021 m- 3 2 ̆ 6 lt;ne 2 ̆ 6 lt; 5 × 1021 m- 3 and 6500 K 2 ̆ 6 lt;Te 2 ̆ 6 lt; 7100 K. In order to test the non-intrusive character of TS, we have derived a general expression for the heating of the electrons. By applying this to our mercury lamp and laser settings, we have confirmed the non-intrusiveness of our method. This is supported by the experimental findings. Furthermore, because the TS results were obtained directly, thus, without the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumptions, they enabled us to follow the deviations from LTE as a function of time. Contrary to the generally made assumption that HID lamps are in LTE, we have found deviations from both the thermal and chemical equilibrium inside the high pressure mercury lamp at different phases of the applied current...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{ignition}} {{phase and}} {{the transition to}} quasi DC glow operation of a narrow-gap near atmospheric pressure discharge in hydrogen are investigated experimentally. The discharge is ignited by a short 10 ns voltage pulse with a peak voltage of 1. 3 kV followed by a 150 ns plateau of about 350 V. Pulsing is at 12 kHz which leaves {{a significant amount of}} residual charge between the individual pulses. Temporally resolved laser electric field measurement in the <b>centre</b> of the <b>discharge</b> employing a non-linear four-wave mixing scheme, ultra-high speed optical imaging by an ICCD camera at Balmer-alpha and Fulcher lines as well as the undispersed emission, and current and voltage measurements are performed. Special emphasis is put on a detailed analysis of the measured data by combining the results from the various diagnostics. This allows in addition to the directly measured quantities determination of the absolute evolution of the electron density, the development of space charge shielding, and the observation of the local electron dynamics. Pressure variations in a limited range indicate reasonable agreement with the Paschen law but raise also questions on the definition of the break down voltage under highly transient conditions. 2 Atmospheric pressure discharges under small spatial dimensions, so called microplasmas, have attracted large attention in recent years. On one hand large expectations on industrial applications exists while on the other hand the physics is often complex and difficult to investigate. In particular diagnostics is a challenge since most of the tools and techniques developed over decades for low-pressure, large scale discharges can not be applied here. Many types of microplasmas operate in pulsed mode and the transient phase of their ignition is even more difficult to access by adding to the already microscopic dimensions also fast temporal changes on ns or sub-ns timescales. Here an experimental investigation of the rapid ignition phase and the subsequent transition to quasi-DC operation in a molecular gas (hydrogen) is reported. The geometry is one-dimensional to allow a simple interpretation. The main parameters determined directly are the discharge voltage, the current density, the electric field in the <b>centre</b> of the <b>discharge,</b> and the spatially and temporally resolved emission. First successful application of these diagnostics to a similar setup was reported in [1 - 3]. Here we go beyond by more detailed studies and in particular a careful analysis and interpretation of the data. From the combination of the directly measured quantities with simple and robust models further insight in the ignition dynamics is provided. The temporal evolution of absolute electron densities is obtained and spatial and temporal development of different groups of low and highly energetic electrons is observed...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} protein enriched bread and drinking yoghurt, substituting regular products, on the total protein intake {{and the distribution of}} protein intake over the day in older adults. Design A single blind randomised controlled trial. Setting Rehabilitation centre. Participants Older adults (≥ 55 years) admitted to a rehabilitation <b>centre</b> after hospital <b>discharge</b> (n= 34). Intervention Participants received a high protein diet (protein enriched bread and protein enriched drinking yoghurt; n= 17) or a regular diet (regular bread and regular drinking yoghurt; n= 17) for three consecutive weeks. Measurements Total protein intake and protein intake per meal, measured twice weekly over a three weeks period (six measurements per participant). Results Compared with controls, patients who received the protein enriched products had a significantly higher protein intake (115. 3 g/d vs 72. 5 g/d, P< 0. 001; 1. 6 g/kg/d vs 1. 1 g/kg/d, P< 0. 001). The intervention group consumed quantities over the recommended level (25 – 30 g/meal) during each of the three meals (32. 5 g, 30. 0 g, 34. 8 g/meal), where the control group consumed quantities below the recommended level during breakfast (17. 7 g) and lunch (18. 4 g). Conclusions The use of protein enriched products, replacing regular products, results in a significant increased daily protein intake in older adults. In addition, the daily consumption of protein enriched products improves protein distribution over the day...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{importance}} of controlling Reproductive Tract Infection / Sexually transmitted Infection (RTI/STI) has increased, as even single sexual exposure, {{the risk of}} becoming HIV infected 10 - 30 folds {{in the presence of}} geni-tal ulcers. But personal variables like perception of the client about the disease determine the treatment seeking behaviour. Objective: To determine the socio-demographic determinants of married Muslim women, their hygiene practice followed during menstruation; and to explore factors influencing care seeking behaviour for abnormal vaginal discharge. Methodology: Community based cross sectional study, target population: married Muslim women in the reproductive age group (15 - 49 years). Study unit: Each woman attending the Out Door Patient (OPD) for any reason; sample size: 100 Results: Fifty four percent respondents mentioned that they do not take bath at all during menstrual flow, most common reason mentioned was Gunah (40. 7 %). The lower abdominal pain is the most significant symptoms by which women has self reported to the health centre for consultation (chi sq= 16. 174, P< 0. 000), followed by backache (chi square= 9. 002, p< 0. 002) and increase in vaginal discharge (Chi sq = 8. 009, P< 0. 005. In reference to sharing and visiting the health <b>centre</b> for vaginal <b>discharge</b> as a primary complaint, husband role is significant. Conclusion: It is concluded that ignorance and socio cultural factors restricts the women to seek health care for problems related to reproductive health. Women also need counselling fo...|$|R
40|$|Recovering {{energy from}} exhaust air systems is an {{innovative}} idea. A specific {{wind turbine generator}} has been designed {{in order to achieve}} this goal. This device consists of two Giromill vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) combined with four guide vanes and two diffuser plates. The working principle of this design was simulated using the ANSYS Fluent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package and the results were compared to the experimental ones. The result shows that the optimum position of wind turbine that produces the highest power is when the shaft of the turbine is shifted 150 mm from the <b>centre</b> of <b>discharge</b> outlet. The theoretical analysis also shows that the turbine produces highest power at this position because the positive torque area of the turbine match the highest wind velocity from the cooling tower model. It was perceived from the results that by introducing the diffusers and then the guide vanes, the overall power output of the wind turbine was improved by approximately 5 % and 34 %, respectively, compared to using VAWT alone. In the case of the diffusers, the optimum angle was found to be 7 °, while for guide vanes A and B, it was 70 ° and 60 ° respectively. These results were in good agreement with experimental results obtained in the previous experimental study. Overall, it can be concluded that exhaust air recovery turbines are a promising form of green technology. The optimization was carried out in the next step. It was aimed to optimize the overall system energy generation and simultaneously guarantee that it does not violate the cooling tower performance in terms of decreasing airflow intake and increasing fan motor power consumption. The variable factors for the optimization are the wind turbine rotor position, modifying diffuser plates, and the introduction of separator plates to the design. The generated power coefficient was selected as optimization objective. Unlike most of previous optimizations in the field of wind turbines, response surface methodology (RSM) as a method of analytical procedures optimization has been utilised in this study by using multivariate statistic techniques. Both computational and optimization results were validated by experimental data obtained in the laboratory. Results showed that the optimization strategy could improve the wind turbine generated power by 48. 6 % compared to baseline design. Meanwhile, it is able to enhance the fan intake airflow rate and decrease fan motor power consumption. The obtained optimization equations were also validated by both CFD and experimental results and a very good agreement is achieved...|$|R
