40|$|A growing push to {{implement}} <b>catch</b> share fishery programs is based {{partly on the}} recognition that they may provide stronger incentives for ecological stewardship than conventional fisheries management. Using data on population status, quota compliance, discard rates, use of habitat-damaging gear, and landings for 15 <b>catch</b> share programs in North America, I tested the hypothesis that <b>catch</b> share systems lead to improved ecological stewardship and status of exploited populations. Impacts of <b>catch</b> share programs were measured through comparisons of fisheries with <b>catch</b> shares to fisheries without <b>catch</b> shares or by comparing fisheries before and after <b>catch</b> shares were implemented. The average levels of most indicators were unaffected by <b>catch</b> share implementation: only discard rate, which declined significantly in <b>catch</b> share fisheries, showed a significant response. However, <b>catch</b> share fisheries were distinguished by markedly reduced interannual variability in all indicators, being statistically significant for exploitation rate, landings, discard rate, and the ratio of <b>catch</b> to <b>catch</b> quotas. These impacts of <b>catch</b> shares were common between nations and ocean basins and were independent {{of the number of}} years that <b>catch</b> share programs had been in place. These findings suggest that for the indicators examined, the primary effect of <b>catch</b> shares was greater consistency over time. This enhanced consistency could be beneficial to fishery systems and might also be an indication of more effective management...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{stability}} of a fishery system was investigated using {{two forms of}} a stochastic computer simulation model that was individually based {{in terms of the}} fishing boats. Fish <b>catch</b> was partitioned among boats according to two <b>catch</b> processes: an unranked process in which all boats had equal ability to <b>catch</b> fish and a ranked <b>catch</b> model in which a boat’s ability to <b>catch</b> fish depended on its wealth. Stock size, total <b>catch,</b> fleet size and individual boat wealth were modeled over a series of years. In the unranked <b>catch</b> model the fish stock size and fleet size were significantly more variable than in the ranked <b>catch</b> model.

40|$|This {{document}} examines a <b>catch</b> rate {{series for}} the large coastal shark complex (LCS) and blacktip sharks calculated from a gillnet survey which was conducted in the Mississippi coastal waters from 1998 to 2005. As a result of 80 net sets and 354 hours of effort, 446 blacktip and 56 other LCS were collected. Because the work was conducted in a known blacktip nursery area, blacktip shark <b>catch</b> was further divided into young-of-the-young (YOY, age- 0) and juvenile <b>catch.</b> Standardized <b>catch</b> rates were estimated using a Generalized Linear Mixed modeling approach assuming a delta-lognormal error distribution and negative binomial regressions. <b>Catch</b> rates did not exhibit a clear pattern because of two years of extremely elevated <b>catch</b> rates in 2000 and 2005. The LCS <b>catch</b> rates exhibited similar patterns to total blacktip <b>catch,</b> primarily because blacktips dominated the LCS <b>catch.</b> There was some discussion as to what could account for these elevated <b>catch</b> rates. Because both YOY and juvenile <b>catch</b> rates were elevated and not reflected in subsequent years, {{it was suggested that}} these elevated <b>catch</b> rates resulted from sharks being concentrated within the study area. It was discussed that other factors should be investigated to help explain these elevated <b>catch</b> rates...|$|R
