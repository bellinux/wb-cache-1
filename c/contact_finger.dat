The ability to realize narrow contact fingers with very low silver consumption makes this technology particularly interesting for busbarless solar cells with wire-interconnection like Meyer Burger's SmartWire Connection Technology (SWCT). This study intends to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the general feasibility for this approach. Fundamental printing tests are carried out to investigate important influence parameters like the flexible printing plate and the correlation between printing pressure and <b>contact</b> <b>finger</b> width. We found out that <b>contact</b> <b>finger</b> elements on elastomer printing plates down to an actual width of wf = 7 ± 2 μm can be realized using a high-resolution laser-engraving process. Furthermore, we show that printed <b>contact</b> <b>finger</b> width increases by approx. Δwf ≈ 10 μm for each Δploc = 0. 05 MPa of pressure increase and thus has a strong impact on the contact grid. Busbarless Al BSF Cz-Si solar cells with flexo-printed front side metallization are fabricated and measured using Pasan GridTOUCH/SpotLIGHT-system. The best group of solar cells obtains a mean conversion efficiency of η = 19. 0 % and a maximum conversion efficiency of ηmax = 19. 4 %. A mini-module with the best two solar cells achieved a aperture conversion efficiency of η = 15. 8 %. Causes for cell-to-module losses are investigated and discussed in detail.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} methods to improve the efficiency of crystalline solar cells is the implementation of so-called selective emitters. This is the decoupling of the requirements for the front doping for light conversion and metallization.

Besides using costly and lengthy masking processes, selective emitters can be produced using lasers by means of laser doping. A laser beam with a suitable wavelength with good absorption in silicon is focused to a spot size which matches the width of the <b>contact</b> <b>fingers.</b> In this paper the process is explained, results are presented which show that the targeted effect can be achieved without detrimental "side effects", and an optical beam splitter technology for high throughput production is proposed...|$|R

Mainly focusing on large-size multitouch screens, existing solutions typically require {{at least three}} fingers and bimanual interaction for full 6 DOF manipulation. However, single-hand, two-finger operations are preferred especially for portable multitouch devices (e. g., popular smartphones) to cause less hand occlusion and relieve the other hand for necessary tasks like holding the devices. Our key idea for full 6 DOF control using only two <b>contact</b> <b>fingers</b> is to introduce two manipulation modes and two corresponding gestures by examining the moving characteristics of the two fingers, instead {{of the number of}} fingers or the directness of individual fingers as done in previous works.

Furthermore we present a new approach that allows for a quantitative separation of direct and indirect current conduction channels. For our experimental conditions, the assumption of current conduction exclusively by transport through silver crystallites adequately describes the experimental data.

The degradation behavior of cells, produced with different Ag seed-layer pastes resulting in different <b>contact</b> <b>finger</b> geometries after screen-printing and firing, was evaluated. With similar nickel diffusion barrier masses the seed-layer that generates the biggest metallized area at the cell surface shows the fastest degradation.

The formation of screen- or stencil-printed contact fingers is governed {{by a variety of}} influencing factors. One of these factors is the surface roughness of the textured silicon wafer. However, only a few investigations have been carried out to investigate this impact in detail. In this study, the influence of arithmetical mean roughness Ra of four differently textured wafer surfaces on <b>contact</b> <b>finger</b> geometry and lateral finger resistance, as well as optical and electrical losses, has been investigated. It will be shown that texture roughness has a considerable impact on the properties of the front-side grid. Narrower contact fingers could be realized on the smoothest texture, leading to a current density gain of Δjsc = + 0. 27 mA/cm 2. On the other hand, increasing texture roughness has affected the amount of transferred paste and, thus, has led to a lower lateral finger resistance RL. Thus, contact fingers on the roughest texture have benefited from a fill factor gain of ΔFF = + 0. 24 %abs.
