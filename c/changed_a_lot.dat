In 2006, this figure had increased to 14,630, so the non-Western {{immigrant population}} in Bergen was five times higher than in 1986.

During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have <b>changed</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E

25|$|The {{shooting}} lasted {{nearly twenty}} consecutive hours, {{and it was}} exhausting for Kalomira and for the team that worked {{under the guidance of}} director Kostas Kapetanidis. The director decided to focus {{on the face of the}} young performer and so chose to do the shoot in a studio and not outdoors. Sometimes alone, sometimes flanked by dancers, Kalomira danced and sang while wearing clothes selected from the collection of J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez. In some scenes of the video, impressive objects with bright colors such as a red Ducati motor bike, a huge disco ball, and big letters with the title of the song were used. The choreography was by Svitailof Ivan and the styling was George Segredaki and Constantine Koutsomichou while the hair and make-up were overseen by Dimitris Giannetos.

500|$|During the game's planning, it {{was decided}} that it should not be {{directly}} connected to Shin Megami Tensei, ensuring that it would hold interest independent from the first game; because of this, Kaneko envisioned it as a story loosely based on Shin Megami Tenseis future.

Kaneko disagreed, saying that culture would have <b>changed</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> over a hundred years, and that he could not even imagine what the world would look like a hundred years into the future or what it had been like during the Meiji period.

500|$|The {{music for}} Kingsglaive was {{composed}} by John R. Graham, with additional themes by Shimomura {{taken from her}} score for Final Fantasy XV.

Graham had previously contributed to the score of Square Enix's Bloodmasque and the 2014 film The Forger. For a few of Shimomura's pieces used in the film, the arrangement was altered to make it darker and add scale. Some tracks, such as [...] "Battle for the Crown City", <b>changed</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> during the score's development based on the scene it was set to within the film.

This was due to the story of the film revolving around Lucis' Crystal and the rules surrounding its magic, in addition to the story focusing on the differing reactions of people facing extraordinary circumstances.|$|E
