5000|$|Some meat {{markets will}} sell <b>cross-rib</b> pot roast under the generic name [...] "pot roast." [...] The {{difference}} between a pot roast and a <b>cross-rib</b> pot roast is the vertical line of fat separating {{the two types of}} chuck meat; the <b>cross-rib</b> pot roast contains the line of fat. This is what creates richness of flavor in the roast.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{boneless}} chuck cuts {{include the}} chuck eye (boneless cuts {{from the center}} of the roll, sold as mock tender steak or chuck tender steak), chuck fillet (sold as chuck eye steak and chuck tender steak,) <b>cross-rib</b> roast (sold as <b>cross-rib</b> pot roast, English roast, or [...] "the bread and butter cut"), top blade steak or chicken steak, under blade steak, shoulder steak and shoulder roast, and arm steak and arm roast.|$|E

5000|$|From the liwan rises the dome, {{built in}} the Lodi style, flanked by small minarets called guldastas (flower bouquets). The dome on the central bay has a kalash finial on top. There are also [...] "multiple openings" [...] in the [...] "drum" [...] for {{ventilation}} and is decorated with intricate tile work. The internal part of the mosque has five mihrabs, one in each bay, corresponding to the external facade. The mihrabs, with alternate fark and light coloured stones, are {{similar to that of}} the Atala Masjid in Jaunpur. Flat domes are present on the [...] "penultimate bays". The end bays are oblong in shape but the penultimate ones are square shaped. There are two half arches in the last bay which tangentially spring from the [...] "shoulders of lateral arches", resulting in the creation of three spaces spanned with a <b>cross-rib</b> arrangement. There is a shallow dome in the central space, whereas the eastern and western arcades have semi-domes called [...] "nim-gumbad" [...] which rest on [...] "suspending arches".|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} {{studies were}} conducted to investigate the forced convection and flow friction of a turbulent airflow in a horizontal air-cooled rectangular duct, with square-sectioned <b>cross-ribs</b> mounted on its bottom surface. Cross-sectional dimensions of the <b>cross-ribs</b> were 6. 37 mm × 6. 37 mm. Reynolds number of the fully turbulent flow was maintained constant at 12, 380. Heat was supplied uniformly to the airflow via bottom surface of the duct only. Effects of varying the angle formed by the <b>cross-ribs</b> between 30 ° and 120 ° on the forced convection and flow friction were studied. It was found that an optimum angle corresponding to the highest heat transfer coefficient occurred between 60 ° and 70 °. Computational predictions of forced convection and flow friction of the same rectangular duct mounted with <b>cross-ribs</b> were performed with the zonal k-ε model, the stability-guaranteed second-order difference scheme and the block implicit method. A comparison with the experimental results indicated that a reasonably good agreement had been achieved. Existence of an optimum angle formed by the <b>cross-ribs</b> between 60 ° and 70 ° was also indicated, except the numerical predictions were lower than the experimental findings by approximately 2 - 10 %. However, the flow friction had been slightly over-estimated by 2 - 11 % with the numerical model. It was shown that forced convection could be enhanced sufficiently by mounting <b>cross-ribs</b> on the internal surfaces of a rectangular duct, especially when the optimum angle was used.

50|$|Morchella anatolica is {{a species}} of ascomycete fungus in the family Morchellaceae that was {{described}} as new to science in 2010. It is found in Southwest Anatolia, Turkey, where it grows on moss-covered stream beds in pine forests. The fruit bodies grow to 30 - 35 mm tall and 8 - 10 mm wide. They are roughly conical, with fleshy longitudinal ribs that lack the <b>cross-ribs</b> characteristic of most other Morchella species. Young specimens have a light lilac tint that darkens or turns grayish in maturity.|$|R

50|$|St. George's Church {{dates to}} the early 14th century and is a three-aisled {{basilica}} with a four-bayed nave, that is covered by a <b>cross-ribbed</b> vaulted ceiling.

The altar, pulpit and double rood loft (Doppelempore) were fashioned in the neogothic style. The altar portrays a crucifixion group with Mary, Mary Magdalene and John. It was carved by a Tyrolean carver. The parish of St. George has about 2,300 members.|$|R
5|$|This ceiling conceals the mediaeval trusses of {{the fifteenth}} century ceiling.

The original ceiling can still be reached from the ringing chamber in the central tower, and includes an arch-braced collar-beam truss, with traces of five <b>cross-ribs</b> equally spaced on the soffit of the four-centred moulded arch.

In contrast, G.caroliniana is almost never lobed and thus lacks seams. Its tightly wrinkled and attached cap mostly hide the undersurface.
