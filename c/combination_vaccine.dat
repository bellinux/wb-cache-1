5|$|An enhanced-potency IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) was {{licensed}} in the United States in November 1987, and {{is currently}} the vaccine of choice in the United States. The first dose of polio vaccine is given shortly after birth, usually between 1 and 2 months of age, a second dose is given at 4 months of age. The timing of the third dose depends on the vaccine formulation but should be given between 6 and 18 months of age. A booster vaccination is given at 4 to 6 years of age, {{for a total of}} four doses at or before school entry. In some countries, a fifth vaccination is given during adolescence. Routine vaccination of adults (18 years of age and older) in developed countries is neither necessary nor recommended because most adults are already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in their home countries. In 2002, a pentavalent (five-component) <b>combination</b> <b>vaccine</b> (called Pediarix) containing IPV was approved for use in the United States.|$|E

In February 2000, the National Vaccine Program Office convened the In-ternational Symposium on <b>Combination</b> <b>Vaccines</b> to explore solutions for barriers to development, licensure, and use of safe and effective <b>combination</b> <b>vaccines.</b> The symposium focused on the following questions: (1) What immunologic standards {{should be used to}} evaluate new <b>combination</b> <b>vaccines?</b> (2) How should correlates of protection be developed, and how should the data they provide be interpreted?
