5|$|Compared {{with other}} major {{periodicals}} of its day, the Analytical Review had a low circulation. While both the Tory <b>Critical</b> <b>Review</b> and the British Critic had {{a circulation of}} 3,500 by 1797 and the Monthly Review realized 5,000, Johnson and Christie's journal only ever achieved about 1,500. However, it was common practice during the eighteenth century for an individual copy of each publication to be read by many different people. Scholars have estimated that each copy of a London newspaper, for example, was read by thirty people; coffeehouses and taverns were well-stocked with copies of newspapers and journals, as were circulating libraries. Hence, circulation numbers offer only a small glimpse into how many people actually read such publications.|$|E

5|$|Game Revolution {{had a more}} <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of Dino Crisis than others, {{saying the}} game {{expanded}} on the worse elements of Resident Evil while also ruining the good elements. They were impressed by the graphics but thought the environments looked too similar and got boring after a short time. Overall, they believed the game to be worse than Resident Evil 2, pointing out the game's shorter length, more tedious puzzles, weaker action, and lesser scare factor.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Grenby, the {{foremost}} expert on Trimmer, {{estimates that the}} Guardians circulation was between 1,500 and 3,500 copies per issue. Thus the Guardians circulation was probably comparable to political periodicals such as the Tory <b>Critical</b> <b>Review</b> and the British Critic, which both reached 3,500 by 1797, or the Analytical Review, which reached about 1,500, {{but not to the}} Monthly Review, which reached approximately 5,000. From June 1802 until January 1804, the Guardian appeared monthly; from then until it ceased publication in September 1806, it was issued quarterly. There were 28 issues in all.|$|E
5|$|The Whig Monthly Review, {{founded in}} 1749 by Ralph Griffiths, and the Tory <b>Critical</b> <b>Review,</b> founded in 1756 by Tobias Smollett, {{were the first}} {{journals}} dedicated to reviewing books in Britain. Although {{they were joined by}} smaller publications such as the Analytical Review, these two journals dominated reviewing {{in the second half of}} the eighteenth century. They focused on poetry, novels, drama, belles-lettres, travel literature, biographies, science writing and other forms of popular literature. They did not review many complex theological or scholarly works, particularly those in foreign languages.|$|E

5|$|The one reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1000 feet long, {{was released}} on July 29, 1910. The film likely had a wide release, but another film {{of the same name}} was released by Società Anonima Ambrosio. The Ambrosio film {{was released on}} November 16, 1910, but several theater advertisements are ambiguous as to the film being shown. It is known that Ambroiso and Thanhouser films were sometimes shown together, as one Maryland theater advertisement shows, further complicating identification. The film received mainly positive reviews from critics. The Morning Telegraph found the story to have a novel way of advertising a hotel, but noted the error in the photographer's attempt and result to photograph the mermaid. The Moving Picture World found the film to be an effective production, but spared few details and a short summary of the film. The most <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> came from The New York Dramatic Mirror which was neutral in its assessment of the production, but it provided a list of faults with the production that focused on continuity issues with action.|$|E

5|$|This film {{marks the}} second {{adaptation}} of Shūsaku Endō's novel, which was previously adapted by Masahiro Shinoda into the 1971 {{film of the}} same name. Scorsese penned the initial screenplay in 1991 with co-writer and longtime collaborator Jay Cocks. However, they were unsatisfied with the script and conducted rewrites for an additional 15 years. Later, Endō's official translator, Van C. Gessel, who has translated eight of his novels, assisted as a consultant on the film. The screenplay as finally filmed was assessed in <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> as an accurate depiction of the novel as written by Endo. Religious historian Haruko Nawata Ward has indicated that {{the inclusion of the}} small crucifix in the deceased priest's hand {{at the end of the}} film was an auteur decision made by Scorsese not included in Endo's original book.|$|E
5|$|Reviews for Advent Children {{have been}} mixed to positive: while critics have praised the presentation, {{graphics}} and fan appeal, all reviews agree that the story's context and delivery were confusing for people new to the series. While western critics were positive about Last Order, the OAV received heavy fan criticism in Japan due to its retconning of key events, which prompted the team {{to ensure that the}} event was faithfully recreated in Crisis Core. Before Crisis, due to remaining in Japan, has received limited attention in the west, but previews have been highly positive, with many praising the gameplay and graphics as being impressive for a mobile game. Opinions for Dirge of Cerberus were decidedly mixed. While many praised the story and characters, especially the focus on Vincent's character and development, critics were mixed to negative about the graphics and gameplay. Japanese magazine Famitsu notably gave the game a delayed and highly <b>critical</b> <b>review.</b> Crisis Core was generally praised, with many enjoying the story's intimate presentation of the characters and action-oriented gameplay, despite some criticism for it being aimed at fans of VII. Critics of the Compilation have generally cited Crisis Core as the best title of the series.|$|E
5|$|A {{more recent}} <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of {{contemporary}} sources doesn't require a supposed typo in 1771 {{to explain this}} shorter measurement for the mizzen whilst {{at the same time}} offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height. Sydney Parkinson's sketches and paintings of Cooks Bark Endeavour along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark Endeavour spar measurements National Maritime Museum in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594, and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter mizzen mast was not stepped in the hold/keelson, but instead was stepped in the lower deck 10ft above this as was sometimes done. This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8– 9ft below the main mast cap and approx 5.5ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops (excludes top and gallant masts) from the level of the water line. Whereas the shorter mizzen stepped in the hold on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing mizzen cap 18ft below the main mast cap which is clearly not the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS Endeavour off the coast of New Holland, by Samuel Atkins c. 1794 {{at the top of this}} page. Zooming this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught NMM ZAZ7844. Using these mizzen chainplate angles from this as fitted draught it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the larboard quarter of Endeavour support this theory of the shorter standing mizzen stepped in the lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped in the hold.|$|E
