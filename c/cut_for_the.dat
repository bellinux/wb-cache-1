5|$|After being <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{second time}} by the Blue Bombers, Alford {{moved back to the}} United States and worked in a glove factory in Memphis. He {{expected}} that his professional football career was over, but he was signed by the Montreal Alouettes in 1999. During training camp, he competed against 11 other receivers for a place on the active roster, with head coach Charlie Taaffe expecting to cut at least five receivers. Alford failed to make the active roster and was released {{before the start of the}} regular season.|$|E

5|$|Tuition is {{paid for}} by general {{taxation}} in Germany, although only 27% of young people gain higher education qualification there, whereas in the UK the comparable figure is 48%. Fully or partly funding universities from general taxation has been criticised by the Liberal Democrat party as a 'tax <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rich and a tax rise for the poor' because people would be taxed to pay for something that many would not derive a benefit from, while graduates generally earn more due to their qualifications and only have to pay them back.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We analyze split {{cuts from}} the {{perspective}} of cut generating functions via geometric lifting. We show that α-cuts, a natural higher-dimensional generalization of the k-cuts of Cornuéjols et al., gives all <b>the</b> split <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mixed-integer corner relaxation. As an immediate consequence we obtain that the k-cuts are equivalent to split <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1 -row mixed-integer relaxation. Further, we show that split <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> finite-dimensional corner relaxations are restrictions of split <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> infinite-dimensional relaxation. In a final application of this equivalence, we exhibit a family of pure-integer programs whose split closure have arbitrarily bad integrality gap.

5|$|During the eight-month period, Beyoncé {{recorded}} over seventy {{songs and}} decided during the editing process {{that she did}} not want to reconcile the two approaches into one disc. If a song was meaningless to her, she cut them off during the process of elimination for the final track listing. After a process of elimination, twelve tracks were selected to be placed on the standard edition of the album, while five additional tracks were chosen to make the final <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> deluxe edition of the album. Beyoncé later revealed that songs from established producers like The Neptunes and Danja were not able to make the final cut.|$|E
5|$|Mariah Carey is {{the debut}} studio album by American singer Mariah Carey, {{released}} on June 12, 1990 by Columbia Records. Its music incorporates {{a range of}} contemporary genres {{with a mix of}} slow ballads and up-tempo tracks. Originally, Carey wrote four songs with Ben Margulies, which solely constituted her demo tape. While altered and partially re-sung after being signed to Columbia, all four songs made the final <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> album. Aside from Margulies, Carey worked with a range of professional writers and producers, all of whom were hired by Columbia CEO, Tommy Mottola. Mariah Carey featured production and writing from Rhett Lawrence, Ric Wake and Narada Michael Walden, all of whom were top record producers at the time. Together with Carey, they conceived the album and reconstructed her original demo tape.|$|E
5|$|New World Pictures {{produced}} a 95-minute English-dubbed {{adaptation of the}} film, titled Warriors of the Wind, and it was released theatrically in the United States in June 1985, with the VHS video release in December 1985. In the late 1980s, Vestron Video would release the film and First Independent Video would re-release it in 1993 with another minute cut from the film. The voice actors and actresses were not informed of the film's plotline and the film was heavily edited to market it as a children's action-adventure film. Consequently, part of the film's narrative meaning was lost: some of the environmentalist themes were diluted as was the main subplot of the Ohmu, altered {{to turn them into}} aggressive enemies. Most of the characters' names were changed, including the titular character who became Princess Zandra. The United States cover for the VHS release featured a cadre of male characters who are not in the film, riding the resurrected God Warrior—including a still-living Warrior shown briefly in a flashback. Approximately 22 minutes of scenes were <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> film's North American release.|$|E

5|$|The {{business}} software publisher Scandinavian PC Systems {{found out about}} the game through Upp; they were expanding at the time and wanted to add a video game to their catalogue, so they contacted the game's developers. The Eriksson brothers and Johansson developed a version for home computers, but had problems with compiling it for the PC, as it was a much larger BASIC program than most compilers could handle. Due to copyright issues, a scene in the mainframe version of the game where the player guest stars in The Muppet Show had to be <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> commercial release, but all other materials remained intact; additionally, some visuals and audio were created and added for this release. The game was published by Scandinavian PC Systems for IBM PCs in Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and English in 1986. The developers negotiated with Scandinavian PC Systems, and were given 5 SEK per sold copy of the Swedish version and 2 SEK per sold foreign copy as royalties; 30,000 SEK of the royalties were pre-paid.|$|E
5|$|Müller {{was named}} in Germany's {{provisional}} 27-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup along with seven other Bayern Munich players. Despite suffering a scare {{when he fell}} off his bicycle at the team's training camp in South Tyrol, Müller only received superficial injuries and made the final <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tournament when the squad was reduced to 23 players. He was allocated the number 13, normally worn by injured captain Michael Ballack, and previously worn by Müller's eponym Gerd. He earned his second international cap in the final warm-up match before the World Cup when he came on as a half-time substitute for Piotr Trochowski in a 3–1 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina. He started {{the first game of}} Germany's World Cup campaign and scored the third goal – his first internationally – in a 4–0 win over Australia, winning Germany's goal of the month award in the process. He played in all Germany's group games, as they finished top of Group D; he scored twice and assisted once in the 4–1 victory over England in the round of 16. In the third minute of Germany's 4–0 quarter final win against Argentina, he opened the scoring with his fourth tournament goal. However, he picked up his second booking of the tournament in the first half, for a handball and was suspended for the semi-final defeat against Spain. Müller said that he felt far more nervous during the Spain game than any he was able to play. He returned to the team for the third-place playoff against Uruguay and scored the first goal, his fifth of the tournament, as Germany won 3–2 to take the bronze medals. The team's success was a culmination of a series of changes made after the national team's failure at Euro 2000. The Germans emphasized a more open, attack-minded style not previously associated with Germany, and included prominent young players, including Müller, Sami Khedira and Mesut Özil.|$|E

40|$|We propose general {{separation}} procedures <b>for</b> generating <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> stable set polytope, {{inspired by}} a procedure by Rossi and Smriglio and applying a lifting method by Xavier and Campêlo.

This is accomplished by iteratively solving a lifting problem, which consists of a maximum weighted stable set problem on a smaller graph. Computational experience on DIMACS benchmark instances shows that the proposed approach may be a useful tool <b>for</b> generating <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> stable set polytope...|$|R

The computational results suggest that reachability cuts can be highly useful as cutting planes for certain VRPTW instances. Routing; time windows; precedence constraints...|$|R
