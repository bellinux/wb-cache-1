40|$|Abstract — The goal of optimal {{reconfiguration}} planning (ORP) {{is to find}} a shortest reconfiguration sequence {{to transform}} a modular and reconfigurable robot from an arbitrary configuration into another. This paper investigates this challenging problem for <b>chain-typed</b> robots based on graph representations and presents a series of theoretical results: (1) A formal proof that this is a NP-complete problem, (2) A reconfiguration planning algorithm called MDCOP which generates the optimal graph-based reconfiguration plan, (3) Another algorithm called GreedyCM which can find near-optimal solution in polynomial time. Experimental and statistical results demonstrate that the solutions found by GreedyCM are indeed near optimal and the approach is computationally feasible for large-scale robots...|$|R
40|$|Multi-way Theta-join {{queries are}} {{powerful}} in describing complex relations and therefore widely employed in real practices. However, existing solutions from traditional distributed and parallel databases for multi-way Theta-join queries cannot be easily extended {{to fit a}} shared-nothing distributed computing paradigm, which is proven {{to be able to}} support OLAP applications over immense data volumes. In this work, we study the problem of efficient processing of multi-way Theta-join queries using MapReduce from a costeffective perspective. Although there have been some works using the (key,value) pair-based programming model to support join operations, efficient processing of multi-way Thetajoin queries has never been fully explored. The substantial challenge lies in, given a number of processing units (that can run Map or Reduce tasks), mapping a multi-way Thetajoin query to a number of MapReduce jobs and having them executed in a well scheduled sequence, such that the total processing time span is minimized. Our solution mainly includes two parts: 1) cost metrics for both single MapReduce job and a number of MapReduce jobs executed in a certain order; 2) the efficient execution of a <b>chain-typed</b> Theta-join with only one MapReduce job. Comparing with the query evaluation strategy proposed in [23] and the widely adopted Pig Latin and Hive SQL solutions, our method achieves significant improvement of the join processing efficiency. © 2012 VLDB Endowment...|$|R
5000|$|Since February 2000, the Federal Reserve Board’s semiannual {{monetary}} policy reports to Congress {{have described the}} Board’s outlook for inflation {{in terms of the}} PCE. Prior to that, the inflation outlook was presented in terms of the CPI. In explaining its preference for the PCE, the Board stated:The <b>chain-type</b> price PCE index draws extensively on data from the consumer price index but, while not entirely free of measurement problems, has several advantages relative to the CPI. The PCE <b>chain-type</b> index is constructed from a formula that reflects the changing composition of spending and thereby avoids some of the upward bias associated with the fixed-weight nature of the CPI. In addition, the weights are based on a more comprehensive measure of expenditures. Finally, historical data used in the PCE price index can be revised to account for newly available information and for improvements in measurement techniques, including those that affect source data from the CPI; the result is a more consistent series over time.—Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,Federal Reserve Board of Governors,Feb. 17, 2000 ...|$|E

50|$|A wheel {{trencher}} or rockwheel {{is composed}} of a toothed metal wheel. It is cheaper to operate and maintain than <b>chain-type</b> trenchers. It can work in hard or soft soils, either homogeneous (compact rocks, silts, sands) or heterogeneous (split or broken rock, alluvia, moraines). This is particularly true because a cutting wheel works by clearing the soil as a bucket-wheel does, rather than like a rasp (chain trencher). Consequently, it will be less sensitive {{to the presence of}} blocks in the soil. They are also used to cut pavement for road maintenance and to gain access to utilities under roads.|$|E

This mounting position makes it very difficult to access from underneath the car (without a mechanic's ramp), and despite being very short, the can-type oil filter still manages to protrude past the tip of the adjacent starter motor, meaning it is very difficult to remove using <b>chain-type</b> grips.|$|E

50|$|More recently, nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance studies in Xenopus oocyte BK channels have shed further light on the structural properties of the ball and chain domain. The introduction of the KCNMB2 β subunit to the cytoplasmic side of a non-inactivating channel restored inactivation, conforming to the expected behaviour of a ball and <b>chain-type</b> protein. NMR analysis showed that the ball domain is composed of residues 1-17 and the chain region of residues 20-45. The three amino acids in the middle constitute a flexible linker region between the two functional regions. The ball is at the N-terminus of the β subunit and consists of a disordered part (residues 1-10) and a loop-helix motif formed by a block of amino acids spanning from serine at position 11 to aspartate at position 16. The structure of the chain domain is 4-turn alpha helix structure.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Currently, <b>chain-type</b> {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} (WSN) is widely used in many fields such as bridge structure and gas pipeline monitoring. To reduce the channel conflict and energy consumption of the network, a novel Media Access Control (MAC) protocol for <b>chain-type</b> WSN based on token is proposed. It takes the token in the beacon frame to control adjacent sensor nodes for communication. Message equipped mechanism is used to embed synchronization information into the routing protocol, which can realize coarse-grained time synchroni- zation. To improve reliability, this paper proposes a novel transmission mechanism by sending redundant data packets through a single path. Experimental {{results show that the}} new protocol can improve stability and reliability in transmission, prolong life cycle and meet the application requirements of <b>chain-type</b> WSN.

40|$|Atomic {{engineering}} {{of complex}} oxide thin films is now reaching a new paradigm: {{the possibility to}} control the cation coordination by oxygen anions. Here, we show two examples of stabilization of novel structural phases by manipulating the oxygen sublattices in complex Cu-based oxide thin films grown on SrTiO 3 : (i) epitaxial strain stabilization of a near cubic form of CuO and (ii) thickness-dependent structural transformation from bulk planar (polar) to <b>chain-type</b> (nonpolar) in SrCuO 2 thin films that relieves the electrostatic instability. Experimental investigation on ultrathin CuO layer identifies {{the existence of an}} elongated (c/a ∼ 1. 34) rocksalt-type CuO phase, pointing to metastable 6 -fold coordinated Cu with the hole occupied in the 3 d x 2 −y 2 orbital. For ultrathin SrCuO 2 layers, we demonstrate the possibility of moving oxygen ion from CuO 2 -plane to Sr-plane forming <b>chain-type</b> structure. X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals preferential hole-occupation at the Cu- 3 d 3 z 2 −r 2 orbital for <b>chain-type</b> structure unlike to the planar case.

40|$|Abstract. A {{number of}} modular robotic {{systems have been}} {{developed}} over the last decade. Such systems promise increased flexibility and robustness and lower cost over conventional robots; however programming systems with many degrees of freedom is still more an art than engineering. The complexity of programming limits the usage of such systems and the sharing of knowledge within the modular robotics community. We have previously published work on using “Phase Automata ” as a programming model for <b>chain-type</b> modular robotic systems. In this paper, we present an XML-based scripting language for describing phase automata and complex behavior compositions.
