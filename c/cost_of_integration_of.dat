The bus network extender {{is a relatively}} inexpensive system that minimizes the time and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> avionic systems by providing a convenient mechanism for early testing without the need to transport the usual test equipment and personnel to an integration facility.

40|$|This paper revisits {{the puzzle}} of {{immigration}} policy: standard economic theory predicts that free immigration improves natives' welfare, but (with few historical exceptions) an open door policy is never implemented in practice. What rationalizes the puzzle? We first review the model of immigration policy where the policy maker maximizes national income of natives net of the tax burden of immigration (Borjas, 1995). We show that this model fails to provide realistic policy outcomes when the receiving region's technology is described by a standard Cobb-Douglas or CES function, as the optimal policy imposes a complete ban on immigration or implies an unrealistically large number of immigrants relative to natives. Then the paper describes three extensions of this basic model that reconcile the theory with the evidence. The first introduces a <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> the immigrant community in the destination country; the second {{takes into account the}} policy maker's redistributive concern across different social groups; the last extension considers positive spillover effects of (skilled) migrants on the receiving economy. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{explains}} why {{open source software}} is an instance of a potentially broader phenomenon. Specifically, I suggest that nonproprietary peer-production of information and cultural materials will likely be a ubiquitous phenomenon in a pervasively networked society. I describe a number of such enterprises, at various stages of the information production value chain. These enterprises suggest that incentives to engage in nonproprietary peer production are trivial as long as enough contributors can be organized to contribute. This implies that the limit on the reach of peer production efforts is the modularity, granularity, and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> a good produced, not its total cost. I also suggest reasons to think that peer-production can have systematic advantages over both property-based markets and corporate managerial hierarchies {{as a method of}} organizing information and cultural production in a networked environment, because it is a better mechanism for clearing information about human capital available to work on existing information inputs to produce new outputs, and because it permits largers sets of agents to use larger sets of resources where there are increasing returns to the scale of both the set of agents and the set of resources available for work on projects. As capital costs and communications costs decrease in importance as factors of information production, the relative advantage of peer production in clearing human capital becomes more salient.

40|$|Thermal {{energy storage}} {{can be an}} {{attractive}} technology to enable re-use of waste-heat, especially for batch processes. A case study was carried out to evaluate the technical and economical feasibility of an industrial heat storage system. The study focused on integration of a heat storage system within an existing production facility of organic surfactants. Three different thermal storage systems with operating temperatures between 110 °C to 160 °C were designed to store the heat released during the exothermic reaction phase and re-use the heat for preheating of the reactants in the following batch. The first system uses a Phase Change Material (PCM) contained in metal balls with an assumed phase change temperature at 140 °C. The second system uses a concrete volume as a sensible heat storage material and the third system is also based on concrete, but with a doubling of the storage capacity. A dynamic simulation was performed of a reference cycle of a batch reactor coupled with a thermal storage system to calculate energy savings for preheating of the reactants. It was required to oversize the storage capacity of the PCM system, {{in order to obtain}} a heat transfer rate that matches with the conditions of the actual process. The calculated energy savings for heating of the batch reactors is 50 to 70 %, resulting in financial savings of 26 to 38 k€ on an annual basis. The total capital investment of the storage systems is estimated at 440 to 540 k€. Simple pay out time is higher than 10 years, with the best result for the concrete heat storage. The bare cost of the thermal buffer is 15 % to 30 % of the total capital investment. Because the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> the storage system in an existing facility are {{a large part of the}} total cost, it is recommended to evaluate the use of thermal storage systems for grass-roots situations...|$|E

40|$|The growing {{sophistication of}} {{component}} technologies {{and the rising}} <b>costs</b> and uncertainties <b>of</b> developing and launching new products require firms to collaborate {{in the development of}} new products. However, the management of new product development that occurs jointly between firms presents a new set of challenges in sharing the <b>costs</b> and benefits <b>of</b> innovation. Although collaboration enables each firm to focus on what it does best, it also introduces new issues associated with the alignment of decisions and incentives that have to be managed alongside conventional performance and timing uncertainties of new product development. In this paper, we conceptualize and formulate the joint development of products involving two firms with differing development capabilities and examine the implications of arrangements that go beyond sharing of revenues to include sharing <b>of</b> development <b>cost</b> and work. We term these approaches that involve sharing <b>of</b> the development <b>cost</b> and sharing <b>of</b> the development work investment sharing and innovation sharing, respectively. These cost and effort sharing mechanisms have subtle interactions with the degree to which revenues are shared between firms and the type of development project under consideration. Our analysis shows that investment and innovation sharing are particularly relevant for products with no preexisting revenues, and their benefits also depend on the degree to which revenues are shared between the firms. Whereas investment sharing is more attractive for new-to-the-world product projects with significant timing uncertainty, innovation sharing {{plays an important role in}} environments where projects experience product quality uncertainty, firms are similar in their capabilities, and the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> work across firms can be controlled.

The memory-related CDA and P 3 components instead depended on the perceived number of targets irrespective their actual succession. The report of two separate targets was associated with elevated amplitude, while integrated as well as actual single targets exhibited lower amplitude.

Moreover transmission bottlenecks may occur between various regions. Modelling explicitly the stochastic behaviour of wind generation and taking into account the prediction error is crucial for an evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> wind power.

Key issues included highly variable construction quality; physical, planning and legal constraints; an imperfect building controls regime; <b>cost</b> and benefits <b>of</b> retrofitting; owner attitudes; {{and the challenge of}} finding viable funding mechanisms. The study included a review of regional seismology, geotechnical investigations, as-built condition surveys, structural analyses, earthquake performance assessment, retrofitting solutions, social impacts, and analysis of the benefits and <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> retrofitting. The <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> social and community considerations into the choice of retrofitting techniques was an important and unique aspect of the study.

By formulating technical solutions that take account of social and economic conditions, and providing detailed analyses <b>of</b> benefits and <b>costs,</b> the study provides an invaluable resource to help owners and authorities to decide on approaches for retrofitting in Turkey and elsewhere. ...|$|R
40|$|Joining {{a series}} of {{analyses}} of effects of othering, orientalism, or coloniality in East Central Europe, the paper asks how long-term structural-ideological effects of global hierarchies, as reflected in post-colonial contexts by the term “coloniality of power,” can be conceptualized for East Central Europe. In {{a case study of}} political polarization in post-socialist Hungary,it examines the effects <b>of</b> global <b>integration,</b>  claiming that two dominant economic-political blocks formed along a division of vertical alliances related to integration with either Western or national capital. From those positions, they developed divergent political ideologies of development: modernization through Western <b>integration,</b> versus the protection <b>of</b> “national” wealth from Western capital and its local allies. While both propagated capitalist integration, they each needed to develop ideologies that appealed to electorates suffering the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration.</b> One framing <b>of</b> developmentalist emancipation promised Western modernity through rejection of popular, backward characteristics of the country, including nationalism.

40|$|A {{goal of the}} {{aerospace}} industry {{is to reduce the}} <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> space transportation by a significant within the next decade. The present <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> launching a space transportation system which includes propulsion system, vehicle, carrier, and payload integrated together to form a system, encompasses much more than the design of the propulsion system and vehicle. The total cost includes the recurring <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the process of integrating carriers, and payloads into the vehicle for each flight. The recurring <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> carrier/payloads systems is driven by the interaction of the vehicle. If the interaction can be well characterized and made to be very predictable for a range of payloads, or if it can be minimized then the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> integrating a payload can be reduced significantly from today's levels. The Space Shuttle is very interactive with the payload. The interaction has been well characterized through finite element modeling and is reasonably predictable for a specific payload. Experience has shown, however, that the interaction is very manifest dependent, and small changes in one portion of a payload complement can change the interaction significantly in another portion. That is the affects of one on the other are such that if one or the other is changed slightly the environment at the interfaces can change significantly. To date the Shuttle has made in excess of one hundred flights. For each of these flights several iterations of dynamic analyses have been required in the development of each vehicle/carrier/payload system. The iterative analyses are needed because of the sensitivity of the interaction of the launch vehicle to the attached carrier/payload. The Multi Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) is a carrier designed for flight in the Space Shuttle carrying a wide variation of cargo, supplies, and experiments to and from Space Station.

By contrast, the ‘wide open spaces’ and low population densities of regional areas are a considerable advantage for siting new RE installations. The large-scale deployment of RE plants in the regional Australia is a need and requirement for both environmental sustainability and energy efficiency.

40|$|When {{asked to}} rank {{industries}} by their degree <b>of</b> vertical <b>integration,</b> {{most people would}} agree that the oil industry should come top of the list. Underlying this belief {{is the fact that}} integration and size tend to be closely associated. As the oil industry is so large and oil companies so visible and perceived as so profitable, the common belief is a correlation between vertical integration, size and performance. If a dynamic view is taken of this cross-sectional observation we would expect to find an oil industry populated only by fully integrated very large companies. However, {{a closer look at the}} industry shows a large dispersion in the segments in which companies participate, and even companies in the same segments use the market in different degrees. Furthermore, the average degree <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> the industry does not exhibit a specific trend over time. The only periods when trends are seen are periods of either large uncertainty (the intra-war periods) or large market power (the period of existence of the Standard Oil Trust). Although the public and the government agencies may have a view of the large advantages <b>of</b> <b>integration,</b> the surprising fact is that many empirical studies do not focus on its <b>costs.</b> The observation <b>of</b> dispersion and stability <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> would suggest, as theoretical studies do, that a cost-benefit analysis <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> is needed. This study uses that driving hypothesis and tests for the <b>costs</b> and benefits <b>of</b> <b>integration.</b> The measure <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> should reflect the effects of slack, diseconomies of size and diseconomies of diversification. The obvious choice is a measure of efficiency, namely technical efficiency, that looks at waste assuming inputs are used in the right proportion. The advantages <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> are traditionally set in terms of reliable supply of inputs or reliable demand for outputs. As the existence of uncertainty is a feature of oil markets, a test of uncertainty is made in the form of variability of efficiency. The use of efficiency in both tests is made for the purpose of consistency and is incorporated in the same econometric framework. The cost-benefit analysis would suggest that each company pursues integration Lip to the point where its benefits are outweighed by its costs. The results in this paper confirm just that: vertical <b>integration</b> reduces the level <b>of</b> efficiency of companies while it also reduces its variability. In other words, there are diseconomies of diversification but the market also incorporates inefficient volatility. However, the results are not impervious to change, there are periods when the inefficiency associated with integration is smaller as is also the risk-reducing ability of the strategy. This may help to explain the reasons why different degrees <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> may be optimal. </p...|$|R

The general direction of a modern electronics is integration or size reduction. With recent reductions in the size of physical circuits, we may also require an abbreviation of electronics acronyms. Therefore, the mainstream of aviation systems with microwave integrated circuits can be named by the acronym avmic, formed from letters of words AViation Microwave Integrated Circuits. The author used the more common acronym avionics in the title of the article to be better understood by the readers. The changing of terminology (if necessary) is a decision for the experts in the future. Avionics has come to include communications, navigation, flight control, collision avoidance, military applications, landing aids, guidance and lighting, as well as electronics systems involved with the display and management of multiple systems [1 - 6]. Avionics refers to electronic systems on aircraft, artificial satellites and spacecraft that provide communications, navigation and guidance, display systems, flight management systems, sensors and indicators, weather radars, electrical systems, and various computers onboard modern aircraft and spacecraft.

In order to reach a political agreement, the key for distributing refugees should be complemented by compensation payments that distribute the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> among countries. The key for distributing refugees presented by the EU Commission takes account of appropriate factors in principle, but it is unclear in terms of detail. The compensation payments for countries that should take relatively high numbers <b>of</b> refugees for <b>cost</b> efficiency reasons should be financed by reallocating resources within the EU budget...|$|R

And when a justi¯ca-tion is required, decision makers are often judged by results: if the resulting performance is above a pre-de¯ned threshold this is ¯ne; otherwise this is considered a failure. This paper explores the <b>cost</b> and bene¯t <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> under such a Simonian working of reviewing processes. We identify the fol-lowing <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> non-integration: bargaining ine±ciencies arise because the threshold performances that determine the criterion of success need not be adapted to every single negotiation. And the main <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> is its exposure to opportunism because the opportunism in one division has spillover e®ects in the other divisions of integrated organizations...|$|R

This paper presents an approach to integrating disparate heterogeneous information sources that uses context logic. Our use of context logic reduces the up-front <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration,</b> provides an incremental integration path, and allows semantic conflicts within a single information sources or between information sources to be expressed and resolved...|$|R

Moreover, while the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> and the liability <b>of</b> newness are at their greatest during a subsidiary’s first years, prior studies have tested their competing arguments on samples containing older subsidiaries. We extend these prior studies by (1) developing an institutional theory-based framework that simultaneously considers the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> and the liability <b>of</b> newness, (2) recognizing that both types <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> vary with the level <b>of</b> subsidiary <b>integration,</b> and (3) focusing {{on the stage of}} their life during which subsidiaries predominantly incur these costs. To measure subsidiary performance, we ask managers of Dutch multinationals how their ex ante performance expectations compare to the subsidiary’s ex post performance during its first two years. Analyzing a sample of 191 foreign subsidiaries and controlling for entry mode self-selection and other factors, we find that acquisitions outperform greenfields at low and intermediate levels <b>of</b> subsidiary <b>integration,</b> but that greenfields outperform acquisitions at higher integration levels...|$|R
