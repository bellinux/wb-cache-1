40|$|CHARGE {{syndrome}} {{was initially}} {{defined as a}} non-random association of anomalies (Coloboma, Heart defect, Atresia choanae, Retarded growth and development, Genital hypoplasia, Ear anomalies/deafness). In 1998, an expert group defined the major (the classical 4 C's: Choanal atresia, Coloboma, Characteristic ears and Cranial nerve anomalies) and minor criteria of CHARGE syndrome. Individuals with all four major characteristics or three major and three minor characteristics are highly likely to have CHARGE syndrome. However, there have been individuals genetically identified with CHARGE syndrome without the classical choanal atresia and coloboma. The reported incidence of CHARGE syndrome ranges from 0. 1 – 1. 2 / 10, 000 and depends on professional recognition. Coloboma mainly affects the retina. Major and minor congenital heart defects (the commonest cyanotic heart defect is tetralogy of Fallot) occur in 75 – 80 % of patients. Choanal atresia may be membranous or bony; bilateral or unilateral. Mental retardation is variable with intelligence quotients (IQ) ranging from normal to profound retardation. Under-development of the external genitalia is a common finding in males but it is less apparent in females. Ear abnormalities include a classical finding of unusually shaped ears and hearing loss (<b>conductive</b> and/or nerve <b>deafness</b> that ranges from mild to severe deafness). Multiple cranial nerve dysfunctions are common. A behavioral phenotype for CHARGE syndrome is emerging. Mutations in the CHD 7 gene (member of the chromodomain helicase DNA protein family) are detected in over 75 % of patients with CHARGE syndrome. Children with CHARGE syndrome require intensive medical management as well as numerous surgical interventions. They also need multidisciplinary follow up.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{explore the}} value of {{computed}} tomography virtual endoscopy (VE) in assessing ossicular chain disruption in temporal bone fracture and ear trauma with intact tympanum. MethodsHigh resolution spiral computerized tomography (CT) was completed in 35 cases of temporal bone fracture and 5 cases of tympanum trauma, all with intact or healed tympanum. Three-dimensional reconstruction was completed using a virtual endoscopy software. Audiological tests were conducted in all patients and evaluation of facial nerve injury in patients with facial paralysis. Patients with mild <b>conductive</b> <b>deafness,</b> ossicular chain subluxation on VE, and no facial paralysis were treated conservatively for 4 - 12 weeks with repeated hearing evaluation; those with facial paralysis underwent surgery if no recovery after 4 - 8 weeks of conservative treatment. Patients with moderate to severe conductive hearing loss or mixed hearing loss, incus long process fracture or dislocation on VE and facial paralysis, underwent ossicular chain reconstruction and facial nerve decompression after conservative treatment for 4 - 8 weeks, or exploratory tympanotomy only if no facial paralysis. VE, audiological tests and facial nerve function tests were repeated in 3 - 6 months after surgery. ResultsOf the 6 cases with mild conductive hearing loss, ossicular chain subluxation and no facial paralysis, 3 recovered to normal hearing spontaneously and 3 showed no significant improvement, after 4 - 12 weeks of conservative treatment. After conservative treatment for 4 - 8 weeks, 3 of the 12 cases with mild <b>conductive</b> <b>deafness,</b> ossicular chain dislocation on VE and facial paralysis recovered to normal hearing and House-Brackmann (HB) grade I facial function from HB grade II, 4 showed facial function recovery to HB grade I (n= 2) or II (n= 2) from HB grade III but no hearing recovery, and 5 gained no recovery {{and went on to}} receive exploratory tympanotomy and facial nerve decompression. The 11 cases with moderate to severe <b>conductive</b> <b>deafness,</b> incus long process fracture or dislocation on VE and facial paralysis all received ossicular chain reconstruction and facial nerve decompression after 4 - 8 weeks of conservative treatment. The 7 cases with moderate to severe <b>conductive</b> <b>deafness,</b> dislocated or fallen incus on VE but no facial paralysis received ossicular chain reconstruction after conservative treatment. The 4 cases with mixed hearing loss, dislocated or fallen incus on VE and no facial paralysis received ossicular chain repair via the intact canal wall epitympanum approach after conservative treatment. Pharmacological therapies continued postoperatively in these patients to treat sensorineural deafness. Although temporal bone CT scans displayed the fracture line and malleus/incus abnormalities, VE provided additional detailed information on dislocation of incudomalleal and incudostapedial joints, incus dislocation or fracture, separation between crus longum incudis and stapes, and incus shifting. These were all confirmed during surgery. VE results and surgery findings were 100 % consistent in patients with ossicular chain disruption.

Hearing aids help the people with <b>conductive</b> <b>deafness</b> which is outer ear deafness by amplifying the sound. The cochlear implant uses its own electrical signals to stimulate the auditory nerve, by completely bypassing the damaged part of the cochlea, allowing the person to hear. Cochlear implant is different from hearing aid because hearing aid system deals with the people who have partial hearing loss and cochlear implant concerns for people whose auditory sensors (hearing cells in the cochlea) are not functional at all. Hardware of the speech processor is described in detail. In the proposed system, sound is picked up by the microphone and is amplified using microphone amplifier circuit and given to filter which will pass sound in the range of 1 kHz- 6 kHz and that signal is simultaneously given to three band pass filters for division into sub-bands and then to three LEDs through threshold detectors...|$|E

40|$|Gap {{junctions}} are assemblies of intercellular {{channels that}} regulate {{a variety of}} physiologic and developmental processes through the exchange of small ions and signaling molecules. These channels consist of connexin family proteins that allow for diversity of channel composition and conductance properties.

40|$|Introduction: Treacher-Collins {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} craniofacial malformations, narrowing of {{the external auditory canal}} (EAC), and, in 30 % of cases, agenesis of the canal and ossicular chain defects. The use of hearing aids (HA) is not possible in cases in which agenesis or stenosis of the EAC accompanies <b>conductive</b> <b>deafness.</b> In contrast, bone conduction implants such as the Bone Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA®) allow direct stimulation of the cochlea and are thus superior to conventional hearing aids in cases of severe conductive hearing loss. Objective: To present 2 cases of patients with Treacher-Collins syndrome who underwent implantation of BAHA®. Cases Reports: The first patient was a 52 -year-old woman diagnosed with Treacher-Collins syndrome who presented with severe bilateral mixed hearing loss and a history of unsuccessful previous use of a bone contact conduction device. The BAHA® implantation was uneventful, and the post-operative results were good.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the case of}} a patient who presented with a right-sided glomus jugulare tumor and bilateral glomus vagale tumors. These proved to be nonmalignant paragangliomas on histopathological analysis. Genetic analysis revealed a germline heterozygous missense mutation (Pro 81 Leu) in the succinate dehydrogenase subunit D (SDHD) gene. We discuss the clinical presentations of the familial paraganglioma syndrome type 1, which is caused by mutations in SDHD, and the implications for the clinical diagnosis and care of such patients. Case Report A 35 -year old lady presented with rightsided pulsatile tinnitus, <b>conductive</b> <b>deafness,</b> and a vascular lesion in the floor of the right external auditory meatus. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a right-sided glomus jugulare tumor and bilateral glomus vagale tumors (Figure 1). Both her paternal grandfather and her father had undergone neck surgery for tumors. She was an only child and had a two-year-old son. She was normotensive, with no clinical features of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome or neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1). Serum calcium, urine catecholamine excretion, and serum calcitonin were within normal limits. Radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine scanning and MRI imaging of her abdomen did not demonstrate any intraabdominal paragangliomas. She underwent partial excision of her right glomus jugulare tumor, with complete excision of both the glomus vagale tumors. Histology showed nonmalignant paragangliomas. Genomic DNA analysis revealed a germline heterozygous missense mutation (p. Pro 81 Leu) in exon 3 of the succinate dehydrogenase subunit D (SDHD) gene. Therefore she was diagnosed with familial paraganglioma syndrome type...|$|E
40|$|The {{source of}} the sound came from a loud speaker {{connected}} to a beat frequency oscillator. The examinees were all patients with hearing defect or deafness. The localisation of the subjective median for the {{source of the}} sound in the horizontal plane of their ears were examined and the results were as follows; 1. The monaural localization was unable to be made. 2. They were able to locate the source between 515 d. b. or more from the threshold (of Intensity) by their poorer ear. 3. In ears with equal hearing, the source of the sound was localized accurately in the median. But when the hearing of one ear was better, the source of the sound localized to that one. 4. The position of his apparent median plane in the horizontal plane was shown as the angular displacement. The longer the period of difficult hearing was, the smaller the angular displacement was. (general type of angular displacement) 5. When the threshold was 50 - 60 d. b. or more (of sensation level), the angular displacement was very great and did not become smaller as the period difficult hearing grew. 6. In patients with neural deafness the range of subjective median was as small as normal hearing, and in a patient with <b>conductive</b> <b>deafness</b> it was very large. 7. After catheterization in the so-called tubotympanic catarrh the range of subjective median become very small, especially during the early stage. This was due to the improvement of conduction mechanism...|$|E
