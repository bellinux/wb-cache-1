50|$|Lysimachia hybrida, <b>common</b> name Mississippi <b>loosestrife</b> or lowland yellow loosestrife, is a {{plant species}} {{widespread}} {{in much of}} the United States and Canada, absent only from the deserts in the west and the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions of the far north. It prefers moist locales such as marshes, swamps, wet meadows, stream banks, etc.|$|R
50|$|Lysimachia asperulifolia (orth. var. L. asperulaefolia) is a {{rare species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the Primulaceae known by the <b>common</b> name rough-leaved <b>loosestrife</b> and roughleaf yellow loosestrife. It is endemic to the Atlantic coastal plain in North Carolina and northern South Carolina in the United States, where there are 64 known populations. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to its value as a bird habitat, {{it is also an}} important nursery and spawning area for fish, including striped bass, shad, herring, and mummichog. Some 1,000 snapping turtles live in the marsh, and frequently lay their eggs at the nearby Boscobel estate grounds. The area contains invasive species like <b>common</b> reed, purple <b>loosestrife,</b> water caltrop, zebra mussels, and mute swans.|$|R
50|$|Lythrum tribracteatum is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the loosestrife family known by the <b>common</b> name threebract <b>loosestrife.</b> It is native to Europe, and it is found in parts of western North America as an introduced species. It often grows in moist habitat, such as ponds. This is an erect, branching annual herb growing up to about 30 centimeters in maximum height. The oblong leaves are up to 2.5 centimeters long and arranged oppositely on the lower stem, and alternately on the upper. Clusters of small flowers grow in the leaf axils, each with glandular bright red sepals and tiny lavender petals.|$|R
50|$|Lythrum californicum is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the loosestrife family known by the <b>common</b> name California <b>loosestrife.</b> It is native to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States into the Midwest as far east as Oklahoma and Texas. It often grows in moist habitat. This is an erect perennial herb reaching 20 to 60 cm tall, sometimes branching. The waxy linear to lance-shaped leaves are arranged oppositely lower on the plant, and alternately toward the top. They are 1 to 7 cm in length. The inflorescence is a terminal spike of flowers with purple petals under a centimeter long. Flowers are heterostylous on one individual plant, with some having long, protruding styles and some with shorter styles not protruding {{from the mouth of}} the flower. The fruit is an oval capsule containing many minute seeds.|$|R
50|$|Lythrum hyssopifolia (orth. var. L. hyssopifolium) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the loosestrife family known by the <b>common</b> names hyssop <b>loosestrife</b> and grass-poly. It is native to Europe but it is known elsewhere, including parts of Australia and eastern and western North America, as an introduced species and sometimes a weed. It often grows in moist habitat, such as marshes and wet agricultural fields, rice paddies, for example. This is a mostly upright, branching annual or biennial herb growing 10 to 60 centimeters tall. The oval leaves are arranged oppositely lower on the plant, and often alternately toward the top. They are up to 3 centimeters in length. The inflorescence is a terminal spike of flowers with pinkish petals up to half a centimeter long. The fruit is an oval capsule containing many minute seeds.|$|R
40|$|Invasive plants {{continue}} to spread in riparian ecosystems, causing both ecological and economic damage. This research investigated {{the impacts of}} <b>common</b> reed, purple <b>loosestrife,</b> riparian shrubland, and riparian woodlands on {{the quality and quantity}} of sandhill crane roosting habitat in the central Platte River, Nebraska, using a discrete choice model. A more detailed investigation of the impacts of common reed on sandhill crane roosting habitat was performed by forecasting a spread or contraction of this invasive plant. The discrete choice model indicates that riparian woodlands had the largest negative impact on sandhill crane roosting habitat. The forecasting results predict that a contraction of common reed could increase sandhill crane habitat availability by 50 %, whereas an expansion could reduce the availability by as much as 250 %. This suggests that if the distribution of common reed continues to expand in the central Platte River the availability of sandhill crane roosting habitat would likely be greatly reduced...|$|R
40|$|Demonstrate the {{interactive}} GIS database {{that has been}} developed by this group to collect, store and disseminate invasive plant species location and associated attribute information. This environmental core research group has initiated a multi-year strategetic plan to monitor and control the spread of non-native invasive plant species in the Adirondack Park. The spread of invasive non-native plant species {{is one of the}} greatest threats to our natural plant communities throughout the United States. Increasingly, we are seeing aggressive non-native plants taking the place of many of our native plants. Transportation systems have often contributed inadvertently to the spread of these plant species by way of construction and maintenance activities and through the conduits of their interconnected nature. Thus, the spread of invasive non-native plant species by way of our transportation systems has put the ecological balance of our native plant communities at risk. Initial annual funding for this project, year 2000, was at $ 25, 000, which was a National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Grant together with in-kind services provided by the participants. The Adirondack Park, the largest public and private land reserve in the eastern United States, serves as an important ecological and recreational resource for our country. Until recently, the Adirondack Park has been relatively free from the degree of invasion by non-native plants found in other parts of the country. Currently non-native plant species, such as Purple <b>Loosestrife,</b> <b>Common</b> Reed, Japanese Knotweed, are primarily concentrated along transportation corridors, spreading by way of highway-related use and projects. Without efforts to control problem species, the future of many of the natural plant communities, many of which are unique only to the Adirondack Park, will be in jeopardy. For these reasons NYSDOT has joined with The Nature Conservancy, Adirondack Park Agency, Adirondack Student Conservation Association of AmeriCorps, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, and local volunteers to inventory and monitor invasive plant species in an effort to develop a management plan with a GIS database to test control methods to develop a best management practices guide for NYSDOT and the public related to this problem. At working group meetings, this team has identified and prioritized problem species of which require immediate control. ICOET 2003 Proceedings 648 Making Connections The combined efforts of many Agencies and concerned citizens will serve as a front runner to address the influence transportation has on the issue of invasive species and help to maintain the ecological integrity within the Adirondack Park. Further this project will provide valuable information to assist with educational outreach efforts to the public of this problem both within and outside the Adirondack Park. This project is an on going effort that was awarded a Federal Highway Administration 2001 Award for Environmental Excellence in vegetation management...|$|R
