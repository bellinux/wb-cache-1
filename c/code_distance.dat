40|$|Analysis {{of quantum}} error {{correcting}} codes is typically done using a stochastic, Pauli channel error model for describing the noise on physical qubits. However, it was recently found that coherent errors (systematic rotations) on physical data qubits result in {{both physical and}} logical error rates that differ significantly from those predicted by a Pauli model. Here we examine {{the accuracy of the}} Pauli approximation for coherent errors on data qubits under the repetition code. We analytically evaluate the logical error as a function of concatenation level and <b>code</b> <b>distance.</b> We find that coherent errors result in logical errors that are partially coherent and therefore non-Pauli. However, the coherent part of the error is negligible after two or more concatenation levels or at fewer than ϵ^-(d- 1) error correction cycles, where ϵ≪ 1 is the rotation angle error per cycle for a single physical qubit and d is the <b>code</b> <b>distance.</b> These results lend support to the validity of modeling coherent errors using a Pauli channel under some minimum requirements for <b>code</b> <b>distance</b> and/or concatenation.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{fundamental}} {{limits on the}} reliable storage of quantum information in lattices of qubits by deriving tradeoff bounds for approximate quantum error correcting codes. We introduce a notion of local approximate correctability and <b>code</b> <b>distance,</b> and give a number of equivalent formulations thereof, generalizing various exact error-correction criteria. Our tradeoff bounds relate the number of physical qubits n, the number of encoded qubits k, the <b>code</b> <b>distance</b> d, the accuracy parameter δ that quantifies how well the erasure channel can be reversed, and the locality parameter ℓ that specifies the length scale at which the recovery operation can be done. In a regime where the recovery is successful to accuracy ϵ that is exponentially small in ℓ, which {{is the case for}} perturbations of local commuting projector codes, our bound reads kd^ 2 /D- 1 < O(n (n) ^ 2 D/D- 1) for codes on D-dimensional lattices of Euclidean metric. We also find that the <b>code</b> <b>distance</b> of any local approximate code cannot exceed O(ℓ n^(D- 1) /D) if δ< O(ℓ n^- 1 /D). As a corollary of our formulation of correctability in terms of logical operator avoidance, we show that the <b>code</b> <b>distance</b> d and the size d̃ of a minimal region that can support all approximate logical operators satisfies d̃ d^ 1 /D- 1 < O(n ℓ^D/D- 1), where the logical operators are accurate up to O((n δ / d) ^ 1 / 2) in operator norm. Finally, we prove that for two-dimensional systems if logical operators can be approximated by operators supported on constant-width flexible strings, then the dimension of the code space must be bounded. This supports one of the assumptions of algebraic anyon theories, that there exist only finitely many anyon types.

40|$|A {{divisible}} binary classical code is one {{in which}} every code word has weight divisible by a fixed integer. If the divisor is 2 ^ν for a positive integer ν, then one can construct a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code, where X-stabilizer space is the divisible classical code, that admits a transversal gate in the ν-th level of Clifford hierarchy. We consider a generalization of the divisibility by allowing a coefficient vector of odd integers with which every code word has zero dot product modulo the divisor. In this generalized sense, we construct a CSS code with divisor 2 ^ν+ 1 and <b>code</b> <b>distance</b> d from any CSS code of <b>code</b> <b>distance</b> d and divisor 2 ^ν where the transversal X is a nontrivial logical operator. The encoding rate of the new code is approximately d times smaller than that of the old code. In particular, for large d and ν> 2, our construction yields a CSS code of parameters [[O(d^ν- 1), Ω(d),d]] admitting a transversal gate at the ν-th level of Clifford hierarchy. For our construction we introduce a conversion from magic state distillation protocols based on Clifford measurements to those based on codes with transversal T-gates. Our tower contains, as a subclass, generalized triply even CSS codes that have appeared in so-called gauge fixing or code switching methods. Comment: 24 pages, 1 figur...|$|E
40|$|The repair {{locality}} of a distributed storage code is {{the maximum}} number of nodes that ever needs to be contacted during the repair of a failed node. Having small repair locality is desirable, since it is proportional to the number of disk accesses during repair. However, recent publications show that small repair locality comes with a penalty in terms of <b>code</b> <b>distance</b> or storage overhead if exact repair is required. Here, we first review some of the main results on storage codes under various repair regimes and discuss the recent work on possible (information-theoretical) trade-offs between repair locality and other code parameters like storage overhead and <b>code</b> <b>distance,</b> under the exact repair regime. Then we present some new information theoretical lower bounds on the storage overhead {{as a function of the}} repair locality, valid for all common coding and repair models. In particular, we show that if each of the n nodes in a distributed storage system has storage capacity and if, at any time, a failed node can be functionally repaired by contacting some set of r nodes (which may depend on the actual state of the system) and downloading an amount of data from each, then in the extreme cases where = or = r, the maximal coding rate is at most r/(r+ 1) or 1 / 2, respectively (that is, the excess storage overhead is at least 1 /r or 1, respectively).
