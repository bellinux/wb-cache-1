40|$|AbstractThe {{continuing}} {{evolution of}} a variety of laparoscopic instrument and device has been gradually applied to the laparoscopic hepatectomy in many countries. Recent experience has persuaded us that there are great potential benefits derived from laparoscopic hepatectomy and much has been learned about patient selection, the grade of surgical difficulty with respect to tumor location, and the required instrumentation. Among these efforts, various ways of hepatic parenchymal transection with mechanical devices have been attempted and continuing to innovate to perform safe laparoscopic hepatectomy Important technologic developments and improved endoscopic procedures are being established equipment modifications. For safe laparoscopic hepatectomy, {{it is important to have}} all necessary equipment. The intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasonography, microwave <b>coagulators,</b> ultrasonic dissection, argon beam <b>coagulators,</b> laparoscopic coagulation shears, endolinear staplers and TissueLink monopolar sealer are essential. This procedure is in need that well experienced endoscopic surgeon and well-experienced liver surgeon should be collaborated in laparoscopic hepatectomy and the indications are strictly followed based upon the location and size of tumors. Finally critical determinant for success and safe laparoscopic hepatectomy is through familiarity with the relevant laparoscopic instruments and equipments.

The shape of uniform titania nanocrystals in the fractions {{was determined to}} be plate-like; thickness of the platelets was 2 – 3 nm and their lateral sizes differed considerably in the fractions. A rapid partial coagulation and slow sol separation processes were observed after the addition of HCl and KCl to the sols. The rapid coagula-tion threshold was shown to depend essentially on nanoparticles size; the rate of the slow process de-pended strongly on the electrolyte concentration.

40|$|A rotary {{spinning}} process {{is used to}} produce aramide fibers. In this process thin jets of polymer solution emerge from the nozzles of the rotating rotor and flow towards the cylindrical <b>coagulator.</b> At the <b>coagulator</b> the jets hit the water curtain in which they solidify forming fibers. The rotary spinning is described by a steady jet of viscous Newtonian fluid between the rotor and the <b>coagulator.</b> The jet model includes the effects of inertia, longitudinal viscosity, and centrifugal and Coriolis forces. For the jet model the specific type of the boundary conditions depends on the balance between the inertia and viscosity in the momentum transfer through the jet cross-section. Based on that we find two possible flow regimes in rotary spinning: (1) viscous-inertial, where viscosity dominates at the rotor and inertia at the <b>coagulator</b> (2) inertial, where inertia dominates everywhere in the jet. Moreover, there are two situations where spinning is not possible, either {{due to lack of}} a steady-jet solution or because the jet wraps around the rotor.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic {{surgery is}} {{particularly}} {{known for its}} complex technique, which calls for operative analysis of laparoscopic instruments.

RESULTS: The laparoscopic surgeons indicated that <b>coagulators</b> were especially prone to cause complications of the gastro-intestinal tract, vascular injuries, and bile duct injuries. Dissectors were considered {{to play a role}} in the occurrence of solid organ and bile duct injuries, and retractors to cause solid organ injuries. Insufficient functionality of the instruments and insufficient quality of the image were indicated to contribute to the instrument's risks.

30|$|The late 1980 s {{and early}} 1990 s saw the initial {{development}} in advanced gynaecological endoscopic surgery. Surgical techniques, instruments and expertise developed rapidly. The linear cutter stapling device was originally a popular method of securing vascular pedicles. Nezhat et al. [1] described {{the first case}} of laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) using the device to secure uterine vessels. But subsequently there were case reports of ureteric injuries when this device was used to perform the procedure [2, 3]. Bipolar coagulation came to be preferred as the method of choice for securing the uterine vascular pedicles endoscopically. Bipolar <b>coagulators</b> are generally reusable devices that gave them a cost advantage over disposable cutter-stapling devices. However, concern began to arise that collateral spread of thermal energy from bipolar diathermy could result in injury to the ureter. A recent review of ureteric injuries in pelvic laparoscopic surgery found that electrocautery was the most commonly reported technique {{to be associated with}} ureteric injuries, resulting in 50 % more reported injuries than with the use of staples [4]. Cook et al. reported on the evolution of the technique of laparovaginal hysterectomy over the last 13 years in their institution [5]. Their data indicated that their ureteric injury rate more than doubled from 0.3 to 0.7 % since abandoning staples in favour of bipolar diathermy to secure uterine vascular pedicles.|$|R
40|$|Researches {{have been}} {{conducted}} into the causes of acidity of pulp formed in the system of circulating hydraulic ash and slag removal in thermal power plants (TPP) when using coals of Ekibastuz and Karaganda coal fields of the Republic of Kazakhstan. We have carried out a comparative study of combustion of Karazhyra and Maikube coals at the two RK TPPs with BKZ- 75 - 39 FB and BKZ- 160 - 100 FB steam boilers. For ash collection, wet ash collectors with remounted Venturi tube <b>coagulators</b> have been installed on TPP. In them, a chemical interaction of irrigating water with flue gases occurs, which include CO 2, SO 2, SO 3 and ash particles. The ash pulp formed moves to the pipeline, mixes with the slag pulp and is further transported along a tract to the ash dump. We have defined {{the relationship between the}} composition of the products of coal combustion and the formation of acidic pulp in the scrubber. Qualitative and quantitative composition of coals and their combustion products have been determined by the methods of X-ray and X-ray fluorescence analysis. As the analysis showed, the main components of ash and slag materials are the oxides SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3, CaO, MgO, K 2 О, Na 2 O. In the wet ash collectors gaseous substances present in flue gases, are dissolved and hydrolysed in irrigating water.

The condition of mutual unambiguous orientation of patient’s eye and instruments is performed at the initial calculation step by face mounting and movement of coordinate table with optical head. Then such type of patient's eye optical system model is selected that the lens would be combined with the front surface of eye cornea optical system. Pupil of patient eye is under anesthesia. At the final calculation step we determine the functions of optical lens image quality and their values based on medical and technical requirements for {{the components of the}} complex system.

The method of neutralization is optimal for Goldmann lenses.

The use of energy to deliver heat and coagulate target lesions is commonly practiced. This study compares the histologic effects produced on intestinal tissues by two energy-based systems which employ different approaches of heat delivery. Methods: Two heat delivery systems were evaluated in vivo in a single porcine subject: infrared <b>coagulator</b> and bipolar tissue ligator utilizing constant tissue compression and temperature guidance. Eighteen treatment sites divided into three groups of six were assessed. Treatment site temperature was measured {{and the effects of}} thermal treatment in the mucosa, submucosa, submucosal vessels, and muscularis layer were scored. Lateral thermal spread beyond the energy application site was also assessed. Results: Treatment site temperatures were much lower in the bipolar ligator group than in the infrared <b>coagulator</b> group. The mucosal and submucosal tissue changes observed in tissues treated with infrared energy and bipolar energy at 55 &deg;C were similar. Both the mucosal and submucosal tissue changes with bipolar energy at 50 &deg;C were significantly less. Conclusion: Both devices achieved similar histologic results. However, the unique design of the bipolar ligator, which allows consistent capture, constant compression, and temperature monitoring of target tissue, accomplished the desired histologic changes with less muscular damage at much lower temperatures than the infrared <b>coagulator.</b> The use of bipolar ligation could offer clinical advantages such as reduced patient pain and a minimized chance of heat-related collateral tissue damage.
