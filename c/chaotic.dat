5|$|Alongside fractals, {{chaos theory}} ranks as an {{essentially}} universal influence on patterns in nature. There {{is a relationship}} between chaos and fractals—the strange attractors in <b>chaotic</b> systems have a fractal dimension. Some cellular automata, simple sets of mathematical rules that generate patterns, have <b>chaotic</b> behaviour, notably Stephen Wolfram's Rule 30.|$|E
5|$|Lyapunov exponents use {{logarithms}} {{to gauge}} the degree of chaoticity of a dynamical system. For example, for a particle moving on an oval billiard table, even small changes of the initial conditions result in very different paths of the particle. Such systems are <b>chaotic</b> in a deterministic way, because small measurement errors of the initial state predictably lead to largely different final states. At least one Lyapunov exponent of a deterministically <b>chaotic</b> system is positive.|$|E
5|$|The outer planets' orbits are <b>chaotic</b> over longer timescales, with a Lyapunov time in {{the range}} of 2–230million years.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{these two}} rows, the higher {{homotopy}} groups (i > n) {{appear to be}} <b>chaotic,</b> but in fact there are many patterns, some obvious and some very subtle.|$|E
5|$|H. G. Wells' 1898 novel The War of The Worlds {{included}} a <b>chaotic</b> rush to board trains at Liverpool Street as the Martian machines overran military defences in the West End, {{and described the}} crushing of people under {{the wheels of the}} steam engines.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{used for}} chariot warfare {{were not only}} trained for combat conditions, but because many chariots were pulled {{by a team of}} two to four horses, they also had to learn to work {{together}} with other animals in close quarters under <b>chaotic</b> conditions.|$|E
5|$|If enough {{moisture}} exists, thunderstorms {{can form}} along sea breeze fronts that then can send out outflow boundaries. This causes <b>chaotic</b> wind/pressure regimes if the steering flow is weak. Like all other surface features, sea breeze fronts lie inside troughs of low pressure.|$|E
5|$|Irregular {{galaxies are}} <b>chaotic</b> in appearance, and are neither spiral nor elliptical. About {{a quarter of}} all galaxies are irregular, and the {{peculiar}} shapes of such galaxies {{may be the result of}} gravitational interaction.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{wakes up}} wounded on a <b>chaotic</b> street in {{downtown}} New York City. He {{finds himself in}} unfamiliar territory, facing a plaque dedicated in 2021 {{to the victims of}} the September 11 attacks, and is quickly assisted by an officer of the militarized Fringe division.|$|E
5|$|Quneitra was the Syrian {{headquarters}} for the Golan Heights. The Israeli capture of the city occurred in <b>chaotic</b> circumstances on 10 June 1967, {{the last day of}} the Six-Day War. Israeli forces advancing towards Quneitra from the north-west prompted Syrian troops to deploy north of the city, under heavy bombardment, to defend the road to Damascus. At , Syrian radio broadcast an announcement that the city had fallen, though it actually had not. Alarmed, the Syrian Army's redeployment turned into a <b>chaotic</b> retreat along the Damascus road.|$|E
5|$|Rooted in the 1980s {{hardcore}} punk scene, Butthole Surfers {{quickly became}} {{known for their}} <b>chaotic</b> and disturbing live shows, black comedy, and a sound that incorporated elements of psychedelia, noise rock, punk and, later, electronica, {{as well as their}} use of sound manipulation and tape editing.|$|E
5|$|Britney and Kevin: <b>Chaotic</b> is an American reality {{television}} series created by Anthony E. Zuiker. Starring American recording artist Britney Spears and her then-husband Kevin Federline, the five-episode series aired on UPN from May 17 to June 14, 2005. The series chronicles the couple's relationship from their courtship, engagement and wedding.|$|E
5|$|Joyce {{was born}} in 41 Brighton Square, Rathgar, Dublin, into a middle-class family on the way down. A {{brilliant}} student, he briefly attended the Christian Brothers-run O'Connell School before excelling at the Jesuit schools Clongowes and Belvedere, despite the <b>chaotic</b> family life imposed by his father's alcoholism and unpredictable finances. He went on to attend University College Dublin.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May, the {{situation}} in the newly declared State of Israel and the remnants of Palestine was <b>chaotic</b> with the British leaving. The Jewish forces gained advantage over the Arab forces, but they feared the intervention of the Arab armies that had been announced for that day.|$|E
5|$|The Armero {{catastrophe}} came {{shortly after}} the M-19 guerrilla group's raid and subsequent Palace of Justice siege on November 6, worsening an already <b>chaotic</b> situation. After Sánchez's death, blame for it and for the Armero tragedy fell on the Colombian government for its inaction and general indifference to warning signs prior to the volcano's eruption.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{proposed}} to Octavian, the victor of Rome's civil wars, {{that he once}} again assume command of the provinces. The Senate's proposal was a ratification of Octavian's extra-constitutional power. Through the Senate, Octavian was able to continue {{the appearance of a}} still-functional constitution. Feigning reluctance, he accepted a ten-year responsibility of overseeing provinces that were considered <b>chaotic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The small inner moons {{constantly}} perturb each other. The {{system is}} <b>chaotic</b> and apparently unstable. Simulations {{show that the}} moons may perturb each other into crossing orbits, which may eventually result in collisions between the moons. Desdemona may collide with either Cressida or Juliet within the next 100million years.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by London-based group Shynola and released in 2003. The <b>chaotic,</b> surreal video {{was inspired by the}} collage style of old punk fliers. It features footage of the band, animated newspaper headlines, scrapbook paraphernalia, and scenes of military conflicts. Pitchfork listed the video as the 27th best music video of the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Weather is a <b>chaotic</b> {{system that}} is readily {{modified}} by small changes to the environment, so accurate weather forecasting is limited to only a few days. Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.|$|E
25|$|Some {{dynamical}} systems, {{like the}} one-dimensional logistic map defined by x → 4 x (1 – x), are <b>chaotic</b> everywhere, {{but in many}} cases <b>chaotic</b> behavior is found only in a subset of phase space. The cases of most interest arise when the <b>chaotic</b> behavior takes place on an attractor, since then a large set of initial conditions leads to orbits that converge to this <b>chaotic</b> region.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} properties of jerk circuits is the possibility of <b>chaotic</b> behavior. In fact, certain well-known <b>chaotic</b> systems, such as the Lorenz attractor and the Rössler map, are conventionally described as a system of three first-order differential equations that can combine into a single (although rather complicated) jerk equation. Nonlinear jerk systems are in a sense minimally complex systems to show <b>chaotic</b> behaviour; there is no <b>chaotic</b> system involving only two first-order, ordinary differential equations (the system resulting in an equation of second order only).|$|E
25|$|Many {{patterns}} in the Game of Life eventually become a combination of still lifes, oscillators and spaceships; other patterns may be called <b>chaotic.</b> A pattern may stay <b>chaotic</b> {{for a very long}} time until it eventually settles to such a combination.|$|E
25|$|Space- Many {{scenes from}} the novel take place within Anna and her family’s dwelling. The <b>chaotic</b> voice of the {{narrative}} {{is reflected in the}} <b>chaotic</b> way in which the space (in addition to other symbols of familial community, such as food) is shared.|$|E
25|$|For over {{a hundred}} years, {{biologists}} have been keeping track of populations of different species with population models. Most models are continuous, but recently scientists {{have been able to}} implement <b>chaotic</b> models in certain populations. For example, a study on models of Canadian lynx showed there was <b>chaotic</b> behavior in the population growth. Chaos can also be found in ecological systems, such as hydrology. While a <b>chaotic</b> model for hydrology has its shortcomings, there is still much to learn from looking at the data through the lens of chaos theory. Another biological application is found in cardiotocography. Fetal surveillance is a delicate balance of obtaining accurate information while being as noninvasive as possible. Better models of warning signs of fetal hypoxia can be obtained through <b>chaotic</b> modeling.|$|E
