We examined whether blocking AMPA receptor desensitisation with <b>cyclothiazide</b> would modify this response. <b>Cyclothiazide</b> strongly potentiated the combined AMPA/(1 S, 3 R) - 1 -aminocyclopentane- 1, 3 -dicarboxylic acid (ACPD) -evoked release of arachidonic acid (EC 50 of approximately 7 microM) {{but did not}} modulate the basal, ACPD, or NMDA response. The enhanced liberation of arachidonic acid, observed {{in the presence of}} <b>cyclothiazide,</b> was due to the appearance of a genuine AMPA response that was independent of an associative {{activation of}} metabotropic receptors. The potentiated and nonpotentiated AMPA responses were inhibited by both competitive [2, 3 -di-hydroxy- 6 -nitro- 7 -sulphamoylbenzo (f) quinoxaline] and 2, 3 -benzodiazepine noncompetitive (GYKI 53655 and GYKI 52466) receptor antagonists. <b>Cyclothiazide</b> was equally effective at potentiating the AMPA response in either {{the presence or absence of}} glucose, suggesting that the increased glutamate-evoked arachidonic acid release observed in these cells under conditions of glucose deprivation is not due to reduced AMPA receptor desensitisation.

AMPA (1 – 1000 [*]μM) stimulated the release of [3 H]-noradrenaline in a concentration-dependent manner that was both calcium-dependent and tetrodotoxin-sensitive, and attenuated by the AMPA-selective antagonists, NBQX (1 and 10 [*]μM), LY 293558 (1 and 10 [*]μM) and GYKI 52466 (10 and 30 [*]μM). By use of an experimental procedure with consecutive applications of AMPA (100 [*]μM, 28 [*]min apart), the second response was reduced, indicative of receptor desensitization, and was reversed by <b>cyclothiazide</b> in a concentration-dependent manner (1 – 300 [*]μM). The concentration-response curve for AMPA-induced release of [3 H]-noradrenaline was shifted leftwards, but the reversal by <b>cyclothiazide</b> of the desensitized response was partial and failed to reach the maximal response of the first stimulus. Observations made with various schedules of <b>cyclothiazide</b> application indicated that the initial AMPA-evoked response was already partially desensitized (150 % potentiation by 100 [*]μM <b>cyclothiazide)</b> and that the desensitization was {{not likely to be}} due to a time-dependent diminution and was long-lasting (second application of <b>cyclothiazide</b> was ineffective).

Additionally, while dose dependently, 5 – 25 μM <b>cyclothiazide</b> in the presence of AMPA is highly neurotoxic, IDRA- 21 (up to 100 μM) is devoid of neurotoxicity.

40|$|Within {{the area}} tempestas (AT) in the {{anterior}} piriform cortex, unilateral microinfusions of GABA receptor antagonists and glutamate receptor agonists trigger brief episodic limbic seizures. In the present study, we document a synergistic effect of coinfusing bicuculline (GABAA receptor antagonist) with either carbachol (muscarinic receptor agonist) or <b>cyclothiazide</b> (inhibitor of AMPA receptor desensitization) {{but not with}} glutamate receptor agonists (AMPA, NMDA or kainate) in the rat AT. In particular, coadministration of bicuculline (118 pmol) with either carbachol (328 pmol) or <b>cyclothiazide</b> (1. 2 nmol) triggered continuous self-sustaining seizures (status epilepticus; SE). <b>Cyclothiazide</b> alone did not evoke seizures. Although blockade of NMDA receptors with AP- 7 (100 or 500 pmol) prevented episodic seizures evoked by carbachol or bicuculline alone, it was without effect on the continuous seizures evoked by combined treatments. NMDA-insensitive self-sustaining seizures were also evoked by the combination of AMPA and <b>cyclothiazide.</b> Regardless of the mechanism by which SE was evoked, it was prevented only by an AMPA receptor antagonist, NBQX, thus reinforcing the crucial role of AMPA receptors in the transition to SE. Further evidence for AMPA receptor regulation of seizure severity came from the overexpression of the GluR 1 AMPA receptor subunit in AT. This resulted in substantially increased severity of bicuculline-evoked seizures that was reversed by focal application of NBQX. Thus, desensitization of AMPA receptors appears to limit the duration and severity of seizure activity, and a failure of this mechanism, or an overabundance of slowly desensitizing AMPA receptors, predisposes to severe and prolonged seizures...|$|E

This difference was evident in recordings carried out at 22 and 32 °C and with different solutions in the clamp pipette. The larger effect of <b>cyclothiazide</b> on EPSCs was unaffected by blockade of GABA and NMDA receptors. Two-dimensional current source density analyses derived from 64 recording sites were used to provide extracellular estimates of AMPA receptor mediated synaptic currents. With this method, <b>cyclothiazide</b> again had much smaller effects than were obtained with whole cell clamp. Differences between whole cell and extracellular recordings were present, although not as pronounced, for the ampakines, a class of drugs that slow both deactivation and desensitization of AMPA receptors.

Many compounds {{were found to}} be more potent than the reference compounds diazoxide and aniracetam as potentiators of the AMPA current in rat cortex mRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes. The most active compound, 4 -ethyl- 2, 3 -dihydro- 4 H-pyrido[3, 2 -e]- 1, 2, 4 -thiadiazine 1, 1 -dioxide (31 b), revealed an in vitro activity on Xenopus oocytes not far from that of <b>cyclothiazide,</b> the most potent allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors reported to date. Moreover, 31 b, but not <b>cyclothiazide,</b> was found to potentiate the duration and the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic field potentials induced by electric stimulation in rat hippocampal slices. Such an effect could indicate, for 31 b, but not for <b>cyclothiazide,</b> a possible interaction with postsynaptic AMPA receptor binding sites located on hippocampal CA 1 neurons. Structure-activity relationships indicated that the structural requirements responsible for a biological activity on AMPA receptors are different from those responsible for an inhibitory activity on the insulin releasing process (putative ATP-sensitive K+-channel openers). For instance, 31 b and other related dihydropyridothiadiazines {{were found to be}} ineffective as inhibitors of insulin release from rat pancreatic B-cells, in contrast to diazoxide and known pyridothiadiazines reported as ATP-sensitive K+-channel openers. Conversely, the pyridothiadiazines active on B-cells were found to be ineffective as potentiators of the AMPA currents in Xenopus oocytes. Thus, 31 b appeared to be more specific than diazoxide as an AMPA receptor modulator. This compound may be considered as a new pharmacological tool, different from diazoxide and <b>cyclothiazide,</b> for studying AMPA receptors. Moreover, 31 b can also constitute a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of cognitive disorders. In VitroJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

PEPA dose-dependently potentiated AMPA-induced increase of [Ca 2 +]i. In 90 % (72 out of 80) of the cells in which <b>cyclothiazide</b> acts, PEPA potentiated the increased [Ca 2 +]i induced by AMPA with pronounced cell-to-cell variation in rat hippocampal cultures. The ratio of the potentiation by PEPA to the potentiation by <b>cyclothiazide</b> (P/C ratio) also varied with cells between 0 and 2. 15. It was found that the cultured hippocampal cells consisted of multiple populations with different P/C ratios. Among them two populations exhibited characteristic P/C ratios; low (0 to 0. 15; 27 out of 80 cells, 34 %) and high (⩾ 2. 00; 1 out of 80 cells, 1 %) P/C ratios. The P/C ratios of the other populations were between 0. 25 and 1. 20, and these cells constituted 65 % (52 out of 80 cells) of the cells tested. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested that GluR 2 -flip, GluR 1 -flip, GluR 2 -flop, and GluR 1 -flop were abundantly expressed (in this rank order) in the cultures used. In Xenopus oocytes expressing GluR 1, GluR 3, or these subunits plus GluR 2, the potentiation of AMPA response by PEPA and by <b>cyclothiazide</b> varied with subunit and splice-variant combinations, and the P/C ratio was between 0. 19 and 2. 20. Oocytes with low P/C ratios (0. 19 to 0. 50) and low sensitivity to PEPA potentiation (1. 9 fold to 6. 41 fold) were those expressing flip variants predominantly, and oocytes with high P/C ratios (1. 8 to 2. 2) were those expressing flop variants predominantly. Oocytes with intermediate P/C ratios (0. 51 to 1. 20) were those expressing various combinations of flip and flop variants, and it was impossible to specify the relative abundance of flip and flop variants in these cells. Therefore, the P/C ratio can be used to infer subunit/splice variant expression only when the ratio is low or high.

When the desensitization of AMPA receptors was blocked by <b>cyclothiazide</b> we monitored {{a dramatic increase in}} both [Ca 2 +]i and 45 Ca 2 + uptake after application of AMPA in both types of neurons with much higher responses in cortical cells. Application of <b>cyclothiazide</b> induced [Ca 2 +]i oscillations in single cortical neurons, probably indicating <b>cyclothiazide</b> amplification of AMPA receptor activation by endogenously released glutamate. We found that AMPA receptor blockade by novel uncompetitive antagonist GYKI 52466 could be overcome by increasing concentrations of <b>cyclothiazide</b> indicating that the two compounds may act via allosterically connected binding sites on the AMPA receptor. Kainate-elevated [Ca 2 +]i was also antagonised by GYKI 52466, although not completely, with the remaining GYKI 52466 -insensitive fraction of kainate-induced [Ca 2 +]i probably due to activation of native kainate receptors. Further we also characterised AM PA receptor-induced activator protein (AP- 1) transcri ption factor DNA binding. Stimulation of AMPA receptors induced AP- 1 transcription factor activation both in the presence and absence of <b>cyclothiazide.</b> However, in the presence of <b>cyclothiazide</b> the maximal AP- 1 binding activity was higher and was reached faster. Application of AMPA alone activated an AP- 1 complex consisting of c-Fos and Jun D protein dimers. <b>Cyclothiazide</b> co-application induced an AP- 1 complex in which the c-Fos and Jun D proteins were accompanied by c-Jun. Fos B and Jun B. These data suggest that blockade of AMPA receptor desensitization may produce both quantitative and qualitative changes in AMPA receptor-mediated glutamate effects on gene transcription. AMPA receptors may mediate glutamate neurotoxicity. To study this phenomenon, we analysed effects of AMPA receptor overactivation by using various measurements for apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Our results clearly demonstrate that AMPA receptors may be involved in the neurotoxic effects of glutamate in situations where the desensitization of AMPA receptors is impaired. AMPA receptor mediated toxicity display morphologically distinct features of both necrosis and apoptosis in the same cell population. Similar to other neuronal systems, the rate of AMPA receptor desensitization may be regulated intracellularly. Based on this assumption we examined effects of impaired energy production on AMPA-induced neurotoxicity and Ca 2 + fluxes in cerebellar granule cells. No toxic effects were observed when either AMPA or low concentrations of inhibitor of oxydative phosphorylation, NaCN, were applied alone. In contrast, co-application of these compounds produced both necrotic and apoptotic cell death preceded by a pronounced elevation of [Ca 2 +]i suggesting that metabolic inhibition had increased the responsiveness of AMPA receptors, possibly by interferring with the rate of desensitization. Finally, we tested the possibilities for functional modulation of glutamate signaling by other transmitter systems down-stream of the ionotropic glutamate receptors, by monitoring the functional responses to NMDA and AMPA receptor stimulation in granule cells pre-exposed to M cholinoreceptor agonist carbachol. Carbachol pre-treatment potentiated both AMPA- and NMDA-induced AP- 1 DNA binding but not 45 Ca 2 + uptake or neurotoxicity, suggesting that some signaling pathways are sensitized by chronic muscarinic receptor stimulation. These pathways appear to be located down-stream of NMDA and AMPA receptor-controlled cation channels and may be specifically involved in glutamate-mediated regulation of transcription factor activity. In conclusion, activation of AMPA receptors is short-lasting because of the rapid receptor desensitization. Blockade of desensitization dramaticaly enhances AMPA receptor-mediated responses. At least partially, the rate of desensitization may be modulated from within the cell, probably via an energy-dependent mechanism. In energetically compromised neurons normal rate of AMPA receptor desensitization can not be maintained resulting in Ca 2 + overload and neuronal death. Finally, even when the rate of AMPA receptor desensitization is constant, the strength of glutamate effects via AMPA receptors is dependent on the responsiveness of signaling pathways down-stream of AMPA receptors...|$|E

CTZ (100 µM) made the period of tonic-like discharges (161 ± 18 % of control) and the whole SLE (151 ± 15 % of control) longer (in 7 out of 9 slices), or induced endless SLE by stabilizing clonic-like bursting (in 2 out of 9 slices). 30 µM CTZ had no significant effects on SLE dynamics (N= 4), while 300 µM CTZ induced endless SLEs in 4 out of 8 slices. Co-application of CTZ (100 µM) with 100 µM GYKI 52466, the allosteric inhibitor of AMPA receptor function restrained the effects of CTZ and shortened SLEs and their tonic phases to 37 ± 4. 2 % and 47 ± 4. 2 % of the control, respectively. Effects of GYKI- 52466 and GYKI- 52466 with CTZ on SLE dynamics were indistinguishable. 50 µM 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) alone (N= 5) or in combination with CTZ (N= 6) transformed recurrent SLE pattern into incessant epileptiform activity with patterns distinguishable from those under 100 µM CTZ application. The effect of 4 -AP may suggest a role for facilitated presynaptic glutamate release in disrupting recurrent dynamics. In contrast, the self-similar slow-down of low-[Mg 2 +]-induced SLE dynamics by CTZ indicate AMPA receptor desensitization as a parameter shaping SLEs. Page 3 of 28...|$|E

We decided to {{examine the effect of}} testosterone on excitotoxic death of oligodendrocytes because a gender difference exists in the incidence and disease course of multiple sclerosis. Short-term pure cultures of oligodendrocytes (4 days in vitro) were exposed to a brief pulse with kainate or AMPA + <b>cyclothiazide</b> for the induction of excitotoxicity. Exposure to testosterone enantate was slightly toxic per se and amplified both AMPA and kainate toxicity. Testosterone treatment induced all gene targets of p 53, and amplified the induction of these genes induced by kainate. The effect of testosterone was mediated by the activation of androgen receptors and was resistant to the aromatase inhibitors, DL-aminoglutethimide and 4 -hydroxyandrost- 4 -ene- 3, 17 -dione. Testosterone treatment also potentiated the stimulation of 45 Ca 2 + influx induced by AMPA + <b>cyclothiazide</b> or kainate without changing the expression of the glutamate receptor (GluR) 1, - 2 / 3, and - 4 subunits of AMPA receptors or the GluR 6 / 7 subunits of kainate receptors.

40|$|Abstract—AMPA receptors form a major {{subdivision}} of the glutamate receptor {{family that}} mediates excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. Currents through AMPA receptors can be up- or down-regulated by compounds that allosterically modulate receptor kinetics through binding sites distinct from that for glutamate. One of those modulators is the benzothiadiazide IDRA- 21 {{which has been}} reported to enhance synaptic transmission and be effective in behavioral tests, but typically requires threshold concentrations of at least 100 mM to be active in vitro. In this study, new benzothiadiazides were developed with IDRA- 21 as lead compound and examined for their potency in modulating AMPA receptor kinetics. A significant increase in drug affinity was obtained by alkyl substitution at the 5 0 -position of IDRA- 21; substitutions at other positions of the benzothiadiazide core generally did not yield a further gain in affinity and in some cases abolished drug binding. The 5 0 -ethyl derivative exhibited an EC 50 value in the order of 22 mM which represents about a 30 -fold gain in affinity over that of IDRA- 21. The EC 50 value is comparable to that of <b>cyclothiazide,</b> the most potent benzothiadiazide drug, but the effects on AMPA receptors differed substantially between these two compounds in that the 5 0 -ethyl derivative of IDRA- 21 greatly increased the binding affinity for receptor agonists whereas <b>cyclothiazide</b> is known to reduce agonist binding. The structure–activity relationships reported here thus offer to provide new insights how receptor kinetics is linked to particular aspects of receptor–drug interactions. # 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E

Amongst ionotropic receptors responding to glutamate, the AMPA subtype has been considered as essential for the fast excitatory neurotransmission in {{the central nervous system}} and the expression and maintenance of long-term potentiation. As glutamate is known to be involved in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, AMPA receptors seem to represent interesting targets to develop therapeutic drugs. Hence, the enhancement of AMPA signals is an approach currently investigated for the management of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia or mood disorders. In particular, many efforts are being conducted in the development of AMPA positive allosteric modulators ("potentiators"), which alter the rate of receptor desensitization. The major chemical families developed as AMPA potentiators are aniracetam derivatives, <b>cyclothiazide</b> derivatives and biarylpropylsulfonamides derivatives. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Bath application of <b>cyclothiazide</b> (CTZ, 100 μm) significantly increased the amplitude of EPSCs mediated by α-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. <b>Cyclothiazide</b> increased the magnitude of paired-pulse depression of both AMPA-EPSCs (intervals, 50 and 500 ms) and NMDA-EPSCs (interval, 20 ms). In low Ca 2 +, high Mg 2 + solution, CTZ decreased the number of failures and increased the mean amplitude of AMPA-EPSCs more than three-fold. Presynaptic Ca 2 + currents and K+ currents were directly recorded from the calyceal nerve terminals. These currents were attenuated by CTZ in a reversible manner. The magnitude of inhibition of presynaptic K+ currents by CTZ (100 μm) was comparable to that by 5 μm 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP). Both CTZ and 4 -AP slowed the repolarizing phase of presynaptic action potentials. The inhibitory effects of CTZ on presynaptic ion channels were mimicked by a solution having reduced Ca 2 + concentration and 5 μm 4 -AP. This solution facilitated EPSCs, but the magnitude of facilitation was significantly less than that caused by CTZ. In the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), CTZ increased the mean frequency of miniature EPSCs three-fold. CTZ prolonged their decay time but {{had no effect on}} their amplitude. The facilitatory effect of CTZ on the miniature frequency was neither blocked by a protein kinase C inhibitor nor occluded by phorbol ester, suggesting that a distinct mechanism underlies the effect of CTZ.
