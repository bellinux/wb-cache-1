After that mix the brake lining material in accordance with a predetermined composition. Then given the pressure while heated (sintering) with a load of 7. 5 tons for 7 minutes with a variation of sintering time of 60 minutes, 90 minutes and 120 minutes, with a temperature of 250 ºC. Then tested friction with a load of 15 kg for 60 minutes with dry test, spraying of water, with a standard testing SNI 09 - 2663 - 1992 then calculated wear and coefficient geseknya, and tested by using a Durometer hardness. From the research that the average wear of the brake lining Indopart lower and better than the brake with the sintering time variation in the friction test for 60 minutes. The coefficient of friction brake Indopart higher than the brake with the variation of sintering time on tests of friction for 60 minutes, the coefficient of friction Indopart high of 0. 6708 while approaching at 0. 6357 on the brake with a variation of 60 minutes at a temperature of 250 ° C on a test dry, Hardness values Indopart brake better than the brake with the variation of sintering time was 94 shored up, while the value of hardness approaching the brake with the variation of sintering time of 60 minutes dengn sintering temperature of 250 ° C for 88 shored Keywords: brake, sintering time, swipe test, hardnes...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we examine the setting of offer prices for Australian {{industrial}} initial public offers (IPOs) by fixed price offers. Our investigation focuses on the associations between offer prices and both market prices and accounting based measures of intrinsic value. Fixed-price offers {{are less likely to}} be influenced by <b>the</b> <b>canvassing</b> of <b>market</b> demand when compared to the US setting, where book-builds are typically used. We conclude that while Australian industrial IPOs are underpriced, they are not systematically undervalued. Contrary to research undertaken by Purnanandam and Swaminathan in the US book-build setting, we do not conclude that Australian IPOs are systematically overvalued. As part of our analysis, we develop an empirical model of offer prices based on interviews with several leading Australian stockbrokers involved in setting them. Finally, using the ratio of offer price to intrinsic value measure, we find some evidence that undervaluation is positively related to underpricing. ...|$|R
