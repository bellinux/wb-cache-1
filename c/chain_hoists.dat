5|$|The main {{speakers}} may be 'flown' {{from the}} ceiling of a venue on <b>chain</b> <b>hoists,</b> and 'flying points' (i.e., attachment points) are built into many professional loudspeaker enclosures. Subwoofers can be flown or stacked on the ground near the stage. There can be more than 50 double-18-inch (45cm) cabinets in a typical concert system. Just as consumer subwoofer enclosures can be made of Medium-density fibreboard (MDF), Oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, plastic or other dense material, professional subwoofer enclosures can be built from the same materials. MDF is commonly used to construct subwoofers for permanent installations as its density is relatively high and weatherproofing is not a concern. Other permanent installation subwoofers have used very thick plywood: the Altec 8182 (1981) used 7-ply 28mm birch-faced oak plywood. Touring subwoofers are typically built from 18–20mm thick void-free Baltic birch (Betula pendula or Betula pubescens) plywood from Finland, Estonia or Russia; such plywood affords greater strength for frequently transported enclosures. Not naturally weatherproof, Baltic birch is coated with carpet, thick paint or spray-on truck bedliner to give the subwoofer enclosures greater durability.|$|E

50|$|The grid deck, {{gridiron}} deck, or grid, is a permeable {{working surface}} {{present at the}} top of many fly lofts that is used to support and provide access to many of a rigging system's components. Though originally constructed of wood, down-facing three-inch steel channels with three-inch gaps became the prevalent grid decking in the 20th century. Today, large-opening heavy-duty steel bar grating is most common in new theatres. The grid deck surface is usually rated to support live loads as well as all anticipated dead-hung equipment and hemp and motorized (e.g., <b>chain</b> <b>hoist)</b> spot rigging. Its permeability facilitates the mounting of equipment and the passing of lift lines and electrical cables. Spot rigging is not feasible without a grid.|$|R

5000|$|A {{single point}} or single buoy mooring {{system is a}} {{facility}} for loading and unloading petroleum products to tankers, which moor to them only by the bow.

A range of single point mooring configurations are in use, and installation, maintenance and inspection work on all types is commonly done by divers. The work may include placing the pipeline end manifold (PLEM) and connecting it to the submarine pipelines, installing anchor chains and checking and adjusting chain angles, installing the submarine hoses between the PLEM and the buoy, installing a ships mooring system and operating subsea valves. The work is likely to involve the use of winches and cranes, rigging, including use of tirfors, <b>chain</b> <b>hoists,</b> strops and spreaders, flanging, using wrenches, hammers and gaskets, oxy-arc burning and welding.|$|E

40|$|Unpredictable {{fracture}} of round steel link chains reduce the economic {{efficiency of the}} machines they are used in and increase the hazard potential for the operating personnel. In order to reduce such incidents appropriate measures for early detection are needed to determine an optimum time of repair or replacement. By steadily increasing strain, the currently applied, discontinuous and manually performed control processes does not present a satisfactory solution. They should be supplemented with new, {{the current state of}} the art considering approaches. This thesis addresses these issues and depicts the evaluation results of an individually developed measurement system for chains including the acquisition and processing of lifetime related variables. The focus hereby lies on standardized round steel link chains, which are preferably used in mining or in the hoisting equipment. Relevant damages to chains can be largely attributed to mechanical overstress of the base material. Typical damage patterns are fatigue fractures and forced fractures that are favoured depending on the environmental conditions, through wear and corrosion. As well-proven approach to estimate the remaining lifetime, the method of calculation of service strength was established. In adaptation to the use case chain, a component specific S-N curve and a nominal-stress-time-curve associated to collective stress are required. Subsequently, both are linked by the linear damage accumulation hypothesis. The chain specific S-N curve was created on the basis of previous trials of WBK Seilprüfstelle. The conducted dynamic fatigue trials respect a wide range of standardized chain sizes and rely on two different load assumptions. Thus a weighted consideration of the real load conditions is possible. By using the two parametric Markov counting algorithm, the collective normal stress will be calculated. Essential for this is an accurate load-time-curve that comprises of the real surrounding conditions precisely. For an accurate determination of the replacement state, the generated collective must represent the complete history of the chain link. This important requirement can only be achieved by a constantly working measurement system, which is directly connected to the focused link over the entire service life. A market research concerning established and free accessible measurement systems for chains revealed no satisfactory solution also complying with the elaborate chain specific requests. For this purpose, the development of a customized measurement system was focus of the public funded research project i-MaSS (integrated machine sensor system). For the integration of the miniaturized and energy-efficient prototypes in the chain strand, customized adapters are required. With regard to the minimal installation space available a conceptual division respective to the layout took place here. For chains with a wire gauge ≥ 30 mm (preferable mining chains) the developed adapter element looks like a stud chain link with a borehole in the middle. Wire gauges < 30 mm (e. g. hoisting chains) can not house the measurement systems directly as a consequence of the filigree geometry. In this regard an alternative solution was designed which can be mounted in the flow of force at the end of the chain strand. The testing of each adapter variant was performed on different test rigs for mining and hoisting chains separately. For the considered use case mining chain static test series were carried on a horizontally operating tension testing machine; dynamic analyses on a close to reality but unloaded armoured face conveyor test bench. The results obtained depict a linear and reproducible transmission behaviour of the complete measurement chain. The for <b>chain</b> <b>hoists</b> designed concept was trialled on a seven meter high test tower under realistic conditions. Hereby, the performed static and dynamic test series reveal a satisfying transmission behaviour, which is furthermore repeatable and analytically traceable. All test bench trials achieved acceptable results for both developed measurement concepts. Therefore, they can be used as a practicable tool for determining the load-time-curve of adequate quality. In conjunction with the deduced and for chains adapted calculation of service strength, it is now possible to estimate the remaining life time of standardized round link chains of different size more precisely...|$|E

This entailed a calculation of extreme precision, one that was worked out by Fite and his neighbor Berthel Wrolsen, a local man who was a self-taught engineering genius and an unofficial consultant to Fite on many structural issues over the years. The calculations were especially difficult in that {{the top of the}} monolith is not only wider than the base, but also asymmetrical.
