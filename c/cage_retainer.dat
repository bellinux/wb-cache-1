40|$|Except in {{the near}} Earth phase of GIOTTO's mission to Comet Halley, the HGA (high gain antenna) on board GIOTTO was the only {{designed}} means of up/down communications. The spacecraft spin stabilization required that the HGA be despun at the same rotational rate of nominally 15 rpm {{in order to keep}} the HGA pointing accurately to a Earth. A dual servomotor despin mechanism was designed and built by SEP of France for this purpose. The expected thermal environment suggested that dry lubrication was preferable to wet for the ball bearings but there existed no relevant data on the torque noise spectrum of candidate solid lubricants. Therefore ad hoc torque noise tests were run with two solid lubricants: ion plated lead film plus lead bronze <b>cage</b> (<b>retainer)</b> and a PTFE composite cage only. The lead lubrication showed the better spectrum up to the mission lifetime point so it was selected for continued test over some 20 times the Halley mission life, with periodic torque spectrum monitoring. The spectrum remained well within the pointing error budget over the 100 million revolutions covered...|$|E

A {{sudden failure}} of the bearing of the {{turbocharger}} shaft in a diesel engine, {{with the power of}} 11520 KW and the total running time of 2, 417 h, is investigated in this paper. Based on an examination of the disassembled turbocharger and a residue analysis, {{it was found that the}} {{failure of the}} turbocharger originated from a fatigue fracture of an aluminum-alloy bearing <b>retainer</b> (<b>cage)</b> on its compressor side. The axial load was a chief cause of the fatigue fracture and the looseness defects in the aluminum alloy retainer deteriorated its fatigue strength which in turn accelerated the development of fatigue cracks. After the retainer broke, the off-centered rotation of the turbocharger shaft triggered a severe impact and led to deformation, wear and a fracture of the bearing parts, ultimately resulting in the failure of the turbocharger...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of wear and friction properties {{of a number}} of materials sliding against SAE 52100 steel was conducted. These materials included brass, bronze, beryllium copper, monel, nichrome v, 24 s-t aluminum, nodular iron, and gray cast iron. The metals investigated may be useful as possible <b>cage</b> (separator or <b>retainer)</b> materials for rolling-contact bearings of high-speed turbine engines. The ability of materials to form surface films that prevent welding is a most important factor in both dry friction and boundary lubrication. On the basis of wear and resistance to welding only, the cast irons were the most promising materials investigated; they showed the least wear and the least tendency to surface failure when run dry, and when boundary lubricated they showed the highest load capacity. On the basis of mechanical properties, nodular iron is superior to gray cast iron. Bronze had the lowest friction coefficient under dry sliding conditions. The results with brass, beryllium copper, and aluminum were poor and these materials do not appear, with regard to friction and wear, to be suitable for cages...|$|R
40|$|Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) {{technology}} {{allows the}} fabrication of small mechanical systems in silicon using standard micro-fabrication pro- cesses. MEMS techniques have found wide acceptance in such devices as ac- celerometers, micro-mirrors, resonators, probes, and micro-tweezers {{to name a}} few. Though small linear motions are common in MEMS applications, few devices exhibit reliable rotary motion. This work explores several methods of fabricating rotary bearings using micro-balls as the support mechanism. Micro-ball bearings have several advantages over other MEMS bearing tech- nologies in that they provide robust mechanical support, require no external control systems, and basic designs require very few fabrication steps. Ball <b>cages</b> or <b>retainers</b> are common in macro-scale bearings, providing uniform spacing between the balls. Several cage designs are proposed and explored in this work: a radial ball bearing with an integrated ball cage, a dual-row style cage, and ve unique cage geometries integrated into silicon micro-turbines (SMTs.) Also, {{an example of a}} curved or angular contact race- way is presented as an example of this type of raceway geometry in MEMS devices. Each is presented with a discussion of the design considerations and fabrication process. This is followed by a characterization of the performance of each design. These studies found that the integrated cage in the radial ball bearing performs well at speeds ranging up to 20 000 RPM. Minimal wear was ob- served after 6 hours of continuous testing. However, the solder bond in the cage was a common failure point in these devices, limiting the reliability and longevity. The dual groove style cage was designed to eliminate the solder bond. However, the higher frictional forces between the ball and the cage in this design resulted in higher losses during operation. Taking into account the higher losses and the added complexity of the design, it seems unlikely that this approach would be appropriate for further study. However, the design does represent a novel approach for releasing multi-wafer rotary structures and is presented here as example of this technique. Testing of the cage de- signs for the SMTs indicated that a full ring design (a full annulus with holes for the balls) performed the best of the 5 cage geometries. However, these devices do not perform as well as cage-less designs for high speed applications due to higher ctional forces and increased raceway wear at the interface be- tween the ball and the raceway edge. Finally, the curved raceway has shown excellent performance up to 2500 RPM with normal loads up to 40 mN in tribometer testing. SMTs with this raceway desing were also tested for over 10 million revolutions and at speeds over 70 000 RPM. The test results for all of the bearings designs presented here show that the devices exhibit stable operation at low to moderately high speeds. Open Acces...|$|R
