25|$|The drier {{areas of}} heath have a grassy character, with typical species being {{matgrass}} (Nardus stricta) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). <b>Common</b> <b>tormentil</b> (Potentilla erecta), dovesfoot cranesbill (Geranium molle), heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile), heath milkwort (Polygala serpyllifolia) and heath rush (Juncus squarrosus) {{have also been}} recorded, as has the locally rare bird's-foot (Ornithopus perpusillus) and shepherd's cress (Teesdalia nudicaulis).|$|E
25|$|The fell is {{actively}} managed by Durham County Council, {{in an effort}} to maintain a broad range of heathland species, including such desirable species as heath bedstraw, Galium saxatile, and <b>common</b> <b>tormentil,</b> Potentilla erecta. Bracken is particularly troublesome because it crowds out the heather and associated species. The County Council has used a combination of burning and selective herbicides to control the bracken, and in 2007 embarked on a three-year trial of a more environmentally-friendly method, using heavy horses to pull a roller that crushes the bracken.|$|E
50|$|Adults can {{be found}} from June to October, when they visit yellow {{composites}} such as Hieracium, flowers of <b>Common</b> <b>Tormentil</b> (Potentilla erecta), heather (Calluna) and Cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix).|$|E
50|$|On {{the slopes}} of Kilham Hill are {{the remains of a}} shielling, which {{provided}} shelter for shepherds watching over the sheep as they grazed. In summer the hillside is a profusion of purple and blue as wild thyme, cross-leaved heath and harebells come into bloom; foxgloves have colonised the stony ground. A stone cairn crowns the summit, and was found to conceal a Bronze Age cist containing burnt bones. From the summit, there are views over the Milfield Plain, Glendale and the Till Valley, and to Eildon Hill, Yeavering Bell and the Cheviot Hills. Buzzards, kestrels, lapwings and curlews are <b>common,</b> while bilberry, <b>tormentil</b> and heath bedstraw carpet the soil.|$|R
5000|$|Potentilla erecta (syn. Tormentilla erecta, Potentilla laeta, Potentilla tormentilla, {{known as}} the (<b>common)</b> <b>tormentil,</b> septfoil or erect {{cinquefoil}} [...] ) is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the rose family (Rosaceae).|$|E
50|$|Cuscuta europaea L., the European dodder, is {{reported}} to contain 30,000 ppm in the root. Phlobaphenes can be extracted from {{the root of the}} <b>common</b> <b>tormentil</b> (Potentilla erecta) as tormentil red.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{species are}} called tormentils, {{though this is}} often used {{specifically}} for <b>common</b> <b>tormentil</b> (P. erecta). Others {{are referred to as}} [...] "barren strawberries", which may also refer to P. sterilis in particular, or to the closely related but not congeneric Waldsteinia fragarioides.|$|E
50|$|Some {{species are}} used in herbalism. <b>Common</b> <b>tormentil</b> (P. erecta), for example, {{has been used as}} an herbal remedy for {{inflammation}} and gastrointestinal disorders. Research continues to determine its safety and usefulness as an alternative medicine for such disorders as ulcerative colitis. Potentilla discolor and P. multifida are Chinese medicinal herbs used to treat diabetes.|$|E
50|$|The drier {{areas of}} heath have a grassy character, with typical species being {{matgrass}} (Nardus stricta) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). <b>Common</b> <b>tormentil</b> (Potentilla erecta), dovesfoot cranesbill (Geranium molle), heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile), heath milkwort (Polygala serpyllifolia) and heath rush (Juncus squarrosus) {{have also been}} recorded, as has the locally rare bird's-foot (Ornithopus perpusillus) and shepherd's cress (Teesdalia nudicaulis).|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} of the bogs {{depends on}} the type and location. Blanket bog, which forms on the highest land where the rainfall exceeds 2000 mm a year, consists mainly of cotton-grass (Eriophorum species), sedges (Carex and Rhynchospora), Bog Asphodel and <b>Common</b> <b>Tormentil,</b> with Sphagnum thriving in the wettest patches. The valley bogs have lush growth of rushes, with sphagnum, cross-leaved heath, sundews and several other species.|$|E
50|$|The {{vascular}} plants {{characteristic of}} raised bogs (an {{example is the}} Bog of Allen) include: common heather, cross-leaved heath, bell heather, bogbean, hare's-tail cottongrass, common cottongrass, bog-rosemary, common cranberry, bog asphodel, bog myrtle, Pedicularis sylvatica, round-leaved sundew, oblong-leaved sundew, great sundew, royal fern, species of Utricularia, Juncus squarrosus, <b>common</b> <b>tormentil,</b> black bogrush, bog orchid, Euphrasia scottica, heath bedstraw, green-ribbed sedge, little green sedge, black crowberry, moor matgrass, soft rush, northern firmoss and wolf's-foot clubmoss.|$|E
50|$|The upper part, {{which has}} good views across west London, is managed as a park {{and has a}} {{football}} pitch. The lower slopes are less managed, with grassland, hedgerows marking former field boundaries, scattered trees, and areas of creeping thistle. A small stream, probably a tributary of Burnt Oak Brook, flows from a spring fed pond, which has a rich wetland flora. Wild flowers include devil's-bit scabious and <b>Common</b> <b>Tormentil,</b> and the small copper butterfly is found there.|$|E
5000|$|Jerusalem {{artichoke}} brandy smells fruity and has {{a slight}} nutty-sweet flavour. It is characterised by an intense, pleasing, earthy note. The tubers are washed and dried in an oven before being fermented and distilled. It can be further refined to make [...] "Red Rossler" [...] by adding <b>common</b> <b>tormentil,</b> and other ingredients such as currants, to produce a somewhat bitter and astringent decoction. It is used as digestif, {{as well as a}} remedy for diarrhoea or abdominal pain.|$|E
5000|$|The {{plant is}} {{particularly}} used in herbal medicine as an astringent {{because of its}} tannin content, which is unusually high for a herbaceous plant. This is linked to its use as a red dye, {{which is due to}} the structurally similar phlobaphene content. Phlobaphenes can be extracted from the root of the <b>common</b> <b>tormentil</b> and is known as tormentil red, alongside the triterpene alcohol tormentol. The plant has extremely low toxicity, which was studied by Sergei Shushunov and his team. [...] The roots are a main ingredient of a bitter liqueur from Bavaria and the Black Forest area, called Blutwurz.|$|E
5000|$|The {{scientific}} name {{seems to have}} been influenced by a fusion of ancient names for these plants. <b>Common</b> <b>tormentil,</b> P. erecta, was known as tormentilla in medieval Latin, derived from early Spanish - literally [...] "a little torment", meaning pain that, while not debilitating, is unpleasant and persistent (such as a stomach ache, against which P. erecta was used). The change from initial [...] "t" [...] to [...] "p" [...] {{seems to have been}} influenced by terms such as poterium - Latin for the related burnets (genus Sanguisorba) - or propedila and similar words used for the European cinquefoil (P. reptans) in the now-extinct Dacian language, as attested in Latin herbals.|$|E
50|$|Since 1990 land {{improvement}} measures have been partially reversed. Wet biotopes with wet meadows and bogs have been recreated out of pasture and arable land. As a result, several threatened species {{of plant and animal}} have established themselves here. osprey, falcon, otter, great crested newt and grass snake have been seen once more. The Lewitz is a popular stopover for wild geese, crane and other migratory birds. Amongst the rare plants in the Lewitz are orchids, Pasqueflower, <b>common</b> <b>tormentil</b> and marsh gentian. The Lewitz is today both a protected area and nature reserve. Parts of the landscape were also designated as a European Bird Reserve {{at the end of the}} 20th century.|$|E
50|$|The fell is {{actively}} managed by Durham County Council, {{in an effort}} to maintain a broad range of heathland species, including such desirable species as heath bedstraw, Galium saxatile, and <b>common</b> <b>tormentil,</b> Potentilla erecta. Bracken is particularly troublesome because it crowds out the heather and associated species. The County Council has used a combination of burning and selective herbicides to control the bracken, and in 2007 embarked on a three-year trial of a more environmentally-friendly method, using heavy horses to pull a roller that crushes the bracken. These measures have not been entirely successful; areas that have been burnt are susceptible to invasion by rosebay willowherb, Epilobium angustifolium, while crushed areas have been colonised by the alien invasive heath star moss, Campylopus introflexus.|$|E
50|$|Cinquefoils are a {{prominent}} {{part of many}} ecosystems. In the United Kingdom alone, <b>common</b> <b>tormentil</b> (P. erecta) together with purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea) defines many grassy mires, and grows abundantly in the typical deciduous forest with downy birch (Betula pubescens), common wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella), and sessile oak (Quercus petraea). In upland pastures on calcareous soil it typically accompanies common bent (Agrostis capillaris), sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), and wild thyme (Thymus praecox). It is most commonly seen in regions dominated by common heather (Calluna vulgaris), including common lowland heaths with bell heather (Erica cinerea), maritime heaths with spring squill (Scilla verna), submontane heaths dominated by red peat moss (Sphagnum capillifolium) and common bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), and the mountain heathlands of Scotland with alpine juniper (Juniperus communis ssp. alpina).|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{medicinal}} plants {{is a popular}} subject that, {{at least in the}} archaeological sciences, has met a lot of criticism {{due to the lack of}} physical data. It is problematic to distinguish the medicinal plants from local flora since many herbs that were used often could be found in the nearby vegetation.   The purpose of this essay is to archaebotanically analyze samples from the medieval town Nya Lödöse and compare the data with a previous analysis from the site and a literature study. The herbs meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), lady’s mantle (Alchemilla sp.), sweet gale (Myrica gale), hop (Humulus lupulus), <b>common</b> <b>tormentil</b> (Potentilla erecta), St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum), henbane (Hyoscyamus niger), catnip (Nepeta cataria) and motherwort (Leonurus cardiaca) have been selected for closer analysis since they occur with frequency in the historical medicinal texts and in previous analysis made on the site. The aim is to investigate the similarity between the samples and what is written about the plants in the different medieval medicinal documentations. The paper will also discuss the different contemporary views on medicine and the people who practiced it, and thus extend the subject for future studies. The Nya Lödöse locale is interesting since it was active in a period of increased trade, turbulent times of political power games, witch trials and ecclesiastical power. The harbor town of Nya Lödöse has had an intense history with numerous fires and invasions. In a time of reformation, when the plague had hit Gothenburg, the witch pyres were burning and the Dane was at hand, the need for medicine must have been great.
