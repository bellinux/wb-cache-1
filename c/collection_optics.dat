50|$|A {{concentrator}} {{system has}} the advantage {{to reduce the amount}} of photovoltaic (PV) cells needed, such that somewhat more expensive and efficient multi-junction photovoltaic cells can be used that will maximize the ratio of produced high-value electrical power versus lower-value thermal power. A major limitation of high-concentrator (i.e. HCPV and HCPVT) systems is that they maintain their advantage over conventional c-Si/mc-Si collectors only in regions that remain consistently free of atmospheric aerosol contaminants (e.g. light clouds, smog, etc.). Concentrator system performance is especially degraded because 1) radiation is reflected and scattered outside of the small (often less than 1°-2°) acceptance angle of the <b>collection</b> <b>optics,</b> and 2) absorption of specific components of the solar spectrum causes one or more series junctions within the MJ cells to underperfom.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a concept for ultra-lightweight deformable mirrors {{based on a}} thin substrate of optical surface quality coated with continuous active piezopolymer layers that provide modes of actuation and shape correction. This concept eliminates any kind of stiff backing structure for the mirror surface and exploits micro-fabrication technologies to provide a tight integration of the active materials into the mirror structure, to avoid actuator print-through effects. Proof-of-concept, 10 -cm-diameter mirrors with a low areal density of about 0. 5 kg/m&# 178; have been designed, built and tested to measure their shape-correction performance and verify the models used for design. The low cost manufacturing scheme uses replication techniques, and strives for minimizing residual stresses that deviate the optical figure from the master mandrel. It does not require precision tolerancing, is lightweight, and is therefore potentially scalable to larger diameters for use in large, modular space telescopes. Other potential applications for such a laminate could include ground-based mirrors for solar energy <b>collection,</b> adaptive <b>optics</b> for atmospheric turbulence, laser communications, and other shape control applications. The immediate application for these mirrors is for the Autonomous Assembly and Reconfiguration of a Space Telescope (AAReST) mission, which is a university mission under development by Caltech, the University of Surrey, and JPL. The design concept, fabrication methodology, material behaviors and measurements, mirror modeling, mounting and control electronics design, shape control experiments, predictive performance analysis, and remaining challenges are presented herein. The experiments have validated numerical models of the mirror, and the mirror models have been used within {{a model of the}} telescope in order to predict the optical performance. A demonstration of this mirror concept, along with other new telescope technologies, is planned to take place during the AAReST mission. ...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} report for a one year close out {{extension}} of our basic research program that was established at the University of Chicago more than sixteen years ago to explore and develop the optical sub-discipline {{that has come to}} be known as ''nonimaging optics''. This program has been extremely fruitful, having both broadened the range of formalism available for workers in this field and led to the discovery of many new families of optical devices. These devices and techniques have applications wherever the efficient transport and transformation of light distributions are important, in particular in illumination, fiber <b>optics,</b> <b>collection</b> and concentration of sunlight, and the detection of faint light signals in physics and astrophysics. Over the past thirty years, Nonimaging Optics (Welford and Winston, 1989) has brought a fresh approach to the analysis of many problems in classical macro-scale optics. Through the application of phase-space concepts, statistical methods, thermodynamic arguments, etc., many previously established performance limits were able to be broken and many technical surprises with exciting practical applications were discovered. The most recent three-year phase of our long-term continuing program ended in late 2002 and emphasized extending our work in geometrical optics and expanding it to include some interesting questions in physical optics as well as in the new field of statistical optics. This report presents a survey of the basic history and concepts of nonimaging optics and reviews highlights and significant accomplishments over the past fifteen years. This is followed by a more detailed summary of recent research directions and accomplishments during the last three years. This most recent phase was marked by the broadening in scope to include a separate project involving a collaboration with an industrial partner, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). This effort was proposed and approved in 1998 and was incorporated into this project (September, 1998) with the required additional funding provided through this already existing grant...|$|R
40|$|Optical fibers allow {{a variety}} of spectroscopic sensing methods to be {{implemented}} in a single-ended backscattering geometry. Taking multimode fibers with surface-enhanced Raman scattering active tips as a model system, it is shown that the remote single-ended collection geometry can be relatively inefficient {{in comparison to the}} performance of the underlying sensor structure. Therefore the performance of the single-ended geometry has been compared to the analogous sensor structure on a nonguiding silica glass substrate. While part of the reduction in collection efficiency can be attributed to mismatches between the numerical aperture of the <b>collection</b> <b>optics</b> and that of the fiber, this study suggests that there can be an additional loss due to a mismatch between the confocal area of the <b>collection</b> <b>optics</b> and the area of the fiber core. This effect is most significant for high numerical aperture objectives. However, the collection efficiency is somewhat higher than would be expected from a simple area ratio analysis. This {{can be attributed to the}} graded-index fiber used in the model system and the relaxation of confocal requirements in the longitudinal direction...|$|E

30|$|The light <b>collection</b> <b>optics</b> should {{maximize}} {{the number of}} photons captured from the photon stream directed towards the satellite by the OGS. Ideally, the OGS produces a diffraction limited beam diameter of a little over 1 meter {{at the location of}} the satellite for the 808  nm quantum channel; in practice increased to several meters due to atmospheric turbulence. Increasing the receptor aperture will directly result in higher signal. Losses internal to the quantum channel light <b>collection</b> <b>optics</b> and the polarization analysis module should also be minimized. The receiver telescope must preserve the polarization direction of the incoming photons, such that it contributes not more than 0.25 % to the total polarization error (see Sect.  4.2). This signifies that the receiver telescope is polarization neutral {{to the extent that the}} spread in polarization of beams taking different paths through the telescope will be less than 1 ∘. Starting point for the optical design is a Cassegrain telescope with an opening aperture of 150  mm diameter and an overall length of just 125  mm. A refractive solution was not considered. Although the weight of a lens system could be reduced using a Fresnel lens, strong accelerations along the optical axis expected during launch are a serious concern, as is radiation damage of the optics.|$|E

A collimation system is proposed and optimized for the case of a shielded target with quarter-wave transformation <b>collection</b> <b>optics</b> so that the power loss in the magnets and RF structures is effectively controlled within the acceptable level and in the damping ring (DR) within 640 W, assuming 3 × 10 10 of the captured positrons per bunch in the DR. In this case, the capture efficiency and DR injection efficiency are 13 % and 99. 8 %, respectively. The lower capture efficiency is expected to result in higher injection efficiency and therefore, a lower power loss in the DR. The capture efficiency for the cases of a shielded target with flux concentrator and 5 -T immersed target with flux concentrator is 20 % and 30 %, respectively, with the collimation system. * Work supported by DOE contract DE-AC 02 - 76 SF 0051...|$|E
