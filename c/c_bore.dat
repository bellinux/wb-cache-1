50|$|Accordingly, {{a pair of}} {{prototype}} aircraft, {{known as}} the VJ 101 C, were developed; these were powered by the lighter RB145 turbojet engine, which was mounted in swivelling nacelles instead. However, development of the VJ 101 C would not be straightforward; one major complication was the changing requirements of the BMVg, who decided to switch the aircraft's envisioned mission profile from the interceptor role to a more general fighter instead, which imposed a requirement {{for it to be}} capable of longer low altitude flight endurance, amongst other performance attributes. The new proposal had merged the characteristics of earlier Bölkow, Heinkel and Messerschmitt designs into a sleek, streamlined platform. The VJ 101 <b>C</b> <b>bore</b> some similarities in appearance to the American Bell XF-109, both aircraft having a comparable configuration in terms of possessing paired engines fitted within swivelling nacelles which were positioned at their wingtips.

40|$|Micro bore {{finishing}} for {{metal and}} ceramic materials {{has been a}} challenge in the manufacturing industry. Unfortunately, little is understood about how to polish a micro bore and how to assess its inner wall quality because {{it is difficult to}} access the micro bore for either polishing or measurement. This article reports on a feasibility study of the abrasive flow polishing of micro bores of 260 similar to 500 -mum diameters and 25 similar to 50 length/diameter ratios for both metal and ceramic materials. An abrasive flow polishing machine was designed and built with turbulent flow characteristics. Polishing of steel S 45 <b>C</b> <b>bores</b> of 400 - and 500 -mum diameters, stainless steel 304 bores of 500 -mum diameter, and zirconia bores of 260 -mum diameter was conducted. Surface roughness and topography of the polished inner walls of micro bores were characterized using profilometry and optical interferometry from the three-dimensional point of view. Significant reduction in surface roughness of the micro bore inner walls has been made in the polishing processes. The results indicate that it is feasible to apply the abrasive flow polishing technology for metal and ceramic micro bores of diameters of 260 mum or larger and the length/diameter ratios of 25 or higher. It is found that surface roughness of the polished micro bore inner walls decreases with an increase of the abrasive flow passes...|$|R

These host-plant and herbivore associations are mediated by seven functional feeding groups: a) external foliage feeding, b) piercing-and-sucking, <b>c)</b> <b>boring</b> (Phase 1 origins); d) galling, e) seed predation, f) nonfeeding oviposition (Phase 2 origins); and leaf mining (early Phase 3 origin).

40|$|The {{comeback}} of the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) throughout {{western and}} central Europe {{is considered a}} major conservation success. Traditionally, several subspecies are recognised by morphology and mitochondrial haplotype, each linked to a relict population. During various reintroduction programs in the 20 th century, beavers from multiple source localities were released and now form viable populations. These programs differed in their reintroduction strategies, i. e., using pure subspecies vs. mixed source populations. This inhomogeneity in management actions generated ongoing debates regarding the origin of present beaver populations and appropriate management plans for the future. By sequencing of the mitochondrial control region and microsatellite genotyping of 235 beaver individuals from five selected regions in Germany, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Belgium we show that beavers from at least four source origins currently form admixed, genetically diverse populations that spread across the study region. While regional occurrences of invasive North American beavers (n = 20) were found, all but one <b>C.</b> fiber <b>bore</b> the mitochondrial haplotype of the autochthonous western Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU).

50|$|The {{following}} {{description of}} the construction and acoustic properties of the sordoni will clear up the mystery. The body consisted of a cylinder of wood in which were cut two parallel channels of narrow cylindrical bore, communicating with {{each other at the}} bottom through a bend, but not with ambient air. At the top of the cylinder was fitted a double-reed mouthpiece giving access to the column of air {{at one end of the}} bore, while the other was vented through a small hole in the side, similar to the finger-holes; in the tenor, bass and contra members of the family, the reed was attached to a curved brass crook similar to that of the fagotto. So far the description would almost apply to the dolcian also, but in the latter there is the radical difference that the bore of the channels is conical, so that it has the acoustic properties of the open pipe. The sordun, however, having a cylindrical bore, has the acoustic properties of the stopped pipe, i.e. the sound waves are twice the length of the pipe, so that to produce a sound of any given pitch, for instance for <b>C,</b> the <b>bore</b> need only be half the length, i.e. 4 ft. long. Overblowing, on the sordoni, moreover, produced as first harmonic (the only one required for reed-blown instruments in order to produce the diatonic scale for the second octave) not the octave, but the twelfth, or number 3 of the series. This accounts for the fact that instruments of the fagotto and dolcian type require but six or seven holes to give the diatonic scale throughout the compass, whereas the sordoni require 11 or 12 holes. Praetorius states that those figured by him have 12 open holes, and that some specimens have in addition two keys; a hole is also bored through the bottom of the instrument to allow the moisture condensed from the breath to be shaken out. The 12 holes are stopped by means of fingers and thumbs and by the ball of the hand or the fleshy underpart of the joints of the fingers.|$|R
