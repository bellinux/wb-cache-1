It also introduces wire-irregularity detection methods for catenary estimation, and discusses modern spectrum estimation tools for catenary. It is organized in three parts: the first discusses statistical characteristics of pantograph-catenary data, such as stationarity, periodicity, correlation, high-order statistical properties and wave characteristics of contact lines, {{which are the}} basis of pantograph-catenary relationship analysis. The second part includes geometry parameter detection and support-system fault detection in catenary, as well as slide-fault detection in pantographs, and presents some new detection algorithms and plans. The final part addresses catenary estimation, including detection of contact-line wire irregularities and estimation of catenary based on spectrum, and presents detection methods for contact-line irregularity and modern spectrum estimation tools for catenary...|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{this study}} is to propose and develop a cost {{effective}} production design concept suitable for oil reservoirs situated in deep (1500 m) water which can be quickly and safely installed in areas with limited weather windows. The proposed design is based upon a steel catenary riser which will connect an FPSO directly into either a wellhead or seabed pipeline system thereby eliminating both the connection complexes and high cost associated with a central manifold. The <b>catenary</b> <b>geometry</b> will ensure that the structure is inherently compliant whilst a carrier pipe arrangement will provide structural protection and buoyancy to a flowline bundle contained within. The interface between the riser and the surface production vessel is a critical part of any riser system and so for the purposes of this study two design arrangements are considered. The first is based upon a direct connection between an FPSO turret and riser whereas the second is a hybrid design in which the riser is supported by a sub-surface buoy which is hydraulically connected to an FPSO using flexible flowlines. This hybrid connection has the advantage of decoupling FPSO and riser motions. Design development is carried out by examining a range of critical areas...|$|E

Mittels globaler Sensitivitätsstudien in der p-FEM-Software Creo Simulate wird mithilfe eines in Creo Parametric parametrisierten CAD-Modells der Kettenlinie in Parameterdarstellung ein normiertes Kerbzahldiagramm erstellt. Dieses erlaubt die Dimensionierung einer Kerbe, d. h. die Festlegung ihrer exakten Geometrie und der damit verbundenen Kerbzahl αk ohne die weitere Verwendung eines FEM-Programmes.

40|$|This design-research thesis - The 4 -Dimensional Masonry Construction - {{presents}} {{innovation in}} the design and construction of thin-shell tile vaulted structures. The core research contributions of this thesis are: # 1 Testing limit states of unit hinging + displacement in single-layer tile vaults. # 2 Introducing modified masonry units to achieve directional surfaces with high degrees of double-curvature and porosity. The 4 -Dimensional Masonry Construction operates as a heuristic device to conceptualize, visualize and represent the way in which a masonry unit hinges in space within a complex, doubly-curved structural surface. By modifying masonry units, the resulting system of aggregation can produce asymmetrical and disaggregating tile coursing geometries - predictable yet geometrically incomprehensible systems. By establishing reciprocity between the modified unit/ system relation and the method of vault assembly, new forms in structural masonry are possible. Such structural forms are a product of these unique unit/ system geometries, the constraint of structural <b>geometries</b> (<b>catenary</b> systems and double curvature for lateral stiffness), the techniques of graphical analysis to define such a structure spatially, and the logic of sequencing to maintain the units' systematic relation, to constrain units inherently given to push the limits of constructibility. by Lara K.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} number of risers attached to floating oil and gas production platforms, it is necessary to include the influence of risers in the motion analysis of the platform in waves. The motion analysis is required to determine the workability of the unit and the loads on the structure, therefore accurate results are of great importance. Deep-water semi submersibles with over fifty risers are being built, but still the risers are often extremely simplified in the motion analysis. This report describes the development and evaluation of a method to include the effects of steel catenary risers on the first order wave response of a semi submersible in frequency domain motion analysis. In this method the riser system is replaced by a damped mass - spring system. The method is applied on a semi submersible and the results are compared with results from the simplified method currently used by Marine Structure Consultants b. v. (MSC) and an advanced coupled method. Lumped mass simulations show that risers can be modelled as a damped mass - spring system. The damping is quadratically related to velocity, but can be linearized into fi-equency dependent linear damping. The effective mass of the riser can be considered constant over the frequency range of first order motions. The simulations reveal that risers approximately maintain their quasi-static <b>catenary</b> <b>geometry</b> during wave frequency heave motions, which is not the case during horizontal motions. Systematic lumped mass simulations with various riser types and configurations show clear relations between the riser parameters and the damping and mass coefficients as long as the riser motion is rather quasi-static, but these relations get disturbed when the riser deviates too much from its catenary shape. An empirical model is derived which can be used to find the coefficients of the damped mass - spring system for risers within the range of tested riser configurations. The current MSC frequency domain motion analysis includes the stiffness of the mooring and riser system and uses empirical riser mass terms based on the static vertical tension. The new frequency domain method improves this with mass and damping terms based on lumped mass riser excitation simulations. A linearized frequency dependent damping term is used, because quadratic damping cannot be included properly in the motion analysis software. The original and new methods are verified with a time domain motion analysis where the lumped mass model of the risers is coupled to the hydrodynamic model of the hull. This is the most accurate method available for this analysis. Both the original and the new method perform well in the horizontal plane. For vertical motions however, the current MSC method performs insufficiently; the new method performs much better, although there are still deviations from the coupled analysis. The main conclusion is that the new method significantiy improves the prediction of vertical first order motions. Other conclusions are that risers can have an important effect on the first order motions of a semi submersible and that risers can be modelled as damped mass - spring systems. The coefficients of these systems can be obtained using empirical equations with variables like water depth, diameter, frequency and amplitude, as long as these variables are within the range of tested risers. If they are not, lumped mass simulations should be used to obtain the coefficients. It is recommended to use either the new method or a fully coupled method. When the damping and mass coefficients can be obtained from the empirical formulas, the new method is very fast compared to coupled analysis. Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
