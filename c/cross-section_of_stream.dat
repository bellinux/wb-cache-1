The problem is researched {{as the one that}} consists of the independent problems of the flow’s calculation in the separated <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stream</b> filament. These independent problems can be solved either one after another or simultaneously.

40|$|Third-order {{analytical}} expressions {{are obtained}} for the lift and wave-drag coefficients of a two-dimensional wing. The expressions are used to demonstrate the possibility of boomless lifting configuration designs when the <b>cross-section</b> area <b>of</b> the <b>stream</b> tube is reduced. The reduction is obtained by processing the captured airstream {{in such a manner}} that the stream tube area is smaller at the exit than at the entrance. Calculations by these expressions are shown to be in good agreement with exact results obtained from compressive flow tables. It is also shown that three-dimensional wing configurations of this design give the maximum thermodynamic effect when a propulsive power plant is employed for the reduction of the captured-stream area. Thermodynamic guidelines are given for power plant designs to be used for this purpose...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{comparative}} study {{of the use of}} palaeohydrological and hydrological techniques to estimate magnitude and frequency of floods applied to two high-gradient, small catchments located in the Spanish Central Pyrenees: the Arás basin, 18. 6 km 2, and the Montardit basin, 15. 2 km 2. Palaeohydrological (palaeoflood) techniques, based on palaeostage indicators and the application of both Manning’s equation and critical flow equation, were used to estimate discharge values corresponding to seven <b>cross-sections</b> <b>of</b> the Montardit <b>stream.</b> This method yielded discharges ranging from 7 to 112 m 3 sec- 1. Palaeoflood and historical flood analyses indicated a greater frequency of high magnitude events for both the Arás and Montardit basins than suggested by the application of two different methodologies based on precipitation data (the rational and the unit hydrograph methods). The 1996 Arás basin flood was modelled using the unit hydrograph method, with most reliable results (217 m 3 sec- 1) obtained using a semidistributed basin model. For small, ungauged mountain basins, palaeoflood reconstruction provides an excellent tool to obtain past flood discharges on which to base the calibration of parameters (e. g. runoff threshold) used in rainfall-runoff methods. It is proposed that the combined results of long-term flood record analysis (based on palaeoflood and historical data) and of standard hydrometeorological methods will aid in the assessment of flood risks for application to the design of emergency measures and floodplain management in ungauged mountain streams...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by a {{question}} of Hirzebruch on the possible topological types <b>of</b> cusp <b>cross-sections</b> <b>of</b> Hilbert modular varieties, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a manifold M to be diffeomorphic to a cusp <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> a Hilbert modular variety. Specialized to Hilbert modular surfaces, this proves that every Sol 3 –manifold is diffeo morphic to a cusp <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> a (generalized) Hilbert modular surface. We also deduce an obstruction to geometric bounding in this setting. Consequently, there exist Sol 3 –manifolds that cannot arise as a cusp <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> a 1 –cusped nonsingular Hilbert modular surface. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{analogy with}} the <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> a solid, the <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> an -dimensional body in an -dimensional space is the {{non-empty}} {{intersection of the}} body with a hyperplane (an -dimensional subspace). This concept has sometimes been used to help visualize aspects of higher dimensional spaces. For instance, if a four-dimensional object passed through our three-dimensional space, we would see a three-dimensional <b>cross-section</b> <b>of</b> the four-dimensional object. In particular, a 4-ball (hypersphere) passing through 3-space would appear as a 3-ball that increased to a maximum and then decreased in size during the transition. This dynamic object (from {{the point of view}} of 3-space) is a sequence <b>of</b> <b>cross-sections</b> <b>of</b> the 4-ball.|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: River {{regulation}} works, channelization and floodplain urbanization {{have reduced}} the frequency of flooding, incised river channels, and separated them from the surrounding riparian zones. This phenomenon is especially unfavourable for exposed riverine sediment areas (ERS) situated in the transition zone between terrestrial and aquatic environments, and plays {{a fundamental role in}} the functioning of riverine ecosystems. We investigated the effects of restoration practise based on eco-friendly structures on riparian ground beetle communities. Materials and methods: Carabids were surveyed in 60 sampling sites of incised and redeposited <b>cross-sections</b> <b>of</b> a mountain <b>stream.</b> At each cross-section geodetic measurements were surveyed and six sampling sites were randomly established at different distances from the water surface. Results and conclusions: Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed that the dissimilarity in carabid communities between the three benches resulted mainly from differences in hydrological (bankfull discharge, period of flooding, water velocity) and geomorphological parameters (incision and erosion) in the incised and redeposited cross-sections. A GLM indicated that incision-redeposition processes had a significant effect on carabid assemblage parameters and life history traits. The effect of redeposition processes on abundance, species richness, biomass and MIB depended strongly on bench height and flood frequency. The cross-sections where eco-friendly constructions were built and bed material deposition processes were recreated showed increased abundance of ERS specialists: small predators with high dispersal power and a spring breeding strategy. However, the proportion of specialist species in the community was small, which indicates a slow rate of restoration of ERS specialist diversity...|$|R
