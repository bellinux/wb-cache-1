Turmeric has a brilliant yellow color, which indicates that it has the power of curing the jaundice; for the same reason, poppies must relieve diseases of the head; Agaricus those of the bladder; Cassia fistula the affections of the intestines, and Aristolochia the disorders of the uterus: the polished surface and stony hardness which so eminently characterize the seeds of the Lithospermum officinale (<b>common</b> <b>gromwell)</b> were deemed a certain indication of their efficacy in calculous and gravelly disorders; for a similar reason, the roots of the Saxifraga granulata (white saxifrage) gained reputation in the cure of the same disease; and the Euphrasia (eye-bright) acquired fame, as an application in complaints of the eye, because it exhibits a black spot in its corolla resembling the pupil. The blood-stone, the Heliotropium of the ancients, from the occasional small specks or points of a blood-red color exhibited on its green surface, is even at this very day employed in many parts of England and Scotland to stop a bleeding from the nose; and nettle tea continues a popular remedy for the cure of Urticaria. It is also asserted that some substances bear the signatures of the humors, as the petals of the red rose that of the blood, and the roots of rhubarb and the flowers of saffron that of the bile.” ...|$|E

50|$|Lithospermum latifolium is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the borage family known by the <b>common</b> names American <b>gromwell</b> and American stoneseed. Its native range is centered in the Midwestern United States, where it is found in calcareous forests. It is a hairy, tall perennial herb that produces small yellow flowers in late spring.|$|R
40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>gromwell</b> (Lithospermum officinale) {{acts as a}} {{host plant}} for the {{monophagous}} moth Ethmia dodecea  whose larvae are completely dependent on the leaves. As conservation authorities now want to reinstate the regionally extinct moth to Mälardalen, a stable population of its host plant is a requirement. To facilitate the work of strengthening the presence of gromwell a partnership was therefore initiated between Västmanland County Board and Uppsala University. In this cooperation, I performed two studies. In the first one I examined how water and temperature affect plant germination and how nutrient levels affect early growth. In the second study I investigated whether the germination is influenced by chemical treatment (soaking in acid) and mechanical damage (seeds scratched with sandpaper) on the seeds. I worked with the hypothesis that gromwell is grazed by cows and is therefore dispersed and germinates in the spring. This should mean high water levels combined with high temperatures would produce higher germination. For the second study, {{it means that the}} germination rate should be higher in the seeds treated with the acid than in the scratched and control treatments. In the first study, so few seeds germinated that I could not draw any conclusions, but germinations appear to go faster in the combination with high nutrients high temperature and frequent watering. In the second study, the seeds scraped with sandpaper had the highest germination rate. This indicates that gromwell may be dispersed by birds, and I propose sandpaper rubbing as a method to easily increase the germination rates of L. officinale in greenhouses in order to reinforce small populations in the field. ...|$|E
