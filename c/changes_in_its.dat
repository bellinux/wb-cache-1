5|$|Like the {{majority}} of known extrasolar planets, 47 Ursae Majoris c was discovered by detecting <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> star's radial velocity caused by the planet's gravity. This was done by measuring the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{majority}} of known extrasolar planets, 55 Cancri c was detected by observing <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> star's radial velocity. This was achieved by making sensitive measurements of the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum. At the time of discovery, 55 Cancri A was already known to possess one planet (55 Cancri b); however, {{there was still a}} drift in the radial velocity measurements which was unaccounted for.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{majority}} of known extrasolar planets, Taphao Thong was discovered by detecting the <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> star's radial velocity as the planet's gravity pulls the star around. This was achieved by observing the Doppler shift of the spectrum of Chalawan. After {{the discovery of the}} first extrasolar planet around a Sun-like star, Dimidium, astronomers Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler searched through their observational data for signs of extrasolar planets and soon discovered two: Taphao Thong and 70 Virginis b. The discovery of Taphao Thong was announced in 1996.|$|E

5|$|Named Alchiba, Alpha Corvi is a white-hued star of {{spectral}} type F1V {{and magnitude}} 4.0, 48.7 ± 0.1 light-years from Earth. It exhibits periodic <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> spectrum over a three-day period, which suggests {{it is either}} a spectroscopic binary or (more likely) a pulsating Gamma Doradus-type variable. If the latter is the case, it {{is estimated to be}} 1.39 times as massive as the Sun. According to Bayer's atlas, it lies above the bird's beak.|$|E

5|$|As the environments of most {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} changing, {{the reactions of}} metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the regulation of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway). For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if these changes have {{little effect on the}} flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway.|$|E

5|$|Diamond Rio is an American {{country and}} Christian country music band. The band {{was founded in}} 1982 as an {{attraction}} for the Opryland USA theme park in Nashville, Tennessee, and was originally known as the Grizzly River Boys, then the Tennessee River Boys. It was founded by Matt Davenport, Danny Gregg, and Ty Herndon, the last of whom became a solo artist in the mid-1990s. After undergoing several membership <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> initial years, the band has consisted of the same six members since 1989: Marty Roe (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Gene Johnson (mandolin, guitar, fiddle, tenor vocals), Jimmy Olander (lead guitar, Dobro, banjo), Brian Prout (drums), Dan Truman (keyboards, organ, synthesizer), and Dana Williams (bass guitar, baritone vocals).|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 d was {{discovered}} by analysing <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> star's radial velocity {{as a result of}} the planet's gravity. The radial velocity measurements were made by observing the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. At the time of discovery, Gliese 876 was known to host two extrasolar planets, designated Gliese 876 b and c, in a 2:1 orbital resonance. After the two planets were taken into account, the radial velocity still showed another period, at around two days. The planet, designated Gliese 876 d, was announced on June 13, 2005 by a team led by Eugenio Rivera and was estimated to have a mass approximately 7.5 times that of Earth.|$|E
5|$|The dipole is tilted roughly 10° from Jupiter's axis of rotation; {{the tilt}} {{is similar to}} that of the Earth (11.3°). Its {{equatorial}} field strength is about 776.6μT (7.766G), which corresponds to a dipole magnetic moment of about 2.83 T·m3. This makes Jupiter's magnetic field about 20 times stronger than Earth's, and its magnetic moment ~20,000times larger. Jupiter's magnetic field rotates at the same speed as the region below its atmosphere, with a period of 9h55m. No <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> strength or structure have been observed since the first measurements were taken by the Pioneer spacecraft in the mid-1970s.|$|E

5|$|From the {{earliest}} times, the Chinese {{were concerned with}} the destructive force of earthquakes. It was recorded in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian of 91BC that in 780BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers. It was not known {{at the time that}} earthquakes were caused by the shifting of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou Dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic yin and yang, along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty. These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the Yijing (Book of <b>Changes),</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> fifty-first hexagram. There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the ancient Greeks. Anaxagoras (c.500–428BC) believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface crust of the earth bursting into the Earth's hollows; Democritus (c. 460–370BC) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them; Anaximenes (c.585–c.525BC) believed they were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the cavernous hollows due to drying; and Aristotle (384–322BC) believed they were caused by instability of vapor (pneuma) caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.|$|E
