In 1869, the company's annual report said, [...] "During {{the last ten}} years little or nothing had been done toward repairing and improving lock-houses, <b>culverts,</b> <b>aqueducts,</b> locks, lock-gates and waste weirs of the Company; many of them had become entirely unfit for use and were becoming worthless, rendering it absolutely essential to the requirements of the Company to have them repaired." [...] Still, some improvements were made in the late 1860s, such as replacing Dams No. 4 and 5.|$|R
5|$|The Mycenaean Greeks {{were also}} pioneers {{in the field}} of engineering, {{launching}} large-scale projects unmatched in Europe until the Roman period, such as fortifications, bridges, <b>culverts,</b> <b>aqueducts,</b> dams and roads suitable for wheeled traffic. They also made several architectural innovations, such as the relieving triangle. They were also responsible for transmitting a wide range of arts and crafts, especially of Minoan origin. The Mycenaean civilization was in general more advanced compared to the Late Bronze Age cultures of the rest of Europe. Several Mycenaean attributes and achievements were borrowed or held in high regard in later periods; so, it would be no exaggeration to consider Mycenaean Greece as a cradle of civilization.|$|R

25|$|He {{also built}} many masonry {{structures}} {{to isolate the}} many rivers that flow into the canal and spillways to regulate the water level. He built 49 <b>culverts</b> and <b>aqueducts,</b> including the Cesse aqueduct, the Orbiel aqueduct and the Pechlaurier culvert. Finally, he reinforced a lot of works and dams originally built by Riquet. This series of works, which lasted until 1694, greatly improved the supply and management of water. Antoine Niquet was responsible for monitoring the canal until 1726.|$|R
50|$|Ancient Roman {{builders}} {{made use}} of concrete and soon poured the material into moulds to build their complex network of <b>aqueducts,</b> <b>culverts,</b> and tunnels. Modern uses for pre-cast technology include a variety of architectural and structural applications — including individual parts, or even entire building systems.|$|R
5000|$|The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C&O) used 11 navigable aqueducts {{to carry}} the canal over rivers and streams that were too wide for a <b>culvert</b> to contain. <b>Aqueducts,</b> like locks and other masonry structures, were called [...] "works of art" [...] by the canal board of directors.|$|R
50|$|Salt, coal, pork products, {{wool and}} lumber were shipped out, and {{furniture}} and iron products were brought into Athens and Hocking counties via the canal. It had 26 locks, 7 <b>culverts,</b> and an <b>aqueduct</b> crossing Monday Creek south of Nelsonville. Operation {{of the canal}} never proved profitable, least of all the 15-mile stretch between Nelsonville and Athens, where a number of salt works were located. Their owners, frustrated by {{the slow pace of}} the canal boats (4 miles per hour) and the unavailability of the canal in the winter when it often froze, began construction of the Columbus and Hocking Valley Railroad, which by 1857 competed with the canal for cargo.|$|R

The fall from Stoneywood to the low water mark at Aberdeen was 168 ft. As originally built, it was about 17 ft wide and 3 ft deep. John Rennie suggested it should be 27 ft wide and 4 ft deep, and although it was enlarged in the first six years, it was only increased to 23 ft wide and 3 ft deep.|$|R
