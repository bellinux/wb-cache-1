40|$|Introduction  The {{cigarette}} stick is {{an important}} communications tool {{as well as the}} object of consumption. We explored young adults’ responses to cigarettes designed to be dissuasive.   Methods  Data come from a cross-sectional online survey, conducted in September 2015, with 16 - 24 year old smokers and non-smokers (N= 997) in the United Kingdom. Participants were shown images of a standard cigarette (white cigarette paper with imitation cork filter), a standard cigarette displaying the warning ‘Smoking kills’ on the cigarette paper, and an unattractively coloured cigarette (green <b>cigarette</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> <b>filter).</b> They were asked to rate each of the three cigarettes, shown individually, on eight perception items, and to rate the three cigarettes, shown together, on how likely they would be to try them. Ordering of the cigarettes and questions, {{with the exception of the}} question on trial, was randomised.   Results  The eight perceptions items were combined to form a composite measure of cigarette perceptions. For smokers and non-smokers, the two dissuasive cigarettes (cigarette with warning, green cigarette) were rated significantly less favourably than the standard cigarette, and less likely to encourage trial. For cigarette perceptions no significant interaction was detected between cigarette style and smoking status or susceptibility to smoke among never smokers. A significant interaction was found for likelihood of trying the cigarettes, with dissuasive cigarettes having a greater impact with smokers than non-smokers.   Conclusions  This study suggests that dissuasive cigarettes may help to reduce the desirability of cigarettes.   Implications The cigarette stick is the object of tobacco consumption, which is seen every time a cigarette is smoked. It is also an increasingly important promotional tool for tobacco companies. In this study, young adults rated two dissuasive cigarettes (a green coloured cigarette and a cigarette displaying a health warning) more negatively than a standard cigarette, and considered them less likely to encourage product trial. Our findings suggest that it may be possible to reduce the desirability of cigarette sticks by altering their design, e. g. with the addition of a warning or use of an unattractive colour...|$|E

40|$|This study investigates by {{nonlinear}} constitutive equations {{the influence}} of tipping <b>paper,</b> <b>cigarette</b> <b>paper,</b> <b>filter,</b> <b>and</b> tobacco rod {{on the degree of}} <b>filter</b> ventilation <b>and</b> draw resistance. Starting from the laws of conservation, the path to the theory of fluid dynamics in porous media and Darcy's law is reviewed and, as an extension to Darcy's law, two different nonlinear pressure drop-flow relations are proposed. It is proven that these relations are valid constitutive equations and the partial differential equations for the stationary flow in an unlit cigarette covering anisotropic, inhomogeneous and nonlinear behaviour are derived. From these equations a system of ordinary differential equations for the one-dimensional flow in the cigarette is derived by averaging pressure and velocity over the cross section of the cigarette. By further integration, the concept of an electrical analog is reached and discussed in the light of nonlinear pressure drop-flow relations. By numerical calculations based on the system of ordinary differential equations, it is shown that {{the influence of}} nonlinearities cannot be neglected because variations in the degree of filter ventilation can reach up to 20 % of its nominal value...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{mechanism}} for the generation of cigarette smoke, the combustion mechanism of a burning cigarette during a puff was investigated by focusing on air transfer. In particular, the air flow distribution outside a burning cigarette was observed and related to the aerodynamic effects of the <b>cigarette</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> the puffing rate. The air flow rate was measured by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), using olive oil droplets as the tracer particles. It was found that air does not flow into {{the tip of the}} burning cigarette and that the air flow was concentrated at the region - 2 to 2 mm around the <b>cigarette</b> <b>paper</b> char-line. This behavior was independent of the <b>cigarette</b> <b>paper</b> basis weight. When the puffing rate was changed from 2. 5 to 35 mL/s, the air flow was concentrated at a region close to the <b>cigarette</b> <b>paper</b> char-line <b>and</b> the maximum velocity around the <b>cigarette</b> <b>paper</b> char-line increased with the puffing rate...|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for a}} smoldering cigarette has been proposed. In {{the analysis of the}} cigarette combustion and pyrolysis processes, a receding burning front is defined, which has a constant temperature (~ 450 °C) and divides the cigarette into two zones, the burning zone and the pyrolysis zone. The char combustion processes in the burning zone and the pyrolysis of virgin tobacco and evaporation of water in the pyrolysis zone are included in the model. The hot gases flow from the burning zone, are assumed to go out as sidestream smoke during smoldering. The internal heat transport is characterized by effective thermal conductivities in each zone. Thermal conduction of <b>cigarette</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> convective and radiative heat transfer at the outer surface were also considered. The governing partial differential equations were solved using an integral method. Model predictions of smoldering speed as well as temperature and density profiles in the pyrolysis zone for different kinds of cigarettes were found to agree with the experimental data. The model also predicts the coal length and the maximum coal temperatures during smoldering conditions. The model provides a relatively fast and efficient way to simulate the cigarette burning processes. It offers a practical tool for exploring important parameters for cigarette smoldering processes, such as tobacco components, properties of <b>cigarette</b> <b>paper,</b> <b>and</b> heat generation in the burning zone and its dependence on the mass burn rate...|$|R

30|$|The {{importance}} of oxygen diffusion into the burning zone and in controlling steady-state smouldering {{of cellulosic materials}} is well known (Moussa et al. 1977). The mechanism of oxygen diffusion through a solid membrane with a microscopic structure (e.g., a <b>cigarette</b> <b>paper)</b> differs from the mechanism of air flow due to a pressure difference (Baker and Crellin 1977). The former {{is driven by the}} oxygen concentration gradient and tortuosity of the microscopic pores within the structure, whereas the latter is controlled by forced air flow (pressure difference) and dominated by the presence of large pores or holes. These two properties coexist in RIP <b>cigarette</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> in combination control both the mainstream smoke yields during puffing and reduced ignition propensity during the RIP test (Norman 1999; Norman et al. 2005).|$|R
