40|$|Background—Driving a taxicab {{remains one}} of the most {{dangerous}} occupations in the United States, with leading homicide rates. Although safety equipment designed to reduce robberies exists, it is not clear what effect it has on reducing taxicab driver homicides. Findings—Taxicab driver homicide crime reports for 1996 through 2010 were collected from 20 of the largest cities (> 200, 000) in the United States: 7 <b>cities</b> <b>with</b> cameras installed in cabs, 6 <b>cities</b> <b>with</b> partitions installed, and 7 <b>cities</b> <b>with</b> neither cameras nor partitions. Poisson regression modeling using generalized estimating equations provided city taxicab driver homicide rates while accounting for serial correlation and clustering of data within cities. Two separate models were constructed to compare (1) <b>cities</b> <b>with</b> cameras installed in taxicabs versus <b>cities</b> <b>with</b> neither cameras nor partitions and (2) <b>cities</b> <b>with</b> partitions installed in taxicabs versus <b>cities</b> <b>with</b> neither cameras nor partitions. <b>Cities</b> <b>with</b> cameras installed in cabs experienced a significant reduction in homicides after cameras were installed (adjRR = 0. 11, CL 0. 06 - 0. 24) and compared to <b>cities</b> <b>with</b> neither cameras nor partitions (adjRR = 0. 32, CL 0. 15 - 0. 67). <b>Cities</b> <b>with</b> partitions installed in taxicabs experienced a reduction in homicides (adjRR = 0. 78, CL 0. 41 - 1. 47) compared to <b>cities</b> <b>with</b> neither cameras nor partitions, but it was not statistically significant. Conclusions—The findings suggest cameras installed in taxicabs are highly effective in reducing homicides among taxicab drivers. Although not statistically significant, the findings suggest partitions installed in taxicabs may be effective.
