5|$|The Fox River at Silver Springs has {{numerous}} {{species of}} freshwater fish including, bluegill, crappie, <b>channel</b> <b>catfish,</b> bullhead, carp, muskie and northern pike. The Loon and Beaver Lake fish population is maintained through human stocking. <b>Channel</b> <b>catfish,</b> bass, bluegill and crappie are stocked in both lakes.|$|E
5|$|Several {{locations}} {{are available for}} fishing. According to Texas Parks and Wildlife, the following fish have {{been caught in the}} stream: largemouth bass, bluegill, <b>channel</b> <b>catfish,</b> Rio Grande cichlid, longnose gar, green sunfish, sunfish hybrid, redbreast sunfish, and redear sunfish.|$|E
5|$|Aside from carp, {{several species}} of fish and {{amphibians}} still inhabited the creek up to the 1980s, when floods destroyed much of the remaining riparian habitat. These included the mosquito fish, bluegill, bass, and <b>channel</b> <b>catfish,</b> as well as {{several species of}} native frogs. After the floods, most of these species were reported to have disappeared completely.|$|E
30|$|<b>Channel</b> <b>catfish’s</b> viscera was {{obtained}} from a local market in Selangor/Malaysia, and was washed and weighed (749  g) before mixing with 1  M phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) in the blender with a ratio of 2 : 1 buffer-to-viscera, then sample was filtered using a muslin cloth.|$|R
50|$|Herb Parsons Lake {{has several}} species of fish {{including}} largemouth bass, bluegill, crappie, redear sunfish, and blue, <b>channel</b> & bullhead <b>catfish.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are fishing {{opportunities}} along the river, especially for <b>channel</b> and flathead <b>catfish.</b> Minneopa Creek below the falls also supports game fish.|$|R
5|$|Stocking of {{the lake}} with fish began before the {{reservoir}} was filled, with a small rearing pond being placed {{on the bottom of}} the valley. The lake has several species of freshwater fish; largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, bluegill, crappie, rainbow trout, striped bass, <b>channel</b> <b>catfish,</b> and shad. It is considered one of the best fisheries in California.|$|E
5|$|S. iniae {{is highly}} {{pathogenic}} in freshwater, marine, and euryhaline fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks {{may be associated}} with 30–50% mortality. It is, therefore, one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture. In 1997, the global economic impact of S.iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US$100million (one-tenth of which in the United States). As of 2007, infection had been reported in 27 species of fish, including tilapia (genus Oreochromis and Tilapia), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and barramundi (Lates calcarifer, which can be an asymptomatic carrier). Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), <b>channel</b> <b>catfish</b> (Ictalurus punctatus), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) appear to be resistant. Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. suboptimal temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to S.iniae infection. Wild fish populations located both near and far from aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to S.iniae infection.|$|E
5|$|The {{banks of}} Pine Creek and Spring Creek {{are lined with}} large rock and cliff {{formations}} that provide habitat to plants ranging from large trees to moss to hanging vines. The cliffs harbor plants rare {{in the state of}} Illinois such as Canada yew and sullivantia (family Saxifragaceae), an Illinois state-threatened species. When in season, the park's many species of wildflowers bloom, some of the flowers found in the park include: trout lily, Solomon's seal, bloodroot, blue-eyed grass, spring beauty, and hepatica. The forest undergrowth provides small mammal habitat and among the mammals that {{can be seen in the}} park are: red squirrels, raccoons, deer, and chipmunks. Birds include, the pine thrush, warblers, wild turkey, and winter-migratory birds. The creeks are populated with smallmouth bass, rock bass, <b>channel</b> <b>catfish</b> and, when they are stocked by the IDNR, rainbow trout.|$|E
40|$|Hemiancistrus pankimpuju, new species, and Panaque bathyphilus, new species, are {{described}} {{from the main}} channel of the upper (Maranon) and middle (Solimoes) Amazon River, respectively. Both species are diagnosed by having a nearly white body, long filamentous extensions of both simple caudal-fin rays, small eyes, absence of an iris operculum and unique combinations of morphometrics. The coloration and morphology of these species, unique within Loricariidae, are hypothesized to be apomorphies associated with life in the dark, turbid depths of the Amazon mainstem. Extreme elongation of the caudal filaments in these {{and a variety of}} other main <b>channel</b> <b>catfishes</b> is hypothesized to have a mechanosensory function associated with predator detection.

5|$|The first fish {{descriptions}} from Puerto Rico {{were compiled}} by Cuvier and Valenciennes in 1828. They reported 33 taxa for the archipelago. Puerto Rico has few native freshwater fish species; however, {{there are over}} 30 introduced species, mainly originating from Africa, South America and the southeastern United States, have established populations, and 60 marine species use Puerto Rico's freshwater bodies intermittently during the year. Introductions have been intentional and accidental. The purposes of intentional introductions have been sport fishing for recreation and food, mosquito control, and to provide baitfish for largemouth bass. Accidental introductions, such as the sailfin armored catfish (Pterygoplichthys multiradiatus), are mainly attributed {{to the release of}} aquarium fish. Since 1936, the Puerto Rican Department of Natural and Environmental Resources runs a hatchery at the municipality of Maricao. About 25,000 fish, including largemouth bass, peacock bass, and <b>channel</b> <b>catfish,</b> and some turtle species are raised annually to stock Puerto Rico's reservoirs and rivers.|$|E

25|$|Crayfish are {{commonly}} sold {{and used as}} bait, either live or with only the tail meat, and are good at attracting <b>channel</b> <b>catfish,</b> walleye, trout, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, pike and muskellunge. Sometimes the claws are removed so that the crayfish do not stop fish from biting the hook. Crayfish easily fall off the hook, so casting should be slow.|$|E
