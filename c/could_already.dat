5|$|In Aristotle's time, the 4th century BCE, {{porpoises}} {{were regarded}} as fish due to their superficial similarity. Aristotle, however, <b>could</b> <b>already</b> see many physiological and anatomical similarities with the terrestrial vertebrates, such as blood (circulation), lungs, uterus and fin anatomy. His detailed descriptions were assimilated by the Romans, but mixed with a more accurate knowledge of the dolphins, as mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his “Natural history”. In the art of this and subsequent periods, porpoises are portrayed with a long snout (typical of dolphins) and a high-arched head. The harbour porpoise {{was one of the}} most accessible species for early cetologists, because it could be seen very close to land, inhabiting shallow coastal areas of Europe. Much of the findings that apply to all cetaceans were first discovered in porpoises. One of the first anatomical descriptions of the airways of the whales on the basis of a harbor porpoise dates from 1671 by John Ray. It nevertheless referred to the porpoise as a fish.|$|E
25|$|Catt had a {{sense of}} urgency, expecting a {{slowdown}} in reform energy after the war, which had ended seven months earlier. Many local suffrage societies had disbanded in states where women <b>could</b> <b>already</b> vote, making it more difficult to organize a quick ratification.|$|E
25|$|The next change came at ECTS 2001, {{when the}} {{interface}} became almost {{what it is}} today.

40|$|We solve Conway’s Angel Problem {{by showing}} that the Angel of power 2 has a winning strategy. An old {{observation}} of Conway is that we may suppose {{without loss of generality}} that the Angel never jumps to a square where he <b>could</b> have <b>already</b> landed at a previous time. We turn this observation around and prove that we may suppose without loss of generality that the Devil never eats a square where the Angel <b>could</b> have <b>already</b> jumped. Then we give a simple winning strategy for the Angel. ...|$|R

50|$|This massive {{accumulation}} of data implies that almost any useful program one <b>could</b> want <b>already</b> {{exists in the}} Qeng Ho fleet library, hence the need for computer archaeologists to dig up needed programs, work around their peculiarities and bugs, and assemble them into useful constructs.|$|R
25|$|County cricket clubs <b>could</b> <b>already</b> employ {{any number}} of EU {{residents}} under the Bosman ruling. There were no other Test cricket nations within the EU, however, which explains why it was Kolpak, not Bosman, which has had the significant impact on English county cricket. The largest group of countries with an association agreement with the EU is the ACP Group of States, which includes South Africa, Zimbabwe, {{and many of the}} nations that supply the West Indies cricket team.|$|E
25|$|Up to 60% of the Republic of Ireland {{could receive}} UK {{channels}} via spillover or via cable. Cable {{in the republic}} was only permitted in areas of spillover up to the mid-1980s, to provide viewers with better reception of channels they <b>could</b> <b>already</b> receive over the air. Hence RTÉ 2 was aimed at those {{that did not have}} the UK channels. To this end one of their main remits was the re-broadcasting of UK programming to Irish audiences, that would not otherwise be seen on RTÉ 1.|$|E
25|$|Xun Xu's father, Xun Xi (荀肸), died early, so Xun Xu {{was raised}} by Zhong Yao and his family, who were distantly related to him through his {{maternal}} uncle. Zhong Yao served as the Grand Tutor (太傅) in the imperial court {{of the state of}} Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period {{after the end of the}} Eastern Han dynasty. As a child, Xun Xu was a fast learner and <b>could</b> <b>already</b> write essays when he was only 10. Zhong Yao once remarked that Xun Xu would grow up to become like his great-grandfather.|$|E

25|$|Direct {{distance}} dialing, {{which allowed}} callers to reach other users outside their local calling area without operator assistance, {{was introduced to}} the public in Englewood. On November 10, 1951, Englewood Mayor M. Leslie Denning made the first customer-dialed long distance call, to Mayor Frank Osborne of Alameda, California. As of that date, customers of the ENglewood 3, ENglewood 4 and TEaneck 7 exchanges, who <b>could</b> <b>already</b> dial some exchanges in the New York City area, were able to dial 11 cities across the United States by dialing the three-digit area code preceding the local number.|$|E
25|$|For {{his horse}} riding role as Jim Ryan in the {{production}} of The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular, Martin Crewes, who <b>could</b> <b>already</b> ride, was given intensive riding lessons by expert riding teacher Steve Jefferys, so that Crewes would not require a body double for the difficult riding feats he had to accomplish in the show. Jefferys also taught Crewes the difficult art of being a horse whisperer for his role as Jim Ryan. Horse whispering usually takes years to learn, but Crewes was able to master this difficult skill in only two weeks.|$|E
25|$|William of Ockham (1285–1350), Doctor Invincibilis, was an English Franciscan friar, philosopher, logician and theologian. Ockham {{defended the}} {{principle}} of parsimony, which <b>could</b> <b>already</b> {{be seen in the}} works of his mentor Duns Scotus. His principle later became known as Occam's Razor and states that if there are various equally valid explanations for a fact, then the simplest one should be chosen. This became a foundation of what would {{come to be known as}} the scientific method and one of the pillars of reductionism in science. Ockham probably died of the Black Plague. Jean Buridan and Nicole Oresme were his followers.|$|E

25|$|Through productivity-enhancing {{investments}} in fixed capital, {{the use of}} a large amount of energy (heat energy from peat as an industrial fuel, wind power) per worker, and a substantial investment in human capital (as witnessed by the high literacy rate), the Dutch managed to raise labor productivity above the levels prevailing in other European countries. This is illustrated by {{the fact that in the}} mid-17th century the agricultural sector, employing less than 40 percent of the labor force, <b>could</b> <b>already</b> almost be a net food exporter (which it became by 1800), and the fact that nominal wages between 1600 and 1800 were the highest in Europe. In the open economy of the Republic such a wage gap could only be sustained by enduring productivity differences.|$|E
25|$|One {{study found}} that juggling novices showed a {{bilateral}} gray matter expansion in the medial temporal visual area (also known as V5) over a three-month period during which they had learned to sustain a three-ball cascade {{for at least a}} minute. No changes were observed in a control group that did not engage in juggling. The extent of these changes in the jugglers reduced during a subsequent three-month period in which they did not practice juggling. To further resolve the time course of these changes, the experiment was repeated with another young cohort scanned in shorter intervals, and the by then typical changes in V5 <b>could</b> <b>already</b> be found after just seven days of juggling practice. Interestingly, the observed changes were larger in the initial learning phase than during continued training.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the cover}} of night, the French mounted sorties with object of {{destroying}} the siege trenches. Mélac personally led several of these attacks. A French engineer officer named Rovère disguised himself and got within the Imperial lines, but he was found and captured on 8 July. The second parallel was opened on 21 June and the third parallel on 16 July. Mélac flooded the moat on 26 July. The three parallels were completed on 2 August and interconnected. By this date, {{the damage to the}} fortress walls <b>could</b> <b>already</b> be seen. Meanwhile, the besiegers overran the outworks one by one. In this situation, the French increasingly relied on buried mines within threatened outworks. When the Imperials stormed such a position, before retreating, the French would light the fuse and hope that many attackers would be blown up in the ensuing explosion. To prevent these losses, the Imperial engineers dug countermines.|$|E

25|$|During initial episodes from Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, {{director}} Mitsuo Fukuda did {{not want}} to talk too much about Shinn's character. However, he defined him as Kira's opposite in regards to their personalities when comparing the two lead characters. Shinn is defined as a civilian whose character <b>could</b> <b>already</b> go through a large development in contrast to Kira who was forced to become a soldier in the prequel Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. In comparison with Kira, Shinn was stated to be character harder to predict his role in the TV series. As with Kira in Gundam SEED, Fukuda mentioned Shinn's character would also change across the series. Kenichi Suzumura was especially hired to work as Shinn's Japanese voice actor with Fukuda stating he was not a character difficult to play. Fukuda also anticipated Suzumura's work as Shinn's voice actor in an optimistic way. Before the series' premiere, staff member Kabashima Yousuke gave hints about Shinn's character, telling that the Gundam SEED Destinys protagonist would be a character not seen in the prequel, and he would have a thin appearance.|$|E

25|$|Near {{the south}} exit {{close to the}} main bar, {{opposite}} end of the building from the Cabaret Room, a wedding reception drew to a close around 8:30p.m. in the Zebra Room, near the building's main entrance; some of its guests had complained of the room being excessively warm with loud explosions from beneath the floor, and the group left the building before the end of their allotted time. The room remained vacant from their departure until a minute before 9 p.m., when an employee smelled smoke and opened the Zebra Room's door to confirm the presence of smoke. She asked another employee to call the Fire Department while she and others grabbed any available fire extinguishers and began trying to fight the flames. Though the employees were not aware of it, their opening of the Zebra Room's door allowed enough oxygen into the room to cause what had been a smoldering fire in the room's drop ceiling to flashover and begin to spread rapidly. It quickly became clear that fire extinguishers could not suppress the fast-growing fire. The Fire Department was alerted to the fire at 9:01p.m. and was on the scene by 9:05; as they approached, firefighters on the first emergency vehicles <b>could</b> <b>already</b> see smoke coming from the building.|$|E

500|$|The {{quest for}} 'genetic perfection' is a pseudo-religious concept to Zerg that drives {{them on a}} steady state of {{evolution}} and conflict; the zerg believed there was a state that the zerg could reach where they no longer needed to evolve, that their evolutionary form {{would never have to}} change again because they <b>could</b> <b>already</b> adapt to any situation.
