5|$|The 5th National Congress again {{amended the}} party constitution, adding {{a chapter on}} control <b>commissions</b> <b>and</b> their aims but devoting little {{attention}} to their operations. Partly because of this, the control commissions actively participated in several party rectification campaigns during the late 1920s and early 1930s. At that time the commissions tended to participate in political struggles, most notably the purges of Zhang Guotao and Wang Ming.|$|E

5|$|In 1336 John married Maud de Badlesmere, who was {{the second}} of the four daughters of Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere, of Badlesmere in Kent and Margaret de Clare. Maud was a {{co-heiress}} of her brother Giles de Badlesmere, 2nd Baron Badlesmere. When Giles died in 1338, this brought {{a significant part of the}} Badlesmere inheritance into de Vere's hands. The marriage also forged a strong bond with William Bohun, Earl of Northampton, who had married Badlesmere's third daughter, Elizabeth de Badlesmere, and thus became Oxford's brother-in-law. The two campaigned together, sat on the same <b>commissions</b> <b>and</b> died the same year.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} Mercator on the cartographic scene {{would have been}} noted by the cognoscenti who {{purchased}} Gemma's globe—the professors, rich merchants, prelates, aristocrats and courtiers of the emperor Charles V at nearby Brussels. The <b>commissions</b> <b>and</b> patronage of such wealthy individuals would provide {{an important source of}} income throughout his life.

5|$|The {{pursuit of}} full {{dominion}} status was then regarded {{as something of}} a non-issue by most Southern Rhodesian politicians. They viewed themselves as virtually independent already; they lacked only the foreign affairs portfolio and taking this on would mean having to shoulder the expense for high <b>commissions</b> <b>and</b> embassies overseas. Huggins and the United Party instead pursued an initially semi-independent Federation with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, two protectorates directly administered from London, with the hope of ultimately creating a single, united dominion in south-central Africa.|$|E

During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major <b>commissions</b> <b>and</b> produced his best-known paintings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the past}} few decades, {{the legacy of the}} League of Nations started to be {{reviewed}} by historians as the League Archives at Geneva were better explored, and the United Nations faced similar troubles to those of the interwar period. The current consensus state that, even though the League failed to achieve its ultimate goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the rule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of collective security, giving a voice to smaller nations; helped to raise awareness to problems like epidemics, slavery, child labor, colonial tyranny, refugee crisis and general working conditions through its numerous <b>commissions</b> <b>and</b> committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the mandate system put the colonial powers under international observation.|$|E
5|$|Jones' top {{priority}} as governor was {{the passage of}} health care reform. He appointed two health care reform study <b>commissions,</b> <b>and</b> in May 1993, he called the legislature into a special session to consider a universal health care bill. The only measure {{to come out of}} this session was a temporary tax on health care providers. Legislators also agreed to work toward a bill that could be passed in the next regular legislative session. On March 2, 1994, the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill that did not include universal coverage. Angered, Jones began campaigning against the bill, but the Kentucky Senate passed its version on March 22.|$|E
