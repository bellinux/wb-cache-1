40|$|AbstractTransmitter release at most central synapses {{depends on}} {{multiple}} types of calcium <b>channels.</b> <b>Identification</b> of the <b>channels</b> mediating GABA release in hippocampus {{is complicated by}} the heterogeneity of interneurons. Unitary IPSPs were recorded from pairs of inhibitory and pyramidal cells in hippocampal slice cultures. The N-type channel antagonist ω-conotoxin MVIIA abolished IPSPs generated by interneurons in st. radiatum, whereas the P/Q-type antagonist ω-agatoxin IVA had no effect. In contrast, ω-agatoxin IVA abolished IPSPs generated by st. lucidum and st. oriens interneurons, but ω-conotoxin MVIIA had no effect. After unitary IPSPs were blocked by toxin, transmission could not be restored by increasing presynaptic calcium entry. The axons of the two types of interneurons terminated within distinct strata of area CA 3. Thus, GABA release onto pyramidal cells, unlike glutamate release, is mediated entirely by either N- or P-type calcium channels, depending on the presynaptic cell and the postsynaptic location of the synapse...|$|R

Another application to move the existing analog signal to channel 45 was dismissed in 2004 at the station's request. More recently, WSHM had a construction permit to air a low-powered digital signal on UHF channel 21. On November 22, 2010, this became active after WSHM finally gained a [...] "license to cover" [...] allowing it to turn-off its analog signal (on channel 67) and activate its own digital signal for the first time. Prior to this transition, WSHM was carried through a standard definition simulcast on WFSB's second digital subchannel.

50|$|The {{graphics}} of the re-launch {{were different}} from those of the last look in many ways. The BBC News 24 <b>channel</b> <b>identification</b> was moved from the upper left corner of the screen to become part of the Aston; the News 24 has been brought down below the BBC logo and is contained along with the clock in a red box with the red and black globe visible in the background. The remainder of the aston featured a red heading with black information box with white text with no specific colour used for breaking news. For live broadcasts, a red box containing 'LIVE' was added to the top left corner of the screen, usually with the location written to the right in a black box. Originally no ticker, a device used to scroll news and information across the bottom of the screen, was used consistently on the channel, however one was adopted c.2004. This ticker ran from below the clock across to the right of the screen; the topic of the ticker was shown in a black box below the clock with the news rolling by in black on a white background separated by the BBC logo.|$|E

Despite this, broadcasters persist with the practice. In response to negative feedback, the BBC has responded, [...] "We believe it is important to ensure that viewers can quickly identify when they are watching a BBC service." [...] It reinforced this position in both 2008 and 2009 following continual complaints to its Points of View programme, citing <b>channel</b> <b>identification</b> as the sole reason for the policy. In its website FAQs, Five's stated reason for its use of a DOG is that [...] "the vast majority of channels carry them, most permanently and virtually every channel at some point has one during the day." [...] However, on 21 October 2008, the BBC announced that it was removing the DOG from BBC HD for all films and most dramas, acknowledging that there was an [...] "irritation factor". However, the DOG came back when BBC One HD launched in 2010. As of 2016, neither BBC One HD nor BBC Two HD was using a DOG. More recent additions are graphics which appear near the end of a programme to tell the viewer what's up next, despite this information being available at a touch of a button on digital TV. Many viewers also find this practice annoying, distracting and unnecessary.|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the thesis, blind and semi-blind <b>channel</b> <b>identification</b> are studied for 3 G W-CDMA {{communications}} by using receive diversity where one transmit antenna and two receive antennas are employed. A blind <b>channel</b> <b>identification</b> scheme is proposed by applying the Cross-Relation Method to a derived SIMO channel model. This blind scheme is then augmented to a semi-blind one by using the known pilot symbols as constraints. In the second part of the thesis, semi-blind <b>channel</b> <b>identification</b> by employing transmit diversity is researched where two transmit antennas and one receive antenna are used. First, the orthogonal transmit diversity scheme by pre-coding information symbols is studied. Secondly, the orthogonal transmit diversity scheme based on multiple code transmission is considered. Thirdly, the transmit diversity scheme called delay transmit diversity is investigated. Semi-blind <b>channel</b> <b>identification</b> algorithms are derived by applying the Cross-Relation Method together with pilot symbols to these diversity schemes. In the third part of the thesis, semi-blind <b>channel</b> <b>identification</b> through employing delay spread diversity is considered where a single transmit antenna and a single receive antenna are used. A semi-blind <b>channel</b> <b>identification</b> method is developed by applying both the Cross-Relation Method and pilot symbols. To evaluate the proposed blind and semi-blind <b>channel</b> <b>identification</b> algorithms, a space-time Rake receiver is simulated where the blind and semi-blind channel estimates are used in coherent demodulation. ...|$|E

40|$|Estimating time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) {{remains a}} {{challenging}} task when acoustic environments are reverberant and noisy. Blind <b>channel</b> <b>identification</b> approaches for TDOA estimation explicitly model multipath reflections {{and have been}} demonstrated {{to be effective in}} dealing with reverberation. Unfortunately, existing blind <b>channel</b> <b>identification</b> algorithms are sensitive to ambient noise. This paper shows how to resolve the noise sensitivity issue by exploiting prior knowledge about an acoustic room impulse response (RIR), namely, an acoustic RIR can be modeled by a sparse-nonnegative FIR filter. This paper shows how to formulate a single-input two-output blind <b>channel</b> <b>identification</b> into a least square convex optimization, and how to incorporate the sparsity and nonnegativity priors so that the resulting optimization remains convex and can be solved efficiently. The proposed blind sparse-nonnegative (BSN) <b>channel</b> <b>identification</b> approach for TDOA estimation is not only robust to reverberation, but also robust to ambient noise, as demonstrated by simulations and experiments in real acoustic environments. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Blind <b>channel</b> <b>identification</b> has {{generated}} {{much interest in}} signal processing and communications. Although ex-isting cross relation based blind <b>channel</b> <b>identification</b> algorithm can achieve promising results, one of the drawbacks is the performance degradation in a noisy environment. In this work, we show that the degradation in convergence performance of MCLMS is due to an implicit constraint imposed by the cross relation cost function. This constraint requires the estimated impulse responses {{to be of the}} same energy which is often untrue in practice. We next propose a new algorithm exploiting revised cost function to improve the robustness of MCLMS to noise. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can gain significant improvement in steady-state performance.
