5000|$|Making {{the journey}} to CCIDD {{requires}} not only the proper emotional state, but also the proper intentions. In an open letter concerning the value of service, Rachel Naomi Remen reminds us all to reevaluate our personal positions {{with respect to the}} dichotomy that inevitably exists between the notions of service and help. In effect, service can only be performed in [...] "a relationship between equals" [...] while help is based on a relationship of inequality, especially since it assumes that one side of the relationship is [...] "stronger" [...] than the other. CCIDD therefore does not wish for its students to [...] "help" [...] the local Mexican population; let the tourists do that, it wants its students to [...] "serve" [...] the people. This service can either be direct or indirect. Direct service involves projects like painting schools, composting trash, and building houses. Indirect service includes initiating <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>dialogues,</b> visiting local archaeological sites, and reflecting upon the daily experiences that one undergoes.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis lavishly {{illustrated}} {{volume is}} the first major global history of ornament from the Middle Ages to today. Crossing historical and geographical boundaries in unprecedented ways and considering the role of ornament in both art and architecture, Histories of Ornament offers a nuanced examination that integrates medieval, Renaissance, baroque, and modern Euroamerican traditions with their Islamic, Indian, Chinese, and Mesoamerican counterparts. At a time when ornament has re-emerged in architectural practice and is a topic of growing interest to art and architectural historians, the book reveals how {{the long history of}} ornament illuminates its global resurgence today. Organized by thematic sections on the significance, influence, and role of ornament, the book addresses ornament's current revival in architecture, its historiography and theories, its transcontinental mobility in medieval and early modern Europe and the Middle East, and its place in the context of industrialization and modernism. Throughout, Histories of Ornament emphasizes the portability and politics of ornament, figuration versus abstraction, <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>dialogues,</b> and the constant negotiation of local and global traditions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports the}} {{transformation}} of the bases of the “linguistic personality” theoretical model as a result of changes in socio-pedagogical and professional context of society. The preconditions under discussion brought about the necessity of working out didactic principles for higher institutions, which largely contribute to the formation of a new type of the educational model – that of “professional linguistic personality”, based on competency. Overview of interdisciplinary research shows incipient humanistic tendencies emerging in the system of Russia's education, which call forth both anthropic and technological insight into the principles of foreign language teaching. One of the main characteristics of developing language intelligence is the emphasis on mental performance – training learners to become operationally effective by means of programmed learning and self-education. However uncovering individual meanings is impossible without feedback, based on Internet <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>dialogues.</b> The results of the study have led us to the formulation of a set of principles and requirements which provide for maturing new skills to be invested directly in the productive force of a University graduate.

40|$|This {{collaborative}} thesis {{focuses on}} the extensive collection of works on paper and related objects by Ford Madox Brown (1821 - 1893) held at Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery (BMAG). It is the first academic study to use Brown's works on paper {{as the basis for}} discussion. In doing so it seeks to throw light on neglected areas of his work and to highlight the potential of prints and drawings as subjects for scholarly research. The thesis comprises a complete catalogue of the works on paper by Brown held at BMAG and three discursive chapters exploring the strengths of the collection. Chapter one {{focuses on the}} significant number of literary and religious works Brown made in Paris between 1841 and 1844 and examines his position in the <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>dialogues</b> taking place in Europe in the mid-nineteenth century. Chapter two uses the dual definition of the word 'construction' to examine how his interpretation of history was affected by contemporary changes in historiography, and to discuss his practical approach to composing a history painting. Chapter 3 studies illustrations he made for publication. Progressing chronologically, it explores his changing attitude towards illustration as a medium and argues that these works had increasing importance for his artistic career. The catalogue is the most up-to-date and informative inventory of the collection and includes new identifications, titles and dates and exegeses.

His film Shooting Indians: A Journey with Jeffery Thomas is the first Canadian documentary that engages with aboriginal issues from South Asian (indeed any other than Anglo or French) perspective. Still used in a range of university courses the film was instrumental in generating Define Indian a series of inter-communal dialogues between South Asian and Aboriginal artists across Canada created by SAVAC. In 2009 curator Srimoyee Mitra used the film as starting point for a multidisciplinary show Crossing Lines: Intercultural Dialogues, that brought together South Asian and Six Nations artists. Shooting Indians was as an installation. In her article in Cultivating Canada; Reconciliation Through the Lens of Cultural Diversity, Mitra writes [...] "Shooting Indians: A Journey with Jeff Thomas helped me understand the strategy of developing <b>cross-cultural</b> <b>dialogues</b> as a process of building trust and mutual respect. It formed the touchstone for this exhibition. As a next-generation immigrant and cultural practitioner, I felt {{that it was important to}} highlight and revisit the discussion started by the duo in this exhibition. In fact, the dialogic approach developed by the artists through the development of the film also formed one of the core principles of Thomas’s photographic practice." [...] Kazimi gave the plastic cowboy and Indian figurines he used in the opening of the film to photographer Jeff Thomas. Thomas has cited this as leading to his most successful photographic series in which he used the figurines juxtaposed against monuments all over the world.|$|R
