50|$|Halsey {{also argued}} that he had feared leaving TF 34 to defend the strait without <b>carrier</b> <b>support</b> as that would have left it {{vulnerable}} to attack from land-based aircraft, while leaving one of the fast carrier groups behind to cover the battleships would have significantly reduced the concentration of air power going north to strike Ozawa.|$|E
