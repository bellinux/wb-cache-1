40|$|Originally, the Lomé {{convention}} {{aimed to}} be the framework for genuine development cooperation between the Old Continent and its former colonies. It was an instrument which, without being a cure for all ills, provided substantial guarantees for countries that had been exhausted by years of economic, political and cultural domination by Europe. However, from the 80 's onwards, the demands made by neo-liberalism and the priority given to the market economy overrode the research effort and support deployed in favour of autonomous and balanced development of countries which nevertheless make up {{a majority of the}} so-called "lesser developed countries" (LDC's). The fishery Accords in particular, despite the financial compensation they bring with them and the additional aid for training and research, do not contribute to any real development of ACP countries' fisheries. There is a simple reason for this: they are commercial, rather than development agreements. They are a god-send for the industrial fleets of the European Community which, thanks to the Accords, are granted the enormous advantage of being able to exploit for their own profit waters which are rich in both fish and shell-fish of high commercial value. Without these Accords, the fishing fleets of the rich countries of Europe would be forcibly laid up and their crews dismissed on account of the over-fishing in Northern waters. Moreover, the aid for research and training is largely piecemeal and the stipulations of the Accords are by no means obeyed as they should be. For example, very few fishermen from ACP countries have found a berth on board European <b>Community</b> <b>vessels</b> for training purposes, as the Lome Convention gives them the right to expect. The new Lome Accords signed in 1990 give {{no reason to believe that}} the EC is moving towards a more committed policy of development cooperation. The economic demands of the 1993 Single Market, the channelling of aid towards the new democracies in the East, the search for more lucrative markets with more credit-worthy partners [...] . are all ominous portents for the world's poorest countries. After being the most colonial of continents in the history of mankind, can it be that present-day Europe, or what will very soon become of it with the probable integration of certain countries from the East, is once again going to miss one of the great opportunities of History? As the third millenium dawns, Europe is being given a great chance : to make a full assessment of the poor countries' demo-graphic importance in the very near future, and to reply generously to their most basic needs. From this point of view, the development of small-scale fisheries in Third World countries is a vital issue. Will Europe meet this challenge?

40|$|Abstract The {{bacterium}} Xylella fastidiosa is {{the causal}} agent of citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) {{and has been}} associated with important losses in commercial orchards of all sweet orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) ] cultivars. The development of this disease depends on the environmental conditions, including the endophytic microbial community associated with the host plant. Previous studies have shown that X. fastidiosa interacts with the endophytic <b>community</b> in xylem <b>vessels</b> {{as well as in the}} insect vector, resulting in a lower bacterial population and reduced CVC symptoms. The citrus endophytic bacterium Methylobacterium mesophilicum can trigger X. fastidiosa response in vitro, which results in reduced growth and induction of genes associated with energy production, stress, transport, and motility, indicating that X. fastidiosa has an adaptive response to M. mesophilicum. Although this response may result in reduced CVC symptoms, the colonization rate of the endophytic bacteria should be considered in studies that intend to use this endophyte to suppress CVC disease. Symbiotic control is a new strategy that uses symbiotic endophytes as biological control agents to antagonize or displace pathogens. Candidate endophytes for symbiotic control of CVC must occupy the xylem of host plants and attach to the precibarium of sharpshooter insects to access the pathogen. In the present review, we focus on interactions between endophytic bacteria from sweet orange plants and X. fastidiosa, especially those that may be candidates for control of CVC...|$|R

Recently, the emergence of sites along an interstice between these two manifestations has invited study {{of the potential for}} socio-material syncretization within such a ‘borderland’ context.

Furthermore, in Chapter Two, this study adopts the coupling of materiality theory and the communities of practice approach, along with an attribute-based analysis of pottery form and decoration in discussing communities of practice and notions of identity at Location 3, a thirteenth century ‘borderland’ site near Arkona, Ontario.

40|$|Membraniporosis tubigera (Osburn 1940) (Fig. 1 a–f) was {{collected}} in 2008 in São Paulo and between August and september 2009 in Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil in shrimp trawlnets or by hand in sand beaches. This species was originally {{described as being}} from Puerto Rico and the Gulf of Mexico (Florida and Texas), and since then {{it has been reported}} forming erect colonies in the Pacific (Japan, Australia, and New Zealand), south-southeastern Brazil, and Uruguay (Gordon et al. 2006; López Gappa et al. 2010). Encrusting colonies of M. tubigera were found on floating plastics, dead leaves, and algae with other pseudoplanktonic bryozoans [eg. Jellyella tuberculata (Bosc, 1802) (Taylor and Monks 1997) ]. Erect fronds were found stranding in sandy beaches. We have found young encrusting colonies of M. tubigera, which are considered rare (Gordon et al. 2006). They are small, flat, rounded, forming unilaminar patches (Fig. 1 a) entirely covering the substrata in late astogeny (Fig. 1 b–d) and often covering both surfaces of algae with bilaminar expansions at the edge (Fig. 1 e). Erect fronds previously reported from New Zealand and Brazil may have a tapering proximal portion that could facilitate the detachment of fronds from the encrusting colony (Gordon et al. 2006). Erect colonies of M. tubigera may also become free with the restruction of ephemeral substrata (Fig. 1 f). The dispersal mechanisms of M. tubigera are poorly understood. The occurrence of living M. tubigera on floating plastics and algae with other pseudoplanktonic bryozoan species provides evidence for rafting as a dispersal mechanism, and the characteristic shape of foliaceous colonies, which keep alive when free, could also benefit dispersal. Dispersal by rafting does not exclude the hypothesis of transoceanic transportation in fouling <b>communities</b> of <b>vessels</b> or ballast water, as suggested by Gordon et al. (2006). Although it is unclear where M. tubigera is originally native, it has been considered invasive in many places. Given the variety of possible dispersal capabilities, it is expected that M. tubigera may reach new localities in tropical to warm-temperate waters of the Atlantic, Indo-Pacific, and eastern Pacific over relatively short time periods.

40|$|Bioreduction {{is a novel}} {{method for}} the on-farm storage of fallen stock in a vessel {{containing}} water that is heated and aerated, prior to disposal. The combination of a mesophilic temperature and high bacterial population leads to rapid degradation of carcasses due to microbial and enzymatic breakdown of protein material; and ultimately the reduction in volume of waste to be disposed. The system could, however, be improved if more was known about the changes that occur during a bioreduction cycle. Pig carcasses were placed within two commercial-scale bioreduction vessels (BVs) (6. 5 m 3 capacity) and the changes in physicochemical parameters, enzymatic activity, gas emissions and microbial communities were analysed over 56 days. Analyses showed that each vessel displayed different physicochemical parameters. The microbial <b>communities</b> within both <b>vessels</b> were also distinct, though they converged between days 28 and 42 before again diverging. Of the enzymes assayed, acetylesterases showed the highest activity during initial stages, with a subsequent increase in lipase towards the end. All other enzymes showed little activity in comparison. Despite active aeration of the vessels, conditions were redox-constrained, leading to the emission of gases associated with anaerobic conditions, namely NH 3 and H 2 S. It was concluded that no single parameter governed the biochemical processes and that each BV will have its own unique microbial population and hence rate of decomposition. Further work is needed to increase the rate of bioreduction through bioaugmentation or developing enzyme additives...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} novelty detection {{techniques that}} {{use a combination}} of Gaussian processes, extreme value theory and divergence measurement to identify anomalous behaviour in both streaming and batch marine data. The work is set in context by a review of current methodologies, identifying the limitations of current modelling processes within this domain. Marine data modelling is first improved by endowing the Gaussian process with the capacity to model both first order and second order dynamics; enhancing maritime data modelling through exploration of appropriate Gaussian process kernels. Gaussian processes are then used to forecast probable future vessel positions. The concept of combining the predictive uncertainty from the Gaussian process with extreme value distributions is then introduced. This provides a means of detecting anomalous vessel dynamics given the previously learnt model. The process is made amenable to online operation through adaption of the Gaussian process to sequential updates. The latter allows the model to be updated in an efficient online manner, after confirming that received data lies within the probability bounds of the model forecast behaviour. Finally a means of measuring distance between functions is introduced, which is used to identify <b>communities</b> of similar <b>vessel</b> types based on the underlying vessel dynamics. This is used {{to address the issue of}} vessel class (i. e. fishing vessel, cargo vessel etc.) misrepresentation through detection of anomalies between the inferred vessel class and the class broadcast by the vessel.

The problem was expected to get worse after the Russo-Japanese War ended and Japan turned its resources back to peacetime uses because Japan was not a signatory to any sealing treaties. During the summer of 1908, Bertholf and his crew were kept very busy; they confiscated two Japanese ships caught sealing within the three-mile limit, and had to transport the ships and crews to Unalaska and testify in federal court. After the trial, Bear was tasked with hauling the prisoners to jail in Valdez, Alaska and didn't make a return to its homeport in Sausalito, California until late November. Other assignments during the three-year tour of duty that Bertholf commanded Bear included hydrographic surveys, shipwreck rescues and transporting 143 destitute men and women from Nome to Seattle.

40|$|In {{this study}} I {{investigated}} Procellariiformes (albatrosses, petrels and shearwaters) at sea {{in the southwestern}} Atlantic Ocean. Fourteen species and 301 individuals were sampled non-destructively using a cast net method described here. A method is described for ageing Atlantic Yellow-nosed (Thalassarche chlororhynchos) and Black-browed (T. melanophris) Albatrosses based on bill colour and moult. Procellariiformes appear to have two distinct moulting strategies: petrels and shearwaters have complete annual moult, start to moult during the breeding period, and replace several primaries and tail feathers at one time, whereas albatrosses undergo long moulting cycles, replace less feathers at once, and suspend the wing moult during breeding periods. Primary moult starting at P 2 rather than P 1 was demonstrated to be a common feature in this taxon, with important implications for studies of stable isotopes, trace elements and pollutants in feathers. Overlap between moulting and breeding is demonstrated to be common with tail and contour feathers, but limited in wing, which suggests that flight constraint in long distance foragers rather than nutritional and energetic limitations is the ultimate factor determining primary moult timing. Based on molecular sexing and linear measurements, sexual size dimorphism was shown to vary according to species, with females in general smaller than males, more pronounced in bill measurements than in other traits, and more conspicuous in Giant Petrels (Macronectes spp.) and Diomedea albatrosses. Closely related species pairs of Thallassarche albatrosses and Procellaria petrels had differing levels of sexual dimorphism. The pelagic seabird community sampled comprises birds from different ages and breeding status according to species. Skewed Adult Sex Ratio (ASR) has been proposed as a common pattern in birds, frequently biased towards males and with larger biases in globally threatened species. In albatrosses and petrels, differential mortality of one gender in fisheries is suggested {{to be caused by}} sexual size dimorphism giving males a competitive advantage, which allows more access of the larger sex to discards and baits, or to at sea segregation of sexes. These hypotheses were tested by sampling birds at sea and reviewing ASR of birds incidentally captured in fisheries. Skewed ASR is common in albatrosses and petrels from the <b>community</b> attending <b>vessels,</b> but there was no correlation between skewed ASR and conservation status, both in terms of population size or global level of threat, or between ASR and sexual size dimorphism. Thus, sexual dimorphism in size does not explain skewed ASR in the community sampled or in incidental captures in fisheries reported in the review. Differential at sea distributions of males and females appear to explain better the patterns found in the community sampled at sea, as well as skewed ASR in seabird fatalities. Kernel density analysis of satellite tracked Spectacled Petrels (Procellaria conspicillata) in 2006 and 2007 demonstrated intense use of waters in the Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone, from 26 to 31 S, mainly over the continental shelf break and offshore waters. The marine habitats used by Spectacled Petrel and described by bathymetry, SST and productivity are remarkably {{different from those of the}} sister species White-chinned Petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis), which occurs in the area during the winter, but remains over the continental shelf, on Sub-Antarctic and oligotrophic waters. A close association between birds and pelagic longline fishery was demonstrated through comparison of the main kernel areas used by Spectacled Petrels and the pelagic longline fleet. Stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ 15 N) and carbon (δ 13 C) in blood preserved in different ways and simultaneously growing feathers were analysed in Spectacled Petrel. Mean δ 13 C and δ 15 N values in growing feathers were higher than in blood, suggesting tissue-specific fractionation. Different methods of preserving tissues such as blood may bias stable isotope values. Air drying is proposed as a practical and unbiased method for blood preservation in field situations where freezing is not a practical option, and a mathematical approach is suggested to permit comparison between studies using different preservation methods or tissues. By analysing stable isotopes in blood of all species of Procellariiformes sampled it is demonstrated that availability of discard, mainly the preferred shark liver, which is shared among species with contrasting body masses and feeding techniques, is the ultimate cause of overlapping in trophic levels. Carbon isotopic signature overlapped among the species and was typical of subtropical and offshore region. Early migrant individuals from Antarctica and sub-Antarctic (e. g. Cape Petrel Daption capense, White-chinned Petrel, Wilson’s Storm-petrel Oceanites oceanicus) and species still rearing chicks when sampled (Wandering Albatross Diomedea exulans) had clear carbon isotopic signatures from the austral region. All southern latitude species underwent a clear shift in carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures, increasing in trophic level after arriving in the SW Atlantic. Cory’s Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), the only species not attending vessels, has low nitrogen values resulting from a diet of flyingfish and squids naturally occurring in the area. While some abundant and widespread petrels and shearwaters, particularly those small in size, benefit from discards from pelagic longline vessels, the balance between benefits and the incidental mortality in hooks is negative for albatrosses and some petrels. Information on bycatch rates of seabirds in the Brazilian domestic pelagic longline fishery from 2001 to 2007 in the Exclusive Economic Zone and adjacent international waters of the southwestern Atlantic Ocean is presented, and bycatch rates for the area are reviewed. Overall, seabird capture rate for the Brazilian pelagic longline fleet was 0. 229 birds/ 1000 hooks, varying from zero to 0. 542 birds/ 1000 according to season. Capture rates were higher between June and November (cold season) and affected mainly the Black-browed Albatross (55 % of birds captured), the White-chinned Petrel, the Spectacled Petrel and the Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross. Capture rates previously reported in the SW Atlantic varied from 0 to 5. 03 birds/ 1000 hooks, with those based on logbooks or fishermen interviews tending to underestimate capture rates, whereas those based on small numbers of hooks or short time periods tend to greatly overestimate rates in both pelagic and demersal longline fisheries. A range of poorly-known hook-and-line commercial fisheries carried out by the Itaipava fleet, southeastern Brazil, composed by 497 vessels, was described with seven fisheries defined. Capture rates were higher for the surface longline for Dolphinfish (0. 15 birds/ 1000 hooks and 1. 08 turtles/ 1000 hooks), slow trolling for Bigeye Tuna (0. 41 birds/day) and handlining targeting Yellowfin Tuna (0. 61 birds/day). Bycatch of 47 seabirds, mainly the endangered Spectacled Petrel, Atlantic Yellow-nosed, and Black-browed Albatrosses, and 45 turtles of four species were recorded. Longline and other hook-and-line fisheries are the major threat for albatrosses and petrels from different origins when foraging in the SW Atlantic Ocean, and require urgent conservation measures...|$|R
