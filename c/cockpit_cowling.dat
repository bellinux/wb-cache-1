Caption: "New Mexico pilot died Friday when this plane crashed. Oklahoma county deputies Saturday were probing an air crash that killed a New Mexico pilot Friday and left a string of mysterious details yet to be ironed out. Identified as C. C. Brown, Eunice N. M., the pilot was killed instantly when the impact slammed him into the <b>cockpit</b> <b>cowling.</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The 1967 model 172H was {{the last}} Continental O-300 powered model. It also {{introduced}} a shorter-stroke nose gear oleo to reduce drag and improve {{the appearance of the}} aircraft in flight. A new cowling was used, introducing shock-mounts that transmitted lower noise levels to the <b>cockpit</b> and reduced <b>cowl</b> cracking. The electric stall warning horn was replaced by a pneumatic one.|$|R
5000|$|Wedell {{turned his}} {{attention}} to the larger We-Will and We-Willc, with the NR10337 languishing until 1932. In order to compete in the lower power classes, the aircraft was substantially rebuilt. The fuselage was shortened from the wing root aft, the wings were shortened while the Cirrus engine was retained. A Hamilton Standard ground adjustable propeller was fitted for the first time to the Cirrus. The <b>cockpit</b> and <b>cowling</b> were redesigned to be more aerodynamic. Aerodynamic wheel [...] "pants" [...] and [...] "spats" [...] made its first appearance on a Wedell-Williams design, a feature that would be an icon of the its larger, more successful cousins. The aircraft was re-registered as NR60Y and was officially designated [...] "Model 22". In this configuration the NR60Y competed in smaller races throughout the south during 1932.|$|R
50|$|Throughout 1940 and 1941, the Finnish State Aircraft Factory {{set about}} {{reconditioning}} the aircraft {{that had been}} used in the Winter War for continued service; an additional 50 D.XXIs were ordered in 1941, which were powered by the Pratt and Whitney Twin Wasp Junior engine, acquired via Sweden. These can be identified by their longer <b>cockpit</b> glazing, smooth <b>cowl,</b> and large ventral air intake under the cowl. The two fuselage-mounted machine guns on these D.XXIs were relocated in the wings and the vertical tail surface was increased in size to offset the new engine. Owing to the increased loaded weight, the R1535-powered D.XXI had a slightly reduced performance and was not as maneuverable as the Mercury-powered versions. In 1944, five additional Finnish D.XXIs were assembled from spares.|$|R
