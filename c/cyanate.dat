25|$|The process uses a {{salt bath}} of alkali <b>cyanate.</b> This is {{contained}} in a steel pot that has an aeration system. The <b>cyanate</b> thermally reacts with {{the surface of the}} workpiece to form alkali carbonate. The bath is then treated to convert the carbonate back to a <b>cyanate.</b> The surface formed from the reaction has a compound layer and a diffusion layer. The compound layer consists of iron, nitrogen, and oxygen, is abrasion resistant, and stable at elevated temperatures. The diffusion layer contains nitrides and carbides. The surface hardness ranges from 800 to 1500 HV depending on the steel grade. This also inversely affects the depth of the case; i.e. a high carbon steel will form a hard, but shallow case.|$|E

25|$|Cyanogen bromide {{is often}} used to {{immobilize}} proteins by coupling them to reagents such as agarose for affinity chromatography. Because of its simplicity and mild pH conditions, cyanogen bromide activation is the most common method for preparing affinity gels. Cyanogen bromide is also often used because it reacts with the hydroxyl groups on agarose to form <b>cyanate</b> esters and imidocarbonates. These groups are reacted with primary amines in order to couple the protein onto the agarose matrix, as shown in the figure. Because <b>cyanate</b> esters are more reactive than are cyclic imidocarbonates, the amine will react mostly with the ester, yielding isourea derivatives, and partially with the less reactive imidocarbonate, yielding substituted imidocarbonates.|$|E

5000|$|Direct versus {{conjugate}} addition {{depends on}} a number of factors. The structure of the carbonyl compound is important, as β-substitution and nearby angular substituents sterically disfavor 1,4-addition.

2500|$|Moisture {{absorption}} {{occurs when}} the material is exposed to high humidity or water. Both the resin and the reinforcement may absorb water; water may be also soaked by capillary forces through voids in the materials and along the reinforcement. Epoxies of the FR-4 materials aren't too susceptible, with absorption of only 0.15%. Teflon has very low absorption of 0.01%. Polyimides and <b>cyanate</b> esters, on the other side, suffer from high water absorption. Absorbed water can lead to significant degradation of key parameters; it impairs tracking resistance, breakdown voltage, and dielectric parameters.

2500|$|A second {{important}} step was {{the synthesis of}} organic compounds. Whereas the synthesis of inorganic substances had been {{known for a long}} time, the synthesis of organic substances was a difficult hurdle. In 1827 the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius held that an indispensable force of nature for the synthesis of organic compounds, called vital force or life force, was needed. This philosophical idea, vitalism, well into the 19th century had many supporters, even after the introduction of the atomic theory. The idea of vitalism especially fitted in with beliefs in medicine; the most traditional healing practices believed that disease was the result of some imbalance in the vital energies that distinguishes life from nonlife. A first attempt to break the vitalism idea in science was made in 1828, when the German chemist Friedrich Wöhler succeeded in synthesizing urea, a natural product found in urine, by heating ammonium <b>cyanate,</b> an inorganic substance: ...|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the nineteenth}} century, chemists {{generally}} believed that compounds obtained from living organisms were endowed with a vital force that distinguished them from inorganic compounds. According {{to the concept}} of vitalism (vital force theory), organic matter was endowed with a [...] "vital force". [...] During {{the first half of the}} nineteenth century, [...] some of the first systematic studies of organic compounds were reported. Around 1816 Michel Chevreul started a study of soaps made from various fats and alkalis. He separated the different acids that, in combination with the alkali, produced the soap. [...] Since these were all individual compounds, he demonstrated that it was possible to make a chemical change in various fats (which traditionally come from [...] organic sources), producing new compounds, without [...] "vital force". In 1828 Friedrich Wöhler produced the organic chemical urea (carbamide), a constituent of urine, from inorganic starting materials (the salts potassium <b>cyanate</b> and ammonium sulfate), in what is now called the Wöhler synthesis. [...] Although Wöhler [...] himself was cautious about claiming he had disproved vitalism, this was the first time a substance thought to be organic was synthesized in the laboratory without biological (organic) starting materials. The event is now generally accepted as indeed disproving the doctrine of vitalism.|$|E
2500|$|A third {{step was}} the {{structure}} elucidation of organic substances: although the elemental composition of pure organic substances (irrespective {{of whether they}} were of natural or synthetic origin) could be determined fairly accurately, the molecular structure was still a problem. The urge to do structural elucidation resulted from a dispute between Friedrich Wöhler and Justus von Liebig, who both studied a silver salt of the same composition but had different properties. Wöhler studied silver <b>cyanate,</b> a harmless substance, while von Liebig investigated silver fulminate, a salt with explosive properties. The elemental analysis shows that both salts contain equal quantities of silver, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. According to the then prevailing ideas, both substances should possess the same properties, {{but this was not}} the case. This apparent contradiction was later solved by Berzelius's theory of isomers, whereby not only the number and type of elements are of importance to the properties and chemical reactivity, but also the position of atoms in within a compound. This was a direct cause for the development of structure theories, such as the radical theory of Jean-Baptiste Dumas and the substitution theory of Auguste Laurent. [...] However, it took until 1858 before by August Kekulé formulated a definite structure theory. He posited that carbon tetravalent ad can bind itself to carbon chains as they occur in natural products.|$|E
