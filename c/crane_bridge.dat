This analysis is made up {{with the help of the}} COSMOS software who enables us to make evolved finite items – shell-type with three or four nodes per element. The shell-type finite items belong to the C 1 –class items, and they have a field variable and the I-type derivates working continuously alongside the frontier, meanwhile the II-type continuous derivates per item are not continuous alongside the frontier. These finite items allow us to design some complex structures more accurately, such as the resistance structure of the <b>crane</b> <b>bridge.</b> This example is not intended to be the only solution when designing symilar structures, but the authors of this paperwork believe that it is providing enough information and useful solutions for the analysis of {{the tension and}} deformation state in case of finite items...|$|E

Finite element meshes with 4 -node tetrahedral and 4 -node quadrilateral shell elements were generated from the solid and shell models, respectively. After a comparison of the finite element analyses, the conventional calculations and performance of the existing crane, the analysis with quadratic shell elements was found to give the most realistic results.
