40|$|An {{automated}} analyser of volatile <b>chloro-organic</b> <b>compounds</b> in water was constructed and tested using standard mixtures of dichloromethane and dichloroethane. It {{was based on}} continuous, countercurrent gas stripping of the liquid sample followed by periodic trapping of the analytes on two traps alternately connected to the bubbler outlet, and thermal desorption. When one trap performed adsorption, the other underwent desorption and cooling. Analytes were detected by an ECD detector. Integration, calibration, calculations and overall operating cycle control was performed by a microcomputer. The instrument guarantees a 0. 02 ppm Cl (w/w) detection limit, a 0 — 2 ppm detection range and 2 months of autonomous operation. Results are reported every 13 min...|$|R
40|$|Portable {{photocatalytic}} {{air cleaners}} were investigated in 24 and 48 m 3 emission test chambers {{with regard to}} efficiency and by-product generation. For this purpose, formaldehyde, decane, 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene, toluene, α-pinene and heptanal were doped at sub-ppm concentration levels into the chambers individually and in mixtures. By way of specified test protocols, efficiencies could be distinguished but were strongly dependant on the choice of test compounds, especially on whether single or multi compound dosing was used, and on long-term effects. Initial clean air delivery rates (CADRs) up to 137 m 3 /h were measured. Typical by-products were found in significant concentrations. The main ones were formaldehyde up to 50 ppb (62 μg/m 3) and acetone up to 80 ppb (190 μg/m 3). Other aldehydes were also found, but at smaller levels. The detection of chloroacetone, a strong irritating compound, at concentrations up to 15 ppb (57 μg/m 3) strengthens the importance of such investigations especially in cases were <b>chloro-organic</b> <b>compounds</b> are involved...|$|R
40|$|Wool fabric {{was treated}} with low {{temperature}} plasma (LTP) which was considered as an environmentally friendly treatment for wool fibre. In the wool fibre, the presence of scale structure on the wool fibre surface introduces {{a number of problems}} such as felting and surface barrier to dyestuff in wool industry. In the past, chemical methods were the major treatment for eliminating those problems. However, the effluents generated from wool dyeing and finishing processes are seriously contaminated with different kinds of chemicals, e. g. <b>chloro-organic</b> <b>compounds</b> from antifelting process. With the increasing of ecological and economical restrictions imposed on the textile industry, environmentally favourable alternatives were required in wool treatment processes. LTP method developed rapidly in the past decade has been introduced to the textile industry. In this paper, the LTP treated wool fabric was tested with different international standard testing methods and the results were compared with the industrial requirements. It was revealed that the LTP treated wool could fulfil the industrial requirements. The results of the investigation were discussed thoroughly in this paper.

40|$|Dehalococcoides strains respire a {{wide variety}} of <b>chloro-organic</b> <b>compounds</b> and are {{important}} for the bioremediation of toxic, persistent, carcinogenic, and ubiquitous ground water pollutants. In order to better understand metabolism and optimize their application, we have developed a pan-genome-scale metabolic network and constraint-based metabolic model of Dehalococcoides. The pan-genome was constructed from publicly available complete genome sequences of Dehalococcoides sp. strain CBDB 1, strain 195, strain BAV 1, and strain VS. We found that Dehalococcoides pan-genome consisted of 1118 core genes (shared by all), 457 dispensable genes (shared by some), and 486 unique genes (found in only one genome). The model included 549 metabolic genes that encoded 356 proteins catalyzing 497 gene-associated model reactions. Of these 497 reactions, 477 were associated with core metabolic genes, 18 with dispensable genes, and 2 with unique genes. This study, in addition to analyzing the metabolism of an environmentally important phylogenetic group on a pan-genome scale, provides valuable insights into Dehalococcoides metabolic limitations, low growth yields, and energy conservation. The model also provides a framework to anchor and compare disparate experimental data, as well as to give insights on the physiological impact of "incomplete" pathways, such as the TCA-cycle, CO 2 fixation, and cobalamin biosynthesis pathways. The model, referred to as iAI 549, highlights the specialized and highly conserved nature of Dehalococcoides metabolism, and suggests that evolution of Dehalococcoides species is driven by the electron acceptor availability...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAll-atom {{molecular}} dynamics computer simulations {{were used to}} blindly predict the hydration free energies {{of a range of}} <b>chloro-organic</b> <b>compounds</b> as part of the SAMPL 3 challenge. All compounds were parameterized {{within the framework of the}} OPLS-AA force field, using an established protocol to compute the absolute hydration free energy via a windowed free energy perturbation approach and thermodynamic integration. Three different approaches to deriving partial charge parameters were pursued: (1) using existing OPLS-AA atom types and charges with minor adjustments of partial charges on equivalent connecting atoms; (2) calculation of quantum mechanical charges via geometry optimization, followed by electrostatic potential (ESP) fitting, using Jaguar at the LMP 2 /cc-pVTZ(-F) level; and (3) via geometry optimization and CHelpG charges (Gaussian 03 at the HF/ 6 - 31 G* level), followed by two-stage RESP fitting. Protocol 3 generated the most accurate predictions with a root mean square (RMS) error of 1. 2 kcal mol(- 1) for the entire data set. It was found that the deficiency of the standard OPLS-AA parameters, protocol 1 (RMS error 2. 4 kcal mol(- 1) overall), was mostly due to compounds with more than three chlorine substituents on an aromatic ring. For this latter subset, the RMS errors were 1. 4 kcal mol(- 1) (protocol 3) and 4. 3 kcal mol(- 1) (protocol 1), respectively. We propose new OPLS-AA atom types for aromatic carbon and chlorine atoms in rings with ≥ 4 Cl-substituents that perform better than the best QM-based approach, resulting in an RMS error of 1. 2 kcal mol(- 1) for these difficult compounds...|$|R
30|$|Development of {{criteria}} for classification of persistent toxic substances {{goes back to}} the 70 s of the last century. They evolved over the last decades due to the diversification of the protection aims under various national regulatory frameworks and international agreements [34]. Japan was the first nation regulating PCBs and other <b>chloro-organic</b> <b>compounds</b> by assessing their P, B, and T properties [35]. However, they did not define criteria for a formal assessment process. Canada and the USA recognised the need for elimination of persistent toxic substances from the Great Lakes and introduced the concept of half-life of a substance in water as a measure (criterion) for persistence [31, 50]: “Half-life means the time required for the concentration of a substance to diminish to one-half of its original value in a lake or water body”. They also defined a numerical value for the persistence criterion: “Persistent toxic substance means any toxic substance with a half-life in water of greater than eight weeks” [31, 50]. With the beginning of the 90 s, various international commissions and North-American national institutions developed further the concept of environmental half-lives as persistence criteria and extended it to other environmental compartments (air, soil, sediment, ground water). An ad hoc science group of Environment Canada [22] reviewed degradation half-lives of a set of critical substances, mainly hydrophobic neutral organic compounds, such as PCBs, PAHs, PCDD/Fs. Scientific judgement was used to assign numerical values (half-lives) of 6  months in water and soil and 1  year in sediment, respectively, which became legally binding with the Canadian Environmental Protection Act [8]. The different half-lives reflect the persistence data available for the set of neutral hydrophobic reference chemicals, against which a chemical is to be compared. The group stated that “…under Canadian climate conditions  6  months is a reasonable window of time in which soil temperature and moisture favour biodegradation of many substances”.|$|R
40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} humic substances are {{a combination}} of decayed plant and soil materials that have been incorporated into a complex matrix with other organic substrates. These acidic humic substances account {{for a portion of}} the organic matter found in soil and in the soluble organic portion of fresh water. ^ These humic acids, which are polar and straw-colored, are derived from soil humus and terrestrial and aquatic plants. Considerable attention has been given to these naturally occurring humic materials since the chlorination of these acids in our drinking water results in the formation of trihalomethanes and other <b>chloro-organic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Many of these chlorinated compounds have been determined by the standard Ames Salmonela test to be mutagenic. Despite extensive research concerning humic materials, their structure, and the environmental impact of the derived chlorinated organics are still not fully understood. ^ This research involved an extensive analytical study on a local water source, Forge Pond, which is located in Granby, Massachusetts. The pond water was collected, chlorinated, and analyzed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection to determine the levels of chloro-organics formed when the pH, chlorine dose, and reaction time were varied. It was determined that these variables are critical in the formation of chlorinated organic products. ^ Water was also collected from this pond and the humic material extracted by adsorption and concentration on XAD- 8 resin. The thermal properties of the humic materials was studied by Thermal Gravimetric Analysis, and Pyrolysis/Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry was used for chemical characterization. ^ In general, humic acid showed prominent signals related to polysaccharides and phenolic derivatives whereas fulvic acid showed more polysaccharides, and less phenolic signals. A commercial humic acid showed analytical composition mainly related to benzene derivatives. ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{electrochemical}} technologies, either {{based on}} novel concepts (such as microbial fuel cells), experimental setups (such as photoelectrochemical or solar photoelectro-Fenton reactors) or materials (mainly {{focused on the}} use of large O 2 -overpotential anodes like BDD) have been devised in recent years for water remediation. Special {{attention has been paid to}} highly toxic, biorefractory organic pollutants such as the chlorinated hydrocarbons, which conjugate toxicity with chemical stability, bioaccumulation and long-range diffusivity [1]. Electroreduction at silver cathodes becomes an interesting alternative to degrade <b>chloro-organic</b> <b>compounds,</b> but it may lead to the accumulation of reaction by-products, even upon coupling with electro-oxidation at BDD [2]. On the other hand, some Fenton-based processes have proven very effective for the destruction of organic matter due to the action of •OH formed when cathodically electrogenerated H 2 O 2 reacts with added Fe 2 + [3]. Based on this, we have envisaged a potential strategy for the enhanced removal of chloro-organic pollutants and their by-products: electro-Fenton process in the bulk upon H 2 O 2 electrogeneration at a carbonaceous cathode, which can simultaneously act as the substrate for electroreduction at loaded Ag nanoparticles. To achieve this goal, a highly efficient material for H 2 O 2 production, i. e., a gas diffusion electrode (GDE), has been chosen for Ag-loading experiments. Several authors have reported the preparation of Ag-loaded carbonaceous materials based on a simple electroless deposition (ELD) process from Ag+ solutions. Some of them have addressed the full preparation of GDEs with Ag catalysts [4, 5]. Here, we report the use of a commercial GDE as a suitable substrate to obtain conveniently dispersed Ag nanoparticles. The effect of several ELD parameters (e. g., nature of reductant, mode of application and deposition time) on the surface morphology has been mainly studied by SEM-EDX. Bulk electrolyses in 50 mM Na 2 SO 4 at various pH were subsequently performed with the best materials to assess their ability to electrogenerate H 2 O 2. For comparison, carbon paper was used as an alternative substrate. An important objective of the research was to find the optimum conditions to load the substrate so as to keep the balance between covered and uncovered area, in order to favor both H 2 O 2 production and pollutant electroreduction. The performances of these electrodes for the electrogeneration of H 2 O 2 and the abatement of chloro-organic pollutants is currently being investigated. [1]	S. Rondinini, A.
