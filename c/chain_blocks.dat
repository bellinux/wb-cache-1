50|$|The figure {{shows an}} example of how Kempe's proof can fail for this graph. In the figure, the {{adjacencies}} between regions of this map form the Errera graph, partially four-colored with the outer region uncolored. Kempe's erroneous proof follows the idea of extending partial colorings such as this one by recoloring Kempe chains,connected subgraphs that have only two colors. Any such chain can be recolored, preserving the validity of the coloring, by swapping its two colors on all vertices of the chain.Kempe's proof has different cases depending on whether the next vertex to be colored has three, four, or five neighbors and on how those neighbors are colored. In the case shown, the vertex to be colored next is the one corresponding to the outer region of the map.This region cannot be colored directly, because it already has neighbors of all four different colors. The blue and yellow neighbors are connected by a single Kempe chain (shown by the dashed yellow lines in the image), preventing a swap from making them both blue or both yellow and freeing a color.Similarly, the blue and green neighbors are connected by another Kempe chain (the dashed green lines). In such a case, Kempe's proof would try to simultaneously swap the colors on two Kempe chains, the left red-yellow chain and the right red-green chain (dashed red lines).The blue-green <b>chain</b> <b>blocks</b> the left red-yellow chain from reaching {{the right side of the}} graph, and the blue-yellow <b>chain</b> <b>blocks</b> the right red-green chain from reaching the left, so it would seem that simultaneously swapping the colors on these two chains is a safe operation.But because the blue-yellow and blue-green chains cross each other rather than staying separated, there is a region in the middle of the figure where the red-yellow and red-green chains can meet.When these two chains meet in the middle, the simultaneous swap causes adjacent yellow and green vertices in this middle area (such as the vertices represented by the upper yellow and green regions in the figure) to both become red, producing an invalid coloring.|$|E

Synthetic peptides, the sequences of which correspond to motifs present in the cytoplasmic domain of the synaptic vesicle membrane protein synaptobrevin 1 and 2, prevent the effect of the tetanus toxin light chain. Our results indicate that zinc bound to the zinc binding motif constitutes the active site of the tetanus toxin light chain. Moreover they suggest that cleavage of synaptobrevin by the neurotoxin causes the inhibition of exocytotic release of vasopressin from secretory granules. ...|$|E

The {{major histocompatibility complex}} class I and class II antigen-processing pathways play {{an essential role in}} the activation of pathogen-specific T lymphocytes by presenting peptide fragments derived from pathogen-encoded proteins. The past 5 years have seen remarkable advances in our understanding of both of these antigen-processing pathways. Many new proteins that are critical to T-cell-mediated defenses against infectious pathogens have been identified and characterized. Although the direct effects of aging on antigen processing and presentation are relatively unexplored, it is likely that immunosenescence affects and is affected by the antigen-processing pathways. T lymphocytes express cell-surface receptors that specifi- phages, and, perhaps most importantly, interdigitating dendritic cells [1]. These cell types, therefore, are responsible for sam-cally recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mol-ecules presenting peptides on the surface of antigen-presenting pling and presenting peptides to the CD 4 / T cell population.

40|$|Literature {{indicates}} that the main obstacle to better manage existing WEEE recycling supply chain in the developing countries is lake of environmental laws and/or lax enforcement, particularly in control instruments to overcome the difficulty of informal e-waste processing firms and its supply chain. Policy makers may rely on new legislative framework to control environmental performance and the health impacts of pollution; however, this strategy is not clearly effective as the informal nature of this supply <b>chain</b> <b>blocks</b> the enforcement efforts and causes {{the high cost of}} monitoring. Hence, it is definitely crucial to understand the interaction between the environmental policy options and economic consideration when achieving the sustainability of operations across the WEEE supply chain. In this study, we propose the simplest form of epidemic spreading, namely a criss-cross epidemic model, and aim to examine the legislative stringency for observing the diffusion dynamics of informal and formal sectors in an e-waste recycling system. We find that a diffusion threshold does exist and it is related to the regulatory stringency. Effective population changes dramatically if it grows beyond this diffusion threshold. In particular, a government agency is able to layout a minimal regulatory stringency so that the participants of the informal sector diminish quickly and eventually cease while the economy remains unhurt. We use a simplified numerical study to test the proposed criss-cross epidemic model. Based on significant findings, this paper provides managerial implications for developing the new environmental legislative framework which is not only feasible but also beneficial to achieving the sustainable WEEE supply chain. ...|$|E

In this paper, we present a software tool QEEAT (Quality, Energy and Environmental Assessment Tool) for evaluating refrigeration technologies. As a starting point, a reference product was chosen for the different main food categories in the European cold chain. Software code to predict the products temperature, based on validated heat and mass transfer models, were written in Matlab (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, USA). Also, based on validated kinetic models for the different quality indicators of the reference products, (including fruit, meat, fish, vegetables and dairy products) a software code was written to calculate the quality and safety evolutions of the food product, using the predicted product temperature as input. Finally, software code to calculate the energy usage and Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI) value of different refrigeration technologies was also written in Matlab. All three software codes were integrated, and a graphical user interface was developed. Using the QEEAT, a user can tailor a cold chain scenario by adding cold <b>chain</b> <b>blocks</b> (different steps of a cold chain) and simulating the quality evolution, energy use and emission throughout the chain.

However, the use of refrigeration already accounts for about 15 % of world’s electricity usage. In addition, the use of refrigeration significantly contributes to global warming via emission of CO 2. In this paper, a software tool was developed to assess food quality and safety evolution, energy usage and CO 2 emission of different refrigeration technologies along the European cold chain.

40|$|We have {{generated}} a monoclonal antibody (mAb), 9 EG 7, against mouse endothelial cells that blocks adhesion of lymphocytes to endothelial cells. Sequencing of four tryptic peptides of the purified antigen revealed its identity with the integrin chain beta 1. The only beta 1 integrin {{that is known}} to mediate cell-cell adhesion is alpha 4 beta 1 (VLA- 4). This is not the integrin that is functionally defined by the mAb 9 EG 7 on endothelial cells. First, alpha 4 is not present on the analyzed endothelial cells. Second, mAb 9 EG 7 does not block the cell-adhesion function of alpha 4 beta 1 on the nonactivated mouse lymphoma L 1 - 2. Thus, the mAb 9 EG 7 can functionally distinguish between different beta 1 integrins and defines a beta 1 integrin other than alpha 4 beta 1 as a newly discovered cell-cell adhesion molecule. This integrin is most likely alpha 6 beta 1, since an antibody against the alpha 6 <b>chain</b> <b>blocks</b> lymphocyte adhesion {{to the same degree}} as the mAb 9 EG 7, the effect of both antibodies is not additive, and the alpha 6 chain is coprecipitated with beta 1 in 9 EG 7 immunoprecipitations. Surprisingly, activation of alpha 4 beta 1 on L 1 - 2 cells with phorbol ester or Mn 2 + allows blocking of alpha 4 beta 1 -mediated adhesion of L 1 - 2 cells to endothelial cells with mAb 9 EG 7. Furthermore, only the activated alpha 4 beta 1 heterodimer, but not the unactivated complex, is detectable with 9 EG 7 in immunoprecipitations and by flow cytometry. Thus, mAb 9 EG 7 defines an epitope on integrin chain beta 1, which is accessible on the alpha 4 beta 1 heterodimer only after activation of this integrin...|$|E
