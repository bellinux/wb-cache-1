5|$|Some science-fiction {{fans have}} speculated that the Quatermass serials in general, and Quatermass II in {{particular}} — with its elements including a conspiracy of silence in the government concerning extraterrestrial life, secret government facilities for alien use, and the silencing of any <b>critic</b> <b>who</b> opposes the government's plans — influenced the successful American series The X-Files (1993–2002). Kneale was invited to write for The X-Files during the 1990s, but declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{reported}} that players rarely {{need to use}} Undead Nightmare new weapons. Whitehead (Eurogamer) said that Marston's firearms are mostly indistinguishable apart from the blunderbuss, which is only useful when the player is overrun by zombies. GameSpot added that the game's combat is repetitive and less fun in the expansion, as zombies barely pose a threat. The zombies, without guns, cover, horses, lack the complexities of cowboys and, apart {{from some of the}} special zombie types, are only a threat at short distances. The reviewer found little variation between weapons when firing at close range, which is more effective than aiming at a distance. The fun of the new guns quickly faded for the <b>critic,</b> <b>who</b> found little incentive to use traditional gunfight strategies. Whitehead (Eurogamer) too noted that the base game relied on its use of cover during gunfights, which the expansion jettisons altogether. Thus the player is forced into the technique of backtracking and turning to use the time-slowing Dead Eye mode to clear zombies with headshots. The reviewer also found the controls clumsy and often tripped on piles of zombie bodies or became stuck in doorways. While the idea of zombie animals scared Whitehead, he was both relieved and disappointed to find that bears and cougars, like the humans, died with a single bullet.|$|E

25|$|During that period, Theo van Doesburg {{started looking}} for other artists {{to set up a}} journal and start an art movement. Van Doesburg was also a writer, poet, and <b>critic,</b> <b>who</b> had been more {{successful}} writing about art than working as an independent artist. Quite adept at making new contacts due to his flamboyant personality and outgoing nature, he had many useful connections in the art world.|$|E
25|$|However, all was {{not simple}} in the press.

25|$|Many attacks {{focused on}} Monica Lovinescu, who was {{broadcasting}} anti-communist messages on Radio Free Europe— {{in one instance}} during 1987, Barbu used his column in Săptămâna to belittle the work of Eugen Lovinescu, a major literary <b>critic</b> <b>who</b> was Monica Lovinescu's father; this drew criticism from the Romanian Communist Party (of which Barbu was a member) and alarm from the Securitate, as it went against more restrained official guidelines regarding the works of Eugen Lovinescu.|$|E

Both Ed Zeppelin and Fresh Cheese had left the band after 5,000,000* *Tortelvis Fans Can't Be Wrong and during rehearsals for the new album, Tortelvis also quit. Bassist Put-Mon (Gary Putman) took over the vocals, assuming the name Gary B.I.B.B. It's Not Unusual featured guest spots by both Screamin' Jay Hawkins and Randy Bachman.|$|E
25|$|The Greek text of this codex is a {{representative}} of the Byzantine text-type. Together with Codex Petropolitanus belongs to the family Π, which is in close relationship to the Codex Alexandrinus. According to Tregelles, textual critic, it has many good and valuable readings, but according to another textual critic Kenyon the text of the codex has not remarkable value, because the manuscript is late. According to Gregory, textual critic, it has many old readings, older than Byzantine text-type. Hermann von Soden, textual <b>critic,</b> <b>who</b> designated codex by ε 71, classified it to the textual family Iκa and provenance of this text associated with Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|Capote also {{maintained}} {{the property in}} Palm Springs, a condominium in Switzerland that was mostly occupied by Dunphy seasonally, and a primary residence at 860 United Nations Plaza in New York City. Capote's will provided that after Dunphy's death, a literary trust would be established, sustained by revenues from Capote's works, to fund various literary prizes, fellowships and scholarships, including the Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism in Memory of Newton Arvin, commemorating not only Capote but also his friend Newton Arvin, the Smith College professor and <b>critic</b> <b>who</b> lost his job after his homosexuality was revealed. As such, the Truman Capote Literary Trust was established in 1994, two years after Dunphy's death.|$|E

25|$|By {{the second}} half of the 1960s, critics began reassessing Krasner's role in the New York School as a painter and <b>critic</b> <b>who</b> greatly {{influenced}} Pollock and Greenberg due to the rise of the feminism. Prior to this, her status as an artist was typically overlooked by critics and scholars due to her relationship with Pollock. Since Pollock is such a large figure in the abstract expressionist movement, it is still often difficult for scholars to discuss her work without mentioning Pollock in some capacity. This reevaluation is reflected in her first retrospective exhibition of her paintings which was held in London at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1965. This exhibition was more well received by critics in comparison to her previous shows in New York.|$|E
25|$|Many grammarians adopted Alexander's {{innovation}} soon afterwards, including John of Garland (incidentally Alexander's harshest <b>critic)</b> <b>who</b> wrote grammatical treatises in verse, Simon di Vercelli ("Maestro Sion") {{who wrote}} Novum Doctrinale somewhere between 1244 and 1268 (it only being transcribed {{by one of}} his pupils when he died in 1290), and Everard de Béthune who wrote Graecismus in 1212. From that point onwards, it was rare for a grammatical work to not at least contain the principal rules as mnemonic verses. Even the new humanistic grammars of the 15th century included mnemonic verses excerpted from Doctrinale or other versified grammars. This method of Latin grammar instruction was used by teachers well into the 20th century, it still being used in English schools in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
25|$|At the reception, various {{patrons and}} curators congratulate George {{on his work}} while George flits among them, commenting on the {{difficulties}} of producing modern art ("Putting It Together"). Like his great-grandfather, he conjures his surroundings, allowing himself to hold multiple conversations at once. The only voice he finds he cannot ignore is that of an art <b>critic</b> <b>who</b> advises him that he is repeating himself and wasting his gifts. After the museum's patrons have left for dinner, Marie speaks to her mother's image in the painting, worrying about George. When he arrives to take her home, she tells him about her mother, attempting to pass on a message about the legacy we leave behind ("Children and Art"). She dozes off and George, alone with the painting, realizes he is lacking connection.|$|E
