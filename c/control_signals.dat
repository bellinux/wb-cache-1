5|$|Older {{models that}} used tube power {{amplifiers}} {{used a variety}} of 6-pin connectors, while later models used a 9-pin connector. In all cases, for a single organ – Leslie configuration, the mains power, audio and <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> are all carried on the connector, and the design of the pin layouts varies between organs and speakers. Care must be taken when attempting to service them since an incorrectly or poorly wired cable can cause permanent damage to the organ and / or speaker, or result in electrocution. It is also possible to connect multiple Leslie speakers to a single organ, by using a power relay that provides the necessary AC current.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{above-mentioned}} exceptions was a 1986 {{release of the}} film for the now-obsolete VHD video disc system (not {{to be confused with}} LaserDisc). This required a special 3D VHD player, or a standard VHD player with a hardware 3D adapter, and a set of LCD glasses that shuttered the viewer's eyes according to <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> sent by the player, allowing the polarised 3D effect to work. The other exception was the Sensio 3D DVD of Jaws 3-D released in February 2008. The Sensio 3D Processor is needed for 3D home viewing.|$|E
5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal.

An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or <b>control</b> <b>signals.</b> A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> properties, such as maximum magnitude and activity, {{as well as}} system robustness measures. We derive an ideal controller and <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> for exponential disturbance rejection for a first order process with time delay. For the resulting closed-loop system, it is shown analytically that there are strong interconnections between robustness measures and <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> properties regarding load disturbance attenuation. The results imply that popular controller design methods implicitly take <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> properties into consideration...|$|R

The <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> is relatively low energy and may be electric voltage or current, pneumatic or hydraulic pressure, or even human power. The supplied main energy source may be electric current, hydraulic fluid pressure, or pneumatic pressure. When the <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> is received, the actuator responds by converting the energy into mechanical motion.|$|R

The converter includes an input terminal for receiving an input voltage from a source, a control terminal adapted to receive a switching <b>control</b> <b>signal,</b> and an output terminal for providing to a load an output voltage generated from the input voltage according to the <b>control</b> <b>signal.</b> The <b>control</b> system includes detecting means for detecting a reaching condition of a predetermined value by a current provided to the load by the converter and control means for <b>controlling</b> the <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> according to the output voltage.

25|$|A vocoder, a {{portmanteau}} of {{the words}} voice and encoder, is an analysis and synthesis system, mostly used for speech. In the encoder, the input is passed through a multiband filter, each band is passed through an envelope follower, and the <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> from the envelope followers are communicated to the decoder. The decoder applies these <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> to corresponding filters in the (re)synthesizer. Research physicist Homer Dudley invented the Vocoder at Bell Labs in 1939 which served the purpose of improving the voice-carrying capabilities of his employer's telephone lines.|$|E

50|$|Gate {{freezing}} minimizes {{power dissipation}} by eliminating glitching. It {{relies on the}} availability of modified standard library cells such as the so-called F-Gate. This method consists of transforming high glitch gates into modified devices which filter out the glitches when a <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> is applied. When the <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> is high, the F-Gate operates as normal but when the <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> is low, the gate output is disconnected from the ground.

25|$|The A38(M) {{motorway}} (also {{known as}} the Aston Expressway) in Birmingham, England. The road connects the city centre with Spaghetti Junction on the M6. It is a 2-mile, 7-lane section of motorway with no central reservation, and a lower than usual speed limit of 50mph. Constructed in 1971, it was the United Kingdom's first contraflow road. Overhead lane <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> allow for 4 lanes in and 2 {{out in the morning}} rush hour, reversed in the evening, and 3 lanes each way at all other times. One dividing lane is closed to traffic at all times, and motorcycles are permanently prohibited from using the central, red-surfaced lane (with a fixed sign) owing to its use as an off-camber drain. The lane <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> can be set to allow travel in either direction for any lane in exceptional circumstances, which has been used for single-lane, reduced-speed running in each direction (or 2+1 with no divider) during road work, allowing the expressway to remain largely open even during major repairs. However, the 7-lane section splits at both ends to fully divided sets of 4x2 lane slip roads, with the central red lane ending in a barrier, so full use of this flexibility is uncommon and occasional overnight closure is required.|$|E

25|$|A {{particular}} robustness {{issue is}} the requirement for a control system to perform properly {{in the presence of}} input and state constraints. In the physical world every signal is limited. It could happen that a controller will send <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> that cannot be followed by the physical system, for example, trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed. This can produce undesired behavior of the closed-loop system, or even damage or break actuators or other subsystems. Specific control techniques are available to solve the problem: model predictive control (see later), and anti-wind up systems. The latter consists of an additional control block that ensures that the control signal never exceeds a given threshold.|$|E
