5|$|Gowing {{attempted}} to negotiate better {{conditions at the}} University of Kent that would allow more {{time to work on}} the books, but this was denied. She applied for a vacant <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> History and Philosophy of Science at University College London in 1970, without success. Then, in February 1972, Sir Rudolf Peierls and Nicholas Kurti informed her that the University of Oxford had created a new <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of science, {{the first of its kind}} in the university's long history. She did not expect to get the chair, but Peierls, Sir Frederick Dainton and Hugh Trevor-Roper were on the selection panel, and in the end offered the <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of science to Gowing, a woman who did not have a degree in history or science.|$|E

5|$|As their {{relationship}} had become increasingly strained, {{his wife had}} left and returned to Britain. Although hoping to leave his post in India several months early, he was concerned for his economic prospects, and desperately searched for a new position. Through friends in the British archaeological community, he was offered a job as the Secretary of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, although he was upset that this would mean a drop in his professional status and income and decided to turn it down. Instead, he agreed {{to take up a}} <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Archaeology of the Roman Provinces at the Institute of Archaeology. In addition, the Pakistani Minister of Education invited him to become the Archaeological Adviser to the Pakistani government; he agreed to also take up this position, on the condition that he would only spend several months in the country each year over the next three.|$|E

Garran served on ANU's council from 1946 until 1951.

5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} A.J. Styles against Samoa Joe next. Styles' mouth was busted open during the bout. The two wrestlers fought at ringside {{during the opening}} minutes before {{entering}} the ring. Back in the ring Joe and Styles fought {{back and forth with}} each trading near-falls. Finally, Styles slammed Joe face-first into the mat with his signature Styles Clash maneuver. Joe kicked out of the following pin, leading to an exchange which allowed Joe to place Styles in his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold. After a brief period of time, Styles passed out and the referee awarded Joe the victory and thus became the new TNA X Division Champion at 18 minutes and 58 seconds in. After the match, Joe bashed Styles in the face with the TNA X Division Championship belt and then set up to slam him on a steel <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ring but was foalied by Christopher Daniels coming to Styles' defense.

5|$|Young Como started {{helping his}} family at age 10, working {{before and after}} school in Steve Fragapane's barber shop for 50¢ a week. By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger {{got the better of}} him. He managed to tell his father {{what had happened to the}} money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{then returns}} to the trailer park setting, where Azalea rides a lowrider bicycle through the area. She wears a {{perforated}} yellow visor, black brassiere, spiked yellow Louboutins and ethnic slim-fit pants. The video then enters a new scene where Azalea arrives at a dive bar and switches a jukebox on. At the bar, Azalea's two friends from the Freightliner Truck scene are seated at a table, and a long-haired man wearing dark sunglasses awaits her on a <b>chair</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre of building. Azalea, dressed in a palm tree bikini and yellow neon shorts, performs a lap dance for the man. She then steals his car keys and runs off with her friends, who drive the man's convertible out into the desert. Azalea is seen standing in the car, waving a thin piece of material in the wind. They drive through a day and night period before arriving in Hollywood in the morning. Azalea's friends then drop her off at a sidewalk, where the video ends with her walking in the city. She wears dark sunglasses, striped black-and-white shorts and a custom-made dalmatian-print blazer in the final scene.|$|E
