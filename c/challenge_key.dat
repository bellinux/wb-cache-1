40|$|Corporate {{decision}} to scale Agile Software development methodologies in offshoring environment has been obstructed due to possible challenges in scaling agile as agile methodologies are regarded to {{be suitable for}} small project and co-located team only. Although model such as Agile Scaling Model (ASM) has been developed for scaling Agile with different factors, inabilities of companies to figure out challenges and addressing them lead to failure of project rather than gaining the benefits of using agile methodologies. This failure can be avoided, when scaling agile in IT offshoring environment, by determining <b>key</b> <b>challenges</b> associated in scaling agile in IT offshoring environment and then preparing strategies for addressing those <b>key</b> <b>challenges.</b> These <b>key</b> <b>challenges</b> in scaling agile with IT offshoring environment can be determined by studying issues related with Offshoring and Agile individually and also considering the positive impact of agile methodology in offshoring environment. Then, possible strategies to tackle these <b>key</b> <b>challenges</b> are developed according {{to the nature of}} individual challenges and utilizing the benefits of different agile methodologies to address individual situation. Thus, in this thesis, we proposed strategy of using hybrid agile method, which is increasing trend due to adaptive nature of Agile.

Current literature is mostly focussed on studying the motivations and rationale for outsourcing. However, the value added of outsourcing can be realised on the operational level only after the outsourcing event. This occurs in a process between Outsourcer and Supplier. Considering the development of the operational inter-firm relationship at the strategic level before the outsourcing decision can provide opportunities to gain value, whereas neglecting this approach creates <b>challenges.</b> <b>Key</b> words: business, process, outsourcing, model 1...|$|R

Laparoscopic liver mobilization is not only necessary for pure laparoscopic liver resection but also for laparoscopy-assisted hepatectomy. Laparoscopy-assisted hepatectomy sig-nificantly reduces the length of the laparotomy incision, and it is a good educational transition to the more advanced laparoscopic liver resection. Laparoscopic liver mobilization is a simple and easy procedure if surgeons know what challenges to expect. Here, the technique of liver mobilization is summarized, along with those <b>challenges.</b> <b>Key</b> Words: liver mobilization, laparoscopic surgery, laparoscopic hepatectom...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundInterpretation of {{double-blind}} placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) can be difficult, {{particularly with}} ambiguous subjective symptoms. Early {{opening of the}} <b>challenge</b> <b>key</b> (which day is verum and which placebo) may influence the clinician's interpretation of the DBPCFC result. MethodsFifty-one clinicians reviewing results of 19 DBPCFCs with ambiguous clinical symptoms were randomized into a key first strategy (opening the DBPCFC key before reviewing the symptoms on both challenge days and deciding on the DBPCFC result) or a symptoms first strategy (reviewing symptoms and interpreting both test days as positive or negative before opening the key and deciding on the DBPCFC result). ResultsThe proportion of DBPCFCs considered inconclusive was comparable between the two strategy groups (p= 0. 791). Participants in the symptoms first group {{were more likely to}} consider a DBPCFC as positive (in 14 tests, 73. 7 %) than subjects in the key first group (four tests, 21. 1 %). The number of positive tests was higher in the symptoms first group (median 50. 0 %, interquartile range [IQR] 23. 1 - 76. 9 %) than in the key first groups (44. 0 %, IQR 12. 0 - 68. 0 %, p= 0. 031). This was independent of the participant's profession (pediatrician or other), age, gender, or years of experience (p> 0. 3). ConclusionsClinicians differ in their interpretation of DBPCFC results when symptoms are ambiguous. Opening the key of a DBPCFC before reviewing and interpreting symptoms significantly reduces the likelihood of the challenge being interpreted as positive. Guidelines for performing DBPCFCs should standardize the moment of opening the <b>challenge</b> <b>key...</b>|$|E
