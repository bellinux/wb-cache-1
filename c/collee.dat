The script was written by John <b>Collee.</b> Nightingale and BBC Earth's managing director Amanda Hill sought to produce film adaptations to extend the arm's brand of nature programming. The two were inspired by returns for Deep Blue (2003) and Earth (2007), which were theatrical versions cut from their respective nature documentary series. In June 2010, BBC Earth entered a deal with Evergreen Films, based in the United States, to produce a film featuring dinosaurs. By the following November, BBC Earth entered a deal with Reliance Big Entertainment to finance the production of three films, including Walking with Dinosaurs. The deal had initially attached Pierre de Lespinois of Evergreen Films and Neil Nightingale to co-direct the film. Barry Cook, who joined the film in March 2010, eventually replaced de Lespinois as director.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{impact damage}} {{resistance}} of Fibre Metal Laminates (FML) is studied. FML {{is a new}} family of laminated materials which consist of thin aluminium layers bonded together by intermediate fibrelepoxy layers. Different glass fibre FML variants are compared with A 1 2024 -T 3, and carbodPEI composites. The effect of the relative glasslepoxy content in FML is determined. FML shows an equal to 15 % better minimum cracking energy at low velociry impact compared to monolithic aluminium, but behaves much better (2 - 3. 5 ~ higher minimum c r a c h g energy) at high velocities. The impact damage resistance of FML increases with an increasing glasslepoxy content. This is panly due to the strain rate sensitivity of the glass fibres. FML are also superior because during irnpacr delamination occurs, and the laminae consequently will be loaded in a more efficient membrane deformation compared to the dominant bending defonnation of the monolithic material. CarbodPEI thermoplastic composites have a poor impact damage resistance. Rkum 6 :La resistance aux digits de percussion de Fibre Metal Laminates (FML) est h d i e e.
