5|$|By the 1960s, the bikini {{swimsuit}} influenced panty {{styles and}} {{coincided with the}} cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants. In the seventies, {{with the emergence of}} skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline {{and the rise of the}} leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as <b>Calvin</b> <b>Klein,</b> particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The {{remainder}} of the decade saw Wachner take her company on a buying spree, acquiring designer labels <b>Calvin</b> <b>Klein</b> Underwear, Body Slimmers (purchased from Nancy Ganz, wife of Mitchell S.

25|$|Since {{emerging}} from bankruptcy, Warnaco Group’s annual income Reports have shown steady growth. <b>Calvin</b> <b>Klein</b> {{continues to be}} a strong performer for the company in both the jeans and intimates sectors.

It also licenses or franchises an additional 624 stores and the <b>Calvin</b> <b>Klein</b> brand accounted for 75% of the Warnaco Group's $2 billion net sales in 2009.

25|$|Deepening {{globalisation}} {{has resulted}} in a number of developments pertaining to clothing customs in Muslim-majority countries. Firstly, retail outlets for Western fashion labels are now commonly found in OIC member states: to give but one example, <b>Calvin</b> <b>Klein</b> has stores from the Citypark shopping mall in Tirana, Albania to the Plaza Indonesia mall in Jakarta.

25|$|Tommy Hilfiger {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} brands in 1990s sportswear, though Polo Ralph Lauren, <b>Calvin</b> <b>Klein,</b> Nautica, and DKNY were also popular. When Snoop Doggy Dogg wore a Hilfiger sweatshirt during an appearance on Saturday Night Live, it sold out of New York City stores the next day. Hilfiger's popularity was due to its perceived waspiness, which made it seem exclusive and aspirational. Moreover, Hilfiger courted the new hip hop market: black models featured prominently in the company's advertising campaigns, and rappers like Puffy and Coolio walked during its runways shows.|$|E

25|$|Blue jeans were popularized as {{work clothes}} in the 1850s by {{merchant}} Levi Strauss, a Jewish-German immigrant in San Francisco, and adopted by many American teenagers a century later. They are now widely worn on every continent by {{people of all ages}} and social classes. Along with mass-marketed informal wear in general, blue jeans are arguably U.S. culture's primary contribution to global fashion. The country is also home to the headquarters of many leading designer labels such as Ralph Lauren and <b>Calvin</b> <b>Klein.</b> Labels such as Abercrombie & Fitch and Eckō Unltd. cater to various niche markets.|$|E
25|$|Seal skins {{have been}} used by {{aboriginal}} people for millennia to make waterproof jackets and boots, and seal fur to make fur coats. Pelts account for over half the processed value of a seal, selling at over C$100 each as of 2006. According to Paul Christian Rieber, of GC Rieber AS, the difficult ice conditions and low quotas in 2006 resulted in less access to seal pelts, which caused the commodity price to be pushed up. One high-end fashion designer, Donatella Versace, has begun to use seal pelts, while others, such as <b>Calvin</b> <b>Klein,</b> Stella McCartney, Tommy Hilfiger, and Ralph Lauren, refrain from using any kind of fur.|$|E

25|$|Well-known {{streets in}} Rotterdam are the Lijnbaan (the {{first set of}} {{pedestrian}} streets of the country, opened in 1953), the Hoogstraat, the Coolsingel with the city hall, and the Weena, which runs from the Central Station to the Hofplein (square). A modern shopping venue is the Beurstraverse ("Stock Exchange Traverse"), better known by its informal name 'Koopgoot' ('Buying/Shopping Gutter', after its subterranean position), which crosses the Coolsingel below street level). The Kruiskade is a more upscale shopping street, with retailers like Michael Kors, 7 For All Mankind, <b>Calvin</b> <b>Klein,</b> Hugo Boss, Tommy Hilfiger and the Dutch well known men's clothier Oger.

This hall is also one of Rotterdam's famous architectural landmarks.|$|E
25|$|While Twin Peaks was in production, the Brooklyn Academy of Music asked Lynch and the {{composer}} Angelo Badalamenti, {{who had been}} responsible for the music in Twin Peaks, to create a theatrical piece which would be performed only twice in 1989 {{as a part of the}} New Music America Festival. The result was Industrial Symphony No. 1: The Dream of the Broken Hearted, which starred frequent Lynch collaborators such as Laura Dern, Nicolas Cage and Michael J. Anderson, and contained five songs sung by Julee Cruise. David Lynch produced a fifty-minute video of the performance in 1990. Meanwhile, Lynch was also involved in the creation of various commercials for different companies, including perfume companies like Yves Saint Laurent, <b>Calvin</b> <b>Klein</b> and Giorgio Armani and the Japanese coffee company Namoi, which featured a Japanese man searching the town of Twin Peaks for his missing wife.|$|E
25|$|After statehood, {{priority}} {{was given to}} establishing industries in areas slated for development, among them Lachish, Ashkelon, the Negev and Galilee. The expansion of Israel's textile industry was {{a consequence of the}} development of cotton growing as a profitable agricultural branch. By the late 1960s, textiles were one of the largest industrial branches in Israel, second only to the foodstuff industry. Textiles constituted about 12% of industrial exports, becoming the second-largest export branch after polished diamonds. In the 1990s, cheap East Asian labor decreased the profitability of the sector. Much of the work was subcontracted to 400 Israeli Arab sewing shops. As these closed down, Israeli firms, among them Delta, Polgat, Argeman and Kitan, began doing their sewing work in Jordan and Egypt, usually under the QIZ arrangement. In the early 2000s, Israeli companies had 30 plants in Jordan. Israeli exports reached $370million a year, supplying such retailers and designers as Marks & Spencer, The Gap, Victoria's Secret, Walmart, Sears, Ralph Lauren, <b>Calvin</b> <b>Klein,</b> and Donna Karan.|$|E
25|$|Musician Rudy Vallee {{was one of}} the building's {{earliest}} residents. Ginger Rogers was one of {{its residents}} during her Broadway days in the early 1930s. Hat designer Lilly Dache with husband Jean Despres of Coty Perfume were residents following their 1931 marriage until 1935. Other residents of the building have included Donna Karan, <b>Calvin</b> <b>Klein,</b> Ring Lardner, Jr., and Marsha Mason. The duplex penthouse on the 19th and 20th floors was owned by composer Jerry Herman in the 1970s, before he sold it for $1 million to Klein (who later sold it, and then bought it again in the 1990s). David Geffen later purchased it for $6 million, before selling it for $8.6 million to music executive Steve Gottlieb, who in turn listed it the week his record label TVT Records filed for bankruptcy. He sold the apartment to Marc Lasry (co-founder and CEO of the Avenue Capital Group) for $33 million in 2014.|$|E
