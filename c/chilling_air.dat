They are ductile, temperature sensitive and their machinability {{is a major}} challenge. A new approach to improve their machinability was investigated {{through the application of}} <b>chilled</b> <b>air.</b> The temperature phase transformation of the workpiece was characterised by differential scanning calorimetry and micro-milling cutting tests were then undertaken using <b>chilled</b> <b>air,</b> minimum quantity lubricant and a mixture of both. Results showed that the application of <b>chilled</b> <b>air,</b> homogenised the dendritic structure of the workpiece, lower cutting forces and reduced burr height. Simultaneous use of <b>chilled</b> <b>air</b> and minimum quantity lubricant (MQL) showed significant potential for tool wear, burr size reduction and better surface finish...|$|R
40|$|The ongoing {{trend of}} {{miniaturization}} in electronic related parts, {{which is an}} average of two times every 5 to 7 years, introduces Machining challenges. Surface grinding of thin miniature parts is an ardent task due to its warpage, induced by high specific grinding energy (10 - 100 J/mm(3)). Therefore, coolant is used to avoid thermal damage, improve surface integrity, and prolong wheel life. However, coolant, the incompressibility media, introduces high forces at the grinding zone, that create dimensional and shape instability. This article presents the results of a new grinding method when using <b>chilled</b> <b>air</b> as coolant media for thin mold insert, two-stage vapor compression refrigeration cycle was adopted for production of <b>chilled</b> <b>air</b> of temperature, - 35 degreesC; pressure, 0. 2 - 0. 3 MPa; and flow rate, 0. 4 m(3) /min.

After the curtain drew up, dreadful doubts of Mr. Barlow's considering the costumes of the Nymphs of the Nebula as being sufficiently opaque, obtruded themselves on my enjoyment. In the clown I perceived two persons; one a fascinating unaccountable creature of a hectic complexion, joyous in spirits though feeble in intellect, with flashes of brilliancy; the other a pupil for Mr. Barlow. I thought how Mr. Barlow would secretly rise early in the morning, and butter the pavement for HIM, and, when he had brought him down, would look severely out of his study window and ask HIM how he enjoyed the fun.|$|E

In vain she examined every recess of the rocks, or inquisitively explored every part of the summit that she thought could hold the tenement of the peddler. No hut, nor any vestige of a human being could she trace. The idea of her solitude struck on the terrified mind of the affrighted girl, and approaching {{to the edge of a}} shelving rock, she bent forward to gaze on the signs of life in the vale, when a ray of keen light dazzled her eyes, and a warm ray diffused itself over her whole frame. Recovering from her surprise, Frances looked on the ledge beneath her, and at once perceived that she stood directly over the object of her search. A hole through its roof afforded a passage to the smoke, which, as it blew aside, showed her a clear and cheerful fire crackling and snapping on a rude hearth of stone. The approach to the front of the hut was by a winding path around the point of the rock on which she stood, and by this, she advanced to its door.|$|E

40|$|What is the "New Jazz Studies?" Uptown Conversations and The Other Side of Nowhere {{contain a}} {{diverse array of}} {{scholarship}} that approaches the broad fields of jazz studies and musical improvisation through various perspectives and methodologies. Krin Gabbard's two volume collection, Representing Jazz and Jazz Among the Discourses, is the clear precedent for these new anthologies. Uptown Conversations and The Other Side of Nowhere continue this trajectory by moving away from jazz as a static object to be stylistically described, explained, and celebrated through the heroic and larger-than-life individual towards an understanding of jazz as a music in continual dialogue with the historical, social, political, racial, and gendered processes governing its creation. Ultimately, there are multiple ways of thinking and writing about music. However, both of these texts ignite important and much-needed debates {{over the future of}} this decidedly interdisciplinary field. Gabbard's aggressive programmatic statement from Jazz Among the Discourses still holds true for these two volumes: "jazz scholarship now faces two significant choices: it may continue developing and protecting its canon, or it may take the consequences of letting in some fresh, if <b>chilling,</b> <b>air.</b> " Uptown Conversations and The Other Side of Nowhere together will no doubt keep that fresh, cold air blowing...|$|E
40|$|Adv. Hort. Sci. In {{the current}} context of global changes, {{phenology}} {{is expected to}} be one of the major processes affected by temperature increase, notably through the dynamics of endodormancy release. However, the actual impact on bud break pattern is difficult to predict due to poor knowledge about the spatial extent of chilling sensing, which likely affects bud break heterogeneity. Indeed, contrary to a widely held opinion, the strictly local perception of the <b>chilling</b> <b>air</b> signal has never been demonstrated. The present experiment addresses this issue through local chilling or heating of selected nodal groups of buds on shoots of peach tree under endodormancy. A temperature-conditioned localizable air-jet device was designed to provide the sharpest possible temperature contrast between selected treated buds and the 'not-treated' rest of the tree structure, including adjacent axis tissue. Different chilling doses were tested over two experimental seasons, and a heat treatment was applied on single nodes in a cold environment. Chilled vegetative buds did not break when the local chilling dose received was less than 50 % of the requirements even though neighboring axis tissue received the standard chilling dose. The maximum rate of bud break reached 80 % at chilling completion and most of the broken buds produced long shoots. We conclude that temperature sensing occurs on a very local scale with the signal not reaching neighboring untreated buds, meaning that endodormancy release should be considered a very local process. The local response permits analysis of the intra-canopy heterogeneity of bud break and the possible relationship between bud status and intra-canopy heterogeneity of bud temperature...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recorded}} that alternative techniques used to keep the product on and control plagues countwith a concept that is getting better day by day. It is a chilling process of grains. Therefore, a freezing unit was used in order to cool the environmental air before injecting it into the aeration system of the structure that stores the product. This is an strategy applied to reduce the grains¿ temperature to such low values that it can inhibit or even avoid the bugs¿ development, also despite the climatic conditions [...] This trial {{was carried out in}} a storing Plant from a cooperative named CONTRIGUAÇU, in Palotina-PR, from November, 28 th to December, 23 th, 2003. Three experimental silos were used. The first one with 5, 000 tons static capacity, while the others capacity was of 2, 500 tons each. The concluding results showed that the layers reached a final chilling temperature in sequence, which means that, when the first one got into this point the same happened to the next ones. This result points out the existence of a chilling zone that takes part of the inner part of the grains as time passes by due to the temperature gradient among the temperature of the product, the <b>chilling</b> <b>air</b> temperature and the flow of air supplied by the equipment. The specific consume of energy was of 5. 12 kW. h/ton of wheat to the first silo and of 4. 48 kW. h/ton of wheat the the other ones.
