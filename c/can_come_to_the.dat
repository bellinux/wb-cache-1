25|$|When the Committee {{releases}} {{its view}} (or decision) it will outline {{the merits of}} the case or the reasons why it did or did not find that a violation had taken place. It will also include any conclusions drawn by Members whose findings differed from those of the Committee generally. This will be decided on the facts presented in the original complaint as well as taking into account the laws of the State party in conjunction with the rights contained in the ICCPR.

2500|$|The {{congregation}} is {{to remain}} kneeling in adoration during the distribution. The pastor first receives communion and then [...] "those who will be assisting him". [...] "By Christ's own words, [...] "Given and shed for you for the remission of sins", in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper God offers, gives, and seals for us forgiveness of sins, life and salvation." [...] The manner of receiving the Eucharist differs throughout the world. Sometimes there is a cushioned area {{at the front of}} the church where the congregation <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front to kneel and receive this sacrament. Typically, the pastor distributes the host and an assistant (the deacon) then distributes the wine. The congregation departs and may make the sign of the cross. In other Lutheran churches, the process is much like the Post-Vatican II form used in the Catholic Church, the eucharistic minister (most commonly the pastor) and his assistants/deacons line up, with the eucharistic minister in the center, holding the hosts, and the two assistants on either side, holding the chalices. The people process to the front in lines and receive the Eucharist standing When a person receives the bread, the eucharistic minister may say [...] "The Body of Christ, given for you." [...] When a person receives the wine, the assistant/deacon may say [...] "The Blood of Christ, shed for you." [...] Following this, the people make the sign of the cross (if they choose to) and return to their places in the congregation.|$|E
