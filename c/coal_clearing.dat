30|$|Biosolubilization aims {{to reduce}} {{impurities}} in <b>coal,</b> <b>clear</b> out lignite from mercury and sulfur or nitrogen that may form harmful oxides during the combustion of the material. Biosolubilization goes together with biodesulfurization—F. oxysporum LOCK 1134 {{is able to}} reduce sulfur content in almost 50 % (Table  1). Comparing the results with previously published studies of biological biosolubilization with bacteria indicates that F. oxysporum more effectively dispose sulfur than Gordonia alkanivorans S 7 and Bacillus mycoides NS 1020 (Romanowska et al. 2015). S 7 leaves 80 % and NS 1020 73 % of sulfur content after solubilization in liquefied product, while F. oxysporum just 59 %. Another benefit from biological liquefaction by F. oxysporum is reduction of mercury content in coal—it decreases from 164.62  µg/kg in pretreated coal to only 0.59  µg/kg in liquefied product. It is estimated that 1900 ton of mercury was emitted to the environment in 2010 {{all over the world}} by combustion of fossil fuels (Jozwik et al. 2014). Our results indicates that properly designed biosolubilization process has a great impact on reduction of harmfulness of exhausted gases.|$|R

A methodology for optimization of coal combustion conditions is proposed and demonstrated on {{the example of}} Bosnian coals. The properties of Bosnian coals vary widely from one coal basin to the next, even between coal mines within the same basin. Very high percentage of ash (particularly in Bosnian brown <b>coal)</b> makes <b>clear</b> certain differences between Bosnian coal types and other world coal types, providing a strong argument for investigating specific problems related to the combustion of Bosnian coals, as well as ways to improve their combustion behaviour. In this work, options of the referent energy system (boiler) with different process temperatures, corresponding to the different combustion technologies; pulverised fuel combustion (slag tap or dry bottom furnace) and fluidized bed combustion, are under consideration for the coals tested. Sustainability assessment, based on calculation economic and environment indicators, in combination with common low cost planning method, {{is used for the}} optimization. The total costs in the lifetime are presented by General index of total costs, calculated on the base of agglomeration of basic economic indicators and the economic indicators derived from environmental indicators. So, proposed methodology is based on identification of those combustion technologies and combustion conditions for coals tested for which the total costs in lifetime of the system under consideration are lowest, provided that all environmental issues of the energy system is fulfilled during the lifetime. Inputs for calculation of the sustainability indicators are provided by the measurements on an experimental furnace with possibility of infinite variation of process temperature, supported by good praxis from the power plants which use the fuels tested and by thermal calculations of the different options (different temperature in the boiler furnace) of the referent energy system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} not only the impact of CO 2 emissions trading on the Iberian Electricity Market (IBELM) power industry, but also the likelihood for the reduction in the electricity sector emissions. A SIMulator for Electricity and Carbon markets (SIMEC) was developed for that purpose. Given the system power plants characteristics, demand data and CO 2 allowance prices, SIMEC computes the electricity market clearing price, power generation by technology, CO 2 emissions and power industry profits. A rise in electricity prices is expected when CO 2 constraints are in place with a sharp increase in off-peak hours, when normally <b>coal</b> power plants <b>clear</b> the market. Increases in electricity prices are evaluated for different scenarios of allowance prices. Producers that do not face carbon liabilities or facing less carbon liabilities than the market clearing technology will have a positive effect on profits. Moreover, due to the fact that fuel switching takes place only for higher CO 2 allowance prices than the EU 2005 emissions trading market prices, a global reduction in the Iberian power industry emissions is not likely to occur.

Distinct seasonal variations were detected with higher concentrations of organic matter in winter. The concentration of total carbon of about 20 mu g m(- 3) in winter was about three times the summer value. About 30 % of the total carbon was water soluble. Unresolved complex mixture (UCM) and fatty acids were the most abundant components quantified in SEOC, similar to other Chinese cities previously studied. High ratio of UCM to n-alkanes (U:R) and the composition of triterpanes indicated that engine exhaust was {{a major source of}} the airborne organic matter. Emissions from coal burning had more impact in the rural areas, according to the U:R value and PAHs composition. Chemical mass balance (CMB) modeling shows that about half of the organic carbon was from engine exhaust and about 15 % was from <b>coal</b> burning. No <b>clear</b> spatial variation in the concentration of the organic matter was found between urban and rural areas. Our results showed that due to the rapid urbanization and relocation of industrial plants from urban areas to rural areas in the past 20 years, air pollution in rural areas is becoming a serious problem in Shanghai and the Yangtze River delta.

The action was intended to remind the military of the crimes and massacres it committed against the country's citizens during the 36-year civil war when more than 200 000 civilians were killed - mostly members of the indigenous Maya Indian community. The military committed human rights abuses including some acts that have been judged to be genocide, as documented by Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchú and others.

40|$|Full-scale {{tests in}} Europe and bench-scale {{tests in the}} United States have {{indicated}} that the catalyst, normally vanadium/titanium metal oxide, used in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO{sub x}, may promote the formation of Hg{sup 2 +} and/or particulate-bound mercury (Hg{sub p}). To investigate the impact of SCR on mercury speciation, pilot-scale screening tests were conducted at the Energy & Environmental Research Center. The primary research goal {{was to determine whether}} the catalyst or the injection of ammonia in a representative SCR system promotes the conversion of Hg{sup 0 } to Hg{sup 2 +} and/or Hg{sub p} and, if so, which coal types and parameters (e. g., rank and chemical composition) affect the degree of conversion. Four different coals, three eastern bituminous coals and a Powder River Basin (PRB) subbituminous coal, were tested. Three tests were conducted for each coal: (1) baseline, (2) NH{sub 3 } injection, and (3) SCR of NO{sub x}. Speciated mercury, ammonia slip, SO{sub 3 }, and chloride measurements were made to determine the effect the SCR reactor had on mercury speciation. It appears that the impact of SCR of NO{sub x} on mercury speciation is coal-dependent. Although there were several confounding factors such as temperature and ammonia concentrations in the flue gas, two of the eastern bituminous coals showed substantial increases in Hg{sub p} at the inlet to the ESP after passing through an SCR reactor. The PRB coal showed little if any change due to the presence of the SCR. Apparently, the effects of the SCR reactor are related to the chloride, sulfur and, possibly, the calcium content of the <b>coal.</b> It is <b>clear</b> that additional work needs to be done at the full-scale level...|$|R

The room was partitioned into boxes, each containing a table spread with a clean white cloth, ready for dinner. This showed that the guests were of the good old stamp, and divided their day equally, for it was but just one o'clock.

40|$|Eight Australian {{coking coal}} samples (R vMax from 0. 8 to 1. 6) from six {{different}} basins {{were employed to}} investigate the effect of coal maceral compositions and rank on thermo-swelling behavior. Coal pyrolysis experiments were conducted at a heating rate of 5 °C/min from room temperature (25 °C) to 1000 °C with a top coal particle size of 212 μm. Thermoplasticity of coal was evaluated {{on the basis of}} the change of permeability of coal pellets, plastic range, swelling factor (defined by maximum swelling %/vitrinite %), and heat of exothermic reactions during the primary devolatilization. The endothermic and exothermic processes were identified by the estimate of the apparent specific heat using the computer-aided thermal analysis (CATA) technique, while swelling and permeability of gas flowing through coal pellets were simultaneously investigated with extended volumetric measurement downstream and pressure sensor upstream, respectively. Volatile evolution profiles of heating coal samples with temperature were obtained using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Overall, the low-rank coals with high vitrinite contents showed larger exothermic heats, higher volatile evolution rates, and higher swelling factors than the high-rank coals with low vitrinite contents. These lower rank coals also initiated a decrease in permeability at lower temperatures, showed large plastic ranges, and resulted in a larger pore size of semi-coke. When we account for total fusible maceral (vitrinite plus fusible semi-inert) rather than vitrinite content alone, the trend of the swelling factor decreasing with the <b>coal</b> rank became <b>clearer.</b> However, it was found that coals from basin III showed a significantly lower swelling factor than the comparative rank coals and the heat of exothermic reactions showed a similar trend, despite these coals having a similar volatile evolution rate with the comparative rank coals. The reasons for this have been discussed {{on the basis of the}} thermoplasticity, which suggests that not only the rank and maceral compositions but also the origin and chemistry of the coal may affect thermoplasticity of coking coal...|$|R
40|$|On an {{international}} basis, coal is used extensively for power generation {{and this is}} likely to remain the case well into this century. Although many standard tests are currently used to assess and select coals for combustion purposes, these have proven to be unable to predict coal burnout behaviour. For a power station based on <b>coal</b> combustion, a <b>clear</b> knowledge and understanding of the coals offered in the market is essential to achieve optimum conversions and to meet environmental constraints. There is, therefore, a need to develop suitable and efficient methods and techniques to characterise coals so that the combustion plant performance can be predicted more effectively. In the present work, a series of experiments were conducted to characterise chars obtained from a Drop Tube Furnace (DTF) and a 1 MW combustion rig from which the effect of particle size distribution on coal reactions during devolatilisation and combustion of pulverised coal have been studied. The effect of temperature on coal pyrolysis in the DTF was also assessed. The coals used in this study were mainly from South America whose coals are widely traded internationally, and were characterised by standard tests and a novel automated image analysis technique called the Reactivity Assessment Program (RAP). The morphology of the chars were examined manually and using an automated image analysis technique and thermogravimetric analysis. The aim {{of this study was to}} provide a better understanding of the RAP and the automatic image analysis of chars, particularly related to South American coals. The results indicated that temperature significantly influences the coal behaviour during devolatilisation, and hence, the reactivity and morphology of the char generated. The structure and morphology of the char were found to play a significant role in burnout of the residual char, with a significant effect of coal type and particle size. Multiple linear regressions of char properties, such as intrinsic reactivity, morphology, and burnout, against particle size and maceral content of the feed coal were performed. The results showed that there was only a good correlation of high temperature volatiles with macerals. Subsequently when rank was included in the regressions, the correlation remarkably improved in all cases. However, when a novel approach which involved the correlations of char properties with bands of the grey scale histogram (RAP profile) of the coals was performed, much better correlations were achieved. The initial improvement is related, evidently, to the inclusion of the variation of vitrinite structure with rank. The grey scale histogram of coal takes this stage further by including the variation in reflectance for all the macerals. Therefore, the results indicate that the RAP analysis provides a simple and objective technique to predict the combustion behaviour of coals...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{whether there}} is evidence of pneumoconiosis and other respiratory health effects associated with exposure to respirable mixed dust and quartz in United Kingdom opencast coalmines. METHODS: A cross sectional study of current workers (1224 men, 25 women) was carried out at nine large and medium sized opencast sites in England, Scotland, and Wales. To characterise a range of occupational groups within the industry, full shift measurements of personal exposures to respirable dust and quartz were taken. Up to three surveys were carried out at each site, covering all four seasons. For the purposes of comparisons with health indices these groups were further condensed into five broad combined occupational groups. Full sized chest radiographs, respiratory symptoms, occupational history questionnaires, and simple spirometry were used to characterise the respiratory health of the workforce. Logistic or multiple regression techniques were used to examine relations between indices of exposure and respiratory health. RESULTS: None of the group geometric mean dust concentrations, based on 626 valid dust samples, exceeded 1 mg. m- 3, and 99 % of all quartz concentrations were below 0. 4 mg. m- 3, the current maximum exposure limit. The highest quartz concentrations were experienced by the rock drilling team and drivers of bulldozers (used to move earth and stone from layers of <b>coal).</b> There were <b>clear</b> differences in mean respirable dust and quartz concentrations between occupational groups. These were consistent across the different sites, but depended in part on the day of measurement. The variations between sites were not much greater than between days, suggesting that differences between sites were at least partly explained by differences in conditions {{at the time of the}} measurements. The prevalence of radiographic small opacities profusion category > or = 1 / 0, based on the median of three readings, was 4. 4 %. Five men had category 2 pneumoconiosis and two men (including one of these five) had progressive massive fibrosis category A. From regression analyses, the relative risk of attaining a profusion of category > or = 0 / 1 was estimated to be doubled for every 10 years worked in the dustiest, preproduction opencast jobs, after allowing for age, smoking, and site effects. Risk was not associated with time worked in any other occupation within the industry, nor with previous employment in underground mining or other dusty jobs. Symptoms of chronic bronchitis were present in 13 % of the men. Frequency of chronic bronchitis was influenced by years worked in dusty jobs outside opencast mining, but not by time spent in occupations within the industry. Asthmatic symptoms were reported by 5 % of the workforce, close to the mean frequency found in adult men. No positive associations were found between asthma and occupational exposures. Lung function on average was close to predicted value and showed no relation to time worked in opencast occupations. CONCLUSIONS: Frequency of (mostly mild) chest radiographic abnormalities is associated with working in the dustier, preproduction jobs in the industry. Although some of these mild abnormalities may be non-occupational (due to aging or smoking), the association with exposure indicates a small risk of pneumoconiosis in these men, and the need to monitor and control exposures, particularly in the high risk occupations...|$|R
30|$|Coal is {{the largest}} fossil fuel abundantly {{distributed}} {{in many parts of}} the world. The demand of energy and the depletion of high-quality coal, so more attention is focused on utilization of the low- grade coal. The low-grade coal has a serious deficiency to utilization because it associated with high mineral matter content and moisture content. The origin of Indian coal is heterogeneous in nature and consists of the complex mixture of organic (carbon) and inorganic (minerals) constituents (Georgakopoulos et al. 2003). The use of low-grade coal in large-scale unit leads to environmental pollution due to generation of the solid wastes and gaseous pollutants. It causes the increase cost of the power plants, reduce the efficiency and produces technical difficulties during processes and production steps (Meshram et al. 2015). It is necessary to demineralize and desulphurize such coal before using in thermal power station, steel plants, or cement industries, etc. The major minerals commonly found in coal are quartz and other forms of silica, clay mineral, pyrites and carbonates such as siderites and ankerites (Mukherjee and Borthakur 2001). The coal ash formed from mineral matter is both organic and inorganic in nature. High ash (>[*] 20 % weight) coal is rich with mineral content such as quartz, illite, calcite, pyrite, gypsum, and elements like H, N, S and oxygen. The high ash coal is always enriched with oxides of SiO 2, Fe 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3, and K 2 O (Ciu et al. 2015). The cleaning of coal can be achieved by both physical and chemical method (Gulen et al. 2005). The degree of demineralization of coal by various method mostly depends on the percentage and composition of mineral matter, their types, and association within the raw coal. The physical methods are based on the difference in their physical properties (specific gravity and surface properties) of the minerals and the carbonaceous part of the coal (Behera et al. 2017 a, b). The chemical method involve treatment with different chemical solvent are used for removing mineral matter, like the finely distributed mineral and those bound strongly to the coal matrix (Ma et al. 2014). The purpose of beneficiation of a low-grade coal is to reduce inert content for easy transportation, minimize abrasive materials and to improve the combustion qualities. The combustion properties of coal like heating value, volatile matter content that govern the performance of <b>coal</b> have a <b>clear</b> dependence on ash, maceral composition. Therefore, more emphasis is given for the cleaning method of coal so that it may minimize the mineral matter and improve the quality of coal. However, chemical cleaning processes are more expensive than physical cleaning steps in terms of total cost (Dash et al. 2015 a, b). The chemical beneficiation methods are include acid leaching, alkali leaching, acid leaching followed by alkali leaching or alkali leaching followed by acid leaching and leaching by molten caustic treatment. The coal cleaning by the chemical method is a simple process when it is operates under mild condition. Chemical leaching process usually achieved remove all types of minerals from the coal compared to physical treatment method. Although, chemical cleaning method has not been widely employed on a commercial scale due to huge cost related to the requirement of chemical and need for dewatering and regeneration of reagents from spent solution (Wu and Steel 2007; Waugh and Bowling 1984; Ryberg et al. 2015; Sriramoju et al. 2017).|$|R
