50|$|<b>Cefazedone</b> is a {{cephalosporin}} antibiotic.|$|E
40|$|Background: As a {{time-dependent}} antibiotic, {{the time}} of <b>cefazedone</b> concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the key pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) variable associated with the killing of pathogens. The {{purpose of the study}} was to evaluate the clinical regimen rationality of intravenous <b>cefazedone</b> sodium in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) by PK/PD study. Methods: Ten patients with mild to moderate CAP were enrolled to receive intravenous <b>cefazedone</b> sodium (2 g q 12 h) for 7 - 14 days. Blood samples were collected in any day during day 5 - 7. Sputum specimens were collected before treatment for bacteria isolated, and susceptibility to <b>cefazedone</b> determined. PK-PD analysis was performed using the noncompartmental analysis of Phoenix WinNolin software (version 6. 1, Pharsight Corporation, CA, USA). The maximal time above MIC (ƒT > MIC) was calculated, and its correlation with clinical efficacy was analyzed. Results: All 10 patients completed the study and 8 of them were cured. Six strains were isolated from patients before treatment (one for each patient) and all susceptible to <b>cefazedone.</b> Five patients of six in culture positive group were cured. All pathogens were cleared at the end of therapy. The MICs were between 0. 25 and 1 mg/L. The main PK parameters were C max 175. 22 ± 36. 28 mg/L; T½ 1. 52 ± 0. 23 h; AUC (0 -∞) 280. 51 ± 68. 17 mg·L - 1 ·h - 1; CL 7. 37 ± 1. 84 L/h; Vd 16. 06 ± 4. 42 L. The average ƒT > MIC was 55. 45 ± 8. 12 %. Conclusions: Intravenous injection of cefazodone sodium with 2 g q 12 h dosage regimen is used in the treatment of CAP caused by sensitive bacteria, either ƒT > MIC or clinical efficacy shows that such dosing regimen is reasonable...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{find out}} an {{alternative}} potential inhibitor of Entamoeba histolytica calciumbinding protein 1 (EhCaBP 1) through in silico studies. Methods: An {{attempt was made}} to find a new FDA approved, and cost effective alternative drug for amoebiasis. Sequence of the EhCaBP 1 of Entamoeba histolytica was obtained through searching the UniProt database and protein BLAST was performed. The 3 D structure of EhCaBP 1 was retrieved from Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics and visualized using Discovery Studio Visualizer® 3. 1. A total of 100 drugs were selected and docked using Patchdock and the different sorts of interactions with the target protein were studied using GS viewer, Ligplot and Discovery Studio visualizer. Results: Among the 100 selected drugs, dolutegravir, <b>cefazedone</b> and ergotamine showed large number of interactions with the target protein. Conclusions: The drugs <b>cefazedone</b> and ergotamine showed twenty and nineteen different sorts of interactions respectively with the target protein. These interactions may lead to metabolic changes and can subsequently stop the growth and cause the death of the parasite. Further investigations and experimental analysis are required to unveil the effects of these drugs...|$|E
40|$|The {{antibacterial}} activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK 0787) was evaluated in 335 clinical isolates of ampicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, 50 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 28 Acinetobacter spp., 50 Streptococcus faecalis strains, and 7 oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and was {{compared with the}} recently developed beta-lactam antibiotics mezlocillin, cefuroxime, <b>cefazedone,</b> cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and moxalactam. Among the gram-negative bacteria, N-formimidoyl thienamycin was less active than cefotaxime against Klebsiella, Serratia, and Proteus spp. but had comparable activity against Escherichia coli and Enterobacter strains. Activity of the thienamycin derivative was somewhat {{lower than that of}} moxalactam against most of the strains and superior to that of mezlocillin, cefuroxime, and cefoperazone. Moreover, N-formimidoyl thienamycin was the most active drug against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. and had activity comparable to that of ampicillin against Streptococcus faecalis. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was bactericidal at concentrations less than twice the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in all gram-negative isolates tested. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci (MIC of oxacillin, greater than 4 micrograms/ml) were inhibited at low concentrations of the thienamycin derivative (90 % MIC, 0. 25 micrograms/ml); however, N-formimidoyl thienamycin was not bactericidal at the 90 % MIC. The {{antibacterial activity}} of N-formimidoyl thienamycin against all of the gram-negative bacilli was observed to be independent of beta-lactamase production...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Fourteen healthy {{dogs were}} given 540 to 840 mg/kg of <b>cefazedone</b> (Refosporenm) {{intravenously}} {{for up to}} 4 months or until peripheral blood cell counts were depressed. Within 6 to 10 weeks treated dogs developed pancytopenia (5 / 14), thrombocytopenia (1 1 / 14), moderate to severe neutropenia (81 14), and/or normocytic anemia with erythroblastemia (8 / 14). Ultrastructural changes in bone marrow of severely cytopenic dogs included mitochondria 1 damage in hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells, thickening of endosteal bone lining layers, increased adventitial coverage of vascular sinuses, and an increased number of active mac-rophages. Swollen, ruptured mitochondria were in erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic cells, and, to a lesser extent, in macrophages, reticular endothelial, and bone lining cells. Maturation arrest was evident in both erythroid and granulocytic cell lines. There was also evidence of ineffective erythropoiesis and granulopoiesis. None of these changes were observed in bone marrow of controls, treated dogs that did not develop cytopenia, or dogs allowed to recover after cessation of dosing. Antibiotics are leading causes of blood dyscrasias, accounting for 41. 5 % of all drug reactions in man. 1, 2, 31 Although cephalosporins are among the safest anti-biotics and are extensively used in clinical practice...|$|E
30|$|Patients {{routinely}} underwent {{general anesthesia}} with endotracheal intubation {{followed by the}} placement of a uterine manipulator in a dorsal lithotomy position. <b>Cefazedone</b> sodium (1  g) was injected intravenously 30  min before the induction of anesthesia. After lifting the anterior abdominal wall, a 5 -mm port was directly inserted at the infraumbilicus with a vertical skin incision. Carbon dioxide was insufflated through the port sleeve to create a pneumoperitoneum, and the intra-abdominal pressure was maintained at 15  mmHg. The intra-abdominal cavity was inspected with a 5 -mm telescope. Transillumination was used to locate the superior and inferior epigastric vessels, and direct visualization was used to insert a secondary ancillary 5 -mm port into the left upper quadrant. The 5 -mm infraumbilical port was replaced with a 12 -mm port (Fig.  1). If adhesiolysis was necessary, bipolar grasping forceps and endoscissors were inserted sequentially into the left upper quadrant port site. The 5 -mm telescope was shifted to the left upper quadrant 5 -mm port, and an endoscopic stapler (Endoscopic Linear Cutter®, Ethicon Endo-surgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA) was inserted into the umbilical 12 -mm port. An assistant moved the uterus using the uterine manipulator on tension to one side. At the same time, the ovarian ligament, the salpinx, and the round ligament were simultaneously transected by the endoscopic stapler. This procedure was repeated on the contralateral side. A bladder flap was created by dissecting the broad ligament {{in front of the}} uterine artery with the endoscissors. If necessary, the ovary was removed by simultaneously transecting the infundibulopelvic ligament and the round ligament with the endoscopic stapler. When the laparoscopic step was completed, the carbon dioxide gas was removed, and vaginal portion of the procedure was performed in the usual fashion. The vaginal vault was sutured after insertion of a Foley catheter. Once again, the abdomen was insufflated, a survey was performed to ensure hemostasis, and we have confirmed any possible ureteric injuries in all operations by observing and identifying the peristalsis, the absence of dilation of the both ureters after surgery, and by tracing its direction to the bladder (Fig.  2). A drainage tube was inserted into the left upper quadrant through the 5 -mm port in some patients when persistent oozing was present or adhesiolysis had been performed.|$|E
