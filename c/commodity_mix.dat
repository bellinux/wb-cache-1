50|$|Agricultural {{diversification}} involves {{movement of}} resources from low value <b>commodity</b> <b>mix</b> to high value commodity mix.It focus mainly on horticulture, dairy,poultry and fisheries sector.While most definitions of diversification {{in developing countries}} do work {{on the assumption that}} diversification primarily involves a substitution of one crop or other agricultural product for another, or {{an increase in the number}} of enterprises, or activities, carried out by a particular farm, the definition used in developed countries sometimes relates more to the development of activities on the farm that do not involve agricultural production. For example, one section of the British Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) defines diversification as “the entrepreneurial use of farm resources for a non-agricultural purpose for commercial gain”. Using this definition DEFRA found that 56% of UK farms had diversified in 2003. The great majority of diversification activities simply involved the renting out of farm buildings for non-farming use, but 9% of farms had become involved with processing or retailing, 3% with provision of tourist accommodation or catering, and 7% with sport or recreational activities. Others adopt a broader definition, which may include development of new marketing opportunities.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether it is more profitable for San Ysidro Farms to establish a new <b>commodity</b> <b>mix</b> and grow brussel sprouts, cabbage, and kale in replace of broccoli and cauliflower or continue its current <b>commodity</b> <b>mix</b> for production. The goal is to determine whether the new <b>commodity</b> <b>mix</b> will bring greater profits during the months of January, February, and March. The project represents a basic comparison technique of the different commodities grown for San Ysidro. Using the current 2013 cash flow statement and others from the previous production years, a comparison amongst the different commodities has been made comparing total revenue, net profit/loss, harvest, variable, and production costs for each commodity. Using these numbers and the total acreage for each commodity, the cost per acre has been calculated to determine the profitability per acre. Over the 2013 production period it was found that growing brussel sprouts, cabbage, and kale was more profitable than to maintain its current commodity production mix. This conclusion is based on the the increase in net profit over the months of January, February, and March by $ 510, 000 from 2012 to 2013 production year...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Today, most {{countries}} are facing national CO 2 targets focused on production and direct energy use. However, two important driving forces are increased consumption and changing consumption patterns. In this paper we analyse the impact from household consumption on CO 2 emissions. Household energy use is taken into account, {{as is the}} consumption of commodities and services produced by industry. Based on Danish data we estimate the CO 2 impact from different commodities. Further, we analyse the impact of changes in <b>commodity</b> <b>mix</b> in Danish household consumption in the period from 1966 to 1992. The {{results show that the}} change in <b>commodity</b> <b>mix</b> has been insufficient to compensate for the overall growth in Danish consumption. Further, we see that the consumption of food is a main contributor to overall Danish CO 2 emissions...|$|E

40|$|The {{railroad}} {{industry was}} substantially deregulated by the Staggers Act in 1980. While railroad rates, {{as measured by}} industry-wide revenue per ton-mile, declined since that time, it is unclear why rates declined. Changes in <b>commodity</b> <b>mix,</b> length of haul, shipment size, lading weight, equipment ownership, railroad costs, competition from other modes, and demand for railroad transportation have all played some role. This paper assesses the importance {{of each of these}} factors in explaining the decline in railroad rates since the Staggers Act. After controlling for changes in <b>commodity</b> <b>mix,</b> the analysis indicates that shippers received nearly $ 28 billion per year in rate reductions as a result of changes that took place between 1982 and 1996. The reduction in productivity-adjusted railroad costs explains almost 90 % of the reduction in railroad rates, with other factors playing much lesser roles. Railroad Rates Deregulation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a CMOS 310 Mb=s receiver {{for use in a}} multi-channel 155 Mb=s Manchester-coded optical wireless link. The receiver consists of a pre-amplier followed by a post amplier circuit. The pre-amplier is a three stage transimpedance amplier with an NMOS load at the output of each stage to control gain and stability. To allow the sensitivity of the performance to key parameters to be visualized a nomograph technique was developed. The contours of the nomograph show how DC bias, dominant pole frequency and the gain of each stage vary with transistor dimensions. This allows the designer to select transistor sizes for a given bit rate and for stable operation. The design has been optimized to achieve- 30 dBm sensitivity at a BER of 10 9 The post amplier consists of a dierential amplier followed by a chain of inverters with feedback and produces rail-to-rail output swing. The design utilizes a replica biasing circuit which automatically biases the rst amplication stage and provides an intrinsic high pass transfer function to attenuate 1 /f receiver noise. The need for external ltering for the receiver is eliminated by this feature.

This paper {{examines}} {{the reasons for the}} difference in rail’s share of freight in Europe and the United States. We find that almost 83 % of the gap in 2000 is probably due to natural or inherent differences, principally geography, shipment distance, and <b>commodity</b> <b>mix.</b> However, 17 % of the gap cannot be explained by these inherent differences and is presumably due to public policies including priority of passenger service, lack of interoperability at borders, service quality and rates, and incentives of the rail operators.

40|$|Applying the {{techniques}} of decomposition analysis we estimate the relative contribution of ten variables (termed 'key ratios') plus GDP to the change in UK road freight energy use over the period 1989 - 2004 inclusive. The results are best interpreted as {{an estimate of the}} percentage growth in energy consumption that would have resulted from the change in the relevant factor (e. g. length of haul) had the other factors remained unchanged. The results demonstrate that the main factor contributing to the decoupling of UK road freight energy consumption from GDP was the decline in the value of domestically manufactured goods relative to GDP. Over the period 1989 - 2004 this largely offset the effect of increases in GDP on road freight energy consumption. While the decline in domestic manufacturing was to some extent displaced by increases in imports, the net effect of these supply factors, together with shifts in the <b>commodity</b> <b>mix,</b> has been to reduce UK road freight energy consumption by 30. 1 %. The net effect on global carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions is likely to be somewhat less beneficial, since many freight movements associated with the manufacture of imported goods have simply been displaced to other countries.

40|$|This report reviews prior {{research}} on several topics associated with {{anthropogenic climate change}} resulting from concentration of CO 2 and other gases in the atmosphere. It represents {{the first step in}} a project whose aim is to translate this {{prior research}} into scenarios that can be modelled with the Lincoln Trade and Environment Model. The report does not attempt to provide a full discussion of the many issues surrounding climate change. Instead, the intent is to summarise prior findings to provide specific parameter values that can be used as model inputs and to link those parameter values to the larger body of research on climate change. The IPCC and others have considered the impact of population growth and other trends on production of greenhouse gases and the implications for climate change. The associated changes in temperature, rainfall, and concentration of CO 2 are expected to have impacts on agricultural and forestry production. The impacts vary by country and commodity, and vary according to the timeframe considered. In addition, there is uncertainty in the results, indicated by the ranges of values presented in some cases. There are also technologies and strategies available for mitigating the effects of production on the environment. Some of these technologies reduce the creation of gasses from agriculture, by reducing emissions from soils and animals. Other technologies attempt to capture the gasses that are produced. Still other technologies and processes work to remove carbon from the atmosphere and sequester it for extended periods. The literature on consumer behaviour clearly indicates the willingness on the part of some consumers to support environmental values by paying more for goods and services. Consumers are clearly heterogeneous in this willingness to pay, however, and there are confounding impacts from labelling, information, social norms, uncertainty, and more. As a result, although there is a clear willingness to pay for green products, the size of the premium and the products to which it applies are unclear. In addition, gatekeeper effects may increase or decrease the impact of consumer preferences on producer behaviour. The research reviewed in this report provides the necessary data for analysing the economic impacts of climate change using a model of international trade in agricultural commodities. Research is currently underway to build such a model on the platform of the Lincoln Trade and Environment Model (LTEM), with a country and <b>commodity</b> <b>mix</b> specific to the issue of climate change. The prior research reviewed in this report can be considered partial: it tends to consider climate change without prices and their consequences for production and consumption. By subjecting the trade model to a combination of supply and demand shocks, the aim of this research is to build a better picture of economic impacts of climate change on New Zealand...|$|E

This finding confirms that the current high subsidy levels targeted at maize are causing farmers to relocate their productive resources, particularly land, from other cropping enterprises towards maize production. The results also show that land allocation to groundnuts is also influenced by the household's labour endowment, level of activity of the Food Reserve Agency (FRA) in the district, the household's access to market information, and the price of groundnuts relative to prices of other related <b>commodities</b> like maize, <b>mixed</b> beans, cowpeas and soyabeans...|$|R

40|$|For {{many rural}} {{communities}} across southern Africa, access {{to even the}} most basic healthcare is not guaranteed. Competing demands by public sector agencies for limited transport resources, plus poor vehicle maintenance standards, prevent public health system motor pools from being available consistently to reach health centers on a regular basis. The irregular availability and use of transport also results in higher overall costs of distribution of medical commodities due to vehicle breakdowns, higher rates of product wastage, and higher personnel costs per successful delivery. As a result, medical commodities including vaccines and essential medicines are not provided reliably or in sufficient supply, needlessly impacting the health of these communities. This paper reviews current transport practices within the Ministry of Health (MISAU) and highlights existing trends in commercial transport with a view to presenting considerations in which the two sectors could collaborate to achieve improved reliability and increased efficiency of the distribution of medical <b>commodities.</b> A <b>mixed</b> method approach was employed to gather, review and process information.

In this context, higher education institutions should prompt the dynamics of societal development and lead the society toward better future. One of fundamental task for universities is to provide positive externalities for the entire society. However, universities often face important financial difficulties to extent the externalities they provide. In recent years alternative resources also are employed in financing higher education. For instance it is universally accepted application that some of the costs of higher education are accrued to the direct beneficiaries or the students. In some countries however higher {{education is}} solely funded by public resources because higher education in these countries is considered as public good. However in the recent years, a widespread belief suggests that public resources are not fit for efficient use, therefore alternative means of higher education finance are being explored.

40|$|The hub {{location}} problem {{involves a}} network of origins and destinations over which transportation takes place. There are many studies associated with finding the location of hub nodes and the allocation of demand nodes to these located hub nodes to transfer the only one kind of commodity under one level of service. However, in this study, carrying different commodity types from origin to destination under various levels of services (e. g. price, punctuality, reliability or transit time) is studied. Quality of services experienced by users such as speed, convenience, comfort and security of transportation facilities and services is considered {{as the level of}} service. In each system, different kinds of commodities with various levels of services can be transmitted. The appropriate level of service that a commodity can be transmitted through is chosen by customer preferences and the specification of the <b>commodity.</b> So, a <b>mixed</b> integer programming formulation for single allocation hub covering location problem, which is based on the idea of transferring multi commodity flows under multi levels of service is presented. These two are applied concepts, multi-commodity and multi-level of service, which make the model's assumptions closer to the real world problems.

Assessments were made regarding whether porcine lipids were associated with specific Grooved Ware traits, i. e. decoration, substyle, geographical area and type of site. Two hundred and twenty-two Grooved Ware potsherds were analysed, 70 % of which contained lipid concentrations considered significant (> 5 μg g− 1). All the lipid residues were dominated by animal fats, although plant and beeswax were also detected in {{a small number of}} extracts. δ 13 C values of the major fatty acid components of degraded animal fats (C 16 : 0 and C 18 : 0) were determined for 126 extracts and used to assign ruminant or porcine origins to the residues; 16 % of these were found to have a predominantly porcine isotope signature. Statistical associations with pig exploitation were shown to exist with substyle, geographical area and site type, whereas, no relationship was seen between decoration and the type of commodity processed. Intact triacylglycerols were preserved in 19 % of the sherds; half of these had distributions consistent with the identifications based on δ 13 C values, the remainder differed either due to the presence of <b>mixed</b> <b>commodities</b> or because lower molecular weight homologues had been lost due to degradation. In addition to the detection of pig exploitation, results from lipid residue analysis showed a good correlation with faunal assemblages, suggesting that stable isotope analysis may be used as a proxy for animal exploitation at sites where bones have not survived...|$|R
40|$|Although {{regarded}} as a low-risk <b>commodity,</b> wheat flour-based <b>mixes</b> have been implicated in several food safety incidents. The present thesis is a compilation of five scientific manuscripts {{on the effect of}} weather variation, milling steps and implementation of pre-milling interventions on the microbiological quality and safety of wheat and milled products. The first manuscript is a review of the microbiological quality and safety of wheat-based products. Despite the low water activity, wheat flour may harbor dormant but viable microorganisms, which could lead to safety concerns when flour is used to produce refrigerated dough products. The second manuscript illustrates the effect of climatic conditions on the microbiological quality of wheat, where wheat grown under higher relative humidity and higher maximum temperature may be more susceptible to lower microbiological quality. In the third manuscript, the effect of the milling steps on the microbial load of wheat milled products is reported. While the cleaning and tempering steps did not affect the initial microbial counts, the grinding process caused a redistribution and concentration of microbial contaminants into the bran and germ fractions. The fourth manuscript reports the effect of novel tempering solutions on reducing microbial load in wheat prior to milling. Results showed that tempering solutions containing organic acids and NaCl were capable of effectively reducing the microflora of wheat kernels when compared to the traditional tempering process. In the last manuscript, the combined antimicrobial effects of organic acid and NaCl during tempering and its impact on flour functionality were evaluated. The results indicated a synergistic effect between lactic acid and NaCl, which was very remarkable in reducing microbial counts. Moreover, the impact on mixing, pasting, and baking properties was minimal. Adviser: Andréia Bianchin...|$|R
40|$|In a {{knowledge-based}} society, {{there is}} a demand for information. University libraries with their vast resources could meet this demand and in certain situations create the demand for information. In Malaysia which aspires to be an industrialized nation by the year 2020, many university and research libraries have responded to this growing demand. Eight of the universities and {{institutions of higher learning}} which have been fully subsidized by the Government in the past will be corporatized in 1996. The reasons for corporatization are many, among them to allow flexibility in the management of the institutions, including finance. The library, being {{an important component of the}} university and being one that needs enormous financial resources to provide a good service, must do its part to bring in some revenue to the university. Possible sources of revenue are Membership, Fee-based Services, Contract Research and Consultancy. Library service which was freely available to students in the past, now is a service with a fee. External membership is also seen as a source of revenue. The underlying principle is that library-users who benefit from its collection should contribute to the building of the collection. As in marketing other <b>commodities,</b> the marketing <b>mix</b> is essential. Some choose to introduce the product first and create further demand while others confidently enter the market by geographical area or by industries. Fee-based databases are increasing while some libraries tailor their services to suit their customers. Determining the price and charges on the services at the beginning is quite a problem since it is a new product. The pioneers in the field started with introductory prices but later let the forces of the market determine the price. But it is important for the supplier-libraries not to deviate too much from the normal pricing. Industries do not need to build small libraries of their own when they could have access to wider resources of the university and research institution libraries. They save on operational expenditure in terms of material acquisition, journal and database subscriptions and staffing. The future paradigm will see closer links between industries and university libraries. This could be further enhanced through cooperation of research and investment arms of the universities who already have close liaison with industries...|$|R
40|$|The dairy {{industry}} in California has two very vital sectors {{that make up}} the production and marketing landscape: Organic and Conventional dairy production systems. The objective of this review of literature is to explore the differences and contrasting views of milk quality, reproduction, animal health, nutrition, market aspects and pricing systems within each industry and determine how each industry has the potential for tremendous success among its producers. It is important to understand the aspects of each industry because of the advantages and disadvantages each industry imposes on different producers located all around the state. Organic production systems have very detailed requirements and guidelines, set in place by the United States Department of Agriculture, that greatly differ from conventional dairy farming practices and organic systems must comply with these guidelines in order to legally produce and ship organic milk. Milk quality reviews and investigation entails that conventional operations produce a greater milk yield per cow as well as higher fat and solids testing because of the utilization of diversified <b>commodities</b> in total <b>mixed</b> rations. Animal health studies have revealed that organic dairies have less of an occurrence of clinical mastitis cases than do conventional dairies but have the potential to have a greater occurrence of metabolic diseases because of the struggle organic dairy farms have with maintaining a positive energy balance after calving into early lactation. Rations in both organic and conventional production systems utilize different resources such as grass and diversification of concentrates, respectively, to maximize milk production and health. Recent innovations in nutrition and diet formulations have been researched in order to utilize the alternative technologies this industry has to offer. The demand for organic milk has been met in recent years and its consumer base for the high priced products have been established for individuals who are of higher education and have a higher income bracket than are those of conventional milk product purchasers. The economics of owning and operating a conventional or organic operation share advantages and disadvantages in production costs and efficiency and profit maximization by using new technologies. The prices for milk and feed in the organic industry both greatly surpass prices in the conventional industry {{but that does not mean}} the profit margin in organic dairy farming is larger than in conventional dairy farming; budgeting and management practices need to be monitored and well executed in both in order to have a profitable business.

Both industries will not be the best, most profitable option for every producer, this literature review allows producers and individuals to see the industry differences and that both have great potential...|$|R
6000|$|The {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} nature of Life, which have fallen within my knowledge, presuppose the arbitrary division of all that surrounds us into things with life, and things without life—a division grounded on a mere assumption. At the best, it can be regarded only as a hasty deduction from the first superficial notices of the objects that surround us, sufficient, perhaps, {{for the purpose of}} ordinary discrimination, but far too indeterminate and diffluent to be taken unexamined by the philosophic inquirer. The positions of science must be tried in the jeweller’s scales, not like the <b>mixed</b> <b>commodities</b> of the market, on the weigh-bridge of common opinion and vulgar usage. Such, however, has been the procedure in the present instance, and the result has been answerable to the coarseness of the process. By a comprisal of the petitio principii with the argumentum in circulo,—in plain English, by an easy logic, which begins with begging the question, and then moving in a circle, comes round {{to the point where it}} began,—each of the two divisions has been made to define the other by a mere reassertion of their assumed contrariety. The physiologist has luminously explained Y plus X by informing us that it is a somewhat that is the antithesis of Y minus X; and if we ask, what then is Y-X? the answer is, the antithesis of Y+X,—a reciprocation of great service, that may remind us of the twin sisters in the fable of the Lamiæ, with but one eye between them both, which each borrowed from the other as either happened to want it; but with this additional disadvantage, that in the present case it is after all but an eye of glass. The definitions themselves will best illustrate our meaning. I will begin with that given by Bichat. “Life is the sum of all the functions by which death is resisted,” in which I have in vain endeavoured to discover any other meaning than that life consists in being able to live. This author, with a whimsical gravity, prefaces his definition with the remark, that the nature of life has hitherto been sought for in abstract considerations; as if it were possible that four more inveterate abstractions could be brought together in one sentence than are here assembled in the words, life, death, function, and resistance. Similar instances might be cited from Richerand and others. The word Life is translated into other more learned words; and this paraphrase of the term is substituted for the definition of the thing, and therefore (as is always the case in every real definition as contra-distinguished from a verbal definition,) for at least a partial solution of the fact. Such as these form the first class.—The second class takes some one particular function of Life common to all living objects,—nutrition, for instance; or, to adopt the phrase most in vogue at present, assimilation, for the purposes of reproduction and growth. Now this, it is evident, can be an appropriate definition only of the very lowest species, as of a Fungus or a Mollusca; and just as comprehensive an idea of the mystery of Life, as a Mollusca might give, can this definition afford. But this is not the only objection. For, first, it is not pretended that we begin with seeking for an organ evidently appropriated to nutrition, and then infer that the substance in which such an organ is found lives. On the contrary, in a number of cases among the obscurer animals and vegetables we infer the organ from the pre-established fact of its life. Secondly, it identifies the process itself with a certain range of its forms, those, namely, by which it is manifested in animals and vegetables. For this, too, no less than the former, presupposes the arbitrary division of all things into not living and lifeless, on which, as I before observed, all these definitions are grounded. But it is sorry logic to take the proof of an affirmative in one thing as the proof of the negative in another. All animals that have lungs breathe, but it would be a childish oversight to deduce the converse, viz. all animals that breathe have lungs. The theory in which the French chemists organized the discoveries of Black, Cavendish, Priestly, Scheele, and other English and German philosophers, is still, indeed, the reigning theory, but rather, it should seem, from the absence of a rival sufficiently popular to fill the throne in its stead, than from the continuance of an implicit belief in its own stability. We no longer at least cherish that intensity of faith which, before Davy commenced his brilliant career, had not only identified it with chemistry itself, but had substituted its nomenclature, even in common conversation, for the far more philosophic language which the human race had abstracted from the laboratory of Nature. I may venture to prophecy that no future Beddoes will make it the corival of the mathematical sciences in demonstrative evidence. I think it a matter of doubt whether, during the period of its supposed infallibility, physiology derived more benefit from the extension, or injury from the misdirection, of its views. Enough of the latter is fresh in recollection to make it but an equivocal compliment to a physiological position, that it must stand or fall with the corpuscular philosophy, as modified by the French theory of chemistry. Yet should it happen (and the event is not impossible, nor the supposition altogether absurd,) that more and more decisive facts should present themselves in confirmation of the metamorphosis of elements, the position that life consists in assimilation would either cease to be distinctive, or fall back into the former class as an identical proposition, namely, that Life, meaning by the word that sort of growth which takes place by means of a peculiar organization, consists in that sort of growth which is peculiar to organized life. Thirdly, the definition involves a still more egregious flaw in the reasoning, namely, that of cum hoc, ergo propter hoc (or the assumption of causation from mere coexistence); and this, too, in its very worst form. For it is not cum hoc solo, ergo propter hoc, which would in many cases supply a presumptive proof by induction, but cum hoc, et plurimis aliis, ergo propter hoc! Shell, of some kind or other, is common to the whole order of testacea, but it would be absurd to define the vis vitæ of testaceous animals as existing in the shell, though we know it to be the constant accompaniment, and have every reason to believe the constant effect, of the specific life that acts in those animals. Were we (argumenti [...] causá) to imagine shell coextensive with the organized creation, this would produce no abatement in the falsity of the reasoning. Nor does the flaw stop here; for a physiological, that is a real, definition, as distinguished from the verbal definitions of lexicography, must consist neither in any single property or function of the thing to be defined, nor yet in all collectively, which latter, indeed, would be a history, not a definition. It must consist, therefore, in the law of the thing, or in such an idea of it, as, being admitted, all the properties and functions are admitted by implication. It must likewise be so far causal, that a full insight having been obtained of the law, we derive from it a progressive insight into the necessity and generation of the phenomena of which it is the law. Suppose a disease in question, which appeared always accompanied with certain symptoms in certain stages, and with some one or more symptoms in all stages—say deranged digestion, capricious alternation of vivacity and languor, headache, dilated pupil, diminished sensibility to light, &c.—Neither the man who selected the one constant symptom, nor he who enumerated all the symptoms, would give the scientific definition talem scilicet, quali scientia fit vel datur, but the man who at once named and defined the disease hydrocephalus, producing pressure on the brain. For it is the essence of a scientific definition to be causative, not by introduction of imaginary somewhats, natural or supernatural under the name of causes, but by announcing the law of action in the particular case, in subordination to the common law of which all the phenomena are modifications or results.|$|R
