2500|$|Usury {{originally}} was the <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> on loans; this included charging {{a fee for}} the use of money, such as at a bureau de change.

2500|$|Another scholar (Olivier Roy) {{points out}} Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's book of fatawa Tawzih al-masa'il, written before 1962, {{as an example}} of a more traditionalist {{attitude}} toward riba, or at least the <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> on loans. Rather than calling for a ban on interest, Khomeini states that lending without charging interest, [...] "is among the good works" [...] (Mustahabb) that are [...] "particularly recommended in the verses of the Quran and in the Hadiths." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{believed}} {{there was no such}} thing as a low [...] "reasonable rate of interest" [...] as rates would inevitably increased over time when the [...] "capitalists" [...] (moneylenders) squeezed the entrepreneurs (borrowers) eliminating any entrepreneurial profit. To replace interest-based finance he proposed direct equity investment, which he asserted would favor [...] "societally profitable" [...] ventures such as low-income housing that conventional finance ignores in favour of commercially profitable ones. To eliminate the <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> he proposed penal punishment with the death penalty for repeat offenders.|$|E

2500|$|Some of the {{earliest}} known condemnations of usury come from the Vedic texts of India. [...] Similar condemnations are found in religious texts from Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (the term is riba in Arabic and ribbit in Hebrew). At times, many nations from ancient Greece to ancient Rome have outlawed loans with any interest. Though the Roman Empire eventually allowed loans with carefully restricted interest rates, the Catholic Church in medieval Europe banned the <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> at any rate (as well as charging a fee {{for the use of}} money, such as at a bureau de change).|$|E
2500|$|One concept {{instrumental}} in explaining (and defending) the <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> on loans is [...] the [...] time value of money—the {{idea that there}} is greater benefit in receiving money now rather than later, so that later payment should be discounted and savers/investors/lenders who [...] defer consumption be compensated. [...] As such, some Islamic finance supporters have attacked [...] the concept, [...] Irfan argues that the value of money diminishes very little over time because some consumption—such as eating—can only be done over time, and that negative outcomes such as [...] unsustainable production leading to desertification, are encouraged by discounting for time since the desertification comes in the discounted future.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 20th century (mid-1970s) however, Islamic revivalists/activists/Islamists {{have worked to}} revive and {{rejuvenate}} the definition of interest as riba, to enjoin Muslims to lend and borrow at [...] "Islamic Banks" [...] that avoided fixed rates, and to mobilize to pressure governments to ban the <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> In 1976, King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah organized the First International Conference on Islamic Economics in Makkah. At the conference, [...] "several hundred Muslim intellectuals, Shari'ah scholars and economists unequivocally declared ... that all forms of interest [...] riba". [...] By 2009, over 300 banks and 250 mutual funds around the world complied with this definition of riba and disavowed interest on loans or deposits, and by 2014 around $2 trillion in assets were [...] "sharia-compliant".|$|E

2500|$|On March 17, 1808, Napoleon I created three decrees in {{a failed}} attempt to bring {{equality}} and to integrate the Jews into French society after the Jewish Emancipation of 1790-1791. The Infamous Decree, the third of the three, had adverse effects. Although the decrees´ aim was to further emancipate the Jews into equal citizenship, it restricted Jewish money lending (Catholics were not permitted to commit acts of usury, or the <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> as profit [...] on loans), it anulled all debts owed to Jews by non Jewish debtors and limited the residency of new Jewish peoples in France by [...] restricting all business activities while allowing work in agriculture and regular craftsmanship. The combination of these decrees severely weakened the financial position of once dominant rural French money lending Jews.|$|E
2500|$|The natural rate of rent {{is related}} to his {{theories}} on usury. At the time, many religious writers still condemned the <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> as sinful. Petty also involved himself in the debate on usury and interest rates, regarding the phenomenon {{as a reward for}} forbearance {{on the part of the}} lender. Incorporating his theories of value, he asserted that, with perfect security, the rate of interest should equal the rent for land that the principal could have bought – again, a precocious insight into what would later become general equilibrium findings. Where security was more 'casual', the return should be greater – a return for risk. Having established the justification for usury itself, that of forbearance, he then shows his Hobbesian qualities, arguing against any government regulation of the interest rate, pointing to the 'vanity and fruitlessness of making civil positive laws against the laws of nature' ...|$|E
2500|$|St. Thomas Aquinas, {{the leading}} {{scholastic}} theologian of the Roman Catholic Church, argued <b>charging</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is wrong because {{it amounts to}} [...] "double charging", charging for both the thing {{and the use of}} the thing. Aquinas said this would be morally wrong in the same way as if one sold a bottle of wine, charged for the bottle of wine, and then charged for the person using the wine to actually drink it. Similarly, one cannot charge for a piece of cake and for the eating of the piece of cake. Yet this, said Aquinas, is what usury does. Money is a medium of exchange, and is used up when it is spent. To charge for the money and for its use (by spending) is therefore to charge for the money twice. It is also to sell time since the usurer charges, in effect, for the time that the money is in the hands of the borrower. Time, however, is not a commodity that anyone can charge. [...] In condemning usury Aquinas was much influenced by the recently rediscovered philosophical writings of Aristotle and his desire to assimilate Greek philosophy with Christian theology. Aquinas argued that in the case of usury, as in other aspects of Christian revelation, Christian doctrine is reinforced by Aristotelian natural law rationalism. [...] Aristotle's argument is that interest is unnatural, since money, as a sterile element, cannot naturally reproduce itself. [...] Thus, usury conflicts with natural law just as it offends Christian revelation: see Thought of Thomas Aquinas.|$|E
