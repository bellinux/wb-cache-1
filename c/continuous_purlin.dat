40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the {{investigation}} of the structural behaviour of cold-formed steel flooring and purlin systems, taking into consideration the beneficial effect of interaction between structural components. Experiments have been conducted on flooring systems comprising cold-formed steel joists and wood-based particle boards, considering the typical screw fixings employed in current practice as well as alternative means of shear connection. The experimental findings showed that mobilisation of composite action within this type of system, through enhancement, beyond that currently used, of the employed shear connection, is feasible, bringing corresponding increases in capacity and stiffness. In order for the influence of the key parameters to be further examined, a finite element model simulating the examined systems has been developed, validated and employed for parametric studies. Analyses confirmed the experimental findings, showing that significant benefits in terms of capacity and stiffness can be achieved, especially for systems comprising thinner steel sections. Based on the obtained experimental and numerical results, a full design method, following the fundamental concepts of current design codes for composite structures, has been devised, providing accurate predictions of moment capacity and flexural stiffness. Finally, a numerical investigation has been performed on continuous two-span roof systems comprising cold-formed steel purlins, accounting for their interaction with the corrugated sheeting. The study showed that moment redistribution is possible within these systems, but usually accompanied by a reduction of the moment capacity of the central support. A previously devised method for the design of <b>continuous</b> <b>purlin</b> systems, making direct use of cross-section capacities at key locations, together with a factor to allow for the fall-off in moment at the central support, has been assessed and advanced.

40|$|Lapped joints of cold-formed steel (CFS) Z-shaped purlins are {{extensively}} used {{in metal}} building roof systems. The {{research that has}} been carried out so far for these lapped connections is primarily focused on connections with round holes. However, the lapped connections with vertical slotted holes are extensively used in current construction practice to simplify the erection of <b>continuous</b> Z-shaped roof <b>purlins.</b> There is no design guideline or recommendation available for CFS Z-purlin lapped connections with vertical slotted holes. Presented in this paper are the results of an experimental study and analysis of the structural behaviour of lapped CFS Z-shaped purlin connections with vertical slotted holes. 42 flexural tests were performed on lapped CFS Z-shaped purlins with vertical slotted connections with different lap lengths, purlin depths, thicknesses and spans. The flexural strength and deflection of each specimen were measured. The characteristics of moment resistance and flexure stiffness of the lapped purlins were computed. The test results show that the lapped purlins with vertical slotted holes may be more flexible than the lapped purlins with round holes or <b>continuous</b> <b>purlins</b> without lapped joint. Thus, the slotted connections may need greater lap lengths to achieve full stiffness of <b>continuous</b> <b>purlins.</b> The results also indicate that the characteristics of moment resistance and flexural stiffness in the slotted connections are dependent on the ratio of lap length to purlin depth, the ratio of lap length to purlin thickness, the ratio of purlin depth to purlin thickness, and the ratio of lap length to span. Based on the results, design recommendations for evaluating the moment resistance and flexural stiffness of lapped slotted connections were proposed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a finite element {{programme}} for material and geometric nonlinear analysis, has been modified with pre- and post-data processing and eigenvalue solution. More efficient methods to solve elastic and inelastic eigenvalue and eigenvectors {{have been developed}} to deal with stability problems in structures with arbitrary shape, irregular stiffness, loads and boundary conditions. The Generalized Beam Theory (GBT) with the facilities of elastic spring restraints, buckling under coupled loads, different load locations has been developed and programmed by the author. It has been applied to reveal the basic behaviour and the interaction between the modes of light gauge steel members. It has been found that the AISI design approach with elastic bucking stresses obtained using GBT can be used to correctly predict the strength of compression thin-walled columns. Three different types of widely used light gauge steel members, namely rack columns, purlins and decks, have been analyzed using both FEM and GBT. The comparison of results from the numerical analyses and comprehensive tests agrees well. The author has risen to the challenge of complicated buckling problems and a pseudo-plastic design procedure for a <b>continuous</b> <b>purlins</b> and roof decks has been established {{in order to make the}} best us of the materials. Through the highly complex analyses, some important conclusions for composite deck profiles in the wet concrete stage have been obtained. The ECCS and AISI design approaches for bending have been found to be conservative when the deck is subject to plastic buckling or strength failure. The calculation of the ultimate web crippling load without consideration of bending moment is awkward and further light is shed on this topical problem. The influence of dimples in reducing the deck bending resistance mainly depends on the flange slendernes...|$|R
40|$|Laterally braced cold-formed steel beams {{generally}} fail due {{to local}} or distortional buckling. When the compression flange is not restrained by attachment to sheathing or paneling, {{such as in}} negative bending of <b>continuous</b> members (joist, <b>purlins,</b> etc.), members are prone to distortional failures. However, distortional buckling remains a largely unaddressed problem in {{the main body of}} the North American Specification (NAS 2001). Only a limited amount of experimental data on unrestricted distortional buckling in bending is available, therefore a new series of distortional buckling tests was completed. The test details are selected specifically to insure that distortional buckling is free to form, but lateral buckling is restricted. Several design methods...|$|R
40|$|Cold formed &quot;Z &quot; purlins {{are widely}} used in civil {{engineering}} structures. An important advantage is the great flexibility of producing different geometry of this profile. In cold formed structures it is difficult (practically impossible) to change the shape along the element, so it is recommended to have &quot;economic &quot; shape of cross section of such purlin. The optimization process was incorporated for “Z ” purlin that works as simple beam under <b>continuous</b> load. <b>Purlins</b> were optimized for different spans and different loads. Optimization process was solved with use of genetic algorithms. This method was chosen {{because it is the}} most suitable for discreet problems with many nonlinear parameters. In addition, methods supported by genetic algorithms predominate other methods (like one direction searching method). Moreover this method was successfully exploited by us in other problems like cost and shape optimization of portal frame made of welded I beams/columns. The shape optimization were taken into consideration. Design variables were geometry of cross section, and grade of steel. Constraints were based on European national standards (Eurocode – 3, for cold formed structures). Ultimate and serviceability limit states were taken into account for elements undergoing bending. Results of analysis are presented in tables (optimal dimensions of cross sections, and grade of steel) for different spans and continuous loads. The main objective of this paper is an implementation of these results in industry (especially by producers an...|$|R
40|$|Cold {{formed steel}} (CFS) sigma {{sections}} {{are commonly used}} as purlins {{in the construction of}} modern industrial and residential buildings due to their excellent strength-to-weight ratio. This thesis reports investigations on the structural behaviour of CFS sigma purlins in three different parts of modern roof systems. In the first investigation, the pre-buckling, buckling, post-buckling and post-failure behaviour of <b>continuous</b> CFS sigma <b>purlins</b> near internal supports was studied by experimental and numerical methods. In the second investigation, the moment-rotation response as well as the moment resistance of the sleeve connection of sigma purlins was studied by laboratory tests. Engineering models were developed to predict the behaviour of this connection and a good correlation was observed with the experimental data. In the third investigation, the flexural stiffness and moment resistance of CFS sigma purlins fastened to roof sheeting with large screw spacing was studied experimentally. The purlin-sheeting assemblies were subjected to both downward and uplift loadings, from which different behavioural aspects such as flexural stiffness, failure modes and ultimate load were examined. Test results are utilized to develop design proposals for sigma purlins that codes or standards have not yet covered. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Distortional {{buckling}} of cold-formed steel C and Z {{members in}} bending remains an unaddressed {{problem in the}} current North American Specification (AISI 2002). When the compression flange is not stabilized by fastening to panels or sheathing, such as in negative bending of <b>continuous</b> members (joists, <b>purlins,</b> etc.) and wind suction on walls and panels (without interior sheathing) members are prone to distortional failures. Adequate experimental data on unrestricted distortional buckling in bending is unavailable. It is proposed to extend a recently completed experimental project on local buckling of C and Z members in bending, to a second phase on distortional buckling. Further, it is proposed to begin work on understanding the role of restraint in distortional buckling both experimentally and numerically. The experimental work may be completed by using geometry {{similar to that of}} the Phase 1 testing, but removing the through-fastened panel attached to the compression flange. Subsequently, exploratory work on fastener details and panel stiffness may be pursued. The experimental data will help develop and validate an efficient and reliable design procedure for C and Z members in bending with and without panels attached to the compression flange failing in local or distortional buckling and form the basis for more advanced design methods that account for situations of partial restraint...|$|R
