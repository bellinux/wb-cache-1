50|$|KOI8-B is the {{informal}} name for an 8-bit Roman / <b>Cyrillic</b> <b>character</b> <b>set</b> derived from KOI8-R, but {{with only the}} letter subset defined. As such it was implemented by some font vendors for PC Unixes like Xenix in the late 1980s.|$|E
50|$|In summer 2010, FontFont {{introduced}} {{a completely new}} drawn round version called FF DIN Round, including five weights (Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Black). Assisted by Ivo Gabrowitsch of FontShop International, Albert-Jan Pool wrote the brochure FF DIN Round - digital block letters. It provides additional information on both the design {{and the history of}} round sans serif typefaces. FF DIN Round Pro also includes a <b>Cyrillic</b> <b>character</b> <b>set</b> for all weights.|$|E
50|$|This is an {{expanded}} version of Frutiger Next W1G. It added Greek (from Frutiger Next Greek) and <b>Cyrillic</b> <b>character</b> <b>sets,</b> but advertised OpenType features {{were reduced to}} superscript and subscript. Only an OpenType version has been produced.|$|R
50|$|The family {{includes}} five font weights in two widths (Normal and Condensed), {{each with}} italics. The entire family includes extended characters such as arrows, fractions, Euro sign, lozenge, mathematical symbols, extra accented Latin letters, and superscript numeral figures. Alternate glyphs include rounded dots, old style figures, and alternate cedilla. With time Eastern European, Greek and <b>Cyrillic</b> <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> {{have been added}} as well.|$|R
50|$|Palatino's early {{digitisation}} {{intended for}} PostScript use is very widely used or cloned. Later Palatino digitisations have different features and spacing. In 1999, Zapf revised Palatino for Linotype and Microsoft, called Palatino Linotype. The revised family incorporated extended Latin, Greek, and <b>Cyrillic</b> <b>character</b> <b>sets.</b> Linotype released {{a more complex}} redesign named Palatino nova, together with digitisations of some of Zapf's other Renaissance-inspired designs and Aldus. Zapf also created a matching Palatino Sans and Palatino Sans Informal design in 2006.|$|R
50|$|Its {{development}} was initiated in the IPK Minavtoproma in Moscow in 1981, and development continued in cooperation from other institutes, including Kurchatov Institute. MNOS and its alternative,DEMOS version 1.x, were gradually merged from 1986 until 1990 {{resulting in the}} joint OS, DEMOS version 2.x.MNOS became the first completely bilingual version of Unix, and used the proprietary 8-bit <b>Cyrillic</b> <b>character</b> <b>set,</b> U-code, which was later dropped in favor of KOI-8 {{in the process of}} merging with DEMOS.|$|E
40|$|The LISP machine based {{software}} {{which had}} been developed by Siemens AG in the 1970 ies for the METAL system to translate between West European languages was re-implemented in C++ to make it portable to PCs. The first extension of this system to cover a Slavonic language (Russian) had to solve {{a huge number of}} problems related to the inclusion of the <b>Cyrillic</b> <b>character</b> <b>set.</b> As from the middle of 1997 the goal of the Russian-to-German part of the project was extended from a prototype to a product, it furthermore became necessary to include all important aspects of a user-friendly interface to the system into the work programme. In addition, a number of tools to support the system developers were provided. (orig.)

50|$|The full Underground Pro Set {{contains}} nineteen Pro OpenType fonts and 58 Basic OpenType fonts, covering extended Latin, Greek, <b>Cyrillic</b> <b>character</b> <b>sets.</b> Weights are {{expanded to}} six: Thin, Light, Book, Medium, Demi, Heavy. Underground, Underground CY, Underground GR support extended Latin, <b>Cyrillic,</b> Greek <b>characters</b> respectively. The Latin sub-family contains medium weight Titling fonts, which feature underscored and/or overscored Latin small letters. Pro fonts include extensive OpenType features, including eleven stylistic sets with stylistic alternates inspired by early signs, Johnston's calligraphy and draft designs for Johnton and geometric sans designs such as Futura. Following {{the lead of}} Johnston's original, P22 decided not to offer an italic.|$|R
5000|$|The Segoe UI {{typeface}} is {{the default}} font for Aero with languages that use Latin, Greek, and <b>Cyrillic</b> <b>character</b> <b>sets.</b> The default font size is also increased from 8pt to 9pt to improve readability. In the Segoe UI typeface prior to Windows 8, the numeral zero ("0") is narrow, while capital letter [...] "O" [...] is wider (Windows 8's Segoe UI keeps this difference), and numeral one ("1") has a top hook, while capital letter [...] "I" [...] has equal crown and base (Windows 8's [...] "1" [...] has no base, and the [...] "I" [...] {{does not have}} a crown or base).|$|R
50|$|While URIs {{are limited}} to {{a subset of the}} ASCII <b>character</b> <b>set,</b> IRIs may contain {{characters}} from the Universal <b>Character</b> <b>Set</b> (Unicode/ISO 10646), including Chinese or Japanese kanji, Korean, <b>Cyrillic</b> <b>characters,</b> and so forth.|$|R
50|$|Iowan {{began as}} a design for ITC but after they dropped plans to release it was bought up by Matthew Carter of Bitstream, who {{digitised}} and released it. Bitstream later revisited the design, adding ornaments and capitals for titling. The <b>character</b> <b>set</b> includes small capitals and ligatures, as well as <b>Cyrillic</b> <b>characters.</b> Stephen Coles, an expert on digital fonts, has described its design as 'hardworking'.|$|R

50|$|This {{flag was}} adopted by the Byelorussian SSR on December 25, 1951. Prior to this, the flag was red with the <b>Cyrillic</b> <b>characters</b> БССР (BSSR) in gold in the top-left corner, {{surrounded}} by a gold border. Between 1937 and the adoption of the above flag in the 1940s, the flag was the same, but with a gold hammer and sickle above the <b>Cyrillic</b> <b>characters</b> and no border. Between 1919 and 1937, the flag was red, with the <b>Cyrillic</b> <b>characters</b> ССРБ (SSRB) in the top left-hand corner. In early 1919, a plain red flag was used. The final BySSR flag was used until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. A flag based on this design is used as the current national flag of Belarus.|$|R
