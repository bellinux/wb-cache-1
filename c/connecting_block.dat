Because of this property, in a <b>connected</b> <b>block</b> graph, every set of vertices has a unique minimal connected superset, its closure in the convex geometry.

50|$|A 66 {{block is}} a type of punchdown block used to connect sets of wires in a {{telephone}} system. They have been manufactured in three sizes, A, B, and M. A and B have six clips in each row while M has only 4. The A blocks spaced the rows farther apart, and has been obsolete for many years. The B style is used mainly in distribution panels where several destinations (often 1A2 key telephones) need to connect to the same source. The M blocks are often used to connect a single instrument to such a distribution block. 66 blocks are designed to terminate 22 through 26 AWG solid copper wire. The 66 series <b>connecting</b> <b>block,</b> introduced in the Bell System in 1962, was the first terminating device with insulation displacement connector technology. The term 66 block reflects its Western Electric model number.|$|E
50|$|Barclay House, {{also known}} as the Joshua Hartshorne Estate, North Hill, and The Barclay, is a {{historic}} home located in West Chester, Chester County, Pennsylvania. The original section was built in 1866-67, and believed to have been designed by noted architect Addison Hutton (1834-1916). It was a -story, brick dwelling in the Italianate style. It was expanded to three stories with the expansion of 1935-36. Also added at that time was a three-story <b>connecting</b> <b>block,</b> three-story west block, and one-story north block. The house was also renovated in the Colonial Revival style. The north block was expanded to two stories in 1998. Also on the property is a contributing carriage house built in 1869. It was converted to a residence in 1925. It was built as a single family residence, but converted to a Quaker boarding home for the elderly in 1935-1936. The boarding home closed at this location in 1997.|$|E
50|$|In spring 1914, {{plans were}} made for a larger Hall of Residence. In early summer an arts block with 28 large and many smaller lecture rooms and a <b>connecting</b> <b>block</b> for biology, chemistry, physics and {{engineering}} opened on 20 June. Then, eight days later, the First World War began after the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand in Serajevo with profound implications {{for the future of}} the university. The war prevented the move from Hartley College to Highfield campus for five years and disrupted Hills plans. The new buildings were given over to the War Office for use as a hospital, as was Highfield Hall for the Red Cross. During the war Hill acted as Medical Officer to the Red Cross hospital and made channel crossings on hospital ships tending to the wounded. Student numbers and finances suffered severely. It was 1919-1920 when the War Office had finally moved out and the new buildings could be occupied at last and Highfield Hall re-occupied and the move to the Highfield campus made, after which Hill resigned.|$|E

40|$|Control of {{flowering}} time {{is critical for}} reproductive success. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) encodes part of florigen, which moves from leaves to the shoot apex to induce the floral transition. Under inductive long days (LD), transcription activation is mainly mediated by CONSTANS (CO). The epigenetic repressor LHP 1, which associates with H 3 K 27 me 3, antagonizes CO activity in vascular tissues at FT. The 5. 7 kb sequence upstream of the FT translation start codon contains sufficient regulatory elements to mediate spatial and temporal expression of FT. On this full length FT promoter, phylogenetic analysis identified three conserved blocks, each around 300 bp, called Block A, B and C. The aim of my {{study was to identify}} and characterize functional cis-elements within the conserved blocks and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of FT transcription regulation. My results indicate that Block C (5. 2 to 5. 6 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site) is necessary for FT expression in LD conditions, and that CCAAT boxes in Block C and close to Block A at the proximal promoter impair the efficiency of a full length FT promoter. Mutagenesis of either one of four conserved sub-blocks in Block C dramatically reduces promoter activity. Although Block C acts as distal enhancer, it requires specific sequences contained in Block A to convey phloem-specific expression of FT in leaves. Through Chromosome Conformation Capture (3 C) assays, a weak long-distance physical interaction between Block C and A could be detected. The distance between Block C and A displays natural variation among different A. thaliana accessions. Shortening the distance between the blocks by deleting 3. 5 kb intersecting region or directly <b>connecting</b> <b>Block</b> C and A, generated shorter versions of the FT promoter that mimic the full-length promoter function in response to LDs. How the repressive histone mark H 3 K 27 me 3 and LHP 1 contribute to FT regulation is still unclear. To study differential enrichment of H 3 K 27 me 3 at the FT promoter, nuclei were isolated by INTACT (isolation of nuclei tagged in specific cell types) from the leaf phloem of plants grown in LD or SD conditions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that the abundance of H 3 K 27 me 3 at Block C and A regions negatively correlated with FT expression levels in the phloem. Taken together, the distal enhancer Block C and Block A in the proximal promoter are accessible in leaf phloem cells and required and sufficient for FT expression in LD conditions. ...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 83 - 87). The segmentation {{and recognition}} of Arabic handwritten text has been an area of great interest {{in the past few}} years. However, a small number of research papers and reports have been published in this area. There are several major problems with Arabic handwritten text processing: Arabic is written cursively and many external objects are used such as dots, 'HanlZa', 'Madda', and diacritic objects. In addition, Arabic characters have more than one shape according to their position inside a word. More than one character can also share the same horizontal space, creating vertically overlapping <b>connected</b> or disconnected <b>blocks</b> of characters. This makes the problem of segmentation of Arabic text into characters, and their classification even more difficult. In this work a technique is presented that segments difficult handwritten Arabic text. A conventional algorithm is used for the initial segmentation of the text into <b>connected</b> <b>blocks</b> of characters. The algorithm then generates pre-segmentation points for these blocks. A neural network is subsequently used to verify the accuracy of these segmentation points. Another conventional algorithm uses the verified segmentation points and segments the <b>connected</b> <b>blocks</b> of characters. These characters can then be used as input to another neural network for classification. Two major problems were encountered in the above scenario. First, the segmentation phase proved to be successful in vertical segmentation of <b>connected</b> <b>blocks</b> of characters. However, it couldn't segment characters that were overlapping horizontally, and this affects any neural network classifier. Second, {{there are a lot of}} handwritten characters that can be segmented and classified into two or more different classes depending on whether you look at them separately, or in a word, or even in a sentence. In other words, character segmentation and classification, especially handwritten Arabic characters, depends largely on contextual information, and not only on topographic features extracted from these characters. 1 bound copy: 87 leaves; ill.
