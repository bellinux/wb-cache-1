5|$|The <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> of {{the project}} was {{originally}} given as November 2012 or early 2013. The estimated <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> was extended to September 2013, and later to September 2014. Contractors failed to meet deadlines, and the building was still not complete by the end of 2014. It was eventually completed in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Even as Metro officially {{designated}} Rosecroft Raceway as the Green Line's southern terminus, {{more than}} half of Prince George's County's representatives in the Maryland state legislature asked Governor Harry Hughes to review the proposed route after allegations of improper political pressure regarding the 1978 route decision surfaced. Metro officials proceeded anyway in March 1984 with Green Line design and planning, and moved the line's <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> up to late 1986.|$|E

5|$|The North Link {{project was}} {{approved}} by the Sound Transit Board in June 2012, setting a $2.1 billion budget and expected <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> of 2021. The contract for tunneling and station construction was awarded to JCM Northlink LLC (a joint venture of Jay Dee, Coluccio, and Michels) for $462 million in 2013. The majority of design work for Roosevelt station was completed in 2014 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|The pagoda {{was then}} {{completed}} {{by his son}} King Kyansittha (r.1084–1113). While its lower terraces were built by Anawrahta, the balance structure is credited to Kyansittha. Its final <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> is 1086 and the footprints below the four standing Buddha statues here are also believed {{to be of the}} same period. The pagoda is a replica of the pyramidal Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, the location of Buddha’s illuminating realisation in India.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{scheduled}} to be completed by May 16, 2016, but the estimated <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> was pushed back to October 2016. In October 2016, concerns arose that the station might not open on time because workers had only installed 10 of the station's 13 escalators. However, the 86th Street station passed all required systems testing by December 18, 2016. The station opened on January 1, 2017.|$|E

5|$|There is {{presently}} one mosque, the Central Reading Mosque on Waylen Street. The £3–4m Abu Bakr Islamic Centre, on Oxford Road in West Reading, was granted planning permission in 2002. The community-funded project began construction in 2006, but, as of July 2008, had no estimated <b>completion</b> <b>date.</b> A second Islamic centre in eastern Reading {{has also been}} granted planning permission. This £4m project has garnered some controversy.|$|E
5|$|A railway line {{existed before}} the war, {{but the last}} {{remnants}} of the line were dismantled in 1959. A rail project was announced in 2008 to be {{in line with the}} transport needs of SCORE, but as yet no construction work has begun despite an anticipated <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> in 2015. In 2017, the Sarawak government proposed a light rail system (Kuching Line) connecting Kuching, Samarahan and Serian divisions with anticipated completion in 2020. Currently, buses are the primary mode of public transportation in Sarawak with interstate services connecting the state to Sabah, Brunei, and Pontianak (Indonesia).|$|E
5|$|Due to cost increases, several {{features}} of the subway were cut back soon after construction started. Notably, the 72nd Street Station was truncated from a three-track, two-platform design to a two-track, single island platform design, paired with a simplification of the connection to the Broadway Line spur. This design change was done before the actual construction started. The MTA also pushed back its <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> to 2014. In its 2008 capital improvement budget proposal, the MTA further postponed completion of Phase 1 to 2015, and in 2009, the MTA rescheduled it again to 2016.|$|E

5|$|In July 2015, {{construction}} was delayed as contracts {{were still being}} finalised, and the <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> was moved to during the 2016–17 season. Construction was delayed again a month later, with work to begin in February or March 2016, for completion in April or May 2017. With construction costs increasing due to more detailed design work, construction inflation and delays, the council pledged an additional £7.2million in March 2016, raising {{the total cost of}} the project to £44.2million. Construction was delayed to the summer of 2016, for completion in early 2018.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania {{was laid}} down on 27 October 1913, with goals of {{fourteen}} months until launch, and thirty-two until completion. The as-yet unnamed Arizona was laid {{down on the}} morning of 16 March 1914 with Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Delano Roosevelt in attendance, and the builders intended to set a world-record ten months between keel-laying and launch, These ambitious goals—Pennsylvanias anticipated <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> was a full two months earlier than the American record—were set by Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, who wanted the United States to compete with British and German building achievements.|$|E
5|$|The Ballcourt is {{immediately}} {{north of the}} Court of the Hieroglyphic Stairway and is {{to the south of}} the Monument Plaza. It was remodeled by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, who then demolished it and built a third version, {{which was one of the}} largest from the Classic period. It was dedicated to the great macaw deity and the buildings flanking the playing area carried 16 mosaic sculptures of the birds. The <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> of the ballcourt is inscribed with a hieroglyphic text upon the sloping playing area and is given as 6January 738.|$|E

5|$|The {{sculpture}} {{was constructed}} in Sheffield by Thomas Heatherwick Studio, Packman Lucas, Flint and Neill and Westbury Structures. It was approved {{at the start of}} 2003, with the central core arriving in Manchester on 13 June 2004. This was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory, and required a police escort. This central core was lifted into place in August 2004, after which the 180 spikes could begin being attached. Early estimates had given an optimistic <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> of July 2003, which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname G of the Bang.|$|E
5|$|Construction on {{the second}} {{platform}}, an island platform connected via a pedestrian overpass, began in January 2014 with the closure of Mukilteo Lane near the station. Part of the existing North Platform was closed {{for use as a}} staging area in March 2014, expanding and contracting before and after rush hour, respectively. The $11 million project, designed by AECOM and HNTB in 2012, was originally scheduled to be completed in 2015. Delays in construction, including state approval of the new elevators, pushed back the <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> to April 2016. As part of the STart program, a percentage of construction funds went towards installing art made by Whidbey Island resident Linda Beaumont at the station.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 and 2009, {{the project}} met with delays {{to work on}} tramway infrastructure. Phase 1b {{of the project was}} {{cancelled}} because of a funding shortfall in April 2009. Contractual disputes delayed track-laying in the city centre. In December 2009, media reported that the project budget was running over £545 million, and the system was unlikely to come into operation until February 2012 or later. The operating contract with Transdev was cancelled in December 2009 to reduce costs and it was announced that the trams would be operated by Edinburgh Trams Limited, a subsidiary of Transport for Edinburgh. In March 2010, Bilfinger Berger announced that the estimated <b>completion</b> <b>date</b> would be in 2014.|$|E
