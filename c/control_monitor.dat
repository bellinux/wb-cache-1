40|$|Abstract. Regulation {{based on}} Continuous <b>Control</b> <b>Monitoring</b> {{could reduce the}} {{administrative}} burden for companies. Often, companies already have elaborate internal control and quality management systems. Instead of periodic physical inspections, regulatory supervision can partly be automated and performed on a continuous basis. The regulator gets access to a validated copy of key data elements from the company‟s internal information systems, which serve as indicator of compliance to specific control objectives. In this paper we describe an information architecture for continuous <b>control</b> <b>monitoring,</b> and show {{how it can be}} applied to supervision of regulatory compliance. The approach is illustrated by a pilot project in the Netherlands of applying continuous <b>control</b> <b>monitoring</b> to food safety regulations in the meat processing industry. Participants concluded that the approach is technically feasible but requires a different mindset towards regulation, and a clear business case...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{analyze the}} {{potential}} benefits that firms can realize from implementing technology specifically aimed at monitoring {{the effectiveness of their}} internal control systems. The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission asserts that effective internal <b>control</b> <b>monitoring</b> should enhance the efficiency of internal control processes, and in turn, the assurance over such processes (COSO 2009 a). We develop hypotheses to test the realization of these potential benefits. Specifically, we identify a sample of firms that implemented internal <b>control</b> <b>monitoring</b> technology in response to the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Consistent with our hypotheses, we document that the implementation of internal <b>control</b> <b>monitoring</b> technology is associated with lower likelihood of material weaknesses, smaller increases in audit fees, and smaller increases in audit delays during the post-SOX time period. We discuss the potential implications of our findings for research related to continuous monitoring, client-provide...|$|R
