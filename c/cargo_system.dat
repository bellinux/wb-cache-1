5|$|In practice, the {{flexibility}} which the OBO design allows has gone largely unused, as these ships tend {{to specialize in}} either the liquid or dry bulk trade. Also, these ships have endemic maintenance problems. On one hand, due to a less specialized design, an OBO suffers more from wear and tear during dry cargo onload than a bulker. On the other hand, components of the liquid <b>cargo</b> <b>system,</b> from pumps to valves to piping, tend to develop problems when subjected to periods of disuse.

The internal cargo handling system {{has been designed to}} facilitate cargo loading, sorting, and unloading in a more innovative and efficient manner, overcoming pre-deployment requirements for ground handling cargo equipment in austere environments. The system affixes containers and cargo pallets to rails in the fuselage ceiling, rather than on the floor; adjusts cargo positioning to accommodate changes in center of gravity, such as when other cargo is loaded and unloaded; facilitates access to any piece of cargo at any time, eliminating unneeded cargo movements and reducing ground time; and eliminates labor costs with traditional cargo handling and weight-and-balance requirements.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of offshore loading and discharge are the relative horizontal motions between the HTV and its cargo which must be controlled, to ensure safe and reliable operations. Optimization of the <b>cargo</b> handling <b>system</b> is needed to control the relative horizontal motions. This study investigates whether the mooring device ShoreTension will minimize the relative horizontal motions between a HTV and a cargo, when it is used as the <b>cargo</b> handling <b>system</b> during offshore loading and discharge operations. A MATLAB function of ShoreTension is developed, which is implemented into AQWA to predict the relative horizontal motions between the HTV and the cargo in time. Multiple simulations have been performed, {{each with its own}} <b>cargo</b> handling <b>system.</b> A simplified MATLAB mass-spring-ShoreTension model resembling the HTV and the cargo is set up to determine why and when ShoreTension reduces motions. A <b>cargo</b> handling <b>system</b> including ShoreTension cannot reduce the high-, wave-frequent relative horizontal motions occurring between the HTV and the cargo, as they are induced by an excitation frequency far beyond the natural frequency of the original <b>system.</b> Furthermore, a <b>cargo</b> handling <b>system</b> including ShoreTension should be able to lower the low-frequent relative horizontal motions, which are the result of resonance; by increasing the stiffness and by adding damping through giving out and heaving in the mooring line. The optimal configuration has not yet been found. It is recommended to further investigate in how ShoreTension should be outfitted as <b>cargo</b> handling <b>system</b> such that the low-frequent relative horizontal motions are minimized.
