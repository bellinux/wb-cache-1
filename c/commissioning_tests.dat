40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{validation of the}} surge modeling results as well as lessons learnt from the <b>commissioning</b> <b>test</b> of the Shuweihat Water Transmission Scheme in the UAE. The Scheme is divided in two systems, The first system (Lot A) transmits water from Shuweihat to Mirfa (100 km). The second (Lot C) is from Mirfa to Mussafah (150 km). The focus {{of this paper is}} on the model predictions and field data recorded by the SCADA system during full pump trip and valve closure events. The validation was performed during the <b>commissioning</b> <b>test</b> and showed a perfect match between the prediction and measurement of pressure and flow of the first wave. This paper also intends to highlight lessons learnt during the <b>commissioning</b> <b>test</b> and in particular the major risk that is caused by inaccurate manufacturer data. On {{the first day of the}} <b>commissioning</b> <b>test,</b> a near incident took place where the pressure during valve closure unexpectedly exceeded the pressure rating by 16 %. Damage to the pipeline was avoided by pressing the emergency trip push-button of the pumps thereby preventing the pipeline from being exposed to the full pressure rise. The post-incident investigation revealed that the control valve characteristics provided and certified by the manufacturer were inaccurate. A difference in Kv of up to 20 % was measured for valve positions below 40 % open and the valves were fully closed at 5 % opening. The control valve characteristics were recalibrated on site and the valve closure pattern was adapted. The <b>commissioning</b> <b>test</b> was resumed and completed flawlessly.

50|$|The {{inclined}} plane was more problematical. Green {{seems to have}} made an error in calculation, {{which resulted in the}} buckets being much too small. On the Bude Canal, he had used a 15-ton bucket to raise a five-ton boat. Here he had designed a 10-ton bucket, and the loaded boats weighed about 8 tons. <b>Commissioning</b> <b>tests</b> indicated that a bucket capable of holding 25 tons of water would be needed, but the shafts were not big enough. The novel power source had to be abandoned, {{to be replaced by a}} steam engine. Green was dismissed in January 1836.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{progress}} with the testing programme was slow, because line capacity on the finished test {{section of the}} Gyeongbu HSR was limited due to the priority of the <b>commissioning</b> <b>tests</b> of the KTX-I trains. [...] After the launch of regular service on April 1, 2004, the Korea Rail Network Authority allowed test runs only in the night hours {{when there was no}} regular service on the line. [...] The programme was also marred by technical problems, including a slip control problem which led to wheel abrasion, burned motor blocks, signalling troubles, braking system problems, and power car roll which led to the replacement of the suspension system. [...] After test runs focusing on reliability, 310 km/h was passed on May 6, 2004, 324 km/h was reached on June 29, 2004.|$|E

50|$|On 14 November 2015, a {{specialized}} TGV EuroDuplex was performing <b>commissioning</b> <b>tests</b> on the unopened {{second phase of}} the LGV Est high-speed line, when it entered a curve, overturned, and struck the parapet of a bridge over the Marne-Rhine Canal. The rear power car came to a rest in the canal, while the remainder of the train came to a rest in the grassy median between the northern and southern tracks. Approximately 50 people were on board, consisting of SNCF technicians and, reportedly, some unauthorized guests. Eleven were killed and 37 were injured. The train was performing tests at 10 percent above the planned speed limit for the line and should have slowed from 352 km/h to 176 km/h before entering the curve. Officials have indicated that excessive speed may have caused the accident. During testing some safety features that usually prevent accidents like this one are switched off.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} time, in early February 2014, {{the body of}} the motor car trains for the future was {{presented}} at the plant in Altenrhein. In August 2014, the plant produced the first six-car train ESh2-001, which was soon sent on the ferry to Klaipeda. In October 2014, the train arrived in Minsk for acceptance, <b>commissioning</b> <b>tests.</b> In November, its presentation took place in Moscow's Ilyich Train Depot; soon the second train arrived. Both trains were painted red with black bands {{at the level of the}} windows.Later, due to lack of funds caused by the decline of the ruble against the euro, Aeroexpress has further delayed the purchase of new electric trains. As a result of this funding crisis, the delivery of the first two trains manufactured in Belarus has never been carried out, and the third train was taken on the ferry to Lithuania and finally sent to Fanipol in April 2015.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{experimental}} {{observations on}} a set of twenty 700 [*]MW hydrogenerators, compiled from several technical reports issued over the last three decades and collected from the reprocessing of the vibration signals recorded during the last <b>commissioning</b> <b>tests,</b> this paper shows that the accurate determination of the journal bearings operating conditions may be a difficult task. It shows that the outsize bearing brackets of large hydrogenerators are subject to substantial dimensional changes caused by external agents, like the generator electromagnetic field and the bearing cooling water temperature. It also shows that the shaft eccentricity of a journal bearing of a healthy large hydrogenerator, operating in steady-state condition, may experience unpredictable, sudden, and significant changes without apparent reasons. Some of these phenomena are reproduced in ordinary <b>commissioning</b> <b>tests</b> or may be noticed even during normal operation, while others are rarely observed or are only detected through special tests. These phenomena modify journal bearings stiffness and damping, changing the hydrogenerator dynamics, creating discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements, and making damage detection and diagnostics difficult. Therefore, these phenomena must be analyzed and considered in the application of vibration-based condition monitoring to these rotating machines...|$|E
