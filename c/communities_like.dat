However, Jersey does not appear on the list of European States and Territories outside the Union and the Communities prepared by the European Council and the Commission.

25|$|In other words, {{according}} to Rousseau, reason, language and rational community did not arise {{because of any}} conscious decision or plan by humans or gods, nor because of any pre-existing human nature. As a result, he claimed, living together in rationally organized <b>communities</b> <b>like</b> modern humans is a development with many negative aspects compared to the original state of man as an ape. If anything is specifically human in this theory, it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans. This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} gold rushes {{in various parts}} of the {{province}} followed, the largest being the Cariboo Gold Rush in 1862, forcing the colonial administration into deeper debt as it struggled to meet the extensive infrastructure needs of far-flung boom <b>communities</b> <b>like</b> Barkerville and Lillooet, which sprang up overnight. The Vancouver Island colony was facing financial crises of its own, and pressure to merge the two eventually succeeded in 1866, when the colony of British Columbia was amalgamated with the Colony of Vancouver Island to form the Colony of British Columbia (1866–71), which was, in turn, succeeded by the present day province of British Columbia following the Canadian Confederation of 1871.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the nbsp&million inhabitants of the Czech Republic are ethnically and linguistically Czech (95%). They are descendants of Slavic people from the Black Sea-Carpathian region who settled in Bohemia, Moravia and parts of present-day Austria in the 6th century AD. Other ethnic groups include Germans, Romani, Poles and Hungarians. Historical minorities like Germans and Poles are declining due to assimilation. The Roma community is growing, while {{there is also a}} growing Vietnamese community.

By 1923 {{the party had}} raised over $64,000 for the Russian Red Cross, a very large sum of money at that time. It also initiated a Canadian component of the Trade Union Educational League (TUEL) which quickly became an organic part of the labour movement with active groups in 16 of 60 labour councils and in mining and logging camps. By 1925 party membership stood at around 4,500 people, composed mainly of miners and lumber workers, and of railway, farm, and garment workers. Most of these people came from immigrant <b>communities</b> <b>like</b> Finns and Ukrainians.|$|E
25|$|B’laan tribe is {{probably}} the most popular Mindanao occupants of Mountain provinces for Hanging Coffins of Sagada. Even before the influence of Christianity, the elders feared being buried on the ground, since they wanted to reach heaven in their afterlife. Out of love and concern, the family would hang the coffins {{on the wall of the}} cave (such as Lumiang cave). However, this kind of burial procedure was similar to other fishing <b>communities</b> <b>like</b> Banton of Romblon. Another unique characteristic of this pre-colonial burial custom contains the tradition of inserting jars in the coffin. This was similar to the Manunggul jar discovered in Tabon cave, Palawan, making the custom pre-existing even before the pre-colonial era. For B’laan people, tree served as a zone of final rest, which is a unique pattern for most of the Mindanao tribes’ burial custom as well.|$|E

25|$|Dhimmis were {{subjected}} {{to a number of}} restrictions, the application and severity of which varied with time and place. Restrictions included residency in segregated quarters, obligation to wear distinctive clothing, public subservience to Muslims, prohibitions against proselytizing and against marrying Muslim women, and limited access to the legal system (the testimony of a Jew did not count if contradicted by that of a Muslim). Dhimmis had to pay a special poll tax (the jizya), which exempted them from military service, and also from payment of the zakat alms tax required of Muslims. In return, dhimmis were granted limited rights, including a degree of tolerance, community autonomy in personal matters, and protection from being killed outright. Jewish <b>communities,</b> <b>like</b> Christian ones, were typically constituted as semi-autonomous entities managed by their own laws and leadership, who carried the responsibility for the community towards the Muslim rulers.|$|E
25|$|The 1870s {{brought an}} end to the bison {{presence}} in the Red River area. Métis <b>communities</b> <b>like</b> those at Red River or Turtle Mountain were forced to relocate to Canada and Montana. An area of resettlement was the Judith Basin in Montana, which still had a population of bison surviving in the early 1880s. By the end of decade, however, the bison were gone and Métis hunters relocated back to tribal lands. They wanted to take part in treaty negotiations in the 1880s, but they had questionable status with tribes such as the Chippewa. Many former Métis bison hunters tried to get land claims during the treaty negotiations in 1879-1880. They were reduced to squatting on Indian land during this time and collecting bison bones for $15–20 a ton in order to purchase supplies for the winter. The reservation system did not ensure that the Métis were protected and accepted as Indians. To further complicate matters, Métis had a questionable status as citizens and were often deemed incompetent to give court testimonies and denied the right to vote. The end of the bison robe trade {{was the end of the}} fur trade for many Métis. This meant that they had to reestablish their identity and adapt to a new economic world.|$|E
25|$|Ruth and Ellsworth Blackwell {{are noted}} as pioneers {{starting}} around 1940. By 1941 three converts to the religion include Mr. and Mrs. McBean and Muriel Johnson, a Jamaican couple and niece.

The Blackwells left by July 1943 though the community continued functioning. Word is received of two converts, Royer Dejean and Andre Paul, by January 1944. In 1943 writer and Bahá'í Alain Locke was on leave as Inter-American exchange Professor to Haiti under the joint auspices of the American Committee for Inter-American Artistic and Intellectual Relations and the Haitian Ministry of Education. Towards {{the end of his}} stay there, President Élie Lescot personally decorated Locke with the National Order of Honour and Merit, grade of Commandeur. In March 1946 Dr. Malcolm King moved to Haiti. By August there were some 20 Bahá'ís in Port-au-Prince and the assembly was able to register with the national government. King moved away in 1947 while other pioneers move to Haiti. In early 1948 a Latin American Congress was called in Mexico to coordinate institutional growth across the region and the delegate from Haiti was Martial Coulange. In late 1948 Gayle Woolson and early 1949 Louise Caswell each were able to travel through Haiti <b>communities</b> <b>like</b> Saint Marc and elsewhere and gave public talks.|$|E
