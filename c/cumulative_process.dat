500|$|In 1898, Knut Wicksell {{proposed}} a monetary theory centered on interest rates. His analysis used two rates: the market interest rate, {{determined by the}} banking system, and the real or [...] "natural" [...] interest rate, determined by the {{rate of return on}} capital. In Wicksell's theory, cumulative inflation will occur when technical innovation causes the natural rate to rise or when the banking system allows the market rate to fall. Cumulative deflation occurs under the opposite conditions causing the market rate to rise above the natural. Wicksell's theory did not produce a direct relationship between the quantity of money and price level. According to Wicksell, money would be created endogenously, without an increase in quantity of hard currency, as long as the natural exceeded the market interest rate [...] In these conditions, borrowers turn a profit and deposit cash into bank reserves, which expands money supply. This can lead to a <b>cumulative</b> <b>process</b> where inflation increases continuously without an expansion in the monetary base. Wicksell's work influenced Keynes and the Swedish economists of the Stockholm School.|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the Millennium Development Goals, the focus on {{vulnerability}} and access to care has increasingly gained ground in the malaria social science literature. However, little emphasis has been given to the <b>cumulative</b> <b>processes</b> of vulnerability. In this article, we draw on ethnographic data, in particular on case studies, gathered in southeastern Tanzania in the 1990 s and reexamine them in the context of vulnerability. We analyze the underpinnings of the cumulative dimension of vulnerability at three levels: (1) structural, that is, elements that determine access to material and social resources; (2) agent driven, that is, the consequences of coping strategies that enhance vulnerability; and (3) conjunctural, that is, periods characterized by the confluence of adverse circumstances.

R.. Wallace so strongly maintains, is a question which science has not yet answered satisfactorily. The tendency to or habit of varying in the direction of rich colouring and beautiful or fantastic ornament, might, for all we know to the contrary, have descended to humming-birds from some diminutive, curiously-shaped, bright-tinted, flying reptile of arboreal habits that lived in some far-off epoch in the world's history. It is not, at all events, maintained by anyone that all birds sprang originally from one reptilian stock; and the true position of humming-birds in a natural classification has not yet been settled, for no intermediate forms exist connecting them with any other group, To the ordinary mind they appear utterly unlike all other feathered creatures, and as much entitled to stand apart as, for instance, the pigeon and ostrich families. It has been maintained by some writers that they are anatomically related to the swifts, although the differences separating the two families appear so great as almost to stagger belief in this notion. Now, however, the very latest authority on this subject, Dr. Schufeldt, has {{come to the conclusion that}} swifts are only greatly modified Passeres, and that the humming-birds should form an order by themselves.|$|E
60|$|Students {{of nature}} are {{familiar}} with the modifying effects of new conditions on man and brute. Take, for example, the gaucho: he must every day traverse vast distances, see quickly, judge rapidly, be ready at all times to encounter hunger and fatigue, violent changes of temperature, great and sudden perils. These conditions have made him differ widely from the peasant of the Peninsula; he has the endurance and keen sight of a wolf, is fertile in expedients, quick in action, values human life not at all, and is in pain or defeat a Stoic. Unquestionably the horse he rides has also suffered a great change. He differs as much from the English hunter, for instance, as one animal can well differ from another of the same species. He never pounds the earth and wastes his energies in vain parade. He has not the dauntless courage that performs such brilliant feats in the field, and that often as not attempts the impossible. In the chase he husbands all his strength, carrying his head low, and almost grazing the ground with his hoofs, so that he is not a showy animal. Constant use, or the slow <b>cumulative</b> <b>process</b> of natural selection, has served to develop a keenness of sense almost preternatural. The vulture's eye, with all the advantage derived from the vulture's vast elevation above the scene surveyed, is not so far-reaching as the sense of smell in the pampa horse. A common phenomenon on the pampas is a sudden migration of the horses of a district to some distant place. This occurs in seasons of drought, when grass or water fails. The horses migrate to some district where, from showers having fallen or other circumstances, there is a better supply of food and drink. A slight breeze blowing from the more favoured region, which may be forty or fifty miles away, or even much further, is enough to start them off. Yet, during the scorching days of midsummer, very little moisture or smell of grass can possibly reach them from such a distance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{establish}} functional central limit theorems (FCLTs) for a <b>cumulative</b> input <b>process</b> to a fluid queue {{from the}} superposition of independent on-off sources, where the on periods and off periods may have heavy-tailed probability distributions. Variants of these FCLTs hold for cumulative busy time and idle time processes associated with standard queueing models. The heavy-tailed on-period and off-period distributions {{can cause the}} limit process to have discontinuous sample paths, e. g., to be a non-Brownian stable process or more general L'evy process, even though the converging processes have continuous sample paths. Consequently, we exploit the Skorohod M 1 topology on the function space D of right-continuous functions with left limits. The limits here combined with the previously established continuity of the reflection map in the M 1 topology implies both heavy-traffic and non-heavy-traffic FCLTs for buffer-content processes in stochastic fluid networks.
