40|$|Abstract: This paper {{illuminates}} a {{new type}} of precision cropping process method with rotary striking action. The new process makes use of a controllable circumferential strike on a metal bar with a V-shaped notch. The working principle of the machine is described. Different types of metal bars have been tested, and both bad results and successful results were stated in the paper. The most ideal control mode has been obtained. The experimental results show that the new cropping process can <b>crop</b> <b>bars</b> with different materials and diameters. In some cases, it can be directly used in the subsequent industrial production...|$|R

40|$|Agriculture in India {{occupies}} {{an important}} place as it contributes nearly 25 per cent of GDP and {{two-thirds of the}} population depend upon it. Agricultural growth {{in the past has}} been sufficient to move from severe food crisis to aggregate food surplus today. The rainfed regions are diverse in terms of resource base, varying from resource rich regions harnessing substantial production to resource poor regions with restricted potential. These resource poor regions are mostly dominated by secondary <b>crops.</b> <b>Barring</b> maize and potato, secondary crops are loosing ground against the finer cereals, cash and commercial crops. Therefore, there is an urgent need to provide a leverage to these crops by providing support in terms of technological advancement and policy support vis-à-vis other crops. The present study is an attempt to provide some much needed succor to secondary crops, thereby supporting millions of livelihoods inhabiting the rainfed marginal environments of the country. diversification, food crops, agriculture, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R

50|$|Ottoman {{alignment}} with the Central Powers during World War I caused the Entente Powers to block international trade routes {{in an effort}} to stop the supplies to the Ottomans. The blockade damaged Mount Lebanon's silk trade, a backbone of the economy. Growing crops was already a challenge in the mountainous range and the inhabitants heavily relied on food imports from the adjacent Bekaa Valley and Syria. To counter the Allied blockade, the Ottomans adopted a severe policy of acquisition by which all foodstuffs were prioritized for the Ottoman soldiers engaged in the war. The Allies' blockade was made worse by another introduced by Jamal Pasha, the commander of the Fourth Army of the Ottoman Empire in Syria region, where <b>crops</b> were <b>barred</b> from entering from the neighboring Syrian hinterland to Mount Lebanon, and by the arrival of a swarm of locusts to the region in 1915 that, for three continuous months, devoured the remaining crops. The crisis further exacerbated a black market run by well-connected usurers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Crop {{evapotranspiration}} (ETc) estimation {{is essential}} for many studies such as hydrologic water balance, irrigation system design and management, crop yield simulation, and water resources planning and management. The interdependence {{of most of the}} factors affecting ETc and, their spatial and temporal variability make it difficult to formulate an equation {{that can be used to}} estimate ETc for different crops under different climatic conditions. The present study derived average weekly crop coefficient (Kc) values for groundnut, paddy, tobacco and sugarcane crops commonly grown in Tirupati, Nellore, Rajahmundry and Anakapalli regions of Andhra Pradesh, India respectively and compared them with those computed based on the procedure recommended in FAO 56. The Kc curve fitted to follow the trend similar to that recommended in FAO 56, significantly deviated for most of the crops in the regions at different stages of <b>crop</b> growth, <b>barring</b> a few exceptions. A third order polynomial Kc models for different crops in the regions have therefore been developed for use in the weekly ETc estimation. It has also been observed that ETc values computed based on Kc values estimated using the models proposed are comparable with those of lysimeter measured ETc.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a selection of}} numerical and theoretical results of the cross wedge rolling process for producing stepped shafts made of aluminum alloy 6061. The numerical modeling was performed using the FEM-based Simufact Forming simulation software. In the simulations, we examined the kinematics of metal flow and determined the distribution patterns of effective strains, temperatures, axial stresses and the Cockroft-Latham damage criterion. Variations in the rolling forces were determined, too. The numerical results were verified experimentally using a universal rolling mill designed and constructed by the present authors. This machine {{can be used to}} perform such processes as cross wedge rolling, longitudinal rolling and round <b>bar</b> <b>cropping.</b> During the experiments, we examined process stability and finished product geometry and recorded the torques. The experimental results confirm that axisymmetric aluminum alloy shafts can be produced by cross wedge rolling with two rolls. Last but not least, the experiments served to evaluate the technological potential of the rolling mill used...|$|R

(some col.) This research investigated bearing failures in {{a spur gear}} cutter bar used in the agricultural equipment sector for cutting forage <b>crops.</b> The cutter <b>bar</b> is under consideration by Case-New Holland (CNH) for use in their equipment. The primary focus {{of this investigation was}} to develop and test a real time monitoring system to monitor the health of the bearings during operation and alert the operator of the location of a pending bearing failure. This system uses temperature as the monitoring parameter and does not estimate the remaining useful life after the initial failure mode has been detected. The temperature profile of interest is that just before catastrophic failure and based on that is used to alert the operator. Causes of bearing failure within the cutter bar are also investigated theoretically to determine the effect that they would have on bearing life. Both cutter bar bending and bearing misalignment were analyzed from a theoretical perspective. Bending of the cutter bar was determined to not have a detrimental effect on the contact stresses within the bearings and thus no shortening of bearing life. Bearing alignment is a critical factor in bearing condition as excessive misalignment creates high contact stresses reducing the useful life. The gear train and bearings are retained between two steel halves creating a case, and to prevent excessive misalignment the case halves cannot shift by more than 0. 47 ± 0. 04 mm relative to the vertical axis of each bearing mount. Additional testing determined that operating the cutter bar on a hill has no effect on bearing life and that oil temperature can be used to monitor the correct amount of oil in the cutter bar...|$|R
