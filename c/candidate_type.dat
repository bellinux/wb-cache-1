This paper develops a mechanism design model to investigate the effect of such information asymmetry on the kidney allocation system. In this model, there are n transplant queues corresponding to n <b>candidate</b> <b>types.</b> <b>Candidate</b> <b>types</b> are only observed by the candidates, and each candidate chooses the queue to join by reporting a type. Kidneys have heterogeneous types, and each kidney will be {{assigned to one of}} the queues depending on its <b>type.</b> <b>Candidates</b> report their <b>type</b> strategically to join the queue that maximizes their utility. Candidate utility depends on the type of kidney received and the expected waiting time, which is calculated using fluid approximations. We consider two alternative social welfare functions: aggregate utility (emphasizing efficiency) and minimum utility across all candidates (emphasizing equity). The kidney allocation problem is to divide the organ supply among the different queues so that social welfare is maximized, and this problem is solved explicitly under both objective functions. There are three findings: (1) The allocation mechanism induces truth telling by ensuring that candidates who wait longer receive better kidneys; (2) Information rents are earned by high-risk candidates under the efficiency objective and by low-risk candidates under the equity objective; (3) a choice-based kidney allocation system in which <b>candidates</b> choose the <b>type</b> of queue to join leads to outcomes {{in the middle of the}} efficiency-equity spectrum. kidney allocation, efficiency-equity trade-off, mechanism design, hidden information, achievable regions, fluid queues...|$|R

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{research}} in abstract model checking, {{we present a}} new approach to inferring dependent types. Unlike many of the existing approaches, our approach does not rely on programmers to supply the candidate (or the correct) types for the recursive functions and instead does counterexample-guided refinement to automatically generate the set of <b>candidate</b> dependent <b>types.</b> The main idea is to extend the classical fixed-point type inference routine to return a counterexample if the program is found untypable with the current set of <b>candidate</b> <b>types.</b> Then, an interpolating theorem prover is used to validate the counterexample as a real type error or generate additional <b>candidate</b> dependent <b>types</b> to refute the spurious counterexample. The process is repeated until either a real type error is found or sufficient candidates are generated to prove the program typable. Our system makes non-trivial use of “linear” intersection types in the refinement phase.

The implementation infers dependent types containing predicates from the quantifierfree theory of linear arithmetic and equality with uninterpreted function symbols.

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a language-independent, {{unsupervised}} approach to sentence boundary detection. It {{is based on the}} assumption that a large number of ambiguities in the determination of sentence boundaries can be eliminated once abbreviations have been identified. Instead of relying on orthographic clues, as is usually done, the proposed system is able to detect abbreviations with high accuracy using three criteria that only require information about the <b>candidate</b> <b>type</b> itself and are independent of context: Abbreviations can be defined as a very tight collocation consisting of a truncated word and a final period, abbreviations are usually short, and abbreviations sometimes contain internal periods. We also show the potential of collocational evidence for two other important subtasks of sentence boundary disambiguation, namely the detection of initials and ordinal numbers. The proposed system has been tested extensively on eleven different languages and on different text genres. It achieves good results without any further amendments or language-specific resources. We evaluate its performance against three different baselines and compare it to other systems for sentence boundary detection proposed in the literature. ...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the most}} recent QSO {{ultraviolet}} spectra, the covering factor of the clouds of the Broad Line Region (BLR) is about 30 %, or larger. This value would imply that in at least 30 % of the QSOs our line of sight crosses one, or more, BLR clouds and, in the latter case, the UV spectrum should show a sharp Ly-edge in absorption. This Ly-edge in absorption is never observed. This paradox is solved if, as suggested by various authors, the BLR is flattened and the dusty gas in the outer parts, on the same plane, prevents the observation {{along the lines of}} sight passing through the BLR clouds. The objects observed edge-on (with respect to the flattened BLR) would be classified as obscured QSOs or, {{within the framework of the}} unified model, type 2 QSOs.

U Sco is the first recurrent nova to be observed during a luminous supersoft X-ray phase. Non-LTE white dwarf atmosphere spectral models (together with a ~ 0. 5 keV optically thin thermal component) were fitted to the BeppoSAX spectrum. We find that the fit is acceptable assuming enriched He and an enhanced N/C ratio. This implies that the CNO cycle was active during the outburst, in agreement with a thermonuclear runaway scenario. The best-fit temperature is ~ 9 10 ^ 5 K and the bolometric luminosity those predicted for steady nuclear burning on a WD close to the Chandrasekhar mass. The fact that U~Sco was detected as a supersoft X-ray source is consistent with steady nuclear burning continuing for at least one month after the outburst.

However, this result hinges on an RS Oph distance of <~ 540 pc, in strong disagreement with the widely adopted distance of ~ 1. 6 kpc.

Two <b>candidate</b> <b>type</b> II NADH dehydrogenase genes with canonical GXGXXG motifs were identified in a draft genome sequence of B. pseudofirmus OF 4. The gene product designated NDH- 2 A exhibited homology to enzymes from Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli whereas NDH- 2 B exhibited homology to the H. dabanensis Nap protein and its alkaliphilic Bacillus halodurans C- 125 homologue.

The {{proportion}} of legislative seats held {{by women and}} minority groups in most countries rarely, if ever, equals the group’s {{proportion of}} the population. Most scholars agree disproportional seat distribution {{is caused by the}} skewed composition of candidate pools put forward by political parties during elections. Scholars disagree whether unrepresentative candidate pools are caused by too few candidates of a certain type coming forward to participate in the process (supply) or by party selectors preferring some <b>candidate</b> <b>types</b> to others (demand). This paper draws upon British Labour party data from the 2001, 2005, and 2010 General Elections to explore supply and demand during each of the seven stages of Labour’s candidate selection process. Tests performed on data from 4622 aspirant candidates reveal women, Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME), and disabled people are underrepresented in Labour’s candidate pools, which is caused by a lack of demand by local party selectors rather than an undersupply of these <b>candidate</b> <b>types.</b> Regression modelling of 44 variables drawn from survey data provided by 566 aspirant candidates more sharply focuses on the idea that party selectors prefer “ideal” <b>type</b> aspirant <b>candidates.</b> While these tests confirm a lack of central party selector preference toward the ideal type they confirm local party selector preference for aspirant candidates with certain ideal traits. Moreover, local party members {{are much more likely to}} select men over women in open, non-all women shortlist seats, which strongly suggests Labour retain or even expand guaranteed seats for women and perhaps initiate similar measures for disabled people. The same might be considered for BAME aspirant candidates, although it appears living locally is a much more important trait to local party selectors than race.
