40|$|Three {{experiments}} that used a latent inhibition procedure {{to investigate the}} effects of <b>ceronapril</b> on attentional processes in the rat are reported. Latent inhibition is a behavioural paradigm in which prior exposure to a stimulus with no significant consequences retards subsequent conditioning to that stimulus when it is paired with reinforcement. Latent inhibition reflects a process of learning to ignore, or tune out, irrelevant stimuli, and has been suggested as an animal model of the attentional processes disrupted in the acute phase of schizophrenia. In animals, latent inhibition is disrupted by the administration of low doses of amphetamine and enhanced by the administration of neuroleptics. <b>Ceronapril</b> is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor that {{has been shown to}} retard the breakdown of central cholecystokinin. It has been proposed that elevation of cholecystokinin levels in the brain may possess neuroleptic-like properties. We assessed this possibility by determining the effects of <b>ceronapril</b> on latent inhibition using a conditioned emotional response procedure, consisting of three stages: pre-exposure, in which the to-be-conditioned stimulus, a tone, was repeatedly presented without reinforcement; conditioning, in which the pre-exposed stimulus was paired with shock; and test, where latent inhibition was indexed by animals' suppression of licking during tone presentation. In Experiment 1, 20 tone pre-exposures were given, and conditioning consisted of five tone-shock pairings; we assessed the effects of 0. 005 mg/kg, 0. 05 mg/kg and 0. 5 mg/kg <b>ceronapril,</b> compared with vehicle injections. In Experiment 2, five tone pre-exposures were given, and conditioning consisted of two tone-shock pairings: we assessed the effects of 0. 05 mg/kg <b>ceronapril,</b> compared with vehicle injections.
