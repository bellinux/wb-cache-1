25|$|On October 17, 2017 Frank Ocean's dad, Calvin Cooksey, sued Frank {{on charges}} of {{defamation}} and other damages with restitution payments reaching up to 14.5 million dollars. The issue started when Frank Ocean wrote a post in his personal Tumblr responding to the Pulse Nightclub shooting back in June 2016 and told {{a story about how}} when he was a kid, he heard his father use a transphobic slur towards a waitress. The post stated that:'I was six years old when I heard my dad <b>call</b> <b>our</b> transgender waitress a f***** as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. 'That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist.' The judge ended up ruling in favor of Frank Ocean and the case was put to an end.|$|E
500|$|Originating as a skiffle group, the Beatles quickly embraced 1950s {{rock and}} roll and helped pioneer the Merseybeat genre, and their {{repertoire}} ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music. Reflecting the range of styles they explored, Lennon said of Beatles for Sale, [...] "You could <b>call</b> <b>our</b> new one a Beatles country-and-western LP", while Gould credits Rubber Soul as [...] "the instrument by which legions of folk-music enthusiasts were coaxed into the camp of pop".|$|E
500|$|In a 2004 plot, Dot was {{diagnosed}} with kidney cancer. The programme makers sought advice from health care professionals when devising the storyline, including specialist information nurses from CancerBACUP. Nurse Martin Ledwick said, [...] "We drew on our experience of talking {{to the thousands of}} people who <b>call</b> <b>our</b> helpline, to help advise the EastEnders scriptwriters. Many people react to a cancer diagnosis as Dot does in the BBC serial– with confusion and fear. We also speak to family and friends affected by the illness and those living with continuing uncertainty. EastEnders explores all these issues, and hopefully will help improve people's understanding of what it's like to be affected by a cancer diagnosis." ...|$|E

500|$|However, {{because of}} the devastation caused in Haiti, these plans were postponed. Phillips said that Jones had called Lionel and said, [...] "this is what this song is written for, as a {{fundraising}} vehicle for causes, tragedies, catastrophes like this. Why don't we take over the process, <b>call</b> <b>our</b> friends, and actually do this?" [...] Lionel understood the urgency of Haiti, and in January 2010, {{it was agreed that}} [...] "We Are the World" [...] would be re-recorded to help benefit Haiti, similar to how the original recording helped famine relief in Africa. Richie commented, [...] "Unfortunately, sometimes it takes a hit record to make someone decide to save a life. I want this song to be the battle cry again. Every once in a while, you have to wake the world up. We slept right through Katrina. If we are not a socially aware culture, we're going to fail." ...|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} to conceive of disconnected spacetimes, each existing but unable to interact with one another. An easily visualized metaphor {{is a group of}} separate soap bubbles, in which observers living on one soap bubble cannot interact with those on other soap bubbles, even in principle. According to one common terminology, each [...] "soap bubble" [...] of spacetime is denoted as a universe, whereas our particular spacetime is denoted as the Universe, just as we <b>call</b> <b>our</b> moon the Moon. The entire collection of these separate spacetimes is denoted as the multiverse. With this terminology, different Universes are not causally connected to each other. In principle, the other unconnected Universes may have different dimensionalities and topologies of spacetime, different forms of matter and energy, and different physical laws and physical constants, although such possibilities are purely speculative. Others consider each of several bubbles created as part of chaotic inflation to be separate Universes, though in this model these universes all share a causal origin.|$|E

At a Remembrance Day address in 1952, Treatt criticised radical student politics embodied by the [...] "long-haired intellectual types": [...] "My {{belief in the}} value of university life and in higher education generally is a strong and abiding one...the sort of long-haired type I am thinking about may not even have a university degree. He is encased in self satisfied assurance of his own mental superiority." [...] In his speech at the Lyceum Hall, Treatt warned of Australia's attitudes on its success: [...] "A sort of mental haze seems to obscure the vision splendid that lies before this country. We are proud of being a British country, a country with British traditions, institutions, and all those things which go to make up what we <b>call</b> <b>our</b> 'British heritage. But this pride is not matched by a pride in being Australian. This seems to me one of the strongest sources of our weakness." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{review by}} John Ferriar in the October 1805 Monthly Review argued, [...] "It {{has fallen to}} the lot of this writer to puzzle our {{critical}} discernment more than once [...] He has no contrived to manufacture a large quarto, which he has styled a poem, but of what description it is no easy matter to decide [...] The poem of Madoc is not didactic, nor elegiac, nor classical, in any respect [...] Respecting the manners, Mr. Southey {{appears to have been}} more successful than in his choice of the story. He has adhered to history where he could discover any facts adapted to his purpose; and when history failed him, he has had resource to probability." [...] Ferriar continued with an attack on the Welsh names that appear within the poem: [...] "we own that the nomenclature of his heroes has shocked what Mr. S. would <b>call</b> <b>our</b> prejudices. Georvyl and Rird and Rodri and Llaian may have charms for Cambrian ears, but who can feel an interest in Tezozomoc, Tlalala, or Ocelopan [...] how could we swallow Yuhidthiton, Coanocotzin, and, above all, the yawnings jaw-dislocating Ayayaca?—These torturing words, particularly the latter, remind us so strongly of the odious cacophony of the Nurse and Child, that they really are not to be tolerated." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 2010, TV Tonight {{reported}} that Neighbours would reduce crew operations in 2011 so production could be upgraded. The changes {{meant that the}} location manager and catering team were no longer required, studio shoots would be reduced from three cameras to two, and location shots will be mainly confined to the Ramsay Street and Lassiter's complex sets, with occasional filming in one-off places. Of the changes, FremantleMedia said [...] "Neighbours is undergoing a work flow upgrade to accommodate advances in technology and production techniques to ensure {{we are at the}} forefront of professionalism and efficiency." [...] They added that the show's production model had been in place since 1985 and {{that it was time to}} evolve it. On 14 March 2011, The Australian {{reported that}} Neighbours has become the first television show available to watch on a free iPhone application. Viewers are able to watch whole episodes within three hours of them airing on Eleven. Nick Spooner, the head of Ten digital media said [...] "This is part of what we <b>call</b> <b>our</b> 'three-screen approach' – broadcast, online and mobile – and it is intended to build viewer engagement with a show and our brand. This is a way for us to stay in touch with our audience and to keep them coming back." [...] To celebrate the wedding of Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton, Neighbours filmed a specially commissioned scene for the UK episode airing on the same day as the wedding. The episode, which had already aired in Australia, marked the first time an Australian show recorded extra scenes for a UK broadcaster.|$|E
500|$|... "The Only One" [...] was {{originally}} called [...] "Tuna Afternoon" [...] and lyrically delves on Lee's experiences with close-mindedness and {{people around her}} who seemed lost {{in a world in}} which they did not belong. It starts with a piano introduction similar to that of the band's Fallen era and songs by Sarah McLachlan. In the song, Lee [...] "decries human guidance" [...] with the chorus lines, [...] "All our lives / We've been waiting / For someone to <b>call</b> <b>our</b> leader / All your lies / I'm not believing / Heaven shine a light down on me". [...] "Your Star" [...] was motivated by Lee's loneliness during the band's tour in support of Fallen. She was inspired to write the chorus in Lisbon when she looked at the night sky and could see no stars. Other inspiration came from the works of [...] Pantera. Guitars and piano provide the track's instrumentation; while Lee sings about God according to Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone. [...] "All That I'm Living For" [...] was co-written by guitarist John LeCompt; it describes Lee's night-time writing process, which is showcased in the opening line, [...] "I can feel the night beginning / Separate me from the living". It contains [...] "power chords", elements of electronica, and abrasive guitars. [...] "Good Enough" [...] was solely written by Lee, and was placed at the end of the album for symbolizing its themes and those of the singer's life. While featuring a string section, it resembles Tori Amos' and Sarah McLachlan's songs. Inspired by her then-future husband Josh Hartzler, [...] "Good Enough" [...] has a similar composition to [...] "My Immortal" [...] because of their piano sounds.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Eric Yoffie, {{president}} of the Union for Reform Judaism, called J Street's reaction to the Israeli invasion of Gaza [...] "morally deficient, profoundly {{out of touch with}} Jewish sentiment and also appallingly naïve".

If our views are 'naive' and 'morally deficient', then so are the views of scores of Israeli journalists, security analysts, distinguished authors, and retired IDF officers who have posed the same questions about the Gaza attack as we have." [...] Despite this rebuttal, J Street subsequently invited Yoffie to its 2009 convention, and he subsequently praised the organization's stance on the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, which was closer to that of other American Jewish organizations.|$|E

2500|$|When Schopenhauer {{identifies}} the noumenon with the desires, needs, and impulses in {{us that we}} name [...] "will", {{what he is saying}} is that we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through will. We cannot prove that our mental picture of an outside world corresponds with a reality by reasoning; through will, we know—without thinking—that the world can stimulate us. We suffer fear, or desire: these states arise involuntarily; they arise prior to reflection; they arise even when the conscious mind would prefer to hold them at bay. The rational mind is, for Schopenhauer, a leaf borne along in a stream of pre-reflective and largely unconscious emotion. That stream is will, and through will, if not through logic, we can participate in the underlying reality beyond mere phenomena. It {{is for this reason that}} Schopenhauer {{identifies the}} noumenon with what we <b>call</b> <b>our</b> will.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Lennon {{said of the}} album: [...] "You could <b>call</b> <b>our</b> new one a Beatles {{country and}} western LP." [...] Music critic Tim Riley views the album as a [...] "country excursion", while MacDonald {{describes}} it as being [...] "dominated by the [...] idiom". The impetus for this new direction came partly from the band's exposure to US country radio stations while on tour; in addition, it was a genre that Ringo Starr had long championed. Lennon's [...] "I Don't Want to Spoil the Party" [...] was an early example of country rock, anticipating the Byrds' work in that style. [...] "I'm a Loser" [...] was the first Beatles song to directly reflect the influence of Bob Dylan, {{and served as a}} precursor to the folk-rock explosion of 1965. Author Jonathan Gould highlights the influence of blues and country-derived rockabilly in both the album's original compositions and the inclusion of songs by Carl Perkins and Buddy Holly; he also comments that Dylan's acoustic folk sound was a style that the Beatles tended to identify as country music. McCartney considered that Beatles for Sale introduced a more mature phase for the band, marking a progression whereby [...] "We got more and more free to get into ourselves. Our student selves rather than 'we must please the girls and make money' …" ...|$|E
