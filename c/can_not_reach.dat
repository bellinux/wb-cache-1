2500|$|On farms it is {{very common}} to use {{artificial}} insemination (AI)), [...] a medically assisted reproduction technique consisting of the artificial deposition of semen in the female's genital tract.

2500|$|Jewel spiders are facultatively gregarious. They {{can often}} be found living near each other in large {{overlapping}} aggregations of orb webs of usually thirty individuals. These can entirely blanket shrubs, tree branches, or man-made structures. A 1997 study observed that aggregations {{do not seem to}} increase the amount of prey caught, but it is believed that they still benefit the individual members in other ways. Once such advantage is foraging efficiency. By attaching their webs to neighbouring webs, jewel spiders do not need to produce as much silk as they would have when building solitary orb webs. The use of neighbouring webs for support may also allow them to build webs in prey-rich areas they normally <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> alone (such as the wide gaps between trees). Prey capture may further be enhanced by the creation of a [...] "ricochet effect", wherein prey that escapes one web, may be caught by a neighbouring web.|$|E
6000|$|The Carthaginian soldiers, {{following}} Hasdrubal's example, {{opened the}} gates of the citadel, and let the conqueror in. The deserters were now made absolutely desperate by their danger, and some of them, more furious than the rest, preferring to die by their own hands rather than to give their hated enemies the pleasure of killing them, set the building in which they were shut up in on fire. The miserable inmates ran to and fro, half suffocated by the smoke and scorched by the flames. Many of them reached the roof. Hasdrubal's wife and children were among the number. She looked down from this elevation, the volumes of smoke and flame rolling up around her, and saw her husband standing below with the Roman general--perhaps looking, in consternation, for his wife and children, amid this scene of horror. The sight of the husband and father in a position of safety made the wife and mother perfectly furious with resentment and anger. [...] "Wretch!" [...] she screamed, in a voice which raised itself above the universal din, [...] "is it thus you seek to save your own life while you sacrifice ours? I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>reach</b> you in your own person, but I kill you hereby in the persons of your children." [...] So saying, she stabbed her affrighted sons with a dagger, and hurled them down, struggling all the time against their insane mother's phrensy, into the nearest opening from which flames were ascending, and then leaped in after them herself to share their awful doom.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Effective pruning is {{essential}} for efficient iceberg cube computation. Previous {{studies have focused on}} exclusive pruning: regions of a search space that do not satisfy some condition are excluded from computation. In this paper we propose inclusive and anti-pruning. With inclusive pruning, necessary conditions that solutions must satisfy are identified and regions that <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be <b>reached</b> by such conditions are pruned from computation. With anti-pruning, regions of solutions are identified and pruning is not applied. We propose the multiway pruning strategy combining exclusive, inclusive and anti-pruning with bounding aggregate functions in iceberg cube computation. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that the multiway-pruning strategy improves the efficiency of iceberg cubing algorithms with only exclusive pruning. ...|$|R
