40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the development of the}} affirmative action issue since its inception, and compares its dynamics and evolution with the broader civil rights movement of the 1950 s and 1960 s. It identifies and discusses three periods or phases of the affirmative action regime. This vein of research helps provide at least a partial explanation for why policies in related areas of civil rights may produce different outcomes, and explicates the broad resistance to key elements of the anti-discrimination effort of the last three decades. A tentative model based on the congruence of the policy stance of political institutions to public opinion is suggested. We conclude that while issues such as affirmative action may be susceptible to long-run institutional <b>counter</b> <b>pressures,</b> voluntary programs to increase diversity will certainly continue.

40|$|The Ivory Coast's Taï Forest {{is home to}} {{a diverse}} primate fauna, {{including}} eight monkey species that interact daily with the environment, each other, and a web of predators. These interactions have led to an array of adaptations, some of which conform to theoretical expectations, and others are at odds with current behavioral ecology models. In this paper, we draw on fifteen years of observations to examine two central issues. First, how do broad trends in diet and resource distribution influence group size and levels of sociality? Second, what mechanisms are used to <b>counter</b> <b>pressures</b> exerted by the predator community? The general picture that emerges is that while the pressure exerted by predators at Taï has led to a host of behavioral and cognitive adaptations, it is food preferences and foraging habits, not predation pressure, that are the main determinants, not only of group size, but also its direct consequences - mating systems and sociality levels...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a model is {{developed}} {{to describe the}} three dimensional contact melting process of a cuboid on a heated surface.

In the solid an optimised heat balance integral method is used to approximate the temperature. In the liquid the small aspect ratio allows the Navier-Stokes and heat equations to be simplified considerably so that the liquid pressure may be determined using an igenfunction expansion and finally the problem is reduced to solving three first order ordinary differential equations. Results are presented showing the evolution of the melting process. Further reductions to the system are made to provide simple guidelines concerning the process. Comparison of the solutions with experimental data on the melting of n-octadecane shows excellent agreement...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} a new low-cost liquid dispenser for the dispensing of microliters to milliliter volumes. The dispensing mechanism {{is based on}} a thermal actuator where highly expandable microspheres expand into a liquid reservoir consequently displacing any stored liquid. All device components are made out of low-cost materials and the fabrication process has the potential for high volume batch manufacturing. The device utilizes the property of the expandable microspheres to form a heat insulating layer between the heat source and the delivered liquid. Moreover, it does not require any feed back or complicated flow metering. The device was successfully tested showing a mean dispensed volume of 101 mu 1 {{with a standard deviation of}} 3. 2 % and with a maximum temperature of 59 degrees C in the liquid during actuation. It was shown that the dispenser is strong enough to deliver against <b>counter</b> <b>pressures</b> as high as 75 kPa. The device can also function as a low flow rate dispenser as demonstrated in a microfluidic dye laser application. The flow rate can be controlled between 1 mu 1 h(- 1) and 2400 mu 1 h(- 1) by adjusting the actuation power. QC 20100623 </p...|$|R

5000|$|Fine {{blanking}} presses {{are similar}} to other metal stamping presses, {{but they have a}} few critical additional parts. A typical compound fine blanking press includes a hardened die punch (male), the hardened blanking die (female), and a guide plate of similar shape/size to the blanking die. The guide plate is the first applied to the material, impinging the material with a sharp protrusion or stinger {{around the perimeter of the}} die opening. Next a <b>counter</b> <b>pressure</b> is applied opposite the punch, and finally the die punch forces the material through the die opening. Since the guide plate holds the material so tightly, and since the <b>counter</b> <b>pressure</b> is applied, the material is cut in a manner more like extrusion than typical punching. Mechanical properties of the cut benefit similarly with a hardened layer at the cut edge of the part. [...] Because the material is so tightly held and controlled in this setup, part flatness remains very true, distortion is nearly eliminated, and edge burr is minimal. Clearances between the die and punch are generally around 1% of the cut material thickness, which typically varies between 0.5 - 13 mm. Currently parts as thick as 19 mm can be cut using fine blanking. Tolerances between ±0.0003 - 0.002 in are possible, depending on base material thickness and tensile strength, and part layout.|$|E
