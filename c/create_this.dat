5|$|The call or croak of a frog {{is unique}} to its species. Frogs <b>create</b> <b>this</b> sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified {{by one or more}} vocal sacs, {{membranes}} of skin under the throat or {{on the corner of the}} mouth, that distend during the amplification of the call. Some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile away.|$|E
5|$|An {{ironstone}} {{mine was}} opened {{to work on}} a rock outcrop in 1853. The mine was to supply flux for the Port Adelaide copper smelting works, but it apparently closed within a year. It was reopened in 1861 and operated until 1862. The Tea Tree Gully Silver Mining Company began work in the area in 1888, constructing a tramway, blacksmith shop and a new road. With no economic finds, the company closed in July 1889. The quarry, in Water Gully adjacent to the nursery's ruins, has been mined for blue dolomite, some of which was used for the nursery's buildings. Quarries elsewhere in Water Gully were opened in the 1880s and intermittently supplied quartzite road metal for the District Council of Tea Tree Gully. A crushing plant was erected {{on the north side of}} the gully in 1912 to <b>create</b> <b>this</b> road material.|$|E
5|$|The Ballroom, {{the last}} of the palace's three largest rooms, (illustrated below) was {{designed}} by Robillon in 1760. To <b>create</b> <b>this</b> oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms. The ormolu Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding to the walls and ceiling, of such richness that it has been compared with that of François de Cuvilliés' Amalienburg at Schloss Nymphenburg. The walls and doors are mirrored and the painted and gilded, coffered ceiling is supported by golden caryatids.|$|E

5|$|The act {{gave the}} new school {{an annual budget of}} £900 (around £75,000 in 2008) from the bequest while the {{governors}} of the City of London Corporation School, who still wanted to implement their original idea, gained nothing, only retaining the old workhouse income. Both Hale and the Corporation of London were also eager to <b>create</b> <b>this</b> second school, which the governors of the City of London Corporation School had proposed. Despite their efforts, the other school was not founded until 1854, as the Freemen's Orphanage School, in Brixton with Hale as chairman. The Freemen's Orphanage School still exists today as the City of London Freemen's School in Surrey.|$|E
5|$|Time is also {{connected}} {{to the theme of}} light and dark. In Shakespeare's day, plays were most often performed at noon or in the afternoon in broad daylight. This forced the playwright to use words to create the illusion of day and night in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to <b>create</b> <b>this</b> illusion. He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to the illusion of its passage.|$|E
5|$|While most early ornithologists defended Bartram's honesty, Joel Asaph Allen {{argued that}} the painted vulture was mythical and that Bartram mixed {{elements}} of different species to <b>create</b> <b>this</b> bird. Allen {{pointed out that the}} birds' behavior, as recorded by Bartram, is in complete agreement with the caracara's. For example, Bartram observed the birds following wildfires to scavenge for burned insects and box turtles. Such behavior is typical of caracaras, but the larger and shorter-legged king vultures are not well adapted for walking. The northern crested caracara (Caracara cheriway) was believed to be common and conspicuous in Bartram's days, but it is notably absent from Bartram's notes if the painted vulture is accepted as a Sarcoramphus. However, Francis Harper {{argued that the}} bird could, as in the 1930s, have been rare in the area Bartram visited and could have been missed.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} driver behind the modern use of concrete was Smeaton's Tower, the third Eddystone Lighthouse in Devon, England.

25|$|Hoffmann's {{literature}} {{indicates the}} failings of many so-called artists {{to differentiate between}} the superficial and the authentic aspects of such Romantic ideals.
