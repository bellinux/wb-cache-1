40|$|Summary: Within {{the scope}} of work package 2, two web {{services}} have been developed which allows semantic enrichment and disambiguation of scientific articles as well as mind maps. These services have been named <b>Enrichment</b> <b>Service</b> and Disambiguation Service. In the case of scientific articles, which are typically stored as PDF documents, the documents are first parsed, analysed and extracted. Here the PDFs are split into their structure, which allows us to re-create the original table of contents. Furthermore a set of metadata, for example the author names, are extracted. The algorithms, which have been developed to build the <b>Enrichment</b> <b>Service,</b> have been evaluated against existing or newly created data-set and the results have been published. The task of the Disambiguation Service is to disambiguate entities discovered by the <b>Enrichment</b> <b>Service</b> as well as disambiguate table columns.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{two aspects}} of the nuclear fuel cycle system with significant policy implications. The first is the preferred option for used fuel storage based on economics: local, regional or national storage. The second is the implications of small modular reactor (SMR) introduction for the nuclear fuel cycle, including demand <b>for</b> uranium, <b>enrichment</b> <b>services</b> {{and the amount of}} used nuclear fuel. The study considers the nuclear energy system evolution over a period of 100 years. Through a review of available literature, post-reactor fuel storage and handling options have been evaluated using the best economic parameters that can be found. A system dynamics module, known as the Used Nuclear Fuel Module (UNFM), was created to account for the costs of on-site or off-site storage, and the needed transportation to the storage location. It provides an easy to use interface for studies of economics of used fuel storage. This module was used to evaluate the local, regional, and national storage options of used nuclear fuel. The results indicate that local storage on reactor sites is the least cost option, and that the cost of the storage casks is the most sensitive parameter for the local option cost. Additionally, a module was created {{for the study of the}} impact of small modular reactors, known as the SMRM or Small Modular Reactor Module, to study the fuel cycle impacts. This module was then incorporated into the library of reactor types in CAFCA to enable its inclusion in nuclear fuel cycle studies. The assumption was made that about 80 % of the new capacity of nuclear power plants would be of the SMR type for a high deployment and 20 % of the new capacity of SMR type for a low deployment with the nuclear power growth rate is 2. 5 % for the period from 2014 to 2114. It is shown that the single-batch nuclear fuel cycle approach of SMRs will require higher enrichment, more uranium ore and <b>enrichment</b> <b>services</b> will be needed. Also, given the lower burnup of the discharged fuel, larger amount of stored fuel will materialize. Given that the SMRs are likely to be built on new sites, there will also be significantly more sites containing the used nuclear fuel. by Samuel O. Brinton. Thesis: S.

These facilities include the X- 343 Feed Vaporization and Sampling Facility, the X- 744 G Bulk Non-Uranium <b>Enrichment</b> <b>Service</b> Activity (UESA) Storage Building, the X- 744 H Waste Separation and Storage Facility, the X- 344 A Toll <b>Enrichment</b> <b>Services</b> Facility and the X- 342 A Feed Vaporization and Fluorine Generation Facility. As uranium operations are performed within these facilities, {{the potential for a}} criticality accident exists. In the event of a criticality accident within a process facility at PORTS, a Criticality Accident Alarm System (CAAS) is in place to detect the criticality accident and sound an alarm. In this report, an analysis was performed to provide verification that the existing CAAS at PORTS provides complete criticality accident coverage in the X- 343, X- 744 G. X- 744 H.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} Australia {{could become a}} major {{supplier}} of uranium <b>enrichment</b> <b>services,</b> taking a significant step towards establishing multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle as a global norm. Introduction: Australia has the world 2 ̆ 7 s largest uranium reserves—one third of the world total—and {{is part of the}} Asia-Pacific region, the region of largest growth in nuclear power utilisation. Accordingly, Australia seems well placed to become a major supplier of uranium <b>enrichment</b> <b>services</b> in the future. This is not simply a commercial issue, but could help advance non-proliferation objectives. Uranium enrichment is a dual-use technology—a country with a national enrichment program has the potential to use this for producing nuclear weapons. Increasing awareness of this proliferation risk has prompted efforts to develop a new international framework for nuclear energy, emphasising international cooperation as an alternative to national fuel cycle programs. A multilaterally-based enrichment centre in Australia, with regional participation, could obviate further national enrichment programs in the region and would be a significant step towards establishing multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle as a global norm...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the two fuel banks, the Russian Federation has also established an International Uranium Enrichment Center (IUEC) located at Angarsk. The IUEC is set up as a joint stock company between Russia's Rosatom Corporation holding 80% of the shares, Kazakhstani and Ukrainian corporations, while the government of Armenia slated to join the company in the future. The IUEC differs from the two fuel banks in several important ways. First, it is a for-profit entity owned by state-backed companies. As a result, unlike the fuel banks, it is preferential and exclusive in its provision of <b>enrichment</b> <b>services.</b> The IUEC gives preferential treatment to its shareholders when selling <b>enrichment</b> <b>services,</b> and is only available to states {{that do not have}} domestic enrichment capabilities and perform their obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Like the fuel banks, it provides an alternative to the expensive start-up costs of an indigenous enrichment capacity, but unlike the fuel banks it provides a further financial incentive to its shareholders in the form of dividends.|$|R
