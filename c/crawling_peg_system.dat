40|$|Summary: The stable {{macroeconomic}} environment, {{as one of}} {{the primary}} objectives of the Visegrad countries in the 1990 s, was partially supported by the exchange rate policy. Fixed exchange rate systems within gradually widen bands (Czech Republic, Slovak Republic) and <b>crawling</b> <b>peg</b> <b>system</b> (Hungary, Poland) were replaced by the managed floating in the Czech Republic (May 1997), Poland (April 2000), Slovak Republic (Oc-tober 1998) and fixed exchange rate to euro in Hungary (January 2000) with broad band (October 2001). Higher macroeconomic and banking sector stability allowed countries from the Visegrad group to implement the monetary policy strategy based on the interest rate transmission mechanism.

40|$|In {{parallel}} (dual) foreign-exchange markets - extremely {{common in}} developing countries - a market-determined exchange rate coexists {{with one or more}} pegged exchange rates. The authors report the main lessons from a World Bank research project on how these systems work, based mainly on case studies in Argentina, Ghana, Mexico, Sudan, Tanzania, Turkey, Venezuela, and Zambia. On the whole, the experiences were disappointing. Most countriestolerated high premiums for long periods, which harmed the allocation of resources and growth. The studies indicate no clear gains from prolonging a dual system. The case for a dual foreign exchange system is stronger when the system is adopted as a temporary option to deal with a severe balance of payments crisis. Argentina, Mexico, and Venezuela resorted to a dual system {{at the time of the}} debt crisis, to smooth out the devaluation in the exchange rate to achieve the needed real depreciation. This helped to maintain limited control over domestic inflation, and avoided a sharp drop in real wages while protecting the balance of payments. In the longer term, not much was gained. In the cases studied, the dual system was misused more often than not: it was used too long and the premium was higher than is should have been. Venezuela, for example, used the system for six years with an average 120 percent premium, Mexico for five years (average 30 percent), and Argentina for eight years (average 44 percent). In Argentina and Venezuela, the dual system was used to avoid macroeconomic adjustment while protecting international reserves. It is doubtful the macroeconomic gains (in terms of keeping equilibrium in the balance of payments and lower inflation) were greater than the costs in terms of misallocation of resources. In Ghana and Tanzania, the dual exchange rate system was prolonged to maintain overvalued real exchange rates and expansionary macroeconomic policies. The large premium in those countries (at times more than 1, 000 percent) shows the dramatic inconsistency between exchange rate policy and monetary and fiscal policies. On determinants of the parallel exchange rate, the evidence indicates that macroeconomic fundaments (such as fiscal deficit, credit policies, and so on) matter most. In the short run the premium is driven by expectation about the evolution of these macroeconomic factors. Overall, in the countries examined in the project, the existence of a parallel foreign exchange market generated fiscal losses. These losses resulted because the public sector was a net seller of foreign exchange rate. This means that unification has some pleasant fiscal arithmetic. The experience with unification indicates that it usually takes place at the parallel exchange rate. Most countries unified to a <b>crawling</b> <b>peg</b> <b>system,</b> though some opted for floating exchange rates. Successful unification to a fixed exchange rate was less frequent, and it required strong adjustment in fiscal and monetary policies. Regarding speed, unification was quick in countries where the parallel system was used temporarily, and gradual in those where the system existed for long periods and with a tradition of widespread foreign exchange controls.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper was to {{investigate}} the manner in which exchange rate policy was carried out in Poland in the years 1990 - 1994. Relations between the exchange rate policy and monetary policy as well as changes in the foreign trade structure after the implementation of exchange policy have been analysed and a differentiation between a fixed exchange rate and the <b>crawling</b> <b>peg</b> has been made. Despite the controversy over the first phase ('overshooting' and delayed introduction of the <b>crawling</b> <b>peg),</b> the foreign exchange rate policy in the investigated period deserves to be evaluated very highly. A recommendation drafted in the paper proposes a change {{in the structure of the}} currency basket (which should consist of ECU and USD only) and gradual lowering of the <b>crawling</b> <b>peg</b> rate until a fixed exchange rate is achieved when inflation rate is reduced to a one digit level.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the {{determinants}} of currency crises and to illustrate the dynamic behaviour of the fundamental macroeconomic variables in a small open economy under a peg regime.

Turkey was successful to fix domestic credit at the same time with a <b>crawling</b> <b>peg</b> regime in order to achieve price stability. Furthermore, the political preferences were also in favour of continuing the program. Though these facts, the peg collapsed by a speculative attack. Depending on these issues, in our model, which uses a Keynesian framework augmented with a speculative foreign exchange market, it has been focused on the fundamental macroeconomic relationship between budget and trade deficits. In the simulation experiment derived from our theoretical model, we have found that it does not matter whether the budget deficit is financed by monetization or domestic borrowing, the increase in the total budget deficit causes the trade deficit and the devalutionary expectations to rise via the increase in national income. The conclusion is that, unless there is a decreasing budget deficit, it is inevitable to prevent the <b>peg</b> <b>system</b> to collapse...|$|R
