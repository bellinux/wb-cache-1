5|$|Hypothyroidism {{is caused}} by {{inadequate}} function of the gland itself (primary hypothyroidism), inadequate stimulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland (secondary hypothyroidism), or inadequate release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the brain's hypothalamus (tertiary hypothyroidism).

5|$|A {{brain tumor}} is an {{abnormal}} growth of cells within the brain or inside the skull, {{and can be}} cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just over half of all primary brain tumors are malignant; the rest are benign, though they may still be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times more <b>common</b> <b>than</b> primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.|$|E
5|$|Advanced COPD {{leads to}} high {{pressure}} on the lung arteries, which strains the right ventricle of the heart. This situation {{is referred to as}} cor pulmonale, and leads to symptoms of leg swelling and bulging neck veins. COPD is more <b>common</b> <b>than</b> any other lung disease as a cause of cor pulmonale. Cor pulmonale has become less common since the use of supplemental oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Ontario {{has been}} the most populous {{province}} and region in Canada since the birth of the country in 1867.

5|$|Although {{far less}} <b>common</b> <b>than</b> other metallo{{proteins}} (e.g. those of zinc and iron), cobaltoproteins are known aside from B12. These proteins include methionine aminopeptidase 2, an enzyme {{that occurs in}} humans and other mammals that does not use the corrin ring of B12, but binds cobalt directly. Another non-corrin cobalt enzyme is nitrile hydratase, an enzyme in bacteria that metabolize nitriles.|$|E
5|$|However, {{much of the}} {{currently}} information regarding the smoking habits of North Koreans is obtained by studying North Korean defectors who now live in the South {{and may not be}} totally representative of the true picture. One study of defectors found that smoking is even more <b>common</b> <b>than</b> anticipated, but nicotine dependence was not as severe as predicted. Defectors are reported as often being very interested in quitting smoking.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the variety}} of harmful uses of poisons {{continued}} to increase. The means for curing these poisons also advanced in parallel.

5|$|Physical {{training}} goals {{pursued in}} conjunction with aikido include controlled relaxation, correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders, flexibility, and endurance, with less emphasis on strength training. In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more <b>common</b> <b>than</b> pulling or contracting movements. This distinction {{can be applied to}} general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.|$|E
5|$|Plain milk was not {{consumed}} by adults except the poor or sick, being {{reserved for the}} very young or elderly, and then usually as buttermilk or whey. Fresh milk was overall less <b>common</b> <b>than</b> other dairy products {{because of the lack}} of technology to keep it from spoiling. Tea and coffee, both made from plants found in the Old World, were popular in East Asia and the Muslim world during the Middle Ages. However, neither of these non-alcoholic social drinks were consumed in Europe before the late 16th and early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium is the twenty-third most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust, roughly as abundant as zinc and rather more <b>common</b> <b>than</b> copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, and zinnwaldite, which contain as much as 1% rubidium oxide. Lepidolite contains between 0.3% and 3.5% rubidium, and is the commercial source of the element. Some potassium minerals and potassium chlorides also contain the element in commercially significant quantities.|$|E

5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} occur in {{water in the}} Black Creek watershed, with sodium being considerably more <b>common</b> <b>than</b> potassium. Potassium concentrations are around 20 milligrams per liter, while sodium concentrations are less than 10 milligrams per liter. Lithium and rubidium also have been observed in the watershed, with concentrations of 0.02 to 0.2 and 0.04 milligrams per liter, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{commonly}} include ecchymosis and swelling. The pain {{is generally}} {{more severe than}} bites from the copperhead, but less so than those from rattlesnakes (Crotalus spp.). The formation of vesicles and bullae is less <b>common</b> <b>than</b> with rattlesnake bites, although necrosis can occur. Myokymia is sometimes reported. However, the venom has strong proteolytic activity {{that can lead to}} severe tissue destruction.|$|E
5|$|The {{imperial}} and US systems {{differ in}} the size of the basic unit (the gallon or the pint, one gallon being equal to eight pints), and in the number of fluid ounces per pint.

Before introduction of the imperial units in the UK, all apothecaries' measures were based on the wine gallon, which survived in the US under the name liquid gallon or wet gallon.|$|E

5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} is less <b>common</b> <b>than</b> {{carotid artery}} dissection (dissection {{of the large}} arteries {{in the front of}} the neck). The two conditions together account for 10–25% of non-hemorrhagic strokes in young and middle-aged people. Over 75% recover completely or with minimal impact on functioning, with the remainder having more severe disability and a very small proportion (about 2%) dying from complications. It was first described in the 1970s by the Canadian neurologist C. Miller Fisher.|$|E
5|$|Work by {{engineer}} Mieczysław G.

Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to wheeled locomotion in natural terrains at all size scales. The primary means of obstacle navigation are to go around obstacles and to go over them; each has its attendant challenges.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{rates of}} either HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 are between 60 and 95% in adults. HSV-1 is more <b>common</b> <b>than</b> HSV-2, with rates of both {{increasing}} as people age.
