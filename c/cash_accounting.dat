An instance of free-riding will cause a <b>cash</b> <b>account</b> to be restricted for 90 days to purchasing securities with cash up front. Under Regulation T, brokers must “freeze” an investor’s account for 90 days if he/she sells securities that have not been fully paid (i.e.,paid for with unavailable funds). During this 90-day period, the investor must fully pay for any purchase on the date of the trade.|$|R

50|$|The revenue {{recognition}} principle is {{a cornerstone of}} accrual accounting together with the matching principle. They both determine the accounting period, in which revenues and expenses are recognized. According to the principle, revenues are recognized when they are realized or realizable, and are earned (usually when goods are transferred or services rendered), no matter when cash is received. In <b>cash</b> <b>accounting</b> - in contrast - revenues are recognized when cash is received no matter when goods or services are sold.|$|E

These should sum to the 10,000 USD average capital of the portfolio as a whole. From the average capital of each of the two components of the portfolio, we can calculate weights. The weight of the <b>cash</b> <b>account</b> is the average capital of the <b>cash</b> <b>account,</b> divided by the average capital (10,000 USD) of the portfolio, and the weight of the shares is the average capital of the shares over the whole year, divided by the average capital of the portfolio.|$|R

50|$|Automobile {{dealers who}} {{still wanted to}} sell cars {{had to find a}} way to deal with the {{increasing}} price of vehicles relative to income. They had to sell these vehicles to wary consumers who were unwilling or unable to pay 'cash' for the new purchase. In many cases, when banks would not loan to the consumer, the Automobile dealer would start a related finance company (RFC) and have that finance company approve the loan on the vehicle. This was a bold step into the banking business for automobile dealers. The advantage to the dealership of having an RFC finance the sale was decreased risk on the sale and finance of the vehicles sold. Since both companies had the same ownership, dealers could now essentially benefit from the profit on both the sale and the loan for a single vehicle. Historically, the down payment required on a BHPH loan was generally larger than the total profit on the sale of the vehicle. Therefore, if the buyer didn’t make payments, the RFC could repossess the vehicle and sell it again at the dealership. Since 2008, many outside lending institutions have entered the market and the average down payment on a BHPH loan has significantly decreased, as dealers try to maintain a share of the market. Many of the benefits of separating the RFC out from the BHPH dealership are based in the tax code changes of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. In that act it restricted any companies that utilize inventory in their operating business from using <b>cash</b> <b>accounting.</b>|$|E

In this paper, we present an empirical survey to understand whether we can choose accrual or <b>cash</b> <b>accounting</b> system.

The survey considers four sub hypotheses and one main hypothesis to see whether there are reliable rules and regulations in accrual-based accounting compared with <b>cash</b> <b>accounting</b> or not. Similarly, the survey investigates whether accrual-based accounting is more informative, comprehensive and provides better comparative results compared with <b>cash</b> <b>accounting.</b> The results indicate that accrual-based account performs better in terms of all mentioned criteria and it is a better method for managing accounting affairs compared with <b>cash</b> <b>accounting</b> systems...|$|E

Due to instruments, like information technology, simplified <b>cash</b> <b>accounting</b> or outsourcing compliance activities to tax advisers, private businesses {{have a set of}} strategies to optimize their tax compliance cost burden. Under the assumption of rational choice a private business should choose a cost-optimal administration strategy. In spite of that we find empirical evidence for small German businesses using only insufficiently the support of external tax advisers. Therefore, a considerable number of small businesses in Germany could reduce their compliance cost burden by a higher degree of outsourcing tax processes. In contrast, we find no significant evidence for a cost reduction by an electronic data interchange with the tax and social insurance authorities or by a simplified <b>cash</b> <b>accounting</b> method for tax purposes.

40|$|The <b>cash</b> <b>accounting</b> {{system for}} VAT has been {{implemented}} in Romania as of 1 January 2013 and now turns {{one year of}} application in Romania. Since its implementation the system has sparked controversy, being harshly criticised by professional accountants in Romania and elsewhere. Criticisms mainly concerned the following issues: no possibility to choose to apply the system, breach of the VAT neutrality principles, maximum period of 90 days to postpone the chargeability of VAT for unpaid deliveries, while VAT deduction was subject to payment {{of the value of}} goods and services invoiced without specifying any term.

Finally, we intend to compare the <b>cash</b> <b>accounting</b> system for VAT in Romania with its UK counterpart. ...|$|E
