25|$|In the endgame, it <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> race {{over who}} can checkmate the {{opponent}} first. A tactic known as speed counting {{plays an important}} role in the endgame. By counting the number of moves until checkmate (assuming the opponent doesn't get to move) for both Black and White, this will help to influence decisions on whether to attack or defend. A simple mistake can change the flow of the game drastically. Among this, there are many other delicate factors to look out for within the endgame, including sacrificial attacks and traps.|$|E
25|$|Units {{that can}} attack, do so either {{directly}} (can attack adjacent to another unit where standing or moved, but be counter-attacked {{by the enemy}} unit), or in-directly (must remain still to attack, and have an enemy in firing range). The amount of damage done by a unit to an enemy unit in combat, <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> number of factors: the number of hit points the attacker has, whether they can use their main weapon (if not, they either cannot, or will use their secondary weapon instead), the type of unit the attacker and the defender are, and the terrain the enemy unit is on; by contrast, if the enemy unit is directly attacked, the same factors determine the damage done when they counter-attack the attacking unit. The majority of units have main weapons with a limited supply of ammunition, {{with the amount of}} ammo {{depending on the type of}} unit. Units with secondary weapons will resort to these when their primary weapon's ammunition runs out, until they are resupplied.|$|E

500|$|Two {{distinct}} phenomena {{are covered}} by the shift he observed in Greek culture {{at the end of}} the 5th century: the content of thought (in particular the concept of man or of the soul), and the organisation of thought. In Homer, Havelock argues, the order of ideas is associative and temporal. The epic's [...] "units of meaning ... are linked associatively to form an episode, but the parts of the episode are greater than the whole." [...] For Plato, on the other hand, the purpose of thought is to arrive at the significance of the whole, to move from the specific to the general. Havelock points out that Plato's syntax, which he shares with other 4th-century writers, reflects that organisation, making smaller ideas subordinate to bigger ideas. Thus, the Platonic theory of forms in itself, Havelock claims, derives from a shift in the organisation of the Greek language, and ultimately <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> different function for and conception of the noun.|$|E

Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now." [...] Gossard stated, [...] "We've {{made a couple of}} political and pointed records, the last two in particular, and just to move away from that is great, because it allows you {{to go back to that}} when you need to and it refreshes everybody, and it <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> beat and a melody and your friends and a lyric and a poem and something that's important to you." [...] Vedder stated he did not spend [...] "more than half hour" [...] writing the lyrics to each song: [...] "If it’s not gonna happen quick then I don’t wanna do it, because it means there’s another one out there that is gonna happen quick, and is gonna hit you like a lightning bolt." ...|$|E
500|$|... "La Isla Bonita" [...] is a Hispanic styled pop song. It {{is one of}} the {{characteristic}} works of the collaboration between Madonna and Patrick Leonard. The single mixes the sound of different instruments like Cuban drums and Spanish guitar, maracas and harmonicas and a mix of synthesized and real drumming. The song is written in the key of C minor and is set in the time signature of common time like most pop songs, moving at a moderate tempo of 95 beats per minute. The song starts with a musical introduction performed on a Cuban drum, before descending into synthesized beats and Spanish guitar fusion. Madonna sings the chorus in the same G3 to C5 range. After the second chorus there is a Spanish guitar interlude whence Madonna's voice expands to F minor as she sings [...] "I want to be where the sun warms the sky" [...] and then <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> C minor when she sings [...] "loves a girl". There is another musical interlude with a harmonica and the song, after another chorus, ends with fading out and Madonna's voice uttering the words [...] "El dijo que te ama (He said he loves you)".|$|E

On 19 November 2007, in the Dutch Parliament, the Secretary of Defence was questioned about the JSF delay, technical problems and rising costs.

On March 12, 2015, the film's title was revealed to be Rogue One, with Chris Weitz rewriting the script, and starring Felicity Jones, Ben Mendelsohn, and Diego Luna. In April 2015, a teaser trailer was shown during the closing of the Star Wars Celebration. Lucasfilm also announced filming would begin in the summer of 2015, and the plot synopsis. Director Edwards stated, [...] "It <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> group of individuals who don't have magical powers that have to somehow bring hope to the galaxy."; and describing the style of the film as similar to that of a war film: [...] "It's the reality of war. Good guys are bad. Bad guys are good. It's complicated, layered; a very rich scenario in which to set a movie." [...] After its debut, Rogue One received generally positive reviews, with its performances, action sequences, soundtrack, visual effects and darker tone being praised.
