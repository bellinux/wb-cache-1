5|$|After a brief postponement, an {{announcement}} was made on 1 February 1942, detailing how the cabinet had elected Quisling to the post of Minister-President of the national government. The appointment {{was accompanied by a}} banquet, rallying and other celebrations by the Nasjonal Samling members. In his first speech, Quisling <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> government to closer ties with Germany. The only change to the Constitution was the reinstatement of the ban on Jewish entry into Norway, which had been abolished in 1851.|$|E
5|$|All Islanders were {{required}} to work 30 hours each week, and up until the 1960s no wages were paid for this work. The catalyst for the strike was the attempted deportation of Indigenous inmate Albie Geia who <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> offence of disobeying the European overseer. The strike continued for five days and was broken with dawn raids to remove the families involved by boat to the mainland.|$|E

5|$|Clinton said Republican {{amendments}} would {{strip the}} U.S. Treasury {{of its ability}} to dip into federal trust funds to avoid a borrowing crisis. Republican amendments would have limited appeals by death-row inmates, made it harder to issue health, safety and environmental regulations, and would have <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> president to a seven-year balanced budget. Clinton vetoed a second bill allowing the government to keep operating beyond the time when most spending authority expires.|$|E
5|$|Dasima is a njai (concubine) for the Englishman Edward William. Together {{with their}} daughter, Nancy, the couple {{live in a}} home near Gambir Square in Batavia (modern day Jakarta). Their happy life is {{disturbed}} after the delman driver Samioen {{falls in love with}} Dasima, despite already being married to Hajati. He attempts to use magic (goena-goena) to win her heart, and asks an egg merchant, Mak Boejoeng, to frighten Dasima by telling the young woman that she has <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> sin of zina (extramarital sex).|$|E
5|$|In Smith's view, the {{opportunity}} to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity; those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf. Smith said that children who died in their innocence would be guaranteed to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation. Apart from those who <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> eternal sin, Smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife.|$|E
50|$|To {{perform a}} gated <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> {{software}} developer must request a gated <b>commit</b> from <b>the</b> CI server before <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> actual changes {{to a central}} location. The CI server merges the local changes {{with the head of}} the master branch and performs the validations (build and tests) that make up the gate. So the developer can see if his or her changes break the build without actually <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> changes. A <b>commit</b> to <b>the</b> central location will only be allowed if the gates are cleared.|$|R

5|$|In a December 2013 interview, Nirbhaya's parents, Badri Nath Singh and Asha Devi, {{said they}} were trying to get the {{juvenile}} law changed in such crimes as the rape and murder of their daughter. They petitioned the Supreme Court to try the juvenile, just short of 18 when he <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> crime, in a criminal court instead of a Juvenile Justice court.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Veronica and {{her father}} Keith (Enrico Colantoni) {{investigate}} more suspects {{in the murder of}} Dean O'Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.), particularly his wife Mindy (Jaime Ray Newman) and her lover Hank Landry (Patrick Fabian). Both of them become particularly suspicious when they disappear, and Hank is implied as the killer when Mindy's dead body washes onshore. However, Veronica later deduces that teaching assistant Tim Foyle (James Jordan) <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> murder to frame Hank.|$|E
5|$|Key {{says that}} he {{believes}} {{that global warming is}} a real phenomenon, and that the Government needs to implement measures to reduce human contribution to global warming. Key has <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> National Party to working towards reducing greenhouse emissions in New Zealand by 50% within the next fifty years. Commentators note that as recently as 2005, Key made statements indicating that he was sceptical of the effects and impact of climate change.|$|E

5|$|Law enforcement's corrupt {{attitude}} generally {{was not at}} {{the expense}} of the people. Apart from the economic benefits provided by the Maceos, these bosses provided a high degree of protection to the island's citizens. When serious crimes were <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> local police would sometimes contact the Maceos to have the matter dealt with. However, the island was not completely peaceful; threats at the point of a gun were a common means for the Maceo gang to ensure control. Though the average citizen was relatively safe, gangland slayings of potential rivals did take place on occasion.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, Samutsevich's new lawyer, Irina Khrunova, {{argued that}} her client had {{not in fact}} <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> acts of hooliganism in the church as she was {{prevented}} from accessing the soleas by church security. The court appeared to accept this argument, and released Samutsevich on two years' probation. However, the judges rejected the appeals of Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina, upholding their convictions and sentences.|$|E
5|$|The Austrians {{fell back}} into Alessandria, having lost about half the forces they had <b>committed.</b> <b>The</b> Austrians had lost heavily in the 12 hours of fighting: 15 colours, 40 guns, almost 8,000 taken prisoner, and 6,500 dead or wounded. French {{casualties}} (killed and wounded) were {{on the order of}} 4,700 and 900 missing or captured, but they retained the battlefield and the strategic initiative. Desaix's body was found among the slain.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to such criticism, evolutionary psychologists often caution against <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> naturalistic fallacy – the assumption that [...] "what is natural" [...] is necessarily a moral good. However, their caution against <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> naturalistic fallacy has been criticized as means to stifle legitimate ethical discussions.|$|R

5|$|The Metropolitan Police, City of London Police, {{and private}} {{organisations such as}} the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee were {{involved}} in the search for the killer or killers. Despite extensive inquiries and several arrests, the culprit or culprits evaded identification and capture. The murders drew attention to the poor living conditions in the East End slums, which were subsequently improved. The enduring mystery of who <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> crimes has captured public imagination to the present day.|$|E
5|$|The {{cross-examination}} of him {{and other}} witnesses by Birkett swayed the jury, and they took only fifteen minutes to find Rouse guilty of murder. After his appeal had been rejected by both the Court of Appeal and the Home Secretary, Rouse {{admitted that he had}} in fact <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> murder– although he never gave a reason– it was theorised that he had done so in an attempt to fake his own death. Despite his admission of guilt the identity of the victim has never been discovered.|$|E
5|$|The first sod {{was turned}} at Galashiels on 3 March 2010, when Scottish {{transport}} minister Stewart Stevenson attended a ceremony {{in the presence}} of campaigner Madge Elliot. This triggered a clause in the 2006 Waverley Railway Act, which <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> Scottish Government to complete the line to Tweedbank once works had been commenced.|$|E
30|$|The {{potential}} need {{to consider}} behavioral economic processes such as the sunk-cost fallacy when formulating approaches to health disparities may be compounded by the negative relation between <b>committing</b> <b>the</b> sunk-cost fallacy and socioeconomic status (i.e., income). Specifically, individuals that <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> sunk-cost fallacy have significantly lower incomes, and thus may be more subject to programs aimed at alleviating health disparities such as Medicaid. The precise relation between <b>the</b> tendency to <b>commit</b> <b>the</b> sunk-cost fallacy and utilization of programs aimed at decreasing health disparities, however, should be further investigated.|$|R

5|$|The {{proximate}} {{cause of the}} conflict was {{the death of a}} Praying Indian named John Sassamon in 1675. Sassamon had been an advisor and friend to King Philip; however, Sassamon's conversion to Christianity had driven the two apart. Accused in the murder of Sassamon were some of Philip's most senior lieutenants. A jury of twelve Englishmen and six Praying Indians found the Native Americans guilty of murder and sentenced them to death. To this day, some debate exists whether King Philip's men actually <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> murder.|$|E
5|$|The series {{centers on}} FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and her new}} partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)—following the alien {{abduction}} of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, the fatal shooting of a realtor, while alone in a cinderblock jail cell, has Doggett struggling {{to find out who}} <b>committed</b> <b>the</b> murder and how the crime was committed. Scully and Doggett, however, soon learn that there is more to this case than meets the eye.|$|E
