Partial efficacy of ARV-based medications has been demonstrated {{in a number of}} clinical trials around the world among various populations, building the evidence that ARV-based technologies will contribute to reducing the AIDS epidemic worldwide. Disappointing results, however, from two trials in sub-Saharan Africa, where poor adherence contributed to study closure due to futility, have raised questions about whether women at the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> the <b>epidemic</b> are able to effectively use products that require routine use. Also, there are fears by some of risk compensation by decreased condom use because of the availability of micro-bicides when only partial efficacy has been demonstrated in microbicide trials to date. Of note, sub-analyses of biologic measures of adherence in trials where this was possible have shown a strong correlation between good adherence and efficacy, reinforcing the necessity of good adherence. Research conducted in conjunction with clinical trials and post-trials in advance of possible rollout of ARV-based products have examined social and cultural factors, gender-related and otherwise, influencing adherence and other aspects of women’s use of products. These include HIV stigma, women’s perception of risk, partner and community influences and the differing needs of women in various stages of life and in different circumstances.

40|$|In {{the present}} work the spread <b>of</b> <b>epidemic</b> is studied over complex {{networks}} which {{are characterized by}} power law degree distribution of links and heterogeneous rate of disease transmission. The random allocation <b>of</b> <b>epidemic</b> transmission rates to the nodes results in the heterogeneity, which in turn causes the segregation of nodes in terms of various sub populations. The aim {{of the study is}} to gain microscopic insight into the effect of interactions among various sub populations in the spreading processes of disease over such networks. The discrete time Markov chain method based upon the susceptible infected susceptible (SIS) model of diseases transmission has been used to describe the spreading <b>of</b> <b>epidemic</b> over the networks. The study is parameterized in terms of variable λ, defined as the number of contacts a node makes with the fraction of its neighboring nodes. From the simulation results, it is found that the spread <b>of</b> <b>epidemic</b> on such networks is critical in terms of number of minimum contacts made by a node below which there is no outbreak of disease. The degree of infection in these networks is assessed from the size <b>of</b> <b>epidemic</b> defined in terms of fraction of infected nodes of the total number and their corresponding level of infection. The results of the parametric study demonstrates the dependence <b>of</b> the <b>epidemic</b> size upon number of concurrent contacts made by a node (λ) and the average number of links per node.
