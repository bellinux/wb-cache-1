It is genetically specified by expression of Dlx genes; its progenitor zones contribute a huge variety of neuronal cell types throughout the telencephalon; it is the origin and substrate of multiple and complex migration and navigation pathways during embryogenesis; and its derivatives, i. e. the basal ganglia and the amygdaloid complex, are highly conserved through evolution. Comparative developmental studies point to a largely <b>common</b> <b>basic</b> plan to generate the subpallium in vertebrates, including comparable progenitor domains and similar migratory cellular movements.
