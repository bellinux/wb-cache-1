50|$|The Opti-Fan system {{compensates}} automatically {{for continuous}} uphill or downhill gradients in combines. When driving downhill, material moves against gravity {{and therefore more}} slowly over the grainpan and top sieve, causing it to remain longer in the cleaning shoe and the layer thickness to increase. More ‘material other than grain' (MOG) remains in the cleaning shoe as the set <b>cleaning</b> <b>fan</b> speed is insufficient to clear the crop. Driving uphill causes the material layer to decrease as it moves more quickly out of the shoe under gravity. The air flow from the fan is too high for the thin layer of material which results in the material travelling too quickly over the top causing increased grain losses. The fan speed control system senses the combine’s angle of ascent or descent and automatically adjusts the <b>cleaning</b> <b>fan</b> speed to compensate. The operator sets the level-field fan speed and the system reduces the speed when travelling uphill and increases it downhill to optimise the material layer thickness on the cleaning shoe.Opti-fan system was awarded with a Silver Medal at Agritechnica in 2009.|$|E
30|$|There are {{relations}} among different quality indicators in data <b>cleaning.</b> <b>Fan</b> et al. [7] shows that data quality indicators {{are not completely}} isolated. Although the data cleaning strategy might be designed for a given indicator, it may influence another indicator at the same time. For example, the cleaning of missing data mending may lead to uncertain changes in the accuracy measurement of the data when improving the integrity, {{due to the fact}} that the related cleaning technologies cannot guarantee data correctness [8]. For abnormal data correction, the data correctness can be improved without changing the measurement of data integrity indicators. However, the current research works are less concerned with the impact of the relationship between various quality indicators, and systematic studies on the relationship between quality indicators in wireless sensor networks are still an interesting issue.|$|E
40|$|Modern {{harvesting}} machines {{are required to}} meet the increasing needs of capacity and output under {{a wide range of}} field and crop conditions. One of the critical factors to fulfill the current demand is the capacity of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>fan.</b> In order to obtain an effective cleaning action, the fan has to generate a forceful and even air flow over and through the complete width of sieves. In this paper, a forward curved wide centrifugal fan with two parallel outlets is studied numerically and experimentally for the flow uniformity at the outlets. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to study the effect of a cross-flow opening on the performance of the centrifugal fan. In addition to the CFD calculations, velocity profiles are measured at the outlets of the fan; with and without the crossflow opening using hot-wire anemometry. It is found out that addition of the cross-flow opening has brought limited effect on the general performance of the fan but {{plays an important role in}} having uniform air flow along the width of the outlets.

50|$|Shooting {{was halted}} while the actors took the weekend off. Over the weekend, the pie residue spoiled, {{all over the}} scenery. When the actors {{returned}} Monday morning, the pie filling smelled so bad that the building required a thorough <b>cleaning</b> and large <b>fans</b> to blow out the sour air. The missing pie residue was carefully recreated with more pies, and shooting resumed.|$|R
5|$|In some {{parenting}} species, young from {{a previous}} spawning batch may stay with their parents and help care for the new young. This is known to occur in around 19 species of cichlids in Lake Tanganyika. These helpers take part in <b>cleaning</b> and <b>fanning</b> eggs and larvae, cleaning the breeding hole and protecting the territory. They have reduced growth rate but gain protection from predators. Brood parasitism also exists among teleosts; minnows may spawn in sunfish nests as well as nests of other minnow species. The cuckoo catfish is known for laying eggs on the substrate as mouthbrooding cichclids collect theirs and the young catfish will eat the cichlid larvae. Filial cannibalism occurs in some teleost families and may have evolved to combat starvation.|$|R
40|$|Biomass is {{used for}} fuel by {{humanity}} from prehistoric times. With {{the passage of time}} and to meet the energy needs, non-conventional ways of utilizing the conventional sources became an interest with use of technologies. Biomass gasification is a proven technology that can economically use alternative energy resource of “Carbon Neutral”. Biomass product gas from biomass gasification is composed of CO, CO 2, CH 4, H 2, other hydrocarbons, traces of other components and tar from biomass gasification. Fluidized bed gasification is one of the promising technologies to achieve high thermal conversion efficiency as it takes great advantages of fluidization in terms of uniform temperature profiles and excellent gas-solid interactions. The present research is aimed to evaluate the performance of a bubbling fluidized bed biomass gasifier for product gas production composition using air as gasification agent and SRC willow chips as biomass. Particle capture efficiency of the mop fan and an effect of different operating conditions such as bed temperature, equivalent ratio on the product gas composition and heating value are also investigated at Institute of Sustainable Energy Technology, University of Nottingham. The concentrations of particulate matter in the product gas before and after the mop <b>fan</b> <b>cleaning</b> unit are measured to assess the performance of the <b>cleaning</b> unit. Different <b>fan</b> rotating speeds and different flow rates of spray water are used to optimise the particle removal efficiency of this unit. It has been found that the mop <b>fan</b> <b>cleaning</b> unit has achieved an efficiency of 90 % in removing particle matters and an efficiency of more than 80 % in removing N-species presented in the product gas. Tars appear as a major issue in the product gas and should be removed from the product gas before they get condensed in the equipments which utilise product gas. Tar arrest techniques were successfully tested in this investigation such as woodchips bed, water spray and mop fan. The synergic effect of tar removal of water spray and mop fan found to be more effective in removing tars as if used individually. Different spray water amounts were used with a constant fan speed for keen observation of tars’ solubility in the water and found reasonable removal of tars from product gas...|$|R
40|$|In modern {{harvesting}} machines, one of {{the critical}} factors to fulfil the current demand of capacity and output under {{a wide range of}} field and crop conditions is the capacity of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>fan.</b> In order to obtain an effective cleaning action, the fan has to generate a forceful and even air flow over and through the complete width of sieves. This paper presents the effect of a cross-flow opening on the distribution of flow along the width of a forward curved, wide centrifugal fan with two parallel outlets. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is utilized to study the effect of the addition of a cross-flow opening on the performance of the fan using three fans of similar geometries but different in their cross-flow opening. Velocity profiles at the outlets of {{one of the}} fans are measured using X-wire hot-wire anemometers and they are used to validate the CFD simulations. Loads on the fan are created by using perforated plates whose resistance curves have been determined in a wind tunnel. It is found out that addition of the cross-flow opening throughout the whole width of the fan plays a crucial role in having uniform air flow along the width of the outlets of the fan. Comparisons between the simulations and measurements generally show good agreement. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of the mouthparts and distribution of cephalic sense organs of larval simuliids was investigated using the scanning electron microscope and methylene blue staining. The effect of water velocity, temperature and quality on larval feeding behaviour was studied in an artificial stream. Short, controlled, pulses of physical and chemical stimulants were injected into the water to observe their effect on larval feeding behaviour. Too rapid for the unaided eye, movements were described frame by frame from video recordings. Food is filtered from the water by the open cephalic fans. In alternation the fans are rapidly closed, swept by the mandible to remove food particles and opened again. The frequency of this endogenous behaviour pattern was modified by environmental factors that appeared to act mainly on the interval between fan beats. The interval between fan beats {{was found to be}} inversely related to water temperature and velocity and was also affected by water borne stimulants, being significantly shorter in unfiltered natural water than particle-free distilled water. Consequently <b>fan</b> <b>cleaning</b> frequency rose as water velocity and temperature were increased and when natural food was available. Larvae responded to pulses {{of a wide variety of}} chemical compounds with bursts of mandible and maxilla movements. <b>Fan</b> <b>cleaning</b> was inhibited when these mouthpart movements occurred but filtering continued. Short pulses of inert particles at a relatively high concentration caused a similar response but when a series of pulses was delivered bursts of mouthpart movements lengthened and the fans were often closed for longer than normal, inhibiting filtering. It is suggested that overstimulation of peripheral sense organs, responding to the physical and chemical qualities of food particles, initiates the inhibition of filtering. The temporary inhibition of feeding may regulate the rate of ingestion. A simple model of larval behaviour is proposed, recognising "food gathering" (filtering) and "food ingestion" (mouthpart movements) as its main components. <p...|$|R
40|$|In the fifteen-spined stickleback, Spinachia spinachia, males provide {{females with}} direct {{benefits}} by <b>fanning,</b> <b>cleaning</b> and guarding the offspring. Males announce their parental skills through intense body shakes during courtship. Females preferred {{to mate with}} more intensely shaking males. As a result, females got better fathers for their offspring, as such males achieved a higher hatching success. Not only did male behavioural cues attract females, but males also used their nests as extrabodily ornaments. The nest is held together with shiny secretional threads consisting of a glycoprotein. Females chose to spawn in nests with more secretional threads. A likely {{reason for this is}} that the threads are metabolically costly for the male to produce and the amount of secretion indicates a male's nutritional status, which is of great importance as parental duties are energetically costly. Moreover, females preferred nests built high up in the vegetation, as such nests were safer from egg predators. Competition with other males for females favoured males building higher nests than did their neighbours, probably because females preferred high nests. Male-male interactions, such as sneaking and egg stealing, caused decreased paternity among males in nature as assessed by a microsatellite analysis. Males adjusted their paternal effort according to their previous investment in the brood, but not according to paternity. Thus, female choice is based on multiple cues and results in better paternal care. Males invest in courtship, male-male competition, nest construction and paternal care, the outcome determining their success in mate attraction...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of instrumental {{activities of daily}} living (IADL) is crucial in enabling older people to achieve personal independence both at home and in the community. This study explored the characteristics of perceived complexity of IADL by older adults, with or without a history of stroke. A total of 120 older people were recruited and divided into equal groups of patients who had experienced a stroke (mean age, 69. 5 years) and people who had not (mean age, 68. 3 years). All participants were interviewed and completed a questionnaire on IADL containing 30 common IADL tasks with which the ratings on the perceived task complexity were assigned. The mean task complexity scores ranged from 2. 06 to 3. 63. The most complex tasks were <b>cleaning</b> an exhaust <b>fan</b> and using the mass transit railway, whereas the least complex task was maintaining social etiquette. In assigning the complexity ratings, participants generally defined complexity as “difficult and troublesome. ” The stroke patients generally perceived the tasks as significantly more complex when compared with their normal counterparts. The findings reinforce the need for awareness of rehabilitation professionals when providing interventions in IADL performance training, for which the ability of the patient and the difficulty in demands of the task should both be considered. Further studies are recommended for exploring the task content and criteria underlying the complexity of IADL tasks. The task domain formulated in this study takes us a step closer to the development of an IADL assessment tool for the Hong Kong Chinese population...|$|R
