40|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>random</b> <b>variables</b> {{are widely}} used to mathematically {{describe}} random phenomena in engineering and the physical sciences. In this paper, we present a higher-order logic formalization of the Standard Uniform <b>random</b> <b>variable</b> as the limit value of the sequence of its discrete approximations. We then show the correctness of this specification by proving the corresponding probability distribution properties within the HOL theorem prover, summarizing the proof steps. The formalized Standard Uniform <b>random</b> <b>variable</b> can be transformed to formalize other <b>continuous</b> <b>random</b> <b>variables,</b> such as Uniform, Exponential, Normal, etc., by using various non-uniform random number generation techniques. The formalization of these <b>continuous</b> <b>random</b> <b>variables</b> {{will enable us to}} perform an error free probabilistic analysis of systems within the framework of a higher-order-logic (HOL) theorem prover. For illustration purposes, we present the formalization of the <b>Continuous</b> Uniform <b>random</b> <b>variable</b> based on the formalized Standard Uniform <b>random</b> <b>variable,</b> and then utilize it to perform a simple probabilistic analysis of roundoff error in HOL. c ○ 2007 Elsevier B.

2500|$|A {{continuous}} {{probability distribution}} is a probability distribution {{that has a}} cumulative distribution function that is continuous. [...] Most often they are generated by having a probability density function. Mathematicians call distributions with probability density functions absolutely continuous, since their [...] cumulative distribution function is absolutely continuous {{with respect to the}} Lebesgue measure λ. If the distribution of X is continuous, then X is called a <b>continuous</b> <b>random</b> <b>variable.</b> There are many examples of continuous probability distributions: normal, uniform, chi-squared, and others.|$|E

40|$|Continuous {{probability}} density functions and discrete probability mass functions are tabulated which maximize the differential entropy or absolute entropy, respectively, among all probability distributions with a given L sub p norm (i. e., a given pth absolute moment when p is a finite integer) and unconstrained or constrained value set. Expressions for the maximum entropy are evaluated as {{functions of the}} L sub p norm. The most interesting results are obtained and plotted for unconstrained (real valued) <b>continuous</b> <b>random</b> <b>variables</b> and for integer valued discrete <b>random</b> <b>variables.</b> The maximum entropy expressions are obtained in closed form for unconstrained <b>continuous</b> <b>random</b> <b>variables,</b> {{and in this case}} there is a simple straight line relationship between the maximum differential entropy and the logarithm of the L sub p norm. Corresponding expressions for arbitrary discrete and constrained <b>continuous</b> <b>random</b> <b>variables</b> are given parametrically; closed form expressions are available only for special cases. However, simpler alternative bounds on the maximum entropy of integer valued discrete <b>random</b> <b>variables</b> are obtained by applying the differential entropy results to <b>continuous</b> <b>random</b> <b>variables</b> which approximate the integer valued <b>random</b> <b>variables</b> in a natural manner.
