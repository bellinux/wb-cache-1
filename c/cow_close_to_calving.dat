40|$|Monitoring the {{locomotion}} and posture behaviour {{of pregnant}} <b>cows</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>calving</b> {{is essential in}} determining {{if there is a}} need for human intervention to assist parturition. In this study an automatic real-time monitoring technique is described in detail which allows identifying the locomotion and posturing behaviour of pregnant cows prior <b>to</b> <b>calving.</b> For this purpose video surveillance images of eight cows for the last 24 h prior <b>to</b> their <b>calving</b> were analysed. Data on seven different variables with time were obtained for each cow using an automatic real-time monitor. These were namely: x-y coordinates of the geometrical top view Centre point of the cow; walking trajectory; distance walked; orientation of the main axis; body width/length ratio; hip length and back area. These variables were then used to classify specific behaviours such as standing or lying (including incidences of motion during lying), and eating or drinking. On average 85 % of the standing and lying and 87 % of the eating or drinking behaviour of the eight cows during the last 24 h before calving could be correctly classified. However, the developed technique needs to be further validated with additional tests in the field. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Welfare {{of animals}} in {{livestock}} houses is usually monitored manually by the farmer or ethologists by performing some standardized measures on chosen welfare indicators. Focusing on a single iceberg indicator {{is not sufficient to}} detect welfare by itself. On the other hand, a large set of measures need increased workload on manual observers or stockmen in order to provide a useful indication of an animals quality of life. The objective of this thesis was to show that mathematical modelling and control techniques applied on sensor data lead to more frequent monitoring of health and welfare related responses of livestock animals. Animal responses were monitored with increasing frequency of data sampling, from manual observation once in a growth period to automatic capturing of one data point per second. It was aimed to prove that automated measurements give way to early warning systems as well as prediction of future conditions. In Chapter 2, the welfare of broiler chickens in terms of ease of locomotion was determined by experts going into poultry houses and assessing animals by an animal-based measure called gait score. Measurements were done manually by visual inspections at slaughter age. Assessing at the slaughter age was not an ideal way of monitoring animal welfare on farms. Therefore in chapter 3, measurements were done more frequently once per week during the growth period of the animals. In this chapter thermal comfort of broiler chickens were studied using measurements of a thermal camera. In Chapter 4, measurement frequency was increased to once per second in order to capture the dynamics of the variables under consideration. A camera system was used to detect locomotion and posture parameters of pregnant <b>cows</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>calving.</b> A computer vision technique was developed to monitor the body variables of animals automatically. Images were acquired and analysed giving way to classify specific behaviours related <b>to</b> <b>calving.</b> In Chapter 5, real-time mathematical models were developed to describe the relation of the growth response of a broiler chicken to the feed intake. Weights of broiler chickens were measured by an automatic weighing scale with an increased measurement frequency of ten times per second. Feed intake was also measured continuously by a feeding system. The developed models enabled prediction of future weight responses of animals. In Chapter 6, responses of young chicks to temperature and ventilation changes were studied. Measurements were carried out once per second using a camera. It was shown that the mathematical modelling of dynamic responses not only enabled more frequent welfare assessment and anticipation but also could give an insight to the process of thermo-regulatory behaviour of broiler chicks. In Chapters 7 and 8, continuous weight response and feed intake of animals were used to develop a growth control procedure in an attempt to ensure that the chickens were following a desired growth trajectory. The idea behind was to test the control theory and also to explore the effects of early feed restriction on health, welfare and performance of broiler chickens. It was shown that active control of the growth of broiler chickens in commercial houses was possible. nrpages: 244 status: publishe...|$|R

In herd A, heifers were introduced into existing groups of cows 2 – 4 weeks prior <b>to</b> <b>calving.</b> They were kept in a group housing system with deep bedding. All animals were hornless. In herd B, heifers were kept separated from the cows from 2 – 4 weeks a. p. in a three-row cubicle barn. In contrast to herd A, all animals had horns. The animals´ reactions regarding the milking process and MED were analysed during the first four milkings p. p. We evaluated the correlation between social rank, group size and frequency of group changes in the antepartal period and the occurrence of MED. 12 % of the animals in herd A and 47 % of the animals in herd B showed MED. In herd A, lowranking heifers had significantly more often MED than higher-ranking heifers. A correlation between low rank, increasing strain due to rank order fights and increasing frequency of MED can be assumed here.

40|$|In pasture-based systems, {{cows are}} {{generally}} thinner {{at the end}} of lactation than cows fed total mixed rations and, as a result, over-feeding of metabolizable energy (ME) during the far-off nonlactating period is a standard management policy <b>to</b> achieve optimum <b>calving</b> body condition score (BCS). An alternative would be to manage cows to gain BCS through late lactation, such that <b>cows</b> ended lactation <b>close</b> <b>to</b> optimum <b>calving</b> BCS and maintenance of BCS through <b>to</b> <b>calving.</b> We sought <b>to</b> quantify the effect of moderate or excessive ME intakes during the far-off nonlactating period in cows that had been managed to gain or maintain BCS through late lactation and whether the far-off management strategy interacted with close-up level of feeding. Effects on milk production and circulating indicators of energy balance and metabolic health in early lactation were evaluated. A herd of 150 cows was randomly assigned to 1 of 2 feeding levels in late lactation to achieve a low and high BCS at the time of dry-off (approximately 4. 25 and 5. 0 on a 10 -point scale). Following dry-off, both herds were managed to achieve a BCS of 5. 0 one month before calving; this involved controlled feeding (i. e., maintenance) and over-feeding of ME during the far-off dry period. Within each far-off feeding-level treatment, cows were offered 65, 90, or 120 % of their pre-calving ME requirements for 3 wk pre-calving in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement (i. e., 25 cows/treatment). Body weight and BCS were measured weekly before and after calving, and milk production was measured weekly until wk 7 postcalving. Blood samples were collected weekly for 4 wk pre-calving and 5 wk postcalving, and on d 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 relative <b>to</b> <b>calving,</b> and analyzed for indicators of energy balance (e. g., blood fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate), calcium status, and inflammatory state. No interaction was observed between far-off and close-up feeding levels. Over-feeding of ME to low BCS cows during the far-off nonlactating period reduced blood fatty acid and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations in early lactation, and increased blood albumin to globulin ratio compared with cows that were dried off <b>close</b> <b>to</b> recommended <b>calving</b> BCS and control-fed during the far-off dry period. Cows consuming 65 % of their ME requirements during the close-up period had lower fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyrate in early lactation, but produced less milk, particularly during the first 21 d of lactation, had more than 3 -fold greater concentration of haptoglobin immediately postcalving, and had a lower blood cholesterol concentration and albumin to globulin ratio, when compared with cows offered 90 or 120 % of their ME requirements.

The initial screening targeted breeding herds; 483 cattle were screened using the Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) {{followed by the}} Competitive Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (c-ELISA) as a confirmatory test. The seropositivity on c-ELISA was 28. 95 % in 2005; it subsequently declined to 6. 72 %, 1. 17 %, 0. 16 % and 0. 00 % in 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Brucella seropositivity was not detected in goats. Seropositivity declined following institution of stringent control measures that included: gradual culling of seropositive animals through slaughter; isolation and confinement of pregnant <b>cows</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> calving; proper disposal of placentas and aborted foetuses; {{the use of the}} S 19 vaccine; and restricted introduction of new animals.

40|$|Determination of plasma {{concentrations}} of pregnancy associated glycoproteins (PAG) {{has been used}} for early pregnancy diagnosis in cows. However, this is complicated by the presence of PAG in plasma for an extended period postpartum. The main objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the postpartum elimination rates of pregnancy associated glycoproteins (PAG) in sheep, goats and cows in order to gain background information applicable to the use of PAG for pregnancy diagnosis in domestic ruminants. A second objective was to investigate whether PAG are transferred to the foetus and newborn, by measuring plasma PAG concentrations in calves, lambs and goat kids before and after colostrum feeding. PAG in the blood at parturition were eliminated by a first order process in the cows and ewes, while a two-step log-linear decline occurred in the goats. Estimated postpartum half-life of plasma PAG in the cows and ewes was 9 and 4. 5 days, respectively. In the goats, half-lives were 3. 6 and 7. 5 days in the initial fast and terminal slow phase. Basal levels were reached 80 - 90 days postpartum in cows. Plasma PAG concentration can be used for pregnancy diagnosis from day 28 after AI, provided that the time interval from <b>calving</b> <b>to</b> AI is > 60 days. Using a heterologous antibody RIA, we found 4 ng/mL to be the appropriate cut-off. Due to the presence of PAG residues from the previous gestation, the interval from AI to pregnancy diagnosis should increase by approximately 0. 5 days beyond 28 days for each day of AI <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>calving</b> than 60. Measurements in newborn ruminants suggested that PAG enter the foetal blood in utero and that colostral PAG are transferred to the newborn.

Single-channel geophone data recorded over {{several months in}} 2009 and 2010 are combined with eleven days of direct visual observations of the glacier front. We apply a processing scheme which combines conventional seismic event detection using a sensitive trigger algorithm and unsupervised clustering of all detected signals based on their waveform characteristics by means of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). We are able to distinguish between false detections, instrumental artifacts, and three classes of signals which are, with different degrees of uncertainty, emitted by calving activity. About 10 % of the directly observed <b>calving</b> events <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the geophone (< 1 km) can be correlated with seismic detections. By extrapolating the interpretation of seismic event classes beyond the time period of visual observations, the temporal distribution of glacier-related events shows an increase in event rate in autumn, particularly for the class which is clearly related <b>to</b> iceberg <b>calving.</b> Using the seismic event distribution in this class {{as a proxy for}} the calving rate and measurements of glacier velocity and glacier front position, we discuss the relationship between glacier dynamics and calving processes. On the seasonal time-scale, the well-marked glacier acceleration in spring is not accompanied by an increase in calving related seismicity. With a slowdown in glacier velocity in autumn, however, a remarkable increase in calving related seismicity is observed.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of today’s dairy has increased {{due to the}} growing number of cows per herd and the production of pounds of milk per cow. Increased milk production however has resulted in a reduction of conception rates causing a loss of income for the dairy producer since the dairy industry relies heavily on milk production, which is caused by good conception rates. Many reproductive disorders like dystocia, metritis, endometritis, and retained placenta affect conception rates, and can lead to metabolic diseases like rumen acidosis, milk fever, and displaced abomasums. Recurrent metabolic diseases can eventually lead to culling of the herd. Many of these metabolic disorders can be the cause of poor nutrition and management during the close-up period and after parturition. Cows in the close-up pen undergo many stressors such as temperature fluxuations, overcrowding, moving from pens, changes in ration, decreased dry matter intake, or metabolic disease which causes cortisol to be released from the adrenal gland. Cortisol suppresses the immune system making the animal more susceptible to metabolic and reproductive diseases that can overall impact production. Cortisol levels are also increased by low blood calcium during the close-up period. Overall, it is the dairy producer’s responsibility to have a sufficient management program in place to treat and prevent the reproductive and metabolic diseases of the herd in order to optimize maximum productivity. The management program should work closely with a nutritionist in order to supply an appropriate feeding program for the transition cow when she is <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>calving</b> and after parturition. It is also crucial for the dairy producer to implement a disease treatment and prevention program with their veterinarian and herd managers...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the association between conception and low milk urea or changes in milk urea around artificial insemination (AI). Data were obtained from the French Milk Control Program for a 4 -yr period (2009 - 2012). Milk urea values between 250 and 450 mg/kg (4. 3 and 7. 7 mM) were considered intermediate (I), and values ≤ 150 mg/kg (2. 6 mM) were considered low (L). Milk urea values before and after each AI were allocated into 4 classes representing the dynamics of milk urea (before-after; I-I, I-L, L-I, and L-L). Subclinical ketosis was defined using milk fat and protein contents before AI as proxies. A logistic regression with a Poisson correction and herd as a random variable was then performed on data from Holstein or all breeds of cows. The success of conception was decreased [relative risk (95 % confidence interval) = 0. 96 (0. 94 - 0. 99) ] in low-urea cows compared with intermediate-urea cows after AI; no significant association was found for urea levels before AI. When combining data on urea before and after AI, I-L urea cows exhibited a 5 to 9 % decrease in conception compared with I-I urea cows, and L-I urea cows showed no difference in conception success compared with I-I urea cows. A decreased conception success for L-L urea cows compared with I-I urea cows was observed for the analysis with cows of all breeds.

We used the mosaic of the Radarsat- 1 Antarctica Mapping Project (RAMP) Antarctic Mapping Mission 1 (AMM) to classify the coastline of Antarctica in terms of surface structure patterns <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the <b>calving</b> front. With the aid of an automated edge detection method, complemented by manual control, the surface structures of all ice shelves and glacier tongues around Antarctica were mapped. We found dense and less dense patterns of surface structures unevenly distributed over the ice shelves and ice tongues. Dense surface patterns are frequent on fast flowing ice masses (ice streams), whereas most ice shelves show a dense surface pattern only <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the grounding line. Flow line analyses on ten ice shelves reveal that the time of residence of the ice along a flow path and—associated with it—the healing of surface crevasses can explain the different surface structure distribution <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the grounding line and the calving front on many ice shelves.

However, in transition cows the relation between inflammation and health conditions and the link between PIC, inflammation start, APR, liver function and metabolic state need to be further investigated. Therefore, 10 multiparous cows were studied 4 wk before and after calving. Cows were daily monitored for health status, feed intake (DMI), milk yield, rectal temperature; body weight and BCS were measured every 2 wk. Blood was also frequently sampled and assayed for a wide metabolic and inflammatory (including IL- 1 and IL- 6; ELISA methods) profile. One cow died 3 days after calving and was evaluated separately. The remaining 9 were retrospectively classified into 2 groups according to IL- 6 plasma values peak: less (LOIL, 6 cows) or greater (UP-IL, 3 cows) than 650 pg/ml. Data were analyzed by the MIXED repeated procedure of SAS. Generally, IL- 1 and IL- 6 were already higher 2 - 4 wk before calving, in absence of clinical symptoms.

UP-IL cows suffered more severe diseases (e. g. mastitis), had lower DMI before calving, lost more body reserves and produced less milk. Moreover, UPIL (vs LO-IL) cows showed higher haptoglobin, bilirubin and urea and lower albumin and Zn levels in the wk before and after calving.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and development of}} crevasses provides great insight into the overall dynamics of a calving glacier, in particular because the formation of crevasses reflects glacier stretching, the same process that leads <b>to</b> <b>calving.</b> If a crevasse opens to the water-line then a calving event normally occurs. Thus outlining where and when crevasses form and how fast they open up, can be very important in detecting pre-conditions for calving events. Detecting crevasses from satellite imagery is an efficient way of tracking their movement, but manual techniques for identifying individual features and monitoring their evolution are time-consuming. In addition, most optical data is subject to inconsistent illumination due to time of day or season, long periods of darkness during winter, and cloud cover. High-resolution radar imagery provides an alternative that does not rely on illumination by the sun and is independent of weather constraints.

In a preliminary study of hydrops placentas from SCNT clones v. control <b>cow</b> placentas <b>close</b> <b>to</b> term, we observed a thickening of the endometrial epithelium, which appeared pseudostratified; in addition, the subepithelial endometrial vascular bed consisted of large, rare arterioles with thick basement membranes {{compared with the}} normal capillary bed observed in control animals. The fetal membranes of hydrops placenta from bovine SCNT clones also exhibited macroscopic morphological differences, which included edema, increased membrane thickness, and a gelatinous appearance. All of these morphological differences {{were similar to those}} we have reported for sheep SCNT clones (Palmieri et al. 2007 Placenta 28, 577 – 584). In the search for biomarkers that may indicate abnormal placental development early in pregnancy, placental tissues were collected on day 40 from pregnancies established after transfer of embryos created through SCNT (n = 17) or IVF (n = 6). Nuclear donor cells used to obtain SCNT embryos were those we have previously found to be highly susceptible to hydrops (from 5 to 19...|$|R
40|$|We show {{results from}} a {{positive}} degree-day (PDD) model of Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) surface mass balance (SMB), 1870 – 2012, forced with reanalysis data. The model includes an improved daily temperature parameterization as compared with a previous version and is run at 1 km rather than 5 km resolution. The improvements lead overall to higher SMB with the same forcing data. We also compare our model with results from two regional climate models (RCMs). While there is good qualitative agreement between our PDD model and the RCMs, it usually results in lower precipitation and lower runoff but approximately equivalent SMB: mean 1979 – 2012 SMB (± standard deviation), in Gt a− 1, is 382 ± 78 in the PDD model, compared with 379 ± 101 and 425 ± 90 for the RCMs. Comparison with in situ SMB observations suggests that the RCMs may be more accurate than PDD at local level, in some areas, although the latter generally compares well. Dividing the GrIS into seven drainage basins we show that SMB has decreased sharply in all regions since 2000. Finally we show correlation between runoff <b>close</b> <b>to</b> two <b>calving</b> glaciers and either calving front retreat or calving flux, this being most noticeable from the mid- 1990 s.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to investigate the variation of gene expression in the blood of lactating cows in relation to the genetic merit for productive traits. For the study, 24 Italian Holstein (IH) cows from a single farm and 24 Italian Simmental (IS) cows from a second farm were selected. Cows were in mid-lactation, and farms had similar management and feeding conditions. For each breed, cows were separated into 3 classes of estimated breeding value (EBV) for milk protein yield (EBVp), namely, 8 cows with low EBVp (low group, LG), 8 cows with high EBV (high group, HG), and the 8 <b>cows</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> the median (medium group, MG). Gene expression was measured on blood with a whole transcriptome bovine microarray, and data of LG and HG were expressed relative to MG. The number of differentially expressed genes between the low and high EBVp groups were 443 for IS and 281 for IH cows. The IS cows had a greater number of genes (398 vs. 241 in IH cows) with opposite expression in the high and low EBV groups, compared with the MG. In IS cows, the largest number of pathways affected were within the KEGG subcategories of “energy metabolism,” “lipid metabolism,” nd “metabolism of cofactors and vitamins. ” Furthermore, the “glutathione metabolism” pathway was markedly affected, with GSTM 1 (from glutathione-S-transferase family), GSS (glutathione synthetase), and G 6 PD (glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase) upregulated in the IS HG but down regulated in the IS LG group. The “intestinal immune network for IgA production” pathway had 2 bovine leukocytes antigen (BoLA-DQ) genes, and the B-cell activating factor of the TNF superfamily (TNFSF 13 B) upregulated in the IS LG group and down regulated in the IS HG group. The IH cows had the highest number of affected pathways in the “metabolism” and “organismal systems” categories, the latter with 5 out of 10 subcategories relative to the immune system. Within the “T cell receptor signaling pathway,” the IH HG cows had up regulation of the CD 1 d, CD 4, and CD 3 antigens and down regulation of the NFkB subunit ReLa gene. This study revealed that specific metabolic and immunological pathways are directly related to genetic merit, and could be considered a signature of quantitative selection. Starting from these preliminary observations, the comparison of differentially expressed genes among animals with different EBVp seems a promising approach to unravel molecular response at a blood level associated with productive traits...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, the iceberg size {{distribution}} in Antarctic waters is a recurrent topic. Icebergs are moving sources of freshwater. Their drift and decay {{have an impact}} on the hydrology, circulation and biology of the ocean regions and are needed for a realistic simulation of the ocean dynamics. During the Radarsat- 1 Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) Antarctic Mapping Mission- 1 (AMM- 1) a mosaic of Antarctica and the adjacent ocean zone was compiled from more than 3000 high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The mosaic offered the unique opportunity to determine spatial distributions of icebergs sizes along the entire coastline of Antarctica. A combination of automated iceberg detection and visual control as well as a correction of false detections resulted in identifying nearly 7000 icebergs with areas between 0. 3 and 4717. 7 km 2. Their spatial distribution showed correlations with coastline classes. These classes are based on the spatial distribution of surface features on ice shelves <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the <b>calving</b> front. From the detections and assumed mean iceberg thicknesses, we can calculate the distribution of floating freshwater ice mass within the coastal zone of Antarctica at the time of image acquisitions. For models of ocean dynamics, this dataset offers the opportunity to simulate the freshwater input into the Southern Ocean on a more realistic basis. ...|$|R

50|$|The Jacobites {{opened fire}} on the fort on 20 March and the scheme of attack {{was carried out by}} Mirabelle de Gordon who put the whole weight on artillery, {{employing}} both cannon and 6-inch artillery. On the 22 March, the Jacobites sent a drummer to Captain Scott with a letter requiring him to surrender, but his answer was that he would defend the place to the last extremity. It soon became clear that the two Jacobite firing positions on Sugar Loaf Hill and Cow Hill were too far from the target and on the 23 March a further battery was opened on <b>Cow</b> Hill, but <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the target. The 6-inch guns apparently caused Captain Scott some concern but his gunners were hammering back effectively. It was impossible for the Jacobites to get near to the ramparts of the fort without being seen because the nights were clear and moon-lit. The only chance they had of getting to grips with the enemy was when parties left the fort for water.|$|R
