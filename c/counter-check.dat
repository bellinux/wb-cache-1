He had reconnoitred them in person; spies had been thrown into them, and information collected from deserters. Stony Point having been recently strengthened by the British was now the most important. It was a rocky promontory advancing far into the Hudson, which washed three sides of it. A deep morass, covered at high water, separated it from the mainland, but at low tide might be traversed by a narrow causeway and bridge. The promontory was crowned by strong works, furnished with heavy ordnance, commanding the morass and causeway. Lower down were two rows of abatis, and the shore {{at the foot of}} the hill could be swept by vessels of war anchored in the river. The garrison was about six hundred strong, commanded by Lieutenant-colonel Johnson.|$|E

While the first two classes satisfy a generalized closure property, namely, the complement of an ωB-regular (resp., ωS-regular) language is an ωS-regular (resp., ωB-regular) one, the last class is not closed under complementation. The existence of non-ωBS-regular languages that are the complements of some ωBS-regular ones and express fairly natural properties of reactive systems motivates the search for other well-behaved classes of extended ω-regular languages. In this paper, we introduce the class of ωT-regular languages, that includes meaningful languages which are not ωBS-regular. We first define {{it in terms of}} ωT-regular expressions. Then, we introduce a new class of automata (<b>counter-check</b> automata) and we prove that (i) their emptiness problem is decidable in PTIME and (ii) they are expressive enough to capture ωT-regular languages (whether or not ωT-regular languages are expressively complete with respect to <b>counter-check</b> automata is still an open problem).

40|$|Abstract. Autoradiography is an {{effective}} tool for the imaging of radionuclide distributions in various samples. In sophisticated applications with special prepa-ration and development of sample-emulsion combinations and subsequent grain counts it can be highly quantitative, but it requires carefully controlled conditions {{and a variety of}} <b>counter-checks,</b> for example through scintillation spectroscopy. Less refined applications use X-ray films as detectors, and their seeming simplic-ity tends to invite artefacts and misinterpretations. Particular care needs to be taken, if one deals, or presumes to deal, with the low-energy 13 -emitter tritium. Because of the short electron ranges the film must be in intimate contact with the sample, which tends to produce chemographic artefacts; without added spectro-scopic measurements i is impossible to discriminate the spurious signals from a blackening of the film due to tritium. Recent statements concerning autoradio-graphic tritium measurements in tree samples have created considerable public concern and have demonstrated the pitfalls of uncritical use. This paper presents order-of-magnitude criteria for the detection threshold in the autoradiography of tritium; they can serve as an exclusion principle for some of the more extravagant misinterpretations...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Approximately {{ten million}} {{patients}} in Germany suffer from hypertension, 10 % {{of these patients}} are difficult to medicate, whereas 1 % requires long-term blood pressure monitoring. The purpose of our study is the empirical evaluation of a novel monitoring system recording blood pressure, pulse rate and body temperature of hypertensive patients which is designed for minimally-invasive implantation into the femoral artery. Methods The device is tested in twelve chronic animal trials (sheep) {{for a period of}} three to six months. Implantation of the sensor is accomplished by means of a dedicated sheath (PASIS) in the femoral artery under X-ray-control. A reference sensor positioned contra laterally is used to <b>counter-check</b> the measurement quality and validity of each sensor after implantation. Position and proper functioning of the sensor are controlled via regular readout measurements and CTs. Pathologic evaluation are made to investigate possible ingrowth of sensor tip and sensor cable {{at the end of each}} trial. Results Although the project is still in process, several interesting findings can already be reported. The pressure sensors in general deliver stable pressure history. However, the stiffness of the micro-cable as well as the implantation technique and position have an important impact on stable positioning of the sensor in the artery and thus on the validity of the pressure curves. Cables with low stability tend to slip out of the artery easily whereas high stiffness may injure the vessel. Conclusion Achieved findings are promising and support the feasibility of a stable long-term blood pressure implant to monitor hypertensive patients. However, there are still some challenges to overcome. Future work encompasses to analyze the influence of different cable designs and implantation techniques as well as the validation of ingrowth and explantabilit...|$|E

40|$|Seismic Studies Center, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi ArabiaTwo {{magnitude}} formulas to {{be applied}} in seismic parameter determinations were developed for the seismographic sub-network in NW Saudi Arabia: ML = Log (A / T) + 3. 4 Log D + 2. 55 and Mc = 2. 55 Log (t) - 2. 15. These formulas were empirically determined through magnitude calibration of the amplitude and total trace duration data ~m the seismic stations of the network. The relationship found between coda magnitude (Mc). duration, and tlistance indicates negligible correction factor for epicentral distance of earthquake events less than 1000 km from the network making it compatible to use with the adapted local magnitude scale (ML) for better estimate of earthquake magnitude values. These findings make the twp magnitude scales supplementary {{to each other and}} their complimentary roles could possibly cover a wider area in the observation of earthquake events in the eastern Mediterranean region. Both magnitude scales give good fits with standard error of 0. 16 for ML and 0. 12 for Mc.

40|$|The poor {{status of}} sewer pipes in North America has been {{reported}} by many researchers, revealing the presence of many defects that impact their performance. Inadequate inspection is considered {{as one of the}} main causes behind the declining condition of this class of pipes. This could be attributed to high cost of inspection and inadequate funds allocated to this purpose. The high cost is due to the current manual and high labor intensive inspection practice. Sewer rehabilitation methods are numerous and are constantly being developed. One of the rapidly expanding fields in the sewer rehabilitation industry is trenchless technology. Due to the large number of methods associated with this field, selecting the most suitable method manually can be a challenging task. Selection in this environment may also suffer from the limited knowledge and/or experience of the decision-maker. This research presents two developed automated systems: AUTO-DETECT and AUTO-SELECT. AUTO-DETECT detects and classifies defects in sewer pipes automatically. The system utilizes image analysis techniques, artificial intelligence (AI) and Visual Basic programming language for performing its task. A multiple classifier module encompassing a total of fifteen classifiers was developed to <b>counter-check</b> the results generated by the system. A solution strategy was also developed for efficient utilization of the developed specialized classifiers in an effort to improve the system's performance. The automated system was validated using actual data from randomly selected sections of the sewer network of a major Canadian municipality. The system's accuracy was found to range from 80 % to 100 %. AUTO-SELECT is essentially a multi-attribute decision support system designed to select and rank the most suitable trenchless rehabilitation methods for sewer pipes. The system utilizes two modules: (1) database management system (DBMS) and (2) decision support system (DSS). The developed relational database assists in identifying suitable trenchless rehabilitation techniques that satisfy a total of sixteen factors which account for technical, contractual and cost requirements of projects as well as user specified preferences. In case of having more than one suitable rehabilitation method, a DSS was developed to evaluate and rank them and, accordingly, suggest the most suitable one. A case example has been worked out to demonstrate the use and capabilities of the developed system...|$|E
60|$|The first {{design of}} this kind was formed in the session of the year 1773.

But it does not appear that the body of regulations enacted in that year, that is, in the East India Act of the thirteenth of his Majesty's reign, were altogether grounded on that information, but were adopted rather on probable speculations and general ideas of good policy and good government. New establishments, civil and judicial, were therefore formed at a very great expense, and with much complexity of constitution.

So that, if the act has not fully answered its purposes, the failure cannot be attributed to any want of officers of every description, or to the deficiency of any mode of patronage in their appointment.

40|$|Background: Pharmacists are {{considered}} medication experts but are underutilised mainly at {{the periphery of}} the primary healthcare team. General medical practitioners (GPs) in Malaysian private healthcare clinics are granted rights to prescribe and dispense medications, thus furhter limiting pharmacists involvement in ensuring safe use of medicines. The integration of pharmacist into private primary healthcare clinics has the potential to reduce medication-relation problems. Objective: To explore the views of consumers on the integration of pharmacists within private primary healthcare clinics in Malaysia. Method: A purposive sample of healthcare consumers in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia were invited to participate in focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Sessions were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed using NVivo 10. Results: A total of 24 healthcare consumers particpated in two focus groups and six semi-structured interviews. Four major themes were identified: (1) Pharmacists role viewed mainly as supplying medications, (2) Readiness to accept pharmacists in private healthcare clinics, (3) Willingness to pay for pharmacy services, and (4) Concerns about GPs resistance to pharmacist integration. Consumers felt that a pharmacist integrated into private prumary healthcare clinics could offer potential benefits such as <b>counter-checking</b> prescriptions to ensure correct medication is supplied and counselling consumers on their medications and the potential side effects. The potential to increase in costs to consumers and GPs reluctance were perceived as barriers to integration. Conclusion: This study provides insights into consumers perspectives on the roles of pharmacists within private primary healthcare clinics in Malaysia. Consumers generally supported pharmacist integration into private primary healthcare clinics. However, for pharmacists to expand their capacity in providing integrated and collaborative primary care services to consumers, barriers to pharmacist integration need to be addressed...|$|R

These insulin-mimetic tests have also been carried out with non-transformed human fibroblasts (cell line F 26). The compounds under investigation comprise established insulin-mimetic species such as vanadate ([H 2 VO 4] –), [VO(acetylacetonate) 2], [VO 2 (dipicolinate) ] – and [VO(maltolate) 2], and new systems and coordination compounds containing OO, ON, OS, NS and ONS donor atom sets. A vitality test assay, measuring the reduction equivalents released in the mitochondrial respiratory chain by intracellular glucose degradation, is introduced and the results are <b>counter-checked</b> with 3 H-labelled glucose. Most compounds are toxic at the 1 mM concentration level, and most compounds are essentially non-toxic and about as effective as or more potent than insulin at concentrations of 0. 01 mM and below. V V compounds tend to be less toxic than V IV compounds, and complexes containing thio functional ligands are somewhat more toxic thanoth ers.

They are not the least staggered by the appalling reality of the Duke of Westminster or the Duke of Sutherland; not the least staggered by the sinister power of a conspiracy of coal-owners to paralyse a great nation with the horrors of a fuel famine. But they are staggered by their bogey that State ownership of land might {{give rise to a}} certain amount of jobbery and corruption on the part of officials. They think it better that the dukes and the squires should get all the rent than that the State should get most of it, with the possibility of a percentage being corruptly embezzled by the functionaries who manage it. This shows want of imagination. It is as though one should say to one's clerk, [...] "All your income shall be paid in future to the Duke of Westminster, and not to yourself, for his sole use and benefit; because we, your employers, are afraid that if we give you your salary in person, you may let some of it be stolen from you or badly invested." [...] How transparently absurd! We want our income ourselves, to spend as we please. We would rather risk losing one per cent. of it in bad investments than let all be swallowed up by the dukes and the landlords.|$|R

This Mr Dorrit (his name is Dorrit) had incurred a responsibility to us, ages before the fairy {{came out of the}} Bank and gave him his fortune, under a bond he had signed for the performance of a contract which was not at all performed. He was a partner in a house in some large way--spirits, or buttons, or wine, or blacking, or oatmeal, or woollen, or pork, or hooks and eyes, or iron, or treacle, or shoes, or something or other that was wanted for troops, or seamen, or somebody--and the house burst, and we being among the creditors, detainees were lodged {{on the part of the}} Crown in a scientific manner, and all the rest Of it. When the fairy had appeared and he wanted to pay us off, Egad we had got into such an exemplary state of checking and <b>counter-checking,</b> signing and counter-signing, that it was six months before we knew how to take the money, or how to give a receipt for it. It was a triumph of public business,' said this handsome young Barnacle, laughing heartily, 'You never saw such a lot of forms in your life. [...] "Why," [...] the attorney said to me one day, [...] "if I wanted this office to give me two or three thousand pounds instead of take it, I couldn't have more trouble about it." [...] "You are right, old fellow," [...] I told him, [...] "and in future you'll know that we have something to do here."' The pleasant young Barnacle finished by once more laughing heartily. He was a very easy, pleasant fellow indeed, and his manners were exceedingly winning.|$|R
