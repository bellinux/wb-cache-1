40|$|Efficient use of {{material}} {{is an important factor}} in achieving economical and sustainable structures. Typically, annealed austenitic stainless steel has a material strength of around 220 N/mm 2, somewhat lower than that of common structural carbon steel grades. This lower strength, coupled with the higher material cost, puts stainless steel at a significant disadvantage when considering material selection, despite its other desirable properties. However, the strength of stainless steel may, at relatively low expense, be considerably enhanced through modification of the chemical composition and through the process of cold working due to the strain hardening nature of the material. This strength enhancement has not generally been utilised in practice due to a lack of knowledge on the structural behaviour of this high-strength material. Given the high material cost of stainless steel, the need to optimise the efficiency of design methods and to develop the performance, availability and diversity of the current product range is clear. To this end, this paper describes tests, numerical modelling and the development of design guidance for high-strength stainless-steel members in a range of structural configurations. Material tensile <b>tests,</b> <b>member</b> <b>tests</b> in <b>compression</b> and <b>member</b> <b>tests</b> in bending have been described. The results of the tests have been successfully replicated numerically, and subsequent sensitivity studies and parametric studies have been performed. Test and numerical results have been compared against two design methods developed for standard-strength material (Eurocode 3 Part 1. 4 and the deformation capacity based design method). The comparisons have revealed that both design methods provide a similar level of reliability to that offered for standard-strength material, and thus, extension of both design methods to the high-strength grades has been recommended...|$|R

In this paper, the analytical procedures of hybrid concrete filled FRP tube flexural members are suggested based on the CFT design method.

Beam compared with shell type of Finite Element (FE) models varied in slenderness ratio and initial distortion are used to assess the accuracy of present numerical results. The comparison of result between FE models and design strength formulations in some specifications are used to assess the ultimate strength formulations of bridge specifications according to the behavior of current steel <b>compression</b> <b>members.</b> It can be observed from numerical results that FE models and design strength by JSHB 2012 and AISC 2005 /AASHTO 2010 have good agreement each other which means that the specifications have good capability in assessing the ultimate strength of steel <b>compression</b> <b>members.</b> Parametric study of the ultimate strain varied in slenderness ratio and load versus displacement curves of <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> are also introduced in order to perform more detail steel columns displacement behaviour.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The Southern African Institute of Steel Construction {{expressed}} concern {{with regard to}} the unit definition of the effective length factor, K, stipulated for compressive elements of parallel chord trusses in Clause 15 of SANS 10162 - 1 : 2005 - Limit state design of hot-rolled steelwork. The simplified method for truss design specified in the code assumes all <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> are pin-connected, which allows for greater design simplicity and reduces the amount of code interpretation required by the designer. In addition to this, Clause 15 requires the additional reduction in resistance of the first web <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> by a factor of 0. 85. However, this approach may be considered overly conservative and in current design practice the effective length factor is often reduced to less than 1. 0. This research investigates the effective length factor of web <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> in parallel chord trusses, by means of investigative structural analyses of representative trusses using ANGELINE and Prokon analytical programs, and by designing, constructing and testing six representative trusses, using current design practices. A comparative study of a number of different countries’ codified approaches to truss design is also included. The structural analyses revealed that in-plane buckling of the web <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> was the consistent mode of failure, however at a much greater applied load than the design load determined according to SANS 10162 - 1 : 2005. Contrary to the expected mode of failure, all six tests performed on the representative trusses exhibited elastic out-of-plane buckling, or strongaxis buckling, of the web <b>compression</b> <b>members,</b> but still at a much greater applied load than the design load. The unexpected out-of-plane buckling of the web members is due to the inplane stiffness of the end connections used. In order to stay true to current design practice, gusset plates and longitudinal welds were used to join the web members to the chords. The stiffness of the gusset plates therefore significantly reduced the effective length of the web <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> in-plane, but did not reduce the effective length out-of-plane. Despite the unanticipated behaviour of the tests performed, certain conclusions can still be drawn from the results. The unit definition of the effective length factor for in-plane buckling of web <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> is too conservative and a K factor of 0. 8 is recommended. In addition to this an effective length factor for out-plane-buckling of web <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> of 1. 1 is recommended for trusses with welded connections. The necessity of the reduction in resistance of 0. 85 of the first web <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> requires further investigation. The most important conclusion to be drawn is that out-of-plane buckling of web <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> can be the dominant failure mode, which is not taken into consideration in current design practice...|$|R
30|$|Yielding, local {{buckling}}, distortional buckling, global buckling {{and interactive}} failure of these modes {{may affect the}} strength and behaviour of the cold-formed steel (CFS) section under compression. Conventionally, the effective width method (EWM) was {{more familiar with the}} design of CFS <b>compression</b> <b>members.</b> However, EWM involves tedious and iterative calculations for the design of CFS <b>compression</b> <b>members.</b> Therefore, the direct strength method (DSM) has been recently included in the North American Specification (AISI- 2007) for the design of CFS <b>compression</b> <b>members.</b> The interactive buckling modes decrease the strength of the member to a value below the strength under the independent buckling modes. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the accuracy of the DSM for the interactive failure.|$|R

40|$|The word {{tensegrity}} is a {{contraction of}} tensional integrity. In simple structural terms, tensegrity systems are self-stressed pin-jointed networks. Each node receives {{at least one}} strut (<b>compression</b> <b>member)</b> and three cables (tension members). Tension members are thus prestressed against adjoining <b>compression</b> <b>members.</b> This is a pure form of tensegrity where only <b>compression</b> and tension <b>members</b> co-exist to form free-standing structures requiring minimum anchorage system compared with conventional types of structures. Double layer tensegrity systems are interesting because the <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> are relatively short, making the network quite rigid and compact. In the non-prestressed state, the system could be easily deployed. The present paper reviews limited research so far conducted at Coventry University on double layer tensegrity networks. It also reviews future directions in research into this fascinating field {{that has yet to}} be fully explored and exploited to find proper applications for it in the civil engineering discipline...|$|R
40|$|Cold-formed steel {{members have}} been widely used in {{residential}} and commercial buildings as primary load bearing structural elements. They are often made of thin steel sheets and hence they are more susceptible to local buckling. The buckling behaviour of cold-formed steel <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> under fire conditions is not fully investigated yet and hence {{there is a lack of}} knowledge on the fire performance of cold-formed steel <b>compression</b> <b>members.</b> Current cold-formed steel design standards do not provide adequate design guidelines for the fire design of cold-formed steel <b>compression</b> <b>members.</b> Therefore a research project based on extensive experimental and numerical studies was undertaken to investigate the local buckling behaviour of light gauge cold-formed steel <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> under simulated fire conditions. First a series of 91 local buckling tests was conducted at ambient and uniform elevated temperatures up to 700 oC on cold-formed lipped and unlipped channels. Suitable finite element models were then developed to simulate the behaviour of tested columns and were validated using test results. All the ultimate load capacity results for local buckling were compared with the predictions from the available design rules based on AS/NZS 4600, BS 5950 Part 5, Eurocode 3 Parts 1. 2 and 1. 3 and the direct strength method (DSM), based on which suitable recommendations have been made for the fire design of cold-formed steel <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> subject to local buckling at uniform elevated temperatures.

40|$|Current design {{standards}} {{do not provide}} adequate guidelines for the fire design of cold-formed steel <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> subject to flexural-torsional buckling. Eurocode 3 Part 1. 2 (2005) recommends the same fire design guidelines for both hot-rolled and cold-formed steel <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> subject to flexural-torsional buckling although considerable behavioural differences exist between cold-formed and hot-rolled steel members. Past research has recommended the use of ambient temperature cold-formed steel design rules for the fire design of cold-formed steel <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> provided appropriately reduced mechanical properties are used at elevated temperatures. To assess the accuracy of flexural-torsional buckling design rules in both ambient temperature cold-formed steel design and fire {{design standards}}, an experimental study of slender cold-formed steel <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> was undertaken at both ambient and elevated temperatures.

Suitable recommendations have been made in relation to the currently available design rules for flexural-torsional buckling including methods of improvement.

40|$|In this study, the {{structural}} behaviour of cold-formed steel built-up <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> with longitudinal stiffeners was investigated by experiments and numerical simulation. The influence of different screw spacings on the ultimate strengths of built-up <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> was also investigated. In current design specifications, generally {{there are no}} direct and explicit design rules for cold-formed steel built-up sections. Therefore, design rules for built-up open sections and closed sections have been proposed. The test program was conducted for cold-formed steel built-up sections, which were compressed axially between fixed ends with various column lengths ranged from 300 to 3200 mm. Two identical open sections were connected by self-tapping screws to form a built-up section. The material properties and initial geometric imperfections of the test specimens were measured. The experimental investigation consisted of built-up open sections with edge and web stiffeners, and built-up closed sections with inward or outward web stiffeners. In total, 47 specimens were tested with a screw spacing of 100 mm, and another 25 specimens were tested with screw spacings of 300 and 600 mm. A further investigation on {{the structural}} behaviour of cold-formed steel built-up <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> was performed using finite element analysis (FEA). Firstly, accurate and reliable finite element models (FEMs) were developed and verified against the test results. Secondly, extensive parametric studies of cross-section geometry and the screw spacing were {{carried out by the}} verified FEMs. The parametric study contained 442 specimens for built-up open sections, built-up closed sections, and built-up sections with different screw spacings. Therefore, the complex structural behaviour of built-up <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> with edge and web stiffeners, together with different spacings of self-tapping screws were studied thoroughly, as reported in this thesis. The current direct strength method (DSM) is a favored design method for cold-formed steel columns and beams due to its ease of calculation. However, DSM does not cover the design of cold-formed steel built-up sections. The appropriateness of DSM for cold-formed steel built-up <b>compression</b> <b>members</b> was accessed by both experimental and numerical investigation. It was found that the current DSM is not quite suitable for the design of built-up <b>compression</b> <b>members.</b> Therefore, the current DSM was modified for built-up open and closed sections. The results show that the modified design rules are generally conservative and reliable for the design of built-up <b>compression</b> <b>members.</b> In addition, design recommendations are proposed for built-up sections with different screw spacings.
