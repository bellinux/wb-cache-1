40|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} a stretchable radio frequency (RF) sensor to detect strain direction and level. The stretchable sensor is composed of two complementary split ring resonators (CSRR) with microfluidic channels.

Microfluidic channels are built by Ecoflex elastomer and microfluidic <b>channel</b> <b>frames.</b> A three-dimensional (3 D) printer is used for fabrication of microfluidic <b>channel</b> <b>frames.</b> Two CSRR resonators are designed to resonate 2. 03 GHz and 3. 68 GHz. When the proposed sensor is stretched from 0 to 8 mm along the +x direction, the resonant frequency is shifted from 3. 68 GHz to 3. 13 GHz. When the proposed sensor is stretched from 0 to 8 mm along the −x direction, the resonant frequency is shifted from 2. 03 GHz to 1. 78 GHz. Therefore, we can detect stretched length and direction from independent variation of two resonant frequencies...|$|R

5000|$|FICON uses two Fibre Channel exchanges for {{a channel}} control unit {{connection}} {{one for each}} direction. So while a Fibre Channel exchange is capable of carrying a command and response on a single exchange, and all other FC-4 protocols work that way, the response to a FICON IU is always on a different exchange from the IU {{to which it is}} a response. The two exchanges that implement a connection are called an exchange pair (Note that the concept of the two exchanges being related exists only at the FC-4 layer). While other FC-4s have a single [...] "data structure type" [...] code that characterizes their IUs in Fibre <b>Channel</b> <b>frame</b> headers, FICON has two.

The engine remained at 970cc and was fitted with an Eisemann magneto and Claudel carburettor. The clutch was a leather lined cone type fitted into the external flywheel.

50|$|The next {{models that}} {{followed}} the Cub Cadet Original were the Cub Cadet 70 and 100. International designed the Cub Cadet 70 and 100 because of requests from customers to build a tougher tractor. International responded to these requests by incorporating a two <b>channel</b> <b>frame,</b> called the narrow frame, inside which the engine sat. The new frame allowed the flywheel on the engine to be directly {{in line with the}} drive shaft eliminating the need for a belt to drive the three speed transmission. Therefore, the Cub Cadet model 70 and 100 was the first true shaft driven Cub Cadet. The Cub Cadet 70 was a direct replacement to the original which still contained the seven horsepower Kohler engine. The model 100 offered the same features as the model 70; the only difference was it had a ten-horsepower Kohler engine instead of the seven horsepower engine. Round fenders, headlights, and a creeper gear were all examples of options that could be had on the model 70 and 100. Production of the Cub Cadet 70 and 100 ranged from 1963 to 1965.|$|E
50|$|Production of the 3-wheeled Mechanical Horse {{commenced}} in 1934. The design {{had been}} refined in 1933 by Oliver Danson North, who modified the original prototype. This featured automatic trailer coupling {{and the single}} front wheel could be steered through 360 degrees. This was a very simple and sturdy vehicle which was constructed on a steel <b>channel</b> <b>frame</b> and fitted with a wooden cab, the early versions having canvas doors. The Mechanical Horse came in two sizes, capable of carrying loads of three tons and six tons, {{each of the two}} sizes had a corresponding coupling size, which became known as the 3-ton and the 6-ton coupling. The tractor units were powered by Scammell's own side valve petrol engine of 1125cc in the 3 ton version and 2043cc in the larger 6 tonner. The engine was offset {{to the left of the}} cab, which could cause stability problems in some circumstances. The vehicles had manoeuvrability which was unmatched; it was possible to turn through 360 degrees in under 20 feet with a 16-foot trailer. The road speed of about 20 mph suited the vehicle to local deliveries, and fuel consumption of 10 to 20 mpg was acceptable. Railway companies were the primary customers for the Mechanical Horse, but they were also used by a number of private companies, particularly breweries, who valued the nimble little lorries. The British armed forces used them in stores and on aircraft carriers. The 6-ton coupling equipment was also fitted to popular makes of lorry such as Bedford, Thornycroft and Austin. Bedford tractor units so equipped were sold under the Bedford-Scammell brand. Such was the popularity and success of the Mechanical Horse that there was a separate sales department using dealers for this unique machine. During the difficult trading years of the 1930s the threewheeler was the saviour of Scammell Lorries Ltd.|$|E
