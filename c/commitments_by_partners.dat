30|$|These {{concerns}} are particularly pertinent {{within the context}} of the TPP Agreement, which has been positioned as a “model” for the twenty-first century implying that similar provisions are likely to appear in future trade Agreements, including those involving developing countries. The analysis of TPP commitments suggests that the Agreement reaffirms participating countries’ commitment to the WTO’s 2001 Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and public health. It is interesting to note that the TPP does include a specific chapter with commitments that have implications for the health sector. The TPP Agreement, however, includes specific <b>commitments</b> <b>by</b> <b>partners</b> on pharmaceuticals-related provisions, which relate to the development of innovative medicines and availability of generic medicines, and in fact provides for stronger protection of IP. The IP chapter also includes commitments on the protection of undisclosed tests and other data submitted to obtain marketing approval of a new pharmaceutical or agricultural chemical product. However, no linkage between low tariffs on agricultural products and health linkage has been deliberated upon in the Agreement. Ongoing TTIP talks, between the EU and USA, do not explicitly highlight the link between lower tariffs and implications on health policy from information available in the public domain.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} {{commitment to}} the EAC customs union protocol. In contrast to previous studies, this research compares state preferences at the negotiation stage with their adherence to each provision in the protocol during the transposition, enforcement and application stages of the protocol. Based on data from fifty semi-structured interviews plus secondary sources, the analysis reveals that partner states are more successful at adhering to the customs related- than trade related provisions in the protocol. Drawing on enforcement, management and constructivist approaches in integration literature, the research identifies three factors that explain inadequate <b>commitment</b> <b>by</b> <b>partner</b> states: {{the weakness of the}} EAC secretariat’s monitoring and sanctioning system, strategic preferences of partner states to protect domestic business interests, and overlapping membership to multiple regional arrangements with different rules which affects adequate interpretation and compliance with the protocol. The findings call for more attention to the concept of ‘completeness’ of transposition and show that a disaggregated level of analysis that takes the preferences of partner states at the negotiation stage into consideration better accounts for the inadequate commitment to regional directives. The findings call for larger multi-sectoral case studies and include assessment of the design of regional arrangements. ...|$|R

40|$|Sponsorship {{has become}} a core issue in sport {{marketing}} and a critical concern for event management. It is now {{an integral part of}} major events and involves an ongoing <b>commitment</b> <b>by</b> Olympic <b>partners</b> who need {{to find new ways to}} gain the maximum returns from their investment. Complementary promotions with tourism organisations of the host country represent one such opportunity. There is also growing recognition that service delivery by tourism and hospitality industries may determine the success of many sponsor activities, such as guest hospitality programs. The dynamic nature of Olympic sponsorship is reviewed in the context of the marketing policy framework of the International Olympic Committee. Factors affecting sponsorship at the Sydney 2000 Games are considered with reference to AMP, Ansett Australia, and Visa. It is shown that tourism organisations can play a more active role in attracting sponsors and achieving positive outcomes for the host country. ...|$|R

This paper uses a multi-actor analysis, in order to explore the critical success factors (CSFs) for sound implementation of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the port context, and to determine the diverging opinions of stakeholders with regard to the importance of these CSFs. The results indicate that eight CSFs are of superior importance in port PPPs: the concreteness and preciseness of the concession agreement, the ability to appropriately allocate and share risk, the technical feasibility of the project, the <b>commitment</b> made <b>by</b> <b>partners,</b> the attractiveness of the financial package, a clear definition of responsibilities, the presence of a strong private consortium and a realistic cost/benefit assessment.

Cook cited {{that it was}} unlikely that the channel could sustain [...] "acceptable profitability" [...] long-term and the four partner companies had internal disagreements over the channel's operation. In addition, Spotlight had suffered from relatively limited national carriage throughout its existence as it was available exclusively to cable systems owned by Dimension, Storer, TCI and Cox, limiting the number of potential subscribers to the service. Cook noted that reaching distribution and marketing agreements with other providers would have been too cost-prohibitive to execute; and that the venture {{would not have been able}} to make justifiable expenditures to make licensing fee bids to major film studios that were competitive with those submitted by established pay services for the rights to certain films, commit to pre-production financing and finance the production of original made-for-cable films for the channel without a bigger financial <b>commitment</b> <b>by</b> the <b>partners.</b>|$|R

40|$|The Government of the Republic of Zambia has prioritised the {{national}} response to HIV and AIDS. To this end, it has placed emphasis on mainstreaming HIV and AIDS into {{the national}} development agenda. This {{is evidenced by the}} prominence that HIV and AIDS have been given in critical national documents such as the Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP). Government has also continued to devote resources to the response and is grateful for the continuing support of its cooperating partners in the response. The cooperation demonstrates that we need to work together if we are to make significant progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Our Republican President has stated that Government has already taken steps to reduce the socio-economic impact through support for reduced discrimination and mobilisation of local and foreign resources to combat the disease. We need to ensure that we obtain value for money from the resources that we continue to deploy towards the fight against HIV and AIDS. It behoves us, therefore, to ensure that we have a sound resource management and tracking system.

5000|$|Local timber millers Frederick Gladwell and Robert Greathead {{decided to}} {{construct}} a central mill that would process cane {{from a number of}} surrounding farms. Buhot was engaged to design the mill complex and supervise the production of sugar. In July 1866 tender notices were placed in the Maryborough Chronicle for the manufacture of 50,000 bricks for mill buildings and for the erection of a [...] "New Sugar Manufactory". John Murray undertook the brickwork, stone flooring was quarried locally and machinery was obtained from Sydney. By September, wharves were constructed on the riverbank below the refinery in order to accommodate sugar cane punts. Vessels carrying goods to and from the Central Mill also used the wharves. A large cutting was made in the riverbank for a rail line between the mill and the river. This was operated by a rope and windlass to transport goods and equipment up and down the embankment. Written agreements were obtained from local farmers regarding the supply of cane. It was a major <b>commitment</b> <b>by</b> both the <b>partners</b> and the farmers producing the [...] "new" [...] crop.|$|R
40|$|Background Neglected {{tropical}} diseases (NTDs) predominantly {{occur in}} resource poor settings where they often present a serious public health burden. Sustained global advocacy has been important in raising awareness of NTDs {{and the relatively}} low cost for control of helminthic NTDs using preventive chemotherapy. This enthusiasm was boosted at the London declaration on NTDs in 2012 through <b>commitments</b> <b>by</b> different <b>partners</b> to avail resources required for control of NTDs particularly those that employ preventive chemotherapy as the major intervention strategy. Subsequently, national NTD programmes are responding to these new opportunities by implementing preventive chemotherapy including school-based deworming (SBD). Further, with the availability of increased resources, both financial and pharma, the optimal strategies for implementing preventive chemotherapy in highly endemic settings are under debate and this paper goes some way to addressing this issue in a specific setting in coastal Kenya. Methods We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study in Matuga District, Kwale County, Kenya to evaluate the effect of school-based co-administration of praziquantel and albendazole against urogenital schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections. A total of 1022 school children in 5 study schools were tested for the infections in urine and stool samples during a baseline survey in September 2009. The presence of Schistosoma haematobium infection {{was determined by the}} urine filtration method while STH infections were determined by Kato-Katz technique. Results Urogenital schistosomiasis and hookworm infection were the major parasitic infections among the children in the study area. There was significant decrease in both prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium infection after treatment but varying levels of rebound were observed during the period between the treatments. The school-based treatment, however, did not have any significant effect on both the prevalence and intensity of hookworm infection. Conclusions Once per year SBD programmes may not be adequate for controlling hookworm infection and urogenital schistosomiasis in rural areas of Kwale County. There is a need to consider expanded preventive chemotherapy strategies that will allow inclusion of the adult populations. Community-based health education campaigns focusing on increasing household latrine ownership and use, as a complementary measure to control STH and urogenital schistosomiasis in similar settings, may also be useful...|$|R
