5|$|Analyses since 2001 have {{concluded}} that Eumetazoa (more complex than sponges) are {{more closely related to}} particular groups of sponges than {{to the rest of the}} sponges. Such conclusions imply that sponges are not monophyletic, because the last common ancestor of all sponges would also be a direct ancestor of the Eumetazoa, which are not sponges. A study in 2001 based on <b>comparisons</b> <b>of</b> ribosome DNA concluded that the most fundamental division within sponges was between glass sponges and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are more closely related to calcareous sponges, those with calcium carbonate spicules, than to other types of sponge. In 2007 one analysis based on <b>comparisons</b> <b>of</b> RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass sponges are more closely related to each other than either is to calcareous sponges, which in turn are more closely related to Eumetazoa.|$|E

5|$|Histological {{examination}} {{reveals that}} pachycephalosaurid domes {{are composed of}} a unique form of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that {{play a critical role}} in wound healing, and are capable of rapidly depositing bone during remodeling. Peterson et al.

CT scan <b>comparisons</b> <b>of</b> the skulls of Stegoceras validum, Prenocephale prenes, and several head-striking artiodactyls have also supported pachycephalosaurids as being well-equipped for head-butting.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 it was {{proposed}} that large theropods like Tyrannosaurus had teeth covered in lips like modern day lizards, {{rather than having}} bare teeth like crocodiles. This {{was based on the}} presence of enamel, which according to this theory, may have to remain hydrated, an issue not faced by aquatic species like crocodilians or toothless species like birds, which have lipless mouths and toothless beaks. Based on <b>comparisons</b> <b>of</b> bone texture of Daspletosaurus with crocodilians, a 2017 theory suggests that Tyrannosaurus and other tyrannosaurids may not have had lips at all and instead had large, flat scales that left no room for lips. The skull of Daspletosaurus also suggests that tyrannosaurids including Tyrannosaurus had integumentary sensory organs similar to crocodilians likely used in touch, temperature readings, prey detection and precise control of jaw movements.|$|E

Another possible function is that the plates may have helped the animal increase heat absorption from the sun. Since a cooling trend occurred {{towards the end of the}} Jurassic, a large ectothermic reptile might have used the increased surface area afforded by the plates to absorb radiation from the sun.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal's parent company, Arsenal Holdings plc, {{operates}} as a non-quoted public limited company, whose ownership is considerably {{different from that of}} other football clubs. Only 62,219 shares in Arsenal have been issued, and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the FTSE or AIM; instead, they are traded relatively infrequently on the ICAP Securities and Derivatives Exchange, a specialist market. On 29 May 2017, a single share in Arsenal had a mid price of £18,000, which sets the club's market capitalisation value at approximately £1,119.9m. Most football clubs aren't listed on an exchange, which makes direct <b>comparisons</b> <b>of</b> their values difficult. Consultants Brand Finance valued the club's brand and intangible assets at $703m in 2015, and consider Arsenal an AAA global brand.
