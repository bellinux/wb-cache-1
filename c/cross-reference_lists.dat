40|$|Objective: To review {{information}} regarding the association of physical activity (PA) with quality of life (QoL) in the elderly and to identify the study designs and measurement instruments most commonly used in its assessment, in the period 2000 - 2012. Methods: Relevant articles were identified by a search of four electronic databases and <b>cross-reference</b> <b>lists</b> and by contact with {{the authors of the}} included manuscripts. Original studies on the association between PA and QoL in individuals aged 60 years or older were examined. The quality of studies as well as the direction and the consistency of the association between PA and QoL were evaluated. Results: A total of 10, 019 articles were identified as potentially relevant, but only 42 (0. 42 %) met the inclusion criteria and were retrieved and examined. Most studies demonstrated a positive association between PA and QoL in the elderly. PA had a consistent association with the following QoL domains: functional capacity; general QoL; autonomy; past, present and future activities; death and dying; intimacy; mental health; vitality; and psychological. Conclusion: PA was positively and consistently associated with some QoL domains among older individuals, supporting the notion that promoting PA in the elderly may have an impact beyond physical health. However, the associations between PA and other QoL domains were moderate to inconsistent and require further investigation...|$|E

40|$|Many {{companies}} that implement ISO 14001 have an existing quality management system, such as ISO 9001, QS- 9000 or TS- 16949. Some {{of these companies}} want to combine the two systems. Does this make sense? Is there a best way to integrate the two systems? The ISO 14001 standard has an appendix that includes a cross-reference matrix identifying common elements of the environmental management system standard and the quality management system standard. This <b>cross-reference</b> <b>list</b> was developed and released with the standard, before any company had tried to integrate the two systems. The ISO 9001 : 2000 standard has a similar crossreference table, which reflects current experience with the two systems. While these matrices provide some initial guidance regarding common elements in the two standards, they do have their short-comings. Neither matrix provides any guidance about how to integrate the two systems, nor do they take company-specific information into account. They also cannot identify the variety of ways that the standards can be combined. This paper will share the lessons learned from conducting more than 150 thirdparty audits at more than 100 facilities where both ISO 14001 and ISO 9001 management systems were in place.

40|$|In {{this second}} edition, the author uses the {{traditional}} better-known taxonomy, although a table listing the contemporary (or future) classification {{is presented in}} the foreword. The beginning of the book covers the public health aspects of fish parasites, and discusses methods of examining and collecting fish, and then preserving and making permanent preparations. These sections will be very helpful to students and researchers, as are the sections that list parasites by location in fish. The next sections present major groups of parasites and detailed genera and species. Drawings and photographs make identification relatively easy. An important addition to this second edition is that treatments and controls for the various parasites are given (when known). There is a section on miscellaneous parasites and pathogens, as well as fish parasites found in other animals. The parasite/host and host/parasite <b>cross-reference</b> <b>list</b> is also valuable. The section on chemotherapy and prophylaxis reports some of the most widely used therapies, as well as some promising new treatments. It also lists chemical, parasite to be treated, and methods used. There is a glossary, and although the citations only go up to 1992, there are approximately twice as many references as in the first edition. This book is an outstanding contribution, and it is recommended for all fish disease laboratories and researchers.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} a critical {{discussion of the}} literature of Alasdalr Gray (concentrating on the novels Lanark and 1982. Janlne) related to information derived from archive material in the National Library of Scotland. There are two sections. The first is critical, the second includes {{a list of the}} archive upon which much of the criticism is based. In section one the evolution of the novels is traced from conception to publication using workbook evidence. The novels are then considered and contrasted in terms of their formal structure and aims. The critical section concludes by examining Gray's literary work using scales of discrimination based around two questions: to what extent the writing engages the readers subjective responses; and in what way the writing depends upon autobiographical material as a source. It is concluded that while Lanark and 1982. Janlne share similar themes, they differ both In their overall form and in their predominant modes of writing. Lanark can be regarded as an epic in the objective mode, and 1982. Janine as a thought- experiment in the subjective mode. Section two contains an edited, annotated and <b>cross-referenced</b> <b>list</b> of the National Library of Scotlandโs archive material relating to Alasdalr Gray.

For students who might otherwise feel disconnected while in school, the annual gathering at the conference is a vital part of maintaining their motivation and inspiring perseverance. The 1995 Conference attendance was 1, 900 students and professionals. Some 230 companies, government agencies, universities and organizations were represented at the Career Fair where students gathered information regarding employment and educational opportunities. In an effort to provide as many opportunities as possible for students and recruiters, a networking room was available throughout the conference for interviewing, networking and socializing. Student poster research presentations were displayed in this area as well. A Job Information Center was also open to provide announcements for specific job opening as well as <b>cross-referenced</b> <b>lists</b> of majors/disciplines and the organizations that recruit in those areas of interest.
