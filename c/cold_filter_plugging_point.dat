40|$|Biodiesel {{production}} from non-edible feedstocks is currently drawing much attention due to legitimate {{concerns about the}} effects of using edible oil for fuel. Pangium edule Reinw is a non-edible feedstock. Pangium is a tall tree native to the Micronesia, Melanesia and the mangrove swamps of South-East Asia. In this study, biodiesel production and characterization from P. edule oil was reported. The seeds were obtained from Bogor, Indonesia. The oil was found to have an acid value of 19. 62 mg KOH/g oil. Therefore, a two-step acid-base-catalysed transesterification was used to produce biodiesel. This was followed by evaluating the physical and chemical properties of biodiesel and its blends with diesel. It has been found that the determined properties of P. edule methyl ester indicate that the oil can be considered as a future biodiesel source. The most remarkable feature of P. edule is its cloud, pour and <b>cold</b> <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> <b>points.</b> This biodiesel yielded cloud, pour and <b>cold</b> <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> <b>points</b> of - 6, - 4 and - 8 A degrees C, respectively.

Para todos esses biodieseis foram determinados o ponto de entupimento a frio, o ponto de fulgor e o perfil cromatográfico. Estes biodieseis foram misturados com diesel de petróleo para se produzir misturas contendo 5 % do biocombustível (B 5), 10 % (B 10) e 20 % (B 20), e os ensaios citados foram realizados nestas amostras. Visando a diminuição do ponto de entupimento a frio, alguns aditivos naturais foram testados e se mostraram eficientes. Por exemplo, o limoneno reduziu o ponto de entupimento do {{biodiesel}} de óleo soja em mais de 7 °C. No biodiesel de gordura suína a redução foi de 10 °C, o que significa o ponto de entupimento a frio em temperatura inferior a 13 °C. Os aditivos utilizados são solúveis nos biodieseis estudados e, também, nas misturas diesel-biodiesel, pelo menos nas concentrações testadas. Como importante exemplo de abaixamento do ponto de entupimento a frio das misturas diesel-biodiesel de gordura suína com 10 % de biodiesel (B 10), podese citar o caso da terebentina que provocou uma redução de aproximadamente 8 °C (de 12, 7 ºC para 5, 0 °C). Este mesmo aditivo caus ou uma redução de 13, 6 ºC (de 20, 3 ºC para 6, 7 ºC), na mistura diesel-biodiesel de gordura suína com 20 % de biodiesel (B 20). Este resultado é muito significativo por implicar na possibilidade de usar este tipo de combustível mesmo em regiões mais ao sul do país durante o inverno.

Biodiesel might be considered a pseudobinary mixture, namely, high-melting-point saturated fatty acid methyl esters and low–melting-point unsaturated ones. Bilayer crystal structure of biodiesel was founded. Bilayer structure with headgroups aligned next to each other inside the crystal and away from nonpolar bulk liquid was large platelet lamellae. The results showed that biodiesel was mainly composed of saturated fatty acid methyl esters (C 14 : 0 ～C 24 : 0) and unsaturated ones(C 16 : 1 ～C 22 : 1, C 18 : 2 and C 18 : 3). The cold flow properties for biodiesel were determined mainly by the amount and molecular structure of saturated fatty acid methyl esters.

40|$|Abstract: The {{production}} of synthetic fuels from alternative sources {{has increased in}} recent years as a cleaner, more sustainable source of transport fuel is now required. The European Commission has outlined renewable energy targets pertaining to transport fuel which must be met by 2020. In response to these targets Ireland has committed, through the Biofuels Obligation Scheme of 2008, to producing 3 % of transport fuels from biofuels by 2010 and 10 % by 2020. In order to be suitable for sale in Europe, diesel fuels and biodiesels must meet certain European fuel specifications outlined in the EN 590 : 2009 standard. The aim of this paper was to prepare blends of varying proportions of synthetic diesel (Cyn-diesel) fuel, produced from the pyrolysis of plastic, vs regular fossil diesel. The flash point (°C) and <b>cold</b> <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> <b>point</b> (°C) of these blends {{as well as of the}} conventional petroleum diesel fuel were analysed in relation to compliance with the European fuel standard EN 590. The results confirmed that blending of Cyn-diesel with conventional petroleum diesel has a highly significant effect on the properties of the resulting fuel blend. The results show that by increasing the Cyn-diesel content of the blend, the flash point of the blend decreases and the <b>cold</b> <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> <b>point</b> increases. Furthermore, comparing the fuel blends to EN 590 specifications has highlighted significant trends. The cold filter plugging points of all of the fuel blends are in compliance with EN 590 specifications. However, only blends of up to, and including, 40 % Cyn-diesel are in compliance with EN 590 specifications for flash point. This analysis shows that a blend of 40 % Cyn-diesel is in compliance with all of the EN 590 specifications examined, and as such could be placed on the European fue...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe use of {{petroleum}} fractions by some microorganisms {{as a food}} source {{has been known for}} years. This property has been applied mainly in the bioremediation of soils contaminated with hydrocarbons. Nevertheless, this natural degradation of hydrocarbons by microorganisms, has become a serious problem for the oil industry, since it has been observed that microbial growth occurs inside the fuel storage tanks. This fact is causing problems such as corrosion, <b>filter</b> <b>plugging</b> or blockage of pipes. Ultraviolet radiation, sonication and biocides treatments are alternatives to solve the problem. Physical and chemical treatments to prevent the growth of microorganisms in diesel fuel storage tank...|$|R

After fermentation, it {{is stored in}} tanks made of concrete or stainless steel to prevent oxidative aging and preserve its rich claret colour. The wine is usually blended to match {{the style of the}} brand to which it is to be sold.
