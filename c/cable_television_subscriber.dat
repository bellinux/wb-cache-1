25|$|The Public Safety and Cyber Security Enhancement Act was {{introduced}} on September 20 to the House by Republican Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX). Its main {{focus was on}} the unauthorized access of protected computers and proposed making modifications to the laws based on the Cable TV Privacy Act surrounding cable TV subscriber privacy, as well as various changes to pen register and trap and trace laws. The bill would have made an exception for foreign intelligence gathering in the laws that require a court order necessary for pen register and trap and trace surveillance. It would also have removed restrictions on the prohibition of gaining access to <b>cable</b> <b>television</b> <b>subscriber</b> records and only prohibited the disclosure of viewing patterns of cable television subscribers.|$|E

AMC had broadened its film content to feature colorized and more recent films by 2002. In the early 2000s, AMC abandoned its commercial-free format.

50|$|In December 1999, BT {{presented}} five tariffs—subsequently {{reduced to}} three—for approval by Oftel. These packages offered unmetered Internet access to consumers. In February 2000, cable operator Telewest did likewise for a maximum fee of £20 per month, {{and by the}} end of March, the operator had offered a broadband service for £50 per month. In April 2000, NTL offered free Internet access to its <b>cable</b> <b>television</b> <b>subscribers</b> and unmetered access at £10 per month to non-subscribers. The cable operators' business model was subsequently emulated by many other ISPs, including BT Internet, LineOne, Freeserve, Tiny Online, virgin.net and ic24. In April 2000, MCI Worldcom announced its own wholesale product after its complaint against BT for anti-competitive practises was upheld. Though BT offered an unmetered product, it wasn't until 2001 that BT had written FRIACO (Flat Rate Internet Access Call Origination) into its licence.|$|R
