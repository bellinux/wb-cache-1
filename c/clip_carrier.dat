50|$|In simple terms, Metcalfe had {{designed}} a rectangular wooden block, bored along its upper edge for eight rifle cartridges, {{that could be}} attached {{to the side of the}} Springfield rifle just ahead of the lock... This cartridge block was affixed to the weapon by means of a special lock mechanism inletted into the stock. Several of these blocks, filled with cartridges, were to be carried on a special waist belt using a <b>clip</b> <b>carrier</b> made of spring steel with a leather fastening strap for each block. The blocks were to be made and loaded with cartridges at the army's principal ammunition plant, Frankford Arsenal.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} need for {{surgical}} and prosthetic aftercare of craniofacial prostheses supported by endosseous implants. Materials and Methods: A retrospective clinical study assessing the surgical and prosthetic aftercare from implant placement to last visit of follow-up was performed in consecutively treated patients with implant-retained craniofacial prostheses in a department of oral and maxillofacial surgery between 1988 and 2003. Results: Ninety-five patients were rehabilitated with implant-retained craniofacial prostheses. Mean follow-up was 88 months (median, 79 months). Two hundred seventy implants were placed; 153 implants in the mastoid region, 99 in the orbital region, and 18 in the nasal region. The craniofacial defects were due to genetic disorders (24 patients), trauma (12 patients), and ablative tumor surgery (59 patients). In the latter group, 104 implants (33 patients) were placed in irradiated bone. Thirty implants were lost, 8 implants in nonirradiated bone (95. 2 % overall implant survival rate; mastoid, 95. 7 %; orbit, 94. 1 %; nose, 87. 5 %) and 22 implants in irradiated bone (78. 8 % overall implant survival rate; mastoid, 86. 2 %; orbit, 73. 8 %; nose, 90. 0 %). Irrespective of the craniofacial defect, on average every 1. 5 to 2 years a new facial prosthesis was made, mostly for reasons because of discoloration (31. 2 %), problems with attachment of the acrylic resin <b>clip</b> <b>carrier</b> to the silicone (25. 3 %), rupture of the silicone (13. 3 %), or bad fit (10. 9 %). Severe skin reactions around implants or beneath prostheses were only observed in the orbital region. Conclusion: Implant-retained craniofacial prostheses are a reliable treatment option {{for the restoration of}} craniotacial defects. The need for surgical aftercare was minor, and prosthetic aftercare predominantly consisted of making new prostheses...|$|E
40|$|Establishing hidden {{communication}} {{is an important}} subject of discussion that has gained increasing importance nowadays {{with the development of}} the internet. One of the key methods for establishing hidden {{communication is}} steganography. Modern day steganography mainly deals with hiding information within files like image, text, html, binary files etc. These file contains small irrelevant information that can be substituted for small secret data. To store a high capacity secret data these carrier files are not very supportive. To overcome the problem of storing the high capacity secret data with the utmost security fence, we have proposed a novel methodology for concealing a voluminous data with high levels of security wall by using movie <b>clip</b> as a <b>carrier</b> file.

50|$|It {{turns out}} that chef Mike was a {{formerly}} Special Ops and he recognizes that Vincent and Nikki are not who they say they are. He doubts {{the validity of the}} coordination points, but neither Ruoxin nor Gary believes him. In the meantime, a series of dreadful events happen, one after another. First, Peter is killed for discovering Vincents true identity, then Lily Young and an air hostess are killed by one of the creatures that has managed to get on the plane. Facing the panic and the rebellion from the now-convinced Ruoxin and Mike, Vincent and Nikki reveal their true purpose, proceed to hijack the plane, and take everyone onboard hostage. The so-called destination is a retired Nimitz aircraft carrier. After several tries Ruoxin dramatically lands the plane on the <b>carrier,</b> <b>clipping</b> the wing as she does so. Most of the survivors reach the deck, while the broken A390 slides off the carrier and sinks into the ocean.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the operation and}} performance of an acousto-optic demodulator system consisting of a laser source, an acousto-optic cell and a bi-cell detector. The bi-cell detector {{is made up of}} two photodiodes positioned side by side, separated by a small gap. Theory is developed to predict the following; the linear operating range for different gap sizes, absolute frequency sensitivity, system output in response to discrete phase changes, optimum gap size for phase demodulation, absolute descrete phase change sensitivity, the performance of the system in the presence of carrier noise and the effect of <b>clipping</b> the <b>carrier</b> signal on both frequency and phase modulated signals. A detailed model of the system has been written, using the software package Mathcad, which incorporates all the parameters that affect the performance of the physical system. The model has been used to study how the performance of the system changes as these parameters are varied. It is shown that the AO demodulator {{can be used in a}} number of ways; as a frequency demodulator, a phase demodulator and to demodulate digitally modulated signals, and that the optimum values of some parameters are different for each application. The model is also used to investigate the response of the system to a number of the most common forms of digital modulation. It is shown that it is possible, without any a priori knowledge of the signal, to identify each of these forms of modulation, and ultimately decode messages contained on the signals. The system can also be used to measure the frequency shift on pulse doppler radar. It is shown that the rms frequency error on a pulse using the AO demodulator is 150 % better than that of existing systems. Experimental results are presented that are in good agreement with the results gained from both the theoretical and modelled analysis of the system. Finally suggestions are made for areas of further work on the signal processing of the output signals and possible uses of the demodulator in the future. DRA (Funtington...|$|R
40|$|The {{desire to}} build lower cost analog {{front-ends}} has triggered {{interest in a}} new domain of research. Consequently the joint design of the analog front-end and of the digital baseband algorithms has become an important field of research. It enables the wireless systems and chip designers to more effectively trade the communication performance with the production cost. Digital Compensation for Analog Front-Ends provides a systematic approach to designing a digital communication system. It covers in detail the digital compensation of many non-idealities, for a wide class of emerging broadband standards and with a system approach {{in the design of}} the receiver algorithms. In particular, system strategies for joint estimation of synchronization and front-end non-ideality parameters are emphasized. The book is organized to allow the reader to gradually absorb the important information and vast quantity of material on this subject. The first chapter is a comprehensive introduction to the emerging wireless standards which is followed by a detailed description of the front-end non-idealities in chapter two. Chapter three then uses this information to explore what happens when the topics introduced in the first two chapters are merged. The book concludes with two chapters providing an in-depth coverage of the estimation and compensation algorithms. This book is a valuable reference for wireless system architects and chip designers as well as engineers or managers in system design and development. It will also be of interest to researchers in industry and academia, graduate students and wireless network operators. Presents a global, systematic approach to the joint design of the analog front-end compensation, channel estimation, synchronization and of the digital baseband algorithms Describes in depth the main front-end non-idealities such as phase noise, IQ imbalance, non-linearity, <b>clipping,</b> quantization, <b>carrier</b> frequency offset, sampling clock offset and their impact on the modulation Explains how the non-idealities introduced by the analog front-end elements can be compensated digitally Methodologies are applied to the emerging Wireless Local Area Network and outdoor Cellular communication systems, hence covering OFDM(A), SC-FDE and MIMO Written by authors with in-depth expertise developed in the wireless research group of IMEC and projects covering the main broadband wireless standards.
