40|$|Abstract—We have {{implemented}} a two-dimensional (2 -D) pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) numerical solution of Maxwell’s equations {{to calculate the}} total scattering cross-section (TSCS) spectrum of a macroscopic, <b>closely</b> <b>packed,</b> random medium consisting of dielectric cylinders. Results reported in this letter show that a TSCS spectral signature is identified, revealing structural information of the random medium. Furthermore, {{by means of the}} proposed cross-correlation analysis, the diameter of constituent cylinders within a <b>closely</b> <b>packed</b> cluster can be determined. On a broader perspective, based on first principles, our research findings may lead {{to a better understanding of}} the coherent interference effect of light scattering by <b>closely</b> <b>packed</b> random media. Specifically, we show that, microscopic structural information of the random medium can be determined from the forward, multiply scattered light, even for optically thick, <b>closely</b> <b>packed</b> random media, with scatterers spaced less than a single wavelength apart. Index Terms—Closely packed random media, cross-correlation, multiply scattered light, total scattering cross-section. I...|$|R
