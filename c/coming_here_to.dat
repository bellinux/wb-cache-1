500|$|On June 17, 1825, an {{expedition}} from HMS Blonde, led by botanist James Macrae, reached {{the summit of}} Mauna Kea. Macrae {{was the first person}} to record the Mauna Kea silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense), saying: [...] "The last mile was destitute of vegetation except one plant of the Sygenisia tribe, in growth much like a Yucca, with sharp pointed silver coloured leaves and green upright spike of three or four feet producing pendulous branches with brown flowers, truly superb, and almost worth the journey of <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> see it on purpose." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Chronicle of Higher Education, a dean at the University of Texas at Austin stated he'd like to crack down on consensual relationships between professors and students. [...] "Wait until she graduates," [...] he says he tells male professors. [...] "We have a kind of sacred trust to the students," [...] he explains. [...] "They're <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> get us to evaluate what their abilities are and what their future could be. These relationships poison the whole academic well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fergus {{decided he}} had to meet with Flidhais, this {{magnificent}} woman with a reputed sexual prowess to match his own, and he quickly set off {{to travel to the}} fort where he would find Flidhais. Oilill heard about Fergus lusting for his wife and he set out from his fort to meet Fergus's entourage. When the two entourages met there was a heated argument. Oilill Fionn bluntly asked Fergus [...] "are you <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> take my wife?" [...] Fergus admitted that that was his intention.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Lucy, dear,"--and now Mrs. Roberts {{put her arm}} {{round her}} sister-in-law's waist--"he is <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> {{especially}} <b>to</b> see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think she}} is simply wicked. False, superstitious, inveterately cruel--but not mad. I believe her main motive in <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> was <b>to</b> enjoy the luxury of {{frightening}} you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary," [...] replied Magdalen, [...] "you have exactly {{expressed}} my meaning. My {{object in}} <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> is <b>to</b> warn Mr. Noel Vanstone against the course {{which he is}} now taking." ...|$|R
2500|$|Responding to {{some calls}} for an early general election, [...] "sources close to Mrs May" [...] {{said there was no}} need for such an election. In a speech after her appointment, May {{emphasised}} the term [...] "Unionist" [...] in the name of the Conservative Party, reminding all of [...] "the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland." [...] By 15 July, May had travelled to Edinburgh to meet with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to reinforce the bond between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. [...] "I'm <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> show my commitment to preserving this special union that has endured for centuries," [...] she explained.|$|E
2500|$|On June 27, 2007, Thompson {{spoke of}} his concern that many illegal {{immigrants}} came from terrorist-related states, and he mentioned Cubans who had been apprehended in the United States. [...] "If they're coming from Cuba, where else are they coming from? And I don't imagine they're <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> bring greetings from Castro. We're living {{in the era of}} the suitcase bomb." [...] After this remark sparked some controversy, Thompson clarified: [...] "The Castro regime remains dedicated to infiltrating American institutions to spread his ideology of tyranny. ... It’s also why we must oppose the illegal immigration of Castro’s agents into the United States while welcoming the vast majority who immigrate legally and with legal intentions." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{used to be}} a real leftist. I {{remember}} Arik Sharon [...] <b>coming</b> <b>here,</b> <b>to</b> my house, a {{few months}} before Camp David, when he was still leader of the opposition. He told me there would be no deal because [...] Arafat would not sign. I told myself that {{there was nothing to be}} done – these right-wingers were simply insane. I had no doubt that there would be a deal and the problems would be resolved. History proved that Sharon was right and I was wrong. In matters relating to security, that moved me to the right. Very far to the right...When there is a terrorist attack, I am [...] Lieberman. Sometimes to the right of Lieberman. For two days I really love Lieberman. But afterward I come back to reality. Look, I don't see a solution today." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had come}} to think you counted on staying with the {{blooming}} Britishers, instead of <b>coming</b> back <b>here</b> <b>to</b> do your share of playing at soldiering." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And that's thrue for you, Father John; but Myles isn't {{tired of}} me, else {{why should he}} be <b>coming</b> up <b>here</b> <b>to</b> see me oftener than ever?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I won't," [...] replied her mother, as before. [...] "I {{suppose he}} was mystified. But now, if it's really settled between you, he'll be <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> soon <b>to</b> see your papa and me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You wouldn't {{speak in}} that light, {{careless}} tone {{if you knew}} her! Well, you'll see her to-night. She's <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{glad that}} makes me! Why, I quit <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> see {{and feed the}} dogs because {{somebody}} was always kicking them around." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Major Fitz-David {{brings you}} some news, my dear," [...] he said. [...] "Your mother-in-law, Mrs. Macallan, is <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> see you to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have got}} through all that,--you and I have for ourselves;--but {{there is a}} sort of unseemliness in your <b>coming</b> down <b>here</b> <b>to</b> see a poor Quaker's daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--by appointment," [...] {{the young}} man replied. [...] "We were all <b>coming</b> on <b>here</b> <b>to</b> the dance, and we had agreed to dine {{together}} first at the Savoy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you? Well now, that's odd! How much I {{should like}} to see him. To tell you the truth, one of my chief reasons for <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> was <b>to</b> see him. What like is he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, peace! peace! peace! Blister your merciless tongue, haven't {{all these}} {{thoughts}} tortured me enough without your <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> fetch them back again!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] said Paul, [...] "you {{are expecting}} company this afternoon. Don Caesar--I mean Miss Briones {{and her brother}} are <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> say good-by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even {{under those}} {{circumstances}} I must refuse, though I would give a guinea to be with you. John Eames is <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> say good-by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{some nice}} {{boys and girls}} to play with," [...] cried Kitty, eagerly {{following}} the new suggestion. [...] "They are all <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> directly <b>to</b> dine with me. You will stay and have dinner too, won't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed it will!" [...] laughed Prissy. [...] "I'm {{so happy}} now I could sing. I {{believe it was}} an inspiration--my idea of <b>coming</b> up <b>here</b> <b>to</b> cook your dinner for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{heard them}} call him that," [...] said Barry. [...] "McTodd and I were <b>coming</b> down <b>here</b> <b>to</b> tea, {{when they started}} going for us, so we nipped in <b>here,</b> hoping <b>to</b> find reinforcements." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! No; {{she showed}} me over the {{greatest}} part on Saturday--and we were <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> these rooms--but only"--dropping her voice--"your father was with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{good of you}} <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> find me, old fellow. You {{are always}} getting me out of scrapes. You {{remember}} that affair at Toulouse.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'll tell you," [...] said Bathsheba, with {{a mischievous}} smile in her bright eyes. [...] "Farmer Oak is <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> dine with me to-day!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Entirely," [...] Lutchester agreed, [...] "but {{where he}} goes wrong is that his primary object in <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> was <b>to</b> meet Hie chief of the Japanese Secret Service, to whom {{he has made a}} {{proposition}} of precisely similar character." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} the honour presently," [...] said Fourier, [...] "of <b>coming</b> back <b>here</b> <b>to</b> respond to M. le Comte's gracious {{invitation}} to dinner. Why shouldn't I bring the money with me then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} think of it!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "You would simply write my death-warrant. Don't allude to that matter again. I have risked enough in <b>coming</b> in <b>here</b> <b>to</b> sit with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{my turn to}} play," [...] she said. [...] "And Blanche is <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> {{look for}} me. Wait there, and I'll stop her on the steps." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{no sense}} in <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> worry the young lady," [...] Mrs. Malony {{declared}} irritably. [...] "As for Mr. Craig, I told you that he'd gone out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some one-- I'd like to {{find out}} about <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> live--to see the place, and so on. Can you have {{somebody}} show me one of the rooms?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} by <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> and trying <b>to</b> {{blackmail}} me?" [...] Mr. Ward was snarling at him. [...] "Here, give me back that money." ...|$|R
60|$|KNOX. She {{said she}} had no {{patience}} with the airs people gave themselves in the East. A Eurasian was {{just as good as}} anybody else. And when I happened to say I was <b>coming</b> <b>here</b> to-day <b>to</b> see how you were she said she'd come too.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do!" [...] she answered. [...] "You can {{certainly}} manage something between you. Matt will be almost as glad of your coming as my going. I {{thought we were}} <b>coming</b> up <b>here</b> <b>to</b> reassure Sue, but I seem strangely superfluous." ...|$|R
