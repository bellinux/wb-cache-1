5|$|In January 1940, the British <b>cryptanalyst</b> Alan Turing {{spent several}} days at PC Bruno conferring with his Polish colleagues. He {{had brought the}} Poles {{a full set of}} Zygalski sheets that had been {{produced}} at Bletchley Park by John Jeffreys using Polish-supplied information. On 17 January 1940, the Poles made the first break into wartime Enigma traffic—that from 28 October 1939.|$|E
5|$|Max Newman {{had been}} {{appointed}} to the Chair of Pure Mathematics at Manchester University in 1945. During the Second World War he {{had worked as a}} <b>cryptanalyst</b> at Bletchley Park, and had led the team which in 1943 produced the first of the Colossus code-breaking computers. Although Newman played no active {{role in the development of}} the SSEM, or any of the subsequent Manchester computers, he was generally supportive and enthusiastic about the project, and arranged for the acquisition of war-surplus supplies for its construction, including GPO metal racks from Bletchley.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} Kabaty Woods, at Pyry, on 25 and 26 July 1939 {{with war}} looming that, on {{instructions}} from the Polish General Staff, the Cipher Bureau's chiefs, Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and Major Maksymilian Ciężki, the three civilian mathematician-cryptologists, and Col. Stefan Mayer, chief of intelligence, revealed Poland's achievements to cryptanalytical representatives of France and Britain, explaining how they had broken Enigma. They undertook to give each country a Polish-reconstructed Enigma, along with details of their equipment, including Zygalski sheets and Rejewski's cryptologic bomb. In return, the British pledged to prepare two full sets of Zygalski sheets for all 60 possible wheel orders. The French contingent consisted of Major Gustave Bertrand, the French radio-intelligence and cryptology chief, and Capt. Henri Braquenié of the French Air Force staff. The British sent Commander Alastair Denniston, head of Britain's Government Code and Cypher School, Dilly Knox, chief British <b>cryptanalyst</b> and Commander Humphrey Sandwith, head of the Royal Navy's intercept and direction-finding stations.|$|E

50|$|OKW/Chi's {{cryptanalysis}} was not outstandingly successful against {{systems of}} high security. This {{may have been}} {{not only because the}} Allies high security systems were actually high security, but in some part unsolvable to the Allies <b>cryptanalysts</b> as well, but because the OKW/Chi <b>cryptanalysts</b> never became technically proficient enough to undertake the solution to these high-security systems.|$|R
50|$|With CSA now {{publicly}} {{known in}} its entirety, <b>cryptanalysts</b> {{started looking for}} weaknesses.|$|R
50|$|The {{security}} of Enigma ciphers did have fundamental weaknesses that proved helpful to <b>cryptanalysts.</b>|$|R
25|$|The primary {{weakness}} of the Vigenère cipher is the repeating nature of its key. If a <b>cryptanalyst</b> correctly guesses the key's length, then the cipher text can be treated as interwoven Caesar ciphers, which individually are easily broken. The Kasiski examination and Friedman test can help determine the key length.|$|E
25|$|More complex use of {{statistics}} can be conceived, such as considering counts of pairs of letters (bigrams), triplets (trigrams), and so on. This {{is done to}} provide more information to the <b>cryptanalyst,</b> for instance, Q and U nearly always occur together in that order in English, even though Q itself is rare.|$|E
25|$|In 1921 {{he became}} chief <b>cryptanalyst</b> for the War Department and later led the Signals Intelligence Service (SIS)—a {{position}} he kept {{for a quarter}} century. In 1929, after The American Black Chamber in New York City was disbanded, its files were entrusted to SIS, and the cryptographic and intelligence services was reorganized to suit its new position at the War Department.|$|E
50|$|The Japanese Army {{could not}} have asked for more {{distinguished}} teachers. Polish <b>cryptanalysts</b> would later break early versions of the German Enigma machine in 1932 and their work jump-started the French and British efforts to break later, more complicated, Enigma machines. In the 1920s and 1930s it is {{accurate to say that}} Polish <b>cryptanalysts</b> were some {{of the best in the}} world.|$|R

5000|$|The set of {{shortcomings}} {{that the}} Polish <b>cryptanalysts</b> exploited to such great effect included the following: ...|$|R
25|$|In {{a simple}} {{substitution}} cipher, each {{letter of the}} plaintext is replaced with another, and any particular letter in the plaintext will always be transformed into the same letter in the ciphertext. For instance, if all occurrences of the letter e turn into the letter X, a ciphertext message containing numerous instances of the letter X would suggest to a <b>cryptanalyst</b> that X represents e.|$|E
25|$|Turing's {{solution}} to {{working out the}} stecker values (plugboard connections) was to note that, even though the values for, say, A or W, were unknown, the crib still provided known relationships amongst these values; that is, the values after the plugboard transformation. Using these relationships, a <b>cryptanalyst</b> could reason {{from one to another}} and, potentially, derive a logical contradiction, in which case the rotor setting under consideration could be ruled out.|$|E
25|$|An {{improvement}} to the Kasiski examination, {{known as}} Kerckhoffs' method, matches each column's letter frequencies to shifted plaintext frequencies {{to discover the}} key letter (Caesar shift) for that column. Once every letter in the key is known, the <b>cryptanalyst</b> can simply decrypt the ciphertext and reveal the plaintext. Kerckhoffs' method is not applicable when the Vigenère table has been scrambled, rather than using normal alphabetic sequences, although Kasiski examination and coincidence tests can still {{be used to determine}} key length in that case.|$|E

50|$|Military Cryptanalytics (or MILCRYP {{as it is}} {{sometimes}} known) is a revision by Lambros D. Callimahos of the series of books written by William F. Friedman under the title Military Cryptanalysis. It may also contain contributions by other <b>cryptanalysts.</b> It was a training manual for National Security Agency and military <b>cryptanalysts.</b> It was published for government use between 1957 and 1977, though parts I and II were written in 1956 and 1959.|$|R

25|$|The basic use of {{frequency}} analysis is to first count {{the frequency of}} ciphertext letters and then associate guessed plaintext letters with them. More Xs in the ciphertext than anything else suggests that X corresponds to e in the plaintext, {{but this is not}} certain; t and a are also very common in English, so X might be either of them also. It is unlikely to be a plaintext z or q which are less common. Thus the <b>cryptanalyst</b> may need to try several combinations of mappings between ciphertext and plaintext letters.|$|E
25|$|The running key {{variant of}} the Vigenère cipher was also {{considered}} unbreakable at one time. This version uses as the key a block of text {{as long as the}} plaintext. Since the key is as long as the message the Friedman and Kasiski tests no longer work (the key is not repeated). In 1920, Friedman was the first to discover this variant's weaknesses. The problem with the running key Vigenère cipher is that the <b>cryptanalyst</b> has statistical information about the key (assuming that the block of text is in a known language) and that information will be reflected in the ciphertext.|$|E
25|$|Many {{knowledgeable}} chess {{people believe}} that Alexander had Grandmaster potential, had he been able to develop his chess abilities further. Many top players peak in their late twenties and early thirties, but for Alexander this stretch coincided with World War II, when high-level competitive opportunities were unavailable. After this, his professional responsibilities as a senior <b>cryptanalyst</b> limited his top-class appearances. He defeated Mikhail Botvinnik in one game of a team radio match against the Soviet Union in 1946, {{at a time when}} Botvinnik was probably the world's top player. Alexander made important theoretical contributions to the Dutch Defence and Petroff Defence.|$|E

Despite proving the {{security}} in theory, real-world application {{falls short of}} the ideal. Last year, <b>cryptanalysts</b> completed an experiment demonstrating a successful eavesdropping attack on commercial quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. This attack exploits a weakness in the typical real-world implementation of quantum cryptosystems. <b>Cryptanalysts</b> have successfully attacked several protocols.

25|$|A bombe run {{involved}} a <b>cryptanalyst</b> first obtaining a crib — {{a section of}} plaintext that was thought to correspond to the ciphertext. Finding cribs {{was not at all}} straightforward; it required considerable familiarity with German military jargon and the communication habits of the operators. However, the codebreakers were aided {{by the fact that the}} Enigma would never encrypt a letter to itself. This helped in testing a possible crib against the ciphertext, as it could rule out a number of cribs and positions, where the same letter occurred in the same position in both the plaintext and the ciphertext. This was termed a crash at Bletchley Park.|$|E
25|$|Although {{frequency}} analysis {{can be a}} powerful and general technique against many ciphers, encryption has still often been effective in practice, as many a would-be <b>cryptanalyst</b> was unaware of the technique. Breaking a message without using {{frequency analysis}} essentially required knowledge of the cipher used and perhaps of the key involved, thus making espionage, bribery, burglary, defection, etc., more attractive approaches to the cryptanalytically uninformed. It was finally explicitly recognized in the 19th century that secrecy of a cipher's algorithm is not a sensible nor practical safeguard of message security; in fact, it was further realized that any adequate cryptographic scheme (including ciphers) should remain secure even if the adversary fully understands the cipher algorithm itself. Security of the key used should alone be sufficient for a good cipher to maintain confidentiality under an attack. This fundamental principle was first explicitly stated in 1883 by Auguste Kerckhoffs and is generally called Kerckhoffs's Principle; alternatively and more bluntly, it was restated by Claude Shannon, the inventor of information theory and the fundamentals of theoretical cryptography, as Shannon's Maxim—'the enemy knows the system'.|$|E
25|$|The United States Department of Justice and FBI {{have not}} {{enforced}} the DMCA as rigorously {{as had been}} feared by some, but the law, nonetheless, remains a controversial one. Niels Ferguson, a well-respected cryptography researcher, has publicly stated {{that he will not}} release some of his research into an Intel security design for fear of prosecution under the DMCA. <b>Cryptanalyst</b> Bruce Schneier has argued that the DMCA encourages vendor lock-in, while inhibiting actual measures toward cyber-security. Both Alan Cox (longtime Linux kernel developer) and Edward Felten (and some of his students at Princeton) have encountered problems related to the Act. Dmitry Sklyarov was arrested during a visit to the US from Russia, and jailed for five months pending trial for alleged violations of the DMCA arising from work he had done in Russia, where the work was legal. In 2007, the cryptographic keys responsible for Blu-ray and HD DVD content scrambling were discovered and released onto the Internet. In both cases, the MPAA sent out numerous DMCA takedown notices, and there was a massive Internet backlash triggered by the perceived impact of such notices on fair use and free speech.|$|E
