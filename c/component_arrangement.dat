50|$|The EP-5s had a {{reputation}} for rapid acceleration and high pulling capacity. However, the class also had a tendency to overheat and catch fire due to the crowded, poorly ventilated internal <b>component</b> <b>arrangement,</b> a situation made necessary by the need for the units to conform to the weight restrictions imposed by the New York Central's Park Avenue steel viaduct. This problem was significantly aggravated by the New Haven management's de-emphasis of electric operations in favor of its new dual-power FL9 diesels, and the railroad's financial condition. By 1962, a year after the New Haven entered bankruptcy, only three units were in service. All 10 were quickly rebuilt under the trustees' management, but {{by the time of the}} New Haven's 1969 inclusion in Penn Central, four were again out of service (and were soon scrapped). The EP-5s were rapidly replaced on Washington-Boston trains by the reliable former PRR GG1 electrics.|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method {{for the production}} of <b>component</b> <b>arrangement</b> (100) with a first substrate (11) and a second substrate (12, 12 ') arranged on the first substrate, where the first substrate comprises a first contact element and the second substrate comprises a second contact element corresponding to the first contact element, comprises providing first and second contact elements having contact surfaces, applying a protective layer (15, 15 ') on the first substrate, where the protective layer covers a part area of the first substrate and the part area of the contact surface surrounds a first contact element and/or applying a protective layer on the second substrate, where the protective layer covers the second substrate and the part area of the contact surface surrounds the second contact element, and connecting the contact surface of the first contact element with the corresponding contact surface of the second contact element for producing an electric contact. The two contacts (16, 16 ') are arranged and the protective layer is structured so that the part area of the first substrate and/or the part area of the second substrate form a connecting zone in which the contacts exist. A channel is formed between the protective layer and the contacts. A switching carrier or an electronic, optical or micromechanical component present in wafer assembly is arranged as first and/or as second substrate. The protective layer does not touch the electric contacts. The protective layer is applied on the first substrate and/or the second substrate. The surface of the protective layer turned away the first and/or the second substrate is applied with an adhesive and/or the protective layer is adhered. The height of the first and second contact elements before connecting the contact surfaces is smaller than the height of the protective layer and the contact surfaces are connected together by thermo compression. The protective layer of the first and second substrate connects to each other. The protective layer connects the first and the second substrate and subsequently the contact surfaces are connected together by soldering or remelting. Before connecting the contact surfaces, a gas for spraying in the channel is guided. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a <b>component</b> <b>arrangement</b> with substrates.

In such communities distributed groups of individual customers focus on voluntarily sharing and elaborating innovative ideas to support company’s new products development. However, a look at existing ideas community leads {{to the conclusion that}} many of them are featured to the minimum necessary. Typically, they fail to provide technical <b>components</b> and organizational <b>arrangements</b> that are able to motivate customers to submit ideas. Based on insights from motivation theory it is known that such <b>components</b> and <b>arrangements</b> could serve as incentives for submitting ideas, as they activate customers’ corresponding motives, which again lead to idea submission. In reverse, this means when knowing customers different motives one can systematically derive adequate <b>components</b> and <b>arrangements</b> from it. The aim {{of this paper is to}} derive components from customers’ motives. Our research approach is two-folded. First, we applied an online survey among participants of the SAPiens ideas community. We empirically queried motives that lead participants to submit ideas. After that we come up with an empirical tested set of six motives (self-marketing, fun, altruism, recognition, product improvement and enhancement as well as learning). Second, we used these six motives in order to derive a set of adequate components from it.
