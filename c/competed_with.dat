40|$|Intraspecific or {{interspecific}} {{competition is}} then fundamentally the same: scramble competition {{is a good}} example of this type of competition. Modern ecology increasingly is faced with the question whether the data or a paper provide evidence for the statement that is made or for testing the hypotheses one believes in. Much of the research on antelopes and ungulates in general suffers from an exuberance of possible causes to explain numerical changes in study populations. Multi-causality is the bane of community ecology. The issue of facilitation of antelopes by zebra has been a long-running theme in African savanna ecology. The cases of competition are as follows: small antelopes <b>competing</b> <b>with</b> giraffe, cattle that <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> gaur, cattle that <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> deer, cattle that <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> impala, cattle that <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> buffalo, and buffalo that <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> African elephant and possibly blue wildebeest that <b>compete</b> <b>with</b> African elephant. </p...|$|R

5|$|As it {{was easy}} to find and kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch {{settlers}} and later by Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally.

The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the Orange Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s.

5|$|Author Timothy White {{has called}} Paramount's efforts to launch its own {{television}} service, which directly <b>competed</b> <b>with</b> the DuMont Television Network, an unwise decision – Paramount in effect was competing with itself.

Although Benjamin tried some jury cases, he preferred bench trials in commercial cases and was an expert at appeals.|$|E
