5|$|In late 2005 the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) {{threatened}} action {{over the}} holding in captivity of Mercedes, then Britain's only polar bear. The zoo had initially planned to retire their polar bear exhibit after Mercedes died. When zoo officials {{announced plans to}} create a new attraction, citing their responsibility to ensure the survival of the species, the ALF threatened damage to zoo workers' property and other scare-tactics. Edinburgh's treatment of polar bears had often been subject to criticism, punctuated by incidents like the death in 1997 of Mercedes' partner Barney, who <b>choked</b> <b>on</b> a plastic child's toy thrown into his enclosure. In 2009 the zoo carried out their plans {{to create a new}} exhibit and improve conditions for Mercedes, moving her to the Highland Wildlife Park, where she was joined by a young male polar bear named Walker. Mercedes was euthanized on compassionate grounds in 2011, suffering from severe arthritis.|$|E

25|$|For a flow with an {{upstream}} Mach number {{greater than}} 1.0 in a sufficiently long enough duct, deceleration occurs {{and the flow}} can become <b>choked.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, for a flow with an upstream Mach number less than 1.0, acceleration occurs and the flow can become choked in a sufficiently long duct. It can be shown that for flow of calorically perfect gas the maximum entropy occurs at M= 1.0. Fanno flow is named after Gino Girolamo Fanno.|$|E
500|$|Melua is {{occasionally}} {{referred to}} as an 'adrenaline junkie' because she enjoys roller coasters and funfairs and often paraglides and hang glides. She has skydived four times and taken several flying lessons, and in 2004 she was lowered from a 200-metre building in New Zealand at 60mph. When asked about Melua being an 'adrenaline junkie', Mike Batt said, [...] "she enjoys extremes, but in life her emotions are always in check". In November 2009, Melua came near to drowning after she breathed in and <b>choked</b> <b>on</b> a lungful of water when diving in a lake near Heathrow Airport.|$|E
500|$|At the time, de Boer {{was busy}} working in Canada but was unknown {{as an actress}} in the United States. She was called to Los Angeles to {{audition}} in person based {{on the strength of}} the tape, where she performed a four and a half minute scene written specifically for the audition. It was later converted into a scene used in the episode [...] "". She thought she had ruined her audition when she nearly <b>choked</b> <b>on</b> a glass of water as executive producer Rick Berman entered the room and had to run to the bathroom, by which time she had already soaked her clothes and caused her mascara to run. But Behr praised her, saying [...] "We got a good vibe off her, she knew her part. She got it. And that was it." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the film}} Lethal Weapon, Mel Gibson's {{character}} Martin Riggs uses the triangle <b>choke</b> <b>on</b> a villain Mr. Joshua played by actor Gary Busey. Rorion Gracie is credited as the film’s special technical advisor: Brazilian jiu-jitsu. [...] In the film Abduction, Taylor Lautner's character uses the triangle <b>choke</b> <b>on</b> an antagonist. In the film Haywire, Gina Carano's character uses the triangle <b>choke</b> <b>on</b> Michael Fassbender's character. During a school {{fight in the}} anime Ikki Tousen, the character Ryomou Shimei uses the triangle <b>choke</b> <b>on</b> another character, Hakufu. In the 2013 film Oblivion, Tom Cruise's character (Tech 49, Jack Harper) subdues Tech 52 with a triangle choke, to avoid injuring him. Paul Walker, who was a practitioner of Brazilian Ju Jitsu, attempted to triangle Vin Diesel's character in the Fast and Furious series. In episode 5 of Game of Thrones: A Telltale Game Series, a pit fighter named 'Bloodsong' uses this technique while on supine position to choke Asher, one of the 5 playable protagonists in the game. In episode 3 of the God Eater anime, Alisa Illinichina Amiella uses the triangle <b>choke</b> <b>on</b> Lenka Utsugi, the main protagonist.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Not on Drugs" [...] was {{directed}} by Rikkard Häggbom. It was released on Lo's Vevo channel and iTunes Store on 19 August 2014, {{the same day the}} singer announced the release of Queen of the Clouds. [...] The clip features the singer dancing and performing the song in a white film set and other locations while colored smoke bombs explode around her. During the video, computer-generated animation is projected on the background and Lo's body is edited to appear distorsed. In an interview with Rolling Stone, the artist said, [...] "I <b>choked</b> <b>on</b> the paint, the smoke made me half blind and here is my three-minute trip that shows the intensity and weirdness I feel when falling in love. The main theme we had in mind while making this video was 'What just happened?' It was quite amazing making something with the happy piece of my heart this time!".|$|E
2500|$|Anthony Shadid, {{reporting}} for the Washington Post, described the scene {{he saw that}} day: [...] "Most of the dead had <b>choked</b> <b>on</b> flying dirt and other debris. Their bodies, intact, preserved their final gestures: a raised arm called for help, an old man pulled on pants. Twelve-year-old Hussein Hashem lay curled in the fetal position, his mouth seeming to have vomited earth. Mohammed Chalhoub sat on the ground, his right hand broken. Khadja, his wife and Hasna, his mother, were dead, as were his daughters, Hawra and Zahra, aged twelve and two. As were his sons, Ali, ten: Yahya, nine; and Assem, seven." ...|$|E

Two days later, original drummer Stuart Cable {{was found dead in}} his home in Aberdare having <b>choked</b> <b>on</b> his own vomit after binge drinking. After the Keep Calm and Carry On Tour concluded, and their contract with Universal at an end, Kelly Jones wanted to change the way the band works and so decided to take a break from writing and recording an album every two years.|$|E

While Fisher was in Chicago filming the movie, she <b>choked</b> <b>on</b> a Brussels sprout; Dan Aykroyd performed the Heimlich maneuver and [...] "saved my life". She appeared on Broadway in Censored Scenes from King Kong in 1980.

2500|$|Dry Food: [...] Dry foods {{may cause}} choke, {{especially}} if the horse does not have free access to water, or if the horse has other risk factors linked to choking. [...] While pelleted or cubed feeds in general fall in this category, horse owners sometimes express particular concerns about beet pulp. [...] However, while horses have <b>choked</b> <b>on</b> beet pulp, a university study did not document that beet pulp is a particular problem. [...] It is believed that choke related to beet pulp is linked [...] to the particle size and the horse's aggressive feeding behaviour, rather than the actual feed itself. Research suggests that horses that bolt their feed without sufficient chewing, or {{who do not have}} adequate access to water, {{are far more likely to}} choke, regardless of the type of feed, compared to horses that eat at a more leisurely rate. The risk of choke associated with any dry feed can be reduced by soaking the ration prior to feeding.|$|E
2500|$|Téodor is a teddy bear, as {{evidenced}} by [...] He and his family originate from Minsk, Belarus (his father was an actuary) and is apparently of Jewish descent. He is a skilled cook, musician and graphic designer, and is also an all around friendly guy. He was originally quite crazy and uninhibited, exhibiting nudist tendencies in early Achewood strips, though {{he seems to have}} calmed down a bit over the years. While talented and intelligent, Téodor is also portrayed as lacking motivation and direction. A large exception to this is the considerable amount of time he is shown exercising or cooking, of which he is especially fond (every Achewood character has at least a slight interest in cooking, but Téodor's talent in this area is the most proficient). He had an online relationship with a girl named Penny, but it is not shown how the relationship ended up. Penny made Téodor the T-emblazoned sweater he wears, leaving it as a gift for him in the April 18, 2002, comic. While the other stuffed animals of the house treat Phillipe as a roommate, Téodor instead fills the role of Phillipe's guardian while the young otter is separated from his mother; he goes as far as to buy numerous child-care books, and, after being forced to expose the boy to Chick Tracts, diffused the effect of the prejudiced papers by making his own, nonsensical tracts to mix in with them. He has appeared in numerous strips recreationally using marijuana and seems to also be a user of psychedelic mushrooms. [...] Téodor's birthday is in early October. In 2001, Lie Bot predicted Téodor's death would be on April 28, 2005. Téodor did in fact die on that date, after he <b>choked</b> <b>on</b> a Grolsch bottle cap whilst watching a pornographic film. He was revived, however, when Lyle performed a [...] "Longshoreman's Heimlich" [...] (swift kick to the gut), which dislodged the cap and revived him. [...] Téodor listens to The Cure, Joy Division, and The Smiths.|$|E

Two invisible guns spoke fervently for half a minute, and broke off like terriers <b>choked</b> <b>on</b> a leash. We climbed till the topmost platform swayed sicklily beneath us. Here one found a rustic shelter, always of the tea-garden pattern, a table, a map, and a little window wreathed with living branches that gave one the first view of the Devil and all his works. It was a stretch of open country, with a few sticks like old tooth-brushes which had once been trees round a farm. The rest was yellow grass, barren to all appearance as the veldt.|$|E
