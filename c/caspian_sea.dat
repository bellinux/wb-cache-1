5|$|Crested and marbled newts {{are found}} in Eurasia, from Great Britain and the Iberian Peninsula {{in the west to}} West Siberia and the {{southern}} <b>Caspian</b> <b>Sea</b> region in the east, and reach north to central Fennoscandia. Overall, the species have contiguous, parapatric ranges; only the northern crested newt and the marbled newt occur sympatrically in western France, and the southern crested newt has a disjunct, allopatric distribution in Crimea, the Caucasus, and south of the <b>Caspian</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{project is}} Baku–Tbilisi–Kars railway project, {{which will be}} able to shorten the route via the <b>Caspian</b> <b>Sea</b> by {{bypassing}} Iran. The new railway lines constructed in Kazakhstan will make it shorter. The new route, in this case, will be China–Kazakhstan–Azerbaijan–Georgia–Turkey.|$|E
5|$|The Rus' {{launched}} the first large-scale raid in 913. A fleet of 500 ships reached the southern {{shores of the}} <b>Caspian</b> <b>Sea</b> through the country of the Khazars. In order to secure a peaceful passage through {{the land of the}} Khazars, the Rus' promised the Khazars half of their spoils. They sailed down the Dnieper River into the Black Sea, then into the Sea of Azov, then up the Don River past the Khazar city of Sarkel, and then by a portage reached the Volga, which led them into the <b>Caspian</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E

5|$|P. d. hyrcanus Zarudny and Kudashev, 1916, {{described}} from Gorgan, Iran, {{is found}} {{along the southern}} coast of the <b>Caspian</b> <b>Sea</b> from Gorgan to south-eastern Azerbaijan. It intergrades with P. d. persicus in the Alborz mountains, and with P. d. bibilicus to the west. It is the subspecies with the smallest range.|$|E

5|$|The {{golden jackal}} may have once been tamed in Neolithic Turkey 11,000 years ago, {{as there is}} a {{sculpture}} of a man cradling a jackal found in Göbekli Tepe. French explorers during the 19thcentury noted that people in the Levant kept golden jackals in their homes. The Kalmyk people near the <b>Caspian</b> <b>Sea</b> were known to frequently cross their dogs with jackals, and Balkan shepherds once crossed their sheepdogs with jackals.|$|E
5|$|Having drilled {{his army}} {{for two years}} Corbulo, despite this misadventure, was ready. He had three legions at his {{disposal}} (III Gallica and VI Ferrata from Syria and IV Scythica), to which were added {{a large number of}} auxiliaries and allied contingents from Eastern client kings like Aristobulus of Lesser Armenia and Polemon II of Pontus. The situation was furthermore favorable to the Romans: Vologases faced a serious revolt by the Hyrcanians in the region of the <b>Caspian</b> <b>Sea</b> as well as incursions of Dahae and Sacae nomads from Central Asia, and was unable to support his brother.|$|E

5|$|Horses occur {{naturally}} on the steppes of Central Asia, {{and their}} domestication, around 3,000 BC in the Black Sea and <b>Caspian</b> <b>Sea</b> region, was originally {{as a source}} of meat; use as pack animals and for riding followed. Around the same time, the wild ass was being tamed in Egypt. Camels were domesticated soon after this, with the Bactrian camel in Mongolia and the Arabian camel becoming beasts of burden. By 1000 BC, caravans of Arabian camels were linking India with Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Syrrhaptes {{are found in the}} steppes of central Asia. Their range extends from the <b>Caspian</b> <b>Sea</b> through {{southern}} Siberia, Tibet and Mongolia to northern and central China. They are normally resident, but Pallas's sandgrouse can be locally migratory and very occasionally is irruptive, appearing in areas well outside its normal range. This happened in 1863 and 1888, and a major irruption took place in 1908 when many birds were seen as far afield as Ireland and the United Kingdom where they bred in Yorkshire and Moray.|$|E
5|$|The first Caspian raid of the Rus' {{occurred}} {{sometime in}} the reign of Hasan ibn Zaid, ruler of Tabaristan between 864 and 884. The Rus' sailed into the <b>Caspian</b> <b>Sea</b> and unsuccessfully attacked its eastern shore at Abaskun. This raid was probably on a very small scale. The second raid took place in 909 or 910 and was likewise aimed at Abaskun; just like the previous attack, this expedition was a minor one with only sixteen ships participating in it. The third minor raid took place in 911 or 912.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{subspecies}} {{of the great}} spotted woodpecker recognised by different authors varies widely from as few as 14 to nearly 30. This is largely because changes are clinal with many intermediate forms. However, mitochondrial DNA data suggests that the <b>Caspian</b> <b>Sea</b> region's Dendrocopus major poelzami, Japanese D. m. japonicus and Chinese D. m. cabanisi may all merit full species status. Despite its distinctive appearance, D. m. canariensis from Tenerife in the Canary Islands appears to be {{closely related to the}} nominate subspecies D. m. major.|$|E
5|$|Cassini {{photographs}} {{have led}} to other significant discoveries. They have revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring, outside the brighter main rings of Saturn and inside the G and Erings. The source of this ring is hypothesized to be the crashing of a meteoroid off Janus and Epimetheus. In July 2006, Cassini images provided evidence of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan's north pole, the presence of which were confirmed in January 2007. In March 2007, additional images near Titan's north pole revealed hydrocarbon seas, the largest of which is almost {{the size of the}} <b>Caspian</b> <b>Sea.</b> In October 2006, the probe detected an 8,000km diameter cyclone-like storm with an eyewall at Saturn's south pole.|$|E
5|$|During {{their next}} {{expedition}} in 943, the Rus' captured Bardha'a, {{the capital of}} Arran, in the modern-day Republic of Azerbaijan. The Rus' stayed there for several months, killing many inhabitants {{of the city and}} amassing substantial plunder. It was only an outbreak of dysentery among the Rus' that forced them to depart with their spoils. Sviatoslav, prince of Kiev, commanded the next attack, which destroyed the Khazar state in 965. Sviatoslav's campaign established the Rus's hold on the north-south trade routes, helping to alter the demographics of the region. Raids continued through the time period with the last Scandinavian attempt to reestablish the route to the <b>Caspian</b> <b>Sea</b> taking place in 1041 by Ingvar the Far-Travelled.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1960s, {{populations of}} the Caucasian jungle cat living along the <b>Caspian</b> <b>Sea</b> and in the Caucasus range states have been rapidly declining. Only small populations persist today. There has been no record in the Astrakhan Nature Reserve in the Volga Delta since the 1980s. The jungle cat is rare in the Middle East. In Jordan, it is highly {{affected}} by the expansion of agricultural areas around the river beds of Yarmouk and Jordan rivers, where farmers hunted and poisoned jungle cats for attacking poultry. It is also considered rare and threatened in Afghanistan. India exported jungle cat skins in large numbers, until this was banned in 1979; some illegal trade, however, continues in the country, {{as well as in}} Egypt and Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Soviet Strike is set {{after the}} {{disintegration}} of the Soviet Union, and takes place in a fictionalised Russia, Eastern Europe and around the <b>Caspian</b> <b>Sea.</b> The player pilots an Apache helicopter and battles with the forces of Shadowman, a renegade ex-Communist figure. Like its predecessors, the game features shooting action mixed with strategic management of fuel and ammunition, but has more authentic 3D graphics, as well as a modified overhead - as opposed to isometric - perspective. The game also features a more realistic enemy artificial intelligence and environment. Critics received the game positively, praising the graphics and full motion video, while commentary on the gameplay and difficulty was more mixed.|$|E
5|$|The {{independence}} of the Turkic states of the Soviet Union in 1991, with which Turkey shares a common cultural and linguistic heritage, allowed Turkey to extend its economic and political relations deep into Central Asia, thus enabling {{the completion of a}} multi-billion-dollar oil and natural gas pipeline from Baku in Azerbaijan to the port of Ceyhan in Turkey. The Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline forms part of Turkey's foreign policy strategy to become an energy conduit from the <b>Caspian</b> <b>Sea</b> basin to Europe. However, in 1993, Turkey sealed its land border with Armenia in a gesture of support to Azerbaijan (a Turkic state in the Caucasus region) during the Nagorno-Karabakh War, and it remains closed.|$|E
