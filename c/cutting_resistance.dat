40|$|This is {{a report}} on <b>cutting</b> <b>resistance</b> {{examined}} in various cases of hot machining of metallic materials. Three kinds of metallic materials used in this experiment were S 45 C carbon steel, 18 - 8 stainless steel, and 13 Cr stainless steel, whose tools had plus rake and minus one.

In other words, the <b>cutting</b> <b>resistance</b> decreases {{and at the same}} time the vibration does as well, and the state of cutting is steady. 2) In case of 18 - 8 stainless steel the heating effect hardly comes about in high speed.

40|$|A forced oscillatory {{soil cutting}} model was {{proposed}} with {{consideration for the}} energy requirement of the oscillator system and the soil <b>cutting</b> <b>resistance</b> related to the drawbar power of the tractor. A comparison between energy consumption in the cutting process for oscillatory and non-oscillatory cases was presented. Two sources of energy provide the required energy to the oscillatory soil cutting process: the oscillator driver and the tractor drawbar power. An optimum frequency was suggested for a given condition to realize a more effective soil cutting process. A tillage tool operating on agricultural soil was considered as a cantilever beam subjected to the fluctuating soil <b>cutting</b> <b>resistance.</b> A finite element model was developed to simulate {{the response of the}} deflection, velocity and acceleration of the shank and tillage tool when the soil resistance was applied {{at the end of the}} shank.

40|$|Abstract: A new {{extension}} of the stochastic linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) regulator problem is developed and used {{for the design of}} new suboptimal cross-coupling controllers for machine tool drives. This new extension allowed us to combine both the drive and the cutting dynamics into a unified model driven by the static and the dynamic portions of the cutting force. The dynamic portion of the cutting force is considered as a stochastic random process in end milling contouring processes. The outputs of the axes are corrected by the cutting tool deflections which result from the <b>cutting</b> force–workpiece <b>resistance</b> interactive dynamics.

Continuous monitoring in an objective and qualitative manner is important to determine the status of implant stability. Implant stability is measured at two different stages: Primary and secondary.

Secondary stability is developed from regeneration and remodeling of the bone and tissue around the implant after insertion and affected by the primary stability, bone formation and remodelling.

Concerning the longwall mining in China, the “masonry beam theory” (MBT) was first proposed in the 1960 s, illustrating that the transmission and equilibrium method of overburden pressure using reserved coal pillar in mined-out areas can be realized. This forms the so-called “ 121 mining method”, which lays a solid foundation for development of mining science and technology in China. The “transfer rock beam theory” (TRBT) proposed in the 1980 s gives a further understanding for the transmission path of stope overburden pressure and pressure distribution in high-stress areas. In this regard, the advanced 121 mining method was proposed with smaller coal pillar for excavation design, making significant contributions to improvement of the coal recovery rate in that era. In the 21 st century, the traditional mining technologies faced great challenges and, under the theoretical developments pioneered by Profs. Minggao Qian and Zhenqi Song, the “cutting cantilever beam theory” (CCBT) was proposed in 2008. After that the 110 mining method is formulated subsequently, namely one stope face, after the first mining cycle, needs one advanced gateway excavation, while the other one is automatically formed during the last mining cycle without coal pillars left in the mining area.

The values for women were 400 and 740 mg, respectively. The participants also used ephedrine and hydrochlorothiazide during the <b>cutting</b> phase. <b>Resistance</b> training was designed to train each muscle once per week and all participants performed aerobic exercise in the fasted state in order to reduce body fat. During the bulking phase, bodybuilders ingested ~ 2. 5 g of protein/kg of body weight. During the cutting phase, protein ingestion increased to ~ 3 g/kg and carbohydrate ingestion decreased by 10 – 20 %. During all phases, fat ingestion corresponded to ~ 15 % of the calories ingested. The supplements used were whey protein, chromium picolinate, omega 3 fatty acids, branched chain amino acids, poly-vitamins, glutamine and caffeine. The men also used creatine in the bulking phase. In general, the participants gained large amounts of fat-free mass during the bulking phase; however, much of that fat-free mass was lost during the cutting phase along with fat mass. Based on our analysis, we recommend an evidence-based approach by people involved in bodybuilding, with the adoption of a more balanced and less artificial diet.
