30|$|The ballast layer, {{filled with}} fine {{particles}} like blown sand, {{is one of}} the important problems of ballasted railway tracks in desert areas. Blown sand, as a <b>contaminator</b> of ballast layer, increases track stiffness and may cause serious damage to sleepers, pads, rails, and vehicles. In this paper, the effects of increasing track stiffness due to windy sands in the ballast layer and the train induced vibrations due to this phenomenon were studied. Based on field studies in a desert area in Iran, a two-dimensional finite/infinite element model for a railway track with plane strain condition was analyzed using the software ABAQUS, and the track vibrations were examined by changing the values of stiffness of ballast layer. Vibrations caused by the load of train at different distances from the cross-section of track were investigated, and the values of vertical vibration displacement, velocity, and acceleration were calculated. Results show that acceleration values of vertical vibration increase with the increasing of ballast layer stiffness caused by the filling of sand, while the vertical vibration velocity of track and the induced ground displacement decrease. The farther the distance from the source of vibration, the less the displacement, velocity, and acceleration. In addition, the methods for reducing train-induced vibrations were introduced.|$|E

Our study combined the use of conventional and molecular epidemic, logical tools to determine the role of dogs in transmission of gastrointestinal (GI) parasites such as hookworms, Giardia and Ascaris in a parasite endemic teagrowing community in northeast India. A highly sensitive and specific molecular tool was developed to detect and differentiate the zoonotic species of canine hookworm eggs directly from faeces.

40|$|Mass drug {{administration}} (MDA) of praziquantel {{has been the}} intervention of choice against schistosomiasis but with limited success in interrupting the transmission. The development of anti-Schistosoma vaccines is underway. Our objective is to quantify the population-level impact of anti-Schistosoma vaccines when administered alone and in combination with mass {{drug administration}} (MDA) and determine factors in vaccine design and public health implementation that optimize vaccination role in schistosomiasis control and elimination. We developed a deterministic compartmental model simulation of schistosomiasis transmission in a high-risk Kenyan community, including stratification by age, parasite burden, and vaccination status. The modeled schistosomiasis vaccines differed in terms of vaccine duration of protection (durability) and three biological efficacies. These are vaccine susceptibility effect (SE) of reducing person's susceptibility to Schistosoma acquisition, vaccine mortality effect (ME) of reducing established worm burden and vaccine fecundity effect (FE) of reducing egg release by mature worms. We quantified the population-level impact of vaccination over two decades under diverse vaccination schemes (childhood vs. mass campaigns), with different age-targeting scenarios, different risk settings, and with combined intervention with MDA. We also assessed the sensitivity of our predictions to uncertainties in model parameters. Over two decades, our base case vaccine with 80 % SE, FE, and ME efficacies, 10 years' durability, provided by mass vaccination every 10 years, reduced host prevalence, mean intensity, incidence, and patent snail prevalence to 31 %, 20 eggs/ 10 -ml sample/person, 0. 87 worm/person-year, and 0. 74 %, from endemic-state values of 71 %, 152, 3. 3, and 0. 98 %, respectively. Lower impact was found when coverage did not encompass all potential <b>contaminators,</b> and childhood-only vaccination schemes showed delayed and lower impact. In lower prevalence settings, the base case vaccine generated a proportionately smaller impact. A substantially larger vaccine program effect was generated when MDA + mass vaccination was provided every 5 years, which could be achieved by an MDA-only program only if drug was offered annually. Vaccine impact on schistosomiasis transmission was sensitive {{to a number of}} parameters including vaccine efficacies, human contact rates with water, human density, patent snails' rate of patency and lifespan, and force of infection to snails. To be successful a vaccine-based control strategy will need a moderately to highly effective formulation combined with early vaccination of potential <b>contaminators</b> and aggressive coverage in repeated rounds of mass vaccination. Compared to MDA-only program, vaccination combined with MDA accelerates and prolongs the impact by reducing the acquisition of new worms and reducing egg release from residual worms...|$|R

But intramyocellular lipids show a highly inter-individual variability and {{it is obvious that}} different physical conditions of muscles obtain different concentrations of this lipid fraction. Therefore, it sounds a paradox that athletes show a high level of intramyocellular lipids and a high insulin sensitiveness of their muscular tissue. However, the intramyocellular lipids serve as energy donators for the muscular mitochondria. Physical work leads to a decrease in intramyocellular lipids. Interestingly, untrained patients suffering from type- 2 diabetes with peripheral muscular insulin resistance show a high level of intramyocellular lipids too [28, 29]. In the end, many parameters influence the level of intramyocellular lipids, e.g. dietary nutrition, sex, gender, body mass index and the oxygen content of tissue. Additionally, modern spectroscopic techniques deliver the possibility of spatially visualising the evaluated resonance peaks with the aid of parametric colour maps. Several groups are researching 13 C-MR spectroscopy. The nucleus plays an important part in muscle physiology and pathophysiology [30, 31].

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} pilot decontamination, {{which does not}} require inter-cell {{coordination}} {{and is able to}} exploit past pilot signals. It is based on pilot sequence hopping performed within each cell. Pilot sequence hopping means that every user chooses a new pilot sequence in each time slot. Thus, in every time slot, the pilot signal of a user is contaminated by a different set of interfering users, which means channel estimation is affected by a different set of interfering channels. If channel estimation is carried out based solely on the pilot sequence of the current slot, then pilot sequence hopping does not bring any gain. The key in our solution is a channel estimation that incorporates multiple time slots so that it can benefit from randomization of the pilot contamination. Recent work utilizing temporal correlation for channel estimation is found in [13], although not in combination with pilot hopping and not with the purpose of mitigating pilot contamination. Random selection of pilot sequences is also explored in [14] and [15]. Both works consider the random access problem in cellular networks. In [14], pilot contamination is avoided through a distributed collision detection algorithm, which enables users with weak channels to detect that they are contaminators of a user with a strong channel and as a result postpone their transmission. The work in [15] considers codeword transmissions that are spread across multiple time slots, each with a different <b>contaminator.</b> This decorrelates the contamination within a single codeword, which improves performance.|$|E

The greatest number of studies {{has been carried out}} on contaminations with heavy metals, followed by pesticides, radionuclides and other substances. Pb, Cd and Zn have been the most looked for metals. Zn and Cd have been mainly deposited {{on the surface of the}} bee body while Ni, Cd, Pb and Co have been released with the excrements most often. In all cases of pesticide implementation certain amounts of them have been always accumulated in the bees and their products. According to the researchers, pollutants accumulate in the bees and their products at different extents. Heavy metals and pesticides have been established in the bodies of honey bees in larger quantities in comparison to honey. Most of the authors reported that bee honey is a suitable tool for monitoring pollution with heavy metals and pesticides but the opposite assertions have been also expressed. A suggestion for the presence of a bio-barrier function of the bee organism against <b>contaminators</b> has been forwarded. It has been established that pollen is the most suitable indicator for radioactive pollution. As a whole, the present review shows that bees and their products are suitable models for bio-monitoring of the environmental pollution of different nature. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{elucidate}} the distribution and possible transmission routes of Toxocara spp. infection in Estonia. Out of 454 faecal and sand samples collected from park lawns and sandpits in the town of Tartu, 19 were Toxocara positive (4. 2 %). Out of the 45 sandpit samples 17. 8 % were Toxocara positive. Cat faeces was found in 21 sandpit samples. Parasitological necropsies were performed on 41 euthanised stray dogs and 27 cats in the Tallinn Dog Home. Additionally, 13 wild free-roaming brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) were captured from the Tallinn Dog Home territory, necropsied and studied for the presence of Toxocara larvae. Toxocara canis adults were found in 14. 6 % of the dogs and Toxocara cati (syn. mystax) adults in the small intestines of 48. 2 % of the cats examined. Larval infection was detected in the kidney and liver in 5 dogs (12. 2 %). Our study demonstrated only low-level larval Toxocara infections in adult dogs. Toxocara larvae were not found in cats and brown rats. According to the results of this study, cats more often carry Toxocara infection than dogs. Under our conditions, stray and free-roaming cats are the main <b>contaminators</b> of the environment with Toxocara eggs. Children playing in sandpits are the main risk group for larval toxocarosis...|$|R

The rural aqueduct Acuacombia {{which is}} located in “Combia Baja” receives the water from “San Vicente, Pavas, Bejucos and Pital” streams which could be affected by permanent <b>contaminators</b> coming from the domestic, agricultural and pecuary activities in the area, and also, due to the natural phenomenons as landslide, tremors or strong rains. This facts show the necessity of the elaboration of a contingence plan, which gave as result to identify the threaten and vulnerable zones not only the basin of the river {{but also in the}} aqueduct supply system. On the other hand it is important to follow rules which reduce and prevent the risk {{of the quality of the}} water for human consume at the same time some actions should be taken in the case of an emergency. In this way we make sure the residents of “Combia Baja” have the continuity of the service...|$|R
