40|$|This {{recording}} is an edited {{compilation of}} video from recordings made {{as part of}} the Dalabon Way of Life project (AIATSIS Research Grant 2003 / 6849). It is compiled on a theme of 'Artefacts - weaving'. The original recordings were created during August - December 2003. The edited compilations (aka 'Rough Cuts' files) were also created during that period. The Rough Cuts compilations are organised according to theme (e. g. weaving, fishing, bush tucker etc.) and comprise extractions of all Dalabon speech found in the original recordings, as well as relevant visual footage. This was for the purpose of creating (much shorter) themed videos, and for transcription. Transcription of the Rough <b>Cuts</b> <b>files</b> was mainly undertaken during 2004, with the assistance of Queenie Brennan. Annotations are not typically based on intonation units (rather, larger conceptual units such as 'sentences'), and there are likely to be many transcription errors, as these transcriptions were done early in my work on Dalabon. I am not working actively on correcting these transcriptions presently. Sarah Cutfield, May 2010...|$|R

50|$|Dufour wears acrylic {{artificial}} fingernails on each {{finger of}} his right hand, aside from his thumb. The nails help to create a crisp, clean sound. Regarding these nails, he buys commonly available acrylic nails from a store, and then cuts them down to size.

As is commonly seen, Dufour has two rings on his right index and ring finger. These are his wedding and engagement rings. The reason he wears them on his right hand is so that they do not hit the neck of the guitar while he plays. The rings serve no purpose in his playing.|$|R
