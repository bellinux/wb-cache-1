Each picture of Picabia [...] "has a definite existence, the limits of which are set by the title". Picabia's paintings were so far from a priori abstractions that [...] "the painter <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> history of each one of them. Dance at the Spring is simply the expression of a plastic emotion experienced spontaneously near Naples".|$|E

They reported withdrawal symptoms, as well as acts of violence and self-harm that they believed were attributable to paroxetine. During this programme, Benbow told Jofre: [...] "We have been asked by the regulatory authorities to provide all our information related to suicides and I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> data that we provide to them clearly shows no link between Seroxat and {{an increased risk of}} suicideâ€”no link." ...|$|E

After her death, Medrano's {{husband and the}} father of her son said he felt the segment Grace did was cruel and added [...] "The things people said were horrible. It shows that cyberbullying happens to adults, too." [...] Following Melinda Duckett's suicide, this is the second suicide to which Grace has been linked. On January 4, 2012, a lawsuit against CNN brought by Medrano's family was settled, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> case was settled in principle two weeks ago," [...] said personal injury attorney Michael Padden.

2500|$|Holloway {{operated}} his battleship {{with characteristic}} flair, recalled Rear Admiral Ralph Kirk James, {{who had been}} the maintenance officer responsible for repair work on damaged ships at Manus when Iowa arrived at that base to fix shafting problems on 25 December 1944. [...] "Jimmy Holloway was charging up the harbor with this big battleship, the biggest I'd seen, and I was getting more and more nervous." [...] Alarmed, James warned Holloway to reduce his speed before entering the drydock. [...] "'Oh no,' [...] said...He got the ship just about halfway into the dry dock when he ordered full speed astern. The Iowa shook like a damned destroyer and stopped just where she was supposed to be." [...] Unfortunately, the backwash from the engine reversal swept away the drydock support blocks from underneath the ship, and James and his crew had to spend an extra three hours resetting the blocks before Iowa could dock. Afterward, James discovered a grey streak in his hair. [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> moment it was born: when Holloway pulled his high-speed throttle-jockey stunt on me." ...|$|E
