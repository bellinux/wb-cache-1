40|$|Air-stirring motors {{are often}} viewed with {{disparagement}} {{in the laboratory}} because of the rather large amount of noise which attends their use. This noise may be traced to four sources: (1) that arising from the turbulent discharge of air from· the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>lines</b> into tubing connecting with the motor; (2) that due to air rushing through the pipes and the connecting tubing; (3) that inherent {{in the use of}} an air motor, i. e. bearing noise and the clear tone of audio-frequency which is associated with all turbines; and (4) that resulting from the air rushing out of the small escape ports generally provided in the flat surface on top of the motor. Of these sources, the first and fourth are by far the most important because of both the intensity and the raucous character of the noise arising from them. The devices suggested here have been found very useful in reducing to a very large extent the noise from these two sources. The second and third sources enumerated are of smaller importance, but their contribution to the total noise may be minimized by suitable choice of connective tubing and by judicious oiling...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Navy Public Works Center San Diego (PWCSD) was {{concerned}} about the accuracy of various flow meters on steam and <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>lines</b> serving Naval facilities in San Diego, California. The flow meters had experienced various inconsistencies that had not been resolved prior to July 1993. Pacific Northwest Laboratory, Richland, Washington, evaluated the operation of 10 out of 79 steam and compressed air flow meters at PWCSD. The evaluation was limited to analysis of historical information and review of existing operating procedures. On-site investigation of the flow meters was limited to external observations of the flow-sensing equipment and a check of the flow computer program. PNL did not remove installed sensing equipment (i. e., flow meters or temperature or pressure sensors) to evaluate existing condition or check calibration. Although many of the flow meter errors can be traced to improperly normalized readings and to meters improperly compensated for temperature and pressure, lack of regular maintenance, including proper calibration, was evidenced throughout this study. A strict calibration schedule should be established for all steam and air flow meters, including calibration of the temperature sensor, pressure sensor, and flow turbine. It is recommended that the most crucial flow meters (such as the 10 evaluated in this study) be calibrated yearly. The remaining 69 flow meters could be placed on a staggered, biyearly calibration schedule. Calibration should be done by qualified personnel only. Improper calibration is often worse than no calibration at all. An outside firm is recommended to be contracted with to perform all maintenance and calibration on flow meters at the Naval facilities. Use of an outside firm would better facilitate regular, reliable calibration while removing liability for damaged parts...|$|E
40|$|Research on single-model {{assembly}} line balancing has produced several good algorithms for solving large problems. All these algorithms, however, generate just one {{solution to the}} balancing problem. With these, line designers wishing to investigate alternative station combinations of work elements are forced to do so manually. This paper concerns an algorithm (MUST) which generates alternative solutions of equal quality for single-model {{assembly line}} balancing problems. The method {{is based on the}} Mansoor-Yadin algorithm and in its optimum seeking form, MUST generates all existing optimal balances in a single pass. Three heuristics, used singularly or together, are introduced for solving the larger balancing problems. These are designed to produce about 100 different balance solutions of equal quality at each pass. MUST has been successfully used in balancing assembly lines having up to 140 work elements with widely differing precedence structures. A comparison of this method with MALB, one of the most efficient known heuristic methods, results in MUST dominating or equalling MALB in every case. Reasonable computation times (average 125. 4 sec. [...] IBM 370 / 168) and core usage are achieved through the use of advanced computation methods. The need to explore alternative station combinations may arise in several ways [...] for example, the line designer may prefer (but not require) that certain work elements be allocated to a common station either because of: access to materials handling and storage facilities, service availability (e. g., <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>lines),</b> use of common tools or operator skills, etc. Alternatively, minor adjustments to the line may be required between adjacent stations in order to alleviate conditions at one station which exhibits excessive variability in its performance times. The generation of multiple solutions of equal efficiency adds a new dimension to the quality of balancing effectiveness, enabling the line designer to select the alternative that best suits his requirements. production/scheduling: line balancing, production/scheduling, networks/graphs...|$|E
