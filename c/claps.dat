5|$|At {{the end of}} the play, {{the actors}} file out slowly (most {{important}} first, with gaps between actors), and while they are on the bridge (hashigakari), the audience <b>claps</b> restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return to the stage after having left. A play may end with the shite character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one <b>claps</b> as the character exits.|$|E
5|$|After the 1st verse and chorus, {{there is}} an a cappella moment, in which Jackson {{breathes}} to the drums and the bass, then the strings, then spins, drops down and <b>claps,</b> then he main song starts with the 2nd verse.|$|E

5|$|The album's {{songs are}} characterised by metronomic pop, vocal harmonies, hand <b>claps,</b> {{prominent}} electric guitar riffs, bright synthesizers, a homogeneous sound and message, and rotations of lead vocals. The members' voices are presented individually on the record, and its lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what {{make a person}} unique, commitment, jealousy, and longing for past significant others. Take Me Home garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production, while criticism hinged on its generic, rushed nature.|$|E
5|$|The Front of the Stage is open'd, and the Band of 24 Violins, {{with the}} Harpsicals and Theorbo's which {{accompany}} the Voices, are plac'd between the Pit and the Stage. While the Overture is playing, the Curtain rises, and discovers a new Frontispiece, joyn'd {{to the great}} Pylasters, {{on each side of}} the Stage... Behind this is the Scene, which represents a thick Cloudy Sky, a very Rocky Coast, and a Tempestuous Sea in perpetual Agitation. This Tempest (suppos'd to be rais'd by Magick) has many dreadful Objects in it, as several Spirits in horrid shapes flying down amongst the Sailers, then rising and crossing in the Air. And when the Ship is sinking, the whole House is darken'd, and a shower of Fire falls upon 'em. This is accompanied with Lightning, and several <b>Claps</b> of Thunder, to the end of the Storm.|$|E

25|$|A single {{electronic}} kit can (via its module or software) {{simulate the}} sounds of countless acoustic kits and instruments/effects. A drummer in a cover band or wedding band can switch instantly, for instance, between a vintage jazz drum kit and a powerful maple rock kit. Other options include congas, piano, guitar, brushes, orchestral timpani, gongs or even add hand <b>claps</b> or sound effects such as a sirens. In the 2010s, many non-musical samples and effects are available. It is therefore possible to achieve much more than one can with an acoustic kit alone and one has to transport significantly less kit to play {{a wide variety of}} sounds and instruments.|$|E
25|$|In March 2015, Lara criticised the ICC for fining Pakistani cricket player Wahab Riaz {{after his}} 'shocking spell', {{as it was}} dubbed, when he managed to puzzle Australian player Shane Watson by giving him sarcastic <b>claps,</b> {{throwing}} the ball at him and sending him flying kisses. Watson was unable to cope with that and Riaz's high-quality bowling in the 2015 ICC World Cup. The team lost but Riaz was fined 50% of his match fee for his behaviour. Lara criticised this decision by the ICC {{and said it was}} 'uncalled for'. He said it was the only highlights of the game and said he would pay the fine himself. He said he wanted to meet Riaz himself.|$|E
25|$|Visitors to a Shinto shrine {{follow a}} {{purification}} ritual before presenting {{themselves to the}} kami. This ritual begins with hand washing, and swallowing and later spitting {{a small amount of}} water in front of the shrine to purify the body, heart, and mind. Once this is complete they turn their focus to gaining the kami’s attention. The traditional method of doing this is to bow twice, clap twice and bow again, alerting the kami to their presence and desire to commune with them. During the last bow, the supplicant offers words of gratitude and praise to the kami; if they are offering a prayer for aid they will also state their name and address. After the prayer and/or worship they repeat the two bows, two <b>claps</b> and a final bow in conclusion.|$|E

25|$|The general {{process for}} a typical {{courtship}} interaction begins when a male flies and lands near a perching female, who is most likely perched on a host plant, such as several species of the Passiflora genus. Once the male has landed, the male assumes a position next to the female with their heads together and with their bodies aligned at a 45-degree angle. At this time, the male engages in a specific action called the wing clap display in which the male continuously <b>claps</b> its wings open and closed. During this time, the antennae of the female are placed between the opening and closing wings. After the male ceases wing movement, the male butterfly will move into a position that facilitates genital contact with the female. The average duration of the copulation process including the wing clap display is approximately 11 seconds.|$|E
25|$|The club sold 20,000 pink replica jerseys in 2005–06. Guazzini {{also had}} more than 10,000 pink flags manufactured, which were {{scattered}} on the seats at the Stade de France for the two games against Toulouse and Biarritz. Two new jerseys were introduced {{at the beginning of}} the 2006–07 season. A pink one, designed by fashion designer Kenzo, was used for Stade's home debut against Montpellier on 19 August 2006. A new navy blue one was used for the second home game against Bayonne on 9 September 2006, and has raised questions as it sports big pink lilies, green flashes and green numbers in the back (green is not a club colour). It had been officially presented to the players a few minutes before the game and received by them with cheers and <b>claps.</b> Only wing Christophe Dominici had been allowed to see it beforehand. The radio-controlled car used to bring the tee to the kicker was painted in pink for the 2006–07 season.|$|E
25|$|The folk {{traditions of}} Gujarat include bhavai and raas-garba. Bhavai is a folk theatre; it is partly {{entertainment}} and partly ritual, and {{is dedicated to}} Amba. The raas-garba is a folk dance done as a celebration of Navratri by Gujarati people. The folk costume of this dance is chaniya choli for women and kedia for men. Different styles and steps of garba include dodhiyu, simple five, simple seven, popatiyu, trikoniya (hand movement which forms an imagery triangle), lehree, tran taali, butterfly, hudo, two <b>claps</b> and many more Sheri garba {{is one of the}} oldest form of garba where all the ladies wear red patola sari and sing along while dancing.It is a very graceful form of garba. Makar Sankranti is a festival where people of Gujarat fly kites. In Gujarat, from December through to Makar Sankranti, people start enjoying kite flying. Undhiyu, a special dish made of various vegetables, is a must-have of Gujarati people on Makar Sankranti. Surat is especially well known for the strong string which is made by applying glass powder on the row thread to provide it a cutting edge.|$|E
