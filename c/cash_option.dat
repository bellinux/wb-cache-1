500|$|The Virginia Lottery gives top-prize {{winners of}} certain games {{a choice of}} cash or annuity. When a Virginia top-prize winner of Mega Millions, Powerball or Cash4Life is claimed, the Lottery {{purchases}} sufficient U.S. Government bonds to cover the prize. (A <b>cash</b> <b>option</b> winner of Mega Millions or Powerball receives the [...] "lump sum" [...] in two installments as both games are offered by multiple lotteries.) The actual cash value depends on {{the market value of}} the bonds on the date they are sold. Federal laws require the Lottery to withhold Federal Income Tax on all prizes (whether lump sum or annuity) over $5,000.|$|E
500|$|Mega Millions is {{a drawing}} game played in Virginia {{and most other}} U. S. states (Virginia {{is one of the}} {{original}} six states to first offer the game in 1996 when it was then known as [...] "The Big Game"). Jackpots start at $15 million and grow with each drawing {{in which there is no}} jackpot winner. Drawings are held Tuesdays and Fridays. Players select five numbers, 1 through 75, plus a Mega Ball number, 1 through 15. Players also have the option to use the Megaplier, which increases the ticket price by $1 each but raises the value of any non-jackpot prizes won. A ticket matching all six numbers win the jackpot. The jackpot is pari-mutuel, meaning that if multiple tickets match all six numbers, each of them receives an equal share of the total jackpot. Mega Millions jackpot are offered as an annuity, although a <b>cash</b> <b>option</b> is also available.|$|E
5000|$|... † First-prize <b>cash</b> <b>option</b> is $5,750,000; {{multiple}} winners {{share the}} top prize regardless of payment option(s) chosen.

The <b>cash</b> <b>option</b> amounts are decided by a unanimous {{vote of the}} LFL lotteries; these amounts are posted at least 30 days before the change(s) occur. ‡ Second and third prizes also have liability limits.|$|E

40|$|Corporation (“OCC”) {{filed with}} the Securities and Exchange Commission the {{proposed}} rule change as described herein. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. The proposed rule change would reiterate or modify portions of OCC’s margin rules for options on securities that are subject to a cash merger. When a corporation is acquired by cash merger, each share of stock must be converted into an amount of cash specified in the merger documents. Trading in both the security and in any option on the security ceases on or about the effective date of the merger. OCC has adopted special policies for dealing with any unexpired options on securities that {{are the subject of}} a cash merger (called “cash options”). Currently, when a cash merger occurs, OCC determines, pursuant to OCC By-Law Art. VI § 11, that as of the business day following the effective date of the merger, all short <b>cash</b> <b>options</b> positions become, on exercise, obligations to deliver cash in the amount of the merger price. Thus, the value of an in-the-money option becomes fixed, and the value of an at-themoney option or an out-of-the-money option equals zero. When trading is terminated in <b>cash</b> <b>options,</b> OCC participants are unable to close ou...|$|R

40|$|We ask how CEOs {{should be}} optimally {{compensated}} to make value-maximizing decisions that may cost them their jobs. Examples are {{the decision to}} shut down the firm, to give up resistance against a sale or takeover, or to acknowledge failure of the firm’s current business strategy, thus allowing the board to hire a new CEO with a different managerial vision. We find that the CEO’s optimal compensation package consists of <b>cash,</b> <b>options</b> grants, and severance pay. As opportunities to reallocate firm assets become more valuable, shareholders must cede substantial rents to the CEO in the form of more valuable option grants and severance pay. Restrictions on either the size or the form of the CEO’s pay may destroy value and impede efficient reallocations of assets across industries...|$|R
