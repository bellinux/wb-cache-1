I wanted to found a method that consumes small amount of water and still {{will be able to}} produce healthy plant. I designed a schedule that really consumes small amount of water and still was able to harvest. My reason for investigating the optimum irrigation level is that I found that some of the LEDCs has a very high global hunger index value. Also these LEDCs has significantly low wheat production and I believed as I thought about my experiment I might help this production rate as I found a optimum irrigation level efficient for the growth of <b>common</b> <b>wheat.</b> I mostly interviewed with my aunt Zehra Gözalan, who is an agricultural architect as I need information about the <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>seeds</b> behaviors and properties.

40|$|Spelt wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Thell) (spelta group) is an ancient, hulled, {{specialty}} wheat {{which is}} presently grown {{on a limited}} scale as a fall-sown crop in Western Europe. Little {{is known about the}} agronomics and growth characteristics of spring spelt, a potential specialty wheat for western Canada. The main objectives of this study were to compare the yield potential and growth characteristics of spring spelt wheat to that of <b>common</b> spring <b>wheat</b> (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Thell) in central Saskatchewan, using growth analysis; to investigate the response of spring spelt to seeding date; and to determine the effect of the hulls of spelt on seedling emergence and establishment under adverse temperature and moisture conditions. The seeding rate and growth analysis experiment was conducted in the field using two spring spelt cultivars (CDC Bavaria and PGR 8801) and a <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivar (Katepwa) at four seeding rates ranging from 150 to 450 seeds/m 2 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, in 1995 and 1996. The response of spring spelt and <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> to <b>seeding</b> date was measured from late April to early June under field conditions over two years. The role of spelt hulls on seed germination, seedling emergence and crop establishment was studied under field conditions using an early (late April) and a late (early June) date of seeding over two years. Seed germination, seedling establishment and seed water uptake were studied under controlled environment conditions at water potentials ranging from 0 to - 1. 8 MPa, at temperatures of 9, 16 and 23 °C. The field studies indicated that spring spelt can produce grain yield comparable to <b>common</b> <b>wheat.</b> The same <b>seeding</b> rate as <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> (150 to 250 seeds/m 2) can be used for spring spelt wheat in central Saskatchewan. Spring spelt has a higher leaf area index (LAI), leaf area duration (LAD) and crop growth rate (CGR) than <b>common</b> <b>wheat,</b> giving rise to 24 per cent higher biological yield for spring spelt compared to that of <b>common</b> <b>wheat.</b> Optimal <b>seeding</b> date for spring spelt is late April to early May; with later seeding spring spelt's grain yield tends to decrease. Seedling establishment for spring spelt is lower and less stable than <b>common</b> <b>wheat,</b> though this variation in seedling plant density does not influence the final grain yield. Controlled environment studies indicated that the hull of spring spelt wheat acts as an obstacle to water uptake, leading to an approximate 25 per cent slower water uptake rate compared to naked seeds. The hull has negative impact on seed germination and seedling emergence. The negative impact of the hull on seed water uptake, seed germination and seedling emergence increases under drought conditions. Thus, only under sufficiently wet soil conditions may using hulled seed as the propagule lead to comparable establishment of spring spelt relative to <b>common</b> <b>wheat.</b> In conclusion, spring spelt can be grown successfully in central Saskatchewan, producing a comparable grain yield to <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> provided it is seeded before mid-May...|$|R
40|$|Lipoxygenases (LOXs) are key enzymes catalyzing the {{oxidation}} of polyunsaturated fatty acids, {{and play}} an important role in grain storage, seed vigor and bread-making. In this study, we report cloning and characterization of TaLOX 3, the homolog gene of barley LoxB, from <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> (Triticum aestivum L.). The full-length cDNA sequence of TaLOX 3 had an open reading frame of 2, 634 bp encoding a deduced polypeptide of 878 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 99, 549. 79 Da and an estimated isoelectric point of 6. 26. TaLOX 3 was assigned to chromosome 4 A. The multiple alignment result showed that TaLOX 3 protein had an identity of 91. 3 % to barley LOX 3 (encoded by LoxB). Profile analyses revealed that the three TaLOX genes are expressed in unique patterns in various organs. Furthermore, the expression profiles of the TaLOX 3 gene were determined by q-PCR using the high and low seed LOX activity of different wheat varieties. The result showed that TaLOX 3 transcript levels increased significantly during the development of wheat grain. Further analysis indicated genotypes with high LOX activity were associated with higher expression levels than the low LOX activity ones. This indicates that TaLOX 3 may contribute to the total LOX activity in <b>common</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>seeds.</b> Phylogenetic analysis conducted with LOXs from rice, maize, Brachypodium distachyon genome, barley and <b>wheat</b> <b>seeds</b> (TaLOX 1, TaLOX 2 and TaLOX 3) revealed that LOXs could be well resolved into two clades (G 1 and G 2). Moreover, G 1 can be divided to three subgroups, with each TaLOX in one subgroup. Collectively, these results can extent our knowledge of the molecular characterization of LOXs, and will provide a valuable resource for wheat quality improvement and breeding.

Type of colony observed on the seeds is important for the differentiation between the fungus species. Bipolaris sorokiniana presented black colonies, which were well-adherent to the seeds, whereas B. bicolor presented grayish, aerial, cotton-like colonies. The size of the conidia also differed in length and width, and B. bicolor presented the smallest dimensions. In relation to septa, B. bicolor conidia presented deep ones, with dark color bases, but seldom presented dark apex. Bipolaris sorokiniana presented homogenous color.

40|$|Summary. Throughout {{the course}} of {{development}} <b>wheat</b> <b>seeds</b> undergo changes in both fresh and dry weight and in moisture content. Between 10 and 20 DAF, both fresh and dry weights increase very rapidly. Accumulation of dry matter ceases {{at the same time}} as the seed dried out at 40 DAF. The natural desiccation period for <b>wheat</b> <b>seeds</b> is established between 30 and 40 DAF. Freshly harvested <b>wheat</b> <b>seeds</b> are capable of germinating during the period between 20 and 30 DAF but germinating capacity is very low. Increased frequency of germination along with the increase in seed age was observed in case of artificially desiccated seeds. It is noteworthy that the capacity of desiccated seeds to germinate does not depend on the degree of desiccation but only on their age at harvest time. The amount of water absorbed by desiccated seeds during germination depends on developmental stage of seeds at harvest time. It was established that to the lower initial moisture content of desiccated seeds correspond higher amounts of water absorbed in {{the course of}} germination. Moreover for every investigated phase of seed development there is a determined degree of moisture and the water uptake of desiccated seeds can not overcome this value. Full maturity of field grown <b>wheat</b> <b>seeds</b> was reached at 50 DAF...|$|R
40|$|Investigation {{carried out}} at the Department of Physics, University of Agriculture in Lublin {{consisted}} {{in the application of}} an alternating magnetic field (50 Hz, harmonic vibration) for the biostimulation of <b>wheat</b> <b>seeds.</b> The purpose of research was to define the effect of the magnetic biostimulation on the germination of <b>seeds.</b> The <b>wheat</b> <b>seeds</b> were subjected to 18 different magnetic ex- posure doses. For the next investigation two magnetic exposure doses were selected. On the basis of the research, {{it can be said that}} germination capacity of <b>wheat</b> <b>seeds</b> de- pends on the magnetic exposure dose. The speed of germi- nation of the treated seeds was higher than in the case of untreated ones. The seeds with the highest moisture content and subjected to a higher magnetic exposure dose had the highest speed of germination. Maximum speed of germi- nation for all the studied combinations was observed 35 h after magnetic biostimulation...|$|R
