40|$|From a {{study of}} strongyloides infections in man and animals in this region, it has been determined, in {{confirmation}} of the view of Grassi, Calmette, and others, {{that they are not}} causative factors in the production of diarrhea. The mother worm, however, burrows into the mucosa and deposits her ova there. Certain tissue reactions take place and are evidenced by the cellular proliferation in those portions of the intestines occupied by the nematodes. In animals, there is an associated anemia, not positively attributable to the strongyloides, but, on the other hand, not attributable to any other cause. It is possible that S. stercoralis may cause some degree of anemia in man. The amount is indeterminable in this region among hospital cases on account of the associated hookworm disease or malaria. Portals of entry for various microörganisms are made by the female mother worm and her larvæ in the small intestine, and, while no case of general bacterial infection has been proved to have arisen in this way, its occurrence is possible and highly probable. In the cultures of strongyloides of man, there is among natives, who presumably are infected with purely tropical strains, a very marked predominance of development by the indirect or sexually differentiated mode, in some cases, an absolutely pure culture of the indirect mode larvæ being obtained. There are, however, natives, cultures from whose stools contain from a single filariform larva of the direct phase up to a very definite predominance of this mode. Cultures from natives of the temperate zones contain a marked predominance of the direct phase larvæ. The presence of the filariform (direct mode), larva is perhaps best accounted for by its being an attempt at more perfect parasitism (Stiles). From a correlation of culture study with the results of a histological examination of the invaded mucosa, this explanation of the derivation of the two phases is suggested. The mother worm in the intestinal tract has two kinds of progeny: (a) those expelled into the crypts or lumen, and (b) those imbedded in the intestinal wall. One lot becomes larvæ of either the direct or indirect phase; the other lot of the opposite phase. It appears to me that the intraepithelial cell-developed larvæ furnish the direct phase, while the embryos expelled directly from the mother become the indirect phase larvæ. This will require for its confirmation {{a study of}} cultures in connection with a histological examination of the infected intestinal wall. Cold merely inhibits the development of the larvγaelig; into either the filariform (direct) or into the sexually differentiated adults, and does not alter the anlage. The resistant as well as the infecting form is the filariform larva, and all chemical larvicides must be directed against this form. Thymol and an alkaline <b>cresol</b> <b>resin</b> soap were found to be effective larvicides for the filariform larvæ. Two new strongyloides of the monkey and ant bear are described. Cultures of these nematodes show a predominance of the indirect mode of development...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the residual film thickness of negative photoresist with varied exposure dose after developmemt, namely, the contrast curve, affected by the photoinitiators. Three kinds of photoinitiators (Irgacure 369, Irgacure 907, and Irgacure OXE- 02) were used as studied materials, blending with carboxylated <b>cresol</b> acrylic <b>resin</b> and trimethylolpropane triacrylate in co-solvent of propyleneglycol monomethyl ether acetate and cyclohexanone. As shown in the results, the photoinitiator grouped with oxime ester, such as Irgacure OXE- 02, {{can be used to}} increase the contrast of negative-work photo-resist in the photolithography, and reduce the exposure dose needed for cross-linking reaction due to the more free radicals produced by the photoinitiator with a wider spectral absorption range. This suggests that the contrast curve method may be employed to optimize and integrate the photosensitive polymer in the photolithography process...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the removal of}} polymers with various chemical structures {{and the removal of}} ion-implanted resists using wet ozone. The removal rates of polymers that have carbon-carbon (C–C) double bonds in the main chain were high. The main chain of these polymers may be decomposed. The removal rates of polymers that have C–C double bonds in the side chain were low. The benzene ring in the side chain changes into carboxylic acid, so their ability to dissolve in water increased. The polymers without C–C double bonds were not removed. Removal of B and P ion-implanted resists became difficult with increasing acceleration energy of ions at implantation. The resist with plastic-deformation hardness that was twice as hard as that of nonimplanted resist should be removed similarly to nonimplanted resist. Using TOF-SIMS, we clarified that the molecule of <b>cresol</b> novolak <b>resin</b> was destroyed and carbonized by ion implantation...|$|R
30|$|Organosolv lignin can be {{used for}} PF resin. Ethanol lignin, which is {{obtained}} from ethanol–water pulping, can be applied in the production of adhesives. Ayla reported that a resin composed of 90  % ethanol lignin (isolated from beech or pine wood) and 10  % phenol led to boiling proof bond according to the German Standards [86]. Formacell and Acetocolv lignins from Eucalyptus {{can be used}} in PF resins [19, 87, 88]. Sano and Ichikawa prepared PF <b>resins</b> containing <b>cresol</b> lignin, which was obtained from solvolytic pulping of hardwood chips with aqueous cresols. They showed that at least 90  % of the phenol resins could be replaced by the cresol lignin [89]. During solvolysis using a cresol-water system, a significant amount of cresol (10 – 30  % cresol) was introduced onto lignin, resulting in an improved reactivity towards formaldehyde. This system showed comparable performance to commercial PF <b>resins,</b> however, <b>cresol</b> lignin could not be commercially available. Upon addition of resorcinol to <b>cresol</b> lignin-phenol <b>resins,</b> moderate-temperature setting adhesives (room temperature setting followed by hot press) could be prepared. Sano et al. [90] also reported moderate-temperature setting lignin-based adhesives based on resorcinol and cresol lignin.|$|R
