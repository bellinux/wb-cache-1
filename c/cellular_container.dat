The Challenge and her two sisters Manchester Courage and Concorde were followed from the Tees in 1971 by the Crusade. UK manufacturers supplied 10,000 containers. The four ships each {{had the capacity to}} carry five hundred [...] containers, all of them below deck. A new regular container route started in November 1968, with a twice-weekly service to Montreal, where the containers were transferred to smaller vessels which could navigate to the ports of the Great Lakes.

40|$|Advanced marine design, {{particularly}} in the United States, advocates the use of cross-functional design teams, or Integrated Product Teams (IPT’s), who will undertake a concurrent engineering approach to all phases of ship design. Further, {{the study of the}} world-class Toyota automotive design process has highlighted the potential of a set-based design approach in concurrent engineering to provide a greater probability of achieving a global optimum for the overall design. A hybrid humancomputer agent approach is introduced to facilitate set-based conceptual ship design by a crossfunctional team of naval architects and marine engineers. The disciplinary/technical specialists are organized and tasked as agents within a design network that can be either be co-located or interconnected across the web. Computer agents are introduced between each pair of human design agents to facilitate their communication and negotiation. A systematic market approach, developed in the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA) sponsored Responsible Agents for Product-Process Integrated Design (RAPPID) project, was utilized as an initial approach to facilitate this team, set-based design. The conceptual design of a hatch-covered, <b>cellular,</b> feeder <b>container</b> ship was undertaken by a team of student design agents to assess the effectiveness of this design approach.

40|$|Malaria is {{an acute}} febrile illness caused by {{infection}} with parasitic protozoa {{of the genus}} Plasmodium, and is transmitted by the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. Severity and occurrence of malaria infection {{is dependent on the}} host and also many geographic and social factors. Currently, more than one third of the worlds population live in malaria endemic areas and approximately one billion people are estimated to carry the parasite at any one time. In Africa alone there are an estimated 200 - 450 million cases of fever in children infected with malaria parasites resulting in at least one million deaths each year. While erythrocytes have traditionally been regarded as relatively inert <b>cellular</b> <b>containers</b> of haemoglobin, in reality evidence suggests they in fact bear numerous surface molecules that are active in a variety of physiological processes. The varied roles of erythrocyte antigens include membrane structural integrity, transport of molecules through the membrane and as receptors for extracellular ligands. A number of molecules postulated {{to play a role in}} the malaria invasion process have already been identified on the erythrocyte surface such as the glycophorins. Certain red cell polymorphisms exhibit a protective effect against malaria infection and this has been suggested because of epidemiological evidence linking the distribution of these polymorphisms to areas currently or historically endemic for malaria. For example, individuals with the Duffy blood group negative phenotype are completely resistant to P. vivax infection and those who are Gerbich negative exhibit resistance to P. falciparum infection. The scope of this thesis was to investigate the role of red cell polymorphisms and malaria invasion into specific erythrocytes. Analysis of parasite invasion has revealed a complex yet highly ordered process involving proteins on the erythrocyte surface as receptors for parasite ligands. To date, several erythrocyte surface receptors have been identified such as the glycophorins however, the specific molecular interactions between merozoite surface ligands and erythrocyte receptors still remain elusive and not well understood. The aim of this thesis was to examine the involvement of the ABO blood group antigens and the Rhesus blood group antigens in P. falciparum invasion in vitro. The relationship between ABO blood groups and malaria has been extensively investigated with often contradictory results. Examination of gene frequencies of the ABO blood group systems in man indicates that they fluctuate markedly from place to place. There are likely to be subtle changes in gene frequencies that may reflect either a slight selective disadvantage or advantage to the host. One such change is the reductions of individuals with blood group A seen in African populations. These changes in gene frequency may indicate that the oligosaccharides of the immunodominant ABO blood group play a role in parasite invasion. This is consistent with previous studies which have shown that patients with blood group A exhibit a significantly greater risk of severe malaria. We present evidence that P. falciparum parasites exhibit enhanced invasion into A 1 erythrocytes when compared with invasion into A 2, B and O erythrocytes. Previous studies have suggested that P. falciparum merozoites have lectin like proteins on their surface that bind to erythrocyte carbohydrate receptors. Such observations suggest the presence of a parasite lectin on the merozoite. Our observation that parasites exhibit enhanced invasion into A 1 erythrocytes also suggests that the sugar residues of the immunodominant ABO blood group may have a role. This thesis aims to investigate a potential lectin binding protein which may be involved in the invasion process. This thesis also examines the role that null cells can play in the identification of previously undescribed receptors used by the malaria parasite. We investigate the role of the Rhesus blood group antigen by use of Rhesus null erythrocytes. Null erythrocytes provide a valuable tool for receptor identification. The findings presented in this chapter suggest that there is an alternative pathway that some P. falciparum parasites can utilise to invade the host erythrocyte. It appears that the use of the novel invasion receptor is selective, and it is utilised only when their primary receptors are absent or enzymatically removed on the Rhesus null erythrocyte. There are undoubtedly further complications in this story which are still to be elucidated, and it is likely that field isolates may manifest even greater variability than that found in the comparatively small number of laboratory isolates in which these pathways have been identified. Further investigation into the role of erythrocyte polymorphisms as receptors is warranted to elucidate the full repertoire of receptors that exist for parasite invasion. It is envisaged that by investigating erythrocyte proteins that this will provide invaluable information in regards to the invasion mechanism of P. falciparum parasites. Such insights are likely to open and close many avenues of research and assist in the development of a sound and rational basis for the identification of vaccines and drug targets...|$|R

After the war the Grace line operated 23 ships totaling 188,000 gross tons, and an additional 14 more on bareboat charters. In 1954 the company bought Davison Chemical Company (founded by William T. Davison as Davison, Kettlewell & Company in 1832), and the Dewey & Almy Chemical Company (founded in 1919 by Bradley Dewey and Charles Almy). In 1960 Grace Line, inspired by the pioneering efforts of Sea-Land Service, Matson Navigation, and Seatrain Lines, sought to begin containerizing its South American cargo operations by converting the conventional freighters Santa Eliana and Santa Leonor into fully <b>cellular</b> <b>container</b> ships. However, the effort was stymied by the opposition of longshoremen in New York and Venezuela and the ships were repeatedly laid up idle and were ultimately sold to the domestic container line Sea-Land Service in 1964. In 1963 Grace made a second attempt to containerize its South American trade when it ordered the four M-class combination passenger-cargo ships Santa Magdalaena, Santa Maria, Santa Mariana and Santa Mercedes with partial cellular holds, but they were no more successful as mixing conventional break-bulk cargo and containers in the same ship negated the operating economies that full containerization promised.|$|E
5000|$|Keith Walton Tantlinger (March 22, 1919 - August 27, 2011) was a {{mechanical}} engineer and inventor. As Vice President of Engineering at the Fruehauf Trailer Corporation his inventions {{played a major role}} in containerization. [...] Working with a Fruehauf customer, Malcom McLean, they spearheaded the container ship revolution in the 1950s, Tantlinger developed much of the early technology that made modern container shipping possible while at Fruehauf. After its initial order of containers from Brown Trailer, Sea-Land switched to containers made by the Strick division of the Fruehauf Trailer Company. Fruehauf had been one of the dominant players in building truck bodies and trailers for a long time, and, as already described, had previously innovated in the design and construction of the early commercial semi-trailers. President Roy Fruehauf was impressed with the idea of containerization, so in addition to manufacturing containers for Sea-Land his company agreed to make the trailer chassis that were needed, and also to provide financing to Sea-Land for the purchase of these containers and chassis. In 1958 Tantlinger left Sea-Land and became chief engineer at Fruehauf, where he continued to work with containers. More importantly, over the years he played a key role in the process of container standardization, working extensively on a committee of the American Standards Association (ASA) and later being critically involved with the ISO’s efforts. His designs included the corner casting and Twistlock systems found on every intermodal container, the spreader bar for automatic securing of containers lifted on and off ships, and the ship-shore container transfer apparatus for the first <b>cellular</b> <b>container</b> ship. In the course of his professional career, Tantlinger was granted 79 United States patents, all related to transportation equipment. Many of his patents related to commercial highway freight trailers and transit buses.|$|E
40|$|Continued {{growth of}} global {{containerisation}} {{led to the}} deployment of larger <b>cellular</b> <b>container</b> vessels. Many industry forecasters suggest {{the next generation of}} mega-size container ships will be 12, 000 to 16, 000 + TEU. These massive ships (about twice the capacity of today's largest container ships) will serve {{only a limited number of}} deep water or off-shore transshipment hub ports. There are four Canadian deep-water ports that could be considered for on-shore hub port development: Vancouver and Prince Rupert on the west coast, and Halifax and Canso on the east coast. Developing these major hub ports to serve North America's primary container trade are projects of national and international scope. Achieving this vision requires dedicated national and regional task forces to ensure infrastructure is in place, funding available, and legislative constraints eliminated.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the container revolutionised maritime trade and shipping. Since 1956 container vessels have evolved from converted tankers and cargo ships, via full <b>cellular</b> <b>container</b> ships that could navigate the Panama Canal, to post-Panamax vessels with a capacity of approx. 8500 TEU (Twenty foot Equivalent Unit). Even bigger container ships (9600 TEU) are to be delivered soon. However, current technical and physical constraints such as propulsion and port limitations pose restrictions to further growth. Moreover, the diminishing economies of scale in ship costs are offset by the increase of other costs involved (e. g. port fees, terminal handling charges). Nevertheless, empirical {{research shows that the}} concept of mega container vessels is appealing and that, if available, most shipping lines will deploy such ships. So, the next generation container ships will probably consist of Suez-max vessels (up to 12, 500 TEU) with twin propulsion systems. Albeit feasible from a technical point of view the ultimate 18, 000 TEU container ship i. e. Mallaca-max has too many limitations to become popular...|$|E
