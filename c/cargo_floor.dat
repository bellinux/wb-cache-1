25|$|Twin-engined {{military}} transport aircraft, {{powered by}} two 2,000 hp (1,419kW) Pratt & Whitney R-2800-51 radial piston engines, {{fitted with a}} large cargo door {{on the port side}} of the fuselage, equipped with strengthened <b>cargo</b> <b>floor,</b> a hydraulic winch and folding seats for up to 40 troops.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} difference between the Fit and the Insight platform is the position of the fuel tank. While the Fit locates the fuel tank under the front seats, the Insight positions the fuel tank under the rear seats. This allows the Insight’s hybrid battery pack to be located in the <b>cargo</b> <b>floor</b> below the spare tire, to accommodate folding rear seats, lower roofline, and a more aerodynamic body shape.|$|E
25|$|A two-door {{station wagon}} {{was added to}} the line in 1959. With the larger Rambler Six wagons offered only as four-door models, AMC's {{management}} thought there would be little sales cannibalization from the American. The Deluxe wagon was priced at $2,060, while the $2,145 Super version included a standard cargo-area mat and roof rack. A Deliveryman commercial wagon, with no rear seat and an extended <b>cargo</b> <b>floor,</b> was available, but found few takers. Self-adjusting brakes were added in 1959.|$|E
50|$|Besides the {{applications}} on the Airbus A380 fuselage, GLARE has multiple 'secondary' applications. GLARE {{is also the}} material used in the ECOS3 blast-resistant Unit Load Device. This is freight container shown to completely contain the explosion and fire resulting from a bomb such as that used over Lockerbie. Other applications include among others the application in the Learjet 45 {{and in the past}} also in <b>cargo</b> <b>floors</b> of the Boeing 737.|$|R
5000|$|The C-121 was the {{military}} transport version of improved L-749 introduced in 1948. Reinforced <b>floor,</b> <b>cargo</b> door in port rear fuselage ...|$|R
50|$|Both Mini Guppies {{were built}} using parts {{salvaged}} from a surplus Boeing 377, {{but with an}} all-new fuselage. This enabled Aero Spacelines to widen the Mini Guppy <b>cargo</b> bay <b>floor</b> to 13 ft (4 m), {{as opposed to the}} 8 ft (2.4 m) restriction imposed when building directly onto a B-377 fuselage. Borrowed parts included the cockpit, wings, and tail.|$|R
25|$|In April 1975, the Van {{received}} a higher roof {{and became a}} four-seater. This was necessitated by Japanese commercial vehicle regulation which require the floor to be completely flat when the rear seat is folded. Because the Rex's engine was mounted in the rear, the <b>cargo</b> <b>floor</b> was rather high, meaning that more head room would be required before a seat could be installed. The Wagon continued in production until the SEEC-T version was introduced in December, but it lost most of its market with {{the availability of a}} four-seater Van.|$|E
25|$|Toyota in Japan {{originally}} {{released the}} Scepter as {{a station wagon}} imported from the United States in September 1992. Japanese manufacture of the sedan occurred soon after, coming to the market in November 1992. From November 1993, Toyota began importing the coupe model from the United States. Scepters were phased out in 1996, starting with the coupe (April), wagon (June), and sedan (December). The large and spacious wagon, when fitted with third row seating that stowed away under the <b>cargo</b> <b>floor</b> could accommodate seven passengers. All three body variants were available with either the 2.2- and 3.0-liter engines.|$|E
25|$|The Insight’s IMA {{is powered}} by a flat, nickel metal hydride battery pack located below the <b>cargo</b> <b>floor</b> between the rear wheels. The 84 module battery is {{manufactured}} by Sanyo Electric and provides a nominal system voltage of 100.8 volts with a nominal capacity of 5.75 ampere-hours. The power density of the modules is 30 percent greater than in the second generation Civic Hybrid. The battery is recharged automatically by scavenging engine power, when needed, and by regenerative braking when the car is decelerating. The power management electronics, battery modules, and cooling system are all self-contained within the IMA battery pack.|$|E
50|$|Triumph Composite Systems in Spokane, Washington {{manufactures}} composite interior components {{ranging from}} <b>cargo</b> and commercial <b>floor</b> panels to environmental control system (ECS) ducting. The organization also produces dripshields, glareshields, aisle stands, side-wall risers and mix bay manifolds.|$|R
5000|$|Pan Am Flight 73, a 747-100, {{departed}} {{the runway}} on landing at Karachi International on August 4, 1983. The nose gear struck a VASI light installation and its concrete base causing the nose gear to collapse backwards {{and to the}} left, resulting in total destruction of the VASI light installation and damage to the forward <b>cargo</b> hold, <b>floor</b> of the first class section and the stairway leading to the upper deck. Damage to the aircraft was substantial. (Not {{to be confused with}} a later hijacking in 1986 of a Pan Am Flight 73).|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, the Element won the Dogcars.com [...] "Dog Car of the Year" [...] award {{because of}} its [...] "versatile <b>cargo</b> space, easy-clean <b>flooring,</b> crate-friendly rear design and {{optional}} all-wheel drive." [...] and in 2010 it won the [...] "Small SUV" [...] category as a [...] "Top Safety Pick" [...] in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Annual Awards.|$|R
2500|$|For cargo {{operations}} the C-17 requires {{a crew of}} three: pilot, copilot, and loadmaster. The cargo compartment is [...] long by [...] wide by [...] high. The <b>cargo</b> <b>floor</b> has rollers for palletized cargo {{but it can be}} flipped to provide a flat floor suitable for vehicles and other rolling stock. Cargo is loaded through a large aft ramp that accommodates rolling stock, such as a 69-ton (63-metric ton) M1 Abrams main battle tank, other armored vehicles, trucks, and trailers, along with palletized cargo.|$|E
2500|$|Van Zyl {{discovered}} that the front-right pallet was the [...] "seat" [...] of the fire. The manifest said that pallet mostly comprised computers in polystyrene packaging. The investigators said that the localised fire likely {{came in contact with}} the packaging and produced gases that accumulated near the ceiling. They also said that gases ignited into a flash fire that affected the entire cargo hold. The cargo fire of Flight 295 did not burn lower than one metre above the <b>cargo</b> <b>floor.</b> The walls and ceiling of the cargo hold received severe fire damage. Van Zyl ended his investigation without discovering why the fire started.|$|E
2500|$|For {{increased}} cargo capacity, {{a station}} wagon body style was offered from 1977. The wagon version was only five inches longer (127mm) and weighed only [...] more than the coupe. It was also a less unusual-looking design with a squared-off back and straight, almost upright, rear side windows. Although front vent windows were optional on all Pacers, the wagon's rear side glass featured vent windows as standard. [...] The broad and rear liftgate opened to a wide, flat cargo area with [...] of space, significantly easing the task of loading cargo. The rear seat also folded flat to form {{a continuation of the}} <b>cargo</b> <b>floor.</b> Some wagon models featured simulated woodgrain trim on the lower body sides and the liftgate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{military}} transport version, {{often called}} the Yak-16-II, differed from the passenger version as it carried a UTK-1 ball turret that mounted a [...] Berezin UBT machine gun immediately behind the flight deck, the <b>cargo</b> cabin <b>floor</b> was reinforced, the vertical tail was slightly larger and the fuselage was slightly longer. It used three-bladed V-511 feathering propellers with scimitar-shaped blades. It could carry seven paratroopers, ten fully equipped troops or six stretcher cases and a medical attendant. It was fitted with a large clamshell door {{on the left side}} of the fuselage to facilitate cargo loading. This door had a smaller, inward-opening door set into its forward half. Three TsDMMM-120 supply containers could be fitted on racks underneath the wing center section and it was fitted with a glider tow hook.|$|R
50|$|The Cessna 404 was a {{development}} of the Cessna 402 with an enlarged vertical tail and other changes. The prototype first flew on 26 February 1975. It is powered by two 375 hp/280 kW turbocharged Continental Motors GTSIO-520 piston engines. Two versions were offered originally; the Titan Ambassador passenger aircraft for ten passengers, and the Titan Courier utility aircraft for passengers or cargo. By early 1982 seven different variants were available, including a pure cargo version, the Titan Freighter. The Freighter was fitted with a strengthened <b>floor,</b> <b>cargo</b> doors, and its interior walls and ceiling were made from impact-resistant polycarbonate materials to minimize damage {{in the event of}} cargo breaking free in-flight.|$|R
2500|$|On 12 February 2007, Boeing {{announced}} it was offering the KC-767 Advanced Tanker for the KC-X Tanker competition. Boeing stated that for KC-X's requirements, the KC-767 was a better fit than the KC-777. On 11 April 2007, Boeing submitted its KC-767 tanker proposal to U.S. Air Force. The KC-767 Advanced Tanker offered for this KC-X round {{was based on the}} in-development 767-200LRF (Long Range Freighter), rather than the -200ER on which Italian and Japanese KC-767 aircraft are based differing by combining the -200ER fuselage, -300F wing, gear, <b>cargo</b> door and <b>floor,</b> -400ER digital flightdeck and flaps, uprated engines, and [...] "sixth-generation" [...] fly-by-wire fuel delivery boom. The KC-767 uses manual flight control, allowing unrestricted maneuverability to avoid threats anywhere in the flight envelope.|$|R
2500|$|Beginning in 1965, Project Black Spot was a {{test program}} {{designed}} to give the Air Force a self-contained night attack capability to seek out and destroy targets along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. After the program {{was approved by the}} Department of Defense in early 1966, E-Systems of Greenville, Texas modified two C-123K Providers which were redesignated NC-123Ks, but were often referred to as AC-123Ks. The aircraft were equipped with a long, 57.75inch nose fairing that housed an X-band forward-looking radar. Below and aft of the extended radome was a turret with Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR), Low-Level Light Television (LLLTV), and a laser range-finder/illuminator. Also, a low-level Doppler navigation radar and weapons release computer were installed. Two rectangular aluminum weapons dispensers (for CBU bomblets) were stacked within the fuselage. Each container housed 12 cells, each cell containing three Cluster Bomb Units (CBUs). Depending on the type of CBU installed, the containers had a capacity of between 2,664 and 6,372 one pound bomblets. The bomblets were released through 12 openings in the <b>cargo</b> <b>floor</b> that aligned with the cells in the weapons dispenser. The lower fuselage contained 12 inward opening doors that aligned with the openings in the <b>cargo</b> <b>floor,</b> forming a chute. Bomblet release was controlled by a weapons panel in the forward section of the fuselage. In the event of an emergency, the entire load could be jettisoned manually. The first aircraft, 54–691, was delivered to Eglin AFB in August 1967 and the second, 54–698, incorporating an AN/ASD-5 Black Crow direction finder set (engine ignition sensor), was delivered in February 1968. The two aircraft were then deployed, first the Republic of Korea, to be evaluated against North Korean high-speed patrol boats used to insert agents, 19 August – 23 October 1968; and then to South Vietnam with operations beginning 15 November 1968. Despite their success, with 70% of all missions completed and in-commission rate of 84%, there were no follow-on NC-123Ks modified. [...] The two aircraft were transferred to the 16th Special Operations Squadron at Udon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, where they continued to serve from late 1969 to June 1970. Both airframes were then returned to standard C-123K configuration to serve again as airlifters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Insight had {{a conventional}} manual transmission. Starting with the 2001 model, a CVT {{variant of the}} Insight was available; the CVT {{is similar to that}} used in the Honda Civic Hybrid and the Honda Logo. A traditional transmission shifts between a fixed set of engine-to-wheel ratios; however, a CVT allows for an infinite set of ratios between its lowest gear and its highest. A feature shared by the two hybrids (and now appearing in others) is the ability to automatically turn off the engine when the vehicle is at a stop (and restart it upon movement). Since it is more powerful than most starters of conventional cars, the Insight's electric motor can start the engine nearly instantaneously. The Integrated Motor Assist is run by an [...] "Intelligent Power Unit (IPU)", a desktop computer-sized box. The Intelligent Power Unit, the Power control Unit, the Electronic Control Unit, the vehicle's batteries, dc-to-dc converter and a high-voltage inverter are all located under the <b>cargo</b> <b>floor</b> of the vehicle, behind the seats.|$|E
2500|$|A station wagon, {{marketed as}} the Lakewood joined the lineup in 1961 with its engine located under the <b>cargo</b> <b>floor</b> and {{offering}} 68ft³ (1.9m³) of cargo room; 58ft³ {{in the main}} passenger compartment, and another 10ft³ in the front trunk. The Corvair engine received its first size increase to [...] via {{a slight increase in}} bore size and was rated at [...] The base engine was still rated at [...] when paired with the manual transmissions and [...] when mated to the optional automatic transmission in Monza models. To increase luggage capacity in the front trunk, the spare tire was relocated to the engine compartment (in cars without air-conditioning) and new [...] "direct air" [...] heater directed warmed air from the cylinders and heads to the passenger compartment. The gasoline heater remained available as an option through 1963. Factory air conditioning was offered as a mid-1961 option introduction. The condenser lay flat atop the horizontal engine fan. A large, green-painted reverse rotation version of the standard GM Frigidaire air conditioning compressor was used, and an evaporator housing was added under the dash with integrated outlets surrounding the radio housing. Air conditioning was not available on wagons, Greenbrier/Corvair 95, or the turbocharged models introduced later, due to space constraints.|$|E
50|$|To meet {{military}} requirements {{the first}} production aircraft had four additional auxiliary fuel tanks {{in the main}} cabin which reduced the passenger seats to 26. The following batch of aircraft were designated C-54A and were built with a stronger <b>floor,</b> <b>cargo</b> door with a hoist and winch. The first C-54A was delivered in February 1943. With {{the introduction of the}} C-54B in March 1944 the outer wings were changed to hold integral fuel tanks allowing two of the cabin tanks to be removed, this allowed 49-seats (or 16 stretchers) to be fitted. The C-54C was a hybrid for Presidential use, it had a C-54A fuselage with four cabin fuel tanks and the C-54B wings with built in tanks to achieve maximum range.|$|R

2500|$|The 4.4kWh {{lithium-ion}} battery {{developed for the}} Prius Plug-in fits under the rear <b>cargo</b> <b>floor</b> and weighs [...] As a comparison, the nickel-metal hydride battery of the third generation Prius, which has a capacity of only 1.3kWh, weighs [...] A full charge using an external AC outlet takes approximately 2.5 to 3.0 hours from a standard North American 120V 15A household outlet, or 1.5 hours using a standard European 230V household outlet. [...] The battery requires approximately 3.2 kWh of electricity plus [...] of gasoline to provide [...] of range. [...] A fully charged {{battery state of charge}} reads 85% and the all-electric mode disengages at 23%, and the usable energy after charging loss is 2.73 kWh. The included charging cable connects to the charging port inlet located on the right-rear fender. The charge port location was moved from the front driver-side fender in the demonstration model based on input from the program participants. The battery charger cable weighs just , is [...] in length, and fits in its own compartment in the trunk area. [...] The charge port provides LED (Light Emitting Diode) illumination for convenient night-time charging. [...] A timer allows charging to take place during off-peak hours and can be set for either a start or end time.|$|E
2500|$|From 1971 to 1976, Buick's {{full-sized}} Estate Wagon {{shared the}} [...] wheelbase and 455 cubic-inch V8 with the Electra 225, and shared its {{interior and exterior}} styling from 1971 to 1974 (complete with the prerequisite four VentiPorts). And although from 1975 to 1976 the number of VentiPorts were reduced by one, and the front fascia was downgraded to a LeSabre's, the Electra 225 style chrome rocker panel moldings and distinctive Electra 225 style rear quarter panels (albeit without fender skirts) remained. These were the first Buick station wagons to be built on Buick's largest chassis since the Roadmaster Estates of 1947–53. The Estate Wagons, as did other GM full-sized wagons during these years, used a unique rear suspension with multi-leaf springs instead of the coil springs used on other full-sized Buicks, and other full-sized GM cars. The Estate Wagons also featured a new 'clamshell' tailgate design where the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof as the tailgate (manually or with power assist), slid into a recess under the <b>cargo</b> <b>floor.</b> The power tailgate, the first in station wagon history, ultimately supplanted the manual tailgate, which required marked effort to lift from storage. It was operated by switches on the instrument panel or a key switch on the rear quarter panel. The clamshell system, heavy and complex, {{made it easier to}} load and unload the extremely long wagons in tight spaces. But it remained un-adopted by any other manufacturer, and would be eliminated when GM reduced the length of their wagons by about a foot in 1977, and the overriding concern became increased fuel economy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cargo</b> <b>floor</b> contour: Favoring cargo capacity, {{a station}} wagon may {{prioritize}} a fold-flat floor, where a hatchback would more likely allow a <b>cargo</b> <b>floor</b> with pronounced contour (e.g. the new Mini or the sixth generation Ford Fiesta).|$|E
50|$|The Toyota bB was not {{equipped}} with a spare tire. On the Scion xB, a compact spare tire was stored under {{the left side of}} a raised rear <b>cargo</b> <b>floor.</b> Since the spare tire raised the <b>cargo</b> <b>floor</b> by several inches, a storage bin was added {{to the right of the}} spare tire to reclaim some of the lost storage space. A jack was stored under the driver's seat of the xB.|$|E
50|$|Debuting for 2004 {{was a new}} coil-spring rear {{suspension}} for the solid rear axle. A Watt's linkage system is fitted to the rear axle, centering the axle and reducing rear-end skate over rough surfaces, and allowing a lower and wider <b>cargo</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Twin-engined {{military}} transport aircraft, {{powered by}} two 2,000 hp (1,419 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-2800-51 radial piston engines, {{fitted with a}} large cargo door {{on the port side}} of the fuselage, equipped with strengthened <b>cargo</b> <b>floor,</b> a hydraulic winch and folding seats for up to 40 troops.|$|E
5000|$|Troop {{transport}} {{version of}} the C-47 that lacked the reinforced <b>cargo</b> <b>floor,</b> large cargo door, and hoist attachment of the C-47 Skytrain. It was dedicated for the troop transport role and could carry 28 passengers in fixed metal seats arranged in rows in the former cargo space; 221 built.|$|E
50|$|Two years later, Volkswagen again {{increased}} the gross vehicle weight, with the 5.6 ton LT 55. It was available with a single-tyre rear axle, allowing for more space between {{rear wheel wells}} inside the <b>cargo</b> <b>floor.</b> An LT with four-wheel drive that could be enabled from within the cab was also available.|$|E
50|$|He {{also worked}} on {{friction}} stir welding of prototype <b>cargo</b> <b>floor</b> assemblies of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules military transport aircraft and the qualification of these structures. In collaboration with the Air Force Research Laboratory and the University of South Carolina designed and fabricated an aircraft wing-box assembly for the Joint Strike Fighter by additive manufacturing using {{friction stir welding}}.|$|E
50|$|Based on the estate, a 5-door Van was {{introduced}} in 1984. Unlike similar car derived vans, the Sierra Van retained its side windows were replacing them with steel panels was more common. The backseat was removed and the metal <b>cargo</b> <b>floor</b> was extended towards the front seats. A diesel engine and a limited choice of petrol engines were available for the Van. This variant was never sold in the UK.|$|E
50|$|The most {{significant}} difference between the Fit and the Insight platform is the position of the fuel tank. While the Fit locates the fuel tank under the front seats, the Insight positions the fuel tank under the rear seats. This allows the Insight’s hybrid battery pack to be located in the <b>cargo</b> <b>floor</b> below the spare tire, to accommodate folding rear seats, lower roofline, and a more aerodynamic body shape.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} (entry) trim level, typically {{marketed as}} Pop, includes power windows and door locks, Uconnect 5.0 system with 5-inch touchscreen interface, handsfree calling, Bluetooth-streaming audio, voice-controllable radio; hill start assist; and a reconfigurable interior design marketed as Magic Cargo Space {{which includes a}} three-level rear <b>cargo</b> <b>floor</b> panel, fold-flat front passenger seat as well as for-aft sliding, fold and tumble, reclining rear seating. The standard trim level typically offers no option packages.|$|E
50|$|There is no doorjamb {{between the}} front and rear doors that the doors attach to on the {{passenger}} side, and the passenger front seat folds flat upon itself and then can be folded forward while still being attached to the floor at the front bottom of the seat. The rear seats can be folded flat with a 60:40 split or can also be folded forward individually for a rear flat <b>cargo</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
