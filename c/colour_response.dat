40|$|Abstract The most {{commonly}} used method for the measurement {{of the level of}} endo-xylanase in commercial enzyme preparations is the 3, 5 -dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) reducing sugar method with birchwood xylan as substrate. It is well known that with the DNS method, much higher enzyme activity values are obtained than with the Nelson-Somogyi (NS) reducing sugar method. In this paper, we have compared the DNS and NS reducing sugar assays using a range of xylan-type substrates and accurately compared the molar response factors for xylose and a range of xylo-oligosaccharides. Purified beechwood xylan or wheat arabinoxylan is shown to be a suitable replacement for birchwood xylan which is no longer commercially available, and it is clearly demonstrated that the DNS method grossly overestimates endo-xylanase activity. Unlike the DNS assay, the NS assay gave the equivalent <b>colour</b> <b>response</b> with equimolar amounts of xylose, xylobiose, xylotriose and xylotetraose demonstrating that it accurately measures the quantity of glycosidic bonds cleaved by the endo-xylanase.

The last decade has seen such approaches being extended to recreational drug use. Most harm reduction initiatives have aimed to inform users about risks and ways of minimizing risk. The concept of providing illicit drug users with quality assessment of their chosen drug is one possible harm reduction intervention that until recently has received little attention. In response to well-publicized ‘ecstasy’-related deaths organizations in some European countries and the United States have chosen to provide a ‘pill testing service ’ for users. There are two broad categories of pill testing offered. Simple colour reagent test kits (Marquis Reagent and colour charts) form the most widely used on-site pill testing method. Less frequently, but more accurately, laboratory personnel with access to sophisticated chromatographic equipment (high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS)) may provide analysis of a pill. Pill testing kits have been advocated as a ‘tool to protect yourself against the polluted XTC market’. We refute this line of reasoning. Of the different tests only techniques such as GC-MS can identify satisfactorily the psychoactive constituents present in ecstasy pills. Colour tests based on an interpretation of a <b>colour</b> <b>response</b> {{in the presence of a}} drug are, at best, subjective.

40|$|The {{research}} work {{described in this}} thesis embodies {{a number of studies}} designed to investigate human vision with emphasis on aspects of the pupil response and chromatic mechanisms in relation to the perceived chromatic afterimages. The aim of the first study was to establish the relationship between the perception of chromatic afterimages and the corresponding involuntary pupil responses. We started by designing and developing a new, computer-based, psychophysics program and employed it to measure the strength and duration of perceived chromatic afterimages in normal trichromats and in colour deficient observers. The dynamic luminance noise technique was used to isolate colour signals and to elicit pupil responses to coloured stimuli of known photoreceptor contrast. A model was developed to explain the afterimage results obtained in the normal trichromats and in colour deficient subjects. The model and the pupil <b>colour</b> <b>responses</b> provided an understanding of luminance and colour processing in dichromats that also helped to explain previously reported pupil <b>colour</b> <b>responses.</b> The model also predicts the colour confusion lines and the characteristics of pupil <b>colour</b> <b>responses</b> in dichromats at any given background chromaticity. In the second study, we investigated and compared pupil responses to visual stimuli that isolate photopic luminance and colour in both the sighted and blind region of the visual fields on subjects with either acquired or congenital homonymous hemianopia. The measured pupil responses in the blind hemifield of patients with acquired cortical damage are either absent or of reduced amplitude when compared to those measured in the corresponding regions of the sighted field, whereas the patients with congenital loss of visual field show similar and even enhanced pupil responses when compared to their sighted hemifield. These results suggest that in the absence of normal functioning of the direct geniculostriate projection, other projections to midbrain nuclei or to extrastriate regions can be enhanced and these include the pupillary pathways. These findings suggest that early damage to the brain might be partly compensated for by reorganising the strength of neural projections to the remaining, non-compromised visual areas. The purpose of the last study was to examine whether melanopsin contributes to the dynamic pupil light reflex responses in humans. A light source containing of four primary components was employed to generate pupillary stimuli that isolate luminance, colour or combined rod and melanopsin. Normal trichormats, rod deficient subjects, one subject with retinitis pigmentosa, one rod monochromat, three subjects with Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) and one subject with Optic Neuritis were investigated using this approach. The results from the LHON subjects suggest not all classes of ganglion cells are affected uniformly in LHON, and that the pupil light reflex responses mediated through rod photoreceptors were affected the least. The characteristics of the pupil responses to the rod/melanopsin stimulus from the rod monochromat and the retinis pigmentosa subjects suggest that melanopsin does not contribute to dynamic pupil light reflex response in humans...|$|R

Knowledge about the colour rendering from wood that is subjected to heat under humid conditions and/or artificial drying, especially kiln drying, is thus of interest. It is also of interest to understand the chemical background, for the colouring process, for future development of treatment and drying. The stability of the colour of wood exposed to UV/visible-light is also of concern when considering qualitative wood products. The <b>colour</b> <b>response</b> of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea Abies) and birch (Betula pubescens) was studied when exposed to heat and humid air, either as a hydrothermal treatment, where the wood contained capillary (free) water for certain times and temperatures, or a laboratory kiln drying. The wood subjected to hydrothermal treatment was also exposed to UV/visible-light to study the colour stability. The chemical background for the colour change during hydrothermal treatment was briefly investigated by using extraction, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and UV/Visible-spectroscopy. The results show that multivariate modelling (PLS) of industrial wood-colour is possible as average values for the whole batch, "batch-colour". Quite strong colour changes (DE*ab > 10) were formed using hydrothermal treatment at 80 - 95 ºC for 3 - 6 days. Furthermore, this quite strong colour formed is similarly stable when exposed to UV/Visible-light for 100 hours as untreated wood.

They offer several benefits over current diagnostic systems, including rapid diagnostic results in comparison to microbial cultures, simple interpretation of results, portability, and requiring no specialised laboratory equipment or technical training to operate. These are essential for diagnosing critical illnesses, such as sepsis, in areas of poor healthcare infrastructure. Sepsis, an innate physiological response to infection, is a growing problem worldwide with high associated costs and mortality rates, and affects a wide range of patients including neonates, infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. A literature review of the biomarkers of sepsis and the currently available diagnostic systems indicates the need for a biosensor capable of meeting the requirements of designing POCT systems and achieving detection of low concentrations of biomarkers. To meet these demands, two significant contributions to developing POCT platforms have been achieved and described in this thesis, including: 1) development of a colorimetric, magnetically separable biosensor that can be easily fabricated and demonstrates an easily identifiable <b>colour</b> <b>response</b> upon analyte detection, as well as the ability to capture and detection target biomarkers at low concentrations from complex solutions; and 2) tuning of the biosensor’s colorimetric response to achieve low detection limits, as well as demonstration of the versatility of the biosensor for sensing different target analytes.

Therefore, the need for detection and inhibition of such bacterial colonisation requires a methodology for sensing/killing pathogenic bacteria. This research project aims to design a ‗smart‘ wound dressing system which can respond to the microbiological environment of the wound via a simple colour change and will release antimicrobials only when required. Two strains of pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA 476) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO 1) {{were used in the}} study. The non-pathogenic bacterium E. coli (DH 5 α) was used as a control organism as it does not secrete virulence factors and therefore does not lyse membranes of vesicles. The key contributions of this thesis are outlined below. Firstly, an initial responsive nanocapsule system was studied. The fundamental work with giant unilamellar vesicles proved such a responsive system can provide antimicrobial properties when antimicrobial agents were encapsulated within the vesicles. Secondly, partially polymerised vesicles—polydiacetylene/phospholipid vesicles were then developed to improve vesicle stability. The vesicle system was optimised by varying molar concentration of diacetylene monomers (TCDA) in order to obtain relatively stable vesicles as well as sensitivity to the toxins secreted by the pathogenic strains. Measurements proved that the polydiacetylene/phospholipid vesicles can respond to pathogenic bacteria when fluorescent dye/antimcirobials were encapsulated in the vesicles. Finally, a simple prototype dressing was constructed. Plasma polymerised maleic anhydride (pp-MA) deposited onto non-woven polypropylene was shown to be a good method to stabilise vesicles via covalent bonding. Vesicle adhered to pp-MA non-woven polypropylene showed the ability to inhibit/kill the pathogenic strains, quantified by the Japanese Industry Standard assay and also gave a fluorimetric <b>colour</b> <b>response</b> in the presence of pathogenic bacteria when a fluorescent dye is encapsulated within vesicles.

This thesis is about enhancing quality in stoneware glazes and pigments studying the effect of secondary fluxes fired in a reduction atmosphere. Emphasis is placed on establishing an accurate analysis of locally obtainable materials, which cumulatively form the main materials database utilized in this research, necessary in investigating the advantages of using actual analysis as opposed to theoretical analysis when performing glaze calculations. In order to carry out the numerous calculations associated with this research {{it is clear that the}} most logical way to do this was through the use of computer applications. This leads to the investigation of established software programs used for glaze calculation. Two main programs Insight™ (1986) and HyperGiaze™ (1988) have been reviewed, determining whether computer software glaze calculation programs assist in producing glazes which have a better fit, surface quality, and brightness of colour. Subsequently a glaze calculation program GLAZECALC has been written using a spreading sheet application incorporating the local materials database. This research has focused on traditional based stoneware glazes derivative of those originally used in the Song dynasty - 'Celadons and Chuns' and the Ming dynasty - 'Copper Reds', examining "flux substitution" as a means of enhancing the brightness of these glazes. It is noted that the incorporation of additional fluxes into a recipe as a colour enhancer, also has the effect in some cases of improving the surface quality of a glaze. As a consequence, considerable investigations have gone into researching Coefficient of Thermal Expansion, looking at a dual role in the substitution of fluxes i. e. colour enhancement and improved body fit.

40|$|The {{chromatic}} {{physiology of}} the stoneloach (Noemacheilus barbatulus L.) was investigated by recording the melanophore index and the transmembrane potential of melanophores using split fin and chromatically intact spinal preparations. Responses of fish to {{black and white}} backgrounds, background reversal and darkness show that the transient <b>colour</b> <b>response</b> of this fish is similar to other freshwater teleosts. Adrenergic neurons produce aggregation. Cholinergic neurons appear to play no part in granule movement, although atropine produces dispersion in split fin preparations. Potassium ions produce aggregation which is blocked by yohimbine suggesting that this aggregation is mediated through adrenergic action. Calcium ions are important for both aggregation and dispersion, facilitating the release of aggregating transmitter and acting directly on the cell. The melanophore centrosphere depolarises in aggregating cells and hyperpolarises in dispersing ones. Changes in potential precede granule movement which is slower in dispersing melanophores. Measurement of the melanophore potential at the cell centrosphere and {{the edge of the}} pigment show that the cell processes are electrogenically polarised. Also, the sum of these potentials remains nearly constant although the potentials themselves vary with the position of the pigment. The transmembrane potential is related to the transmembrane potassium gradient, although it is also influenced by sodium and calcium ions. The potassium gradient varies locally depending on the reactions involved in maintaining the current pigment position resulting in electrogenic polarisation of the raelanophore. Energy is required for the maintenance of dispersion and membrane potential since ouabain produces aggregation and depolarisation. Low temperature inhibits aggregation and dispersion, although it has little effect on membrane potential. High temperature causes depolarisation probably by cell damage. Microtubules appear to play no part in the maintenance of the membrane potential. However, colchicine produces dispersion of the granules which suggests that inhibition of microtubules by colchicine is incomplete and/or other cytoplasmic elements are able to produce granule movement, or that colchicine has other effects on the cell. It is concluded that changes in the membrane potential and electrogenic polarisation of the cell give significant indications of the nervous and cellular mechanisms involved in the chromatic physiology of teleosts. <p...|$|E

The structural modifications of the pineal organ in normal and blind fish in conditions of constant light, temperature, darkness and different background tints are described. Constant illumination together with constant temperature in the blind fish result in a very much folded pineal organ. It is suggested that a non-functioning photoreceptive state of the eyes (condition present in these blind fish and the normal and blind fish kept in darkness at a higher temperature) {{is responsible for the}} stimulation of the pineal organ at a constant higher temperature. The antagonistic reaction to the pituitary in relation to the ovaries is also described. Changes following hypophysectomy also suggest an antagonistic relation between the pineal organ and the pituitary. The relations of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal system and its vascular supply are discussed with regard to the neurosecretory function of the nucleus preopticus and itspreoptico-hypophyseal tract and the transport and storage of the neurosecretory material. The developmental differentiation of the system is studied. Seasonal changes in the hypothalamo-hypophyseal neurosecretory system, especially the NPO-activity, are correlated with the reproductive cycle and their significance is discussed. An attempt is made to interpret the relation of the optic nerves with the preoptico-hypophyseal tract. The relation of the latter with the commissura transversa is described, especially with regard to the possible relaying of messages from the cerebellum to the pituitary gland.

Moreover, spiropyran functionalised micro-beads were incorporated into micro-fluidic flow systems, such as capillary separation columns. In addition, photochromic monolithic scaffolds were synthesised within polytetrafluoroethylene coated fused silica capillaries and used as stationary phases in micro-chips to function as photo-controllable electro-osmotic pumps. Novel multifunctional materials based on ionogels, consisting of a polymeric structure incorporating spiropyran units and phosphonium based ionic liquids, {{have been used as}} light-actuated valve structures in micro-fluidic platforms. Through variation of the composition of the ionogels, the micro-valves can be tuned to open at different times under similar illumination conditions. In parallel, the ionogels were soaked in ethanol and then transferred to water, where they moved spontaneously. This movement is driven by the expulsion of the ethanol from the gel and subsequent ethanol spreading at the air-water interface. We have investigated this solvent driven motion for as a driving force for moving small objects in aqueous media. We have also developed an innovative miniaturised system for continuous measurement of the pH of sample solutions and vapour streams during chemical or biological processes. It consists of a simple barcode sensor with several pH dyes doped in an ionogel matrix which is able to generate a characteristic fingerprint-type <b>colour</b> <b>response</b> within a single “snapshot” for different pH solutions and vapours. As the sensor is based on an ionogel polymer, it has extremely long stability, and the sensor dyes show no measureable leaching into aqueous sample solutions. Finally a wearable, robust, flexible and disposable micro-fluidic device which incorporates micro-Light Emitting Diodes (μ-LEDs) as a detection system, for real time monitoring of the pH of sweat generated during an exercise period has been fabricated and assessed. In our approach, the sensors are immobilised within ECG electrodes, as this allows the pH measurements to be gathered without changing the conventional form of ECG monitoring during exercise. This provides immediate feedback regarding sweat composition to an athlete and coach, which can be used to optimise the hydration and performance of the athlete...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} demand for low cost, portable CMOS image sensors because of increased integration, and new applications in the automotive, mobile communication and medical industries, amongst others. Colour reproduction remains imperfect in conventional digital image sensors, due to {{the limitations of the}} dye-based filters. Further improvement is required if the full potential of digital imaging is to be realised. In alternative systems, where accurate colour reproduction is a priority, existing equipment is too bulky for anything but specialist use. In this work both these issues are addressed by exploiting nanophotonic techniques to create enhanced trichromatic filters, and multispectral filters, all of which can be fabricated on-chip, i. e. integrated into a conventional digital image sensor, to create compact, low cost, mass produceable imaging systems with accurate colour reproduction. The trichromatic filters are based on plasmonic structures. They exploit the excitation of surface plasmon resonances in arrays of subwavelength holes in metal films to filter light. The currently-known analytical expressions are inadequate for optimising all relevant parameters of a plasmonic structure. In order to obtain arbitrary filter characteristics, an automated design procedure was developed that integrated a genetic algorithm and 3 D finite-difference time-domain tool. The optimisation procedure's efficacy is demonstrated by designing a set of plasmonic filters that replicate the CIE (1931) colour matching functions, which themselves mimic the human eye's daytime <b>colour</b> <b>response.</b> The best designs were fabricated and demonstrated a least-mean-square error, in comparison to the desired colour matching functions, of 6. 37 * 10 ^ 3, 2. 34 * 10 ^ 3 and 11. 10 * 10 ^ 3 for the red, green, and blue filters respectively. Notably the spectrum for the red filter contained a double peak, as present in the corresponding colour matching function. Such dual peak behaviour cannot be achieved using a single current dye-based filter. The filters retain the same layer thickness for all structures so they can be defined in a single lithography step. A new approach to enable the fabrication of a multispectral filter array on a CMOS imager is also presented. This combines a Fabry-Perot filter with effective medium theory (EMT) to enable the fabrication of multiple filters in a single cavity length via lithographic tuning of the filter passband. Two approaches are proposed; air-filled nanostructures and dielectric backfilled nanostructures. The air-filled approach is demonstrated experimentally producing three filters with FWHM of 60 - 64 nm. Using the backfilled design, and incorporating a highindex cavity material, a set of twenty three narrowband filters, with a FWHM of 22 - 46 nm is demonstrated. A virtual image reproduction process was developed to quantify the image reproduction performance of both the plasmonic and Fabry-Perot filter sets. A typical rgb dye-based filter set used in conventional imagers achieves a mean colour error of 2. 711, whereas the experimental data from the plasmonic filters achieves an error of 2. 222 which demonstrated a slight improvement in colour reproduction. The multispectral filter set developed in this work performed even better, with 4 filters giving an error of 0. 906, 10 filters an error of 0. 072 and continued improvement in the colour error reaching 0. 047 for 23 filters. All the filter sets proposed are fully compatible with the CMOS process so as to enable direct integration onto CMOS image sensors in industrial foundries in future. The performance of the presented filters also suggest new compact applications in art reproduction, agricultural monitoring and medical imaging...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} cobalt pyroxenes and it {{is mostly}} based on the join CaCoSi 2 O 6 -Co 2 Si 2 O 6. This series has an interest both in Mineralogy and Ceramic Science. If we consider Mineralogy {{it is interesting to}} stress the analogy with the rock forming quadrilateral pyroxenes formed by diopside - enstatite (CaMgSi 2 O 6 - Mg 2 Si 2 O 6) and hedenbergite - ferrosilite (CaFeSi 2 O 6 - Fe 2 Si 2 O 6) series. Moreover, Ca,Co-pyroxenes (CaCoSi 2 O 6 -Co 2 Si 2 O 6) provide a crystal chemical model to study the solid solutions of pyroxenes with a large ionic radius cation in the M 2 site, such as diopside (CaMgSi 2 O 6) and hedenbergite (CaFeSi 2 O 6) and those with a smaller cation, such as enstatite, (Mg 2 Si 2 O 6) and ferrosilite, (Fe 2 Si 2 O 6). Regarding Ceramic Sciences Ca,Co-pyroxenes may be used as a ceramic pigment, with good chemical stability and colour properties, whose stability field and physical properties are poorly constrained. This work is dived in three parts. In an introductory first part, the use of cobalt as an industrial inorganic pigment is reported. Cobalt is an important colour agent, giving different hues, obtained by the different coordination number of this element in the structure. If cobalt is in tetrahedral coordination the colour is deep blue (e. g. blue cobalt pigment, based on CoAl 2 O 4 spinel); otherwise, if the coordination number is higher, six or eight, the hue swings to pink (e. g. Co-olivine Co 2 SiO 4, Ca,Co-pyroxenes (Ca,Co) Si 2 O 6, or Co-garnet Co 3 Al 2 Si 3 O 12). The possible use of Ca,Co-pyroxenes as a pigment is then introduced; being Ca,Co-pyroxenes a member of the pyroxene mineral family, and in view of planning subsequent experiments, phase equilibria in the closely related group of quadrilateral pyroxenes, constituents of most rock forming pyroxenes, are presented. The presence of a miscibility gap between Ca-rich and Ca-poor pyroxenes, and the coexistence at low pressure of non-pyroxene phases are reported and discussed. The detailed crystal structure of pyroxenes has been then shown, for monoclinic and orthorhombic pyroxenes, in order to provide the basis for an interpretation of the Ca,Co-pyroxene properties at the atomic level. The different pyroxene varieties are related to the phase diagram stability conditions and crystal chemistry. In the second part, based on a ceramic approach, Co-pyroxenes are synthesized at room pressure, with particular attention to the end member or close to end member CoCaSi 2 O 6 : this composition is most promising for a possible use as pigment, being stable also at room pressure. The conditions at which the end member is stable as a single phase are sought, as the coexistence with other phases, mostly Co-ackermanite (Ca 2 CoSi 2 O 7) significantly modifies the <b>colour</b> <b>response</b> of the mixture, from pink in pure Ca,Co-pyroxene, to blue if some Co-ackermanite is present. The colorimetric properties of the mixtures obtained at room pressure for the starting materials along the CaCoSi 2 O 6 -Co 2 Si 2 O 6 series, are also determined at different temperature, relating the colour effect to the percentage of the phases. In the third part we use a mineralogical crystal chemical approach: a series of pyroxenes with compositions spanning along the CaCoSi 2 O 6 -Co 2 Si 2 O 6 join are synthesized at high pressure and characterized to understand the effect of Ca with Co substitution on the crystal-chemical and physical properties of pyroxenes. A pyroxene only phase-diagram is obtained: the observed miscibility gap and the phase transition between C 2 /c and P 21 /c pyroxenes are compared with those of quadrilateral pyroxenes and related to the structural changes obtained by single crystal investigation. The results constrain the chemical properties of pyroxenes, discussing the general point of the substitution of a smaller cation vs a larger one in pyroxenes in view of a simple ionic model. The crystal structure, the symmetry variations, the phase diagram, and the physical properties of the Co-pyroxenes are analyzed by means of a multi-technique approach, using X-Ray Diffraction (powder and single crystal), Transmission and Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive System analysis and Raman micro-spectroscopy...|$|E
25|$|Most fish, {{reptiles}} and amphibians {{undergo a}} limited physiological <b>colour</b> change in <b>response</b> {{to a change in}} environment. This type of camouflage, known as background adaptation, most commonly appears as a slight darkening or lightening of skin tone to approximately mimic the hue of the immediate environment. It has been demonstrated that the background adaptation process is vision-dependent (it appears the animal {{needs to be able to}} see the environment to adapt to it), and that melanin translocation in melanophores is the major factor in colour change. Some animals, such as chameleons and anoles, have a highly developed background adaptation response capable of generating a number of different colours very rapidly. They have adapted the capability to change <b>colour</b> in <b>response</b> to temperature, mood, stress levels, and social cues, rather than to simply mimic their environment.|$|R

40|$|Innate {{preferences}} {{promote the}} capacity of pollinators to find flowers. Honeybees and bumblebees have strong preferences for &# 039;blue&# 039; stimuli, and flowers of this colour typically present higher nectar rewards. Interestingly, flowers from multiple different locations around the world independently have the same distribution in bee colour space. Currently, however, there is a paucity of data on the innate colour preferences of stingless bees that are often implicated as being key pollinators {{in many parts of}} the world. In Australia, the endemic stingless bee Tetragonula carbonaria is widely distributed and known to be an efficient pollinator of both native plants and agricultural crops. In controlled laboratory conditions, we tested the innate <b>colour</b> <b>responses</b> of na < ve bees using standard broadband reflectance stimuli representative of common flower colours. Colorimetric analyses considering hymenopteran vision and a hexagon colour space revealed a difference between test colonies, and a significant effect of green contrast and an interaction effect of green contrast with spectral purity on bee choices. We also observed colour preferences for stimuli from the blue and blue-green categorical regions of colour space. Our results are discussed in relation to the similar distribution of flower colours observed from bee pollination around the world...|$|R
