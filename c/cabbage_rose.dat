Such a tiger-lily on my table, and the pretty {{delicate}} achimenes, and the stephanotis {{climbing up the}} verandah, and a bignonia by its side, with honeysuckle all over the steps, and jessamine all over the two water-tanks at {{the angle of the}} verandah. The Melanesians have, I think, twenty-nine flower gardens, and they bring the flowers, &c.--lots of flowers, and the oleanders are a sight! Some azaleas are doing well, verbenas, hibiscus of all kinds. Roses and, alas! clove carnations, and stocks, and many of the dear old cottage things won't grow well. Scarlet passion flowers and splendid Japanese lilies of perfect white or pink or spotted. The golden one I have not yet dared to buy. They are most beautiful. I like both the red and the yellow tritoma; we have both. But I don't think we have the perfume of the English flowers, and I miss the clover and buttercup. And what would I give for an old-fashioned <b>cabbage</b> <b>rose,</b> as big as a saucer, and for fresh violets, which grow here but have little scent, and lilies of the valley! Still more, fancy seeing a Devonshire bank in spring, with primroses and daisies, or meadows with cowslip and clover and buttercups, and hearing thrushes and blackbirds and larks and cuckoos, and seeing trout rise to the flies on the water! There is much exaggeration in second-rate books about tropical vegetation. You are really much better off than we are. No trees equal English oaks, beeches, and elms, and chestnuts; and with very little expense and some care, you have any flowers you like, growing out of doors or in a greenhouse. You can make a warmer climate, and we can't a colder one. [...] But we have plenty to look at for all that. There, what a nice hour I have spent in chatting with you!' ...|$|E

They are derived from Rosa × centifolia, a hybrid that {{appeared}} in the 17th century in the Netherlands, related to damask roses. They are named for their [...] "one hundred" [...] petals; they are often called [...] "cabbage" [...] roses due to the globular shape of the flowers. The centifolias are all once-flowering. As a class, they are notable for their inclination to produce mutations of various sizes and forms, including moss roses and some of the first miniature roses (see below). Examples: 'Centifolia', 'Paul Ricault'.|$|R

In 1980, Helen Combs, a veteran contractor who had restored dozens of older mansions in Louisville, purchased it for $355,000. She described the restoration process as unique, even for her, saying [...] "The windows were out, plastic was over them, there was no furniture....

Differing from other Caucasian rugs, antique Seychour rugs do not share the same symmetry in their borders; they do however, share a similar flat-woven structure.

5000|$|P. lawrencei has a noticeably tufted {{habit and}} is easily {{identified}} by its sage-green leaves [...] which {{are no more}} than 5mm long.These leaves are tightly congested and can be said to resemble a small <b>cabbage</b> or <b>rose.</b> They are covered in very fine, small and white hairs. Beneath the tightly grouped sets of leaves, stems elongate at a rate which is equal to the rate at which new leaves are produced. It is therefore difficult to identify which leaves are connected to which stem. This is the main method for how this species spreads across the alpine landscape. From the centre of the small ‘rosette’ emerges a white, small daisy like flower between December- March. The fruit of this species is an achene.|$|R
50|$|Emile Elisee Maclet {{was the son}} of a {{gardener}} who lived in Lyons-en Santerre in Picardy. He was born there in 1881. Since his family was poor, he began to work at an early age as an assistant to his father. Picardy is renowned for its roses, and Maclet used to say that he was born among <b>cabbages</b> and <b>roses.</b> By the mysterious alchemy of genius, the gardener’s son wielded a painter’s brush almost as soon as he swung a pick and hoe. His father was not only {{a gardener}}, but also the sexton of the parish church, so the boy inevitably became a choirboy. That brought him to the attention of the local priest, Father Delval, who as well as being the parish priest was also a painter, and often on fine Sundays, when Vespers were over, he and young Maclet set out to sketch and paint along the roads or the banks of streams.|$|R
50|$|The Moss roses {{are based}} on one or more mutations, {{particularly}} one that appeared early on Rosa × centifolia, the Provence or <b>cabbage</b> <b>rose.</b> Some with Damask roses as a parent may be derived from a separate mutation. Thickly growing or branched resin-bearing hairs, particularly on the sepals, give off a pleasant woods or balsam scent when rubbed. Moss roses are cherished for this trait, but as a group they have not contributed {{to the development of}} new rose classifications. Various hybrids with other roses have yielded different forms, such as the modern miniature creeping moss rose 'Red Moss Rambler' (Ralph S. Moore, 1990). Moss roses with centifolia background are once-flowering; some moss roses exhibit repeat-blooming, indicative of Autumn Damask parentage. Examples: 'Common Moss' (centifolia-moss), 'Mousseline', also known as 'Alfred de Dalmas' (Autumn Damask moss).|$|E

The album cover of Darkness, which features Springsteen lounging against pale-flowered, <b>Cabbage</b> <b>Rose</b> wall-paper, was taken in Stefanko's bedroom in 1978. The entire E-Street Band came down, and were photographed in the same environs.

40|$|Rosa centifolia {{is one of}} {{the famous}} oil {{producing}} species of roses, used to extract oil and other products. The present study was performed at Institute of Horticultural Sciences, University of Agriculture Faisalabad (Pakistan) to evaluate the morphological and genetic diversity among different genotypes of Rosa centifolia taken from Pakistan and USA and to develop an in vitro propagation protocol for mass production of healthy plants round the year. For study morphological diversity 24 plant, leaf and flower parameters were selected from (UPOV) plant descriptor. Data of these parameters from 8 genotypes of Rosa centifolia found in 8 districts of Punjab, Pakistan and 8 genotypes found in USA was collected according to the descriptor. Young unopened leaves of these genotypes were collected for DNA extraction through CTAB method, which was used for genetic analysis by SSR markers. For in vitro propagation of Rosa centifolia young axillary buds were used as explant. Different concentrations of BAP (0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6 and 0. 8 Ã¬M) and Kinetin (0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6 and 0. 8 Ã¬M) alone and in combination were used for shoot formation. For root induction various concentrations of IBA (0. 2, 0. 4 and 0. 6 Ã¬M) and NAA (0. 2, 0. 4 and 0. 6 Ã¬M) were used. Statistical analysis was performed on the data by using SAS statistical analysis (Version 9. 3) software. Principle component analysis was used to indicate the morphological diversity among 8 genotypes of Rosa centifolia in Pakistan and 8 from USA. It showed the highest phenotypic diversity between Sargodha and Sheikhupura genotypes while maximum similarity was observed between Pattoki and Faisalabad genotypes. Among 8 genotypes of Rosa centifolia from USA, maximum phenotypic association was noticed within Fantin- Latour and Rosa de Meaux while maximum diversity was between <b>Cabbage</b> <b>rose</b> 2 and Paul Ricault. During studying genetic diversity by using SSR markers genetic similarity was observed among the genotypes of one district but genotype of different districts expressed genetic diversity, which was maximum between Kahror Pakka and Pattoki genotypes but minimum between Faisalabad and Sheikhupura genotypes from Pakistan. Rosa centifolia of Pakistan and <b>Cabbage</b> <b>rose</b> 2 of USA were in the same group, which reflect genetic relationship between them. During comparison of Rosa centifolia with Rosa damascena, Pakistani genotypes of Rosa centifolia were genetically more closer to Rosa damascena genotype from Isfahan (Iran) and Pattoki (Pakistan). Rosa damascena Faisalabad was in separate group than other Rosa damascena genotypes and showed closer genetic association with Rose de Meaux and Gros Choux dâ€™Hollande. During in vitro propagation of Rosa centifolia BAP at 0. 4 Ã¬M along with 0. 2 Ã¬M of Kinetin produced shoots with minimum number of days (10. 20). BAP at concentration of 0. 2 Ã¬M proved as prominent by producing maximum number of shoots (1. 93) while 0. 2 Ã¬M BAP in combination with 0. 2 Ã¬M Kinetin produced shoots with maximum shoot length (5. 55 cm). MS media supplemented with higher concentration (0. 4 Ã¬M and 0. 6 Ã¬M) of BAP along with 0. 2 Ã¬M Kinetin first produced callus on the explants and after few days it also produced the shoots. In case of root induction 0. 4 Ã¬M IBA proved excellent and produced roots with minimum number of days (10. 07), maximum number of roots (2. 47) and maximum root length (4. 21 cm) ...|$|E
