40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades, <b>business</b> <b>news</b> has become an area of growth in most industrialized countries. This report, {{which is part of}} a Nordic {{research}} project on the rise of the business press, describes how the field of <b>business</b> <b>news</b> production has evolved in Denmark. Based on a large quantitative analysis of news content in two Danish dailies, "Berlingske Tidende" and "Børsen", the report first shows how a market for <b>business</b> <b>news</b> has developed, and then shows how the volume of <b>business</b> <b>news</b> has expanded and the content features and formats of <b>business</b> <b>news</b> have changed with the development of the field.

40|$|This {{research}} is a corpus-based study with both {{quantitative and qualitative}} approaches {{with the aim of}} ascertaining the lexical features of <b>business</b> <b>news</b> so as to assist Taiwan's university students in reading <b>business</b> <b>news</b> articles for better comprehension. For this study, a 1. 23 million-word corpus was created by collecting <b>business</b> <b>news</b> articles from English language newspapers published in Taiwan. This corpus was used to investigate the word frequency of <b>business</b> <b>news</b> genre. Based on the word frequency, other lexical features were also investigated. These features include word type distribution, coverage of the General Service Word List (GSL) and the Academic Word List (AWL) in the corpus, the applications of Zipf's Law and Powers' vocabulary prediction theory on the <b>business</b> <b>news</b> genre, and an analysis of the lexical difficulty of articles written by local journalists based in Taiwan and by press agency journalists. The suitability of the vocabulary in Business English textbooks commonly used in Taiwan's universities was also assessed in this study. In light of there being no <b>business</b> <b>news</b> word lists available, two word lists - one general with 2, 200 words, the other business-specific with 700 words - were compiled, based on the corpus created for this study. The first word list aims to help students gain a lexical knowledge which can cover 95 % of <b>business</b> <b>news</b> text; the second one, narrowed down from the first word list, is a condensed, quick- view word list of business terminology. These two word lists, derived from a <b>business</b> <b>news</b> genre, were created for EFLlESL students to prioritise, and aims to help students make efficient and effective progress in their comprehension of <b>business</b> <b>news.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
