For many meter designs, including electromagnetic induction meters (also known as magnetic flow meters), the greatest accuracy is achieved when the device is calibrated correctly. Optimal meter accuracy often depends on the flow conditions associated with the upstream geometry in the pipe system. Manufacturers typically give standards {{for the length of}} <b>straight</b> <b>pipe</b> required upstream of the meter. These standards vary, however, and do not address every possible configuration that may be installed upstream of the <b>straight</b> <b>pipe</b> requirement. An investigation on the effects of the length of <b>straight</b> <b>pipe</b> between a single 90 ° elbow and the upstream side of magnetic flow meters was completed in this research. Eleven 10 -inch meters were chosen for testing. The procedure included a baseline test with more than forty diameters of <b>straight</b> <b>pipe</b> between the elbow and the meter. The accuracy of the meter was determined over a range of flow velocities typical for operation of this type and size of meter.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{estimation of}} the total pipeline air pressure drop is considered widely {{to be one of}} the most important aspects of pneumatic conveying system design. Since there are numerous influential parameters, such as velocity, particle properties, pipe length, diameter and material, the determination of the total pipeline air pressure drop in pipelines of different length, diameter, step and bend number is based largely on the scale-up of test rig data. In many systems, the air-only component of pressure drop is significant (e. g. dilutephase, long-distance conveying). This thesis modifies initially the correlations for predicting pressure drop caused by an incompressible fluid flowing through bends and <b>straight</b> sections of <b>pipe.</b> These correlations are sufficientiy accurate as long as mean conditions (based on average air density) for each <b>straight</b> <b>pipe</b> and conditions at the outlet of each bend are used in the analysis. Based on detailed mathematical and dimensional analyses, semi-empirical correlations then are set up for predicting the pressure drop due to the presence of solids in bends and <b>straight</b> <b>pipes.</b> Fly ash is used as the test material. B y using the data from any constant diameter pipeline with one bend and two long <b>straight</b> <b>pipes,</b> the exponents in the semi-empirical correlations are determined. These correlations then are used to predict the total pipeline air pressure drop in pipelines of different length, diameter and bend number. A close agreement between predicted and experimental results is obtained as long as there are no short <b>straight</b> <b>pipes</b> in the pipeline. However, in industry, short <b>straight</b> <b>pipes</b> are in <b>c</b> o m m o n use. It is found that the previously 2 ̆ 7 determined 2 ̆ 7 values of exponents underpredict significantly the total pipeline air pressure drop in pipelines that contain short <b>straight</b> <b>pipes.</b> Therefore, the semi-empirical correlation for bend pressure drop is modified by determining the exponents from data obtained on a simple configuration of constant diameter pipeline, which comprises two bends and three sections of pipe, two long and one short. The operating conditions of several pipeline having different lengths and diameters are predicted accurately and this demonstrates the good reliability and stability of this n e w scale-up procedure. Finally, the results from two other test materials with significantly different particle properties (viz. pulverised coal and plastic pellets) demonstrate further the high accuracy and reliability of the scale-up procedure developed in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} tests are carried out to assess the effects of flow {{disturbance}} on a small dimension ultrasonic gas flowmeter. Flow disturbances generated by cone couplings, and single and double elbows are investigated. Measurements with a 100 D <b>straight</b> <b>pipe</b> upstream with a smooth connection to the meter body are used as a reference. Our measurements show that the symmetrical disturbance produced by a cone coupling at a 12 D distance from the transducer path does not impair {{the performance of the}} flowmeter. An asymmetrical disturbance, such as a single or a double elbow at the same distance, seems generally to give an underestimation of the flow velocity, resulting in reading errors of - 1 % or worse. Measurements with <b>straight</b> <b>pipes</b> of 10 D, 20 D, 40 D and 80 D between the disturbance and the flowmeter have also been made showing that 10 D can cause an overestimation of flow velocity. Increasing the length of the <b>straight</b> <b>pipe</b> generally decreases the error. More than 80 D <b>straight</b> <b>pipe</b> between the disturbance and the flowmeter is required to give a result within ± 1 % of reference conditions.

The focus of the Task 2 work was directed towards furthering {{the understanding of the}} fracture behavior of long-radius elbows.

Large-scale, quasi-static and dynamic, pipe-system, elbow fracture experiments under combined pressure and bending loads were performed on elbows containing an internal surface crack at the extrados.

40|$|The {{process piping}} in the {{refinery}} plant {{does not always}} have <b>straight</b> <b>pipe</b> geometry. The configuration of these pipelines are usually zigzag or snake-like. The pipe fittings or joints including elbow pipes, blind-tee pipes, T-pipes, Y-pipes {{are found to be}} common in a refinery. One of the reasons why the pipelines are layed in zigzag or snake-like configuration is because of the limited space for the piping equipment even in the largest refineries. The aim of the thesis is to study the physical flow inside a pipe with focus on blind-tee and elbow pipes. Laminar flow regime with Reynolds number equals to 1000 is investigated in this study. The analysis utilizes CFD numerical simulations by using OpenFOAM to investigate the physical flow inside the studied pipes. The geometry of the pipes which are used in this study have a diameter (D) of 1 m, and the blind-tee length varied from 1 D to 5 D. In order to achieve the main objective, there are sub-objectives which need to be carried out. First, the laminar flow analysis of the <b>straight</b> <b>pipe</b> with a length 10 D is investigated as the base case of the study. Since the <b>straight</b> <b>pipe</b> is installed before and after the pipe joints in order to attain the fully developed desirable flow profile. Second, the geometry and mesh setup of the studied pipes are created by using Autodesk Inventor, GMSH and SALOME Software, starting with the <b>straight</b> <b>pipe,</b> and then followed by the blind-tee and elbow pipe. Third, the numerical analysis is carried out by performing OpenFOAM CFD simulations. Fourth, the sensitivity studies of different mesh elements, timesteps, and Reynolds number are carried out. Last, the results of the velocity profiles obtained from the numerical simulations are validated with the velocity profiles of laminar flow derived from the analytical solution of classical formula. Three-dimensional numerical simulations of fluid flow in the <b>straight</b> <b>pipe,</b> blind-tee, and elbow pipe are presented. In addition, the streamline, velocity contour, and pressure contour of the blind-tee and elbow pipe cases are shown. For the <b>straight</b> <b>pipe</b> case, the velocity profile in the pipe agrees well with the analytical solution of classical formula. For the blind-tee and elbow pipe cases, the velocity profile at the 5 D from the inlet and 5 D from the outlet have been checked for grid convergence studies. It is found that there are flow circulations, which occurs inside the blind-tee. Moreover, for the blind-tee with the tee lengths that are equal to 4 D and 5 D, fluid deposits would very likely occur, since the velocity inside this tee is very low...|$|R
