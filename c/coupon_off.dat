50|$|A {{fixed rate}} CMO tranche {{can be further}} {{restructured}} into an Interest Only (IO) tranche and a discount coupon fixed rate tranche. An IO pays a coupon only based on a notional principal, it receives no principal payments from amortization or prepayments. Notional principal {{does not have any}} cash flows but shadows the principal changes of the original tranche, and it is this principal off which the coupon is calculated. For example, a $100mm PAC tranche off 6% collateral with a 6% coupon ('6 off 6' or '6-squared') can be cut into a $100mm PAC tranche with a 5% coupon (and hence a lower dollar price) called a '5 off 6', and a PAC IO tranche with a notional principal of $16.666667mm and paying a 6% coupon. Note the resulting notional principle of the IO is less than the original principal. Using the example, the IO is created by taking 1% of <b>coupon</b> <b>off</b> the 6% original coupon gives an IO of 1% <b>coupon</b> <b>off</b> $100mm notional principal, but this is by convention 'normalized' to a 6% coupon (as the collateral was originally 6% coupon) by reducing the notional principal to $16.666667mm ($100mm / 6).|$|E
5000|$|Gaines, {{who bore}} a strong {{resemblance}} to actor Bert Lahr, {{had been a}} teacher, an elementary school principal, a munitions factory worker and a haberdasher. In 1933 he had just begun a new job as a salesperson at Eastern Color Printing, when, one day, as the story goes, {{in the process of}} throwing out some old Sunday newspapers, Max caught himself re-reading the color comics. It dawned on him that if packaged together they would make an excellent promotional device. Gaines immediately contacted Harry L. Wildenberg, Easternâ€™s sales manager and his direct superior. The two had been racking their brains trying to think up a promotional gimmick for one of their clients, Procter & Gamble, and a tabloid size book filled with full color Sunday comic reprints available for five cents and a label or <b>coupon</b> <b>off</b> any Procter & Gamble product, seemed like the perfect idea.

5000|$|As mentioned, ESSO petrol was a main sponsor and its {{distinctive}} oval sign appears on many Morestone models. ESSO-themed packaging was a main {{theme of the}} mid-1950s models and the boxes portrayed the name in 'portrait' style with box standing on end. Morestone's ESSO packaging is reminiscent of other companies that attempted to claim a market niche with unique box styles. Whereas Matchbox had 'Match'-boxes, Aurora had 'Cigar'-boxes, Charbens had little suitcases and Benbros had boxes that looked like TV sets, Morestone's ESSO line packaged vehicles in little boxes that looked like gas pumps (Rixon 2005, p. 39). One side of the box looked like (with end flap open) {{the face of an}} 'ESSO-Extra' petrol pump with a gallons gauge, while opposite sides illustrated the toy. The box front states [...] "ESSO Petrol Pump Series manufactured and produced by Morris & Stone (London) Ltd. by permission of the owners of the ESSO trademark" [...] (Rixon 2005, p. 39). Stores were supplied with colorful ESSO display stands which held the 20 Morestone vehicles in the series.

50|$|EasyGrowth Treasury Receipts (ETRs or 'eaters') {{are fixed}} income {{securities}} issued by Dean Witter Reynolds (later Morgan Stanley) in the 1980s. ETRs are zero-coupon bonds because they trade at a discount to par value(which is usually $1,000) and they mature at par and throughout their life they pay no interest(interest accrues as principal). For example if you purchased ETRs today that mature in 10 years you might pay $600 for one bond that will be valued at $1,000 (par) in 10 years. ETRs are also categorized as treasury receipts because the underlying securities are US Treasury Bonds therefore all payments are backed by U.S. Treasury securities. The most liquid zero-coupon bonds in the United States are called STRIPS, these are created by taking apart (or stripping) the <b>coupons</b> <b>off</b> of US Treasury Bonds.ETRs are no longer created because STRIPS are now the product of choice in this category due to their excellent liquidity and {{because they can be}} created (stripped) by any financial institution. Other treasury receipts were also created in the United States by other firms such as TBRs (E.F. Hutton), TIGRs (Merrill Lynch), CATS (Salomon Brothers) and COUGRs (A. G. Becker). Most treasury receipts were nicknamed after animals such as 'teddy bears' (TBRs), 'tigers' (TIGRs), 'cats' (CATS) and 'cougars' (COUGRs) but ETRs were named after a common fictitious character of the 1980s, E.T. from the hit movie.|$|R

50|$|Similarly if a {{fixed rate}} CMO tranche coupon is desired to be increased, then {{principal}} {{can be removed}} to form a Principal Only (PO) class and a premium fixed rate tranche. A PO pays no coupon, but receives principal payments from amortization and prepayments. For example, a $100mm sequential (SEQ) tranche off 6% collateral with a 6% <b>coupon</b> ('6 <b>off</b> 6') can be cut into an $92.307692mm SEQ tranche with a 6.5% coupon (and hence a higher dollar price) called a '6.5 off 6', and a SEQ PO tranche with a principal of $7.692308mm and paying a no coupon. The principal of the premium SEQ is calculated as (6 / 6.5) * $100mm, {{the principal of the}} PO is calculated as balance from $100mm.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{stochastic}} choice model, and supporting empirical analyses, {{to understand the}} effect of package coupons on brand choice. Package coupons can be broadly classified into three types: peel <b>off</b> <b>coupons,</b> on-pack coupons, and in-pack coupons. Our model helps understand the relative impact of these three types of coupons on market share. We find that on-pack coupons {{may lead to a}} higher market share than peel-off coupons. What makes this result potentially interesting is that while the benefit of a peel-off coupon is realized immediately, the consumer has to wait until the next purchase occasion to cash in the benefit of an on-pack coupon. Though we primarily examine situations where package coupons are dropped frequently, a scenario that is quite representative of today's marketplace, we show that our results are also applicable when a manager is evaluating a particular coupon campaign. We compare the key predictions of our model with data collected from a series of in-store quasi-experiments.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} {{consumers}} use {{the value of a}} coupon as a source of information to estimate the regular price level. Study 1 demonstrates that the higher the percentage discount on a coupon (20 % vs. 10 %), the higher the estimated regular price. Study 2 demonstrates the same effect for cents <b>off</b> <b>coupons</b> using a cross-section of 152 coupons with values ranging from 15 c&#x 0338; to $ 2. Brands offering higher value coupons are estimated to be higher priced. Both studies also show that the mere presence of a price promotion leads to higher price expectations. We then demonstrate that the use of coupon value as a source of information in making judgments of regular price is contingent on whether consumers have alternate sources of information available to them while making price judgments. Studies 3 - 5 examine how the presence of alternate brand or context-related price cues moderates this effects. Study 3 demonstrates that when consumers know past prices, the higher the coupon value, the lower the price expectation; but this is not so when consumers are not aware of past prices. Study 4 shows the same pattern of results using different operationalizations of alternate price information: prices of non-promoted lines of the same brand, and brand name. Finally, Study 5 demonstrates that the use of coupon value as a signal for price is inversely related to the availability and diagnosticity of competitive prices for making a price decision. The results are discussed in terms of the informational effects of price promotions. Managerial implications for the communication of coupon related promotions for new product introductions are discussed...|$|R
