500|$|Following the Persian {{campaign}} the 64th {{returned to}} India arriving in Bombay {{only two weeks}} after the first unrest had occurred in Meerut. [...] The regiment was immediately ordered {{to take part in the}} Cawnpore relief force under Major-General Sir Henry Havelock. The relief force did not reach Cawnpore before the city fell under rebel control, a forced march was therefore ordered and the first clash with the rebel forces occurred at Fatehpur. From there a number of skirmishes took place until the force met with the rebels in a significant engagement at Ahwera on 16 July. [...] It was for his actions in this battle that Lieutenant Henry Havelock of the 10th Foot was awarded the Victoria Cross. [...] This award created considerable discontent within the 64th as the citation inferred that it was only due to Lt Havelock's actions that the regiment advanced and achieved its objectives. The matter was referred to Sir Colin Campbell, Commander in Chief, India who upheld the <b>complaint</b> <b>raised</b> and voiced strong criticism of staff officers— Havelock was serving as Aide-de-camp to his father— interfering with regimental officers doing their duty. The relief force entered Cawnpore on 17 July 1857. [...] Subsequently elements of the regiment played a small part in the relief of Lucknow but the majority of the regiment remained in Cawnpore and it was here that, on 28 November 1857, Drummer Thomas Flinn won the only Victoria Cross awarded to a member of the regiment for tackling two enemy artillerymen despite having been wounded himself. Subsequently the regiment moved to Fatehgarh and remained there for the rest of the campaign until June 1859 when it returned to Bombay. [...] A single battle honour Lucknow was awarded to the regiment.|$|E
