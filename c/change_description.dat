40|$|International audienceIn component-based {{software}} engineering, software architectures govern {{not only}} software development but also software evolution. Indeed, to efficiently and accurately manage software evolution and guarantee its quality, architecture models {{should be at}} the core of the evolution process, be accurately synchronized with the runtime systems and have their changes and version information be completely tracked. As architecture models are often captured by ADLs (Architecture Description Languages), an ADL supporting architecture-centric evolution is required. In this paper, we study how architecture-centric evolution can be supported by the Dedal ADL. We thus propose a dedicated CDL (<b>Change</b> <b>Description</b> Language) which models architectural changes as first-class entities and describes them from a semantic viewpoint...|$|E

The first goal, responsiveness, is best accommodated by limiting the number of attributes that the inference engine takes into consideration.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new software architecture for consistency management: Change Propagation and Response Graphs (CPRGs). Components encapsulate data and behaviour, for example a dialog box component encapsulates a dialog box's size, location and manipulation functions. Relationships connect components, for example, a dialog box component to the edit field and button controls it contains. Relationships {{are also used}} to propagate <b>descriptions</b> of <b>changes</b> that components undergo to related components. A component interprets these <b>change</b> <b>descriptions,</b> updating its state to maintain intercomponent consistency. Components can also store <b>change</b> <b>descriptions,</b> which allows many additional conistency management techniques to be supported in a homogeneous way. These include multiple view consistency, undo/redo and versioning facilities, lazy and incremental consistency management, and inconsistency management. The software architecture for CPRGs encapsulates these facilities, so programmers {{do not have to}} use ad-hoc implementation techniques to use them. The paper commences with a description of common consistency management requirements. The basic CPRG architecture is then introduced, followed by a discussion of CPRG applications that illustrate the flexibility and homogeneity of the approach. An implemention of the CPRG model in an object-oriented programming language is described followed by a description of experience using this framework. The CPRG approach is then compared and contrasted to existing consistency management approaches. Page...|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{research}} on geodata uncertainty {{has been conducted}} in the past decades, mostly related to modeling, quantifying, and communicating uncertainty. But findings on if and how users can incorporate this information into spatial analyses are still rare. In this paper we address these questions {{with a focus on}} land cover change analysis. We conducted semi-structured interviews with three expert groups dealing with change analysis in the fields of climate research, urban development, and vegetation monitoring. During the interviews we used a software prototype to show change scenarios that the experts had analyzed before, extended by visual depiction of uncertainty related to land cover change. This paper describes the study, summarizes results, and discusses findings as well as the study method. Participants came up with several ideas for applications that could be supported by uncertainty, for example, identification of erroneous <b>change,</b> <b>description</b> of change detection algorithm characteristics, or optimization of change detection parameters. Regarding the aspect of reasoning with uncertainty in land cover change data the interviewees saw potential in better-informed hypotheses and insights about change. Communication of uncertainty information to users was seen as critical, depending on the users’ role and expertise. We judge semi-structured interviews to be suitable {{for the purpose of this}} study and emphasize the potential of qualitative methods (workshops, focus groups etc.) for future uncertainty visualization studies...|$|E

40|$|Neural {{activity}} and perception are both affected by sensory history. The work presented here explores {{the relationship between}} the physiological effects of adaptation and their perceptual consequences. Perception is modeled as arising from an encoder-decoder cascade, in which the encoder is defined by the probabilistic response of a population of neurons, and the decoder transforms this population activity into a perceptual estimate. Adaptation is assumed to produce changes in the encoder, and we examine the conditions under which the decoder behavior is consistent with observed perceptual effects in terms of both bias and discriminability. We show that for all decoders, discriminability is bounded from below by the inverse Fisher information. Estimation bias, on the other hand, can arise for a variety of different reasons and can range from zero to substantial. We specifically examine biases that arise when the decoder is fixed, “unaware ” of the changes in the encoding population (as opposed to “aware ” of the adaptation and changing accordingly). We simulate the effects of adaptation on two well-studied sensory attributes, motion direction and contrast, assuming a gain <b>change</b> <b>description</b> of encoder adaptation. Although we cannot uniquely constrain the source of decoder bias, we find for both motion and contrast that an “unaware ” decoder that maximizes the likelihood of the percept given by the preadaptation encoder leads to predictions that are consistent with behavioral data. This model implies that adaptation-induced biases arise as a result of temporary suboptimality of the decoder...|$|E
