500|$|The Roman satirist Juvenal {{wrote in}} AD 82 of rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno ("a rare {{bird in the}} lands, and very like a black swan"). He meant {{something}} whose rarity would <b>compare</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a black swan, or in other words, as a black swan did not exist, neither did the supposed characteristics of the [...] "rare bird" [...] with which it was being compared. The phrase passed into several European languages as a popular proverb, including English, in which the first four words ("a rare bird in the land") are often used ironically. For some 1500 years, the black swan existed in the European imagination {{as a metaphor for}} that which could not exist.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Paratheria" [...] {{was coined}} by British mammalogist Oldfield Thomas in 1887 {{in a review}} of tooth {{development}} in mammals. He found that the [...] "Edentata" [...] were especially distinctive. In this group, he included the sloths, anteaters, and armadillos, which are still placed together as Xenarthra, as well as the pangolins and the aardvark. According to Thomas, edentate teeth would be derived from the very earliest stage of mammalian dental evolution. Consequently, he suggested that they should be given a grouping separate from the other major groupings of mammals, for which terms had been introduced by Thomas Huxley: Eutheria (placentals) and Metatheria (marsupials). For this new grouping, he suggested the name Paratheria [...] "to indicate their position by the side of, but separate from, the other Mammals" [...] (the Greek παρά para means [...] "beside"). Thomas had included one other mammal among the edentates, the aardvark; however, he was unable to provide a satisfactory scenario for the origin of its wholly unique dentition, which he could only <b>compare</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> some fish. Thomas's arrangement was foreshadowed by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville's 1839 classification; he placed edentates (except the sloth Bradypus, which he considered to be a primate) as a major division, the Maldentés ("poorly toothed"). This group was considered to be distinct from the other monodelphes (placentals), the Bien dentés ("well-toothed"). Similarly, Paul Gervais proposed in 1855 that edentates should be placed in a separate subclass of mammals.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} intestinal permeability changes over a range of physiologically relevant intestinal injury. The experiments were performed in 80 rats subdivided into four groups as aspirin (400 mg/kg b. w.), gum Acacia (1 g. /day) and aspirin with gum Acacia groups for 21 days <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> control group. Relative reabsorption of L-Histidine was greater(p< 0. 001) in the aspirin in 10 min <b>of</b> incubation <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the control rats. In aspirin in combination with gum Acacia, the relative reabsorption were significantly (p< 0. 001) decrease in 10, 20 and 30 min. <b>of</b> incubation <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the control rats. Moreover, the relative reabsorption of L-histidine was significantly (p< 0. 01) reduced by the aspirin at 45 min of time of the incubation buffer <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the control. However, gum acacia treatment was increased at 10 min (p< 0. 01), 30 min (p< 0. 01) and 45 min (p< 0. 001) respectively <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the control rats. Relative reabsorption of L-histidine record a nonsignificant increase of aspirin at 20 min and 30 min <b>of</b> incubation <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the control. Gum and aspirin with gum at 20 min and 45 min of incubation resulted an increase and decrease in relative reabsorption <b>of</b> L-histidine respectively <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the control. Aspirin and aspirin in combination with gum acacia treatment increased body, intestinal weights and mucosal total protein significantly with percent changes ranged from 8 % to 40 % <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the control. On the other hand, gum treatment decreased body, intestinal weights and mucosal total protein significantly with percent changes ranged from 8 % to 35 % <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the control. These results demonstrated that L-histidine is actively taken up by a gum Acacia system in intestinal everted sac mechanism of rat with energy supplied by glucose and Na+in incubation buffer. Moreover, aspirin system had an inhibitory effect on L-histidine uptake in 45 min of incubation, indicating the saturation by L-histidine in first ten minuts of incubation. Also, these results provide evidence the uptake of L-histidine into rat intestine was not reduced at all by the treatment of aspirin. These results suggest <b>that</b> the uptake <b>of</b> L-histidine by intestinal everted sac of rat has different characteristics of aspirin <b>with</b> gum <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the control in respect to relative reabsorption of L-histidine...|$|R

60|$|Robert Ingersoll {{once said}} that the genial climate of California would in a fairly brief time evolve a race {{resembling}} the Mexicans, and that {{in two or three}} generations the Californians would be seen of a Sunday morning {{on their way to a}} cockfight with a rooster under each arm. Never was made a rasher generalisation, based on so absolute an ignorance of facts. It is to laugh. Here is a climate that breeds vigour, with just sufficient geniality to prevent the expenditure of most of that vigour in fighting the elements. Here is a climate where a man can work three hundred and sixty-five days in the year without the slightest hint of enervation, and where for three hundred and sixty-five nights he must perforce sleep under blankets. What more can one say? I consider myself somewhat of climate expert, having adventured among most of the climates of five out of the six zones. I have not yet been in the Antarctic, but whatever climate obtains there will not deter me from drawing the conclusion that nowhere is there a climate to <b>compare</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> this region. Maybe I am as wrong as Ingersoll was. Nevertheless I take my medicine by continuing to live in this climate. Also, it is the only medicine I ever take.|$|E
60|$|It takes {{courage to}} {{plunge into the}} boiling surf and to carry the rope to the {{breaking}} vessel. It takes courage to spring from the ship's side and support the struggling swimmer, never knowing the moment at which a flickering shadow may appear in the deep green water, and the tiger of the deep turn its white belly upwards as it dashes on its prey. There is courage too in the infantryman who takes a sturdy grip of his rifle and plants his feet firmly as he sees the Lancers sweeping down on his comrades and himself. But of all these types of bravery there is none that can <b>compare</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> our homely constable when he finds on the dark November nights that a door on his beat is ajar, and, listening below, learns {{that the time has}} come to show the manhood that is in him. He must fight odds in the dark. He must, single-handed, cage up desperate men like rats in a hole. He must oppose his simple weapon to the six-shooter and the life-preserver. All these thoughts, and the remembrance of his wife and children at home, and of how easy it would be not to observe the open door, come upon him, and then what does he do? Why, with the thought of duty in his heart, and his little cudgel in his hand, he goes to what is too often his death, like a valiant high-minded Englishman, who fears the reproach of his own conscience more than pistol bullet, or bludgeon stroke.|$|E
60|$|It {{may have}} been our {{comparative}} defeat with fashion in its most distinctive moments of pleasuring (for one thing I wished {{to see how the}} dreariness of Madrid gaiety in the Paseo de la Castellana would <b>compare</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Roman gaiety on the Pincian) which made us the more determined to see a bull-fight in the Spanish capital. We had vowed ourselves in coming to Spain to set the Spaniards an example of civilization by inflexibly refusing to see a bull-fight under any circumstances or for any consideration; but it seemed to us that it was a sort of public duty to go and see the crowd, what it was like, in the time and place where the Spanish crowd is most like itself. We would go and remain in our places till everybody else was placed, and then, when the picadors and banderilleros and matadors were all ranged in the arena, and the gate was lifted, and the bull came rushing madly in, we would rise before he had time to gore anybody, and go inexorably away. This union of self-indulgence and self-denial seemed almost an act of piety when we learned that the bull-fight was to be on Sunday, and we prepared ourselves with tickets quite early in the week. On Saturday afternoon it rained, of course, but the worst was that it rained on Sunday morning, and the clouds did not lift till noon. Then the glowing concierge of our hotel, a man so gaily hopeful, so expansively promising that I could hardly believe he was not an Italian, said that there could not possibly be a bull-fight that day; the rain would have made the arena so slippery that man, horse, and bull would all fall down together in a common ruin, with no hope whatever of hurting one another.|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} report authors qualitatively {{described}} that immersion cutting is particularly effective to make tool-life prolonged. 　In this report, {{for the purpose of}} verifying this in detail and quantitatively, authors compared the effect of immersion cutting with those of dry cutting and ordinary oiling in turning 18 - 8 stainless steel with a carbede bit. By the way cutting oils used are chlorinated oil and mixed oil. Consequently cutting speed for 60 minute tool-life can be increased 32 % (max.) <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> dry cutting, 19 % (max.) <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> ordinary oiling from the viewpoint of flank wear tool-life; from the viewpoint of crater tool-life cutting speed for 60 minute tool-life can be increased 21 %(max,) <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> dry cutting, 12 % <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> ordinary oiling.

6000|$|My {{return to}} Satanstoe {{occurred}} {{in the last half}} of the month of July. The Mordaunts were not to be at Lilacsbush until the middle of September, and I had near two months to wait for that happy moment. This time was passed as well as it could be. I endeavoured to interest myself in the old Neck, and to plan schemes of future happiness there, that were to be realized in Anneke's society. It was and is a noble farm; rich, beautifully placed, having water on more than three of its sides, in capital order, and well stocked with such apples, peaches, apricots, plums, and other fruits, as the world can scarcely equal. It is true that the provinces a little further south, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, think they can beat us in peaches; but I have never tasted any fruit that I thought would <b>compare</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Satanstoe. I love every tree, wall, knoll, swell, meadow, and hummock about the old place. One thing distresses me. I love old names, such as my father knew the same places by; and I like to mispronounce a word, when custom and association render the practice familiar. I would not call my friend, Dirck Follock, anything else but Follock, unless it might be in a formal way, or when asking him to drink a glass of wine with me, for a great deal. So it is with Satanstoe; the name is homely, I am willing to allow; but it is strong, and conveys an idea. It relates also to the usages and notions of the country; and names ought always to be preserved, except in those few instances in which there are good reasons for altering them. I regret to say, that ever since the appearance of Jason Newcome among us, there has been a disposition among the ignorant and vulgar, to call the Neck, Dibbleton; under the pretence I have already mentioned, that it once belonged to the family of Dibblees; or, as some think, as a pious diminutive of Devil's-Town. I indignantly repel this supposition; though, I do believe, that Dibbleton is only a sneaking mode of pronouncing Devilton; as, I admit, I have heard the old people laughingly term the Neck. This belongs to the [...] "Gaul darn ye" [...] school, and it is not to my taste. I say the ignorant and vulgar, for this is just the class to be squeamish on such subjects. I have been told--though I cannot say that I have heard it myself--but I am told, there have been people from the eastward among us of late years, who affect to call [...] "Hell-Gate," [...] "Hurl-Gate," [...] or [...] "Whirl-Gate," [...] or by some other such sentimental, whirl-a-gig name; and these are the gentry who would wish to alter [...] "Satanstoe" [...] into [...] "Dibbleton!" [...] Since the eastern troops have begun to come among us, indeed, they have commenced a desperate inroad on many of our old, venerated Dutch names; names that the English, direct from home, have generally respected. Indeed, change--change in all things, seems to be the besetting passion of these people. We, of New York, are content to do as our ancestors have done before us; and this they ridicule, making it matter of accusation against us, that we follow the notions of our fathers. I shall never complain that they are deserting so many of their customs; for, I regard the changes as improvements; but I beg that they may leave us ours.|$|E
