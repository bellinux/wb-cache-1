Perrin explains the order of the sayings by attempting to demonstrate that almost all adjacent sayings are connected by Syriac <b>catchwords,</b> whereas in Coptic or Greek, <b>catchwords</b> have been found for only {{less than half of the}} pairs of adjacent sayings.

Steven Bull quotes the <b>catchwords</b> in the Encyclopedia of Military Technology and Innovation (2004) as originating in 1941. John Williams' soundtrack includes the [...] "Cadillac of the Skies" [...] as an individual score cue.

500|$|After {{its release}} and success, Frederator Studios then pitched an Adventure Time series to Nicktoons, but the network passed on it twice. The studio then {{approached}} Cartoon Network. The network {{said they would}} be willing to produce the series if Ward could prove that [...] "the seven-minute short made for Nick wasn’t a one-hit wonder". Ward quickly retooled the concept of the pilot; he wanted a potential series to be [...] "fully realized", rather than feature the [...] "pre-school vibe" [...] that he believed defined the original pilot. Initially, Ward submitted a rough storyboard that featured Finn and an [...] "oblivious" [...] Princess Bubblegum going on a spaghetti-supper date. However, the network was not happy with this story, and specifically asked for an episode that contained the same things that had [...] "made the short so special, like the crazy opening dance, the 'Abe Lincoln moment,' funny <b>catchwords,</b> and the awkward princess/kiss moment at the end. Ward then created an early storyboard for the episode [...] "The Enchiridion!", which was his attempt to emulate the style of the original short. Eventually, Cartoon Network approved the first season in September 2008, and [...] "The Enchiridion!" [...] became the first episode to enter into production.|$|E

2500|$|Hudal {{said the}} justice of the Allies and the Soviets had {{resulted}} in show trials and lynchings, including the major trials at Nuremberg. In his memoirs he developed a curious theory about the economic causes of World War II, which allowed him to plainly justify for himself his acts in favour of Nazi and Fascist war criminals:"The Allies' War against Germany was not a crusade, but the rivalry of economic complexes for whose victory they had been fighting. This so-called business ... used <b>catchwords</b> like democracy, race, religious liberty and Christianity as a bait for the masses. All these experiences were the reason why I felt duty bound after 1945 to devote my whole charitable work mainly to former National Socialists and Fascists, especially to so-called 'war criminals'".|$|E

2500|$|The late Qing {{government}} had {{embarked on a}} grand plan, the [...] "New Policies", aimed at an integration of Mongolia into China and opened Han Chinese colonization and agricultural settlement. Many Mongols considered this act {{as a violation of}} the old agreements when they recognized authority of the Manchu dynasty, particularly the preservation of traditional social order on Mongolian lands, and thus began to seek independence. The collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, conducted under the nationalistic <b>catchwords</b> of the Han Chinese, {{led to the formation of}} the Republic of China; later the initial concept was called [...] "Five Races Under One Union". The newly founded Chinese state laid claim to all imperial territory, including Mongolia. Mongolian officials were clear that their subordination was to the Qing monarch and thus owed no allegiance to the new Chinese republic. While some Inner Mongols showed willingness to join the Republic of China, Outer Mongols, together with part of Inner Mongolia, declared independence of China. The Outer Mongols were helped by the White Russian troops of Baron R.F. von Ungern-Sternberg incursions following the Russian Revolution of 1917. The abolition of Mongolian autonomy by Xu Shuzheng in 1919 reawakened Mongolian the national independence movement. Two small resistance groups formed, later to become the Mongolian People's Party (renamed the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party), which sought independence and Russian protection.|$|E

6000|$|Something, no doubt, {{may often}} {{be gained by}} the mere {{cross-examination}} of <b>catchwords</b> and the exposure of platitudes. Popular government is no more free from <b>catchwords</b> and platitudes than any other political, religious, or social cause which interests a great many people, and {{is the subject of}} much discussion. Even the Historical Method has its own claptrap. But one must not make too much of these things. [...] "In order to love mankind," [...] said Helvétius, [...] "one must not expect too much from them." [...] And fairly to appreciate institutions you must not hold them up against the light that blazes in Utopia; you must not expect them to satisfy microscopic analysis, nor judge their working, which is inevitably rough, awkward, clumsy, and second-best, by the fastidious standards of closet logic.|$|E

60|$|This is not, of course, {{all that}} is to be, or even should be, said for these doctrines. Only, {{in the course of}} this chapter, the reader and I have agreed upon a few <b>catchwords,</b> and been looking at morals on a certain system; it was a pity to lose an {{opportunity}} of testing the <b>catchwords,</b> and seeing whether, by this system as well as by others, current doctrines could show any probable justification. If the doctrines had come too badly out of the trial, it would have condemned the system.

60|$|This {{has very}} largely {{happened}} to modern English religion; I {{have been in}} many churches, chapels, and halls where a confident pride in having got beyond creeds was coupled with quite a paralysed incapacity to get beyond <b>catchwords.</b> But wherever the falsity appears it comes from neglect of the same truth: that men should agree on a principle, that they may differ on everything else; that God gave men a law that they might turn it into liberties.|$|E
