50|$|In 2006, the BBC ran {{a series}} of {{programmes}} called The Lost World of Friese-Greene. The series, presented by Dan Cruickshank, included The Open Road, Claude Friese-Greene's film of his 1920s road trip from Land's End to John o' Groats. The Open Road was filmed using the Biocolour process, and the British Film Institute had to use computer processing of the images to suppress the <b>colour</b> <b>flicker</b> and remove the red and green fringes around rapidly moving objects.|$|E
50|$|Claude's father William {{began the}} {{development}} of an additive colour film process called Biocolour. This process produced the illusion of true colour by exposing each alternate frame of ordinary black-and-white film stock through two different coloured filters. Each alternate frame of the monochrome print was then stained red or green. Although the projection of Biocolour prints did provide a tolerable illusion of true colour, it suffered from noticeable <b>colour</b> <b>flicker</b> (a potentially headache-inducing defect known technically as 'colour bombardment') and from red-and-green fringing around anything in the scene that moved very rapidly. In an attempt to overcome these problems, a faster-than-usual frame rate was used.|$|E

After we had {{been in and out}} of several shops, we saw two different elegant-looking wool materials in Fat Yanko’s store at Bahçekapısı (between Eminönü and Sirkeci in Istanbul, now called Bahçekapı). One of them was quite dark red, resembling the cherry colour, and the other a rich yellow with a touch of orange. When the sales clerk made the two fabrics fly together with a twist of his hand they became so bright that it reminded us of the beauty of a goldfinch. We thought we were looking at the <b>colours</b> <b>flickering</b> in burning fire. We were picturing the yellow-red flames shining on our team and dreaming that it would take us to victories. Indeed it did.” ...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} simultaneous {{observations in}} 3 bands (UBV) of the flickering variability of the recurrent novae RS Oph and T CrB at quiescence. Using new and published data, we compare the <b>colours</b> of the <b>flickering</b> in cataclysmic variables and symbiotic recurrent novae. We find {{a difference between}} the <b>colours</b> of the <b>flickering</b> source in these two types of accreting white dwarfs. The detected difference is highly significant with p-value ≈ 2 × 10 ^- 6 for the distributions of (U-B) _ 0 colour and p ≈ 3 × 10 ^- 5 on (U-B) versus (B-V) diagram. The possible physical reasons are briefly discussed. The data are available upon request from the authors. Comment: accepted in Astronomische Nachrichten (Astronomical Notes) : 2015, AN 336...|$|R
50|$|There are, however, {{technical}} and political obstacles for adopting a single worldwide video format. The most important technical {{problem is that}} quite often the lighting of the scene is achieved with lamps which flicker at a rate related to the local mains frequency. For instance the mercury lighting used in stadiums (twice the mains frequency). Capturing video under such conditions must be done at a matching rate, or the <b>colours</b> will <b>flicker</b> badly on the screen. Even an AC incandescent light may {{be a problem for}} a camera if it is underpowered or near the end of its useful life.|$|R
40|$|This bachelor´s thesis {{deals with}} fire {{detection}} in video recording. The {{aim is to}} design and create a fire detector to detect incipient fire. Fire detection takes advantage of some properties of fire, which can be recorded on a camera, such as <b>colour</b> of fire, <b>flickering</b> of flames and pulsating of {{intensity of light emitted}} by fire. When fire is detected the detector highlights a fire area and a warning message is displayed in standard output...|$|R

The album’s lead single “World Soul” was premiered on 29 April through Stereogum {{and has been}} described as a clinic on layering synths and electro atmospheric sounds. The announcement also included a first play on Huw Stephen's show on BBC Radio 1. On the 15th June, the video for 'World Soul' was premiered via Clash Magazine, who describe it as [...] "a feast for the eyes - <b>flickering</b> <b>colour,</b> hypnotic shapes and more".|$|R
40|$|Classical {{phenomena}} of contrast colours are obtained {{by placing a}} light achromatic circle surrounded by a coloured annular region (say, red) : the circle no longer appears achromatic, but is tinged with the opponent hue. Here, we present a new phenomenon: when the red annulus is temporally modulated with an annulus also achromatic as the inner circle, observers perceive a greenish annulus surrounding a circle which now appears reddish. We call this phenomenon contrast <b>colour</b> from <b>flicker</b> (CCFF). We determined the temporal characteristics of the CCFF, associated with inversion of the perceived colour of the circle, along different colours of the annulus and different spatial contexts. We found that both phenomena persist when changing the annulus colour to blue, green, or yellow, and are strongly affected by background context. However, they differ in the temporal dynamics: both phenomena occur over the whole scale from several milliseconds up to two minutes, but CCFF depends on an instantaneous adaptation mechanism for colour appearance. This suggests that these phenomena may depend on different adaptation mechanisms...|$|R
50|$|A fairly {{accurate}} port of R-Type {{was released}} for the PC Engine and TurboGrafx 16 consoles, although both versions {{suffered from a}} slightly lower resolution, reduced <b>colour</b> palette, sprite <b>flickering</b> and slow down. Due to the slightly reduced resolution, the playfield also scrolls slightly in the vertical axis whenever the player's ship approaches the top or bottom of the screen. The Japanese release for the PC Engine was split across two game cards (HuCards) titled R-Type I (Āru Taipu Wan) and R-Type II (Āru Taipu Tsū) and the later North American release for the TurboGrafx-16 contained the entire game on a single card. The PC Engine version of R-Type is notable for having a boss {{at the end of}} Stage 6, rather than a prolonged wave of enemies as in all other versions.|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews non-standard, {{clinical}} vision {{tests that}} may be used to detect the earliest visual loss in age-related maculopathy (ARM), before fundus changes are detected. We recommend a clinical test battery for all patients aged 60 years and older, comprising low luminance/low contrast (SKILL) VA or low contrast VA, desaturated D- 15 <b>colour</b> vision assessment, <b>flicker</b> perimetry, glare recovery and dark adaptation if possible, together with conventional assessments of case history, ophthalmoscopy and high contrast visual acuity (VA) for the detection and diagnosis of ARM. Reading rate is also discussed as a potential indicator of early visual loss. For monitoring the progressive visual loss in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and determining the requirements for optometric vision rehabilitation, we recommend more conventional clinical vision tests of distance and near visual acuity, reading rate, the effects of varying illumination and a functional central visual field assessment.

6000|$|Mrs. Brookenham was, in her forty-first year, still charmingly pretty, and {{the nearest}} {{approach}} she made {{at this moment}} to meeting her son's description of her was by looking beautifully desperate. She had about her the pure light of youth--would always have it; her head, her figure, her flexibility, her <b>flickering</b> <b>colour,</b> her lovely silly eyes, her natural quavering tone, all played together toward this effect by some trick that had never yet been exposed. It was {{at the same time}} remarkable that--at least in the bosom of her family--she rarely wore an appearance of gaiety less qualified than at the present juncture; she suggested {{for the most part the}} luxury, the novelty of woe, the excitement of strange sorrows and the cultivation of fine indifferences. This was her special sign--an innocence dimly tragic. It gave immense effect to her other resources. She opened the secretary with the key she had quickly found, then with the aid of another rattled out a small drawer; after which she pushed the drawer back, closing the whole thing. [...] "You terrify me--you terrify me," [...] she again said.|$|R
60|$|Which {{reminds me}} that the other day I saw the Lady herself {{in the shape of}} a tall woman of twenty-five or six, waiting for her tram on a street corner. She wore her almost flaxen-gold hair waved, and parted low on the forehead, beneath a black astrachan toque, with a red enamel maple-leaf hatpin in one side of it. This was the one touch of <b>colour</b> except the <b>flicker</b> of a buckle on the shoe. The dark, {{tailor-made}} dress had no trinkets or attachments, but fitted perfectly. She stood for perhaps a minute without any movement, both hands--right bare, left gloved--hanging naturally at her sides, the very fingers still, the weight of the superb body carried evenly on both feet, and the profile, which was that of Gudrun or Aslauga, thrown out against a dark stone column. What struck me most, next to the grave, tranquil eyes, was her slow, unhurried breathing in the hurry about her. She was evidently a regular fare, for when her tram stopped she smiled at the lucky conductor; and the last I saw of her was a flash of the sun on the red maple-leaf, the full face still lighted by that smile, and her hair very pale gold against the dead black fur. But the power of the mouth, the wisdom of the brow, the human comprehension of the eyes, and the outstriking vitality of the creature remained. That is how I would have my country drawn, were I a Canadian--and hung in Ottawa Parliament House, for the discouragement of prevaricators.|$|R
40|$|Chromatic Aberration {{is a film}} {{installation}} which {{explores the}} early technologies of colour filmmaking drawn from the archives of George Eastman House, Rochester, New York. Featuring vibrant close-ups of eyes from fledgling archival experiments in colour film, Chromatic Aberration turns the cinematic lens in on itself: from the prosthetic recording eye of the camera, to an evocation of the abstract inner screen of one's eyelids. Early 1920 s colour film footage - mainly tests shots featuring members of George Eastman's family as well as Hollywood stars of the time - is shot {{in such a way}} so as to reveal the inherent chromatic fringing, distortion and misalignment. Using specialist equipment at the BFI National Archive, London, the footage is reworked through the use of extreme close-up and magnification, honing in on the eyes. The installation evokes an imagined abstract <b>colour</b> world, a <b>flickering</b> eyelid trapped in a mechanical peephole. Exhibitions: Solo exhibition as film installation at Tyneside Cinema (Newcastle, Oct-Nov 2014); Solo exhibition at George Eastman Museum (Rochester, New York, Jan-April 2015), including a second work on display. Film festivals nominations for competitions: Winner of Best Vanguard Film Competition in Lima Independiente International Film Festival (Peru).

6000|$|This {{that follows}} {{happened}} on the coast twenty miles through the fields from Yokohama, at Kamakura, that is to say, where the great bronze Buddha sits facing the sea to hear the centuries go by. He has been described again and again--his majesty, his aloofness, {{and every one of}} his dimensions, the smoky little shrine within him, and the plumed hill that makes the background to his throne. For that reason he remains, as he remained from the beginning, beyond all hope of description--as it might be, a visible god sitting in the garden of a world made new. They sell photographs of him with tourists standing on his thumb nail, and, apparently, any brute of any gender can scrawl his or its ignoble name over the inside of the massive bronze plates that build him up. Think for a moment of the indignity and the insult! Imagine the ancient, orderly gardens with their clipped trees, shorn turf, and silent ponds smoking in the mist that the hot sun soaks up after rain, and the green-bronze image of the Teacher of the Law wavering there as it half seems through incense clouds. The earth is all one censer, and myriads of frogs are making the haze ring. It is too warm to do more than to sit on a stone and watch the eyes that, having seen all things, see no more--the down-dropped eyes, the forward droop of the head, and the colossal simplicity of the folds of the robe over arm and knee. Thus, and in no other fashion, did Buddha sit in the-old days when Ananda asked questions and the dreamer began to dream of the lives that lay behind him ere the lips moved, and as the Chronicles say: 'He told a tale.' This would be the way he began, for dreamers in the East tell something the same sort of tales to-day: 'Long ago when Devadatta was King of Benares, there lived a virtuous elephant, a reprobate ox, and a King without understanding.' And the tale would end, after the moral had been drawn for Ananda's benefit: 'Now, the reprobate ox was such an one, and the King was such another, but the virtuous elephant was I, myself, Ananda.' Thus, then, he told the tales in the bamboo grove, and the bamboo grove is there to-day. Little blue and gray and slate robed figures pass under its shadow, buy two or three joss-sticks, disappear into the shrine, that is, the body of the god, come out smiling, and drift away through the shrubberies. A fat carp in a pond sucks at a fallen leaf with just the sound of a wicked little worldly kiss. Then the earth steams, and steams in silence, and a gorgeous butterfly, full six inches from wing to wing, cuts through the steam in a zigzag of <b>colour</b> and <b>flickers</b> up to the forehead of the god. And Buddha said that a man must look on everything as illusion--even light and colour--the time-worn bronze of metal against blue-green of pine and pale emerald of bamboo--the lemon sash of the girl in the cinnamon dress, with coral pins in her hair, leaning against a block of weather-bleached stone--and, last, the spray of blood-red azalea that stands on the pale gold mats of the tea-house beneath the honey-coloured thatch. To overcome desire and covetousness of mere gold, which is often very vilely designed, that is conceivable; but why must a man give up the delight of the eye, colour that rejoices, light that cheers, and line that satisfies the innermost deeps of the heart? Ah, if the Bodhisat had only seen his own image! ...|$|R
