Yoshikawa et al.[18] observed that soft-start photoactivation can lead to better marginal adaptation of composite restorations. The pulse delay photoactivation method, which {{is a combination of}} low energy density followed by a lag period before a final high power density irradiation, can also decrease the intensity of polymerization stress [13, 14]. It was hypothesized that PD technique resulted in a polymer structure with lower cross-link density and that slow start polymerization techniques are associated with relatively few centers of polymer growth which may favor the formation of a more linear polymer structure with relatively few cross-links [19, 20]. On the other hand, a rapid standard <b>continuous</b> <b>cure</b> will initiate a multitude of growth centers and a polymer with a higher crosslink density.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} curing rate on softening in ethanol, degree of conversion, and wear of resin composites. METHOD: With a given energy density and for each of two different light-curing units (QTH or LED), the curing rate was reduced by modulating the curing mode. Thus, the irradiation of resin composite specimens (Filtek Z 250, Tetric Ceram, Esthet-X) was performed in a continuous curing mode and in a pulse-delay curing mode. Wallace hardness {{was used to determine}} the softening of resin composite after storage in ethanol. Degree of conversion was determined by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Wear was assessed by a three-body test. Data were submitted to Levene's test, one and three-way ANOVA, and Tukey HSD test (alpha = 0. 05). Results: Immersion in ethanol, curing mode, and material all had significant effects on Wallace hardness. After ethanol storage, resin composites exposed to the pulse-delay curing mode were softer than resin composites exposed to <b>continuous</b> <b>cure</b> (P< 0. 0001). Tetric Ceram was the softest material followed by Esthet-X and Filtek Z 250 (P< 0. 001). Only the restorative material had a significant effect on degree of conversion (P< 0. 001) : Esthet-X had the lowest degree of conversion followed by Filtek Z 250 and Tetric Ceram. Curing mode (P= 0. 007) and material (P< 0. 001) had significant effect on wear. Higher wear resulted from the pulse-delay curing mode when compared to continuous curing, and Filtek Z 250 showed the lowest wear followed by Esthet-X and Tetric Ceram...|$|E

After a seven-day incubation period, the composite specimens {{were removed from the}} teeth, embedded in self-curing resin and ground to half the orofacial width. Knoop microhardness was determined 100, 200, 500, 1000, 1500, 2500, 3500, 4500 and 5500 microm from the occlusal surface at a distance of 150 microm and 1000 microm from the metal matrix. The total degree of polymerization of a composite specimen for any given curing time and curing light was determined by calculating the area under the hardness curve. Hardness values 150 microm from the metal matrix never reached maximum values and were generally lower than those 1000 microm from the matrix. The hardest composite was usually encountered between 200 microm and 1000 microm from the occlusal surface. For every composite-curing time combination, there was an increase in microhardness at the top of each increment (measurements at 500, 2500 and 4500 microm) and a decrease towards the bottom of each increment (measurements at 1500, 3500 and 5500 microm). Longer curing times were usually combined with harder composite samples. Spectrum TPH composite was the only composite showing a satisfactory degree of polymerization for all three curing times and both LCUs. Multiple linear regression showed that only the curing time (p < 0. 001) and composite material (p < 0. 001) had a significant association with the degree of polymerization.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effi cacy of new light-emitting diode (LED) curing units in the hardening of Class II composite restorations. Methods and Materials: Disk specimens 2 mm in diameter and 2. 5 mm thick were pre-pared from 2 composites (Vit-l-escence, shade A 3, Ultradent; Herculite XRV, shade A 2, Kerr) in the following manner. An extracted permanent molar tooth was prepared to receive a Class II restoration with proximal slot only. The tooth was sectioned horizon-tally on a plane above the gingival fl oor level such that the remaining depth of the proximal box was 4 mm. A Toffl emire matrix band and retainer were secured around the tooth. Composite specimens were placed below the tooth to coincide with the location of the slot opening at the bottom of the gingival fl oor. The specimens were subjected to light polymerization with various combinations of curing cycle and light unit: 1 of 3 <b>continuous</b> <b>curing</b> cycles (20 seconds, 40 seconds or 60 seconds) and 1 of 2 LED units (Utralume- 5, Ultradent; IQ Smartlite, Dentsply) or a control quartz–tungsten–halogen (QTH) unit (Optilux 501, Kerr). Specimens were stored at 37 °C for 24 hours. A hardness tester was used to obtain 4 measurements of Knoop hardness number (KHN) for each surface (upper and lower) of each specimen. Relative hardness (RH) was calculated as the KHN of the lower surface divided by the KHN of the upper surface. Data were analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s test. Results: ANOVA indicated signifi cant differences in mean RH among the groups (p < 0. 001). RH increased with increasing curing time. For the 60 -second cycle with Vit-l-escence composite, mean RH was 0. 47, 0. 25 and 0. 39 for the Ultralume- 5, IQ Smartlite and Optilux 501 curing units, respectively.

A low applied voltage favors uniform and non-scattering silver patterns while a high applied voltage results in ink scattering. Discrete droplets with 45 - 55 mu m in diameter and continuous tracks with 60 mu m in width are generated by using a 110 -mu m-cailber nozzle. The feature size of deposited patterns is about half of the nozzle caliber, and a finer resolution can be achieved with the introduction of smaller nozzle calibers.

Published data {{on the effects of}} combinations of mineral admixtures in concrete on the microstructural and performance-related properties under different curing regimes are comparatively little. Further the correlation of strength of concrete to its permeability and pore structure is also not clear. The main objective of this research is to study the performance of various combinations of fly ash/silica fume and slag/silica fume concretes under three different <b>curing</b> regimes, viz. <b>continuous</b> moist <b>curing,</b> no moist curing after demolding and air drying after 7 -days of initial moist curing. Six different concrete mixes were prepared with ordinary portland cement and a blend of portland cement and combinations of fly ash+silica fume and slag+silica fume The water-to-cementitious materials ratio of all the concrete mixtures was kept constant at 0. 45. The properties investigated included workability of the fresh concrete, engineering properties such as cube and modified cube compressive strength, flexural strength, dynamic modulus of elasticity, pulse velocity, shrinkage and swelling, permeability and microstructural properties such as porosity and pore size distribution. The results show that prolonged dry curing results in lower strengths, higher porosity, coarser pore structure and more permeable concretes. It was found that the loss in early age compressive strength due to incorporation of fly ash or slag can be compensated for by the addition of small amounts of silica fume. The engineering and microstructural properties and permeability of concretes containing fly ash or slag appear to be more sensitive to poor curing than the control concrete, with the sensitivity increasing with increasing amounts of fly ash or slag in the mixtures. The incorporation of high volumes of slag in the concrete mixtures refined the pore structure and produced concretes with very low porosity and threshold diameters. The results emphasize that a minimum 7 -day wet curing is needed for concrete with mineral admixtures to develop the full potential, and that continued exposure to a drying environment can have adverse effects on the long-term durability of inadequately cured slag or fly ash concretes. The results also confirm that compressive strength alone is not an adequate index to judge the performance of concrete, and the knowledge of the strength, pore structure and permeability are required for this purpose.

A smartphone overdependence management system that is based on scientific evidence is required. This study proposes the design, development and implementation of a smartphone overdependence management system for self-control of smart devices. Methods: The system architecture of the Smartphone Overdependence Management System (SOMS) primarily consists of four sessions of mental monitoring: (1) Baseline settlement session; (2) Assessment session; (3) Sensing & monitoring session; and (4) Analysis and feedback session. We developed the smartphone-usage-monitoring application (app) and MindsCare personal computer (PC) app to receive and integrate usage data from smartphone users. We analyzed smartphone usage data using the Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID). Based on the baseline settlement results, we designed a feedback service to intervene. We implemented the system using 96 participants for testing and validation. The participants were classified into two groups: the smartphone usage control group (SUC) and the smartphone usage disorder addiction group (SUD). Results: The background smartphone monitoring app of the proposed system successfully monitored the smartphone usage based on the developed algorithm. The usage minutes of the SUD were higher than the usage minutes of the SUC in 11 of the 16 categories developed in our study. Via the MindsCare PC app, the data were successfully integrated and stored, and managers can successfully analyze and diagnose based on the monitored data.

Usually single mixture has limitation and some have contrasting influences on properties of concrete. The combination of more kinds of mineral admixtures is postulated to improve concrete properties. Since RHA is highly reactive pozzolan, it has led to the idea of focusing the study on the performance of Multiblended pozzolan as partial cement replacement in mortar. Over 8 different mixes were produced in which four mixes contained varying percentages of admixtures (Multi Blended Cement, MBC) and the remainders were single mix (Binary Blended Cement, BBC) containing optimum percentages (based on literature study) of 20 % PFA, 20 % RHA, 50 % SLAG, and 10 % POFA. Three samples for each mix, curing period and parameter tests were prepared. This work initially deals with compressive strength characteristics, water absorption, and total porosity on mortar cured (standard curing) for 7, 28, 60 and 90 days. The performance of optimum MBC mortar was studied in terms of ultimate compressive strength, water absorption and total porosity. The strength properties of the optimum mixes of MBC mortars was also examined at different curing regimes. This research also focuses on studying some durability aspects of the optimum mix of MBC mortars namely acid attack, and carbonation. Besides, the effects of saline seawater were investigated for short term exposure. Finally attempt in brief study on suitability of the optimum mixes of MBC mortars as face sheets to produce lightweight non-load bearing sandwich block was conducted. From the results obtained, {{it was found that the}} strength of control and BBC mortars at early age on average were 20 % higher than MBC mortars, and at final age both were comparable with MBC mortars. The strength of all mortars at 90 days on average was 59 MPa. However, the MBC system produced low permeability mortar compared to control, and BBC mortars at all ages. The total porosity and water absorption of control and BBC were 28 % and 21 %, and 9 % and 14 %, respectively. The strength of MBC mortar after 45 cycles of wet and dry curing in seawater exhibited 24 % higher than control mortar.

More than one thousand specimens comprising cubes (70. 6 x 70. 6 x 70. 6 mm), panels (540 x 250 x 25 mm), mortar bars (25 x 25 x 250 mm) and prisms (40 x 40 x 160 mm), (40 x 40 x 50 mm) and (225 x 225 x 25 mm), plates (650 x 100 mm) and (885 x 270 x 25 mm) have been tested in this study. The influences of POFA with numerous replacement level and mixing constituents on compressive strength of aerated concrete have been investigated. The effects of curing methods on the compressive and flexural strengths of the specimens up to one year are also studied. Studies on the durability aspect of the mix are conducted to investigate its acid resistance, sulphate resistance, performance in sea water, carbonation, dimensional stability, as well as fire resistance. POFA aerated concrete is then used to produce panels for the investigation of their compressive strength. The experiments reveal that <b>continuous</b> water <b>curing</b> is the best method in assisting POFA aerated concrete for a higher strength than the ordinary Portland cement (OPC). A constant presence of moisture is significant for the strength development of POFA aerated concrete since pozzolanic reaction can only take place at the later age, after calcium hydroxide is available from the hydration. Utilization of POFA in aerated concrete improves the durability of the lightweight concrete when exposed to aggressive environment, such as acid, sulphate and sea water. The weight loss for OPC specimen is 3. 94 % from its original weight as compared to POFA aerated concrete which lost only 0. 9 % when immersed in hydrochloric acid solution for 1800 hours. Upon exposure to 10 % sodium sulphate solution, OPC mortar bar exhibit map cracks and expand as much as 14 times higher than POFA specimen. Besides that, POFA specimens also demonstrate higher durability to sea water when it exhibits lower strength reduction compared to plain aerated concrete after an exposure to marine environment for one year. The non combustible characteristic of this product and a very low influence on fire growth fulfills the requirement of the highest Class 0 under Clause 204 A in Building By-Law (1984). Finally, the study shows that POFA aerated concrete mix can be used to produce panels with adequate x 25 strength as non load-bearing element in construction...|$|R
30|$|Because of {{the cost}} of {{large-scale}} trials, a step-wise approach to consider potential problems and feasibility is desirable. An initial pilot study before proceeding with a larger multicenter trial is beneficial. In this regard, the Beta-lactam Infusion Group’s feasibility study (BLING I) has now led to the design of large clinical outcome study, BLING II. BLING I (Dulhunty et al., unpublished results; ACTRN 12610000238077) was a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, double dummy, pilot, randomized, controlled trial enrolling 60 critically ill patients from 5 ICUs across Australia and Hong Kong. The primary endpoint {{of the study was to}} establish the PK separation between CI and IB in terms of achieving plasma antibiotic concentrations above the MIC of causative pathogens. The PK findings in BLING I demonstrated significant differences in plasma antibiotic concentrations above MIC favoring the CI group (CI; 81.8 % vs. IB; 28.6 %, p[*]=[*] 0.001), thus supporting the notion of PK/PD superiority associated with <b>continuous</b> administration. Clinical <b>cure</b> also was superior in the CI group (CI; 70.0 % vs. IB; 43.3 %, p[*]=[*] 0.037). Other relevant findings include the feasibility of the proposed randomization and blinding process used by the BLING I investigators and the suggestion of appropriate surrogate endpoints for survival to be utilized in a multicenter study. Thus, based on the findings from BLING I, BLING II was designed with rigorous and stringent methods to answer the ultimate question of whether administration of beta-lactam antibiotics by CI will result in improved outcomes for patients with severe sepsis. BLING II is a phase II, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial that will recruit critically ill patients with severe sepsis in several ICUs in New Zealand as well as Australia and Hong Kong. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)-funded clinical trial aims to compare the effects of two approaches to the administration of beta-lactam antibiotics (i.e., CI vs. IB) on ICU-free days up to day 28.|$|R
40|$|Objectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of light-curing protocol on softening and elution of monomers in ethanol as measured on a model polymer. It was a further aim to correlate the measured values with previously reported data on degree of conversion and glass transition temperature for the same polymer and curing protocols. Methods. Different light-curing protocols were used in order to investigate the influence of energy density, power density, and mode of cure on the properties of a model polymer. The modes of <b>cure</b> were <b>continuous,</b> pulse-delay, and stepped irradiation of the specimens. Wallace hardness was used to determine the softening of the polymer after storage in ethanol for 24 h. Elution of monomers from the polymer was assessed after 7 days in ethanol by means of high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Data were submitted to two- and three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Newman-Keuls' multiple comparison test, and linear regression analysis. Results. Energy density, power density, and mode of cure of the polymer influenced the softening and elution of monomers in ethanol. As energy density increased, softening and elution in ethanol decreased. At same energy density, the influence of power density varied with the mode of cure. When compared to the <b>continuous</b> mode of <b>cure,</b> and at same energy density, pulse-delay irradiation resulted in polymers that in general were more susceptible to softening, but eluted monomers to a lower extent. Less elution was also found with step-cured polymers. Significant, negative correlations were detected between softening and elution in ethanol, respectively, and degree of conversion and between softening and elution in ethanol, respectively, and glass transition temperature. Significance. A complex relationship exists between curing protocol and the properties selected for investigation. The effect of different combinations of exposure periods and power densities are important to understanding how the curing protocol affects the properties of polymer-based materials.

40|$|Diaphragm {{walls are}} {{potentially}} ideal retaining walls for deep excavations in densely built-up areas, as they cause no vibrations during their construction and provide structural elements with high strength and stiffness. In the recent past, however, several projects using diaphragm walls as {{soil and water}} retaining elements have encountered severe problems. The problems primarily arise around the joints between panels. After excavation of the building pit, the joints slowly or suddenly start to leak. If a leak coincides with a permeable soil layer outside the building pit, the soil can erode, causing settlements adjacent to the retaining wall. An average 16 % chance of leakage per project has been estimated from previous projects, making {{the chance of a}} calamity due to a leaking joint unacceptably high for current litigious society. Detection techniques have traditionally focused on groundwater flow, as groundwater flow through the wall is an important link in the calamity chain: no groundwater flow: no transportation of soil: no settlements. The flaw in such a detection system {{is the nature of the}} anomalies in diaphragm walls. Due to the production procedure of diaphragm walls, anomalies in most cases consist of bentonite (clay) pockets in the joint. These clayey anomalies have a high hydraulic resistivity, making them almost impossible to detect based upon the groundwater flow detection principle. After excavation and thus exposing the anomaly, the clayey material is too weak to retain the groundwater pressure, causing a leak which can quickly erode the remaining material in the anomaly. In contrast with the above mentioned detection principle, this research has primarily focused on the quality of concrete around the joints between the diaphragm wall panels. It is assumed that when persistent high quality concrete in the joint area is present, no leakage or soil transport through the wall can take place. Based on the physical characteristics of concrete, soil and bentonite slurry, several measurement techniques have been chosen for examination in the laboratory and in the field. Using the test results from pilot projects, three techniques have been chosen for further validation and, if possible, cross correlation with the other techniques and the actual shape of the anomalies. The validated techniques are (in order of effectiveness in a project setting) : Crosshole Sonic Logging (CSL), Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and Electrical Resistivity (ER). The effectiveness of all three methods has been based upon the cost of the measurements, the accuracy of the interpretation, the ease of interpretation and the interference with the production process. CSL is commonly used in large diameter bored pile integrity testing and is based upon the sound velocity in a medium. The velocity is determined by the stiffness and density of the material. For concrete these parameters are relatively high compared to the characteristics of the material that is expected to be present in an anomaly (soil or bentonite). An increase in the observed travel time of the ultrasonic signal indicates an anomaly. The simultaneously observed attenuation of the signal offers additional information about the properties of the anomaly. In this study the CSL technique has been verified for the novel application investigating the joints between diaphragm walls. This research has shown that the ultrasonic signal of current CSL devices can pass the joint between diaphragm wall panels while remaining interpretable. With the reference measurements of this study showing linear correlation between delay in arrival time and anomaly width, the size and material of an anomaly can be estimated, making preemptive repair decisions possible. DTS is generally accepted in diverse monitoring applications such as monitoring power lines, hydrological flow patterns, concrete curing temperature distribution and down-hole oil production parameters. The technique uses optical fiber sensors that provide a continuous temperature profile along the length of the fiber when read out by a DTS device. In this study the DTS technique has been validated for application during diaphragm wall production. The spatial resolution for tracing a progressing temperature front has been determined. This resolution is an order of magnitude better than suggested by the specifications of the measurement equipment. With the appropriate processing of the recorded temperature profiles in the time domain, the bentonite refreshing and concrete casting processes can be monitored meticulously. During bentonite refreshing, the temperature of the freshly mixed slurry should ideally show up at all depths of each recorded profile (positioned at critical locations in the trench e. g. in the joints). If locally the arrival of fresh slurry is not observed, the refreshing process can be repeated after additional clean-up of the trench. This ensures consistent slurry characteristics before concrete casting takes place. During concrete casting, the interpreted DTS recordings will show the casting progress in time for each DTS profile position. The observed temperatures also reveal valuable information about the purity of the concrete, making an estimate of the local concrete quality possible. Electrical resistivity methods are often mentioned as a possibility for detecting leaks. The method is based upon differences in electrical resistivity of soil and concrete. It is assumed that a <b>continuous</b> (fully <b>cured)</b> concrete wall will have a relatively high resistivity compared to a wall with clayey anomalies. In this study the method has been tested for detecting anomalies in diaphragm walls. Detection limits for several electrode configurations have been determined. From the test results, requirements for field tests have been derived. To obtain adequate measurements, at least a four electrode setup must be used with the potential electrodes placed no further than 0. 2 m from the diaphragm wall. The research comprised laboratory and site testing in several projects. The project experiences are an important component of this research, as they illustrate the practical implications of the measurement techniques. As a result, it was possible to derive a manual for the execution of the measurements, containing practical tips for the interpretation of the measurement results. CSL is the primary recommended method because of the relatively low cost, low impact on the building process and reliable and fast interpretation. DTS shows great potential for a step forward in quality control during diaphragm wall production. Currently, the method will be beneficial for verifying concrete flow in pilot panels with rebar spacing beyond the design code requirements. The still relatively high cost of data acquisition and interpretation (about 100 % of one panel building cost) limit large scale application. Electrical resistivity has been least successful in determining anomalies in diaphragm walls. In specific circumstances, the method could provide useful information, especially if other methods have not been applied and preemptive repair of the diaphragm wall with jetgrout poses a risk to the surroundings. Due to the data acquisition time and space requirement, this method is more costly than the other methods. Geoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
