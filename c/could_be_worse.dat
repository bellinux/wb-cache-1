The reviewer expressed bemusement at [...] "Terrorists with robots and plasma guns" [...] antagonists, but reflected – in reference to Cannon Fodder 2 – [...] "Still, <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>worse.</b> They could be time-travelling aliens again." [...] He said the [...] "biggest issue" [...] is that a [...] "gung-ho" [...] approach to play is infeasible and that the [...] "precise and tactical" [...] approach faithful to earlier games in the series [...] "turns {{out to be a}} very different experience from before. Far less satisfying". This is due to the [...] "key problem" [...] of the ease with which enemy weapons such as rocket launcher-armed turrets can destroy the player's soldiers. The player is thus forced [...] "to play with aching, paranoid care, picking away at base defences from as far away as possible, and rubbing up against the save points like a lovely cat finally reunited with its owner. This is not fun." [...] He also complained about the arbitrary death inflicted by exploding barrels [...] "raining down over the entire screen." [...] Cobbet summarised that the departure from the original game meant that Cannon Fodder 3 did not evoke nostalgia and was a [...] "poor substitute" [...] for other action or strategy games. On the other hand, he found the game [...] "admittedly nowhere near as frustrating" [...] as the original. He reflected that it [...] "does have a solid crack at updating the action for a new age, and it's far from as bad as expected" [...] given its obscure development.|$|E

2500|$|Summers had {{previously}} {{argued that a}} proposed boycott was antisemitic [...] "in effect, if not intent". This position was criticized by Judith Butler, in an article titled [...] "No, it's not anti-semitic". Butler argues the distinction of effective antisemitism, and intentional antisemitism is at best controversial. [...] "If we think that to criticise Israeli violence, or to call for economic pressure {{to be put on}} the Israeli state to change its policies, is to be ‘effectively anti-semitic’, we will fail to voice our opposition for fear of being named as part of an anti-semitic enterprise. No label <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>worse</b> for a Jew, who knows that, ethically and politically, the position with which it would be unbearable to identify is that of the anti-semite." ...|$|E

[...] Green's fellow reviewer, Helen Elliott, felt Just Like That (1994) showed that [...] "The joke, and the entire seriousness of this brilliant novel, lies in the way Brett has turned the anguish of generations into art... has created an unusually lovely woman , full of laughter, torn with anxiety, capable of malice and brimming with love." ...|$|E

Butterfield Hiking Trail is named for the Butterfield Stage Line that passed through Arkansas. was a stagecoach route in the United States, operating from 1857 to 1861. It was a route for the United States mail from two eastern termini, Memphis, Tennessee and St. Louis, Missouri, meeting Fort Smith, Arkansas, and continuing through Indian Territory, New Mexico, and Arizona, ending in San Francisco, California. A writer for the New York Herald, Waterman L. Ornsby, described the Butterfield trail as it passed through the Boston Mountains.

2500|$|The case {{failed because}} of lack of proper {{evidence}} thanks to Jatin's policy of a loose decentralised organisation federating scores of regional units, as observed by F.C. Daly more than once: [...] "The gang is a heterogeneous one, with several advisers and petty chiefs... From information we have on record we may divide the gang into four parts: (1) Gurus, (2) Influential supporters, (3) Leaders, (4) Members." [...] J.C. Nixon's report is more explicit : [...] "Although a separate name and a separate individuality have been given to these various parties in this account of them, and although such a distinction was probably observed amongst the minor members, it is very clear that the bigger figures were in close communication with one another and were frequently accepted members of two or more of these samitis. It may be taken that at some time these various parties were engaged in anarchical crime independently, although in their revolutionary aims and usually in their origins they were all very closely related." [...] Several observers pinpointed Jatin so accurately that the newly appointed Viceroy Lord Hardinge wrote more explicitly to Earl Crewe (H.M.'s Secretary of State for India): [...] "As regards prosecution, I (...) deprecate the net being thrown so wide; as for example in the Howrah Gang Case, where 47 persons are being prosecuted, of whom only one is, I believe, the real criminal. If a concentrated effort had been made to convict this one criminal, I think it would have had a better effect than the prosecution of 46 misguided youths." [...] On 28 May 1911, Hardinge recognised : [...] "The 10th Jats case was {{part and parcel of the}} Howrah Gang Case; and with the failure in the latter, the Government of Bengal realised the futility of proceeding with the former...
