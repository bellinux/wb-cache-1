In another scene, the fire on her palms vanishes as she <b>clasps</b> her hands. Flames later engulf Eminem and the couple, who are then shown fighting in front of the burning house. In the end, the couple stays together and the video returns to their first scene, in which they sleep.|$|E

At six loops, the <b>clasp</b> changes to silver, and then at eleven loops the <b>clasp</b> changes to gold. Thus, a silver <b>clasp</b> with two loops would denote the seventh award of the Good Conduct Medal while a gold <b>clasp</b> with five loops would indicate the fifteenth award of the Good Conduct Medal, which is the highest that the regulations list.|$|R

Haakon casts himself down before her a second time, and Sigmund notices that Haakon is weeping. He stands up again, {{takes hold of}} the ring, and finds {{that it has become}} loose. Haakon gives the ring to Sigmund, and tells him that he must never part with it. Sigmund gives him his word on it and the men part, each returning to their ships. A storm appears and the two ships are swept apart, and many days are described as passing afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Early {{examples}} of Anglo-Saxon art are largely metalwork, particularly bracelets, <b>clasps</b> and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional {{items such as}} the intricately carved whalebone Franks Casket, {{thought to have been}} produced in Northumbria in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs. There is only one known pagan burial in Scotland, at Dalmeny Midlothian, which contains a necklace of beads similar to those found in mid-seventh-century southern England. Other isolated finds include a gold object from Dalmeny, shaped like a truncated pyramid, with filigree and garnet, similar to sword harness mounts found at Sutton Hoo. There is also a bun-shaped loom from Yetholm, Roxburghshire and a ring with an Anglian runic inscription. From eastern Scotland there is a seventh-century sword pommel from Culbin Sands, Moray and the Burghead drinking horn mount. After Christianisation in the seventh century artistic styles in Northumbria, which then reached to the Firth of Forth, interacted with those in Ireland and what is now Scotland {{to become part of the}} common style historians have identified as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon.|$|E
5|$|He briefly {{commanded}} the regimental depot, {{before returning to}} the peninsula in 1811 as General Thomas Picton's aide-de-camp, and later assistant adjutant-general (AAG) to Picton's 3rd Division, he received a majority by brevet on 28 April 1812, and a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy on 26 August 1813. He held the position of AAG {{until the end of the}} Peninsular War in 1814, and received the Gold Cross with two <b>clasps</b> for his services. When an amphibious force was sent to North America in 1814 during the War of 1812, Stovin was appointed its deputy adjutant-general; he was wounded at the Battle of New Orleans. He prosecuted the case of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Mullins when the force returned to the United Kingdom—Mullins, commanding the 44th Foot, had been charged with neglecting orders during the battle. As a result, although he had been assigned to Picton's staff, he missed the opportunity to serve with him in the Waterloo Campaign.|$|E

40|$|Male Xenopus laevis frogs {{have been}} {{observed}} to <b>clasp</b> other males in a sustained, amplectant position, the purpose of which is unknown. We examined three possible hypotheses for this counter-intuitive behavior: 1) <b>clasping</b> males fail to discriminate {{the sex of the}} frogs they clasp; 2) male-male <b>clasping</b> is an aggressive or dominant behavior; or 3) that males <b>clasp</b> other males to gain proximity to breeding events and possibly engage in sperm competition. Our data, gathered through a series of behavioral experiments in the laboratory, refute the first two hypotheses. We found that males did not <b>clasp</b> indiscriminately, but showed a sex preference, with most males preferentially <b>clasping</b> a female, but a proportion preferentially <b>clasping</b> another male. Males that <b>clasped</b> another male when there was no female present were less likely to "win" reproductive access in a male-male-female triad, indicating that they did not establish dominance through <b>clasping.</b> However, those males did gain proximity to oviposition by continued male-male <b>clasping</b> {{in the presence of the}} female. Thus, our findings are consistent with, but cannot confirm, the third hypothesis of male-male <b>clasping</b> as an alternative reproductive tactic...|$|R

5|$|Male adults may patrol individually, {{but most}} congregate in swarms a few metres above water with clear open sky above it, and perform a nuptial (courtship) dance. Each insect has a {{characteristic}} up-and-down pattern of movement; strong wingbeats propel it upwards and forwards with the tail sloping down; when it stops moving its wings, it falls passively with the abdomen tilted upwards. Females fly into these swarms, and mating {{takes place in}} the air. A rising male <b>clasps</b> the thorax of a female from below using his front legs bent upwards, and inseminates her. Copulation may last just a few seconds, but occasionally a pair remains in tandem and flutters to the ground. Males may spend the night in vegetation and return to the nuptial dance the following day. Although they do not feed, some briefly touch the surface to drink a little water before flying off.|$|E
5|$|Most {{art historians}} {{believe that there}} are a number of {{indicators}} that the panel was the left-hand wing of a dismantled diptych. The frame contains <b>clasps,</b> implying it was once hinged to a second panel. The work seems composed to be symmetrically balanced towards an accompanying right-hand wing: Mary is positioned slightly to the right of centre, while her downward, almost coy glance is directed at a space beyond the edge of the panel, suggesting that she is looking at, or in the direction of, a kneeling donor in a right-hand wing. The visible architectural features – with the exception of the niches, the crucifixion and the windows directly behind it, which are at a right angle to the nave and centre front, facing the viewer – are at the left of the panel, facing right.|$|E
5|$|The last {{mentioned}} specimen {{comes from}} the Olsztyn group burial ground in Tumiany. The Olsztyn group represents the late phase of the Western Baltic cultural circle, with the beginnings {{in the second half}} of the 5th century and the developed stages in 6th and 7th centuries. It was located in Masuria, partially in areas vacated by the Wielbark culture people. The group is believed to have been established by branches of the Galindians tribe, including a part of it that migrated to southern Europe and then returned to the Baltic area. The Olsztyn group cemeteries contain horse burials and many sophisticated style plate <b>clasps,</b> buckles, connectors and other objects made of bronze, silver and gold, studded with semi-precious stones and decorated with engravings, which demonstrate its people's extensive interregional and far reaching trade and other relationships and contacts, that included Scandinavia, western, southern and southeastern Europe.|$|E
40|$|To {{compare the}} {{gastroesophageal}} junction {{of the human}} with the pig, M 2 and M 3 receptor densities and the potencies of M 2 and M 3 muscarinic receptor subtype selective antagonists were determined in gastric <b>clasp</b> and sling smooth muscle fibers. Total muscarinic and M 2 receptors are higher in pig than human <b>clasp</b> and sling fibers. M 3 receptors are higher in human compared with pig sling fibers but lower in human compared with pig <b>clasp</b> fibers. <b>Clasp</b> fibers have fewer M 3 receptors than sling fibers in both humans and pigs. Similar to human <b>clasp</b> fibers, pig <b>clasp</b> fibers contract significantly less than pig sling fibers. Analysis of the methoctramine Schild plot suggests that M 2 receptors are involved in mediating contraction in pig <b>clasp</b> and sling fibers. Darifenacin potency suggests that M 3 receptors mediate contraction in pig sling fibers and that M 2 and M 3 receptors mediate contraction in pig <b>clasp</b> fibers. Taken together, the data suggest that both M 2 and M 3 muscarinic receptors mediate the contraction in both pig <b>clasp</b> and sling fibers similar to human <b>clasp</b> and sling fibers...|$|R

5|$|Only {{fragments}} of artifacts survive from the Brythonic speaking kingdoms of southern Scotland. Pictish {{art can be}} seen in the extensive survival of carved Pictish stones, particularly in the north and east of the country. These display a variety of recurring images and patterns, as at Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno (Angus). There are a few survivals of Pictish silver, notably a number of massive neck-chains including the Whitecleuch Chain, and also the unique silver plaques from the cairn at Norrie's Law. Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of Dál Riata is much more difficult to identify, but may include items such as the Hunterston brooch, which with other items such as the Monymusk Reliquary, suggest that Dál Riata was one of the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed. Early examples of Anglo-Saxon art include metalwork, particularly bracelets, <b>clasps</b> and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional items such as the intricately carved whalebone Franks Casket, thought to have been produced in Northumbria in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs. After the Christian conversion of what is now Scotland in the seventh century, artistic styles in Northumbria interacted with those in Ireland and Scotland to become part of the common style historians have identified as insular or Hiberno-Saxon.|$|E
5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{populations were}} {{for the most part}} also moving (to a lesser extent) south and east, which by the 4th century caused a {{lessening}} of the population density in northern and central Poland with a simultaneous settlement concentration increases in Lesser Poland and Silesia. The Przeworsk people there {{at this point in time}} are often identified with the Vandals Germanic tribe. The 4th and 5th century Przeworsk societies had to cope with a deterioration of their traditional tribal social structure, caused by the accumulation of wealth and influence in the hands of the rich, the warriors, the tribal elders and rulers, who controlled the trade, imposed contributions and plundered. During these two centuries the number of the Przeworsk culture settlements and cemeteries generally decreases. There are also clear signs of the environment being overly exploited, which provided another motivation for the population to gradually leave. Most burials were getting more poorly equipped, in comparison with the previous periods. Late Przeworsk culture ceramic materials from Greater Poland show impoverishment and lack of differentiation of form, but on the other hand metal 5th century <b>clasps,</b> found at a variety of locations from eastern Lesser Poland, through eastern Greater Poland to Kujawy, demonstrate the usual for mature Germanic societies highest quality of workmanship.|$|E

Singing the first verse, she {{witnesses}} a depressing scene of her brother quarreling with her sister who are scolded by their mother. She slowly <b>clasps</b> both her hands before the video shifts to the present day where Clarkson is seen arriving on the red carpet with her publicist for the world premiere of The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. After posing for the photographers, she enters the cinema and watches the film. The next scene switches back to the younger Clarkson who is sitting and looking around her neighborhood at her house's rooftop as a plane is seen flying across the sky. The video switches back to the older Clarkson who is now watching the aforementioned film in her laptop inside the plane as it goes through a mild turbulence. Clarkson is also seen reminiscing about her past job as a worker in a movie theater, singing with her co-workers.

5|$|Decorating of the Bride {{is one of}} Jovanović's Orientalist works, notable {{examples}} of which include The Wounded Montenegrin (1882), Fencing Lesson (1883) and Cockfight (1897). The painting is undated, and it remains unknown exactly when it was composed. Petar Petrović, the curator of the National Museum of Serbia, dates it to ca. 1885–86. Art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson writes that it was painted in 1888. What is known for certain is that Jovanović painted it in the mid-1880s {{on one of his}} travels through the Balkans. One source contends that it was composed while the artist was visiting the Ottoman town of Shkodër, in present-day Albania. Another version of the painting {{is said to have been}} created by the artist not long after the original, but is considered lost. An 1891 journal article describes this version as depicting two women decorating the bride, while to her left the bride's mother <b>clasps</b> her hands and cries with joy. This version is said to have shown a girl on the verge of tears standing by a door to the far left. On the right, a woman and young girl could be seen offering gifts to the bride. During conservatory examinations in 2009, it was discovered that Decorating of the Bride had been painted over a similar, earlier work. The artist appears to have shortened the right side of the canvas by about , altered the appearance of the interior, and slightly modified the left side of the painting. Save for the shortened canvas length, the right side of the painting is identical to that in the final version.|$|E

40|$|SummaryCLASP {{is a key}} {{regulator}} of microtubule (MT) {{dynamics and}} bipolar mitotic spindle structure with <b>CLASP</b> mutants displaying a distinctive monopolar spindle phenotype. It has been postulated that cryptic TOG domains underlie <b>CLASP’s</b> ability to regulate MT dynamics. Here, we report the crystal structure of a cryptic TOG domain (TOG 2) from human <b>CLASP</b> 1, demonstrating {{the presence of a}} TOG array in the <b>CLASP</b> family. Strikingly, <b>CLASP</b> 1 TOG 2 exhibits a convex architecture across the tubulin-binding surface that contrasts with the flat tubulin-binding surface of XMAP 215 family TOG domains. Mutations in key conserved TOG 2 determinants abrogate the ability of <b>CLASP</b> mutants to rescue bipolar spindle formation in Drosophila cells depleted of endogenous <b>CLASP.</b> These findings highlight the common mechanistic use of TOG domains in XMAP 215 and <b>CLASP</b> families to regulate MT dynamics and suggest that differential TOG domain architecture may confer distinct functions to these critical cytoskeletal regulators...|$|R
