Unfortunately, students take less and less physical activity devoting much more time to surfing the Internet. Aim: Determining the relationship between the degree of the Internet addition and the level of physical activity of primary school students and lower and upper secondary school students. Material and methods: The study covered 463 students in the fifth and sixth grades of primary schools and the second and third classes of lower and upper secondary schools. The research was carried out from February 2017 to April 2017 in schools in Lublin, Radom and nearby villages. The applied research method was a diagnostic survey, and tools: the Internet addiction test, Dr. Kimberly Young and the authors’ self-designed survey containing questions about physical activity. Results: Dr. Young test pointed out the addiction in 53 out of 463 tested pupils (11. 4 %). The dependence concerned 12 primary school students (7. 9 %), 26 lower secondary school students (16. 0 %) and 15 upper secondary school students (10. 0 %). In contrast, the risk of addiction occurred in 33 (7. 1 %) students. Moderate physical activity during the last week for a minimum of 10 minutes 88. 8 % of respondents declared. Conclusions: 	Internet addiction affects the level of physical activity. 	The least time for physical activity have those diagnosed with addiction. 	It is advisable to undertake educational and activative actions on the forms of leisure time for pupils at all stages of education.

40|$|One of the {{important}} questions in modern oncology is treatment of patients with early stages of {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). Adjuvant polychemotherapy (APCT) can help to improve prognosis after operation. In modern literature there is no unified opinion as for patients in need of adjuvant chemotherapy. However, now investigators indicate to necessity to use molecular markers for individualization of APCT. The aim of our study was to assess correlation between apoptos level in primary tumor in patients with early stages of NSCLC with effectiveness of APCT. Study was conducted by the <b>chair</b> <b>of</b> <b>oncology</b> of Zaporozhye state medical university since June 2008 to Dec 2012. 254 patients with I-II stages of non-small cell lung cancer were included in the study. Expres¬sion of p 53 was evaluated as percent of positively stained nucleus tumor cells in general population. More than 25 % of positively stained nucleus tumor cells meant high p 53 expression. Results: We performed assessment of apoptosis level with the help of p 53 expression in 220 patients. No prognostic significance of p 53 level expression in patients with early stages of non-small cell lung cancer (р= 0, 65) was revealed. There was significant correlation between age (р= 0, 039), sex (р= 0, 009) and apoptosis level in primary tumor in patients with early stages of NSCLC. Worse survival was noted in group of patients with low p 53 expressions after adjuvant chemotherapy (р= 0, 009). But in patients with high level of p 53 expression adjuvant chemotherapy significantly increased survival (p< 0, 001). So, adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with I-II stages of NSCLC is necessary to be carried out in cases of high p 53 expression level...|$|E

In spite of the number of studies available in the field there is still no consistent data regarding the issue of life satisfaction among nurses at this stage of life. The aim of the study was to explore chosen factors associated with the life satisfaction of Polish nurses at the retirement age. Methods: A quantitative approach was adopted. Data was collected using a survey questionnaire to be completed by 135 nurses (100 %) at the retirement age from seven randomly chosen District Chambers of Nurses and Midwives in Poland. Two research tools were used: a questionnaire developed by the authors and the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) by E. Diener. The collected data was analysed using STATISTICA version 10. 0. Results: Statistically significant variables affecting the level of life satisfaction included the type of professional activity, type of workplace and managerial functions served, and also affiliation with a given District Chamber of Nurses and Midwives. There was no significant correlation between the level of life satisfaction and the level of job satisfaction among the nurses surveyed. Conclusions: A correlation was identified between some elements of professional activity and the life satisfaction of nurses at the retirement age. This should be taken into account when considering different aspects of the organisation of nurses’ work. In the light of the changes of retirement schemes across the world a broader discussion is needed regarding the issue of the life satisfaction of nurses at the retirement age in order to study the possible correlations between their professional activity and satisfaction with life. Developing a clear strategy for planning the forms of activation of retired nurses and using their potential and experience in the healthcare system is recommended, especially given the situation of nurses shortage.

Abstract Breast cancer is the most frequent as well as, at the same time, most dangerous of cancers affecting women with regard to diagnosing it in the advanced stage being also characterised with the top degree of mortality of female patients worldwide. At present, it is the most frequent malignant tumour affecting Polish women [9]. Awareness of women about risk factors and the early diagnostic testing consisting in self-examination of breasts and also regular performance of mammographic examinations in the appropriate age may reduce, in the significant way, mortality amongst women affected with this illness by its early detecting and curing. This study is aimed at presenting the state of knowledge of women in the age of 50 - 69 concerned with risk factors of breast cancer and the frequency of performing prophylactic examinations by them...|$|E

Materials and methods: Twenty consecutive patients with histopathologically confirmed breast carcinoma stages T 1 –T 4, N 1 –N 2, who were treated with modified radical mastectomy with neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy underwent PFTs, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1), forced expiratory flow at 50 %, and peak expiratory flow rate, maximum mid expiratory flow (MMEF 25 – 75), maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max), and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) before, at 30 days, and at 90 days after locoregional PMRT. A two-tailed paired Student’s t-test {{was used to compare}} mean values among the variables between the groups Results: A significant drop in FVC, FEV 1, and DLCO was noticed at day 90 after the completion of locoregional PMRT with P-values 0. 033, 0. 042, and 0. 031, respectively, while MMEF 25 – 75 and VO 2 max were not significantly affected (P-values 0. 075 and 0. 062, respectively) favoring a restrictive lung injury pattern. However, no patient was found to be symptomatic. Conclusion: A significant drop in reduction in PFTs occurred at day 90 after the completion of locoregional PMRT.
