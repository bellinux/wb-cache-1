The data obtained allowed to validate a migration models on real foods both for compliance as worst case or refined for exposure assessment. The results also showed aspects of food chemistry that can influence migration, and initiated a new area of public risk perception specific to food contact materials safety. These systematic kinetics studies have a direct impact on Directive 85 / 572 /EC on correspondence factors of foodstuffs and food simulants; The results obtained also show an impact on 2002 / 72 /EC on allowing the use of mathematical modelling, a the data is used to validate the current diffusion model for further applications; in addition The project shows an impact on risk assessment from systematic kinetics of migration related to real foods in different conditions for exposure assessment (EFSA), as well on standardisation (CEN) from the development of methods in foodstuffs.

40|$|Instrumentation {{such as the}} Chemistry and Mineralogy {{instrument}} (CheMin) on {{the ongoing}} Mars Science Lab rover mission is able to gather information from a sample almost immediately upon collection on the Martian surface; however, detecting molecular signs of extinct and extant life, or 28 STAR <b>Closing</b> <b>Conference</b> biosignatures, at low concentrations may require equipment with an even greater level of sensitivity. The capability of detecting biomolecules with a confidence acceptable to the scientific community exists on Earth, and at {{the current state of}} these technologies, it would be extremely challenging to miniaturize all relevant instrumentation for flight. The gathering and return of samples from the surface of Mars is likely paramount in the identification and confirmation of biosignatures. Sample containers would be expected to not corrode on the Martian surface or interact with the samples, and a gap of knowledge exists in this area. There are two parts to this study. The first is potentiodynamic polarization testing of titanium, stainless steel 304, and nitonol (A titanium/nickel alloy used in a prototype container seal) used for corrosion characteristics in Halite, Magnesium Sulfate, Perchlorate, Potassium Chloride, Hematite, MRS (a sulfate mixture), and Sulfuric and Hydrochloric Acid. Potentiodynamic polarization testing accelerates the corrosion process by applying a potential to the material of interest. The second is analysis of organic interactions with metals and substrates listed above by subjecting known quantities of organics placed on coupons to potentiodynamic polarization tests, then recovering the organics and comparing the results. All metals tested are interpreted to have very low corrosion levels in all substrates. The organics results should be a significant determinant of which metal to use considering container construction for future Mars caching and sample return missions...|$|E

A <b>closing</b> <b>conference</b> for the projects will be held at Dokkhuset on the 3 rd and 4 th of September and will include artist talks by the exhibiting artists. At Babel Christina Lammer presents two video installations. Mirror Mirror (2014) where a young facially paralyzed girl performs her exercises at home in front of the mirror. She is already several years after nerve and muscle transplantation. Hand Movie 0 (2012) is part of a video series that was produced in the operating theatre of plastic and reconstructive surgery where the artist explores gestures of surgeons. With her camera she follows touching moments of surgical treatment and illuminates aesthetic and particularly empathetic aspects in the operating field. Andrew Carnie’s installation Magic Forest is a dreamlike journey through a growing brain’s development and its organizing of neurons. Based on scientific results, 162 slides show how neurons expand into a shape resembling trees and other organic material. The installation was made after a collaboration with neuroscientists at Kings College and was presented at the Science Museum in London in 2002. Andrew Carnie works visually with pictures of the brain and neurons both in painting and larger installations. He is a well-known artist and academic working closely with scientists and research results. Carnie lives and works in Winchester and London as an artist and lecturer.

40|$|The Royal College of Art {{is proud}} to host the TRADERS project’s <b>closing</b> <b>conference</b> ‘MEDIATIONS - Art & Design Agency and Participation in Public Space’. The notion of citizen {{participation}} has (re) gained momentum over the last decade, both {{in the realm of}} national and local politics – partly driven by advances in digital technologies such as civic platforms – as well as outside the institutional domain. Several art and design practitioners have embraced this participatory turn, aiming to empower citizens to reclaim agency in the public realm. At the same time, various (conceptual) models of participatory democracy have been explored through numerous political theories 1. There are, however, still very few theories that mediate between such conceptual models and actual participatory art and/ or design practices in a meaningful and rigorous way [i]. The TRADERS 2 project, and the MEDIATIONS conference as an extension of it, aims to operate within this ambiguous territory. TRADERS focuses on enabling an exchange of experiences and knowledge in the field of participation in art and design. Working collectively and individually through workshops, performances, exhibitions and publications, six early-career researchers have explored different approaches including intervention, mapping, data mining, play, dialogue and curating. While these six research projects vary in their thematic approach and deploy different art and design-based research methods, they all contribute to a collective deconstruction and problematisation of the notion of citizen participation in art and design, particularly within the context of public space. Conversely, public space serves as a valuable context and pedagogic tool to develop critical awareness in art and design. As such this conference (re) connects with historic reflections on art and design education held in July 1968 by the ‘Movement for Re-Thinking Art and Design Education’ (MORADE) in London’s Roundhouse, where contributors - drawn almost equally from staff and students of art colleges - tackled the recurrent theme of the relationship of ‘Art’ to ‘Society’. Calls for abolition of decrepit authority in the microcosm of those schools lead to a turning point in design education in 1968, when staff joined students in occupying art schools at Hornsey (north London) and Guildford (south London) ...|$|E
40|$|In January 2002, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{received}} {{a request for}} a Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, New York City Transit (MTA-NYCT) from representatives of the Transport Workers Union (TWU), Local 100. The Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU), Local 726, later asked to be included in this HHE. The HHE request cited concerns about respiratory and mental health symptoms among MTA employees subsequent to the September 11 World Trade Center (WTC) attack. Employees believed exposure to the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks caused these symptoms. In response, NIOSH investigators conducted meetings between MTA-NYCT management and union representatives to prepare for a study to evaluate worker concerns. The initial site visit included an opening conference, a walk-through evaluation of three subway train stations near the WTC, and a <b>closing</b> <b>conference.</b> During the week of April 30, 2002, NIOSH investigators administered questionnaires to 269 MTA employees. This self-administered questionnaire contained questions about demographics, past medical history, smoking history, work duties and location, WTC-related activities performed, and symptoms occurring on and after September 11. Questionnaire data analysis showed that workers in the dust cloud {{at the time of the}} WTC collapse had significantly higher risk of persistent lower respiratory symptoms (OR= 9. 85; 95 % CI: 2. 24, 58. 93), persistent mucous membrane symptoms (OR= 4. 91; 95 % CI: 1. 53, 16. 22), depressive symptoms (OR= 2. 48; 95 % CI: 1. 12, 5. 51), and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms (OR= 2. 91; 95 % CI: 1. 003, 8. 16) compared to those not exposed to the dust cloud. Based on these data, we conclude that clinical follow up for physical and psychological health conditions should be provided for affected public transportation workers subsequent to a catastrophic event. NIOSH sent an interim letter including preliminary results to MTA and union officials on December 17, 2002. This report describes our final results, analyses, conclusions, and recommendations. NIOSH investigators determined that NYC transit workers exposed to the dust cloud at the time of the September 11, 2001, WTC collapse had significantly higher risk of persistent lower respiratory and mucous membrane symptoms, and depressive and PTSD symptoms 7 - 1 / 2 months later compared to those not exposed to the dust cloud. Clinical follow up of affected transit workers for physical and psychological conditions should be continued through existing federal programs.
