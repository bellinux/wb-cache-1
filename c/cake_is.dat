5|$|The player {{starts the}} game with three lives. Several {{ingredients}} will fly around the screen simultaneously, and if the player touches an ingredient with their body, a life will be deducted. The player's objective {{is to put the}} ingredients into the cooking bowl before they either fall into the dustbins on either side or knock the player into the bowl. As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will push the ingredients further in the direction they are moving in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player to push the ingredients further than conventional flour sacks. The player has to push the right variety of ingredients into the bowl, which changes for each level. When the right amount of ingredients has been put in the bowl, a <b>cake</b> <b>is</b> baked and a new level begins.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The use {{of biomass}} for fuel {{required}} {{understanding of its}} chemical nature and thermal characteristic for maximum and effective utilisation, thus seed cakes of Lagenaria vulgaris, Lagenaria ladle and Cucurbita pepo were analyzed for their thermal and chemical properties. The thermal behaviour of the <b>cakes</b> <b>was</b> determined using thermo-gravimetric method and proximate compositions of the <b>cakes</b> <b>were</b> deduced from the thermogram. The percentage of fixed carbon (FC) were {{within the range of}} 22. 534 and 37. 009 %, while volatile matter of the <b>cakes</b> <b>were</b> 57. 758 % for Lagenaria ladle, 56. 303 % for Lagenaria vulgaris and 54. 882 % for C. pepo. Major organic elements in the <b>cakes</b> <b>were</b> measured using CHNS- 923 elemental analyzer. Calorific values and oxygen required for the combustion of the <b>cakes</b> <b>were</b> quantified using bomb calorimeter and stoichiometric equation respectively. The results showed the co-firing potential of the cakes in furnaces and boilers as well as their potentiality of being viable feedstock for biogas production...|$|R
