The rings are very light, and are designed to have no adverse effect on the birds – indeed, the whole basis of using ringing to gain data about the birds is that ringed birds should behave in all respects {{in the same way as}} the unringed population. The birds so tagged can then be identified when they are re-trapped, or found dead, later.|$|E

2500|$|The Union Mutual Life Insurance Company didn't {{like the}} {{publicity}} linking their company with Chase's publicity for the religion, and transferred him to Los Angeles. Stockman says [...] "Chase considered resigning from the company, {{but at the}} age of sixty-two he found it impossible to obtain another job, and he had to support his wife, his son in college, and his elderly mother-in-law, none of whom had become Bahá’í." [...] Chase still traveled for the religion. Indeed he reached Victoria, British Colombia in 1909. In 1910 a talk entitled as his introductory book was offered in Los Angeles. In 1911 Chase spoke to a public meeting of the religion in Portland, Oregon. He helped to organize the Los Angeles Bahá'ís; in 1910 they elected a five-member governing board that included Chase as a member, which then included a majority of women, with a general community of some 30 people. They also established their first monthly meetings. Though he could not attend the national convention of Bahá'ís in 1910 he did send a letter. In 1911 he was listed as the <b>contact</b> <b>address</b> for the assembly, participated in attempts by the community to coordinate internationally, and was credited with assisting to organize the Denver Bahá'í Assembly along with Corinne True. That summer Chase received a copy of the proceedings of the First Universal Races Congress to which `Abdu'l-Bahá had sent a representative with a message. Chase observed a distinction between `Abdu'l-Bahá's message of promoting spiritual unity as a higher calling than that of simply recognizing partisanship among nations vying for priority or advocacy of a race and stressed that the transformation of the time required accepting the influences of the [...] "new heaven". In November he summarized the presence of the religion in California for the first major Bahá'í periodical of the country, Star of the West, noting excitement in San Francisco because of the visit of Dr. Fareed and Lua Getsinger in advance of `Abdu'l-Bahá coming west, regular meetings in Los Angeles as well, and the hospitality provided by Mrs. Goodall and Cooper in Oakland. In May 1912 Chase was present at garden party observance of Ridván in San Francisco. The San Francisco Assembly had been founded in 1910. Stockman observed circa 1990 that Chase used to include mention of how many Bahá'í there were {{in the early days of}} the religion in his letters to people in a period well before the first accounting done inside the religion.|$|E
