50|$|Essar Oil {{reported}} {{commercial production}} of 10.5mtpa in May 2008.The units commissioned {{in the first}} phase were the CDU, VDU, sulphur gas unit, naphtha hydrotreater, <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> and visbreaker. The fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> and a diesel hydro desulphuriser were commissioned in November 2006.The FCC and DHDS plants were modified so as to be compliant with the cleaner Euro III and Euro IV fuels. The refinery configuration lends itself well to de-bottlenecking and its capacity is enhanced to 14mtpa in 2009.The docking facilities include an SBM capable of handling vessels up to 350,000DWT with a capacity of 25mtpa, tankages with interconnecting pipelines of 20mtpa capacity, marine product dispatch capacity of 12mtpa and rail-car and truck-loading facilities.|$|R

50|$|The {{popularity}} of the automobile in the early 1900s created a mass market for gasoline, and a shortage soon developed of the lighter gasoline fractions of crude oil. The shortage was solved by {{the invention of the}} <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker,</b> which broke long hydrocarbon chains into smaller molecules.|$|R
40|$|Arising {{from the}} {{discussion}} about a sustainable development of the energy sector, more and more interest of different industrial branches (e. g. in the automotive field or by the energy supply companies) is actually directed {{to the use of}} fuel cells. They show high degrees of ef-ficiency, little pollution and the ability of combined heat and power generation, and moreover they are modularly built. As a fuel they need hydrogen, but the infrastructure of its supply is much worse than necessary. So, at least for a time of transition, hydrogen must be produced from hydrocarbon fuels. A new idea is the hydrogen production from liquid higher hydrocar-bon compositions, as diesel fuel, in a <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker.</b> This diesel processor is based on a technology developed by the University of Essen-Duisburg at Duisburg. Liquid higher hydrocarbons, as diesel, also contain different sulfur compounds. The aim of this work was to gain knowledge about the influence of sulfur to a complete <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> system. The study consists of two parts, the first dealing with the influence of sulfur com-pounds to the <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> itself, and the second with the influence of the products of the reaction of sulfur compounds flowing with the resultant gas into the low-temperature Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell, PEMFC. In the <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> the influence of sulfur on the activity and the hydrogen selectivity of catalysts of two different precious metals  used separately as well as in mixture  is investi-gated. Furthermore, the catalysts stability under the cracking temperature of nearly 1, 200 K is tested. As an example, the effect of sulfur-containing fuel to a PEMFC is shown and analysed. Moreover, a mathematical-physical model is developed, describing the effects of the degra-dation of a PEMFC by sulfur contamination. Finally, the efficiency of a desulfurizing unit, pre-connected to the fuel cell to extend its lifetime, is investigated...|$|R
5000|$|May 5, 1988: Norco, Louisiana, Shell Oil {{refinery}} explosion after {{hydrocarbon gas}} escaped from a corroded pipe in a <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> and was ignited. Louisiana state police evacuated 2,800 residents from nearby neighborhoods. Seven workers {{were killed and}} 42 injured. The total cost arising from the Norco blast is estimated at US$706 million.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, the {{government}} approved a NZ$160 million {{expansion of the}} refinery, involving {{the addition of a}} fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker.</b> Later that year, the first global oil shock, sparked by the Yom Kippur War, raised crude oil prices from US$3 to around US$20 a barrel - however, New Zealand retained reasonable security of supply.|$|R
2500|$|Note {{that the}} above {{description}} {{assumes that the}} HDS unit feed contains no olefins. [...] If the feed does contain olefins (for example, the feed is a naphtha derived from a refinery fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> (FCC) unit), then the overhead gas from the HDS stripper may also contain some ethene, propene, butenes and pentenes, or heavier components.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, {{the plant}} {{constructed}} its first <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker,</b> or [...] "cat cracker", which went into operation on January 18, 1943. This development proved {{essential to the}} production of fuel to support the Allied war effort, especially high-octane aviation fuel, and also allowed the production of synthetic butyl rubber and materials used to manufacture explosives.|$|R

50|$|A second global {{oil shock}} in 1979, this time {{due to the}} Iranian revolution, greatly {{increased}} {{the price of oil}} again. This proved to be a catalyst for further expansion of the refinery, under the Muldoon National Governments Think Big energy projects. The estimated cost of expansion was $320 million, with a hydrocracker now considered rather than the planned <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2007, a {{distillate}} hydrotreater (HDS) was built. A {{hydrogen production}} unit (a methane steam reformer for the hydrotreater process) is being built, for completion in 2009. The new plant will provide ultra-low sulfur diesel and mean {{different types of}} crude oil can be processed, {{that can be made}} in a conventional <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> or hydrocracker.

50|$|The {{origins of}} Houston Refining date to 1918 when Harry Sinclair (Sinclair Oil) began {{building}} a battery {{still on the}} site. As the refinery grew, additional processing units were built to produce lubricants and aromatic chemicals, and {{with the addition of}} the fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> in 1952 and the 736 coker in 1968 the refinery {{emerged as one of the}} earliest full-conversion refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast.|$|R
50|$|Gasoline, jet {{and diesel}} fuel {{are the primary}} products, which are {{supplied}} to end users predominantly in Washington and Oregon. Its secondary processing facilities include a fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker,</b> an alkylation unit, hydrotreating units and a naphtha reformer. Given that configuration the plant likely follows a 10-5-3-2 crack spread, meaning that for 10 barrels of crude feedstock the refinery produces 5 barrels of gasoline, 3 barrels of distillate and 2 barrels of fuel oil.|$|R
50|$|The {{combustion}} {{flue gas}} from the catalyst regenerator of a fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> is at a temperature of about 715 °C and at a pressure of about 2.4 barg (240 kPa gauge). Its gaseous components are mostly carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N2). Although the flue gas has been through two stages of cyclones (located within the regenerator) to remove entrained catalyst fines, it still contains some residual catalyst fines.|$|R
40|$|Most North Sea {{atmospheric}} residues {{are well}} suited feedstocks to a residue fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> (RFCC) {{due to their}} low metals and asphalthene contents. StatoilHydro have used the circulating ARCO pilot unit at Chalmers University of Technology for pilot scale testing of catalysts and feedstocks since 1984. A comparison with the commercial RFCC unit showed that the converted ARCO unit works quite well and we are confident in the results. This will be exemplified with different cases that have happened since the project started...|$|R
5000|$|After the war, {{the use of}} coal {{for heating}} {{declined}} sharply in the United States. In 1947, Esso invested $26 million in a refinery expansion program to meet an increased post-war demand for gasoline and heating oil, and constructed a second, much larger <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> with an initial processing capacity of , replacing the original 1943 unit. The [...] "Cat" [...] came online in October 1949 and was {{the largest in the}} world during the twentieth century, and as of 2008 was the largest in the western hemisphere.|$|R

50|$|The Ferndale Refinery, {{owned by}} Phillips 66, has 101,000 b/d capacity, making it, as of 2015, the 64th {{largest in the}} United States, and {{produces}} predominantly transportation fuels consumed in local markets. The plant {{is located in the}} Cherry Point Industrial Zone, west of Ferndale, WA. Its secondary processing facilities include a fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker,</b> an alkylation unit, hydotreating units and a naphtha reformer. The plant follows a 10-5-3-2 crack spread, meaning that for 10 barrels of crude feedstock the refinery produces 5 barrels of gasoline, 3 barrels of distillate and 2 barrels of fuel oil.|$|R
5|$|Gulf {{also participated}} in a {{partnership}} with other majors, including Texaco, to build the Pembroke <b>Catalytic</b> <b>Cracker</b> refinery at Milford Haven and the associated Mainline Pipelines fuel distribution network. The eventual reopening of the Suez canal and upgrading of the older European oil terminals (Europoort and Marchwood) meant that the financial return from these projects was not all that had been hoped for. The Bantry terminal was devastated by the explosion of a Total tanker, the Betelgeuse, in January 1979 (Whiddy Island Disaster) and it was never fully reopened. The Irish government took over ownership of the terminal in 1986 and held its strategic oil reserve there.|$|R
5000|$|ESPs {{continue}} to be excellent devices for control of many industrial particulate emissions, including smoke from electricity-generating utilities (coal and oil fired), salt cake collection from black liquor boilers in pulp mills, and catalyst collection from fluidized bed <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> units in oil refineries to name a few. These devices treat gas volumes from several hundred thousand ACFM to 2.5 million ACFM (1,180 m³/s) in the largest coal-fired boiler applications.

50|$|Barauni Refinery {{was built}} in {{collaboration}} with Russia and Romania. Situated 125 km from Patna, it was built with an initial cost of Rs 49.40 crore. Barauni Refinery was commissioned in 1964 with a refining capacity of 1 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) and it was dedicated to the Nation by the then Union Minister for Petroleum, Prof. Humayun Kabir in January 1965. After de-bottlenecking, revamping and expansion project, its capacity today is 6 MMTPA. Matching secondary processing facilities such Residue Fluidized <b>Catalytic</b> <b>Cracker</b> (RFCC), Diesel Hydro treating (DHDT), Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU) have been added. Theses {{state of the art}} eco-friendly technologies have enabled the refinery to produce environment- friendly green fuels complying with international standards.|$|R
50|$|Milford Haven Refinery is {{situated}} on a 1200-acre site near Milford Haven. The refinery came on stream in 1973 under Amoco's ownership. A major upgrade {{was carried out}} in 1981, and a <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> was added. In the same year (1981) Murco (a subsidiary of Murphy Oil) purchased a 30% share of the refinery. Since then further units have been added, notably a naptha isomerisation unit and a hydrodesulphurisation unit. In August 1983, a major boilover fire required 150 firemen, 50 fire engines and two days to extinguish. Elf bought Amoco's interest in 1990 and Elf was acquired by Total in 2000. In December 2007 Murco purchased Total's 70% interest in the refinery to become the 100% owner.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-dimensional, two-phase flow and heat-transfer analysis of particles conveyed by gases in vertical pipes. This type of flow {{is found in}} many engineering applications and used in the riser reactor section of a Fluidized bed <b>Catalytic</b> <b>Cracker</b> (FCC). The phases involved are gas and catalyst particles. The analysis involves the formulation and the simultaneous solution of the differential equations describing the above processes. The solution of the relevant equations is effected by an efficient finite-difference procedure. It is concluded that effects of gas-injection geometry on flow field and temperature distribution inside the reactor can be predicted realistically. This work is a necessary background for the simulation of a catalytic cracking reaction, which {{takes place in a}} riser-type reactor...|$|R
50|$|In 1949 Esso {{embarked}} {{on the construction}} of a new refinery, and a further 1200 hectares of land were acquired. The first stage of this expansion, which came on-stream in 1951, consisted of primary distillation units, a <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> and numerous treating units. The refinery was opened by British prime minister Clement Attlee on 14 September 1951. It had an initial estimated capacity of 157,000 barrels per day, or around one third of UK demand at that time. The chemical plant was created in 1958. Additional refining capacity was added, and Fawley's capacity reached around 19,500,000 tonnes of crude oil per annum in 1973 (approximately 400,000 barrels per day), and has since decreased, partly because of reduced demand for oil.|$|R
50|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 5, {{expansion}} of the flue gas through a turboexpander provides sufficient power to drive the regenerator's combustion air compressor. The electrical motor-generator in the power recovery system can consume or produce electrical power. If the {{expansion of the}} flue gas does not provide enough power to drive the air compressor, the electric motor-generator provides the needed additional power. If the flue gas expansion provides more power than needed to drive the air compressor, than the electric motor-generator converts the excess power into electric power and exports it to the refinery's electrical system. The steam turbine shown in Figure 5 is used to drive the regenerator's combustion air compressor during start-ups of the fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> until there is sufficient combustion flue gas to take over that task.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we recall general methodologies we {{developed}} for observation and identification in nonlinear systems theory, and we show {{how they can}} be applied to real practical problems. In a previous paper, we introduced a filter which is intermediate between the extended Kalman filter in its standard version and its high-gain version, and we applied it to certain observation problems. But we were missing some important cases. Here, we show how to treat these cases. We also apply the same technique in the context of our identifiability theory. As non academic illustrations, we treat a problem of observation and a problem of identification, for a fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> (FCC). This FCC unit {{is one of the most}} crucial from the economic point of view, in petroleum industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of fines in a fluidized <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> unit (FCCU) due to catalyst attrition and fracture {{is a major}} source of catalyst loss. In addition to standard attrition tests described in the literature, the possibility that thermal conditions could lead to catalyst fracture and fines production has been explored. Samples of fresh and used (equilibrium or e-cat) type catalysts were heated up to 600 àand mixed with cold samples to determine the impact of thermal shock on particle stability. It was found that significant fracture occurs under these conditions, leading to loss of larger catalyst particles in the bed and significant gain in the amount of fine particles. Agglomeration of particles was also evident, in some cases leading to an increase in the quantity of larger particles appearing to be present in the catalyst sample. No Full Tex...|$|R
50|$|Shell Oil Products US, a {{subsidiary}} of Royal Dutch Shell PLC, operates the Puget Sound Refinery located on March Point outside of Anacortes, WA. The plant is the largest taxpayer in Skagit County {{and one of the}} county's largest employers. The refinery has a 145,000 b/d capacity, making it the 52nd largest in the USA, in 2015, with facilities that include a delayed coker, fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker,</b> polymerization unit and alkylation units. Based on the secondary processing units in place, the facility likely follows a 3-2-1 crack spread. Shell’s refinery produces three grades of gasoline, fuel oil, diesel fuel, propane and butane. This plant is currently the only refinery in Washington state unable to accommodate tight oil via rail. The permitting process is currently underway for the proposed 60,000 b/d unloading capacity of the East Gate Rail Project.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{presented}} {{for the resolution}} of the problem of input saturation in nonlinear multivariable process control by means of elementary nonlinear decoupling (END). Input saturation can have serious consequences particularly in multivariable control because it may lead to very undesirable system behaviour and quite often system instability. Many authors have searched for systematic techniques for designing multivariable control systems in which saturation may occur in any of the control variables (inputs, manipulated variables). No generally accepted method seems to have been presented so far which gives a solution in closed form. The method of elementary nonlinear decoupling (END) can be applied directly to the case of saturation control variables by deriving as many control strategies as there are combinations of saturating control variables. The method is demonstrated by the multivariable control of a simulated Fluidized <b>Catalytic</b> <b>Cracker</b> (FCC) with very convincing results...|$|R
40|$|A general {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} computer code (ICRKFLO) has been developed for the simulation of the multi-phase reacting flow in a petroleum fluid <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracker</b> riser. ICRKFLO has several unique features. A new integral reaction submodel couples calculations of hydrodynamics and cracking kinetics by making the calculations more efficient in achieving stable convergence while still preserving the major physical effects of reaction processes. A new coke transport submodel handles the process of coke formation in gas phase reactions and the subsequent deposition {{on the surface of}} adjacent particles. The code was validated by comparing with experimental results of a pilot scale fluid cracker unit. The code can predict the flow characteristics of gas, liquid, and particulate solid phases, vaporization of the oil droplets, and subsequent cracking of the oil in a riser reactor, which may lead {{to a better understanding of}} the internal processes of the riser and the impact of riser geometry and operating parameters on the riser performance...|$|R
