40|$|An {{increase}} of medium NaCl concentration induces Dunaliella cells to evolve O 2 photosynthetically {{even in the}} absence of CO 2. This NaCl-induced O 2 evolution may reflect the induced <b>conversion</b> of <b>reserve</b> carbohydrate to glycerol. The quantum yield for the NaCl-induced O 2 evolution, in the absence of CO 2, is 1. 5 -fold higher than that obtained for CO 2 fixation. Since the synthesis of glycerol from reserve carbohydrate in the absence of CO 2 requires only 0. 5 ATP/NADPH, whereas photosynthesis requires at least 1. 3 ATP/NADPH, it is concluded that the ATP/ 2 e− ratio coupled to NADP reduction in Dunaliella is lower than required for CO 2 fixation...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} sodium and {{magnesium}} chlorides and sulphates on carbohydrate metabolism of corn seedlings and their component parts were studied. There was {{a decrease in}} the total carbohydrate content of seedlings with advance of time, in control and in different concentrations of salts. The decrease became less marked with increase of salt concentrations. The main effect of salinization, on the changes in carbohydrates, was strongest on the roots and grains. The roots contained the lowest proportion of the various carbohydrate fractions. This feature suggests that the mobilization of carbohydrates from grains to roots is greatly retarded by salinization. Both cations and anions exert an influence on the <b>conversion</b> of <b>reserve</b> carbohydrates...|$|R
50|$|Malate synthase works {{together}} with isocitrate lyase in the glyoxylate cycle to bypass two oxidative steps of Krebs cycle and permit carbon incorporation from acetate or fatty acids in many microorganisms. As a result, the cell {{would not need}} to lose 2 molecules of carbon dioxide when entering the glyoxylate cycle rather than the Krebs cycle. This pathway is especially important to M. tuberculosis, allowing long-term persistence of its infection. When the M. tuberculosis becomes phagocytosed, the bacterium upregulates genes encoding the glyoxylate shunt enzymes. Since this cycle is not found in humans and other mammals, malate synthase {{is perceived as a}} future drug target against tuberculosis and other microorganisms. Within germinating plants, the glyoxylate cycle allows the <b>conversion</b> of <b>reserve</b> lipids into carbohydrates within glyoxysomes.|$|R

40|$|Summary &mdash; <b>Conversion</b> of <b>reserve</b> lipids in the seed, and {{carbohydrate}} and {{dry matter}} partitioning dur-ing germination were studied in walnut (Juglans regia L cv Franquette) seedlings. Nuts showed a gradual decrease in lipid content with a concomitant rise in carbohydrates (fig 2); starch {{appeared to be}} a transient sink for the end products of the degradation of lipid reserves. During germination, tap root elongation was preferential over stem growth (fig 3). The tap root accounted for most of the seedling dry matter increase and carbohydrate accumulation mainly as starch (table I). The other organs accu-mulated essentially soluble carbohydrates. At the end of the experiment, only 26. 7 % of the carbo-hydrates (starch + soluble carbohydrates) from lipid conversion were recovered in the seedling and the nut. A similar discrepancy was found in the energy budget. The energy loss from the nut (76. 391 kJ) and the total energy recovered in the seedling (30. 985 kJ) differed markedly {{at the end of the}} experi-ment (fig 4); this difference of 59 % can be attributed to the metabolic lipid conversion, respiration (growth and maintenance) and translocation (table II) ...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{organization}} {{literature suggests}} that property rights assignment affects employee incentives to shirk. Specifically, when firms own employee property rights, the rents from increased effort accrue to the employer and encourage shirking. Applied to major league baseball (MLB), {{this suggests that the}} <b>conversion</b> from the <b>reserve</b> clause to free agency should increase player effort. However, free agency also saw {{an increase in the number}} of guaranteed multiyear contracts, which also creates shirking incentives. This article investigates the net impact of property rights assignment on shirking in MLB. An empirical model reveals that free agents with 1 - and 2 -year contracts outperform comparable reserve era players over the same time frame. The performance of free agents with contracts exceeding 2 years do not differ from that of comparable reserve era players over the same time period.

40|$|Loligo opalescens live {{less than}} a year and die after a short {{spawning}} period before all oocytes are expended. Potential fecundity (EP), the standing stock of all oocytes just before the onset of spawning, increased with dorsal mantle length (L), where EP = 29. 8 L. For the average female squid (L of 129 mm), EP was 3844 oocytes. During the spawning period, no oogonia were produced; therefore the standing stock of oocytes declined as they were ovulated. This decline in oocytes was correlated with a decline in mantle condition and an increase {{in the size of the}} smallest oocyte in the ovary. Close agreement between the decline in estimated body weight and standing stock of oocytes during the spawning period indicated that maturation and spawning of eggs could largely, if not entirely, be supported by the <b>conversion</b> of energy <b>reserves</b> in tissue.

40|$|The Workshop brought {{together}} experts from APEC economies to discuss important {{issues related to}} coal development, trade and consumption in the APEC region, {{with a focus on}} Indonesia. Papers ranged from broad regional coal-related issues to specific policy and contract terms. The host, Indonesia, was selected as the focus of the workshop because it: (a) has APEC`s fastest growing electricity sector, (b) {{is in the process of}} switching from oil based electricity generation to coal and natural gas-based generation, (c) is among the fastest growing coal exporters in APEC, and (d) has a contract system for coal development that has been widely accepted by foreign investors. In addition, Indonesia is in the process of revising its coal policies, and might benefit from the timely discussions in this workshop. The papers presented in the workshop spanned the coal chain from coal resources and <b>reserves,</b> <b>conversion</b> technologies, economics and markets, legal and policy issues, to community and cultural concerns.

40|$|The use of {{perennial}} {{plant materials}} as a renewable {{source of energy}} may constitute an important opportunity to improve the environmental sustainability of managed land. Currently, the production of energy from agricultural products is primarily {{in the form of}} ethanol from corn grain, which used more than 45 % of the domestic U. S. corn crop in 2011. Concomitantly, using corn grain to produce ethanol has promoted landscape simplification and homogenization through <b>conversion</b> of Conservation <b>Reserve</b> Program grasslands to annual row crops, and has been implicated in increasing environmental damage, such as increased nitrate leaching into water bodies and increased rates of soil erosion. In contrast, perennial prairie vegetation {{has the potential to be}} used as a bioenergy feedstock that produces a substantial amount of biomass as well as numerous ecosystem services. Reincorporating prairies to diversify the landscape of the Midwestern U. S. at strategic locations could provide more habitat for animals, including beneficial insects, and decrease nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment movement into water bodies. In this dissertation, I present data from two field experiments that examine (1) how managing prairies for bioenergy production affects prairie ecology and agronomic performance and (2) how these prairie systems differ from corn systems managed for bioenergy production. Results of this work show that there are tradeoffs among prairie systems and between corn and prairie systems with respect to the amount of harvested biomass, root production, nutrient export, feedstock characteristics, growing season utilization, and species and functional group diversity. These results emphasize the need for a multifaceted approach to fully evaluate bioenergy feedstock production systems...|$|R
40|$|Mineral Resources {{and their}} {{subsequent}} <b>conversion</b> to Ore <b>Reserves</b> are of key importance to mining companies. Their reliable estimation {{is critical to}} both the confidence in a feasibility study, and also to the day-to-day operation of a mine. Together with sampling, assaying, geological and other errors introduced during interpretation and estimation, additional errors {{are likely to be}} introduced during the application of technical and economic parameters used for conversion of resources to reserves. There is thus a requirement for high-quality interpretation and estimation to be supported by high-quality data. Any company expecting to make sound investment or operational decisions must base this on both relevant and reliable information. An Ore Reserve statement generally contains a single set of grade and tonnage figures without a discussion of the potential inherent errors in these estimates. Some sensitivity studies may be run, but confidence limits are rarely quoted and, if they are, often do not take into account many of the factors that cause uncertainty in the grade and tonnage estimates. Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates thus carry certain errors leading to uncertainty and risk; some of these are unquantifiable for various reasons, for which the operator should be aware. This paper presents a review of the potential sources of error that might occur during a resource estimation program, which are carried through into the reserve estimate. A number of methods are discussed that allow the estimator to be more transparent about the inherent risks in his/her estimate. Emphasis is placed on data quality, and the requirement for strong quality management to be linked to continuous improvement...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{metabolism}} {{and its relation}} to survival of the infective juveniles (IJ) of S. carpocapsae under anaerobic and oxygen-deficient conditions were studied by monitoring changes in survival rate, levels of key energy reserve materials, oxygen consumption, and respiratory quotient (RQ). The effects of various factors on the survival of IJ under anaerobic conditions were also investigated. Under anaerobic conditions, the IJ were inactivated but could survive for several days in an immobile state, using the carbohydrate reserves glycogen and trehalose for energy supply. The survival time of IJ was mainly dependent on the availability of energy supply, which, in turn, was influenced by factors such as temperature and metabolic by-products. Surviving, anaerobically incubated IJ fully recovered upon return to aerobic conditions. Recovering IJ were characterized by regaining mobility and restoration of carbohydrate reserves consumed during the anaerobic period. Carbohydrate reserves were restored by <b>conversion</b> from lipid <b>reserves</b> and possibly from anaerobic metabolic by-products. The infectivity of IJ recovered from the anaerobic state was not affected. At 1 % oxygen level, IJ were also immobile and mainly depended on carbohydrate reserves for energy supply and the RQ was greater than 1. However, some oxygen was consumed; the survival time of these IJ was shorter than those kept in natural air but longer than those under anaerobic conditions. When IJ were incubated at oxygen levels of 3 % to 21 %, the RQs were maintained at 0. 7 to 0. 8. Oxygen consumption rates and the reduction in both mean dry weight and lipid levels were proportional to oxygen levels while the survival time of IJ was inversely proportional to oxygen levels...|$|R
40|$|Germination {{and early}} {{seedling}} growth are critical periods {{in the life}} cycle of plants. Starting from a quiescent dry state in the seed, embryos and seedlings need to maintain an efficient heterotrophic metabolism and cope with often stressful conditions, in order to rapidly reach autotrophy and start competing for nutriments and space. These processes are almost entirely dependent on mitochondrial respiration, which provides cellular energy as well as a metabolic platform involved in the <b>conversion</b> of seed <b>reserves</b> into building blocks for growth metabolism. It is therefore no surprise that seed mitochondria exhibit unusual properties in respect of desiccation and temperature tolerance. Stress proteins such as LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) proteins and sHSPs (small heat shock proteins) are involved in the protection of mitochondria in the dry state, and likely contribute to their thermal tolerance during germination. In many cases, fast germination increases the chances of successful emergence and establishment of seedlings, and this requires an efficient energy metabolism. Oxygen availability for respiration can be a challenge because of limiting oxygen diffusion rates in large seeds and/or within soils. It appears that, at least in legume seeds, mitochondria are able to self-adjust their oxygen consumption with the support of nitric oxide (NO) metabolism. This allows maximal energy production to be achieved under hypoxic conditions, without subjecting tissues to deleterious anoxia. In the context of ongoing and future climate change, it is of general importance to understand how mitochondrial functions have evolved to maintain energy homeostasis in organisms and tissues exposed to extreme environmental conditions such as desiccation. Such traits could offer interesting targets for plant adaptation and improvement...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSandstone-type uranium {{deposits}} contain approximately 28 % of {{the world}} uranium resources. Many of these deposits are located below the water table in weakly lithified or non-consolidated sands, and therefore they can be exploited using in situ leach (ISL) technology. Such technology is based on dissolving uranium minerals directly in their host rocks (in situ) by reactive solutions that are injected through drill holes and then pumping the dissolved solution to the surface through some discharge drill holes. Uranium grade is determined by down-hole geophysics, in particular the prompt fission neutrons, or PFN, technique, coupled with sampling and assaying of the drill core. The drill grid which is used in Kazakhstan for definition of ISL uranium resources are as follows: (i) Measured: average 506100 m (range from 25650 to 506100 m); (ii) Indicated: average 506200 m (range from 506100 to 506200 m); and (iii) Inferred: average 506400 m (range from 506400 to 1006800 m). Estimation and reporting of uranium resources for ISL projects differ from hard rock mining projects in the need for quantitative estimation of the geotechnical and hydrogeological parameters which are specific for ISL technologies. The main parameters which {{need to be considered}} are as follows: (i) grade and geometry of mineralisation are estimated with accuracy sufficient for supporting the remote mining; (ii) if grade is estimated using the gamma logging technique secular disequilibrium should be studied and reported; (iii) hydrogeological confinement of the mineralised horizon; (iv) permeability of the mineralised horizon; (v) composition of the host rocks, in particular the carbonate content, in order to estimate if uranium mineralisation is amenable to dissolution by acid or alkaline solutions; (vi) groundwater flow; (vii) aquifer salinity; and (viii) rate of the in-situ dissolution of the uranium minerals. Hydrogeological and geotechnical information is obtained by testing the drill core samples and in the field, using the pump tests and the down-hole piezometers. Modifying factors for <b>conversion</b> resources to <b>reserves</b> are verified and corrected using field leach tests of uranium. This test is a strict requirement for feasibility studies of the ISL uranium projects in Kazakhstan...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-seven {{individual}} {{tree growth}} models are reviewed. The models {{take into account}} the same main physiological processes involved in carbon metabolism (photosynthate production, respiration, reserve dynamics, allocation of assimilates and growth) and share common rationales that are discussed. It is shown that the spatial resolution and representation of tree architecture used mainly depend on model objectives. Beyond common rationales, the models reviewed exhibit very different treatments of each process involved in carbon metabolism. The treatments of all these processes are presented and discussed in terms of formulation simplicity, ability to account for response to environment, and explanatory or predictive capacities. Representation of photosynthetic carbon gain ranges from merely empirical relationships that provide annual photosynthate production, to mechanistic models of instantaneous leaf photosynthesis that explicitly account for the effects of the major environmental variables. Respiration is often described empirically as the sum of two functional components (maintenance and growth). Maintenance demand is described by using temperature-dependent coefficients, while growth efficiency is described by using temperature-independent <b>conversion</b> coefficients. Carbohydrate <b>reserve</b> pools are generally represented as black boxes and their dynamics is rarely addressed. Storage and reserve mobilisation are often treated as passive phenomena, and reserve pools are assumed to behave like buffers that absorb the residual, excessive carbohydrate on a daily or seasonal basis. Various approaches to modelling carbon allocation have been applied, {{such as the use of}} empirical partitioning coefficients, balanced growth considerations and optimality principles, resistance mass-flow models, or the source-sink approach. The outputs of carbon-based models of individual tree growth are reviewed, and their implications for forestry and ecology are discussed. Three critical issues for these models to date are identified: (i) the representation of carbon allocation and of the effects of architecture on tree growth is Achilles' heel of most of tree growth models; (ii) reserve dynamics is always poorly accounted for; (iii) the representation of below ground processes and tree nutrient economy is lacking in most of the models reviewed. Addressing these critical issues could greatly enhance the reliability and predictive capacity of individual tree growth models in the near future...|$|R
