40|$|Abstract – The smelter at Bindura Nickel Corporation {{processes}} concentrates {{from its}} own mines and other external sources. Concentrates are dried, smelted, and converted to a desulphurised matte (leach alloy) for further processing at the refinery. The smelter comprises a drying plant, submerged arc electric furnace, electrostatic precipitator, and three Peirce-Smith type converters capable of treating 150 000 tonnes of concentrates per year. Concentrates are dried in a rotary coal-fired kiln, blended with fluxes, and smelted in a six-in-line submerged-arc 15 MW electric furnace. Slag is tapped and granulated for disposal, and matte is tapped at regular intervals for blowing in Peirce-Smith converters. The paper details the 37 -year history of the smelter, including <b>furnace</b> <b>rebuilds</b> and operating parameters as they have evolved in response to changing feed compositions.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was developed to}} predict physico-chemical phenomena occurring within the combustion space of a directly-fired natural gas <b>furnace.</b> The <b>complete</b> <b>furnace</b> model included submodels to solve momentum, species concentration, and energy conservation equations throughout the furnace volume. Supplementary equations were solved to predict turbulence, radiative heat transfer, nitric oxide formation, and the oxidation of soot particles. Both the submodels and the <b>complete</b> <b>furnace</b> model were validated by comparing predictions with experimental data {{from a variety of}} flows, flames, and furnaces. ^ The furnace model was used to investigate particle seeding within a 12 MW directly-fired furnace. Particles were assumed to be non-scattering and to have the same optical properties as soot. An initial study of non-oxidizing particles seeded uniformly throughout the furnace volume indicated an optimum range of seeding concentration, afforded an understanding of how different regions of the furnace respond to particle seeding, and guided the selection of a particle injection rate for non-uniform seeding studies. ^ Studies with non-uniform seeding concentrations revealed the effects of particle oxidation and furnace wall temperature. Non-oxidizing particles increased the total incident radiative heat rate to the furnace outer wall by more than 20 %, and decreased nitric oxide formation by an order of magnitude due to reduced peak temperatures in regions of significant nitric oxide formation. Particle oxidation was found to destroy virtually all the particles near the edges of the flame, thereby preventing any significant heat transfer enhancement although nitric oxide formation was still reduced. ^ Furnace wall temperature affected the heat transfer processes within the furnace and altered {{the way in which the}} furnace was affected by particle seeding. Increasing the wall temperature from 400 to 1200 K led to an increased density of radiative energy within the furnace volume. With (non-oxidizing) particle seeding, much of this energy was absorbed in the core of the flame where a high concentration of particles reside. The total incident radiative heat rate was increased by 11 % and the net radiative heat transfer was increased by approximately 30 %. ...|$|R

Second, because of the nature of the iron content of the copper ingots 2 and some of the unique iron artifacts which have been found, 3 it may be the strongest evidence that demonstrates that early iron smelting and metallurgy developed directly from copper metallurgy. For this study, a small piece of a copper ingot found at the site identified as Timna Site 2 (sample no. 575) was provided by Beno Rothenberg, the director of the excavations at Timna.

40|$|For the {{automatic}} control of glass quality in glass production, {{the relation between}} process variable and product or glass quality and process conditiondprocess input parameters must be known in detail. So far, detailed 3 -D glass melting simulation models were used to predict the effect of process input variables, such as fuel consumption and fuel distribution, load and load distribution, and electrical boosting, on the flow pattern (residence times, short cut flows), temperature distribution and redox state of the glass in the furnace. For feeder control, the main objectives are stable temperature and temperature uniformity in the spout section of the feeder just before the glass melt is delivered to the forming process. However, computations of detailed 3 -D simulation models are very time-consuming: one steady state simulation of a <b>complete</b> <b>furnace</b> including refiner(s) typically takes about a day. This time demand indicates that the currently used detailed 3 -D simulation models are not suitable for rigorous (CFD) model based Model Predictive Control (ME).

25|$|A higher {{cracking}} temperature (also {{referred to}} as severity) favors the production of ethene and benzene, whereas lower severity produces higher amounts of propene, C4-hydrocarbons and liquid products. The process also results in the slow deposition of coke, a form of carbon, on the reactor walls. This degrades {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, so reaction conditions are designed to minimize this. Nonetheless, a steam cracking furnace can usually only run for a few months at a time between de-cokings. Decokes require the furnace to be isolated from the process and then a flow of steam or a steam/air mixture is passed through the furnace coils. This converts the hard solid carbon layer to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Once this reaction is <b>complete,</b> the <b>furnace</b> can be returned to service.|$|R

50|$|Rather {{than being}} able to melt the iron ore into a <b>complete</b> billet, the <b>furnaces</b> of the period were only able to produce small pieces of iron, which were {{subsequently}} forge welded into a single blade. To accomplish this, the pieces would either be beaten into thin sheets that were then hammered together as a laminated blade or placed together as thin rods and then welded together. Additionally, some of these blades were constructed using pattern welding. With this method, the iron was beaten into strips, which were twisted together and then forge welded. The twisting removed much surface slag, which could cause weaknesses in the finished blade. Pattern welding also produced patterns in the finished blade, most commonly a herringbone pattern. Such patterns are often referenced in Anglo-Saxon literature—they are described using terms such as brogenmæl ("weaving marks"), wundenmæl ("winding marks"), grægmæl ("grey mark"), and scirmæl ("brightly patterned"). Therefore, {{it has been suggested}} that the decoration produced by pattern-welding was important and desired in Anglo-Saxon society. Many blades also had a fuller, which was a shallow groove that ran the length of the blade. The fuller reduced the blade's overall weight while not compromising the thickness. Fullers were produced by hammering into the blade or chiselling out a section.|$|R
