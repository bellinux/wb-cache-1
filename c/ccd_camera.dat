25|$|Parallel or full field OCT using a {{charge-coupled}} device (<b>CCD)</b> <b>camera</b> {{has been used}} in which the sample is full-field illuminated and en face imaged with the CCD, hence eliminating the electromechanical lateral scan. By stepping the reference mirror and recording successive en face images a three-dimensional representation can be reconstructed. Three-dimensional OCT using a <b>CCD</b> <b>camera</b> was demonstrated in a phase-stepped technique, using geometric phase shifting with a Linnik interferometer, utilising a pair of CCDs and heterodyne detection, and in a Linnik interferometer with an oscillating reference mirror and axial translation stage. Central to the CCD approach is the necessity for either very fast CCDs or carrier generation separate to the stepping reference mirror to track the high frequency OCT carrier.|$|E
25|$|Electron {{diffraction}} of solids {{is usually}} {{performed in a}} Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) where the electrons pass through a thin film of the material to be studied.

25|$|Visualization of {{the sample}} plane is usually {{accomplished}} through illumination via a separate light source coupled into the optical path {{in the opposite direction}} using dichroic mirrors.

25|$|Colonoscopy is the {{endoscopic}} {{examination of the}} large intestine and the distal part of the small bowel with a <b>CCD</b> <b>camera</b> or a fiber optic camera on a flexible tube passed through the anus. It can provide a visual diagnosis (e.g. ulceration, polyps) and grants the opportunity for biopsy or removal of suspected colorectal cancer lesions. Colonoscopy can remove polyps as small as one millimetre or less. Once polyps are removed, they can be studied {{with the aid of}} a microscope to determine if they are precancerous or not. It takes 15 years or less for a polyp to turn cancerous.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{or light}} {{microscopy}} involves passing visible light transmitted through or reflected {{from the sample}} through a single lens or multiple lenses to allow a magnified view of the sample. The resulting image can be detected directly by the eye, imaged on a photographic plate, or captured digitally. The single lens with its attachments, or the system of lenses and imaging equipment, along with the appropriate lighting equipment, sample stage, and support, makes up the basic light microscope. The most recent development is the digital microscope, which uses a <b>CCD</b> <b>camera</b> {{to focus on the}} exhibit of interest. The image is shown on a computer screen, so eye-pieces are unnecessary.|$|E
500|$|Halley's 1986 {{apparition}} was {{the least}} favorable on record. The comet and Earth were {{on opposite sides of}} the Sun in February 1986, creating the worst viewing circumstances for Earth observers for the last 2,000 years. Halley's closest approach was 0.42 AU. [...] Additionally, with increased light pollution from urbanization, many people failed to even see the comet. It was possible to observe it in areas outside of cities with the help of binoculars. Further, the comet appeared brightest when it was almost invisible from the northern hemisphere in March and April. Halley's approach was first detected by astronomers David Jewitt and G. Edward Danielson on 16 October 1982 using the 5.1m Hale telescope at Mount Palomar and a <b>CCD</b> <b>camera.</b> The first person to visually observe the comet on its 1986 return was amateur astronomer Stephen James O'Meara on 24 January 1985. O'Meara used a home-built 24-inch telescope on top of Mauna Kea to detect the magnitude 19.6 comet. On 8 November 1985, Stephen Edberg (then serving as the Coordinator for Amateur Observations at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and Charles Morris were the first to observe Halley's Comet with the naked eye in its 1986 apparition.|$|E

2500|$|More precisely, {{interferometric}} {{images are}} created by a Michelson interferometer where the path length difference is varied by a fast electric component (usually a piezo mirror in the reference arm).

2500|$|The {{orientation}} of the angles of P and C are chosen {{in such a way}} that the elliptically polarized light is completely linearly polarized after it is reflected off the sample. For simplification of future calculations, the compensator can be fixed at a 45 degree angle relative to the plane of incidence of the laser beam. [...] This set up requires the rotation of the analyzer and polarizer in order to achieve null conditions. [...] The ellipsometric null condition is obtained when A is perpendicular with respect to the polarization axis of the reflected light achieving complete destructive interference, i.e., the state at which the absolute minimum of light flux is detected at the <b>CCD</b> <b>camera.</b> The angles of P, C, and A obtained are used to determine the Ψ and Δ values of the material.|$|E
2500|$|Ellipsometry {{can also}} be done as imaging {{ellipsometry}} by using a <b>CCD</b> <b>camera</b> as a detector. This provides a real time contrast image of the sample, which provides information about film thickness and refractive index. Advanced imaging ellipsometer technology operates {{on the principle of}} classical null ellipsometry and real-time ellipsometric contrast imaging. [...] Imaging ellipsometry is based on the concept of nulling. [...] In ellipsometry, the film under investigation is placed onto a reflective substrate. [...] The film and the substrate have different refractive indexes. [...] In order to obtain data about film thickness, the light reflecting off of the substrate must be nulled. [...] Nulling is achieved by adjusting the analyzer and polarizer so that all reflected light off of the substrate is extinguished. [...] Due to the difference in refractive indexes, this will allow the sample to become very bright and clearly visible. The light source consists of a monochromatic laser of the desired wavelength. A common wavelength that is used is 532nm green laser light. [...] Since only intensity of light measurements are needed, almost any type of camera can be implemented as the CCD, which is useful if building an ellipsometer from parts. [...] Typically, imaging ellipsometers are configured in such a way so that the laser (L) fires a beam of light which immediately passes through a linear polarizer (P). [...] The linearly polarized light then passes through a quarter wavelength compensator (C) which transforms the light into elliptically polarized light. [...] This elliptically polarized light then reflects off the sample (S), passes through the analyzer (A) and is imaged onto a <b>CCD</b> <b>camera</b> by a long working distance objective. The analyzer here is another polarizer identical to the P, however, this polarizer serves to help quantify the change in polarization and is thus given the name analyzer. [...] This design is commonly referred to as a LPCSA configuration.|$|E
2500|$|The SSI was an 800-by-800-pixel {{solid state}} camera {{consisting}} of an array of silicon sensors called a charge-coupled device (CCD). Galileo {{was one of the}} first spacecraft to be equipped with a <b>CCD</b> <b>camera.</b> [...] The optical portion of the camera was built as a Cassegrain telescope. Light was collected by the primary mirror and directed to a smaller secondary mirror that channeled it through a hole in the center of the primary mirror and onto the CCD. The CCD sensor was shielded from radiation, a particular problem within the harsh Jovian magnetosphere. The shielding was accomplished by means of a [...] thick layer of tantalum surrounding the CCD except where the light enters the system. An eight-position filter wheel was used to obtain images at specific wavelengths. The images were then combined electronically on Earth to produce color images. The spectral response of the SSI ranged from about 0.4 to 1.1micrometres. The SSI weighed [...] and consumed, on average, 15 watts of power.|$|E
