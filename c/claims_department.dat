40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss a {{methodology}} for establishing reserves for {{the portion of}} loss adjustment expense associated {{with the cost of}} claim adjusters. These costs are a substantial component of the expenses traditionally defined as unallocated loss adjustment expense (ULAE). The actuarial literature contains very little material on how to estimate ULAE reserves. The most common methods are variations on the calendar year paid-to-paid methodology. The literature briefly mentions "transaction-based " methods that require <b>claim</b> <b>department</b> time studies. However, these methods are dismissed as too complex to perform. Fortunately, it is no longer necessary to sit with a stopwatch at a claims adjuster's desk to perform a time study. Most <b>claim</b> <b>departments</b> of major insurance carriers and third party administrators now utilize sophisticated automated work measurement tools. Many of these automated systems capture the type of data {{that can be used to}} perform an automated time study.

50|$|Insurance company <b>claims</b> <b>departments</b> {{employ a}} large number of claims {{adjusters}} supported by a staff of records management and data entry clerks. Incoming claims are classified based on severity and are assigned to adjusters whose settlement authority varies with their knowledge and experience.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a methodology}} for establishing reserves for {{the portion of}} loss adjustment expense as-sociated {{with the cost of}} claim adjusters. The actuar-ial literature contains very little material on how to estimate unallocated loss adjustment expense (ULAE) reserves. The literature briefly mentions “transaction-based ” methods that require <b>claim</b> <b>department</b> time studies. However, many feel that the improvement in estimating ULAE reserves does not justify the high cost of performing such a study. Fortunately, most <b>claim</b> <b>departments</b> of major insurance carriers and third party administrators now utilize sophisticated automated work measurement tools that may capture the type of data {{that can be used to}} perform an automated time study. The first section describes a process that can be used to perform the work-study, including a discus-sion of the technical and practical issues in conduct-ing such a study. The second section shows how the results of the study can be utilized to determine claim adjuster expense reserves. Other potential applications of the claim standards will be discussed, including pric-ing unbundled claim service, allocating claim depart-ment expense to line of business for statutory and man-agement reporting purposes, and monitoring claim de-partment expenses.
