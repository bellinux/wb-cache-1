5|$|The House of Foryx is {{a magical}} house {{situated}} somewhere deep in another forest, surrounded by perpetual winter. It is an octagonal building flanked by four octagonal pillars. Here all times meet, and characters <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> one time to another. Characters can {{come into the}} building from any time, but can leave it in their own time only if another from that time stands outside the main door; otherwise they are lost in time, and may even {{end up in a}} time when the House of Foryx did not exist, giving them no chance of ever returning. The house is named after Foryx, a huge elephantine creature in the Septimus Heap universe.|$|E

25|$|Visibility {{can vary}} from nearly {{unlimited}} to low, or non-existent, and <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> one extreme to {{the other in a}} single dive. While a less-intensive kind of diving called cavern diving does not take divers beyond the reach of natural light (and typically no deeper than 100ft, and penetration not further than 200ft), true cave diving can involve penetrations of many thousands of feet, well beyond the reach of sunlight. The level of darkness experienced creates an environment impossible to see in without an artificial form of light. Caves often contain sand, mud, clay, silt, or other sediment that can further reduce underwater visibility in seconds when stirred up.|$|E
25|$|Banks {{can create}} new money {{when they make}} a loan. New loans {{throughout}} the banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system. The money supply is usually increased by the act of lending, and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated. In the United Kingdom between 1997 and 2007, {{there was an increase}} in the money supply, largely caused by much more bank lending, which served to push up property prices and increase private debt. The amount of money in the economy as measured by M4 in the UK went from £750 billion to £1700 billion between 1997 and 2007, much of the increase caused by bank lending. If all the banks increase their lending together, then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase. Excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default, the banks then become more cautious, so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> boom to bust as happened in the UK and many other Western economies after 2007.|$|E

500|$|The DB9 {{has been}} adapted {{for use in}} sports car racing by Aston Martin Racing, a {{collaboration}} between Aston Martin and Prodrive. Called the DBR9, the car debuted in 2005. It retains the DB9's 5.9 L V12 engine basic parts, but the car has been extensively modified to decrease its weight {{as well as to}} improve performance. Most of the car's aluminium body panels have been replaced with carbon fibre panels, and several external features, like a front splitter and a rear wing, have been added to increase the car's downforce. Inside, the DB9's interior has mostly been scrapped to save weight. Likewise, though the suspension's layout remains the same, it has been improved to racing specifications. The brakes are upgraded to Brembo carbon-carbon disks and six-piston calipers. The transmission in the DBR9 is a Xtrac six-speed sequential manual, containing a Salisbury friction-plate limited-slip differential, and the prop shaft is also made of carbon fibre. The engine modifications allow the car to develop [...] and [...] of torque; that power, in addition to the lost weight, allows the DBR9 <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> 0 to [...] in 6.4 seconds.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} Obsessed was thought up by Clint Culpepper, {{president}} of Screen Gems, and was shared with David Loughery, {{who wrote the}} screenplay. Producer William Packer read the script and signed on; executive producers for the film were Glenn S. Gainor, Jeff Graup, Earvin [...] "Magic" [...] Johnson, Beyoncé, Mathew Knowles, Damon Lee and Loughery, while Nicholas Stern and George Flynn served as co-producer and associate producer, respectively. Director Steve Shill signed on after reading the script and hearing that Beyoncé was on board. Part of the reason Elba joined in was that the black–white theme was ignored; [...] "It's {{not mentioned in the}} film, it's never an issue, and I think that's phenomenal ... To me, that was very refreshing that the studio execs didn't want to make an issue of it." [...] Obsessed was allocated a production budget of $20 million. Shill stated that the intended effect of the film was to have the audience discuss the characters' motivations. Writer David Loughery designed Lisa as [...] "not a villain in a traditional sense; she's not setting out to wreck a marriage or ruin somebody's life. She really believes that [...] is in love with her." [...] Lisa's past was deliberately omitted from the film, explaining, [...] "It's scarier if we never really know how she's developed this personality that <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> very loving to ultimately deadly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Whereas ordinals {{are useful}} for {{ordering}} the objects in a collection, they are distinct from cardinal numbers, which {{are useful for}} saying how many objects are in a collection. Although the distinction between ordinals and cardinals is not always apparent in finite sets (one <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> {{one to the other}} just by counting labels), different infinite ordinals can describe the same cardinal. [...] Like other kinds of numbers, ordinals can be added, multiplied, and exponentiated, although the addition and multiplication are not commutative.|$|E

2500|$|Further, this {{formulation}} {{does not}} treat {{the rate of}} profit as a price determined by supply and demand. Rather, it fits more with neoclassical conceptions of [...] "normal" [...] profits. These refer to the basic profits that the owners of capital must receive {{in order to stay}} in business in their sector. Third, while neoclassical economics assumes that the [...] "normal" [...] rate of profit is determined by aggregate production (as discussed above), this formulation takes the rate of profit as exogenously given. That is because the whole neoclassical theory of profit-rate determination is being questioned: if we <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> the marginal product of capital to the profit rate, {{we should be able to}} go from the profit rate to the marginal product.

2500|$|There {{are several}} current bands that are broadly tagged under {{suburban}} {{but are not}} easy to categorize: Arbol is arguably the most talented of them: their albums <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> hardcore to balladry, and from hard rock to folk and reggae. Los Tipitos and Villanos present a more melodic style of suburban. Los Tipitos show a tendency to mature pop-rock; Villanos's sound is cheery and shows more buoyancy, and at times slides towards the sound of Argentine [...] "sonic" [...] rock with a dash of punk. And Intoxicados has been burning the rock charts throughout 2006, their latest effort Otro Dia en en Planeta Tierra (2005) digging hit after charting hit. A diverse album stylistically with lyrics whose content seem not to match the music, it features the suburban blueprint sound but it is used more as a foundation than a showcase. [...] One could also include Smitten (band). Romapagana, a punk-inspired band, now commands great respect in certain circles. Formed by Luca Prodan's younger brother, Andrea, it points to a new urban sound with guerrilla-like intensity.|$|E
2500|$|Education in Northern Ireland {{is heavily}} segregated. Most state schools in Northern Ireland are {{predominantly}} Protestant, {{while the majority}} of Catholic children attend schools maintained by the Catholic Church. In all, 90 per cent of children in Northern Ireland still go to separate faith schools. The consequence is, as one commentator has put it, that [...] "the overwhelming majority of Ulster's children <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> four to 18 without having a serious conversation with a member of a rival creed." [...] The prevalence of segregated education has been cited as a major factor in maintaining endogamy (marriage within one's own group). The integrated education movement has sought to reverse this trend by establishing non-denominational schools such as the Portadown Integrated Primary. Such schools are, however, still the exception to the general trend of segregated education. Integrated schools in Northern Ireland have been established through the voluntary efforts of parents. The churches have not been involved in the development of integrated education. However, both the Catholic Church and Protestant denominations, along with state-run institutions, have supported and organized cross-community school projects such as joint field trips, educational classes and forums wherein pupils can come together to share their beliefs, values and cultures.|$|E
2500|$|Unless you are {{allergic}} to the pollen of certain trees and herbs (such as birch, horse chestnut, alder, lilac, cherry tree, ash tree, rowan tree, lime tree, dandelion), {{the best time}} for travelling to central European Russia is late spring when the temperatures are pleasant and many trees are in bloom, and early and mid autumn when trees change their colour and it is not cold yet. Summer months are also good except for June in cities in central and south Russia when poplar fluff can be a nuisance, but recently the authorities of many Russian cities have taken action against the fluff by cutting and removing poplar trees and the situation has improved dramatically. Late autumn, winter months, and early spring will be enjoyable if you wear appropriate clothes and shoes. If you are interested in winter activities, in central European Russia it usually begins to snow in late autumn and snowpack usually doesn't melt away completely before early April, although spells of warm weather do occur and snow can temporarily melt away in mid-winter. Ski resorts in mountainous areas have snow throughout the winter season.
