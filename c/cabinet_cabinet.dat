2500|$|Cabinet {{table saws}} are heavy (using {{large amounts of}} cast iron and steel) to {{minimize}} vibration and increase accuracy. A cabinet saw is characterized by having an enclosed base (<b>cabinet).</b> <b>Cabinet</b> saws usually have induction motors in the 3 to 5 hp (2 to 4kW) range, single-phase, but motors in the 5 to 7 HP (4 to 6kW) range, three-phase, are common in commercial/industrial sites. For home use, this type of motor typically requires that a heavy-duty circuit be installed (in the US, this requires a 240 volt receptacle, or [...] "hard" [...] wiring and a dedicated branch circuit). The motor is enclosed within the cabinet and drives the blade with two to four parallel V-belts, often [...] "A" [...] belts as [...] "A" [...] belts may be ganged without having to be specially selected (otherwise, specially selected sets of light-duty [...] "4L" [...] belts are used). Cabinet saws are heavier and offer the following advantages over contractor saws: heavier construction for lower vibration and increased durability; a cabinet-mounted trunnion (the mechanism that incorporates the saw blade mount and allows for height and tilt adjustment); improved dust collection due to the totally enclosed cabinet and common incorporation of a dust collection port. Cabinet saws are designed for, and are capable of very high duty-cycles, such as are encountered in commercial/industrial applications. Where some {{of the advantages of}} a cabinet saw are desired in a home shop application, so-called [...] "hybrid" [...] saws have emerged to address this need.|$|E

5000|$|Proponents of {{the presidential}} system also argue that {{stability}} extends to the cabinets chosen under the system, compared to a parliamentary system where cabinets must be drawn from within the legislative branch. Under the presidential system, cabinet members can be selected from a much larger pool of potential candidates. This allows presidents the ability to select cabinet members based {{as much or more}} on their ability and competency to lead a particular department as on their loyalty to the president, as opposed to parliamentary cabinets, which might be filled by legislators chosen for no better reason than their perceived loyalty to the prime minister. Supporters {{of the presidential}} system note that parliamentary systems are prone to disruptive [...] "cabinet shuffles" [...] where legislators are moved between portfolios, whereas in presidential system cabinets (such as the United States <b>Cabinet),</b> <b>cabinet</b> shuffles are unusual.|$|E
50|$|These ministers then meet in {{a council}} known as <b>Cabinet.</b> <b>Cabinet</b> {{meetings}} are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated. The Constitution does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; it exists solely by convention. Its decisions do not {{in and of themselves}} have legal force. However, it serves as the practical expression of the Federal Executive Council, which is Australia's highest formal governmental body. In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. All members of the Cabinet are members of the Executive Council. While the Governor-General is nominal presiding officer, she or he almost never attends Executive Council meetings. The Governor-General is bound by convention to follow the advice of the Executive Council on almost all occasions, giving it de facto executive power. A senior member of the Cabinet holds the office of Vice-President of the Executive Council and acts as presiding officer of the Executive Council {{in the absence of the}} Governor-General. The Federal Executive Council is the Australian equivalent of the Executive Councils and privy councils in other Commonwealth realms such as the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and the Privy Council of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|Digital cabinet {{emulation}} is {{the treatment}} of a signal with the simulation of {{the sound of a}} speaker and a cabinet. It is available in software, [...] "stompbox" [...] pedals, and in some guitar amps with a [...] "cabinet modeling" [...] feature. Cabinet emulation is complex, but at its core it is the use of digital equalization which, combined with resonance models that reproduce the frequency response of the mounted speaker as well as the internal reflections and standing waves of the <b>cabinet.</b> <b>Cabinet</b> emulators typically offer the user a range of commonly-used presets (e.g., different sizes of speaker cabinet, from small combo amps to large 8x10" [...] "stacks" [...] and different types or styles of speaker or cabinet, for traditional, blues, metal and other genres). Some cabinet emulator systems also allow the user to select the type of miking or the position of the microphones (e.g., front miking, rear miking, etc.). There is debate about how successful this level of emulation is or can be from a musical perspective. Technically, with enough funding and effort, it is possible to emulate a particular speaker/cabinet combination, but so many factors also affect the sound (eg, the room in which the speaker/cabinet is being used, the amplfier driving it, ...) that musical success for a particular observer may be justly debated.|$|E
