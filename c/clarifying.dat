In his 1992 study of Mycena, Dutch mycologist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus put M.aurantiomarginata in the section Luculentae, characterized by species with an olive to yellowish-olive and moist cap, pallid to gray-olive gills with bright orange margins, brownish to grayish-olive stipes, white spore deposit, and spiny cystidia. M.aurantiomarginata was included in a 2010 molecular analysis focused on <b>clarifying</b> the phylogenetic relationships between Northern European species in the section Calodontes.

5|$|Four Albatrellus {{species were}} {{included}} in a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of the order Russulales published in 2003. Based on their ribosomal DNA sequences, the four form a clade, or monophyletic group (that is, they derived from a single ancestor). Of the four tested species, A.ovinus was most closely related to A.subrubescens. The polypore Wrightoporia lenta (type species of the genus Wrightoporia) occurred on a single branch basal to the albatrellus clade, implying that it shared with the Albatrellus species a common ancestor from which both were descended. In a more recent (2010) molecular analysis by Canadian mycologist Serge Audet aimed at <b>clarifying</b> relationships among species formerly placed in Scutiger, A.subrubescens grouped in a clade with A.ovinus and A.citrinus. According to Audet, these species, in addition to A.avellaneus and A.piceiphilus, are the constituents of an Albatrellus with limits defined by molecular genetics. Other Albatrellus species were transferred to segregate genera: A.fletti and A.confluens to Albatrellopsis; A.caeruleoporus and A.yasudae to Neoalbatrellus; A.pes-caprae and A.ellisii to an amended Scutiger.|$|E
