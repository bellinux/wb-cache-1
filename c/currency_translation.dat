The problem of translation is magnified by the diversity of accounting standards and methods currently in use throughout the world. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), currently the most authoritative rule-making body of the accounting profession in the United States, issued Statement No. 8 in an attempt to set accounting standards for foreign <b>currency</b> <b>translation.</b> The investors in multinational organizations need a more realistic representation of foreign earnings capacity than that provided by the temporal method of accounting for foreign <b>currency</b> <b>translation</b> proposed by the FASB. The temporal method presents a serious problem for investors in that it ignores the financial relationships as they exist in foreign environments. The primary objective and the purpose of this thesis is to search for, investigate, and develop a useful method of translation of foreign currency financial statements for use by investors and to illustrate the application of this method. The proposed method, while not an absolute or perfect translation method under all circumstances, is the most theoretically sound of the currently available methods for use by investors because it recognizes and maintains the financial relationships as they exist in foreign environments.

40|$|Early {{professional}} accountancy associations justified their {{applications for}} incorporation by Royal Charter or under relevant legislation {{on the premise}} that the public interest would be served if work of an accounting nature was restricted to those with the requisite knowledge and skill. A claim to specialised knowledge and skill was used by the profession to achieve hegemonic domination of not only accounting practice but also the determination of appropriate accounting practices or accounting standards. The success of the Australian accountancy profession in achieving its objective is evident in its domination of the promulgation of approved accounting standards that have the force of law. However, an examination of unexpected corporate failures or the reporting of losses on activities previously disclosed as profitable, suggest the profession 2 ̆ 7 s domination of accounting has not necessarily served the public interest Accounting standards and practices {{have been shown to be}} deficient in that the flexibility in their application has been used by corporate management in some instances, to create an impression through the financial statements that companies were well-managed and profitable. The reality, often revealed by investigators in the wake of corporate collapse, is that some of these companies have consistently reported profits when, in fact, they have been unprofitable for a number of years prior to collapse. This study offers an explanation of the profession 2 ̆ 7 s propensity to promote indetermination in accounting practice through the promulgation of flexible and vague accounting standards. In particular, this study maintains that flexible accounting standards and practices are a result of the profession 2 ̆ 7 s need to ensure its autonomy not only in the practice of accountancy but also domination of the determination of appropriate accounting practice. This requires maintaining alliances and structural coupling between the profession and business interests. The theoretical framework adopted for purposes of analysing the manner in which the profession originally attained and has since maintained hegemonic domination of accountancy is based on a translation model of power incorporating the concept of autopoiesis. The study provides an overview of the professionalisation of accountancy, in particular, the development of its knowledge base that was then used to justify its claim to domination in the public interest. Some notable unexpected Australian corporate failures are used to demonstrate that the public interest m a y not have been served because flexibility in accounting practice have been utilised to mislead users of financial statements. The development of the standard dealing with accounting for foreign <b>currency</b> transactions and <b>translations</b> is used to demonstrate that standard setting is as much political as technical.

40|$|The New Zealand {{standard}} on foreign <b>currency</b> <b>translation</b> (FRS- 21), similar to {{standards in the}} US, Australia, and Canada and the International Accounting Standard (IAS- 21), requires the classification of foreign operations for translation purposes into two mutually exclusive types: integrated or independent. In judging whether a foreign operation is either integrated or independent, the accounting standard requires the evaluation of five qualitative factors. The standard neither describes the judgement process nor identifies {{the relative importance of}} the determining factors. It has been asserted that the lack of clarity in the {{standard on}} foreign <b>currency</b> <b>translation</b> may yield dissimilar results for firms whose circumstances are similar and consequently may reduce the comparability of financial statements across firms. Using a repeated measures design, this paper examines the judgement of preparers of financial statements (New Zealand financial controllers) in determining the designation of foreign operations for translation purposes. The results indicate that the relative importance of the determining factors is marginally unequal. No support is found for the assertion that the use of qualitative factors in accounting standards results in dissimilar judgements (lack of consensus) across respondents. Further, the results show that the subjects demonstrated consistency and self-insight in their judgements. Further, the results indicate that the judgements of respondents are not biased toward either classification of foreign operation. This may suggest that the observed bias may be motivated by economic factors rather than the outcome of using the qualitative cues in the accounting standard.

40|$|Policy {{makers have}} long been {{concerned}} that adjustments to retained earnings might give rise to unwarranted differences across income numbers of adjusting and nonadjusting firms. Researchers of financial markets, meanwhile, have generated a body of evidence showing that markets set security prices using an information set broader than, and superior to, accounting measurements of net income. This evidence suggests that markets are capable of pricing securities efficiently even if adjustments to retained earnings {{have given rise to}} unwarranted differences across income numbers. ^ This dissertation compared cumulative market returns observed in the two years after adjustments to retained earnings with contemporary changes in net income that were not attributable to economy and industry effects. Independent comparisons were performed with 1, 026 observations associated with seven types of adjustments. On the assumption that markets do price securities efficiently, the comparisons may provide a basis for judging, normatively, the appropriateness of post-adjustment income numbers. ^ These comparisons provided evidence of (1) full compatibility following adjustments for compensated absences and for SFAS No. 52 foreign <b>currency</b> <b>translation,</b> (2) partial compatibility following adjustments for oil and gas exploration and events of prior period, and (3) incompatibility following adjustments for lease commitments, poolings of interests, and SFAS No. 8 foreign <b>currency</b> <b>translation.</b> ^ The results of these comparisons appeared to support three major conclusions: First, the security returns generated by efficient financial markets may be useful as a basis for evaluating the relevance of alternative measurements of net income. Second, compatibility between market returns and income numbers probably cannot be achieved until accounting policy makers adopt the concept of 2 ̆ 2 comprehensive income. 2 ̆ 2 Third, the poolings of interests method of accounting for certain business combinations may create a conflict between interests of managers and shareholders, and that conflict may be sufficiently serious as to justify the method 2 ̆ 7 s termination. ...|$|E

The empirical data consisted of eighty-four US GAAP reconciliations of income statements and shareholders' equity, disclosed in Swedish annual reports during 1981 - 90.

However, the empirical analysis of profits and return on equity provided little support for this hypothesis. Instead, there were indications of a less conservative accounting treatment in the Swedish accounts compared with US GAAP.

The validity of these methodological claims is indirectly being examined in this paper, which argues predominantly from an empirical angle.

40|$|For some time, {{there has}} been a push towards the {{harmonisation}} of accounting standards throughout the world. Given international trade in corporate securities and the growth of multinational companies, the harmonisation of accounting standards is clearly desirable. However, as this paper shows, full harmonisation is unlikely to be achieved. The {{reason for this is that}} accounting standards are not merely technical rules. They have economic consequences and, thereby, have political implications for both the preparers and users of financial statements. The fact that economic conditions vary from country to country, means that accounting methods that are acceptable in one country may not be acceptable in another.
