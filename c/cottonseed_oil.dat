40|$|The {{presence}} of lysigenous cavities filled with terpenoid aldehydes (generically termed 2 ̆ 7 gossypol 2 ̆ 7) in most tissues of cultivated cottons {{and their relatives}} imparts natural resistance {{to a variety of}} insect, fungal, and bacterial pests. Deposition of terpenoid aldehydes in cultivated cotton seed, however, tenders <b>cottonseed</b> <b>oils</b> and protein meals toxic to non- ruminant animals, including humans. Seeds of the so-called 2 ̆ 7 glandless seeded 2 ̆ 7 Australian Gossypium L. species (Gossypium subgenus Sturtia (R. Br.)

Information supporting this assertion, however, is fragmentary and contradictory. To resolve this, seeds of all known Australian Gossypium species were surveyed chemically and anatomically. Immature lysigenous cavities were present in seeds of all 18 species. Lysigenous cavities of sect. Sturtia and sect. Hibiscoidea Tod. seeds were unpigmented and invisible to the naked eye, while pigmented, macroscopically visible lysigenous cavities occurred in all the sect. Grandicalyx (Fryxell) Fryxell seeds.

25|$|When he was 19, Wharton apprenticed with an {{accountant}} {{for two years}} and became proficient in business methods and bookkeeping. At 21, he partnered with his older brother Rodman to start a business manufacturing white lead. Wharton's chemistry mentor, Martin Boye, had developed a method to refine <b>cottonseed</b> <b>oil</b> and the Wharton brothers tried but failed to develop a profitable method to extract it. In 1849 Wharton started a business manufacturing bricks using a patented machine which pressed dry clay into forms. There was substantial competition in the brick business, which was affected by cyclical business swings, and after several trips to sell bricks and the brick-making machines, Wharton found the prospects for making good profits were dim. However, from the endeavor he gained valuable experience. In 1853, Wharton joined the Pennsylvania and Lehigh Zinc Company near Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, first managing the mining operation and later the zinc oxide works. Wharton proved himself by negotiating a new charter for the works, and in the difficult financial environment of 1857–1858 he took over control of the zinc works, managing it carefully so that it turned a profit. In 1860 Wharton, after some challenging negotiations with the directors of the company, developed for Lehigh Zinc the first plant to manufacture metallic zinc in America. Looking into the next business cycle, he leased the plant for four years and eventually made a robust profit from the sale of metallic zinc, used in making brass, which picked up in the Civil War years.|$|E

30|$|Rudolph diesel has first {{tested the}} engine {{by using the}} peanut oil and {{discovered}} that the vegetable oils can serve as engine fuels after further treatment. Edible oils commonly used as feedstock for the biodiesel production have been soybean, canola, corn, coconut, palm tree, rapeseed, rice bran, sunflower, safflower, camelina and <b>cottonseed</b> <b>oils</b> to just name a few. Among these, soybean oil is the dominant feedstock and palm tree produces highest quantity of oils per cultivated area [79, 80]. Rapeseed and sunflower oils are predominant in the European Union. Although use of vegetable oils to prepare biodiesel was well received in the early stage, soon it turned out be a food versus fuel issue.

40|$|Cottonseed is a {{good source}} of high quality meal and edible oil. However, it {{contains}} a toxic phenolic compound called gossypol.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to estimate the level of gossypol in oil and ghee (Hydrogenated oil) samples from local markets so that awareness can be created regarding maintenance of minimum gossypol level in edible oils. During this study gossypol was extracted from cottonseeds and cotton seed cake using different organic solvents. The compound was detected in extracts by applying Chromatographic technique as well as chemical tests with SbCl 3, Pb(CH 3 COO) 2 and SnCl 3.

Canola oil is lower in saturated fats, and higher in monounsaturates and is a better source of omega-3 fats than other popular oils.

5000|$|<b>Cottonseed</b> <b>oil</b> {{then began}} to be used {{illegally}} to fortify animal fats and lards. Initially, meat packers secretly added <b>cottonseed</b> <b>oil</b> to the pure fats, but this practice was uncovered in 1884. Armour and Company, an American meatpacking and food processing company, sought to corner the lard market and realized that it had purchased more lard than the existing hog population could have produced. A congressional investigation followed, and legislation was passed that required products fortified with <b>cottonseed</b> <b>oil</b> to be labeled as ‘‘lard compound.” Similarly, <b>cottonseed</b> <b>oil</b> was often blended with olive oil. Once the practice was exposed, many countries put import tariffs on American olive oil and Italy banned the product completely in 1883. Both of these regulatory schemes depressed <b>cottonseed</b> <b>oil</b> sales and exports, once again creating an oversupply of <b>cottonseed</b> <b>oil,</b> which decreased its value. It was cottonseed's depressed value that led a newly formed Procter & Gamble to utilize its oil. The Panic of 1837 caused the two brothers-in-law to merge their candlestick and soap manufacturing businesses {{in an effort to}} minimize costs and weather the bear market. Looking for a replacement for expensive animal fats in production, the brothers finally settled on <b>cottonseed</b> <b>oil.</b> Procter & Gamble cornered the <b>cottonseed</b> <b>oil</b> market to circumvent the meat packer's monopoly on the price. But as electricity emerged, the demand for candles decreased. Procter and Gamble then found an edible use for <b>cottonseed</b> <b>oil.</b> Through patented technology, the brothers were able to hydrogenate <b>cottonseed</b> <b>oil</b> and develop a substance that closely resembled lard. In 1911, Procter & Gamble launched an aggressive marketing campaign to publicize its new product, Crisco, a vegetable shortening {{that could be used in}} place of lard. Crisco placed ads in major newspapers advertising that the product was [...] "easier on digestion...a healthier alternative to cooking with animal fats[...] [...] and more economical than butter.” The company also gave away free cookbooks, with every recipe calling for Crisco. By the 1920s the company developed cookbooks for specific ethnicities in their native tongues. Additionally, Crisco starting airing radio cooking programs. Similarly, in 1899 David Wesson, a food chemist, developed deodorized <b>cottonseed</b> <b>oil,</b> Wesson cooking oil. Wesson Oil also was marketed heavily and became quite popular too.|$|E

40|$|Herbs {{have been}} used in {{medicines}} and cosmetics from centuries. Their potential to treat different skin diseases, to adorn and improve the skin appearance is well-known. As ultraviolet (UV) radiation can cause sunburns, wrinkles, lower immunity against infections, premature aging, and cancer, there is permanent need for protection from UV radiation and prevention from their side effects. Herbs and herbal preparations have a high potential due to their antioxidant activity, primarily. Antioxidants such as vitamins (vitamin C, vitamin E), flavonoids, and phenolic acids play the main role in fighting against free radical species that are the main cause of numerous negative skin changes. Although isolated plant compounds have a high potential in protection of the skin, whole herbs extracts showed better potential due to their complex composition. Many studies showed that green and black tea (polyphenols) ameliorate adverse skin reactions following UV exposure. The gel from aloe is believed to stimulate skin and assist in new cell growth. Spectrophotometer testing indicates that as a concentrated extract of Krameria triandra it absorbs 25 to 30 % of the amount of UV radiation typically absorbed by octyl methoxycinnamate.
