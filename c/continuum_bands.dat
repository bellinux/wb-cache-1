We report a detailed comparison of lamp performance for both pulsed and sinusoidal voltage excitation waveforms, using otherwise identical operating conditions. The results show that pulsed voltage excitation yields a ~ 50 % increase in the overall electrical to EUV conversion efficiency compared with sinusoidal waveforms, when operating in the pressure range 500 – 900 mbar.

40|$|Time variabilities of {{the broad}} and skewed feature around 5 - 7 keV (so called “disk-line feature”) {{observed}} from the Seyfert galaxy, MCG- 6 - 30 - 15 were studied based on the ASCA long observation of this source in 1999. The RMS variability, defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean for a sequence of X-ray counts in a time bin, was calculated {{as a function of}} energy, with changing the width of the time bin. An interesting finding is that the RMS variability in the disk-line energy band (5. 0 - 6. 6 keV) decreases more largely than those in the other energy bands as the bin width increases from-lo 4 s to-lo 5 s. This variability decrease in the 5. 0 - 6. 6 keV band in association with the bin-width increase is consistent with a presence of a random variation of the flux on a time scale around lo 4 s. Whereas, the RMS variabilities in the <b>continuum</b> <b>bands</b> other than 5. 0 - 6. 6 keV do not decrease so largely as in 5. 0 - 6. 6 keV. This suggests a presence of another time variation on a time scale longer than 10 ” s, which appears only in the <b>continuum</b> <b>bands</b> other than the disk-line band. This energy-dependent time variation could be interpreted by introducing a time variation of absorption on a time scale longer than lo 5 s.

On 1996 June 18, {{in the midst of}} this intensive monitoring period, we obtained a high signal-to-noise snapshot of the UV spectrum from 1150 - 3300 A using the FOS on HST. This spectrum allows us to disentangle the UV continuum more accurately from the broad wings of the emission lines, to identify clean continuum windows free of contaminating emission and absorption, and to deblend line complexes such as Lya+NV, CIV+HeII+OIII], SiIII]+CIII], and MgII+FeII. Using the FOS spectrum as a template, we have fit and extracted line and continuum fluxes from the IUE monitoring data. The cleaner continuum extractions confirm the discovery of time delays between the different UV <b>continuum</b> <b>bands</b> by Wanders et al. Our new measurements show delays increasing with wavelength for <b>continuum</b> <b>bands</b> centered at 1485 A, 1740 A and 1825 A relative to 1315 A with delays of 0. 09, 0. 28 and 0. 36 days, respectively. Like many other Seyfert 1 galaxies, the UV spectrum of NGC 7469 shows intrinsic, blue-shifted absorption in Lya, NV and C IV. Soft X-ray absorption is also visible in archival ASCA X-ray spectra. The strength of the UV absorption, however, is not compatible with a single-zone model in which the same material absorbs both the UV and X-ray light. Similar to other Seyfert galaxies such as NGC 3516, the UV-absorbing gas in NGC 7469 has a lower ionization parameter and column density than the X-ray absorbing material. While the UV and X-ray absorption does not arise in the same material, the frequent occurrence of both associated UV absorption and X-ray warm absorbers in the same galaxies suggests that the gas supply for each has a common origin.

Moreover, the centers of the source regions of the red, green, and blue wavelengths of the white-light emissions are significantly displaced from each other, suggesting that those respective emissions are emanating from progressively lower heights in the solar atmosphere. The temperature distribution was also calculated from the white-light data, and we found the lower-layer emission to have a higher temperature.

40|$|We use {{the method}} of Press, Rybicki & Hewitt (1992) to search for time lags and time leads between {{different}} energy bands of the RXTE data for MCG- 6 - 30 - 15. We tailor our search in order to probe any reverberation signatures of the fluorescent iron Kalpha line that is thought to arise from the inner regions of the black hole accretion disk. In essence, an optimal reconstruction algorithm {{is applied to the}} <b>continuum</b> <b>band</b> (2 - 4 keV) light curve which smoothes out noise and interpolates across the data gaps. The reconstructed <b>continuum</b> <b>band</b> light curve can then be folded through trial transfer functions in an attempt to find lags or leads between the <b>continuum</b> <b>band</b> and the iron line band (5 - 7 keV). We find reduced fractional variability in the line band. The spectral analysis of Lee et al. (1999) reveals this to be due to a combination of an apparently constant iron line flux (at least on timescales of few x 10 ^ 4 s), and flux correlated changes in the photon index. We also find no evidence for iron line reverberation and exclude reverberation delays in the range 0. 5 - 50 ksec. This extends the conclusions of Lee et al. and suggests that the iron line flux remains constant on timescales as short as 0. 5 ksec. The large black hole mass (> 10 ^ 8 Msun) naively suggested by the constancy of the iron line flux is rejected on other grounds. We suggest that the black hole in MCG- 6 - 30 - 15 has a mass of M_BH~ 10 ^ 6 - 10 ^ 7 Msun and that changes in the ionization state of the disk may produce the puzzling spectral variability. Finally, it is found that the 8 - 15 keV band lags the 2 - 4 keV band by 50 - 100 s. This result is used to place constraints on the size and geometry of the Comptonizing medium responsible for the hard X-ray power-law in this AGN. Comment: 11 pages, 13 postscript figures.

Most of our photometry and spectrophotometry is measured from the same region of each galaxy, and our spectrophotometry has been validated with SDSS photometry, so our random and systematic errors are small relative to the intrinsic scatter seen in star formation rate indicator calibrations.

Likewise, the optical <b>continuum</b> <b>bands</b> (3590 ˚A and 5510 ˚A) were also strongly correlated with no measurable lag to 3 σ limits of ∼ < 0. 15 d. However, the optical and X-ray light curves showed very different behavior, and no significant correlation or simple relationship could be found. These results appear difficult to reconcile with previous reports of correlations between X-ray and optica...|$|E
40|$|Atomic-scale helices {{exist as}} motifs for several {{material}} lattices. We examine a tight-binding {{model for a}} single one-dimensional monatomic chain with a p-orbital basis coiled into a helix. A topologically nontrivial phase emerging from this model supports a zero-energy mode localized to a boundary, always embedded within a <b>continuum</b> <b>band,</b> regardless of termination site. We identify a topological invariant for this phase that {{is related to the}} number of zero energy end modes by means of the bulk-boundary correspondence, and give strict conditions for the existence of the bound state. Another, non-topological, gapped edge mode in the model spectrum has practical consequences for surface states in e. g. trigonal tellurium and selenium and other van der Waals-bonded one-dimensional semiconductors...|$|R
40|$|We present {{detailed}} {{measurement of}} the non-hydrodynamic part of the spin excitation spectrum in the model quasi- 1 D S= 1 antiferromagnet CsNiCl 3 by inelastic magnetic neutron scattering. In {{the better part of}} the Brillouin zone the effect of the inter-chain coupling is negligible, and spin dynamics reflects that of a single Haldane chain. We find that at q ~< 0. 6 pi this quantum spin system ceases to support coherent propagating excitation, which gradually turns into a <b>continuum</b> <b>band</b> of states, whose width grows with decreasing q. This finding is consistently verified under different resolution conditions, obtained with two different high-luminosity experimental setups.

40|$|We report pressure-dependent {{transient}} picosecond and continuous-wave photomodulation {{studies of}} disordered and ordered films of 2 -methoxy- 5 -(2 -ethylhexyloxy) poly(para-phenylenevinylene). Photoinduced absorption (PA) bands in the disordered film exhibit very weak pressure dependence and {{are assigned to}} intrachain excitons and polarons. In contrast, the ordered film exhibits two additional transient PA bands in the midinfrared that blueshift dramatically with pressure. Based on high-order configuration interaction calculations we ascribe the PA bands in the ordered film to excimers. Our work brings insight to the exciton binding energy in ordered films versus disordered films and solutions. The reduced exciton binding energy in ordered films is due to new energy states appearing below the <b>continuum</b> <b>band</b> threshold of the single strand. Comment: 5. 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
