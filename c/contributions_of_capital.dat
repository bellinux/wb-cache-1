Evidence on TFP determinants suggests that,besides cyclical factors, TFP growth reflects the impact of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms. The interaction of both factors in TFP behavior is worth noting. Evidence suggests also that, under conditions of high macroeconomic instability, the effects of a structural reform on TFP are smaller, and vice versa.

40|$|Should we use ex post or ex ante {{measures}} of user costs {{to calculate the}} <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> in a growth accounting exercise? The answer, based on a simple model of temporary equilibrium, is that ex post is better in theory.

In general, the ex post rate of return differs between assets, even though ex ante it is the same. I propose a hybrid method.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} dynamic <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> accumulation, globalisation, and {{financialisation}} to the functional-personal income distribution nexus. We analyse the labour share under the prism of monopoly and frictional growth, and disclose the dramatic upward trend in inequality. On this basis, we estimate a two-equation model for the income distribution in the US over the 1960 - 2009 period. We show that the labour share is affected positively by capital intensity and negatively by trade, while the Gini statistic is fueled by the falling labour share and increasing financial payments. Using counterfactual simulations, a key finding is that the decrease in capital intensity in the eighties accounted for about 76 % of the labour share fall, while its increase in the 2000 s prevented inequality from worsening three times more than it actually did.
