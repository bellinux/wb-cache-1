40|$|Our task is not {{to record}} history but to change it. (K. Marx (paraphrased)) How should Accelerator Physicists set magnet error specifications?

The Magnet Division then goes away for a suitably lengthy period of time, and comes back with a working magnet prototype that is reproduced in industry. A better solution is to set no specifications.

Damaging harmonics are traded off against innocuous harmonics as the prototype design evolves, lagging one generation behind the evolution of expected harmonics. Finally, the real harmonics are quickly evaluated during early industrial production, allowing a final round of performance trade-offs, using contingency scenarios prepared earlier.

Methods: We retrospectively studied 653 participants (788 knees) who elected to undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between September 2005 and December 2010.

Multinomial logistic regression was used to predict the risk of lower extremity alignment deformity from POSTTFA and <b>component</b> <b>alignment</b> angles. Results: The predictive accuracy of the linear regression models to estimate POSTMA from PRETFA and POSTTFA was 4 % and 22 %, respectively. Nearly 100 % of the knees with actual neutral POSTMA of 0 º ± 3 º were accurately predicted to have a POSTMA of 0 º ± 3 º. There were zero knees with actual varus or valgus alignment over 3 º that were accurately predicted to have a POSTMA over 3 º of varus or valgus.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the accuracy of extramedullary and intramedullary tibial cutting guides used in indigenous and imported implants respectively, in positioning of the tibial components in megaprosthetic knee replacements. Methods A comparative study of the accuracy of extramedullary and intramedullary tibial cutting guides was carried out in 92 megaprosthetic knee replacements for distal femoral tumors. For the proximal tibia cut for tibial component placement, an extramedullary guide was used in 65 patients and an intramedullary guide was used in 27 patients. Tibial <b>component</b> <b>alignment</b> angles were measured in postoperative X-rays with the help of CAD software. Results There was more varus placement in coronal plane with extramedullary cutting guide (− 1. 18 +/− 2. 4 degrees) than the intramedullary guide (− 0. 34 +/− 2. 31 degrees) but this did not reach statistical significance. The goal of 90 +/− 2 degrees alignment of tibial component was achieved in 54 % of patients in the extramedullary group versus 67 % in the intramedullary group. In terms of sagittal plane alignment, extramedullary guide showed less accurate results (2. 09 +/− 2. 4 degrees) than intramedullary guide (0. 50 +/− 3. 80 degrees) for tibial <b>component</b> <b>alignment,</b> though 78 % of patients were aligned within the goal of 0 – 5 degrees of tibial slope angle in extramedullary group versus 63 % in intramedullary group. The mean error in the measurements due to rotation of the knee during taking the X-rays was less than 0. 1 degrees and distribution of the X-rays with the rotation of knee was similar in both the groups. Conclusions Overall, in megaprosthetic knee replacement intramedullary guides gave more accurate results in sagittal plane and exhibited similar variability as of extramedullary guides in coronal plane. </p...|$|E

40|$|We perform SPH {{simulations}} {{to study}} precession {{and changes in}} alignment between the circumprimary disc and the binary orbit in misaligned binary systems. We find that the precession process can be described by the rigid-disc approximation, where the disc is considered as a rigid body interacting with the binary companion only gravitationally. Precession also causes change in alignment between the rotational axis of the disc and the spin axis of the primary star. This type of alignment is of great important for explaining the origin of spin-orbit misaligned planetary systems. However, {{we find that the}} rigid-disc approximation fails to describe changes in alignment between the disc and the binary orbit. This is because the alignment process is a consequence of interactions that involve the fluidity of the disc, such as the tidal interaction and the encounter interaction. Furthermore, simulation results show that there are not only alignment processes, which bring the <b>components</b> towards <b>alignment,</b> but also anti-alignment processes, which tend to misalign the <b>components.</b> The <b>alignment</b> process dominates in systems with misalignment angle near 90 °, while the anti-alignment process dominates in systems with the misalignment angle near 0 ° or 180 °.

40|$|Loosening of the glenoid {{component}} {{has been}} cited as the most frequent cause of patient dissatisfaction with total shoulder arthroplasty, {{and it has been}} demonstrated in clinical studies that misalignment of the prostheses can be a causative factor. Finite element analyses of five different glenoid <b>component</b> <b>alignments</b> (central, anteverted, retroverted, inferiorly inclined, and superiorly inclined) were conducted in order to predict changes in the survivability of the cement mantle surrounding the glenoid component. The potential for mechanical failure of the mantle in the centrally aligned implant, during unloaded abduction, was seen to be lower than for any other alignment. Normal bone outperformed simulated rheumatoid models in all cases. Retroversion was worse than anteversion, and superoinferior misalignment was worse than anteroposterior. The quality of the supporting bone stock was found to be particularly significant to cement survivability, more so than the occurrence of eccentric loading of the joint. Shear forces acting on the glenoid component were found to be more detrimental than axial forces, resulting in a greater likelihood of failure toward the extremes of motion.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{majority}} of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) systems use extramedullary alignment guides for tibial component placement. However, at least 1 system offers intramedullary referencing. In total knee arthroplasty, {{studies suggest that}} tibial component placement is more accurate with intramedullary referencing. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the accuracy of extramedullary referencing with intramedullary referencing for tibial component placement in total ankle arthroplasty. METHODS: The coronal and sagittal tibial <b>component</b> <b>alignment</b> was evaluated on the postoperative weight-bearing anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs of 236 consecutive fixed-bearing TAAs. Radiographs were measured blindly by 2 investigators. The postoperative alignment of the prosthesis was compared with the surgeon's intended alignment in both planes. The accuracy of tibial <b>component</b> <b>alignment</b> was compared between the extramedullary and intramedullary referencing techniques using unpaired t tests. Interrater and intrarater reliabilities were assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS: Eighty-three tibial components placed with an extramedullary referencing technique were compared with 153 implants placed with an intramedullary referencing technique. The accuracy of the extramedullary referencing was within a mean of 1. 5 ± 1. 4 degrees and 4. 1 ± 2. 9 degrees in the coronal and sagittal planes, respectively. The accuracy of intramedullary referencing was within a mean of 1. 4 ± 1. 1 degrees and 2. 5 ± 1. 8 degrees in the coronal and sagittal planes, respectively. There was a significant difference (P <. 001) between the 2 techniques with respect to the sagittal plane alignment. Interrater ICCs for coronal and sagittal alignment were high (0. 81 and 0. 94, respectively). Intrarater ICCs for coronal and sagittal alignment were high for both investigators. CONCLUSIONS: Initial sagittal plane tibial <b>component</b> <b>alignment</b> was notably more accurate when intramedullary referencing was used.
