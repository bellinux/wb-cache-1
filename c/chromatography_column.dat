25|$|One of the {{applications}} of imidazole {{is in the}} purification of His-tagged proteins in immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Imidazole is used to elute tagged proteins bound to nickel ions attached {{to the surface of}} beads in the <b>chromatography</b> <b>column.</b> An excess of imidazole is passed through the column, which displaces the His-tag from nickel coordination, freeing the His-tagged proteins.|$|E
25|$|The {{mobile phase}} is the phase that moves in a {{definite}} direction. It {{may be a}} liquid (LC and Capillary Electrochromatography (CEC)), a gas (GC), or a supercritical fluid (supercritical-fluid chromatography, SFC). The mobile phase consists of the sample being separated/analyzed and the solvent that moves the sample through the column. In the case of HPLC the mobile phase consists of a non-polar solvent(s) such as hexane in normal phase or a polar solvent such as methanol in reverse phase chromatography and the sample being separated. The mobile phase moves through the <b>chromatography</b> <b>column</b> (the stationary phase) where the sample interacts with the stationary phase and is separated.|$|E

500|$|For natural proteins, {{a series}} of {{purification}} steps {{may be necessary to}} obtain protein sufficiently pure for laboratory applications. To simplify this process, genetic engineering is often used to add chemical features to proteins that make them easier to purify without affecting their structure or activity. Here, a [...] "tag" [...] consisting of a specific amino acid sequence, often {{a series of}} histidine residues (a [...] "His-tag"), is attached to one terminus of the protein. As a result, when the lysate is passed over a <b>chromatography</b> <b>column</b> containing nickel, the histidine residues ligate the nickel and attach to the column while the untagged components of the lysate pass unimpeded. A number of different tags have been developed to help researchers purify specific proteins from complex mixtures.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} reagents {{which can be used}} to label terminal amino acids. They all react with amine groups and will therefore also bind to amine groups in the side chains of amino acids such as lysine - for this reason it is necessary to be careful in interpreting chromatograms to ensure that the right spot is chosen. Two of the more common reagents are Sanger's reagent (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) and dansyl derivatives such as dansyl chloride. Phenylisothiocyanate, the reagent for the Edman degradation, can also be used. The same questions apply here as in the determination of amino acid composition, with the exception that no stain is needed, as the reagents produce coloured derivatives and only qualitative analysis is required. [...] So the amino acid {{does not have to be}} eluted from the <b>chromatography</b> <b>column,</b> just compared with a standard. Another consideration to take into account is that, since any amine groups will have reacted with the labelling reagent, ion exchange chromatography cannot be used, and thin layer chromatography or high-pressure liquid chromatography should be used instead.|$|E

50|$|The {{compounds}} {{are produced}} using a proprietary purification technology called Sample Displacement Chromatography (SDC). The technique exploits {{the correlation between}} molecular weight and binding strength of PEG species. That is, individual PEG molecules bind to the matrix within a <b>chromatography</b> <b>column</b> at differing affinity depending on their molecular weight. Because of this property, when PEG {{is applied to the}} top of a <b>chromatography</b> <b>column,</b> strong binding species take possession of the first binding positions available and thereby force weaker binders to follow the liquid flow down the column to the next vacant positions. This results in the spatial separation of PEG species within the column according to affinity and thereby molecular weight.|$|E

40|$|<b>Chromatography</b> <b>columns</b> {{have been}} {{traditionally}} packed with support particles. Novel monolithic chromatography systems were fabricated using microlithographic technology. <b>Chromatography</b> <b>columns</b> and other peripheral {{components of the}} chromatography systems were all in situ microfabricated using deep reactive ion etching on the same microchip. This thesis describes the architectural design, fabrication, and evaluation of their performance. ^ These microfabricated <b>chromatography</b> <b>columns</b> are based on collocated monolith support structures (COMOSS). COMOSS-based <b>chromatography</b> <b>columns</b> allow {{a great deal of}} freedom in design and selection of channel size, shape, and spatial distribution. The performance of COMOSS-based columns was clearly demonstrated with a 18 nL column made of 5 x 5 x 10 μm COMOSS separated by rectangular channels 1. 5 μm wide and 10 μm deep. ^ A collocated monolith distributor (COMOD) and collocated monolith collector (COMOC) for COMOSS column were also fabricated together with the column in the same microchip. Discontinuity of mobile phase flow velocity and stagnant pools of mobile phase were effectively controlled in these modules. The COMOD and COMOC were about 150 μm longitudinal length and 60 pL in volume. Several column coupling structures, fluid turning connectors (FTC), serial column coupling structures (SCCS) and parallel column coupling structures (PCCS), are also described. Their application facilitated the integrated design of multiple parallel columns. A 100 pL static mixer was designed to achieve complete mixing of solvents and reagents in a path length of approximately 200 μm. Finally, these microfluidic analytical systems were protected from particle clogging using a filter in situ micromachined at the system inlets and outlets in the microchip. ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{a liquid}} {{chromatography}} experiment, for example, an analyte is generally adsorbed, or [...] "bound to", an adsorbent in a liquid <b>chromatography</b> <b>column.</b> The adsorbent, a solid phase (stationary phase), is a powder which is coated onto a solid support. Based on an adsorbent's composition, {{it can have}} varying affinities to [...] "hold" [...] onto other molecules—forming a thin film on its surface. Elution then {{is the process of}} removing analytes from the adsorbent by running a solvent, called an [...] "eluent", past the adsorbent/analyte complex. As the solvent molecules [...] "elute", or travel down through the <b>chromatography</b> <b>column,</b> they can either pass by the adsorbent/analyte complex or they can displace the analyte by binding to the adsorbent in its place. After the solvent molecules displace the analyte, the analyte can be carried out of the column for analysis. This is why as the mobile phase passes out of the column, it typically flows into a detector or is collected for compositional analysis.|$|E
