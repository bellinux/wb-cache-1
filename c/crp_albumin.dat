40|$|Abstract Background Cachexia is a {{state of}} {{involuntary}} weight loss common to many chronic diseases. Experimental data, showing that cachexia is related to the enhancement of acute phase response reaction, led to the new definition of cachexia that included, aside from the principal criterion of weight loss, other “minor criteria”, Amongst them are levels of C-reactive protein (<b>CRP),</b> <b>albumin</b> and hemoglobin. However, there is paucity of data regarding possible differences of these laboratory parameters in patients with various diseases known to be related to cachexia. Methods <b>CRP,</b> <b>albumin</b> and hemoglobin were evaluated in 119 patients, divided into two disease groups, hematological (ones with diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin disease) and non-hematological (solid tumor patients and patients with chronic heart failure). Patients were further subdivided into two nutritional groups, cachectic and non-cachectic ones according to the principal criterion for cacxehia i. e. loss of body weight. Results We found that cachectic patients had higher levels of CRP, and lower levels of both hemoglobin and albumin compared to non-cachectic patients, regardless of the disease group they fitted. On the other hand, the group of hematological patients had lower levels of CRP primarily due to the differences found in the non-cachectic group. Higher levels of albumin were also found in the hematological group regardless of the nutritional group they fitted. Limitations of cut-off values, proposed by definition, were found, mostly regarding their relatively low sensitivity and low negative predictive value. Conclusions As expected, differences in values of routine laboratory parameters used in definition of cachexia were found between cachectic and non-cachectic patients. Their values differed between hematological and non-hematological patients both in cachectic and non-cachectic group. Cut-off levels currently used in definition of cachexia have limitations and should be further evaluated. </p...|$|E

To determine sleep quality and its correlation with serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level in these patients, we studied 132 chronic HD patients in two university-affiliated teaching hospitals in Sari, Iran during September 2010. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was employed to assess the sleep quality of the patients in addition to <b>CRP,</b> <b>albumin,</b> cholesterol, phosphorus and hemoglobin levels. There were 104 (78. 7 %) patients who suffered from poor sleep quality. A significant correlation was found between serum CRP level and the patients′ sleep quality (P < 0. 05). There was also a significant correlation between sleep quality and serum phosphorus and albumin levels and body mass index (P < 0. 05). Furthermore, a significant positive correlation existed between the different components of sleep quality and CRP (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Auranofin, {{a member}} of a class of {{compounds}} with disease modifying activity, was given to arthritic rats to determine if it could reverse the abnormal plasma concentrations of fibronectin (Fn), C reactive protein (<b>CRP),</b> and <b>albumin,</b> which were unaffected by treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). When auranofin was orally administered for two weeks to adjuvant induced arthritic rats it significantly inhibited swelling of the injected and non-injected paws at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg. Rocket electroimmunoassay measurement of plasma proteins in normal, arthritic, and auranofin treated arthritic rats indicated that auranofin at 10 mg/kg significantly decreased (by 77 %) the abnormally high concentration of arthritic rat plasma Fn, though it had no effect on Fn concentrations when administered to normal rats. CRP, which was raised approximately twofold above normal in arthritic rats, was reduced by 56 % after treatment of arthritic rats with auranofin at 10 mg/kg, though CRP concentrations in normal rats were unaffected by auranofin treatment. Depressed albumin concentrations in arthritic rats were significantly enhanced (by 30 %) by dosing with 10 mg/kg of auranofin. At the 3 mg/kg dose, auranofin did not significantly change plasma concentrations of Fn, <b>CRP,</b> and <b>albumin</b> in arthritic rats. At a dose of 10 mg/kg, however, auranofin, in addition to inhibiting chronic systemic paw inflammation, also altered abnormal concentrations of plasma Fn, <b>CRP,</b> and <b>albumin</b> in the adjuvant arthritic rat, thus distinguishing auranofin from standard NSAIDs we have previously tested...|$|R

This study aimed to explore its value in pa-tients with relatively early stage colorectal cancer (CRC). A total of 99 CRC patients with stage II from 2005 to 2010 operated in our hospital were enrolled in this study. C-reactive protein (<b>CRP),</b> <b>albumin</b> (ALB), Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score as well as a variety of biochemical variables before the operation was acquired from the data-base retrospectively. The value of GPS was calculated and its association with the clinical factors was further inves-tigated. The prognostic significance was analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Increased preoperative GPS was found associated with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and decreasing of KPS. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test revealed that a higher GPS predicted a higher risk of postoperative mortality in stage II CRC (P < 0. 001). Furthermore, multivariate analysis demonstrated the GPS to be a risk factor for postoperative mortality (HR 3. 215; P= 0. 025).

MethodsTo explore the effects of CRP and normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) on serum albumin and creatinine, we analyzed six consecutive months of laboratory data from 364 hemodialysis patients, using a multivariable Mixed model with conservative biases. ResultsThe overall trend over time in serum albumin was slightly positive (0. 039 g/dL/month) and in serum creatinine slightly negative (- 0. 052 mg/dL/month). With increasing <b>CRP,</b> serum <b>albumin</b> declined significantly (- 0. 124 g/dL/month per unit increase in log CRP, adjusted for age, gender, race, diabetes, and nPCR, P < 0. 0001). Serum albumin increased with increasing nPCR (0. 021 g/dL/month per 0. 1 g/kg/day, P < 0. 0001). The effect of <b>CRP</b> on <b>albumin</b> was attenuated in African Americans and at a higher nPCR. Corresponding values for creatinine mirrored those for <b>albumin.</b> With increasing <b>CRP,</b> creatinine declined significantly [- 0. 142 mg/dL/month per unit increase in log CRP, adjusted for age, gender, race, diabetes (time since initiation of dialysis; vintage), Kt/V, and nPCR, P = 0. 002].

In multivariate analysis, taking into account age, gender, LNR, resection margins, tumour status, and adjuvant chemotherapy, the preoperative biomarkers independently associated with adverse prognosis were hypoalbuminemia (5 mg/L, HR 1. 44, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 2. 02, p = 0. 036), CEA (> 5 μg/L, HR 1. 60, 95 % CI 1. 07 - 2. 53, p = 0. 047), and CA 19 - 9 (≥ 555 kU/L, HR 1. 91, 95 % CI 1. 18 - 3. 08, p = 0. 008). For patients with resectable PDAC, preoperative CRP, along with albumin and tumour markers, is useful for predicting prognosis...|$|E
30|$|As Casadei Gardini reported, the serum CRP {{concentration}} {{alone is}} also {{significantly correlated with}} the survival (Casadei Gardini et al. 2016). We came {{to the same conclusion}} based on the findings in our previous study (Shibutani et al. 2015 b). However, Ranzani reported that the CRP/ALB ratio was more closely correlated with survival than the CRP values alone (Ranzani et al. 2013). By combining the <b>CRP</b> and <b>albumin</b> values, which have both been reported to be independent prognostic factors for various types of cancer, the CRP/ALB ratio is believed to be a more useful marker.|$|R
40|$|Serum amyloid P (SAP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are {{proteins}} {{involved in}} innate immunity. The expression of SAP and CRP is increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue, compared to healthy controls. Although both proteins {{are found in}} cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), their origin is unclear. We investigated if increased local production of SAP and CRP in AD brain results in higher levels in CSF {{with the use of}} index values. To study this, SAP, <b>CRP,</b> and <b>albumin</b> levels were determined in CSF and serum samples of 30 control (65 ± 11 years; 57 % female) and 140 AD subjects (65 ± 9 years; 53 % female). To correct for inter-individual differences in protein diffusion from blood to CSF, quotients (Q =CSF/serum) of SAP, <b>CRP,</b> and <b>albumin</b> and index values (Qprotein/Qalb) were calculated. The results showed no significant differences in SAP and CRP index values between control and AD subjects, although eight percent of individual AD patients showed evidence of intrathecal SAP or CRP production using the Reiber hyperbolic model. Interestingly, the SAP index value was much lower than expected, based on its molecular size. In conclusion, these data suggest that local production of SAP and CRP in the AD brain does not substantially contribute to the CSF levels. © 2010 - IOS Press and the authors.

40|$|Objective: Several {{inflammatory}} markers {{have been}} studied as potential biomarkers in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), however few reports have analyzed their prognostic value in aggregate and in non-clear cell histologies. We hypothesize {{that a combination of}} specific inflammatory markers into an RCC Inflammatory Score (RISK) could serve as a rigorous prognostic indicator of overall survival (OS) in patients with clear cell and non-clear cell RCC. Methods: Combination of preoperative C-reactive protein (<b>CRP),</b> <b>albumin,</b> erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), corrected calcium, and aspartate transaminase to alanine transaminase (AST/ALT) ratio was used to develop RISK. RISK was developed using grid-search methodology, receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis, and sensitivity-specificity trade-off analysis. Prognostic value of RISK was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method and Cox proportional regression models. Predictive accuracy was compared with RISK to Size, Size, Grade, and Necrosis (SSIGN) score, University of California-LOS Angeles (UCLA) Integrated Staging System (UISS), and Leibovich Prognosis Score (LPS). Results: Among 391 RCC patients treated with nephrectomy, area under the curve (AUC) for RISK was 0. 783, which was comparable to SSIGN (AUC 0. 776, p =  0. 82) and UISS (AUC 0. 809, p =  0. 317). Among patients with localized disease, AUC for RISK and LPS was 0. 742 and 0. 706, respectively (p =  0. 456). On multivariate analysis, we observed a step-wise statistically significant inverse relationship between increasing RISK group and OS (all p <  0. 001). Conclusion: RISK is an independent and significant predictor of OS for patients treated with nephrectomy for clear cell and non-clear cell RCC, with accuracy comparable to other histopathological prognostic tools...|$|E
40|$|Background: Perihilar cholangiocarcinoma {{has one of}} {{the poorest}} prognoses of all cancers. However, {{mortality}} and morbidity rates after surgical resection are 0 - 15 % and 14 - 66 %, respectively. Additionally, the 5 -year overall survival rates are reported at 22 - 40 %. These findings indicate that only selected patients achieve satisfactory beneficial effects from operative treatment. This retrospective study sought to investigate preoperatively available prognostic factors and establish a new preoperative staging system to predict survival after major hepatectomy of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. Patients and methods: We evaluated 121 consecutive patients who underwent operative exploration for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma. Results: Univariate and multivariate analysis using the identified preoperative factors revealed that 4 factors (platelet-lymphocyte ratio [PLR] > 150, serum C-reactive protein [CRP] levels > 0. 5 mg/dL, albumin levels 7. 0 ng/mL) were independent prognostic factors of postoperative survival. These 4 preoperative factors were allocated 1 point each. The total score was defined as the Preoperative Prognostic Score (PPS). Patients with a PPS of 0, 1, 2, or 3 / 4 had a 5 -year survival of 84. 3 %, 51. 3 %, 46. 4 %, and 0 %, respectively. There were also differences in the 5 -year survival according to the PPS (0 vs 1 [P =. 013] and 2 vs 3 / 4 [P <. 001]). Patients with a total PPS of 3 / 4 had a dismal prognosis, with a median survival of 11. 3 months. Conclusion: A new preoperative scoring system using PLR, serum <b>CRP,</b> <b>albumin,</b> and CEA levels could predict postoperative survival resection of perihilar cholangiocarcinoma...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. Every {{surgical}} procedure causes metabolic, endocrine, and hemodynamic {{stress in the}} organism. The aim of this work {{was to assess the}} extent of trauma following each of the two types of cholecystectomy (traditional/open and laparoscopic) by measuring palette of biochemical parameters. Methods. This prospective, single- center study included 120 patients subjected to elective cholecystectomy during the period of one year. Sixty patients were treated laparoscopically and 60 traditionally. Biohumoral and endocrine parameters were determined from 24 -hour urine and blood. We measured adrenaline, noradrenaline, metabolites of corticosteroid hormones (17 -hydroxyl and 17 -keto steroids), C-reactive protein (<b>CRP),</b> <b>albumin,</b> glycemia, creatine-phosphokinase (CPK), lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH), red blood cells sedimentation and serum concentration of potassium. Results. We observed significantly lower levels of adrenaline (p < 0. 01), noradrenaline (p < 0. 05), dopamine (p < 0. 01), 17 -hydroxyl (p < 0. 01) and 17 -keto steroids (p < 0. 01), glycemia (p < 0. 01), CPK (p < 0. 01), LDH (p < 0. 01) and red blood cells sedimentation (p < 0. 01) following laparoscopic cholecystectomy compared to traditional one. Significant increase in CRP levels was recorded postoperatively in both groups (p < 0. 05), as well as significant decrease in serum albumin values (p < 0. 05). Duration of the hospitalization following laparoscopic cholecystectomy was significantly shorter (p < 0. 01). Conclusion. The intensity of organism response is proportional to the intensity of surgical trauma. Metabolic, tissue and neuroendocrine response of organism to trauma has lower intensity after laparoscopic cholecystectomy...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) in patients with esophageal carcinoma (EC). METHODS: A total of 50 patients with EC were analyzed for GPS, nutritional and clinicopathologic parameters. Patients with CRP &# 8804; 1. 0 mg/L and albumin &# 8805; 3. 5 mg/L were considered as GPS= 0. Patients with only <b>CRP</b> increased or <b>albumin</b> decreased were classified as GPS= 1 and patients with CRP > 1. 0 mg/L and albumin < 3. 5 mg/L were considered as GPS= 2. RESULTS: GPS of 0, 1 and 2 were observed in seven, 23 and 20 patients, respectively. A significant inverse relationship was observed between GPS scores and the survival rate. The survival rate was greatest in patients with GPS= 0 and significantly higher than those from patients with GPS= 1 and GPS= 2. Minimum 12 -month survival was observed in 71 % patients with GPS= 0 and in 30 % patients with GPS= 1. None of the patients with GPS= 2 survived for 12 months. A significant relationship between <b>CRP</b> or <b>albumin</b> individually and the survival rate was observed. No significant relationship among nutritional, clinic pathological parameters and survival was found.

40|$|Protein- energy malnutrition, wasting and {{inflammation}} {{are frequent}} complication among patients with {{end-stage renal disease}} (ESRD). Malnutrition is associated with cardiac co-morbidity, inflammation and poor survival in ESRD patients. Serum albumin is a well-known marker of nutrition in ESRD patients. Serum albumin {{is still the most}} commonly used nutritional marker in ESRD patients. C-reactive protein (CRP), the major acute phase response (APR) protein is elevated in these patients. High CRP levels are linked to the degree of atherosclerosis in coronary, peripheral, and extracranial brain arteries. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate nutritional factor (<b>albumin)</b> and <b>CRP</b> levels in ESRD patients. In this cross- sectional study a total of 300 patients who had ESRD and had been on hemodialysis treatment for at least 6 months were selected. The laboratory tests consisted of measurement of <b>CRP</b> and <b>albumin</b> using high sensitive ELISA kits. The study patients included 157 males (52. 3 %) and 143 females (47. 7 %) with average age of 41. 5 ± 14. 3 years. Mean CRP level was 7. 96 mg/ dl (± 1. 52), mean serum albumin was 4. 07 g/dl (± 0. 19). Of 300 patients, 21 died (7 %). These were patients with serum albumin 9. 5 mg/dl. This study showed that low <b>albumin</b> and high <b>CRP</b> levels are the main predictors for death. There was a significant difference between <b>CRP</b> and <b>albumin</b> levels in ESRD patients (P< 0. 0001). Measuring CRP as a marker of inflammation can be helpful in managing these patients...|$|R
