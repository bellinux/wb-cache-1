5|$|Tonight: Franz Ferdinand (also {{known as}} Tonight) {{is the third}} studio album by Scottish indie rock band Franz Ferdinand. It was {{released}} on 26 January 2009 through Domino Records in the UK and Epic Records in the US. It was the band's first studio album since You <b>Could</b> <b>Have</b> <b>It</b> So Much Better (2005), released roughly {{three and a half}} years earlier.|$|E
5|$|I believe {{also two}} things. As I just said, {{there must be}} no imposition. Secondly, for an {{indefinite}} period – I {{do not know how}} long – I should have, I would have English as an associate, additional language which can be used not because of facilities and all that... but because I do not wish the people of Non-Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed to them because they are forced to correspond – the Government, I mean – in the Hindi language. They can correspond in English. So I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> as an alternate language as long as people require it and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E
5|$|After the Puerto Rican league season {{came to an}} end in 1932, Coimbre went to work as a {{security}} guard in a penal institution and only played with a semi-professional team. Shortly after, he was offered a contract to play in La Guaira, with a team called Santa Marta. The season concluded with Buchipluma, a second team owned by Santa Marta's proprietor winning the league's championship. Following his participation with Santa Marta, he continued playing, both in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. While playing with Licey, the team developed a rivalry with El Escogido, which gave Coimbre an opportunity to establish relationships with several players, from both countries. During this period the team continued to be coached by Dore, and included several known Dominican players. The team would win the league's championship once, but Coimbre decided not to assist the ceremony where the trophy was awarded choosing to stay in his hotel room instead. Dore took the cup to Coimbre so that he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> in his possession some days, but he rejected this and suggested that it be filled with money for a donation.|$|E

25|$|Odin said that, {{given how}} she {{obtained}} it, {{she would never}} get it back. That is, with one exception: she <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> back if she could make two kings, themselves ruling twenty kings each, battle one another, and cast a spell so that each time one of their numbers falls in battle, they will again spring up and fight again. And that this must go on eternally, unless a Christian man of a particular stature goes into the battle and smites them, only then will they stay dead. Freyja agreed.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{question}} has again been revived {{after many years}} of slumber, and business men in Quebec seem hopeful that something will come of it, though the placing of a subsidy on the statute book is but {{a small part of the}} work to be accomplished, as some of its enthusiastic promoters will, ere long, discover. Both Federal and Provincial Governments seem disposed to contribute towards the cost, and the City of Quebec will also be expected to do its share. Many of our people have objected to any contribution being given by the city unless the bridge is built opposite the town, and the CHRONICLE like every other good citizen of Quebec would prefer to see it constructed at Diamond Harbor, and has contended in the interests of the city for this site as long as there seemed to be any possibility of securing it there. It would still do so if it appeared that our people <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> at that site. A bridge at Diamond Harbor would, it estimated, cost at least eight millions. It would be very nice to have, with its double track, electric car track, and roads for vehicles and pedestrians, and would no doubt create a goodly traffic between the two towns, and be one of the show works of the continent.|$|E

According {{to a report in}} June 1916 by the German {{ambassador}} stationed in Constantinople, the goods of the Armenians [...] "have long since been confiscated, and their capital has been liquidated by a so-called commission, which means that if an Armenian owned a house valued at, say, £T100, a Turk – a friend or member [...] – <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> for around £T2." ...|$|E

500|$|Justice Antonin Scalia {{issued a}} very short dissenting opinion. Scalia noted that, while he joined Sotomayor’s dissent, he {{disagreed}} with her suggestion that here “literalness may strangle meaning”. [...] He goes on to opine the phrase [...] "continued custody" [...] could refer to [...] "custody in the future"– in other words, even if the biological father had no custody of {{the child in the}} past, he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> in the future, and therefore USC §1912(f) would still apply. Scalia also noted that biological parents also had legal rights {{and that there was no}} reason in law or policy to dilute those rights.|$|E
500|$|The song's meaning {{originated}} {{with a discussion}} between Brandon Heath and friend and songwriter Jason Ingram. [...] "We had a conversation over Chinese food that we wished we could have God’s perspective on things", Heath said. [...] "If we did have His perspective, we'd wish we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> {{for long periods of}} time, rather than just for a few seconds. That was the beginning." [...] He soon began to pen a song about the idea, co-writing [...] "Give Me Your Eyes" [...] with Ingram. Prior to recording What If We, Heath had written 40 possible tracks for the album, and although the song was not his top favorite, he noted that [...] "Give Me Your Eyes" [...] was [...] "one of the first that really stuck out." ...|$|E
500|$|The album had a {{significant}} chart performance. It debuted at number two on the UK Album Chart, as well as number nine on the Billboard 200 in the U.S., selling about 31,000 copies in its first week of release. The album, however, suffered a fifty-place decline on the Billboard 200 from #9 to #59 in its second week on the chart. The album also charted in the top ten in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, and Switzerland. The album had a chart performance similar to their second studio album, You <b>Could</b> <b>Have</b> <b>It</b> So Much Better, which also charted in the top ten in several countries. In 2009. It was awarded a gold certification from the Independent Music Companies Association which indicated sales of at least 100,000 copies throughout Europe.|$|E

500|$|Titterton was the Dean of the Research School of Physical Sciences from 1966 to 1968, and Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences from 1969 to 1973. He {{was also}} a member of the council of Macquarie University from 1978 to 1984. His goal was to build up the physics {{department}} at ANU into a world-class institution. When he heard that the 33 MeV electron synchrotron at the Telecommunications Research Establishment in Malvern, Worcestershire, was to be closed down, he wrote to Cockcroft, now the director of the AERE, and asked if he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> for the ANU. Cockcroft agreed, on condition that the ANU pay for it to be dismantled and shipped all the way to Australia. Titterton arranged for this to be done. The electron synchrotron was installed in the basement of the Oliphant Building, where it became known as [...] "Ernie's erection".|$|E
500|$|Mew is {{mentioned}} in Pokémon Red and Green in the Cinnabar Mansion, {{in a journal}} referencing that Mew is in Guyana. For a time, Mew could only be legitimately obtained in the Pokémon video games via Nintendo promotional event distributions. Mew was first revealed and {{made available to the}} public in the April 1996 issue of CoroCoro Comics. This issue offered a promotion called the [...] "Legendary Pokémon Offer", where 20 randomly selected entrants could send their cartridges in for Nintendo to add Mew to their games. At Nintendo promotional events soon after the release of Pokémon Red and Blue, players <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> downloaded to their games. This period ended with the release of My Pokémon Ranch, where Mew was accessible legitimately without an event distribution. Mew also appears as one of the Pokémon that can be released from the Poké Ball item in the Super Smash Bros. series. When sent out, it flies away from the stage, usually dropping rare items as it does so.|$|E
500|$|It {{is unclear}} when Kujau {{produced}} his first Hitler diary. Stiefel says Kujau {{gave him a}} diary on loan in 1975. Schulze puts the date as 1976, while Kujau says he began in 1978, after a month's practice writing in the old German gothic script Hitler had used. Kujau used one of a pile of notebooks he had bought cheaply in East Berlin, and attempted to put the letters [...] "AH" [...] in gold on the front—purchasing plastic, Hong Kong-made letters from a department store, he inadvertently used [...] "FH" [...] rather than [...] "AH". He took the black ribbon from a genuine SS document, and attached it to the cover using a German army wax seal. For the ink he bought two bottles of Pelikan ink—one black, one blue—and mixed them with water so it would flow more easily from the cheap modern pen he used. Finally he sprinkled tea over the pages and bashed the diaries against his desk {{to give them an}} aged look. Kujau showed the first volume to Stiefel, who was impressed and thought it a genuine Hitler diary; Stiefel wanted to buy it, but when the forger refused, the pair agreed that the collector <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> on loan.|$|E

2500|$|The Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans also popularized the drink, {{abetted by}} Governor Huey Long's fondness for it. [...] In July 1935, Long brought a {{bartender}} named Sam Guarino from the Roosevelt Hotel to the New Yorker Hotel in New York City to teach its staff {{how to make}} the drink so he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> whenever he was there.

2500|$|The band {{spent much}} of 2005 in the studio in Glasgow working on their {{follow-up}} album, You <b>Could</b> <b>Have</b> <b>It</b> So Much Better, which was released on 3 October 2005. The band initially intended to leave the album self-titled like their debut, but they changed it to You <b>Could</b> <b>Have</b> <b>It</b> So Much Better...With Franz Ferdinand before settling on the final title. The album's cover design was modelled on Alexander Rodchenko's 1924 portrait of Lilya Brik. The band attempted to broaden its musical range on the album; Hardy said, [...] "There's {{more to life than}} disco-beat guitar music". It was generally well received in the press and seen as an album equal to, or better than, their first by most critics. It entered the UK Album Charts at Number 1 and the US charts at Number 8. The album eventually sold 2 million copies worldwide. To support the album, four singles were released. Included in that set is a double A-side single that contained a video-clip-only single as well (both the AA-side [...] "L. Wells" [...] and the video-clip [...] "Jeremy Fraser" [...] are not featured on the album, recorded in early 2006 during the band's tour of Australia in support of the album). Also included is another video-clip-only single called [...] "Wine, In the Afternoon" [...] which is the B-side to [...] "Eleanor Put Your Boots On", and was also not featured on the album, but recorded on tour in Michigan. [...] "Do You Want To" [...] made it to number 4 and was declared by Q to be the greatest single of 2005, while [...] "Walk Away" [...] and [...] "The Fallen" [...] entered the top 15 of the UK Singles Chart. The fourth and final single from the second album, [...] "Eleanor Put Your Boots On", peaked at number 30. You <b>Could</b> <b>Have</b> <b>It</b> So Much Better went on to earn a nomination for Best Alternative Album at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards in 2006, as did [...] "Do You Want To" [...] for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.|$|E
