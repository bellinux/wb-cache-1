2500|$|The Cherokee-class of 10-gun brig-sloops was {{designed}} by Sir Henry Peake in 1807, and eventually over 100 were constructed. The working drawings for HMS Beagle and HMS Barracouta were issued to the Woolwich Dockyard on 16 February 1817, and amended in <b>coloured</b> <b>ink</b> on 16 July 1817 with modifications to increase {{the height of the}} bulwarks (the sides of the ship extended above the upper deck) by an amount varying from [...] at the stem to [...] at the stern. The Beagles keel was laid in June 1818, construction cost £7,803, and the ship was launched on 11 May 1820. In July of that year she took part in a fleet review on the River Thames, celebrating the coronation of King George IV of the United Kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|In this letter, Eusebius {{explains}} his ingenious system of Gospel harmony, the Eusebian Canons (tables) that divide the four Canonical gospels, and describes their purpose, ten in number. Eusebius explains that Ammonius the Alexandrian {{had made a}} system in which he placed sections of the gospels of Marc, Luke and John next to their parallel sections in Matthew. As this disrupted the normal text order of the gospels of Marc, Luke and John, Eusebius used {{a system in which}} he placed the references to the parallel texts in ten tables or 'canons'. By using these tables, the parallel texts could easily be looked up, but it also remained possible to read a gospel in its normal order. (The number of sections was: Matthew 355, Mark 236, Luke 342, John 232 – together 1165 sections). The number of each [...] "Ammonian section" [...] is written in the margin of a manuscript, and underneath these numbers, another number was written in <b>coloured</b> <b>ink.</b> The coloured numbers referred to one of the ten Eusebian canons, in which the reference numbers were to be found of the parallel sections in the other gospels.|$|E
2500|$|The {{manuscript}} has 224 medieval folios with a {{page size}} of 230 x 155mm and a typical text area of 160 x 95. The binding is modern, from 1932. The contents {{begin with a}} calendar, illustrated with {{the signs of the}} Zodiac in small roundels (ff. 4r-10v), with Scorpio as a dragon. [...] Then follow five full-page miniatures with gold grounds, showing: the Annunciation, Visitation, seated Virgin and Child, Christ in Majesty surrounded by the Evangelists' Symbols, and King David playing his harp (ff 12v-14v). [...] David faces the large Beatus initial (f 15r) that begins the text of the Latin Book of Psalms, which includes three scenes from the life of David along the stem of the [...] "B": David beheading Goliath, bringing his head to Saul, and harping, crowned as king. [...] This occupies about two thirds of the page. The usual ten English sections into which the psalms are divided are marked by smaller decorated initials, some historiated with figures. [...] These mark the start of Psalms 26 (f 38v), 38 (f 53r), 51 (f 66), 51 and 52 (f 66r and v), 68 with Jonah thrown off his ship, and riding on the whale (f 80v), 80 (f 98r), 97 (f 114r), 101 with Christ in the initial, and a kneeling monk below it with a scroll reading [...] "Lord hear my prayer" [...] (f 116), and 109 with the Trinity (f 132). [...] The initials {{at the start of the}} other psalms are in <b>coloured</b> <b>ink</b> of red, green and blue, with decoration. [...] Some of the decorative line-fillers have animal heads. [...] The psalms are followed by the Litany, with the royal saint Edward the Confessor, who rebuilt Westminster Abbey, written in gold on f 182 (as he was in the calendar at f 5), and special prayers for Edward and Saint Peter, the abbey's dedicatee.|$|E

60|$|A {{difference}} like this, once set up, implies thereafter innumerable other differences which naturally {{flow from}} it. Some {{of them are}} extremely remote and derivative. Take, for example, the case of writing and printing. Why do these run from left to right? At first sight such a practice seems clearly contrary to the instinctive tendency I noticed above--the tendency to draw from right to left, {{in accordance with the}} natural sweep of the hand and arm. And, indeed, {{it is a fact that}} all early writing habitually took the opposite direction from that which is now universal in western countries. Every schoolboy knows, for instance (or at least he would if he came up to the proper Macaulay standard), that Hebrew is written from right to left, and that each book begins at the wrong cover. The reason is that words, and letters, and hieroglyphics were originally carved, scratched, or incised, instead of being written with <b>coloured</b> <b>ink,</b> and the hand was thus allowed to follow its natural bent, and to proceed, as we all do in naïve drawing, with a free curve from the right leftward.|$|E
60|$|Having {{placed the}} {{enlarged}} prints side by side, {{two or three}} conspicuous and convenient points of reference, whether islands, enclosures, or particularly distinct bifurcations, should be identified and marked. By their help, {{the position of the}} prints should be readjusted, so that they shall be oriented exactly alike. From each point of reference, in succession, the spines of the ridges are then to be followed with a fine pencil, in the two prints alternately, neatly marking each new point of comparison with a numeral in <b>coloured</b> <b>ink</b> (Plate 13). When both of the prints are good and clear, this is rapidly done; wherever the impressions are faulty, there may be many ambiguities requiring patience to unravel. At first I was timid, and proceeded too hesitatingly when one of the impressions was indistinct, making short alternate traces. Afterwards on gaining confidence, I traced boldly, starting from any well-defined point of reference and not stopping until there were reasonable grounds for hesitation, and found it easy in this way to trace the unions between opposite and incompletely printed ends of ridges, and to disentangle many bad impressions.|$|E

6000|$|There {{are three}} classes {{of persons who}} are deeply {{concerned}} with parish registers--namely, villains, antiquaries, and the sedulous readers, [...] "parish clerks and others," [...] of the second or [...] "agony" [...] column of the Times. Villains {{are probably the most}} numerous of these three classes. The villain of fiction dearly loves a parish register: he cuts out pages, inserts others, intercalates remarks in a different <b>coloured</b> <b>ink,</b> and generally manipulates the register as a Greek manages his hand at ecarte, or as a Hebrew dealer in Moabite bric-a-brac treats a synagogue roll. We well remember one villain who had locked himself into the vestry (he was disguised as an archaeologist), and who was enjoying his wicked pleasure with the register, when the vestry somehow caught fire, the rusty key would not turn in the door, and the villain was roasted alive, in spite of the disinterested efforts to save him made by all the virtuous characters in the story. Let the fate of this bold, bad man be a warning to wicked earls, baronets, and all others who attempt to destroy the record of the marriage of a hero's parents. Fate will be too strong for them in the long run, though they bribe the parish clerk, or carry off in white wax an impression of the keys of the vestry and of the iron chest in which a register should repose.|$|E

50|$|Chigiri-e {{has become}} a popular art form. It {{can be used to}} create either {{realistic}} images or abstract ones. Its use in Japan is often decorative, using flowers and landscapes as subject matter. The paper may be coloured by the craftsman paper-maker but many artists colour the paper themselves, using vegetable dyes, <b>coloured</b> <b>inks</b> or powder pigments. The paper most often used is Tengujoshi: a handmade, long-fibered, very light weight paper (0.03 millimetres thickness).|$|R
50|$|It {{is likely}} that Danila copied this {{manuscript}} from an earlier, now-lost, Visigothic manuscript. The title and explicit frames {{are similar to those}} found in early manuscripts and the pages written in <b>coloured</b> <b>inks</b> are related to Late Antique manuscripts written in gold and silver on purple-dyed parchment. (For example, see Rossano Gospels). However Danila's use of colour was probably not present in the original manuscript and anticipates the use of colour in later Spanish manuscripts.|$|R
25|$|Blake {{could also}} colour the plates {{themselves}} in <b>coloured</b> <b>inks</b> before pressing them or tint them with watercolours after printing. Because of this aspect, {{a major component}} of relief etching was that every page of every book was a unique piece of art; no two copies of any page in Blake's entire oeuvre are identical. Variations in the actual print, different colouring choices, repainted plates, accidents during the acid bath etc., all led to multiple examples of the same plate.|$|R
50|$|Other pages include text in French, German, and Danish; {{illustrations}} of whisky bottles beer bottles and cigarettes; aeroplanes and oceangoing liners; cartoons of well dressed men and pretty girls and various maps of Copenhagen. One page declares, 'There's No Whiteness....Viva Free Algeria!' Each page is then {{covered with a}} second layer of <b>coloured</b> <b>ink</b> drops and drips, most of which go right to left, emphasising {{the direction of the}} book from beginning to end.|$|E
50|$|Some Mcor 3D {{printers}} {{can print}} parts in colour. This {{is achieved by}} depositing <b>coloured</b> <b>ink</b> on each sheet of paper - using a modified two-dimensional inkjet paper printer - and then loading those sheets of paper into {{the section of the}} printer where the cutting and gluing occurs. Colour 3D printing can be used to replicate the appearance of buildings, maps, products, anatomy, and molecular structures. It can also add annotations to prototypes, display the results of structural analyses (i.e., finite element analyses) and be used to produce consumer products.|$|E
50|$|Copying pencils (or {{indelible}} pencils): These are graphite pencils with {{an added}} dye that creates an indelible mark. They were invented {{in the late}} 19th century for press copying and as a practical substitute for fountain pens. Their markings are often visually indistinguishable from those of standard graphite pencils, but when moistened their markings dissolve into a <b>coloured</b> <b>ink,</b> which is then pressed into another piece of paper. They were widely used until the mid 20th century when ball pens slowly replaced them. In Italy their use is still mandated by law for voting paper ballots in elections and referenda.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Although {{surgical}} pathologists {{are aware}} of the multiple advantages that <b>coloured</b> <b>inks</b> contribute to surgical pathology practice, these <b>coloured</b> <b>inks</b> are not available in India and importing them is not a viable proposition. A systematic search for locally available coloring agents was done, and resulted in identifying specific shades within a popular set of children′s hobby colors of a particular brand. They retain their bright distinct colors on paraffin blocks and sections. These paints are available all over India, and are cheap, safe, and easy to use. Coloring gross specimen excision margins with different colors, adds precision to margin examination. It allows three-dimensional microscopic reconstruction of the tumor vis-a-vis its various neighboring anatomic structures. It allows postoperative comparison of tissue planes predicted by preoperative imaging. It maintains orientation of grossed and dissected specimens, enabling the pathologist to re-visit the grossed specimen, if required, and confidently allows further sampling if necessary. Aim: A systematic search for indigenous coloring agents was carried out, which included the dyes used in the histopathology laboratory, gelatin, commercially available paints, including acrylic paints and inks. Results: The study identified specific shades within a brand of acrylic colors that are easily available and simple to use, with good results on microscopic examination. Conclusion: Colored inks lend precision to margin examination. A set of easily procurable colors are available in our country, which are easy to use, with distinct bright colors, safe, and reliable...|$|R
