40|$|Implementing {{successful}} rural computing applications requires {{addressing a}} number of significant challenges. Recent advances in mobile phone computing capabilities make this device a likely candidate to address the client hardware constraints. Long battery life, wireless connectivity, solid-state memory, low price and immediate utility all make it better suited to rural conditions than a PC. However, current mobile software platforms are not as appropriate. Web-based mobile applications are hard to use, do not take advantage of the mobile phone’s media capabilities and require an online connection. Custom mobile applications are difficult to develop and distribute. To address these limitations we present CAM- a new framework for developing and deploying mobile computing applications in the rural developing world. CAM applications are accessed by capturing barcodes using the mobile phone camera, or entering numeric strings with the keypad. Supporting minimal navigation, direct linkage to paper practices and offline multi-media interaction, CAM is uniquely adapted to rural device, user and infrastructure constraints. To illustrate the breadth of the framework, we list {{a number of}} CAM-based applications that we have implemented or are planning. These include processing microfinance loans, facilitating rural supply <b>chains,</b> <b>documenting</b> grassroots innovation and accessing electronic medical histories...|$|R

40|$|Giant cell {{arteritis}} (GCA) is {{a spontaneous}} vasculitic syndrome that specifically targets {{the walls of}} medium and large arteries. Vascular lesions are characterized by patchy granulomatous infiltrates composed of T cells, macrophages, histiocytes, and giant cells. To test the hypothesis that a locally residing antigen recruits T cells into the vessel walls, we have analyzed T cell receptor (TCR) molecules of tissue infiltrating T cells. A total of 638 CD 4 + T cell clones were isolated from temporal artery specimens of three patients with GCA. Analysis of TCR molecules for the usage of V beta 1 -V beta 20 revealed that all TCR V beta elements were represented, demonstrating that interleukin 2 (IL- 2) -responsive T cells infiltrating the tissue are highly diverse. To detect expanded T cell specificities, we made use of the patchy character of the inflammatory disease and compared the TCR repertoire of T cells established from independent vasculitic foci of the same artery. Sequence analysis of TCR V beta <b>chains</b> <b>documented</b> that individual TCR specificities were present in multiple copies, indicating clonal expansion. T cells with identical beta chains were isolated from distinct inflammatory foci of the same patient. These specificities represented {{only a small fraction}} of tissue-infiltrating T cells and involved the V beta 5. 3 gene segment in the two patients sharing the HLA-DRB 1 * 0401 allele. The third complementarity determining region of clonally expanded TCR beta chains was characterized by a cluster of negatively and positively charged residues, suggesting that the juxtaposed antigenic peptide is charged. The sharing of identical T cell specificities by distinct and independent regions of the granulomatous inflammation suggests that these T cells are disease relevant and that their repertoire is strongly restricted. These data suggest that an antigen residing in the arterial wall is recognized by a small fraction of CD 4 + T cells in the inflammatory process characteristic for GCA...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} {{examines}} the key {{factors in the}} perception of politeness in a hotel front-line environment. The area of front-line communication has been mainly addressed in research by business and hospitality scholars, and although politeness has been researched extensively in communication contexts, the two areas have not been interconnected by researchers. Courtesy, however, is an essential aspect of customer satisfaction. The multi-cultural context of the tourism industry presents a number of communication challenges for its actors. As a result, miscommunication that is referred to in hospitality studies as ‘service failure’ is a frequent occurrence. 	The study draws its data from two main data collection methods: a qualitative focus group discussion at one hotel and a quantitative survey of front-line staff at all of the hotels belonging to the <b>chain.</b> <b>Documents</b> and informal interviews with higher ranked managers of the organisation were used for triangulation purposes. 	The findings indicate that front-line employees prefer to base their communication on their individual perception of politeness when interacting with guests. National culture appears to be a strong motivator for front-line communication. Corporate culture is demonstrated to become of higher relevance later in a given conversational sequence. Results also reveal that front-line staff prefer to find ways to forgo face-threatening situations. If this is not possible, active repairs have to be made to re-establish the necessary and required level of politeness. In this study, the organisation provides employees with few guidelines in the form of intercultural training and lets staff employ trial and error techniques to develop the necessary behaviour patterns by themselves. Behaviour appears to be strongly influenced by stereotyping and prejudices. However, not only employees are prone to using stereotypes when interacting with customers, but staff members feel that they are judged on superficial terms by the guests as well. Overall, behaviours also appear to differ depending on the nature of a guest’s visit to the hotel. International tourists appear to be more forgiving than business travellers in situations where politeness levels are not adhered to...|$|R

40|$|Automatic {{document}} clustering {{is one of}} {{the important}} operations performed on text documents. Most clustering algorithms put each data point (here, document) into one cluster. In the real world, each docu-ment contains multiple themes which can-not be detected by hard clustering algo-rithms. Thus, we provide a soft clustering algorithm, wherein each document can be associated to multiple clusters. We trans-form the dataset into a feature space of lexical chains using the WordNet. Lexi-cal <b>chains</b> as <b>document</b> features are advan-tageous over the Bag of Words approach, both in terms of speed and quality of re-sults obtained. Our algorithm uses the global lexical chain set, which is nothing but the union of the lexical <b>chains</b> from individual <b>documents.</b> A semantic simi-larity matrix is calculated on this global set of lexical chains. This matrix is fur-ther used to create a graph, each node of which represents a lexical chain. The algo-rithm we propose connects each node (lex-ical chain) to another node only if the se-mantic similarity between them is greater than a given threshold. Once this is done, we find maximal cliques of length one from the graph. Lexical chains belong-ing to a clique are a cluster of seman-tically related topics. After the forma-tion of lexical-chain clusters, we associate each of them to each document, which is qualified by the lexical chains extracted from it. One document can be associ-ated to more than one cluster of lexical chains giving soft clusters of documents. Documents associated with the same clus-ter would have semantically similar lexical chains. Further if each cluster represents a distinct topic, this soft clustering algo-rithm can facilitate topic detection. Em-pirically we compare the performance of our algorithm with some recently reported soft clustering algorithms in the literature. The algorithm is demonstrated on three popular benchmarks, namely, Brown cor-pus, Reuters corpus and 20 Newsgroups dataset...|$|R
