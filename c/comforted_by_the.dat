5|$|The Shogunate {{also was}} {{preparing}} for further conflict by modernizing its forces. In line with Parkes' designs, the British, previously the Shogunate's primary partner, proved reluctant to provide assistance. The Tokugawa thus came to rely mainly on French expertise, <b>comforted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> military prestige of Napoleon III at that time, acquired through his successes in the Crimean War and the War of Italy.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-seven years later, in September 2016, Dot {{discovers that}} Colin is marrying {{a man called}} Eddie Tsang (Kevin Shen) and has invited her to his wedding, which she accepts, but then has doubts as she still {{believes}} that gay marriage is wrong, due to her religious beliefs, despite accepting gay relationships. Colin arrives at Dot's house, saying he had a feeling she would {{not go to the}} wedding. Colin visits The Queen Victoria pub and witnesses the funeral of Paul Coker (Jonny Labey), who was killed for being gay, and laments to another gay man, Johnny Carter (Ted Reilly), of the homophobia in the world, but is <b>comforted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> majority of gay acceptance. After exchanging memories, Dot agrees to attend the wedding, much to Colin's delight.|$|E

The Voyager captives {{are now in}} a {{simulated}} environment designed especially for their long-term <b>comfort</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Nyrians. The Nyrians find this gradual method of capturing ships, space stations, and colonies more civilized than war, and have no wish to harm their captives, but of course cannot allow them to escape.|$|R

Upon arriving at this village Vanyel is left to assist in protecting the village from minor harm and instead finds himself {{face to face with}} a Blood magic crazed wizard. In Vanyel's attempts to deflect the wizards magic he pulls on the power of a node and destroys the wizard with the raw power. He believes he will die as well, but is <b>comforted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> thought that he will be with Tylendel. Vanyel wakes to find himself with his aunt in K'Treva as she presents him with the white robes of a full-fledged Herald-Mage.|$|E
25|$|Ezio's story {{continues}} in 1499, where he exits the Vault, confused {{by what he}} saw inside. He escapes Rome with his uncle, Mario Auditore, and returns to Monteriggioni. Once home, Ezio is <b>comforted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> prospect that his personal vendetta is over; however, Niccolò Machiavelli challenges Ezio's decision to leave Rodrigo Borgia (now Pope Alexander VI) alive. The following morning - New Year’s Day - Monteriggioni is besieged by Cesare Borgia, son of Rodrigo. Mario is killed at the hands of Cesare himself, and the Apple lost to Cesare and the Templars. Ezio escapes with his family and travels once more to Rome, the center of Templar power in Italy, once again seeking vengeance against the Borgias. There, he discovers that the Assassins are failing in their fight against corruption. Determined to rebuild the Guild, Ezio convinces Machiavelli that he has what it takes to lead while assembling a Brotherhood powerful enough to destroy the Templars and his new nemesis, Cesare.|$|E
25|$|Amelia's father, John Sedley, becomes bankrupt. George's rich father forbids George {{to marry}} Amelia, {{who is now}} poor. Dobbin persuades George to marry Amelia, and George is {{consequently}} disinherited. News arrives that Napoleon has escaped from Elba, so George Osborne, William Dobbin and Rawdon Crawley are deployed to Brussels, accompanied by Amelia and Becky, and Amelia's brother, Jos. George is embarrassed by the vulgarity of Mrs. Major O'Dowd, {{the wife of the}} head of the regiment. Already, the newly wedded Osborne is growing tired of Amelia, and he becomes increasingly attracted to Becky, which makes Amelia jealous and unhappy. He is also losing money to Rawdon at cards and billiards. At a ball in Brussels, George gives Becky a note inviting her to run away with him. But then the army have marching orders to the Battle of Waterloo, and George spends a tender night with Amelia and leaves. The noise of battle horrifies Amelia, and she is <b>comforted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> brisk but kind Mrs. O'Dowd. Becky is indifferent and makes plans for whatever the outcome (if Napoleon wins, she would aim to become the mistress of one of his Marshals...). She also makes a profit selling her carriage and horses at inflated prices to Jos, seeking to flee Brussels.|$|E

5000|$|Grace Williams {{composed}} Sea Sketches in 1944, {{while living}} in Hampstead, London. Shortly after completing the work Williams wrote to Gerald Cockshott, in 1945, saying [...] "I don't {{want to stay in}} London - I just long to get home and live in <b>comfort</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sea". She returned to her home town of Barry in south Wales, two years later.|$|R

500|$|An early {{example of}} the First Lady's {{protective}} nature occurred when Senator Strom Thurmond entered the President's hospital room that day in March, passing the Secret Service detail by claiming he was the President's [...] "close friend", presumably to acquire media attention. Nancy was outraged and demanded he leave. While the President recuperated in the hospital, the First Lady slept {{with one of his}} shirts to be <b>comforted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> scent. When Ronald Reagan was released from the hospital on April 12, she escorted him back to the White House.|$|E
500|$|The {{next morning}} Henry goes into {{battle for the}} third time. His {{regiment}} encounters {{a small group of}} Confederates, and in the ensuing fight Henry proves to be a capable soldier, <b>comforted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> belief that his previous cowardice had not been noticed, as he [...] "had performed his mistakes in the dark, so he was still a man". Afterward, while looking for a stream from which to obtain water with a friend, he discovers from the commanding officer that his regiment has a lackluster reputation. The officer speaks casually about sacrificing the 304th because they are nothing more than [...] "mule drivers" [...] and [...] "mud diggers." [...] With no other regiments to spare, the general orders his men forward.|$|E
500|$|Successful mystery novelist Adrienne Delaney (Victoria Morsell) and her {{photographer}} husband Don Gordon (David Homb) {{have just}} purchased a remote mansion {{off the coast}} of a small New England island previously owned by a famous 19th-century magician, Zoltan [...] "Carno" [...] Carnovasch (Robert Miano), whose five wives all died mysteriously. Adrienne hopes to find an inspiration for her next novel in her new home, but starts having nightmares immediately upon moving in. She is <b>comforted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> loving and supportive Don. Adrienne explores the estate, making mysterious discoveries like strange music, warnings written on her computer, and ominous messages from a fortune-teller automaton.

50|$|Religious funeral {{services}} commonly include prayers, readings from a sacred text, hymns (sung either <b>by</b> <b>the</b> attendees or a hired vocalist) and words of <b>comfort</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> clergy. Frequently, a relative or close friend {{will be asked}} to give a eulogy, which details happy memories and accomplishments rather than criticism. Sometimes the eulogy is delivered by clergy. Church bells may also be tolled {{both before and after the}} service.|$|R

2500|$|The {{second level}} of {{conscious}} despair {{under the heading}} [...] "Despair over the eternal." [...] Someone in this level views themself {{in light of their}} own weakness. Unlike in the upper level, this weakness is understood and as such, instead of turning to faith and humbling oneself before God, they despair in their own weakness and unworthiness. In this sense, they despair over the eternal and refuse to be <b>comforted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> light of God.|$|E
2500|$|Poet and {{cultural}} critic Wayne Koestenbaum criticizes Brown for affirming the anus as [...] "a bodily and symbolic zone" [...] while ignoring its connection to sodomy and homosexual desire. Koestenbaum, unlike Brown, believes that to privilege the anus is to [...] "admit {{the desirability of}} male homosexual relations." [...] Cultural historian Richard Webster finds Life Against Death {{to be similar to}} Erik Erikson's Young Man Luther (1958) in that it suggests similarities between Lutheran Protestantism and classical psychoanalysis. Webster believes that the resemblances are scarcely disputable. However, he writes that while Protestants may be <b>comforted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> discovery that the revealed truths perceived by Luther are in harmony with Freud's hypotheses, others may regard such a [...] "congruence of ancient faith and modern reason" [...] with scepticism and [...] "ask to what extent we should regard psychoanalysis not as a scientific approach to human nature but as a disguised continuation of the Judaeo-Christian tradition." [...] Webster describes Brown's work, like that of Marcuse, Jacques Lacan, and several other modern thinkers, as [...] "a doomed and tragic attempt to reconstruct {{at the level of the}} intellect a sensual identity which has been crucified at the level of the spontaneous and vital body." [...] Historian Arthur Marwick dismissed Life Against Death as, [...] "a curious ragbag of quotations". Author Jay Cantor described Brown's Life Against Death and Marcuse's Eros and Civilization as [...] "equally profound".|$|E
2500|$|The king {{hears about}} a maiden {{being the most}} {{beautiful}} and charming in the land, {{who happens to be}} Imoinda and also falls in love. Despite his Intelligence saying she had been claimed by Oroonoko, the gives Imoinda a sacred veil, thus forcing her to become one of his wives, even though she is already promised to Oroonoko. After Imoinda unwillingly, but dutifully spends time in the king's harem (the Otan), Oroonoko is <b>comforted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> idea of the king being too old to ravish Imoinda. Over time the Prince plans a tryst {{with the help of the}} sympathetic Onahal (one of the kings wives) and Aboan (a friend to the prince). The Prince and Imoinda are reunited for a short time and consummate the marriage, but are eventually discovered. Imoinda and Onahal are given the worse possible punishment by being sold as slaves for their actions. The king's guilt, however, leads him to falsely inform Oroonoko that Imoinda has been executed, since death was thought to be better than slavery. The Prince grieves for an extended time by lying on a carpet and refusing to get up. Later, after winning another tribal war, Oroonoko and his men goes to visit an English captain on his ship and is tricked and shackled after drinking. The English Captain plans to sell him and his men as slaves. Oroonoko and his men are carried to Surinam, at that time an English colony based in the West Indies. Oroonoko is purchased by a Cornish man named Trefry, but given special treatment for his being educated and ability to speak French and English (which he learned from his own French slave). The two men grow to be acquaintances. Trefry mentions that he came into owning the most beautiful slave maiden and had to stop himself from forcing her into sex. Unbeknownst to Oroonoko, Trefry is speaking of Imoinda who is at the same plantation. [...] The two lovers are reunited under the new Christian names of Caesar and Clemene.|$|E

For 1969, the Marauder became a stand-alone model replacing the S-55. While heavily based on the two-door Marquis, it wore its own bodywork from the windshield back. A personal-luxury coupe sized above the Ford Thunderbird, the Marauder was aimed at the Oldsmobile Toronado and Buick Riviera.|$|R
