25|$|The {{first use}} of a <b>coronary</b> <b>stent</b> is {{typically}} attributed to Jacques Puel and Ulrich Sigwart when they implanted a stent into a patient in Toulouse, France in 1986. It {{was used as a}} scaffold to prevent the vessel from closing and to avoid restenosis in coronary surgery—a condition where scar tissue grows within the stent and interferes with vascular flow. Shortly thereafter in 1987, Julio Palmaz (known for patenting a balloon-expandable stent) and Richard Schatz implanted their similar stent into a patient in Germany. The use of these bare-metal stents helped reduce the incidence of restenosis from 30–40% in coronary surgery to 20–30%.|$|E

The univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to explore the current use of VKA and prognosis of patients with AF undergoing <b>coronary</b> <b>stenting.</b> The primary end-point was composite of all-cause death, nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, serious bleeding events, unplanned repeat revascularization, and worsening heart failure at 12 -month follow-up after <b>coronary</b> <b>stenting.</b> Results: AF patients undergoing <b>coronary</b> <b>stenting</b> have more clinical concomitant diseases. Only 9. 0 % AF patients after <b>coronary</b> <b>stenting</b> received triple antithrombotic therapy (VKA, aspirin, and clopidogrel) at discharge.

Despite tremendous advances in therapy, in-stent restenosis (ISR) remains a key problem after <b>coronary</b> <b>stenting.</b> <b>Coronary</b> CT angiography evolved {{as a valuable}} tool in the diagnostic workup of patients after coronary revascularization therapy. It has a negative predictive value {{in the range of}} 98 % for ruling out significant ISR. As CT imaging of <b>coronary</b> <b>stents</b> depends on patient and stent characteristics, patient selection is crucial for success. Ideal candidates have stents with a diameter of 3 mm and more. Nevertheless, even with most recent CT scanners, about 8 % of stents are not accessible mostly due to blooming or motion artifacts. While the diagnosis of ISR is currently based on the visual assessment of the stent lumen, functional information on the hemodynamic significance of in-stent stenosis became available with the most recent generation of dual source CT scanners.
