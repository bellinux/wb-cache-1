In quantum mechanics, where all particle momenta are associated with waves, it is the formation of such a wave packet which localizes the wave, and thus the particle, in space. In states where a quantum mechanical particle is bound, it must be localized as a wave packet, and the existence of the packet and its minimum size implies a spread and minimal value in particle wavelength, and thus also momentum and energy.

A section {{of it was}} given, showing the {{reversed}} position of the Hippurite limestone in the summit and lower precipices. This limestone wave was shown {{to be one of}} a great series, running parallel with the Alps, and constituting an undulatory district, chiefly composed of chalk beds, separated from the higher limestone district of the Jura and Lias by a long trench or moat, filled with members of the tertiary series--chiefly nummulite limestones and flysch. This trench might be followed from Faverges, {{at the head of the}} lake of Annecy, across Savoy. It separated Mont Vergi from the Mont Dorons, and the Dent d'Oche from the Dent du Midi; then entered Switzerland, separating the Moleson from the Diablerets; passed on through the districts of Thun and Brientz, and, dividing itself into two, caused the zigzagged form of the lake of Lucerne. The principal branch then passed between the high Sentis and the Glarnisch, and broke into confusion in the Tyrol. On the north side of this trench the chalk beds were often vertical, or cast into repeated folds, of which the escarpments were mostly turned away from the Alps; but on the south side of the trench, the Jurassic, Triassic, and Carboniferous beds, though much distorted, showed a prevailing tendency to lean towards the Alps, and turn their escarpments to the central chain.|$|E

A novel {{mutation}} in the anthranilate synthase alpha 1 (ASA 1) gene, named trp 5 - 2 wvc 1, and mutations in the tryptophan synthase alpha and beta 1 genes (trp 3 - 1 and trp 2 - 1, respectively) confer a <b>compressed</b> root <b>wave</b> phenotype on tilted agar surfaces.

Although the roots of 7 -day-old seedlings possess higher concentrations of free L-Trp than the shoot as a whole, trp 5 - 2 wvc 1 mutants show no detectable alteration in L-Trp levels in either tissue type, suggesting that a very localized shortage of L-Trp, or of a L-Trp-derived compound, {{is responsible for the}} observed phenotype...|$|R

40|$|Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs), {{formed by}} {{high-speed}} corotating streams interacting with slow speed streams, {{have been examined}} from - 20 deg to - 36 deg heliolatitudes. The high-speed streams emanate from a polar coronal hole that Ulysses eventually becomes fully embedded in as it travels towards the south pole. We find that the trailing portion of the CIR, from the interface surface (IF) to the reverse shock (RS), contains both large amplitude transverse fluctuations and magnitude fluctuations. Similar fluctuations have been previously noted to exist within CIRs detected in the ecliptic plane, but their existence has not been explained. The normalized magnetic field component variances within {{this portion of the}} CIR and in the trailing high-speed stream are approximately the same, indicating that the fluctuations in the CIR are <b>compressed</b> Alfven <b>waves.</b> Mirror mode structures with lower intensities are also observed in the trailing portion of the CIR, presumably generated from a local instability driven by free energy associated with compression of the high-speed solar wind plasma. The mixture of these two modes (<b>compressed</b> Alfven <b>waves</b> and mirror modes) plus other modes generated by three wave processes (wave-shock interactions) lead to a lower Alfvenicity within the trailing portion of the CfR than in the high-speed stream proper. The results presented in this paper suggest a mechanism for generation of large amplitude B(sub z) fluctuations within CIRS.

40|$|AbstractA {{numerical}} {{study has}} been carried out to investigate the full flow path and aerodynamic characteristics of a hypersonic vehicle at a 7. 0 free stream Mach number. Results indicate that the inlet started and unstarted operations have remarkable effects on the flow pattern of the full flow path. When the inlet operates in a started mode, the transverse pressure gradient generated by the forebody alters the air captured characteristics and the entering flow quality of the inlet. Furthermore, the expansion process of the nozzle jet flow is obviously affected by the external flow field around the afterbody with the cross section shape transiting from a near rectangle at the exit of the nozzle to a near triangle at the tail of the vehicle. When the inlet operates in an unstarted mode, the aerodynamic instability can be observed in the full flow path of the vehicle. Due to the oscillation of the external <b>compressed</b> shock <b>wave</b> and nozzle jet flow, the aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle vary periodically with the lift-drag ratio changing from 0. 25 to 2. 09.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms that}} allow plant roots to use gravity and touch as growth guides are investigated. We {{are using a}} molecular genetic strategy in Arabidopsis thaliana to study these processes. When Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grow on tilted hard-agar surfaces, their roots develop a wavy pattern of growth which appears to derive from a succession of left-handed and right-handed circumnutation-like processes triggered by gravity and touch stimulation (Okada and Shimura, 1990; Rutherford et al., 1998; Rutherford and Masson, 1996). Interestingly, mutations that affect root waving on tilted hard-agar surfaces can be identified and characterized. Some of these mutations affect root gravitropism, while others appear {{to be responsible for}} the production of abnormal <b>waves</b> (no <b>waves,</b> <b>compressed</b> or square <b>waves,</b> coils) without affecting gravitropism. The specific objectives of this project were to functionally characterize two genes (WVD 2 and WVD 6) which are required for root waving on tilted agar surfaces, but not for root gravitropism. Specific objectives included a physiological and cytological analysis of the mutants, and molecular cloning and characterization of the corresponding genes. As summarized in this paper, we have reached these objectives. We have also identified and partially characterized other mutations that affect root skewing on hard-agar surfaces (sku 5 - 1 and ago 1), and have completed our work on the root-wave phenotype associated with mutations in genes of the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway (Lynn et al., 1999; Rutherford et al., 1998; Sedbrook et al., 2000, 2002).

Limestone cliffs are particularly vulnerable to this kind of erosion. Attrition is where particles/seaload carried by the waves are worn down as they hit each other and the cliffs. This then makes the material easier to wash away. The material ends up as shingle and sand. Another significant source of erosion, particularly on carbonate coastlines, is the boring, scraping and grinding of organisms, a process termed bioerosion.|$|R
