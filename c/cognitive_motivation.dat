They argued that, if this [...] "need" [...] were frustrated, it would generate [...] "feelings of tension and deprivation" [...] that would instigate [...] "active efforts to structure the situation and increase understanding" [...] (p. 291), though the particular situations arousing and satisfying the need may vary (p. 291). Cohen argued that even in structured situations, people high in NFC see ambiguity and strive for higher standards of cognitive clarity.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Cacioppo collaborated with Richard E. Petty {{to develop the}} {{elaboration}} likelihood model (ELM) of attitudes and persuasion and began investigations of individual differences in <b>cognitive</b> <b>motivation.</b> They also examined the social and biological influences on mind and behavior. A decade later, Cacioppo began working with Gary Berntson to pioneer a new field they called Social neuroscience. This led to an expansion of Cacioppo’s research examining how personal relationships get under the skin to affect Social cognition and emotions, personality processes, biology, and health. By employing brain scans, monitoring of autonomic and neuroendocrine processes, and assays of immune function, he found the overpowering influence of social context — a factor so strong that it can alter genetic expression in white blood cells. The work further showed how the subjective sense of social isolation (loneliness) uniquely disrupts our perceptions, behavior, and physiology, becoming a trap that not only reinforces isolation, but {{can also lead to}} early death. In 2004, he and William Patrick began a collaboration that led to their book, Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection, which makes the case that social cooperation is, in fact, humanity’s defining characteristic. Cacioppo, together with Gary Berntson, Jean Decety, Stephanie Cacioppo, Steve Cole, John Capitanio, Dorret Boomsma, and Abraham Palmer continue to investigate the biological mechanisms involved in social perception, interpersonal processes, cognition, emotion, and behavior.|$|E

50|$|The three {{critical}} psychological {{states of}} job characteristic theory (JCT) draw upon <b>cognitive</b> <b>motivation</b> theory and some previous work on identifying {{the presence of}} certain psychological states could lead to favorable outcomes. JCT provided the chance to systematically assessed {{the relationship between the}} previously discovered psychological states ('Experienced Meaningfulness, 'Experienced Responsibility, and Knowledge of Results) and outcomes. More importantly, previous work on work design showed job characteristics can predict individual performance, but did not provide “why” and “how” this relationship existed. Job Characteristics Theory filled this gap by building a bridge between job characteristics and work-related outcomes through the use of the three critical psychological states. The three psychological states, which are also the conceptual core of the theory, include (1) Experienced Meaningfulness of the Work, (2) Experienced Responsibility for the Outcomes of the Work, and (3) Knowledge of the Results of Work Activities. These psychological states are theorized to mediate the relationship between job characteristics and work-related outcomes. According to the theory, these three critical psychological states are noncompensatory conditions, meaning jobholders have to experience all three critical psychological states to achieve the outcomes proposed in the model. For example, when workers experience the three psychological states, they feel good about themselves when they perform well. These positive feelings, in turn, reinforce the workers to keep performing well.|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been assumed that people treat {{cognitive}} effort as costly, but also that such effort costs may vary greatly across individuals. Individual differences in subjective effort could present a major and pervasive confound in behavioral and neuroscience assessments, by conflating cognitive ability with <b>cognitive</b> <b>motivation.</b> Self-report cognitive effort scales have been developed, but objective measures are lacking. In this study, we use the behavioral economic approach of revealed preferences to quantify subjective effort. Specifically, we adapted a well-established discounting paradigm to measure {{the extent to which}} cognitive effort causes participants to discount monetary rewards. The resulting metrics are sensitive to both within-individual factors, including objective load and reward amount, and between-individual factors, including age and trait cognitive engagement. We further validate cognitive effort discounting by benchmarking it against wellestablished measures of delay discounting. The results highlight the promise and utility of behavioral economic tools for assessing trait and state influences on <b>cognitive</b> <b>motivation...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceFictive Motion (FM) {{characterizes the}} use of dynamic {{expressions}} to describe static scenes. This phenomenon is crucial in terms of <b>cognitive</b> <b>motivations</b> for language use; several explanations have been proposed to account for it, among which mental simulation (Talmy 2000) and visual scanning (Matlock 2004 a). The aims of this paper are to test these competing explanations and identify language-specific constraints. To do this, we compared the linguistic strategies for expressing several types of static configurations in four languages, French, Italian, German and Serbian, with an experimental setup (59 participants). The experiment yielded significant differences for motion-affordance vs no motion-affordance, for all 4 languages. Significant differences between languages included mean frequency of FM expressions. In order to refine the picture, and more specifically to disentangle the respective roles of language-specific conventions and language-independent (i. e. possibly <b>cognitive)</b> <b>motivations,</b> we completed our study with a corpus approach (besides the four initial languages, we added English and Polish). The corpus study showed low frequency of FM across languages, but a higher frequency and translation ratio for some FM types – among which those best accounted for by enactive perception. The importance of enactive perception could thus explain both the universality of FM {{and the fact that}} language-specific conventions appear mainly in very specific contexts – the ones furthest from enaction...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} shows that bodily experiences can unconsciously influence perception, judgment, and behavior. However, inconsistency among recent findings in the embodied cognition literature suggests a need for theoretical boundary conditions. While research appears to assume that embodied effects are necessarily implicit (Schnall, 2017), the extant literature has not directly manipulated the role that conscious awareness of bodily states plays in embodied cognition. Dual process theories of social cognition assert that information processing falls along a continuum, from processing that is relatively automatic, effortless, and experiential, to processing that is relatively deliberate, controlled, and rational. Importantly, information processed along the dimensions of this continuum can lead to different outcomes. Thus, if the body influences social cognition in a more implicit manner, experimentally manipulating conscious awareness of a bodily state may lend further insight into when embodiment is attenuated. Six studies tested this possibility {{in the case of}} the demonstrated effect of weight sensations on judgments of an abstract idea’s importance (e. g., Ackerman, Nocera, & Bargh, 2010; Jostmann, Lakens, Schubert, 2009). Studies 1 and 2 revealed a curvilinear relationship between increased clipboard weight and ratings of importance such that participants rated a topic as more important when holding a moderately heavy, compared to light, clipboard; however, the importance ratings decreased when the clipboard was very heavy. This curvilinear relationship was not caused by a negative evaluation of the topic or the activation of a different metaphor (burden). In Study 3, ratings of importance increased with a moderately heavy clipboard compared to a light clipboard, but this difference was eliminated by explicitly drawing perceiver's attention to the weight of the clipboard. Study 4 extended the model and showed that even a very heavy clipboard can act as an embodiment of importance when participants are prevented from deliberately processing the weight of the clipboard via a cognitive load manipulation. Study 5 provided limited evidence establishing the role of <b>cognitive</b> <b>motivation</b> in embodiment as measured by need for cognition. However, experimentally manipulating <b>cognitive</b> <b>motivation</b> in Study 6 showed that individuals with higher <b>cognitive</b> <b>motivation</b> were more likely to show the embodied effect when the heft of the clipboard was subtle (i. e., holding a moderately heavy clipboard) whereas those with lower <b>cognitive</b> <b>motivation</b> were more likely to show the embodied effect when the heft of the clipboard was blatant (i. e., holding a very heavy clipboard). Collectively, these studies suggest that embodiment is subject to dual-processes whereby if something in the context draws conscious attention to a stimuli that activates an embodied metaphor, perceivers will no longer use their body as a source of information when processing the stimuli...|$|E
