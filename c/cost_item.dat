50|$|An {{economy is}} wage-led if the {{positive}} {{effect of a}} higher wage share on consumption dominates the potentially negative effects on investment and net exports. A redistribution of income toward wages boosts consumption demand because of the higher marginal propensity to consume derived from wages compared with the same measure derived from profits. The Review of Keynesian Economics suggest that mainstream models attach only one single role to wages: as a <b>cost</b> <b>item.</b> Thereby, they recognize only the positive effects that follow a decrease in wages: it will improve competitiveness and, ultimately, increase net exports, and it will {{have a positive effect on}} investment due to increased profitability. However, in post-Keynesian and Kaleckian models, wages have a dual role as both a <b>cost</b> <b>item</b> and a source of demand. While post-Keynesian models acknowledge the first two effects, they add a crucial element which is missing in the mainstream models: a wage decrease (or, to be precise, a decrease in the share of wages in national income) will certainly suppress domestic consumption, since the marginal propensity to consume out of wages is higher than that out of profits.|$|E
50|$|Although some {{claimed that}} the SSC cost was {{largely due to the}} massive civil {{engineering}} project of digging a huge tunnel underground, that was somewhat of a distortion. The tunneling and conventional facility buildout budget was only about ten percent of the total budgeted cost (1.1 billion dollars out of a total cost of 10 billion). The major <b>cost</b> <b>item</b> was the magnets, still in laboratory development phase, consequently with a higher level of uncertainty attached to the final cost.|$|E
40|$|Construction {{projects}} are typically {{carried out in}} highly uncertain environments with the risk of cost and time overruns, and subsequent disputes between stakeholders. One of common risk factors is that most <b>cost</b> <b>items</b> of a project are dependent random variables. Thus, correlations between basic <b>cost</b> <b>items</b> {{need to be considered}} in predicting the total cost of the project. This paper intends to propose a generic copula-based Monte Carlo simulation method for prediction of construction projects&# 039; total costs with dependent <b>cost</b> <b>items.</b> An algorithm to generate the joint probability distribution function of correlated <b>cost</b> <b>items</b> is developed and two examples are presented to demonstrate the applicability of copulas in modeling construction costs as random variables. A merit of the proposed method is that it not only can incorporate all different types of distributions in one framework, but it also captures the best dependence structure between variables. This paper finds that different dependence structures can lead to different probability distributions of total cost. It also finds that the existing goodness of fit tests can be employed in choosing the best performing copula. The paper concludes that the copula-based Monte Carlo simulation method can predict total cost of construction projects with reasonable accuracy...|$|R

50|$|Airlines in India {{spend about}} 13-15 {{percent of their}} {{revenues}} towards maintenance, the second-highest <b>cost</b> <b>item</b> for airlines after fuel. Generally airlines carry on-tarmac inspections (A and B checks) in-house and work with third-party MROs for engine, heavy maintenance (C and D checks) and modifications. Almost all airline MRO infrastructure in India is captive (largely with Air India) with only one fully operational independent third-party provider MRO, Air Works, with an EASA-certified facility in Hosur, near Bengaluru. Air Works provides heavy maintenance capability for Airbus A320, ATR 42/72 and Boeing 737/NG family of aircraft. GMR has set up in partnership with MAS an operational facility meeting EASA standards at Hyderabad.Till recently, {{in the absence of}} quality infrastructure, airlines carried out maintenance outside India at the nearest available MRO location (South East Asia, Middle East or Europe) incurring a ferry flight, logistics costs and engine and component hours. Having the flexibility to get the aircraft serviced in India, at a local MRO with EASA-approved facilities, results in 30-40% saving in aircraft maintenance costs for an airline, despite the tax regime on import of spares into the country making them 30% more expensive as compared to international MROs.In addition to taxation, the other key impediment to growth of airline MRO capacity in India is the lack of availability of hangar space at key international airports. This limits the ability of MROs to tap into the larger potential market of aircraft operating within 5-6 hours of flying distance from India.|$|E

Usually cost-of-illness studies {{investigate}} direct costs which are related to the treatment and indirect costs that are costs incurred due to the disease but not directly related to the treatment like productivity loss. Sometimes intangible costs like pain and deterioration of quality of life are also studied. Psychosis is a costly mental condition and Global Burden of Diseases by World Health Organization regards active psychosis as a highly disabling condition. There are studies about cost of psychosis or schizophrenia around the world and some of those done in developed countries were reviewed in this thesis. However, the cost of psychosis in Hong Kong is largely unknown. This thesis aims to estimate the cost of psychosis in Hong Kong from societal perspective by using data from a project called Jockey Club Early Psychosis (JCEP) Project. The estimation of the cost involved <b>cost</b> <b>item</b> identification, <b>cost</b> <b>item</b> measurement and <b>cost</b> <b>item</b> valuation. The direct cost of psychosis was estimated to be $ 1, 028 million which was 1. 17 % of total health expenditure and 2. 34 % of total public health expenditure in Hong Kong in 2009. Indirect cost due to productivity loss was $ 1, 083. 5 million. Like most of the countries reviewed, productivity loss made up the largest economic loss. However, the sample size was small and there were problems of generalisability in the estimations and this was discussed in the thesis. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to ensure the tender phase in its total price in a {{construction}} project. Today many construction projects is unmanageable and rejected mainly because of the price. By developing controlling key figures the companies can be more secure of the future costs during the project and therefore set a fair price.   This study is committed in corporation with an industrialized construction company. The company has a building system that is predefined which includes the heavy part in the total costs of the project.   The key figures are developed based on the actual price data from previous project that is divided in different cost items. Every <b>cost</b> <b>item</b> will have a control key figure. For the development of the figures a statistical method is used called regression analysis. The method requires a parameter that has a correlation to the cost items. The method will then generate a fitted function that can predict the costs of each item due to the parameter or parameters. And from the function a key indicator will be produced to function as an indicator to each <b>cost</b> <b>item...</b>|$|E
