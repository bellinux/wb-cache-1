5|$|Genodermatoses are {{inherited}} genetic skin conditions often {{grouped into}} three categories: <b>chromosomal,</b> single gene, and polygenetic.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, McClintock {{received}} {{funding from}} the National Academy of Sciences to start research on indigenous strains of maize in Central America and South America. She was interested in studying the evolution of maize through <b>chromosomal</b> changes, and being in South America would allow her {{to work on a}} larger scale. McClintock explored the <b>chromosomal,</b> morphological, and evolutionary characteristics of various races of maize. After extensive work in the 1960s and 1970s, McClintock and her collaborators published the seminal study The <b>Chromosomal</b> Constitution of Races of Maize, leaving their mark on paleobotany, ethnobotany, and evolutionary biology.|$|E

5|$|The genetic {{mutations}} seen in serous carcinoma are <b>chromosomal</b> instability and mutations in TP53, an important tumor suppressor gene.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chromosomal</b> toxin-antitoxin systems also exist, some {{of which}} perform cell {{functions}} such as responding to stresses, causing cell cycle arrest and bringing about programmed cell death. In evolutionary terms, toxin-antitoxin systems can be considered selfish DNA in {{that the purpose of}} the systems are to replicate, regardless of whether they benefit the host organism or not. Some have proposed adaptive theories to explain the evolution of toxin-antitoxin systems; for example, <b>chromosomal</b> toxin-antitoxin systems could have evolved to prevent the inheritance of large deletions of the host genome. Toxin-antitoxin systems have several biotechnological applications, such as a method of maintaining plasmids in cell lines, targets for antibiotics, and as positive selection vectors.|$|E
5|$|Double mutants deleted {{for both}} MLH3 (major pathway) and MMS4 (minor pathway) showed {{dramatically}} reduced crossing over compared to wild-type (6- to 17-fold); however spore viability was reasonably high (62%) and <b>chromosomal</b> disjunction appeared mostly functional.|$|E

5|$|The TNNI3 gene {{encoding}} cardiac troponin I (cTnI) {{is located}} at 19q13.4 in the human <b>chromosomal</b> genome. Human cTnI is a 24 kDa protein consisting of 210 amino acids with isoelectric point (pI) of 9.87. cTnI is exclusively expressed in adult cardiac muscle.|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{states that}} <b>chromosomal</b> toxin-antitoxin systems are {{designed}} to be bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. RelE, for example, is a global inhibitor of translation during nutrient stress, and its expression reduces the chance of starvation by lowering the cell's nutrient requirements. A homologue of mazF toxin called mazF-mx is essential for fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus.|$|E
5|$|Attempts at {{crossing}} species, whether from different sections or {{within the same}} section, of Erythranthe are not always successful. E. peregrina {{is an example of}} a successful naturally occurring hybrid that not only arose independently in two different locations, but is also a rare example of evolutionary recent allopolyploidization, complete <b>chromosomal</b> inheritance.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{prenatal}} {{tests for}} <b>chromosomal</b> abnormalities such as Down Syndrome rely on analysing {{the number and}} appearance of the chromosomesthe karyotype. Molecular diagnostics tests such as microarray comparative genomic hybridisation test a sample of DNA instead, and because of cell-free DNA in plasma, could be less invasive, but as of 2013 it is still an adjunct to the conventional tests.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to anticancer chemotherapy, in {{particular}} alkylating agents, {{can increase the}} risk of subsequently developing AML. The risk is highest about three to five years after chemotherapy. Other chemotherapy agents, specifically epipodophyllotoxins and anthracyclines, have also been associated with treatment-related leukemias, which are often associated with specific <b>chromosomal</b> abnormalities in the leukemic cells.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have four}} pairs of mammae, {{as usual in}} oryzomyines. Like most rice rats, Transandinomys species have twelve {{thoracic}} (chest) and seven lumbar vertebrae. According to a study in Costa Rica, T.bolivaris has 58chromosomes {{and the number of}} <b>chromosomal</b> arms (fundamental number) is 80 (2n=58, FN=80). Studies in Ecuador and Venezuela have recorded several different karyotypes in T.talamancae, with the number of chromosomes ranging from 34 to 54 and the fundamental number from 60 to 67.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Singh and {{his colleagues}} {{discovered}} that a tiny portion of the short arm of sex-determining Y chromosome was necessary and sufficient to convert a female mouse to male. This fundamental discovery provided a new concept of <b>Chromosomal</b> translocation of sex-determining region from Y chromosome to X chromosomes causing sex reversal in mice. These findings later became {{the foundation for the}} discovery of a similar phenomenon of sex reversal in humans.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that <b>chromosomal</b> copies of plasmid toxin-antitoxin systems may serve as anti-addiction modules– a method of omitting a plasmid from progeny without suffering {{the effects of the}} toxin. An example of this is an antitoxin on the Erwinia chrysanthemi genome that counteracts the toxic activity of an F plasmid toxin counterpart.|$|E
5|$|Some brain {{disorders}} such as Tay–Sachs {{disease are}} congenital, and linked to genetic and <b>chromosomal</b> mutations. A rare group of congenital cephalic disorders known as lissencephaly is characterised by the lack of, or inadequacy of, cortical folding. Normal development of the brain can be affected during pregnancy by nutritional deficiencies, teratogens, infectious diseases, and {{by the use of}} recreational drugs and alcohol.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of AML {{are caused by}} replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a drop in red blood cells, platelets, and normal white blood cells. These symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Several risk factors and <b>chromosomal</b> abnormalities have been identified, but the specific cause is not clear. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.|$|E
5|$|Marrow {{or blood}} is {{examined}} under light microscopy, {{as well as}} flow cytometry, to diagnose the presence of leukemia, to differentiate AML from other types of leukemia (e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukemia - ALL), and to classify the subtype of disease. A sample of marrow or blood is typically also tested for <b>chromosomal</b> abnormalities by routine cytogenetics or fluorescent in situ hybridization. Genetic studies may also be performed to look for specific mutations in genes such as FLT3, nucleophosmin, and KIT, which may influence {{the outcome of the}} disease.|$|E
5|$|The French-American-British (FAB) {{classification}} system divides AML into eight subtypes, M0 through to M7, {{based on the}} type of cell from which the leukemia developed and its degree of maturity. This is done by examining the appearance of the malignant cells with light microscopy and/or by using cytogenetics to characterize any underlying <b>chromosomal</b> abnormalities. The subtypes have varying prognoses and responses to therapy. Although the WHO classification (see above) may be more useful, the FAB system is still widely used.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form of <b>chromosomal</b> {{crossover}} is homologous recombination, where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce <b>chromosomal</b> translocations and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51. The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction, in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north-south cleavage. The north-south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east-west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.|$|E
5|$|Women and men {{differ in}} their <b>chromosomal</b> makeup, protein gene products, genomic imprinting, gene expression, {{signaling}} pathways, and hormonal environment. All of these necessitate caution in extrapolating information derived from biomarkers from one sex to the other. Women are particularly vulnerable at the two extremes of life. Young women and adolescents are at risk from STIs, pregnancy and unsafe abortion, while older women often have few resources and are disadvantaged with respect to men, and also {{are at risk of}} dementia and abuse, and generally poor health.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chromosomal</b> inversions: {{reversing}} {{the orientation of}} a <b>chromosomal</b> segment.|$|E
25|$|New {{descriptions}} {{include the}} term Copy-number variants (CNVs), which are losses or gains of <b>chromosomal</b> regions greater than 1 kb in length. CNVs are mentioned with the <b>chromosomal</b> band(s) they involve and their genome sequence coordinates. CNVs can be nonrecurrent and recurrent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chromosomal</b> translocations: {{interchange}} {{of genetic}} parts from nonhomologous chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC)-end {{sequencing}} (end-sequence profiling): Identifies <b>chromosomal</b> breakpoints by {{generating a}} BAC library from a cancer genome and sequencing their ends. The BAC clones that contain chromosome aberrations have end sequences {{that do not}} map to a similar region of the reference genome, thus identifying a <b>chromosomal</b> breakpoint.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chromosomal</b> aberrations are {{disruptions}} in {{the normal}} <b>chromosomal</b> content of a cell and are {{a major cause of}} genetic conditions in humans, such as Down syndrome, although most aberrations have little to no effect. Some chromosome abnormalities do not cause disease in carriers, such as translocations, or <b>chromosomal</b> inversions, although they may lead to a higher chance of bearing a child with a chromosome disorder. Abnormal numbers of chromosomes or chromosome sets, called aneuploidy, may be lethal or may give rise to genetic disorders. Genetic counseling is offered for families that may carry a chromosome rearrangement.|$|E
25|$|Vinyl {{chloride}} is a mutagen having clastogenic effects which affect lymphocyte <b>chromosomal</b> structure.|$|E
25|$|CML was {{the first}} cancer {{to be linked to}} a clear genetic abnormality, the <b>chromosomal</b> {{translocation}} known as the Philadelphia chromosome. This <b>chromosomal</b> abnormality is so named because it was first discovered and described in 1960 by two scientists from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA: Peter Nowell of the University of Pennsylvania and David Hungerford of Fox Chase Cancer Center.|$|E
25|$|Deletions {{of large}} <b>chromosomal</b> regions, leading to {{loss of the}} genes within those regions.|$|E
25|$|Down syndrome, {{a common}} <b>chromosomal</b> disease, {{is caused by}} trisomy of {{chromosome}} 21.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{disorders}} or {{diseases are}} all congenital, {{though they may}} not be expressed or recognized until later in life. Genetic diseases may be divided into single-gene defects, multiple-gene disorders, or <b>chromosomal</b> defects. Single-gene defects may arise from abnormalities of both copies of an autosomal gene (a recessive disorder) or of only one of the two copies (a dominant disorder). Some conditions result from deletions or abnormalities of a few genes located contiguously on a chromosome. <b>Chromosomal</b> disorders involve the loss or duplication of larger portions of a chromosome (or an entire chromosome) containing hundreds of genes. Large <b>chromosomal</b> abnormalities always produce effects on many different body parts and organ systems.|$|E

25|$|<b>Chromosomal</b> regions can adopt {{stable and}} {{heritable}} alternative states resulting in bistable gene expression without {{changes to the}} DNA sequence. Epigenetic control {{is often associated with}} alternative covalent modifications of histones. The stability and heritability of states of larger <b>chromosomal</b> regions are suggested to involve positive feedback where modified nucleosomes recruit enzymes that similarly modify nearby nucleosomes. A simplified stochastic model for this type of epigenetics is found here.|$|E
25|$|Another way for {{bacteria}} {{to defend against}} phage infection is by having <b>chromosomal</b> islands. A subtype of <b>chromosomal</b> islands called phage-inducible <b>chromosomal</b> island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication. The mechanisms that induce PICI excision and how PICI inhibits phage replication are not well understood. One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a V. cholera PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be homologous to the 1-F system found in Yersinia pestis. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.|$|E

25|$|Dobzhansky {{continues}} {{the theme of}} continuity between the laboratory and nature in chapter 4, showing that variations in the structure, arrangement and number of chromosomes occur in both the laboratory and nature. He shows that <b>chromosomal</b> translocation, a rearrangement of parts in chromosomes, accounts for racial differences in Datura stramonium (jimson-weed). <b>Chromosomal</b> inversion, a reversal of a segment, {{is the basis for}} differentiation in Drosophila. He also points out that these effects demonstrate that the chromosome parts are interdependent.|$|E
