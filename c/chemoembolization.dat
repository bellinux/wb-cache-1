25|$|Transcatheter {{arterial}} <b>chemoembolization</b> (TACE) {{is usually}} performed for unresectable tumors or {{as a temporary}} treatment while waiting for liver transplant. TACE is done by injecting an antineoplastic drug (e.g. cisplatin) mixed with a radio-opaque contrast (e.g. Lipiodol) and an embolic agent (e.g. Gelfoam) into the right or left hepatic artery via the groin artery. The goal of the procedure it to restrict the tumorâ€™s vascular supply while supplying a targeted chemotherapeutic agent. TACE {{has been shown to}} increase survival and to downstage HCC in patients who exceed the Milan criteria for liver transplant. Patients who undergo the procedure may are followed with CT scans and may need additional TACE procedures if the tumor persists. As of 2005, multiple trials show objective tumor responses and slowed tumor progression but questionable survival benefit compared to supportive care; greatest benefit seen in people with preserved liver function, absence of vascular invasion, and smallest tumors. TACE is not suitable for big tumors (>8nbsp&cm), the presence of portal vein thrombus, tumors with a portal-systemic shunt, and patients with poor liver function.|$|E

50|$|Transcatheter {{arterial}} <b>chemoembolization</b> {{has most}} widely {{been applied to}} HCC for patients who {{are not eligible for}} surgery. TACE has been shown to increase survival in patients with intermediate HCC by BCLC criteria. It has also been used as an alternative to surgery for resectable early stage HCC and in patients with regional recurrence of the tumor after previous resection. TACE may also be used to downstage HCC in patients who exceed the Milan criteria for liver transplantation. Other treated malignancies include neuroendocrine tumors, ocular melanoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and sarcoma. Transcatheter arterial <b>chemoembolization</b> plays a palliative role in patients with metastatic colon carcinoma. There is a possible benefit for liver-dominant metastases from other primary malignancies.|$|E
50|$|Radiotherapy is {{not often}} used in HCC because the liver is not {{tolerant}} to radiation.

50|$|Lipiodol (labeled Ethiodol in the USA), {{also known}} as ethiodized oil, is a poppyseed oil used by {{injection}} as a radio-opaque contrast agent {{that is used to}} outline structures in radiological investigations. It is used in <b>chemoembolization</b> applications as a contrast agent in follow-up imaging. Lipiodol is also used in lymphangiography, the imaging of the lymphatic system. It has an additional use in gastric variceal obliteration as a dilutant that does not affect polymerization of cyanoacrylate.|$|E
50|$|Treatment can {{consist of}} surgery (hepatectomy), {{chemotherapy}} and/or therapies specifically {{aimed at the}} liver like radiofrequency ablation, transcatheter arterial <b>chemoembolization,</b> selective internal radiation therapy and irreversible electroporation. For most patients no effective treatment exists because both lobes are usually involved, making surgical resection impossible. Younger patients with metastases from colorectal cancer confined to one lobe of the liver and up to 4 in number may be treated by partial hepatectomy. In selected cases, chemotherapy may be given systemically or via hepatic artery.|$|E
50|$|For optimal results, {{combination}} {{treatment with}} systemic or regionally infused chemo or biological therapy should be considered. Prior to surgery, cytotoxic agents such as oxaliplatin given systemically for colorectal metastasis, or <b>chemoembolization</b> for hepatocellular carcinoma can significantly decrease {{the size of}} the tumor bulk, allowing then for resections which would remove a segment or wedge portion of the liver only. These procedures can also be aided by application of liver clamp (Lin or Chu liver clamp; Pilling no.604113-61995) in order to minimize blood loss.|$|E

50|$|In 1972, {{surgical}} ligation of the {{hepatic artery}} {{was first used}} to treat recurrent hepatic tumors followed by infusion of 5-fluorouracil into the portal vein. Due to the liver's dual blood supply from the hepatic artery and portal vein, interruption of the flow through the hepatic artery was demonstrated to be safe in patients. Tumor embolization eventually developed, blocking the vascular supply to a tumor by primarily endovascular approaches. The application of angiography with embolization followed, and the administration of chemotherapeutic agents with embolic particles evolved into transcatheter arterial <b>chemoembolization.</b>|$|E
50|$|Intrahepatic abscess (treated by {{percutaneous}} drainage) and gallbladder ischemia {{are extremely}} rare. Rising bilirubin {{is a warning}} sign of irreversible hepatic necrosis, generally occurring {{in the setting of}} cirrhosis. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of significant hepatic toxicity, <b>chemoembolization</b> should be restricted to a single lobe or major branch of the hepatic artery at one time. The patient may be brought back after 1 month, once toxicities and abnormal chemistries have resolved, to complete the procedure in the opposite lobe. Retreatment of new lesions may be necessary, if patients fulfill the original eligibility criteria.|$|E
50|$|Systemic {{chemotherapeutics}} are not routinely used in HCC, although local chemotherapy {{may be used}} in {{a procedure}} known as transarterial <b>chemoembolization.</b> In this procedure, cytotoxic drugs such as doxorubicin or cisplatin with lipiodol are administered and the arteries supplying the liver are blocked by gelatin sponge or other particles. Because most systemic drugs have no efficacy in the treatment of HCC, research into the molecular pathways involved in the production of liver cancer produced sorafenib, a targeted therapy drug that prevents cell proliferation and blood cell growth. Sorafenib obtained FDA approval for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in November 2007. This drug provides a survival benefit for advanced HCC.|$|E

5000|$|The {{effective}} {{therapeutic index}} {{can be affected}} by targeting, in which the therapeutic agent is concentrated in its area of effect. For example, in radiation therapy for cancerous tumors, shaping the radiation beam precisely to {{the profile of a}} tumor in the [...] "beam's eye view" [...] can increase the delivered dose without increasing toxic effects, though such shaping might not change the therapeutic index. Similarly, chemotherapy or radiotherapy with infused or injected agents can be made more efficacious by attaching the agent to an oncophilic substance, as is done in peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors and in <b>chemoembolization</b> or radioactive microspheres therapy for liver tumors and metastases. This concentrates the agent in the targeted tissues and lowers its concentration in others, increasing efficacy and lowering toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Other {{treatments}} include percutaneous ablation and <b>chemoembolization.</b> The {{most widely}} used ablation techniques for lung cancer are radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, and microwave ablation. Ablation may be an option for patients whose tumors are near {{the outer edge of}} the lungs. Nodules less than 1 cm from the trachea, main bronchi, oesophagus and central vessels should be excluded from RFA given high risk of complications and frequent incomplete ablation. Additionally, lesions greater than 5 cm should be excluded and lesions 3 to 5 cm should be considered with caution given high risk of recurrence. As a minimally invasive procedure, it can be a safer alternative for patients who are poor candidates for surgery due to co-morbidities or limited lung function. A study comparing thermal ablation to sublobar resection as treatment for early stage NSCLC in older patients found no difference in overall survival of the patients. It is possible that RFA followed by radiation therapy has a survival benefit due to synergysm of the two mechanisms of cell destruction.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Transarterial <b>chemoembolization</b> is the {{treatment}} of choice for intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. However, there are no clear data supporting transarterial <b>chemoembolization</b> vs. transarterial embolization or regarding the best chemotherapeutic agent, which may suggest a preponderant role of ischemia over chemotherapeutic action. This study sought to evaluate the radiological response and outcome of transarterial <b>chemoembolization</b> modified by n-butyl cyanoacrylate addition compared to conventional transarterial <b>chemoembolization</b> in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review identified forty-seven patients who underwent modified <b>chemoembolization</b> and thirty-three who underwent conventional <b>chemoembolization</b> between June 2006 and December 2011. The radiological response was reassessed using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. The sustained complete response, time to progression and overall survival rates were also analyzed. RESULTS: Complete response rates were significantly higher in patients who had undergone modified <b>chemoembolization</b> {{compared to those who}} had undergone conventional treatment (61. 7 % and 24. 3 %, respectively; p < 0. 001). The rate of sustained complete response was significantly higher in the modified <b>chemoembolization</b> group compared to the conventional <b>chemoembolization</b> group (median of 236 and 37 days, respectively; p < 0. 001). Time to progression was significantly higher in the modified <b>chemoembolization</b> group compared to the conventional <b>chemoembolization</b> group (median of 424 and 201 days, respectively; p = 0. 042). Overall survival rates revealed no difference between patients who received modified <b>chemoembolization</b> and conventional <b>chemoembolization</b> (median of 483 and 399 days, respectively; p = 0. 316). CONCLUSION: Transarterial <b>chemoembolization</b> modified by n-butyl cyanoacrylate addition was superior to conventional transarterial <b>chemoembolization</b> in terms of the radiological response in the first imaging control. Although the sustained complete response and time to progression rates were higher for the modified <b>chemoembolization</b> group, no differences in overall survival rates were observed...|$|E
40|$|This randomized, {{controlled}} trial {{assessed the}} efficacy of transarterial Lipiodol (Lipiodol Ultrafluide, Laboratoire Guerbet, Aulnay-Sous-Bois, France) <b>chemoembolization</b> in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. From March 1996 to October 1997, 80 out of 279 Asian patients with newly diagnosed unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma fulfilled the entry criteria and randomly were assigned to treatment with <b>chemoembolization</b> using a variable dose of an emulsion of cisplatin in Lipiodol and gelatin-sponge particles injected through the hepatic artery (<b>chemoembolization</b> group, 40 patients) or symptomatic treatment (control group, 40 patients). One patient assigned to the control group secondarily was excluded because of unrecognized systemic metastasis. <b>Chemoembolization</b> was repeated every 2 to 3 months unless there was evidence of contraindications or progressive disease. Survival was the main end point. The <b>chemoembolization</b> group received a total of 192 courses of <b>chemoembolization</b> with a median of 4. 5 (range, 1 - 15) courses per patient. <b>Chemoembolization</b> resulted in a marked tumor response, and the actuarial survival was significantly better in the <b>chemoembolization</b> group (1 year, 57 %; 2 years, 31 %; 3 years, 26 %) than {{in the control group}} (1 year, 32 %; 2 years, 11 %; 3 years, 3 %; P =. 002). When adjustments for baseline variables that were prognostic on univariate analysis were made with a multivariate Cox model, the survival benefit of <b>chemoembolization</b> remained significant (relative risk of death, 0. 49; 95 % CI, 0. 29 - 0. 81; P =. 006). Although death from liver failure was more frequent in patients who received <b>chemoembolization,</b> the liver functions of the survivors were not significantly different. In conclusion, in Asian patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, transarterial Lipiodol <b>chemoembolization</b> significantly improves survival and is an effective form of treatment. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To compare short- and {{long-term}} clinical outcomes after conventional transarterial <b>chemoembolization</b> and drug-eluting bead (DEB) transarterial <b>chemoembolization</b> in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and Methods: Patients with unresectable HCC unsuitable for ablative therapies {{were randomly assigned}} to undergo conventional or DEB <b>chemoembolization.</b> The primary endpoints of the study were safety, toxicity, and tumor response at 1 month. Secondary endpoints were number of repeated <b>chemoembolization</b> cycles, time to recurrence and local recurrence, time to radiologic progression, and survival. Results: In total, 67 patients (mean age, 70 y Â± 7. 7) were evaluated. Mean follow-up was 816 days Â± 361. Two periprocedural major complications occurred (2. 9 %) that were treated by medical therapy without the need for other interventions. A significant increase in alanine aminotransferase levels 24 hours after treatment was reported, which was significantly greater after conventional <b>chemoembolization</b> (n = 34) than after DEB <b>chemoembolization</b> (n = 33; preprocedure, 60 IU Â± 44 vs 74 IU Â± 62, respectively; at 24 h, 216 IU Â± 201 vs 101 IU Â± 89, respectively; P = 0. 007). No other differences were observed in liver toxicity between groups. At 1 month, complete and partial tumor response rates were 70. 6 % and 29. 4 %, respectively, in the conventional <b>chemoembolization</b> group and 51. 5 % and 48. 5 %, respectively, in the DEB <b>chemoembolization</b> group. No differences were observed between groups in time to recurrence and local recurrence, radiologic progression, and survival. Conclusions: Conventional <b>chemoembolization</b> and DEB <b>chemoembolization</b> have a limited impact on liver function on short- {{and long-term}} follow-up and are associated with favorable clinical outcomes...|$|E
