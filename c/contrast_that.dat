5|$|Banksia integrifolia, {{commonly}} known as coast banksia, is a species of tree that grows along {{the east coast of}} Australia. One of the most widely distributed Banksia species, it occurs between Victoria and Central Queensland in a broad range of habitats, from coastal dunes to mountains. It is highly variable in form, but is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (82ft) in height. Its leaves have dark green upper surfaces and white undersides, a <b>contrast</b> <b>that</b> can be striking on windy days.|$|E
5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I <b>contrast</b> <b>that</b> of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E

25|$|Contrast {{is defined}} as the {{difference}} in brightness between two stimuli, divided by the sum of brightness of both stimuli. Contrast sensitivity is the inverse of the smallest <b>contrast</b> <b>that</b> can be detected, a contrast sensitivity of 100 means that the smallest <b>contrast</b> <b>that</b> can be detected is 1%. Birds have comparably low contrast sensitivity to mammals. Humans have been shown to detect contrasts as low as 0.5-1%, whereas most birds tested have require ca 10% contrast to show a behavioural response. A contrast sensitivity function describes an animal's ability to resolve detect the contrast of patterns of different spatial frequency (detail). For stationary viewing experiments the contrast sensitivity is highest for a medium spatial frequency and lower for higher and lower spatial frequencies.|$|E

40|$|AbstractVisual {{responses}} {{are known to}} depend on stimulus contrast and not simply on the absolute levels of retinal illumination. Here, we have determined the <b>contrasts</b> <b>that</b> mammalian retinal ganglion cells and lateral geniculate neurones (LGN) are likely to encounter in real world scenes. Local contrasts were calculated in 135 calibrated images {{of a variety of}} real world scenes using <b>contrast</b> operators <b>that</b> closely mirror the characteristic receptive-field organisation of mammalian retinal ganglion cells and LGN neurones. We have found that the frequency distribution of the calculated local contrasts has a pronounced peak at zero <b>contrast</b> and <b>that</b> it tails off roughly exponentially with increasing positive and negative contrasts; about 90 % of the contrasts in the images were within the equivalent range of ± 0. 5 Michelson and Weber contrasts.

500|$|Three weeks later, both {{entities}} {{participated in}} a march against the measures of the Fortuño administration along groups that fell outside the independence movement, which interrupted the traffic in several routes and converged at Plaza Las Americas (a mall owned by the Fonalledas family, prominent members of the Puerto Rico Republican Party, to which Fortuño is affiliated). The following week the 2009 Cataño oil refinery fire began. The Macheteros felt that expressions made by government functionaries labeling protestors as [...] "terrorists" [...] and the subsequent investigation of the fire as potentially intentional were intended to link separate events and degrade the public perception of the protests. Believing {{that the federal government}} could be executing a plan to [...] "escalate the persecution against students (in reference to animosity between the UPR and the government which eventually led to a strike), worker unions and independentists [...] ", the EPB warned of four possible ways in which such an approach could benefit the government; by misdirecting the attention away from the administration, by trying to create a <b>contrast</b> <b>that</b> would portray Fortuño positively, by intimidating potential protestors and by persecuting them.
