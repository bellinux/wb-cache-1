After several mergers in 1945, including one between US Passamonte and AP Messina, the club AS Messina subsequently emerged as a post-war representative of Messina.

25|$|In close-quarters {{fighting}} {{there is}} no more deadly weapon than the knife. In choosing a knife there are two important factors to bear in mind: balance and keenness. The hilt should fit easily in your hand, and the blade should not be so heavy that it tends to drag the hilt from your fingers in a loose grip. It is essential that the blade have a sharp stabbing point and good cutting edges, because an artery torn through (as against a <b>clean</b> <b>cut)</b> tends to contract and stop the bleeding. If a main artery is cleanly severed, the wounded man will quickly lose consciousness and die.|$|E

Backlund's <b>clean</b> <b>cut</b> look and technical approach made him a natural face, and he quickly got over with the fans. After leaving the AWA, Backlund traveled the United States, working for the National Wrestling Alliance in its various territories. In 1974, Backlund wrestled in Texas, for Dory Funk, Jr. and Terry Funk's Amarillo promotion. In March, he defeated Terry Funk for the NWA Western States Heavyweight Championship (the promotion's top title). Backlund held it for two months, before losing it to Karl Von Steiger in May.|$|E

25|$|Inserts: Table saws have a {{changeable}} insert in {{the table}} through which the blade projects. Purchasable inserts are usually made out of metal. Zero-Clearance inserts can be made of a sawable material such as plastic or wood. When a Zero-Clearance insert is initially inserted, the blade is raised through the insert creating the slot. This creates a slot with no gaps around the blade. The zero clearance insert helps prevent tearout by providing support for wood fibers {{right next to the}} blade thus helping to make a very <b>clean</b> <b>cut.</b> Other inserts can be bought or created in the same manner, such as a dado insert.|$|E
25|$|Those who breed Tollers for {{conformation}} shows {{consider the}} head (<b>clean</b> <b>cut,</b> slightly wedge-shaped) {{to be an}} important feature, and believe it should resemble that of a fox, and must never be blocky like that of a Golden Retriever. The ears are triangular and set high and well back from the skull. The pigment on a toller's nose, lips and eye rims should match, and should be either black (which normally fades with age) or liver, blending into the coat. Lips fit fairly tightly around the mouth. The correct bite is a scissor bite, full dentition is required. Jaws are strong enough to carry a large bird, but Tollers must have a soft mouth too. Eyes are set well apart, almond shaped, medium-sized. Colour, amber to dark brown. Expression is friendly, alert and intelligent.|$|E
25|$|In spring 1928, Disney {{lost control}} of the Oswald {{character}}, and much of his staff was hired away; Disney left Universal soon afterwards. He promised never to work with a character he did not own ever again. Disney asked Iwerks, who stayed on, to start drawing up new character ideas. Iwerks tried sketches of frogs, dogs, and cats, but none of these appealed to Disney. A female cow and male horse were created at this time by Iwerks, but were also rejected. They would later turn up as Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar. Ub Iwerks eventually got inspiration from an old drawing. In 1925, Hugh Harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of Walt Disney. Then, on a train ride back from a failed business meeting, Walt Disney came up with the original sketch for the character that would eventually be called Mickey Mouse. Afterwards, Disney took the sketch to Iwerks. In turn, he drew a more <b>clean</b> <b>cut</b> and refined version of Mickey, but one that still followed the original sketch.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} {{multitude of}} scholastic {{studies have shown}} that the linguistic styles of GLB and straight people are not mutually exclusive. Munson et al. (2006), for instance, examined the gradient nature of perceived sexual orientation by having 40 listeners rate 44 talkers' sexual orientation on a five-point equally appearing interval scale. The 44 talkers included equal number of GLB and straight people. When averaged across the 40 listeners, ratings for individual talkers showed some overlap between GLB and straight people. For example, the two men who were tied with the most-gay average ratings included one self-identified straight man, and one self-identified gay man. While there are group level differences between GLB and straight people in the gay soundness of their voices, overlap does exist, providing a serious challenge to a simple model in which speech differences were the inevitable consequence of sexual orientation. The fact that there is no <b>clean</b> <b>cut</b> between the linguistic patterns of GLB and straight people suggests that too many generations in the study of language and gender can be dangerous.|$|E

It's far {{more in line}} with the intensity of stuff on Dookie than the ballads on American Idiot". Thomas Smith at NME observed: [...] "Musically, it's classic Green Day; limited power chords used to furious effect, a maelstrom of abrasive punk rock that's aided by Mike Dirnt's rumbling bass and Tré Cool's on-point drumming. On this evidence, Green Day {{have found a way to}} stay relevant." [...] Joseph R. Atilano, of Inquirer.net, concurred and said the song [...] "does not sound 'glossy', 'too <b>clean</b> <b>cut</b> around the edges' nor overly polished".

[...] "Yes, the [...] Californian. That wasn't a compromise to mainstream filmmaking. That was really more about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film," [...] stated Cameron. He said there were aspects of retelling the sinking that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but turned out to be less important as the film evolved.

2500|$|Laser cutting {{may be used}} to form {{intricate}} designs from PMMA sheets. PMMA vaporizes to gaseous compounds (including its monomers) upon laser cutting, so a very <b>clean</b> <b>cut</b> is made, {{and cutting}} is performed very easily. However, the pulsed lasercutting introduces high internal stresses along the cut edge, which on exposure to solvents produce undesirable [...] "stress-crazing" [...] at the cut edge and several millimetres deep. Even ammonium-based glass-cleaner and almost everything short of soap-and-water produces similar undesirable crazing, sometimes over the entire surface of the cut parts, at great distances from the stressed edge.

2500|$|Final {{opinions}} on the album were mixed. Hope called it [...] "an easy listen with the same soothing vocals and <b>clean</b> <b>cut</b> sing-a-long choruses we've grown to love. Overall a great offering but not overly addictive." [...] Beringer praised the band's growth in musicianship {{in the years since}} From Here to Infirmary, but also commented that This Addiction [...] "could be polarizing to fans, splitting them into three groups: fans who love the album because {{it goes back to the}} band's roots, fans who dislike this album because they may think it's a cheap imitation of older days, and the fans who might think this is a step backwards from the previous album." [...] Heisel concluded that [...] "while This Addiction might not be perfect, it's a more than respectable entry into the band's already sizeable canon, proving that though they may be in that rarified group of punk-rock lifers, Alkaline Trio aren't done evolving yet." [...] Apar stated that although the album was purported to be a return to the early sound of Goddamnit, he found it more comparable to From Here to Infirmary [...] "since the end result is still the same polished album full of vaguely gothic and bloody references where characters like Draculina live -- no real bitterness, sore-throat defiance, or endearing heartache to be found." [...] Though complimenting [...] "This Addiction" [...] and [...] "Off the Map" [...] as strong songs, he felt that the album failed to live up to its expectations as a return to roots: [...] "Alkaline Trio just can't seem to recapture the spirit of their early days, when purpose and emotion fueled every note. Instead, one is left with totally competent -- and at times, yes, catchy -- songs that ring just a bit too hollow compared to the urgent leave-it-all-on-the-floor guts of those earliest releases [...] despite the polished and punchy singalong choruses, This Addiction is really just more of the same recycled melodies from the Trio rather than any sort of rebirth." [...] Andrew Kelham of Rock Sound agreed that the album did not succeed in recapturing the band's early sound, but was a strong effort nonetheless: [...] "Alkaline Trio aren't naïve punk rockers from the Chicago suburbs anymore, as a result this album fails to recapture that innocence but succeeds in creating another strong body of work that the group can be proud of." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin remarked that the [...] "cozier confines" [...] of an independent label [...] "appear to have put the band at ease" [...] and that their [...] "hooky, blood-soaked bad-love allegories [...] satisfy like heartburn-inducing comfort food." [...] French concluded that [...] "This Addiction isn't so much a 'return to form,' but rather a summary--a sonic scrapbook of sorts that carefully documents their entire career, from sour home Chicago to the dressing rooms of Late Night with Conan O'Brien." ...|$|E
