40|$|Increasing industrial, military, {{and space}} {{requirements}} for certain fission products place emphasis on large-scale methods for their recovery from waste liquors {{produced by the}} fuel recovery processes. With development of organic extractants for separating and recovering these fission products, solvent extraction offers a versatile alternative to ion-exchange, precipitation, and crystallization procedures heretofore used for small-scale recoveries. A process flowsheet was developed for the recovery of strontium and mixed rare earths from adjusted Purex 1 WW solution {{by the use of}} di(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D 2 EHPA). After adding tartrate t complex the iron and caustic to adjust the pH to 6, strontium and rare earths are co-extracted and then co-stripped with nitric acid in the first cycle. In additional D 2 EHPA extraction cycles, they are isolated as concentrated fractions. The mixed rare earths from this process can be treated by tributyl phosphate (TBP) extraction to separate the individual rare earth elements of which promethium and cerium are of greatest interest. Zirconium [...] niobium also may be recovered with D 2 EHPA from acidic waste liquors. An amine pretreatment extraction process was developed for removing nitric acid, iron sulfate, zirconium [...] niobium, and ruthenium from waste solutions to furnish a feed liquor more amenable to subsequent processes for recovering fission products. The separate recovery of ruthenium, zirconium [...] niobium, and rare earths may also be possible by amine extraction. A process based on the use of substituted phenols was developed for recovering cesium from alkaline waste solutions. These compounds are selective extractants for cesium, giving high decontamination from other fission products and sodium, and they are readily stripped with dilute nitric acid. Previous studies also outlined methods for recovering neptunium, plutonium, and technetium with solvents similar to those described. When appropriately <b>cornbined,</b> these developments offer a versatile integrated solvent extraction flowsheet for the recovery of all important fission products and other components from waste liquors.

40|$|The recent {{banning of}} the most active {{chemical}} nematicides raised root-knot nematodes (RKN) as the major problem of vegetable growing in the south-east of France, with over 40 % of horticultural farms affected. Resistant (R) cultivars successfully limit nematode attacks of the crop itself and reduce nematode abundance in soil in the short term. But their use in commercial fields faces two major constraints: (1) the limited number of cultivated species with RKN R-genes available (tomate. pepper), which would lead to major changes in crop rotations with socio-economic constraints; (2) the emergence of virulent root-knot nematode populations, able to overcome the resistance conferred by some of the R-genes. Recent research showed that the durability of the resistance per se was possibly increased with an optimal choice of the R-gene or allele combination, and of the genetic background in which the major R-genes where introgressed. However, the requirement for agronomic performance, does not always allow the breeder to fully use the genetic diversity available in R-genes and genetic backgrounds. ln such cases, spatio-temporal deployment strategies of resistant cultivars in the rotation were proposed and provided some success. But combination of genetic resistance with cultivation practices including multicrop rotations, intercultural management and/or prophylactic treatments was poorly tested for its ability to provide complementary selection pressures on the pathogen populations and to increase the durability of the protection. The project aims at identifying innovative strategies across the agrosystem, <b>cornbining</b> varietal resistance in crop rotations with agronomic practices, for a sustainable control of RKN that infect vegetable crops in protected crop systems. This pilot and demonstrative project involves analytical and systemic aspects: il the validation of previous results on the durability of RKN genetic resistance in tomato and pepper by long-term experiments in research stations and in farms, ii/ the impact of agronomic practices on the parasitic pressure in the soil and its contribution in the increase of resistance durability, and iii/ the impact of such innovations on the yield and the economie viability for protected crop systems in a Mediterranean climate. The added value here is to combine together currently dispersed approaches based on synergistic and long-term effects, towards a satisfying level of nematode control over pluri-annual crop sequences. The diversity of partners (research, experimental stations, technical institutes) and associated forces (growers' development structures, 'chambres d'agriculture') brings ail the complementary expertise needed for answering specifie short-term questions as weil as generic mid-long term expectations.

40|$|Resumo: As larvas das espécies Chrysomya albiceps, Chrysomya chloropyga e Chrysomya megacephala foram inicialmente utilizadas neste estudo. A espécie C. chloropyga, foi selecionada por seu comportamento semelhante em dieta natural (carcaça) e na dieta de leite e levedura (STOFFOLANO, 1974). Verificou-se inicialmente, o efeito de diferentes niveis de proteína na dieta, no desenvolvimento das larvas, utilizando-se a:rcD fonte proteica leite em pó {{integral}}, leite em pó integral combinado com levedura, caseína e caseína combinada com levedura, nos níveis de 2, 4, 6, 8 e 10 %. Nas dietas de leite e de leite e levedura, as porcentagens de ganho de peso foram proporcionais ao nível de proteína das dietas nos níveis 2 e 4 %. Nos níveis 6, 8 e 10 %, não houve crescimento, provavelmente devido à alta concentração de sólidos nas dietas. Com a utilização de caseína e caseína combinada com levedura, obtivemos respostas de crescimento proporcionais ao níve 1 de proteína das dietas até o nível 8 % para as dietas de caseína e levedura e até o nível 10 %, para as dietas de caseína. Como as dietas contendo levedura apresentaram resultados superiores aos obtidos somente com leite ou caseína como fontes proteicas e, sendo levedura uma fonte rica em ácido ribonucleico, este substituiu a levedura nas dietas de caseína, obtendo-se resultados superiores aos até então obtidos. - A série de dietas contendo caseína e RNA foi por este motivo utilizada como padrão nos ensaios subseqüentes. Verificamos então, respostas das larvas quando proteinas de diferentes origens eram adicionadas às dietas. No primeiro grupo de dietas as farinhas das leguminosas feijão e soja foram utilizadas, testando-se também o efeito de tratamento térmico e o de suplementação com metionina no desenvolvimento das larvas. A suplementação de feijão crú com metionina não aumentou a porcentagem de ganho de peso das larvas, o que ocorreu após o tratamento térmico e também com a suplementação da farinha tratada. Nas dietas com farinha de soja crua, quando suplementadas com metionina, as larvas apresentaram porcentagem de ganho de peso maior do que as dietas não suplementadas. O tratamento térmico também melhorou a qualidade das dietas. Os cereais arroz, milho e trigo foram utilizados como contendo cereal como única fonte proteica, para milho e trigo. A suplementação das dietas com aminoácidos limitantes produziu resultados superiores ou próximos aos obtidos com as dietas complementadas. Um último ensaio foi realizado utilizando-se ovo integral liofilizado como fonte proteica, obtendo-se resultados bastante satisfatórios, embora as dietas não contivessem RNA adicionado, confirmando que o desempenho da dieta depende do balanço adequado de nutrientesAbstract:The {{growth of}} Chrysomya albiceps, Chrysomya chloropyga and Chrysomya megaceplala larvae toward a natural (mice carcass) and milk-yeast diets was studied. The larva of C. chloropyga {{was selected because}} of its identical growth in both diets. Experiments were carried out to study the effect of different protein levels and different protein sources as well. Four pratein sources were utilized in this study: l) dried whole milk, 2) dried whole milk-plusyeast, 3) casein and 4) casein <b>cornbined</b> with yeast. The protein levels were 2,	 4, 6, 8 and 10 % for {{each one of the}} diets. In the dried whole milk and dried whole milk-plus-yeast the gain in body weight was proportional to the protein content of the diets, at the levels af 2 and 4 %. At 6, 8 and 10 % the growth was impaired, probably due to the high solid concentration in the diets. When the caseio and the casein-plus-yeast diets were utilized, the growth was proportional to the protein content of the diets up to the leveI of 8 %, {{in the case of the}} casein plus-yeast diet, and up to 10 % for the casein diet. When yeast was incorporated to the diets, the growth rates were always higher than those obtained without it. 	This result was not surprising sinee yeasts are a good natural source of ribonucleic acid. The addition of RNA to the casein diet showed even better results, in terms of growth, than the casein-plus-yeast diet. For this reason, the casein diet to which RNA was added, was taken as the standard diet throughout this study. The effect af different protein saurces on the growth rates of C. chloropyga larvas was investigated in another set of experiments. The ability of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and soy-bean (Glycine max) proteins to support grawth as well as the effect of heat treatment and L-methionine supplementation were studied. The larvae did not respond to the supplementation of the unheated bean protein with L-methionine, however the growth rates were higher when the flour was heat-treated and when the heated-treated flour was supplemented with L-methionine. In the case of unheated soy flour, there was a better growth response after L-methionine addition; heated soy flour supported higher growth rates than the unheat flour both with and without L-methionine addition. Rice corn and wheat were also testes as protein sources for the C. Chloropyga larvae. Corn and wheat when supplemented with limiting amino acids elicited a better growth response than the unsupplemented sources. Supplementation of corn, rice and wheat with bean and soy-bean protein was beneficial to the growth of C. Chloropyga larvae. Dried whole egg vlas also tested, giving higher growth rates when compared with any other protein sourc...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Three genetically {{different}} dwarf cultivars {{of spring}} wheat were evaluated as {{potential sources of}} short stature to use in a wheat improvement program. The study involved a five parent diallel cross which included a semidwarf, a standard height and three dwarf cultivars. The genetic sources of dwarfism included a Norma 10 derivative named Vicam 71, a derived line from Tom Thumb called Tordo, and Olesen dwarf. Experimental material consisted of parental lines, F₁, F₂, and both backcrosses to the parents space planted in a randomized block design. The agronomic characters measured on an individual plant basis were: (1) plant height, (2) days to heading, (3) number of tillers, (4) number of spikelets per spike, (5) head length, (6) days to maturity, (7) grain yield, (8) harvest index, (9) kernel weight, (10) number of kernels per spikelet, (11) rachis internode length, (12) grain filling period and, (13) head grain weight. Estimates of gene action were determined by heterosis, heterobeltiosis, broad and narrow sense heritabilities and combining ability analyses. Associations among traits were estimated by phenotypic, environmental, and genotypic correlations as well as path-coefficient analysis for grain yield and eight of the variables. There were significant differences among the parental lines, their crosses, and generations for all traits measured. Either partial dominance for tallness or no dominance was manifested for those crosses involving the dwarf cultivars Vicam 71 and Olesen. Tordo, when crossed to taller wheats showed dominance for short stature. All three genetic sources of dwarfism and their resulting progenies manifested desirable agronomic characteristics. Vicam 71 was a good parent in terms of grain yield and number of tillers per plant. Tordo was the best source for {{increasing the number of}} spikelets per spike, kernel weight and head grain weight. Olesen was a good progenitor for increasing number of kernels per spikelet. All three dwarf cultivars displayed some advantage(s) over the other two and all could be used to breed short statured wheats with a possibility of success. Plant height did not appear to have a direct effect on plant grain yield in any of the 10 crosses. With the exception of number of tillers per plant and grain yield, a major proportion of the phenotypic variability observed for all characters studied was due to genetic factors. A large portion of the total genetic variability associated with days to heading, maturity, height, rachis internode, spikelet number, kernels per spikelet, kernel weight, and harvest index was mainly a result of additive gene action. Both additive and non-additive genetic effects were involved in the expression of grain filling period and head weight. The nonadditive portion of the genetic variance associated with tiller number and grain yield per plant was relatively large when compared with the additive portion. Therefore, selection for increased expression of tillers and yield should be delayed until the F₄ or later generations where a large degree of homozygosity has been obtained. The genetic correlations for individual crosses indicated that {{only a few of the}} traits studied were associated in the same manner in most or all the 10 hybridizations. High positive genetic correlations were found between plant grain yield vs tiller number and kernels per spikelet, tiller number vs days to maturity, kernels per spikelet vs head grain weight, plant height vs head weight, and head length vs rachis internode length. High negative genetic correlations were found between kernel weight vs days to maturity, plant height vs harvest index, and days to heading vs grain filling period. Most correlations among agronomic traits were different in value and/or sign from one cross to another suggesting different gene associations in the parental cultivars. Genetic correlations between components of yield showed this type of inconsistency. Therefore, grain yield could be increased by a combined increase of more than one component of yield without compensatory oscillation among them because tiller number, spikelet number, kernels per spikelet and kernel weight were often not correlated between one another and sometimes were positively correlated. Path-coefficients analysis indicated that number of tiller per plant had a high direct effect on grain yield in all crosses. With the exception of two crosses, indirect effects of this trait were negligible. In the latter two crosses tiller number had a high negative indirect effect on plant grain yield via head grain weight. Kernels per spikelet and kernel weight had no direct effects on grain yield but their indirect effects via head weight were positive and significant. Large amounts of additive gene action were observed in the expression of plant height. This trait was also highly negatively correlated with harvest index; therefore, phenotypic selection for restricted plant height would be useful in obtaining lines with high grain to straw ratios. In general, crosses that showed high specific combining ability effects involved parents with low general combining ability. However, there were some exceptions to this rule. Crosses of high x high and high x low general combiners presented high specific combining ability effects, suggesting that some additive gene action may be involved in the superior performance of these combinations. Also the F ₂ generation did not differ from the F₁ in assessing general <b>cornbining</b> ability. A wheat breeder should be aware of those genetic associations between agronomic traits that could be used to select superior cultivars. However, the genetic correlations in this study suggested that each cross represented a different set of gene associations depending upon the parents involved. If some progress is to be made in using the genetic variability available in the crop, the breeder should not try to select exactly the same type of plant from every cross. Every hybridization is potentially a source of better lines if they are well planned and the reasons they were made are remembered during selection. It is very important to realize what are the contributions of each parental line in a cross and what are the most important trait associations present in each parent. Superior rural genetic variability existing in the crop...|$|R
