5|$|A <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> registration, in United States {{trademark}} law, is {{a federal}} trademark registration of the same trademark to two or more unrelated parties, with each party having a registration limited to a distinct geographic area. Such a registration is achieved by filing a <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> application (or by converting an existing application to a <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> application) and then prevailing in a <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> proceeding before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ("TTAB"), which is a judicial body within the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). A <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> application may be filed {{with respect to a}} trademark which is already registered or otherwise in use by another party, but may be allowed to go forward based on the assertion that the existing use can co-exist with the new registration without causing consumer confusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{authority}} {{for this type}} of registration is set forth in the Lanham Act, which permits <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> registration where the <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> applicant made a good-faith adoption of the mark prior to the registrant filing an application for registration. Such registrations are most commonly achieved by agreement of the parties involved, although the USPTO must still determine that no confusion will be caused.|$|E
5|$|The senior {{registrant}} {{in such a}} proceeding has ample {{incentive to}} oppose the grant of a <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> registration, because a registered trademark is presumed to apply throughout the entire United States. Thus, the grant of a <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> registration carves out some geographic territory from the senior registrant's exclusive control.|$|E

5|$|Most <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> {{proceedings}} {{result in}} a legal settlement between the parties. Frequently, one party will surrender its <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each party may agree to geographic limitations on its use of the mark at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no confusion is likely. A benefit of such an agreement is that the parties can agree to terms {{beyond the scope of}} the TTAB's decision, such as specific restrictions on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer confusion is likely to result from the <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> registration. Even if both parties assert that no confusion is likely, the TTAB may still make findings of fact which demonstrate that confusion is likely, and deny registration to the junior user of the mark.|$|E
5|$|The {{availability}} of <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> registration is not commonly invoked, even where the applicant might stand {{an excellent chance}} of demonstrating the existence of geographically distinct markets. Proceedings before the TTAB, like proceedings before any court, can be expensive and time-consuming. A contested <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> proceeding may last {{for two or three}} years before the resolution of a claim, and the outcome will remain uncertain until the end. The outcome of the proceeding will then be subject to an appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or to a collateral challenge in a United States District Court.|$|E
5|$|The few {{courts that}} have {{considered}} the antitrust implications of <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> registration have determined {{that it does not}} raise any violation of antitrust laws. Although it is considered a violation of such laws for companies to agree to divide up geographic territories for the sale of goods, <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> agreements dividing up trademark territories are specifically provided for by Congress. Furthermore, even with such an agreement in place, a company can still sell competing products in the trademark territory of another company, so long as the intruding party sells that product under a different mark.|$|E

5|$|Even where a <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> {{registration}} is issued, the parties may eventually {{come to an}} agreement under which one party will surrender its registration.

5|$|A <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> {{registration}} can be {{very detailed}} in the geographic divisions laid down.

5|$|The {{biodegradation}} of methoxyflurane begins {{immediately after}} the onset of exposure. The kidney and liver toxicity observed after anesthetic doses is attributable {{to one or more}} metabolites produced by O-demethylation of methoxyflurane. Significant products of this catabolic process include methoxyfluoroacetic acid (MFAA), dichloroacetic acid (DCAA), and inorganic fluoride. Methoxyflurane nephrotoxicity is dose dependent and irreversible, resulting from O-demethylation of methoxyflurane to fluoride and DCAA. This effect is so predictable and reproducible that methoxyflurane now serves as a pharmacologic model of fluoride-related nephrotoxicity, one with which newer drugs are compared. It is not entirely clear whether the fluoride itself is toxic—it may simply be a surrogate measure for some other toxic metabolite. The concurrent formation of inorganic fluoride and DCAA is unique to methoxyflurane biotransformation compared with other volatile anesthetics, and this combination is more toxic than fluoride alone. This may explain why fluoride formation from methoxyflurane is associated with nephrotoxicity, while fluoride formation from other volatile anesthetics (such as enflurane and sevoflurane) is not. Furthermore, the <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity.|$|E

This qualitative study aimed to explore the experiences of being recruited to, and remaining in, ACT among recovering clients diagnosed with SMI and <b>concurrent</b> substance <b>use.</b> Methods Twenty semi-structured interviews were undertaken among 11 clients with SMI and <b>concurrent</b> substance <b>use</b> who were included in ACT teams. The inclusion criteria were SMI and <b>concurrent</b> substance <b>use</b> and improvement after a minimum of 12  months in treatment regarding one or several of the following parameters: quality of life, general functioning and substance use. Systematic text condensation was applied in the analyses. Results The experiences of building trust through enduring involvement and receiving benefits were most important for the acceptance of ACT by clients. A feeling of exclusiveness, perceiving ACT as a safety net and the clients’ own personal responsibility for taking part in the treatment were stated as the most important factors for remaining in treatment. Conclusions The implications {{of the results of the}} present study are that service providers have to prove that they can be trusted in the initial phase of the clients’ contact with the team. The feeling by clients with SMI and <b>concurrent</b> substance <b>use</b> that service providers in ACT believe they can improve their client’s quality of life, is of importance for feeling exclusive, having hope for the future and remaining in treatment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{logic of}} Owicki and Gries {{is a well}} known logic for verifying safety {{properties}} of <b>concurrent</b> programs. <b>Using</b> this logic, Feijen and van Gasteren describe a method for deriving concurrent programs based on safety.

We use a framework that combines the safety logic of Owicki and Gries, and the progress logic of UNITY. Our contributions improve the applicability of our earlier techniques by reducing the calculational overhead in the formal proofs and derivations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques, a derivation of Dekker’s mutual exclusion algorithm is presented.

40|$|The authors show that, for the {{weighted}} and unweighted {{version of the}} max-cut problem, there is a polynomial equivalent optimality test which improves a given suboptimal solution. For {{the weighted}} case, the proof uses rescaling techniques (for a given cut, the graph is modified by scaling {{the weight of the}} uncut edges by a factor 0 < lambda < 1) together with <b>concurrent</b> <b>uses</b> of an optimal testing oracle and binary search. As a corollary one gets, {{with the help of an}} optimality testing oracle, a polynomial-time heuristic for the weighted max-cut problem. For the unweighted case, the proof is much simpler, and the heuristic is now an exact algorithm. This implies that recognizing an optimal cut in an unweighted graph is NP-hard...|$|R
25|$|The <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> of opioids {{with other}} {{depressant}} {{drugs such as}} benzodiazepines or ethanol increases the rates of adverse events and overdose.

As examples, fluoxetine and paroxetine, inhibitors of these enzymes, are known to modestly increase mirtazapine levels, while carbamazepine, an inducer, considerably decreases them.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{consumers}} use natural health products (NHPs) concurrently with prescription medications. As NHP-related harms are under-reported through passive surveillance, {{the safety}} of <b>concurrent</b> NHP-drug <b>use</b> remains unknown. To conduct active surveillance in participating community pharmacies to identify adverse events related to <b>concurrent</b> NHP-prescription drug <b>use.</b> METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Participating pharmacists asked individuals collecting prescription medications about (i) <b>concurrent</b> NHP/drug <b>use</b> in the previous three months and (ii) experiences of adverse events. If an adverse event was identified and if the patient provided written consent, a research pharmacist conducted a guided telephone interview to gather additional information after obtaining additional verbal consent and documenting so within the interview form. Over a total of 112 pharmacy weeks, 2615 patients were screened, of which 1037 (39. 7 %; 95 % CI: 37. 8 % to 41. 5 %) reported concurrent NHP and prescription medication use. A total of 77 patients reported a possible AE (2. 94 %; 95 % CI: 2. 4 % to 3. 7 %), which represents 7. 4 % of those using NHPs and prescription medications concurrently (95 %CI: 6. 0 % to 9. 2 %). Of 15 patients available for an interview, 4 (26. 7 %: 95 % CI: 4. 3 % to 49. 0 %) reported an AE that {{was determined to be}} "probably" due to NHP use. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Active surveillance markedly improves identification and reporting of adverse events associated with <b>concurrent</b> NHP-drug <b>use.</b> Although not without challenges, active surveillance is feasible and can generate adverse event data of sufficient quality to allow for meaningful adjudication to assess potential harms...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{significant}} {{minority of}} Australians engage in <b>concurrent</b> drug <b>use</b> (using {{more than one}} drug in a given period). We examined clusters and correlates of <b>concurrent</b> drug <b>use</b> using the latest available nationally representative survey data on Australian young adults. Sample: 3836 participants aged 18 - 29. years (mean age 24. years) from the 2010 National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS). Method: Clusters were distilled using latent class analysis of past year use of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, ecstasy, ketamine, GHB, inhalants, steroids, barbiturates, meth/amphetamines, heroin, methadone/buprenorphine, other opiates, painkillers and tranquillisers/sleeping pills. Results: <b>Concurrent</b> drug <b>use</b> in this sample was best described using a 4 -class solution. The majority (87. 5 %) of young adults predominantly used alcohol only (50. 9 %) or alcohol and tobacco (36. 6 %). 10. 2 % reported using alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and ecstasy, and 2. 3 % reported using an extensive range of drugs. Conclusion: Most drug use clusters were robust in their profile and stable in their prevalence, indicating little meaningful change at the population level from 2007. The targeting of alcohol and tobacco use remains a priority, but openness to experiencing diverse drug-related effects remains a significant concern for 12. 5 % {{of young people in}} this age group...|$|R
25|$|Death from single-drug {{benzodiazepine}} overdoses occur infrequently, {{particularly after}} {{the point of}} hospital admission. However, combinations of high doses of benzodiazepines with alcohol, barbiturates, opioids or tricyclic antidepressants are particularly dangerous, and may lead to severe complications such as coma or death. In 2013, benzodiazepines were involved in 31% of the estimated 22,767 deaths from prescription drug overdose in the United States. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has subsequently issued a black box warning regarding <b>concurrent</b> <b>use</b> of benzodiazepines and opioids.

More recent studies have shown similar degrees of somnolence (approx. 2%) compared with placebo treatment. The problem of bitter taste may be reduced by correct application of the nasal spray (i.e. slightly tipping the head forward and not inhaling the medication too deeply), or alternatively using the azelastine/sucralose formulation.|$|E
