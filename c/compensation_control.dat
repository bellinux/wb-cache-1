Lack of knowledge about the development and design of MCS, and the need for systematic empirical research in this thematic area, are the main motivations for this research. This study seeks to explain the MCS within a Croatian context and it is one of few research studies conducted in the field of MCS in Croatia. In this research we used the concept of MCS that represents a combination of various cybernetic, administrative and cultural controls, as well as reward and <b>compensation</b> <b>controls,</b> with related techniques. This observation of MCS is wider and the strength of the typology lies in the broad scope of the controls in the MCS as a package, rather than the depth of its discussion as individual systems. The research adopted a survey methodology. Data were collected from 40 joint stock companies in Croatia using a post questionnaire. Final results suggest that joint stock companies in Croatia use more administrative and cybernetic controls than the reward and <b>compensation</b> <b>controls</b> and cultural controls as a part of MCS...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{examples}} of where feedback and feed-forward control {{can be used}} together are dead-time compensation, and inverse response compensation. Dead-time compensation is used to control devices that {{take a long time}} to show any change to a change in input, for example, change in composition of flow through a long pipe. A dead-time <b>compensation</b> <b>control</b> uses an element (also called a Smith predictor) to predict how changes made now by the controller will affect the controlled variable in the future. The controlled variable is also measured and used in feedback control. Inverse response compensation involves controlling systems where a change at first affects the measured variable one way but later affects it in the opposite way. An example would be eating candy. At first it will give you lots of energy, but later you will be very tired. As can be imagined, it is difficult to control this system with feedback alone, therefore a predictive feed-forward element is necessary to predict the reverse effect that a change will have in the future.'''''''' ...|$|E

If the sensitivity of pay to stock price or slope does not vary with stock price volatility, then total compensation has to increase with firm risk to satisfy as agent's individual rationality constraint. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find a correlation between total executive <b>compensation,</b> <b>controlling</b> for firm size, and risk measures such as firm beta, return volatility, and exposure to the ABX sub-prime index. There is no relationship between insider ownership, a proxy for slope, and these measures. Compensation and firm risk {{are not related to}} governance variables.

Electro-hydraulic load simulator is a typical case of the torque system which is strongly coupled with a hydraulic positioning system.

So rotor mass eccentricity vibration <b>compensation</b> <b>control</b> on rotating machine has great significance, especially for the high speed bearing less induction motor (BIM). A rotor mass eccentricity <b>compensation</b> <b>control</b> strategy was presented to restrain the vibration of suspended rotor for BIM. Firstly, the suspension rotor dynamical model was deduced and unbalanced vibration mechanism was analyzed. Secondly, based on decoupling control between electromagnetic torque and radial force, the obtained vibration signal from the displacement sensor was put into the original radial force control system. Then, a feedforward compensator {{was set up to}} increase the same period component of the given radial force signal and enlarge the stiffness of the vibration signal. Finally, the <b>compensation</b> <b>control</b> of rotor vibration was realized by forcing the rotor shaft rotation around its geometric center. The simulation results show that the presented feedforward compensator can suppress the vibration of rotor under different speed and improve the precision of rotor suspension. The further experimental results also show that the control method can obviously reduce the peak-peak value of rotor radial displacement and effectively restrain rotor vibration...|$|E
