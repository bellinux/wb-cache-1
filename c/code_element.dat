30|$|The {{previous}} research question {{does not consider}} the fact that code-anomaly agglomerations have higher probability of being related to architectural problems. The probability increase {{stems from the fact that}} each agglomeration involves more <b>code</b> <b>elements</b> than a single code anomaly. Then, it would be interesting to analyze to what extent various <b>code</b> <b>elements</b> of the agglomeration are, in fact, contributing to the realization of an architectural problem. In order to address this concern, we performed a further analysis about the relation between agglomerations and architectural problems. As a first step, for each system, we separated the anomalous <b>code</b> <b>elements</b> related to architectural problems in two sets: (1) anomalous <b>code</b> <b>elements</b> participating in one or more agglomerations; and (2) anomalous <b>code</b> <b>elements</b> not participating in any agglomeration. The union of the two groups forms the set of all anomalous <b>code</b> <b>elements</b> involved in architectural problems.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—To {{access the}} {{knowledge}} contained in developer communication such as forum posts, {{it is useful}} to automatically identify the <b>code</b> <b>elements</b> contained in documents. We propose a novel traceability recovery approach to extract the <b>code</b> <b>elements</b> contained in various documents. As opposed to previous work, our approach does not require an index of <b>code</b> <b>elements</b> to find links, which makes it particularly well-suited for the analysis of informal documentation. When evaluated on 188 StackOverflow posts containing 993 <b>code</b> <b>elements,</b> the technique performs with average 0. 92 precision and 0. 90 recall. As a major refinement on traditional traceability approaches, we also propose to detect which of the <b>code</b> <b>elements</b> in a document are salient, or germane, to the topic of the post. To this end we developed a three-feature decision tree classifier that performs with a precision of 0. 65 – 0. 74 and recall of 0. 30 – 0. 65, depending {{on the subject of the}} document. I...|$|R

50|$|Silent periods are {{the most}} {{important}} Morse <b>code</b> <b>element</b> for supporting full break-in or QSK operation. The Morse code silent periods of approximately: one dot duration between Morse code signals, three dot durations between symbols, and five dot durations between words or code groups and sentences provide operators with: mid-symbol, mid-word and mid-sentence, opportunities to interrupt or break-in on transmitting operators. These silent periods between signals, symbols and words also provide the sending operator with opportunities to listen for interruptions from receiving stations.|$|E
5000|$|In {{military}} {{communications and}} amateur radio the terms [...] "CW" [...] and [...] "Morse code" [...] {{are often used}} interchangeably, despite the distinctions between the two. Aside from radio signals, Morse code may be sent using direct current in wires, sound, or light, for example. For radio signals, a carrier wave is keyed on and off to represent the dots and dashes of the code elements. The carrier's amplitude and frequency remains constant during each <b>code</b> <b>element.</b> At the receiver, the received signal is mixed with a heterodyne signal from a BFO (beat frequency oscillator) to change the radio frequency impulses to sound. Though most commercial traffic has now ceased operation using Morse it is still popular with amateur radio operators. Non-directional beacons used in air navigation use Morse to transmit their identifier.|$|E
5000|$|Siberian Tatar {{language}} has different dialects. Since the penetration of Islam until the 1920s after the Russian Revolution, Siberian Tatars, like all Muslim nations, were using an alphabet {{that had been}} based on Arabic script. In 1928 they adopted an alphabet based on Latin script, and in 1939 one based on the Cyrillic script. Until 2014, the written language for Siberian Tatars was Tatar, a version based on the grammar rules of Volga Tatars. In the 21st century, work began on the rationalizing of the Siberian Tatar language. Teams have conducted scientific {{research in the field}} of literary language norms of the indigenous population of Siberia. They have published the [...] "Русско-сибирскотатарский словарь = Урысца-сыбырца сүслек" [...] (2010) (Russian-Siberian Tatar Dictionary), and [...] "Грамматика современного сибирскотатарского языка" [...] (2014)(The Grammar of Modern Siberian Tatar Language).

In both cases, none of the <b>code</b> <b>elements</b> takes part in the implementation of a different architectural component. In the second case, there is no syntactical relationship between the anomalous <b>code</b> <b>elements.</b> To understand what we consider a syntactic relationship, assume we have two classes, T and X, and two methods M and N. The classes T and X are syntactically related if X is referenced inside T or vice versa. The methods M and N are syntactically related if M calls N or vice versa. We do not consider the inheritance relationship, because it characterizes the occurrence of a hierarchical topology. Figure 2 shows an example of intra-boundary agglomeration. In this case, the method createHandler is infected by Divergent Change and the method parse is infected by Long Method. As both of them are enclosed by the same architectural component (webgrid) and there is an association between them, the createHandler and parse elements form an intra-boundary agglomeration.|$|R

30|$|Each {{agglomeration}} has {{a specific}} topology. Each agglomeration comprises {{one or more}} relationships that determine the grouping of code anomalies. There may be none, one or more agglomerations of each topology type in a program. Moreover, each agglomeration is composed {{by one or more}} code anomalies. In addition, each agglomeration uses one or more relationships to group code anomalies. Each code anomaly affects a specific <b>code</b> <b>element,</b> which may be affected by several code anomalies. A <b>code</b> <b>element</b> may realize multiple architectural problems. Conversely, an architectural problem is realized by one or multiple code elements. Finally, an agglomeration may help to diagnose an architectural problem by grouping anomalous code elements that collaborate to the realization of an architectural problem. We present below a detailed description of each topology accompanied by illustrative examples.|$|E
30|$|Aiming {{to analyze}} the {{different}} agglomeration topologies {{and how they are}} related to architectural problems, we defined the research questions described in Section 3.2. To answer our research questions, the criteria used for correlating code-anomaly agglomerations and single code anomalies with architectural problems were the following. A code-anomaly agglomeration and an architectural problem are related if they co-occur in, at least, one <b>code</b> <b>element.</b> Even though both agglomeration and architectural problem usually involve many elements, in our definition is sufficient that they co-occur in one element. Similarly, an individual code anomaly and an architectural problem are correlated if they occur in one <b>code</b> <b>element</b> together. We considered this decision appropriate because there were no previous evidence to base our study on. Therefore, in this first study we had {{to analyze the}} largest set of possible relations between agglomerations and architectural problems.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} proposes {{an amendment}} for the ISO/IEC TR 15285 “An operational model for characters and glyphs”. The amendment may have two annexes for the TR. One discusses about a “character repertoire design guidance for Syllabic Scripts ” and another discusses about a “recommended functionality for supporting sophisticated input assistance”. Both annexes are independent {{to each other}} but have strong interrelation between the two. Problem description: 1. Most of the syllabic scripts {{needs to have a}} rendering process of a string of multiple <b>coded</b> <b>elements</b> for presentation of them.
