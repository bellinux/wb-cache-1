5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy.

Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and <b>community</b> <b>work</b> that women have to do. Because of the lack of care workers available, the very young and the very old have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E
