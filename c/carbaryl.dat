5|$|N.californiensis has a {{negative}} impact on oyster production, and as a result, the insecticide <b>carbaryl</b> (1-napthyl N-methyl carbamate) is sprayed in some areas (including Willapa Bay, Washington) to reduce the population of N.californiensis. The addition of shelly debris also reduces numbers of N.californiensis both by preventing the settlement of larvae, and through predation on the young N.californiensis by young Dungeness crabs in the shelly debris.|$|E
25|$|The UCIL factory {{was built}} in 1969 to produce the {{pesticide}} Sevin (UCC's brand name for <b>carbaryl)</b> using methyl isocyanate (MIC) as an intermediate. A MIC production plant was added in 1979. After the Bhopal plant was built, other manufacturers, including Bayer, produced <b>carbaryl</b> without MIC, though at a greater manufacturing cost. Bayer also used the UCC process at the chemical plant once owned by UCC at Institute, West Virginia, in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{insecticides}} {{used for}} the treatment of head lice include organochlorines (lindane), organophosphates (malathion), carbamates (<b>carbaryl),</b> pyrethrins (pyrethrum), pyrethroids (permethrin, phenothrin, bioallethrin), and spinosad (spinosyn A and spinosyn D).|$|E

25|$|Methyl {{isocyanate}} is {{an intermediate}} chemical {{in the production}} of carbamate pesticides (such as <b>carbaryl,</b> carbofuran, methomyl, and aldicarb). It has also been used {{in the production of}} rubbers and adhesives. As a highly toxic and irritating material, it is hazardous to human health, and was involved in the Bhopal disasterâ€”which killed nearly 8,000 people initially and approximately 17,000 people in total. When inhaled the vapor produces a direct inflammatory effect on the respiratory tract.|$|E
25|$|Methyl {{isocyanate}} (MIC) is {{an organic}} compound with the molecular formula CH3NCO. Synonyms are isocyanatomethane, methyl carbylamine and MIC. Methyl isocyanate is an intermediate chemical {{in the production}} of carbamate pesticides (such as <b>carbaryl,</b> carbofuran, methomyl, and aldicarb). It has also been used {{in the production of}} rubbers and adhesives. As a highly toxic and irritating material, it is extremely hazardous to human health. It was the principal toxicant involved in the Bhopal disaster, which killed nearly 2,259 people initially and officially 3,787 people in total.|$|E
25|$|In late October 1984, tank E610 {{lost the}} ability to hold most of its {{nitrogen}} gas pressure. It meant that the liquid MIC contained within could not be pumped out. At the time of this failure, tank E610 contained 42 tons of liquid MIC. Shortly after this failure, MIC production was halted at the Bhopal facility, and parts of the plant were shut down for maintenance. Maintenance included the shutdown of the plant's flare tower so that a corroded pipe could be repaired. With the flare tower still out of service, production of <b>carbaryl</b> was resumed in late November, using MIC stored in the two tanks still in service. An attempt to re-establish pressure in tank E610 on 1 December failed, so the 42 tons of liquid MIC contained within still could not be pumped out of it.|$|E
500|$|There is {{evidence}} of chemical pollutants causing frog developmental deformities (extra limbs, or malformed eyes).|pmid=10620528|pmc=1637865|jstor=3454299}} [...] Pollutants have varying effects on frogs. [...] Some alter the central nervous system; others like atrazine cause a disruption in the production and secretion of hormones. Experimental studies have also shown that exposure to commonly used herbicides such as glyphosate (Tradename Roundup) or insecticides such as malathion or <b>carbaryl</b> greatly increase mortality of tadpoles. Additional {{studies have indicated that}} terrestrial adult stages of amphibians are also susceptible to non-active ingredients in Roundup, particularly POEA, which is a surfactant. [...] Atrazine has been shown to cause male tadpoles of African clawed frogs to become hermaphroditic with development of both male and female organs. Such feminization has been reported {{in many parts of the}} world. In a study conducted in a laboratory at Uppsala University in Sweden, more than 50% of frogs exposed to levels of estrogen-like pollutants existing in natural bodies of water in Europe and the United States became females. Tadpoles exposed even to the weakest concentration of estrogen were twice as likely to become females while almost all of the control group given the heaviest dose became female.|$|E
2500|$|Pesticides are {{released}} to the environment in large quantities so that most individuals have some degree of exposure. [...] The insecticides fenvalerate and <b>carbaryl</b> {{have been reported to}} increase spermatozoa aneuploidy. [...] Occupational exposure of pesticide factory workers to fenvalerate is associated with increased spermatozoa DNA damage. [...] Exposure to fenvalerate raised sex chromosome disomy 1.9-fold and disomy of chromosome 18 by 2.6-fold. [...] Exposure of male workers to <b>carbaryl</b> increased DNA fragmentation in spermatozoa, and also increased sex chromosome disomy by 1.7-fold and chromosome 18 disomy by 2.2-fold.|$|E
2500|$|Naphthalene is used {{mainly as}} a {{precursor}} to other chemicals. The single largest use of naphthalene is the industrial production of phthalic anhydride, although more phthalic anhydride is made from o-xylene. [...] Many azo dyes are produced from naphthalene, {{and so is the}} insecticide 1-naphthyl-N-methylcarbamate (<b>carbaryl).</b> Other useful agrichemicals include naphthoxyacetic acids.|$|E
2500|$|Exposure of {{spermatozoa}} to lifestyle, environmental and/or occupational hazards {{may increase}} the risk of aneuploidy. [...] Cigarette smoke is a known aneugen (aneuploidy inducing agent). [...] It is associated with increases in aneuploidy ranging from 1.5 to 3.0-fold. [...] Other studies indicate factors such as alcohol consumption, occupational exposure to benzene, and exposure to the insecticides fenvalerate and <b>carbaryl</b> also increase aneuploidy.|$|E
2500|$|Aggressively searching out, removing, and {{destroying}} the brood in infested trees {{is the best}} way to slow the spread of mountain pine beetles; however, it may not protect specific trees. Spraying trees to prevent attack is the most effective way to protect a small number of high-value trees from mountain pine beetles. <b>Carbaryl,</b> permethrin and bifenthrin are registered in the United States for use in the prevention of pine beetle infestations. <b>Carbaryl</b> is considered by the EPA to likely be carcinogenic to humans. [...] It is moderately toxic to wild birds and partially to highly toxic to aquatic organisms. Permethrin is easily metabolized in mammalian livers, so is less dangerous to humans. Birds are also practically not affected by permethrin. [...] Negative effects can be seen in aquatic ecosystems, as well as it being very toxic to beneficial insects. Bifenthrin is moderately dangerous to mammals, including humans; it is slightly more toxic to birds and aquatic ecosystems than permethrin, as well as extremely toxic to beneficial insects.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chemical}} process {{employed in the}} Bhopal plant had methylamine reacting with phosgene to form MIC, which was then reacted with 1-naphthol to form the final product, <b>carbaryl.</b> This [...] "route" [...] differed from the MIC-free routes used elsewhere, in which the same raw materials were combined in a different manufacturing order, with phosgene first reacting with naphthol to form a chloroformate ester, which was then reacted with methylamine. In the early 1980s, the demand for pesticides had fallen, but production continued, leading to build-up of stores of unused MIC.|$|E
2500|$|Research work {{undertaken}} {{to understand the}} benzene system opened a new field in organic chemistry leading to the modern understanding of aromatic systems as common throughout the chemical world. [...] Benzene itself is a useful solvent {{as well as a}} gasoline additive due to its high octane number and ability to reduce engine knocking, although methylbenzene is now being used as an alternative. [...] Benzene is also a precursor used in the manufacture of styrene, nylon, and epoxy resins. [...] Naphthalene is the active ingredient in traditional mothballs and is used to make the insecticide <b>carbaryl.</b> [...] Aromatic systems appear in many other important industrial products including Bakelite, polystyrene, and PET plastics.|$|E
