2500|$|If R is any {{ring and}} n a natural number, then the {{cartesian}} product R'n {{is both a}} left and a right module over R if we use the <b>component-wise</b> operations. Hence when , R is an R-module, where the scalar multiplication is just ring multiplication. The case [...] yields the trivial R-module {0} consisting only of its identity element.

2500|$|Intervals can be {{associated}} with points of the plane and hence regions of intervals can {{be associated}} with regions of the plane. Generally, an interval in mathematics corresponds to an ordered pair (x,y) taken from the direct product R × R of real numbers with itself. Often it is assumed that y > x. For purposes of mathematical structure, this restriction is discarded, and [...] "reversed intervals" [...] where y minus& x < 0 are allowed. Then the collection of all intervals [...] can be identified with the topological ring formed by the direct sum of R with itself where addition and multiplication are defined <b>component-wise.</b>|$|E

The Klein four-group is thus an example of an elementary abelian 2-group, which is also called a Boolean group. The Klein four-group is thus also the group generated by the symmetric difference as the binary operation on the subsets of a powerset of a set with two elements, i.e. over a field of sets with four elements, e.g. the empty set is the group's identity element in this case.|$|E

2500|$|Connections on {{a surface}} {{can be defined}} from various {{equivalent}} but equally important points of view. The Riemannian connection or Levi-Civita connection is perhaps most easily {{understood in terms of}} lifting vector fields, considered as first order differential operators acting on functions on the manifold, to differential operators on the tangent bundle or frame bundle. In the case of an embedded surface, the lift to an operator on vector fields, called the covariant derivative, is very simply described in terms of orthogonal projection. Indeed, a vector field on a surface embedded in [...] can be regarded as a function from the surface into [...] Another vector field acts as a differential operator <b>component-wise.</b> The resulting vector field will not be tangent to the surface, but this can be corrected taking its orthogonal projection onto the tangent space at each point of the surface.
