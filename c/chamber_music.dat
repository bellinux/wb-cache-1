5|$|In 1867, {{three years}} after the first performance, Rossini discreetly orchestrated the Petite messe solennelle, partly for fear that others would do it anyway after his death.

When his request was rejected, he demanded that the orchestral version would only be performed after his death. The composer preferred the <b>chamber</b> <b>music</b> version anyway.|$|E

5|$|Instrument {{builders}} developed {{other features}} that endure today. For example, while organs with multiple keyboards and pedals already existed, the first organs with solo stops {{emerged in the}} early fifteenth century.

Trumpets evolved into their modern form to improve portability, and players used mutes to properly blend into <b>chamber</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E
