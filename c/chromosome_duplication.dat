50|$|Once a {{polyploid}} is made, either synthetically or naturally, {{the genome}} {{goes through a}} period of “genome shock”. Genome shock can be defined as a stage in which the genome experiences massive reorganization and structural changes to deal with the external stress (X-ray damage, <b>chromosome</b> <b>duplication,</b> etc.) imposed upon the genome (3). Such changes are termed revolutionary changes and occur early in the process of diploidization (2). Revolutionary changes ensure that the organism has a stable genome that can be passed to its progeny.|$|E
40|$|In Caenorhabditis elegans {{triploid}} {{animals with}} two X chromosomes (symbolized 3 A; 2 X) are males. However, these triploid males can be feminized {{by making them}} mutant for recessive dosage compensation mutations, by adding X <b>chromosome</b> <b>duplications</b> or by microinjecting particular DNA sequences termed feminizing elements. None of these treatments affects diploid males. This study explores several aspects of these treatments in polyploids. The dosage compensation mutants exhibit a strong maternal effect, such that reduction {{of any of the}} dosage compensation gene functions in the mother leads to sex reversal of 3 A; 2 X animals. Likewise, all X <b>chromosome</b> <b>duplications</b> tested cause both sex reversal and intersexual development of many 3 A; 2 X animals. Microinjected feminizing element DNA does not cause extensive sex reversal, but does result in intersexual development in 3 A; 2 X animals. Neither X <b>chromosome</b> <b>duplications</b> nor microinjected feminizing elements show the extreme maternal effect of the dosage compensation mutants, although there is indirect evidence for a maternal effect of the feminizing elements. In particular, very little feminizing element DNA needs to be microinjected in order to feminize triploid males, far less than what is needed for stable inheritance, implying that feminizing elements can work within the mother's gonad. However, even very high concentrations of microinjected feminizing elements do not affect sex determination in diploid males, suggesting that they {{are not part of the}} numerator of the X/A ratio. In addition, no pair of X <b>chromosome</b> <b>duplications</b> feminizes diploid males, suggesting that none of these duplications contains a numerator of the X/A ratio.

50|$|The primary {{result of}} mitosis and {{cytokinesis}} is {{the transfer of}} a parent cell's genome into two daughter cells.

50|$|The {{creation}} of a new allopolyploid species (Mimulus peregrinus) was observed {{on the banks of the}} Shortcleuch Water—a river in Leadhills, South Lanarkshire, Scotland. Parented from the cross of the two species Mimulus guttatus (containing 14 pairs of chromosomes) and Mimulus luteus (containing 30-31 pairs from a <b>chromosome</b> <b>duplication),</b> M. peregrinus has six copies of its chromosomes (caused by the duplication of the sterile hybrid triploid). Due to the nature of these species, they have the ability to self-fertilize. Because of its number of chromosomes it is not able to pair with M. guttatus, M. luteus, or their sterile triploid offspring. M. peregrinus will either die, producing no offspring, or reproduce with itself effectively leading to a new species.|$|E
50|$|The cell {{membranes}} and cytoplasm of these haploid cells then fuse {{together in a}} process known as plasmogamy. This results in a single cell with two nuclei, known as pronuclei. The pronuclei then fuse together in a well regulated process known as karyogamy. This creates a diploid cell known as a zygote, or a zygospore, which can then enter meiosis, a process of <b>chromosome</b> <b>duplication,</b> recombination, and cell division, to create four new haploid gamete cells. The advantage of sexual reproduction is the same as in any organism: more genetic variability results, providing the opportunity for adaption through natural selection. Thus, karyogamy is the key step in bringing together a variety of genetic material in order to ensure recombination in meiosis.|$|E

50|$|Komodo dragons {{have the}} ZW {{chromosomal}} sex-determination system, {{as opposed to}} the mammalian XY system. Male progeny prove Flora's unfertilised eggs were haploid (n) and doubled their chromosomes later to become diploid (2n) (by being fertilised by a polar body, or by <b>chromosome</b> <b>duplication</b> without cell division), rather than by her laying diploid eggs by one of the meiosis reduction-divisions in her ovaries failing. When a female Komodo dragon (with ZW sex chromosomes) reproduces in this manner, she provides her progeny with only one chromosome from each of her pairs of chromosomes, including only one of her two sex chromosomes. This single set of chromosomes is duplicated in the egg, which develops parthenogenetically. Eggs receiving a Z chromosome become ZZ (male); those receiving a W chromosome become WW and fail to develop, meaning that only males are produced by parthenogenesis in this species.|$|E
50|$|Karyogamy is {{the final}} {{step in the process}} of fusing {{together}} two haploid eukaryotic cells, and refers specifically to the fusion of the two nuclei. Before karyogamy, each haploid cell has one complete copy of the organism's genome. In order for karyogamy to occur, the cell membrane and cytoplasm of each cell must fuse with the other in a process known as plasmogamy. Once within the joined cell membrane, the nuclei are referred to as pronuclei. Once the cell membranes, cytoplasm, and pronuclei fuse together, the resulting single cell is diploid, containing two copies of the genome. This diploid cell, called a zygote or zygospore can then enter meiosis (a process of <b>chromosome</b> <b>duplication,</b> recombination, and division, to produce four new haploid cells), or continue to divide by mitosis. Mammalian fertilization uses a comparable process to combine haploid sperm and egg cells (gametes) to create a diploid fertilized egg.|$|E
50|$|Reproductive {{isolation}} acts as {{the primary}} mechanism driving genetic divergence in allopatry and can be amplified by divergent selection. Pre-zygotic and post-zygotic isolation are often the most cited mechanisms for allopatric speciation, and as such, {{it is difficult to}} determine which form evolved first in an allopatric speciation event. Pre-zygotic simply implies the presence of a barrier prior to any act of fertilization (e.g. an environmental barrier dividing two populations) while post-zygotic implies the prevention of successful inter-population crossing after fertilization (e.g. the production of an infertile hybrid). Since species pairs who diverged in allopatry often exhibit pre- and post-zygotic isolation mechanisms, investigation of the earliest stages in the life cycle of the species can indicate whether or not divergence occurred due to a pre-zygotic or post-zygotic factor. However, establishing the specific mechanism may not be accurate, as a species pair continually diverges over time. For example, if a plant experiences a <b>chromosome</b> <b>duplication</b> event, reproduction will occur, but sterile hybrids will result—functioning as a form of post-zygotic isolation. Subsequently, the newly formed species pair may experience pre-zygotic barriers to reproduction as selection, acting on each species independently, will ultimately lead to genetic changes making hybrids impossible. From the researchers perspective, the current isolating mechanism may not reflect the past isolating mechanism.|$|E

The effects do {{not depend on the}} region of the X chromosome duplicated and is stronger in strains with two doses of a duplication than in strains with one dose.

40|$|Nontandem {{terminal}} <b>chromosome</b> <b>duplications</b> {{derived from}} N. crassa translocation T(I→VI) NM 103 give rise mitotically to some daughter nuclei {{which have become}} euploid by loss of {{one or the other}} of the two duplicated segments. Loss of the segment in normal sequence occurs as often as loss of the translocated segment. This is in contrast to all of several other Neurospora duplications that have been studied, where loss of the segment in normal sequence is absent or rare. ——T(NM 103) has the distal two thirds of linkage group IR exchanged with the right tip of VI. Crosses to normal sequence produce a class of morphologically distinct progeny with IR <b>chromosome</b> <b>duplications.</b> For a few days after germination, test crosses of these progeny are barren (make perithecia but few or no spores, as observed commonly with Neurospora duplications). Growing duplication cultures become fertile by accumulating nuclei which have been reduced to either normal sequence (by loss of the segment in translocation sequence) or translocation sequence (by loss of the segment in normal sequence). Both types usually appear within the first week of growth. Naturally formed mixtures or heterokaryons of NM 103 duplication nuclei and their reduced euploid products have been studied by plating and by progeny testing. Determination of nuclear type is based on culture morphology, expression of genetic markers, and crossing behavior. Within the limits of testing, loss is found to begin precisely at the interchange points. The unique finding of frequent breakdown of normal-sequence linkage group I chromosomes is not dependent on the strain from which the chromosome was derived. Many different strains were tested, and for each one evidence was found that nuclei reduced to translocation sequence had been produced from duplication nuclei by loss of the segment in normal sequence...|$|R

This study aimed to evaluate the induction ability of the inducer line KEMS in a tropical climate and test the efficiency of the R 1 -Navajo marker by flow cytometry to evaluate two <b>chromosome</b> <b>duplication</b> protocols and analyze the development of the doubled haploids in the field. To accomplish this goal, four genotypes (F 1 and F 2 generations) were crossed with the haploid inducer line KEMS.

The percentages of self-fertilized plants after duplication as well as the quantities of doubled haploid seeds obtained after the self-fertilization processes were analyzed. It was observed that the germplasm influences haploid induction but not the duplication rates of the tested protocols. Protocol 2 was more efficient for the duplication of haploids, in the percentage of self-fertilized plants after duplication, and in the attainment of doubled haploid lines. Moreover, the haploid inducer line KEMS can produce haploids in a tropical climate. Other markers, in addition to the R 1 -Navajo system, should be used in the selection of haploid seeds...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Minichromosome {{maintenance}} (MCM) proteins {{are essential}} eukaryotic DNA replication factors. The binding of MCMs to chromatin oscillates {{in conjunction with}} progress through the mitotic cell cycle. This oscillation is thought {{to play an important}} role in coupling DNA replication to mitosis and limiting <b>chromosome</b> <b>duplication</b> to once per cell cycle. The coupling of DNA replication to mitosis is absent in Drosophila endoreplication cycles (endocycles), during which discrete rounds of <b>chromosome</b> <b>duplication</b> occur without intervening mitoses. We examined the behavior of MCM proteins in endoreplicating larval salivary glands, to determine whether oscillation of MCM–chromosome localization occurs in conjunction with passage through an endocycle S phase. We found that MCMs in polytene nuclei exist in two states: associated with or dissociated from chromosomes. We demonstrate that cyclin E can drive chromosome association of DmMCM 2 and that DNA synthesis erases this association. We conclude that mitosis is not required for oscillations in chromosome binding of MCMs and propose that cycles of MCM–chromosome association normally occur in endocycles. These results are discussed in a model in which the cycle of MCM–chromosome associations is uncoupled from mitosis because of the distinctive program of cyclin expression in endocycles. Polyploidy is observed during the normal development of many organisms (Wilson, 1987). A welldocumented means for attaining polyploidy in both plants and animals is endoreplication, in which successive rounds of <b>chromosome</b> <b>duplication</b> occur in the absence of cell division.
