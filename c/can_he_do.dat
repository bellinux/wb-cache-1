Ganesh Kumar edited {{the film and}} Mohanam was the art director. Filmmaker Bapu designed the logo of the production company and the film's title. The role written for Narayana was a last minute addition by Balachander; he took inspiration from similar characters in English plays and ballads he had read. Rudraveena principal photography took place at Chennai, Kanchipuram, Courtallam, and Srinagar for 70 days. Balachander later remarked, [...] "Chiranjeevi has both Kamal Haasan and Rajnikanth in him. Not only <b>can</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> action, he can also act".|$|E

2500|$|At the time, an {{official}} scorned Lü Meng {{because of his}} young age and often insulted him by saying, [...] "What <b>can</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> His behaviour would only result in him feeding himself to the tigers." [...] Lü Meng frequently encountered the official and killed him one day when he could not contain his anger. He took shelter under Zheng Chang (鄭長) initially, but later turned himself in to Yuan Xiong (袁雄), a Colonel (校尉) under Sun Ce. Yuan Xiong pleaded with his lord to spare Lü Meng's life. Sun Ce interviewed Lü Meng and {{was so impressed with}} him that he pardoned Lü Meng and recruited him as a close aide.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the 1978 season, Oakland owner Finley again {{sought to}} discard Coleman, {{asking him to}} report to the Athletics' minor league club in Vancouver. [...] Coleman refused and {{compiled}} a 3–0 record and a 0.00 ERA in his first eight appearances of the 1978 season. [...] Coleman had a 1.37 ERA when he was sold by Oakland to the Toronto Blue Jays for the waiver price of $10,000. [...] Finley reportedly [...] "blew his top" [...] after Coleman gave up a home run to Chicago's Lamar Johnson. Bobby Winkles resigned as Oakland's manager after Finley's impulsive decision to sell the club's most effective relief pitcher. [...] Days later, Finley offered to buy Coleman back from Toronto for double the price Toronto had paid. Blue Jays' president, Peter Bavasi, declined Finley's proposal, suspecting that Finley had found another team prepared to pay more for Coleman. [...] Coleman noted {{at the time that he}} was happy to escape Finley. [...] After his bid to reacquire Coleman was rejected, Finley claimed he had only wanted to reacquire Coleman to trade him to Pittsburgh and lashed out at Coleman: [...] "He's a very fine old man, but all he does is throw that slop up there. Maybe he can do all right. He doesn't throw hard enough now to break a pane of glass. He was spending his spare time trying to teach our young guys to pitch. [...] How <b>can</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> that when he can't pitch himself?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes <b>he</b> <b>can.</b> <b>He</b> <b>does.</b> That is an invasion. And {{whether he}} is there or not, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> and will write about my house. And though {{no one else will}} make himself such a fool as <b>he</b> has <b>done</b> by his letter, {{nevertheless}} even that is a sign of what others are doing.

5000|$|The {{central theme}} of the book seems to be [...] "power corrupts, and {{absolute}} power corrupts absolutely", {{but this is not}} necessarily the case. Justinian is a man who believes <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> no wrong. After all, he's on the throne because God wants him to be there.
