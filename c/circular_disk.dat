To maintain this amount of dust in orbit around Vega, a continual source of replenishment would be required. A proposed mechanism for maintaining the dust was a disk of coalesced bodies that {{were in the process of}} collapsing to form a planet. Models fitted to the dust distribution around Vega indicate that it is a 120AU-radius <b>circular</b> <b>disk</b> viewed from nearly pole-on. In addition, there is a hole in the center of the disk with a radius of no less than 80AU.|$|E
25|$|The medieval Indian texts {{called the}} Puranas {{describe}} {{the earth as}} a flat-bottomed, <b>circular</b> <b>disk</b> with concentric oceans and continents. This general scheme is present {{not only in the}} Hindu cosmologies but also in Buddhist and Jain cosmologies of South Asia. However, some Puranas include other models.

25|$|Another {{closely related}} {{manifold}} {{is the real}} projective plane. If a <b>circular</b> <b>disk</b> is {{cut out of the}} real projective plane, what is left is a Möbius strip. Going in the other direction, if one glues a disk to a Möbius strip by identifying their boundaries, the result is the projective plane. To visualize this, it is helpful to deform the Möbius strip so that its boundary is an ordinary circle (see above). The real projective plane, like the Klein bottle, cannot be embedded in three-dimensions without self-intersections.|$|E

40|$|We propose two {{new novel}} {{techniques}} for detecting gravitational waves. First technique {{is based on}} detecting variation in angular speed {{of the system of}} two <b>circular</b> <b>disks</b> connected by a light rod, kept perpendicularly to incoming gravitational wave, in the y-z plane say. This dumbbell-like system is kept in y-z plane in free rotational motion with constant speed, and further in vacuum to avoid any dissipation, and with as much high speed as possible, such that it will be revolving around the axis of rotation parallel to say x axis that passes through the center of mass of this assembly of two disks connected by light rod. The idea to achieve variation in angular speed is based on the principle of conservation of angular momentum. The synchronization is arranged so that there will be elongation when the centers of <b>circular</b> <b>disks</b> are along the line parallel to y axis as well as when the centers of <b>circular</b> <b>disks</b> are along line parallel to z axis.
