5|$|SIM's new {{technology}} {{was meant to}} lead to the development of telescopes powerful enough to take images of Earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting distant stars and to determine whether those planets are able to sustain life. NASA has already started developing future missions that will build on SIM's technological legacy. The technological development phase of the mission was completed in November 2006 with the announcement that the eight, mission-technology-milestones set by NASA were reached. The milestones were necessary steps in the technological development before flight <b>control</b> <b>instruments</b> could begin to be designed. The completion of each milestone meant that new systems had to be developed for nanometer control as well as picometer knowledge technology; these systems enable the telescope to make its accurate measurements with extreme accuracy.|$|E
5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The <b>control</b> <b>instruments</b> were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E
25|$|The {{responsibility}} for the procurement and maintenance of all ordnance equipment is vested in the Ordnance Corps and encompasses a spectrum of equipment ranging from anti-aircraft missiles and naval armament to the uniforms worn by military personnel. The corps is also responsible for the procurement of food and provision of commercial catering services. These tasks are of a technical nature and the corps personnel are appropriately qualified and with the expertise to afford technical evaluation of complete weapon systems, it also includes embracing weapons, ammunition, fire <b>control</b> <b>instruments</b> and night vision equipment. The Ordnance Corps provides improvised explosive device disposal within the state, {{in support of the}} Garda Síochána. Courses are conducted for its own personnel and for students from the military and police of other nations. Ordnance Corps personnel continue to serve in overseas missions and are an essential component of missions involving troops.|$|E

500|$|Marat was {{partially}} reconstructed between {{the fall of}} 1928 and 8 April 1931 at the Baltic Works. The most obvious external change was a much more elaborate forward superstructure needed to house new fire <b>control</b> <b>instruments.</b> A KDP-6 fire-control director, with two [...] Zeiss rangefinders, was positioned {{at the top of}} the tubular foremast. An [...] Zeiss rangefinder was also added on the rear superstructure. The top of the forward funnel was lengthened by about [...] and angled backwards in an attempt to keep the exhaust gases away from the control and gunnery spaces. A derrick was added to the mainmast to handle a KR-1 flying boat imported from Germany that was stored above the third turret. No aircraft catapult was fitted so the aircraft had to take off and land on the water. A forecastle was added to the bow, which was also given much more sheer and flare to improve her sea-keeping abilities. Her turrets were overhauled, her guns replaced and new 8-meter rangefinders were installed on every turret. Her boilers were converted to only burn fuel oil and the more powerful boilers allowed the forward three boilers to be removed. The space freed up was used for anti-aircraft ammunition and various control spaces. The cruising turbines were also removed which simplified the ship's machinery at a small cost in power. These changes increased her displacement to [...] at full load and her overall length to [...] Her metacentric height increased to [...] from her designed [...] mainly because she now carried much of her fuel in her double bottom rather than in coal bunkers high on the sides of the ship. More weight was added to her before World War II, including an increase in the thickness of her turret roofs to , that decreased her metacentric height to only [...] This was unsatisfactory and plans were made to reconstruct her again, but they were cancelled when the Germans attacked in 1941.|$|E
