40|$|Court delays are a {{frequent}} concern, yet what explains <b>court</b> <b>case</b> duration remains incompletely understood. We study {{the time to}} <b>court</b> <b>case</b> resolution by drawing on a detailed case-level dataset of civil suits filed at a major Belgian court. We utilize the competing risks regression framework to address the typically neglected heterogeneity in the modes of <b>court</b> <b>case</b> resolution and examine {{the role of a}} wide range of both time-invariant and time-varying covariates. Controlling for judge fixed effects, we find substantial disparities in the effect of party and case characteristics on the time to settlement versus trial judgment. Exploiting the de facto random assignment of cases to serving judges within the court's chambers, we further find that judge characteristics matter for time to trial judgment, but not for time to settlement. Modeling heterogeneity in the modes of <b>court</b> <b>case</b> resolution is therefore central to understanding of <b>court</b> <b>case</b> durations...|$|R

In a 1935 case, the Court struck all the New <b>Court</b> <b>cases</b> from Kentucky common law.|$|E

5|$|A major {{aspect of}} civil liberties {{progress}} after World War II was the undoing centuries of racism in federal, state, and local governments an effort generally associated with the Civil Rights Movement. Several civil liberties organizations worked together for progress, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the ACLU, and the American Jewish Congress. The NAACP took primary responsibility for Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>cases</b> (often led by lead NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall), with the ACLU focusing on police misconduct, and supporting the NAACP with amicus briefs. The NAACP achieved a key victory in 1950 with the Henderson v. United States decision that ended segregation in interstate bus and rail transportation.|$|E
5|$|After relegation from Scotland's top flight, East Stirlingshire was {{controversially}} {{merged with}} Clydebank Juniors in 1964. The new club was renamed East Stirlingshire Clydebank– often E.S. Clydebank for short– and relocated to Kilbowie Park in Clydebank against fans' wishes. However, the merge lasted only one season, with East Stirlingshire shareholders winning several <b>court</b> <b>cases</b> {{against it and}} thus the club reverted to its original legal status and moved back to Falkirk. During the single season as E.S. Clydebank, the club set a record attendance at Kilbowie Park when 14,900 spectators attended a Scottish Cup first round replay against Hibernian in February 1965.|$|E

When the insurers refused to pay, the resulting <b>court</b> <b>cases</b> (Gregson v Gilbert (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232) held that in some circumstances, the deliberate killing of slaves was legal and that insurers could be required to pay for the slaves' deaths. The judge, Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, ruled against the syndicate owners in this case, due to new evidence being introduced suggesting the captain and crew were at fault.|$|E
5|$|As {{illustrated}} by the table of matches above, little is known of organised cricket to 1725 {{because of the lack}} of newspaper coverage. The shortage of references in the latter part of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as <b>court</b> <b>cases,</b> or in private letters and diaries. It follows that equally little is known of clubs and teams, players and locations.|$|E
