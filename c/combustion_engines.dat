5|$|Common uses {{of oxygen}} include {{residential}} heating, internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engines,</b> production of steel, plastics and textiles, brazing, welding and cutting of steels and other metals, rocket propellant, oxygen therapy, and {{life support systems}} in aircraft, submarines, spaceflight and diving.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} sizable {{temperature}} and density ranges, plasmas find applications in many fields of research, technology and industry. For example, in: industrial and extractive metallurgy, surface treatments such as plasma spraying (coating), etching in microelectronics, metal cutting and welding; {{as well as}} in everyday vehicle exhaust cleanup and fluorescent/luminescent lamps, while even playing a part in supersonic <b>combustion</b> <b>engines</b> for aerospace engineering.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydrogen}} internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> vehicle (HICEV) {{is a type}} {{of hydrogen}} vehicle using an internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine.</b> Hydrogen internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> vehicles are different from hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (which use electrochemical conversion of hydrogen rather than combustion); the hydrogen internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> is simply {{a modified version of the}} traditional gasoline-powered internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
50|$|The RD-0203/4 was {{the second}} staged <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> in the world, only after the S1.5400, and {{was also the first}} staged <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> with {{storable}} propellants.|$|R
40|$|The method {{involves}} performing {{load control}} {{of an internal}} <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> by a throttle valve provided in a suction line. An exhaust line is provided at a crankcase and is connected with the suction line. An electronically controllable valve (115) is arranged in the exhaust line to control the exhaust flow of the internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> depending on the operating condition of the internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine.</b> An independent claim is also included for an internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> for the execution of a crankcase ventilating method...|$|R
5|$|A {{separate}} 2008 {{study from}} Western Michigan University found that hybrids and conventional vehicles are equally safe when travelling {{more than about}} , because tire and wind noise generate most of the audible cues at those speeds. Hybrid cars were also tested safe when leaving a stoplight and {{it was found that}} under this condition they do not pose a risk to pedestrians. All Prius models used in the study engaged their internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engines</b> when accelerating from a standstill and produced enough noise to be detected.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{cars and}} plug-in hybrids when {{operating}} in all-electric mode at low speeds produce less roadway noise {{as compared to}} vehicles propelled by an internal combustion engine, thereby reducing harmful noise health effects. However, blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of <b>combustion</b> <b>engines</b> a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in electric cars and conventional hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard when operating at low speeds.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Marmaduke was academically {{gifted and}} also a keen boxer and long-distance swimmer. He also took a keen {{interest}} in mechanical things, particularly <b>combustion</b> <b>engines,</b> and was building Meccano models of aircraft and other vehicles by the age of 12. In his early teens, he became an avid amateur mechanic, fixing the family motor car and learning to drive. Marmaduke was never a hard worker and did not embark upon an academic career, but was considered to possess above average intelligence. In 1929, he passed the Junior Certificate Exam with first class honours. The certificate qualified him for Victoria Boy's High School from which he graduated in 1931.|$|E
5000|$|In hybrid {{electric}} boats, it boat has {{an internal}} <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> anyway, then its alternator will provide significant charge {{when it is}} running. Two schemes are in use: the <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> and the electric motor are both coupled to the drive (parallel hybrid), or the <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> drives a separate generator only, for charging the storage batteries (series hybrid).|$|R
50|$|Other devices {{which use}} linear alternators to {{generate}} electricity include the free-piston linear generator, an internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine,</b> and the free-piston Stirling <b>engine,</b> an external <b>combustion</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The M4+2 engine , {{also known}} as the double piston {{internal}} <b>combustion</b> <b>engine,</b> is a new type of internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> invented by a Polish patent holder Piotr Mężyk.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of <b>combustion</b> <b>engines</b> a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E
5|$|BP in its 2017 Energy Outlook {{forecasts}} {{that the}} number of plug-in electric cars will rise from 1.2 million in 2015 to around 100 million by 2035 representing about 5.5% of the global fleet of passenger cars. Around 25% of these plug-in electric vehicles will be plug-in hybrids and 75% will be pure battery electric cars. The oil company also projects that automotive fuel demand for use in cars will continue to rise, despite efficiency improvements in conventional internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engines</b> and increased plug-in car adoption due to growth in demand for car travel from the growing middle class in emerging economies.|$|E
5|$|Boats {{of nearly}} any variety are {{permitted}} on Lake Erie at Presque Isle State Park. Boats with internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engines</b> are prohibited {{in the interior}} lagoons, except for Grave Yard Pond, where a concession rents motor and pontoon boats, canoes, and kayaks for recreational use. The park also has a 500-slip marina, open to boats up to , and five boat launches. Boat tours provide views of the park, lake, bay, and Erie skyline. All boats must have a current registration from any state. Water conditions on Lake Erie can change with little notice, and boaters are asked to use caution.|$|E
50|$|In a {{power-split}} hybrid {{electric drive}} train {{there are two}} motors: a traction electric motor and an internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine.</b> The power from these two motors can be shared to drive the wheels via a power split device, which is a simple planetary gear set. The ratio can be from 100% for the <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> to 100% for the traction electric motor, or anything in between, such as 40% for the electric motor and 60% for the <b>combustion</b> <b>engine.</b> The <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> {{can act as a}} generator charging the batteries.|$|R
50|$|Operating independently, in 1807 the Swiss {{engineer}} François Isaac de Rivaz {{built the}} De Rivaz engine, a hydrogen-powered internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine.</b> These practical engineering projects may {{have followed the}} 1680 theoretical design of an internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> by the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens. The separate, virtually contemporaneous implementations of this design in different modes of transport means that the de Rivaz engine may be correctly described as the first use of an internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> in an automobile (1808), whilst the Pyréolophore was the first use of an internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> in a boat (1807).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{analysis}} of structure {{and performance of}} internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> is {{presented in this paper}} from the following two aspects: the thermal load of I. C. Engine and the thermal efficiency of diesel engines. Firstly, the thermal load of key parts of I. C. Engine as well as the evaluation parameters of which are introduced briefly. Furthermore, based on the factors influencing the heat transfer process of internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine,</b> the current research situation of internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> work process and heat balance for combustion chamber components, and the whole engine using numerical simulation method is described, while the coupled study of internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> components is developing trends of internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> heat balance study in the future...|$|R
5|$|Internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engines</b> are {{relatively}} inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion {{as most of}} the energy is wasted as heat, and the rest while the engine is idling. Electric motors, on the other hand, are more efficient at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric drive vehicles do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking through regenerative braking. Typically, conventional gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and diesel engines can reach on-board efficiencies of 20%, while electric drive vehicles typically have on-board efficiencies of around 80%.|$|E
5|$|The {{pulling power}} of the Trait du Nord made it popular for use during the Industrial Revolution of the late 19th century in heavy industry, {{including}} mining. In mines, steam engines and internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engines</b> {{could not be used}} due to the possibility of a gas explosion. The first horses were used in the mines in 1821 and the Trait du Nord quickly became a favorite for hauling carts in the mines and operating the pulleys used to lift coal to the surface. Breeders worked to adapt the breed to mining requirements, and the breed became larger as more power was needed to pull heavier loads. Good horses were able to pull , usually around twelve cars worth, along a railway. As early as 1920, the usage of horses in mines began to decline as electric locomotives came into use, and in 1969 the last horse was removed from the mines.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{ambulances}} {{are typically}} powered by internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engines,</b> {{which can be}} powered by any conventional fuel, including diesel, gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas, depending on the preference of the operator {{and the availability of}} different options. Colder regions often use gasoline-powered engines, as diesels can be difficult to start when they are cold. Warmer regions may favor diesel engines, as they are thought to be more efficient and more durable. Diesel power is sometimes chosen due to safety concerns, after a series of fires involving gasoline-powered ambulances during the 1980s. These fires were ultimately attributed in part to gasoline's higher volatility in comparison to diesel fuel. The type of engine may be determined by the manufacturer: in the past two decades, Ford would only sell vehicles for ambulance conversion if they are diesel-powered. Beginning in 2010, Ford will sell its ambulance chassis with a gasoline engine in order to meet emissions requirements.|$|E
5000|$|An {{internal}} <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> is a {{heat engine}} that obtains mechanical energy from chemical energy by burning fuel. From this mechanical energy, the internal <b>combustion</b> <b>engine</b> often generates electricity.|$|R
