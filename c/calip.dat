40|$|Social {{services}} include practices {{aiming at}} {{the prosperity of}} {{all the members of}} society, especially disadvantaged groups. This term also includes military social services that cover all kinds of support for soldiers and their families. Rashid Caliphs’ period is the period that social service practices that the Prophet had initiated were sustained and developed. During this period that severe and prolonged wars appeared, significant social service activities were carried out for soldiers’ families. In this study, The content of “Social Service” were filled with the applications of the first century of Islam, {{in the case of the}} aid to the soldiers' families during the period of Rashid <b>calips.</b> There is no doubt that there are many social activities in the West, from the 7 th century to the 19 th century. However, in Muslim societies for almost ten centuries, much stronger social service practices have been realized compared to Western societies. Nevertheless, nowadays in academic studies in the field of social services is very little mention of Islamic Civilization. This general approach to the social service community is an important influence on the emergence of our work...|$|R
40|$|Geocartographical {{representations}} of Islamic countries One {{important factor in}} the rapid spread of Islam was its geographical raising at the hub of a series of numerous trade routes, including caravan trails leading from the Middle East through Central Asia to North China, and across the Sahara to the Sudan, South Africa, Malaysia, Indonesia and America. This book looks at the relationships between geocartographical representations and Muslim religion. Even prior to Islamic presence, the city of Mecca served as a centre of trade in Arabia and Muhammad was a merchant. Islamic civilisation grew and expanded {{on the basis of this}} economy, in contrast of the Christian, Indian and Chinese ones. During the Islamic Golden Age (c. 750 CE – 1. 258 CE) the Islamic cartography was patronized by the Abbassid <b>Calips</b> of Bagdad. During this period important studies of astronomy and medieval have been developed. Various Islamic scholars and voyagers contributed to its development and the most notable includes al-Idrisi, born in Ceuta, that lived in Sicily at the court of King Roger II. Later development took place under Turks, particularly with notable scholars as the cartographer Piri Reis. In recent years Islam has once again started to spread into Europe, caused by immigration of the dispossessed Muslim from North Africa (Egypt, Algeria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia), the East (Albania), Middle East (Turkey, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq) and Southern Asia (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia). This book is the culmination of a collective effort: Sergio Moscone writes on the Christians in the Muslim countries and Valentina Verda on the quality school in Senegal...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{utility of the}} {{computer}} as a creative and self-expressive medium, it is rarely accessible for such purposes in the classroom. The professional literature is replete with evidence that computer utilization among {{students with learning disabilities}} has been primarily a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) approach. This narrow view of learners as receptors suggests, among other things, that because of their exceptionalities, students with learning disabilities possess relatively fewer strengths than their non-learning-disabled peers and less aptitude for such com-plex and creative tasks as programming. The {{purpose of the present study}} was twofold: (a) to investigate differences in computer aptitude among 56 junior high school students with learning disabilities and 56 non-learning-disabled peers, and (b) to consider gender differences in computer aptitude among the entire sample population. Subjects in each group were administered the Computer Aptitude, Literacy, and Interest Profile (<b>CALIP)</b> (Poplin, Drew, & Gable, 1984), and their composite scores were compared.
