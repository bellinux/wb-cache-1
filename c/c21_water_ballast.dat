5000|$|<b>Water</b> <b>Ballast</b> - Centrally located {{under the}} cockpit sole, a <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> chamber holds {{approximately}} 170Lbs (77 kg) of ballast down low {{where it is}} most beneficial. This ballast can be emptied to facilitate easier rowing or trailering ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Water</b> <b>ballast</b> {{tanks were}} fitted to {{each end of}} the vessel which enabled her to be trimmed to any desired draught. There were also large <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> tanks in the holds in order for {{trimming}} the vessel in rough weather.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{competition}} gliders carry jettisonable <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> (in {{the wings}} and sometimes in the vertical stabilizer). The extra weight provided by the <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> is advantageous if the lift {{is likely to be}} strong, and may also be used to adjust the glider's center of mass. Moving the center of mass toward the rear by carrying water in the vertical stabilizer reduces the required down-force from the horizontal stabilizer and the resultant drag from that down-force. Although heavier gliders have a slight disadvantage when climbing in rising air, they achieve a higher speed at any given glide angle. This is an advantage in strong conditions when the gliders spend only a small amount of time climbing in thermals. The pilot can jettison the <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> before it becomes a disadvantage in weaker thermal conditions. Another use of <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> is to dampen air turbulence such as might be encountered during ridge soaring. To avoid undue stress on the airframe, gliders must jettison any <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> before landing.|$|R
50|$|In view {{of these}} safety and cost-related arguments, the Standard Class rules were updated to allow {{disposable}} <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> and retractable undercarriages. Retractable wheels were allowed by 1970 and <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> by 1972. Manufacturers were fitting these as production items, {{and they had}} to be disabled to fly in competitions.|$|R

40|$|The human-mediated {{transfer}} of harmful organisms via shipping, especially via <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> transport, has raised considerable attention {{especially in the}} last decade due to the negative associated impacts. <b>Ballast</b> <b>water</b> sampling is important to assess the compliance with <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> management requirements (i. e. compliance monitoring). The complexity of <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> sampling is a result of organism diversity and behaviour which may require different sampling strategies, as well as ship design implications including availability of <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> sampling points. This paper discusses the <b>ballast</b> <b>water</b> sampling methodologies with emphasis on compliance monitoring by the Port State Control officers according to the International Convention on the Management of Ships’ <b>Ballast</b> <b>Water</b> and Sediments, 2004.

25|$|With a {{handicap}} factor of 100, {{according to the}} 2008 handicap list of the Deutscher Aero Club e.V., the SZD-59 in 15m-configuration is a typical Club Class glider. With 15m wing-tips with or without winglets glide performance can be enhanced by increasing its wing loading with up to 150 litres of <b>water</b> <b>ballast,</b> but <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> is not allowed in the 13.2m configuration.|$|R

50|$|While the M-26-M {{remained}} a <b>water</b> <b>ballasted</b> design, it also incorporates 300 pounds of fixed ballast which improves stability when the <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> tanks are empty. At 2550 pounds empty (1160 kg), {{it can be}} towed by most light trucks, SUVs, and minivans equipped with towing packages. The MSRP for the base model M-26-M, with aluminum trailer (new for 2007, replacing the previous steel trailers), was US$22,500.|$|R
50|$|A {{common type}} of ballast for small boats that avoids many of the {{problems}} of high-density <b>ballast</b> is <b>water</b> <b>ballast.</b> While it seems counter-intuitive that placing water in the hull (which is, after all, close to the same density as the water outside the hull- fresh vs salt water) would add any stability, adding <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> below the vertical center of gravity increases stability. The <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> {{does not need to be}} lifted above the waterline to affect stability, as any material having greater bulk density than air will have an effect on the centre of gravity. It is the relationship between centre of gravity and centre of buoyancy that dictates the righting moment.|$|R

50|$|As all Standard Class sailplanes, the ASW-28 {{does not}} have flaps or other lift-enhancing devices. It has tall winglets, a {{retractable}} undercarriage and a <b>water</b> <b>ballast</b> system. The structure is a complex composite of carbon, aramid and polyethylene fibre reinforced plastic. This permits a light structure with the strength to carry large amounts of <b>water</b> <b>ballast,</b> thus permitting the widest possible range of wing loadings for weak and strong soaring weather.|$|R
