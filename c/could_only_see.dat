5|$|October 9, 1944, {{was another}} {{in a string of}} days {{consisting}} of accused men testifying on the witness stand. This day, however, Thurgood Marshall, chief counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), sat in on the proceedings. Marshall had flown to the Bay Area on a special wartime travel priority arranged by Navy Secretary Forrestal. The NAACP had given the mutiny trial top importance due to the U.S. Navy's policy of putting Negroes into dirty and dangerous jobs with no hope of advancement. Although Marshall was allowed to observe the trial, as a civilian he was ineligible to take an official role in the men's defense. After hearing five of the men defend themselves, Marshall spoke to the 50 men and then conferred with Veltmann's defense team. The next day, Marshall held a press conference, charging that Judge Advocate Coakley was handling the case in a prejudicial manner. Marshall said that, from a review of the proceedings and his conversations with the accused, he <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>see</b> these men being tried for lesser charges of individual insubordination, not mass mutiny.|$|E
25|$|Early {{infrared}} homing missiles had two {{limitations that}} made them difficult to use in combat situations. The first was that the seeker was relatively insensitive and required large, hot sources to reliably track a target. In practice, this meant the engine of the enemy aircraft had to remain visible to the missile though the shot. The other was that the seeker had a limited field of view (FOV), meaning it <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>see</b> the target if it {{was in front of}} the missile. This meant it was possible for the target to escape by flying at right angles to the missile, maximizing its angular velocity relative to the seeker.|$|E
25|$|He was a {{tall and}} bulky person with a {{prominent}} stomach and invariably played with a clean shaven head without any hat or cap {{or any kind of}} head gear. He always wore very loose pants and after batting for a while or keeping wicket for sometime his shirt will be hanging out of the trousers and somebody must tuck it in, now and then. He had a rather ugly and uncouth stance at the wicket as he held his bat very low and bent his body forward so much that his head was practically in line with the top of the wickets. Those who watched him from the on side <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>see</b> his prominent hind portion of the body sticking up while the head, bat and the rest of Dilawar Hussain were hardly visible. However, he had a very sound defense and so {{it was very difficult to}} get him out. He was the most selfish batsman that I have ever seen.|$|E

25|$|The {{programme}} was {{a success}} and a full series followed, continuing, with breaks, until 1974, when the Christmas special became the final episode. Although the popularity of Steptoe and Son made Corbett a star, it ended his serious acting as he became irreversibly associated with Harold Steptoe in the public eye. Before the series began, Corbett had played Shakespeare's Richard II to great acclaim; however, when he played Hamlet in 1970, he felt both critics and audiences alike were not taking him seriously and <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>see</b> him as Harold Steptoe. Corbett found himself receiving offers only for bawdy comedies or loose parodies of his alter-ego Harold. Production of the sitcom was {{in the last few}} years stressful as Brambell was an alcoholic, often ill-prepared for rehearsals and forgetting his lines and movements. A tour of a Steptoe and Son stage show in Australia in 1977 proved a disaster due to Brambell's drinking. During the tour, the pair appeared in character in an advert for Ajax soap powder.|$|E
500|$|Throughout 2004, {{the band}} {{continued}} to tour {{in support of}} The Artist in the Ambulance. Island Records issued a promotional disc (that features an alternate version of [...] "The Artist in the Ambulance") in early 2004 that would become the basis for If We <b>Could</b> <b>Only</b> <b>See</b> Us Now, a CD/DVD package outlining the group's career. Named after a lyric from [...] "So Strange I Remember You," [...] the CD portion contained live tracks from a performance at the Apple Store and various B-sides. A slot to promote the CD/DVD came on the 2004 Vans Warped Tour.|$|E

Amitabh Bachchan was Karan's first choice for the portrayal of Yash Raichand. Karan added, [...] "As I wrote the film, I realised that Yashvardhan Raichand is the backbone of the film and I <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>see</b> one actor playing the role — Amitabh Bachchan." [...] Bachchan, on his part, agreed to do the film without a script narration. Karan mentioned that he was initially scared to direct a star of the stature of Bachchan, but the latter [...] "soon became an actor instead of a superstar".|$|E

500|$|The makeup for the {{character}} of The Great Mutato was designed and created by special effects supervisor Tony Lindala. The Mutato mask went through several design iterations on paper, including 10–15 drawings and a color rendition. Constructed from latex, and containing an articulated second mouth, it cost $40,000 and took between five and seven hours to apply. In addition to the mask, Chris Owens wore contact lenses and dentures. Owens later recalled that [...] "the makeup had taken seven hours, and then I had sat around for three or four. And now I was going {{to sit in the}} dark, and I <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>see</b> out of one eye. They put a big contact lens in." [...] Initial versions of the costume were deemed [...] "too human looking" [...] and so a newer design was chosen.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the Taylor {{report on the}} Hillsborough {{disaster}} was published, which recommended that football stadia become all-seater. The North Bank, which had become home of Arsenal's most passionate supporters, was demolished {{at the end of}} the 1991–92 season. During redevelopment, a giant mural of fans was placed behind the goal at that end, to give the illusion that the players were kicking towards a crowd rather than a construction site. The mural initially attracted criticism for its absence of black fans, which was quickly rectified. Populous (then LOBB Partnership) designed all-seater two-tier North Bank Stand, the last area of Highbury to be refurbished, which was opened in August 1993 at a cost of £20 million amid strong opposition from local residents. The new North Bank Stand contained a museum and a concourse with video arcades, bars, confectionery counters, souvenir shops and fast-food stands. [...] While the all-seater North Bank was [...] "never the same as the old-fashioned Archibald Leitch stand" [...] that it replaced, it was [...] "much more like the future of Arsenal than the past" [...] with its added amenities and [...] "Gone were the days of pushing a petrified child through a packed crowd and placing them on a barrier from which they <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>see</b> a small section of the pitch". The old stand had received a fitting send off with a 5–1 defeat of Southampton, though the new stand had a less auspicious start, the first game being a surprise 0–3 defeat to Coventry City with all 3 goals coming from striker Micky Quinn. The first victory came 10 days later against Leeds United.|$|E

2500|$|Marshal Lannes had {{orders to}} cross the Narew at Pułtusk with his corps. [...] He was aware {{that there was a}} Russian force in front of him, but did not know its size.

The vehicle had trouble negotiating the terrain, and proved unsuitable for reconnaissance because, while [...] "buttoned-up", the crew <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>see</b> the road ahead of them. The lack of a radio made coordination among vehicles in a platoon or larger-sized formation impossible.|$|E

2500|$|The early Christian {{community}} was perceived {{at times to}} be an intrinsically destabilising influence and threat to the peace of Rome, a [...] religio illicita. The pagans who attributed the misfortunes of Rome and its wider Empire {{to the rise of}} Christianity, and who <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>see</b> a restoration by a return to the old ways, were faced by the Christian Church that had set itself apart from that faith and was unwilling to dilute what it held to be the religion of the [...] "One True God".|$|E
2500|$|The {{work was}} {{followed}} by a similar monograph on Constantin Stere, seen by Augustin Buzura as [...] "a revelation". Its final section, largely dealing with the uncomfortable subject of Stere's Germanophilia, <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>see</b> print after the end of communism, and, according to Rizescu, influenced an entire generation's view of Poporanist foreign policy. This contribution was however criticized by Lucian Boia. Boia described the monograph as [...] "fundamental", but found that Ornea was lenient and partisan on the issue of Stere's links with the Central Powers in the World War I occupation of Romania.|$|E
2500|$|The {{voice of}} Howard, Chip Zien, was not cast until after {{shooting}} completed. Because Ed Gale's voice {{was difficult to}} hear when he wore his suit, Huyck ordered Gale to perform his scenes without speaking any of the required dialogue, which was later synchronized during the editing process. Lead puppeteer Tim Rose was given a microphone attached to a small speaker, which would allow Rose to speak the dialogue to help the actors respond to Howard's dialogue. While wearing his suit, Gale <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>see</b> through Howard's mouth, and had to sense his location without proper eyesight. Gale often had to walk backwards before beginning rehearsals. In between takes, a hair dryer was stuffed in Howard's bill to keep Gale cool. Gale taped two of his fingers together [...] to wear the three-fingered hands created for the Howard costume. A total of six actors gave physical performances as Howard.|$|E

2500|$|In July Saladin laid siege to Tiberias, where Raymond III's wife Eschiva was trapped. In {{spite of}} this Raymond argued that Guy should not engage Saladin in battle, and that Saladin could not hold Tiberias because his troops would not stand {{to be away from}} their {{families}} for so long. The Knights Hospitaller also advised Guy not to provoke Saladin. However, Gerard de Ridefort advised Guy to advance against Saladin, and Guy took his advice. Norman Housley suggests that this was because [...] "the minds of both men had been so poisoned by the political conflict 1180-87 that they <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>see</b> Raymond's advice as designed to bring them personal ruin", and also because he had spent Henry II of England's donations in calling the army, and was reluctant to disband it without a battle. This was a gamble on Guy's part, as he left only a few knights to defend the city of Jerusalem.|$|E
2500|$|Writing in {{a review}} of Absinthe, Paul Carr of The Huffington Post, proclaimed [...] "If I <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>see</b> one show my entire life," [...] he said, [...] "I'd want it to be that." [...] In 2011, it was named [...] "Best New Show" [...] by Vegas Seven Magazine. Stage and Cinema {{described}} the show as [...] "inevitably and thoroughly cringe-inducing," [...] due to the vulgarity of the lead characters. Overall, the website noted a target demographic of 20- to 30-year-olds who have been [...] "well-served alcoholically," [...] in attendance. Northwest Indiana Times writer Philip Potempa describes character Penny Pibbet's as being [...] "too much of a vulgar approach to shocking the audience," [...] as a character, he does, however, acknowledge the [...] "all-so-amazing" [...] performers, including Melody Sweets. He compares Sweets to the character of the Green Fairy played by Kylie Minogue in the 2001 film Moulin Rouge! Absinthe has been described as part of the burlesque revival in Las Vegas by USA Today.|$|E
2500|$|Captain Robert Stopford on Phaeton {{signaled}} to Cornwallis that the French fleet contained 30 vessels, {{but did not}} return to join Cornwallis, causing the British admiral to misunderstand the signal to mean that the French ships, while more numerous than his own, were of inferior strength. Under this misapprehension, Cornwallis, who <b>could</b> <b>only</b> <b>see</b> the ship's sails rather than their hulls, ordered his squadron to advance on the French fleet. Stopford subsequently signaled the exact composition of Villaret's fleet at 11:00 and Cornwallis, realising his error, issued urgent orders for his squadron to haul away to the southwest, tacking to starboard in an effort to escape pursuit with Brunswick leading the line, followed by Royal Sovereign, Bellerophon, Triumph and Mars. [...] Phaeton was sent to scout ahead, while Pallas was ordered to keep company with Royal Sovereign in order to relay Cornwallis's signals {{to the rest of the}} squadron. Villaret had immediately ordered his fleet to give chase, and the French followed the British south westwards into the Atlantic, taking advantage of the strengthening wind.|$|E
