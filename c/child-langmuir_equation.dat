50|$|The {{emission}} current as given above is many {{times greater than}} that normally collected by the electrodes, except in some pulsed valves such as the cavity magnetron. Most of the electrons emitted by the cathode are driven back to it by the repulsion of the cloud of electrons in its neighborhood. This is called the space charge effect. In the limit of large current densities, J is given by the <b>Child-Langmuir</b> <b>equation</b> below, {{rather than by the}} thermionic emission equation above.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Boltzmann–Poisson system {{modeling}} the electron flow in semiconductors {{is used to}} discuss {{the validity of the}} Child–Langmuir asymptotics. The scattering kernel is approximated by a simple relaxation time operator. The Child–Langmuir limit gives an approximation of the currentvoltage characteristic curves by means of a scaling procedure in which the ballistic velocity is much larger that the thermal one. We discuss the validity of the Child–Langmuir regime by performing detailed numerical comparisons between the simulation of the Boltzmann–Poisson system and the <b>Child–Langmuir</b> <b>equations</b> in test problems...|$|R
