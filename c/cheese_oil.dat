50|$|On 25 March 1799, the brig Liveley sailed out of Philadelphia {{en route}} to Porto Rico captained by Micheal Alcorn. It was {{captured}} by the French privateer L'Alliance captained by Dupuy on 15 April 1799. The ship was condemned in Basseterre, Guadeloupe with a total loss of cargo which consisted of flour, copper, stills, lard, soap, candles, onions, <b>cheese,</b> <b>oil,</b> razor strops, and bags. A court case claimed the brig had a commission from the President to capture French armed vessels. The ship was insured for $7,000 and John Caldwalader Jr, and Frank S. Pleasonton, heirs to Savage and Dugan sued France for the amount in 1909, over 100 years after the incident.|$|E
50|$|As {{for all the}} {{warships}} of the time, its hull is in oak. Its rigging (masts and yards) is in pine. There {{are also}} elm, linden, poplar and walnut for the carriages of the guns, the sculptures of the fellows, and the interior carpentry. The ropes (80 tons) and sails (about 2,500 m2) are hemp. A second set of emergency sails is stored in the hold. Planned to operate for weeks far from its European bases if necessary, its transport capacities are considerable. It takes three months of consumption of water, supplemented by six months of wine. There are also tens of tons of biscuits, flour, fresh and dried vegetables, meat and salted fish, <b>cheese,</b> <b>oil,</b> vinegar, salt, not to mention live cattle, which will be slaughtered as the campaign progressed.|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out to assess the {{efficiency}} of four plantessentialoils; bay, clove, cinnamon and thyme as naturalfoodpreservatives. The effect of the plantessentialoils at concentrations of 0 · 1, 0 · 5 and 1 % was studied in low-fat and full-fat softcheese against Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enteritidis at 4 ° and 10 °C respectively, over a 14 -day period. The composition of the cheese was shown {{to be an important}} factor in determining the effectiveness of the plantessentialoils. In the low-fat cheese, all four oils at 1 % reduced L. monocytogenes to ≤ 1 · 0 log 10 cfu ml− 1. In contrast, in the full-fat <b>cheese,</b> <b>oil</b> of clove was the only oil to achieve this reduction. Oil of thyme proved ineffective against S. enteritidis in the full-fat cheese, yet was equally as effective as the other three oils in the low-fat cheese, reducing S. enteritidis to ≤ 1 · 0 log 10 cfu ml− 1 from day 4 onwards. It is concluded that selected plantessentialoils can act as potent inhibitors of L. monocytogenes and S. enteritidis in a food product...|$|E

40|$|Three cages (0. 9 m³) were {{stocked with}} 200 channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus Rafinesque, {{fingerlings}} (73. 7 g avg.) in a 1. 5 hectare pond. Two cheese rations were formulated and fed to the catfish; the first consisting of <b>cheese,</b> <b>oil,</b> and vitamin C (C + VC) {{and the second}} consisting of cheese, cottonseed meal, oil, trace minerals, and vitamins (CC + VM). A commercial trout ration (TC) was fed as a control. High mortalities occurred in the C + VC diet, thus resulting in premature removal of that cage from the study (after 86 days). A sample of 50 fish from the two remaining cages, along with harvest data from the C + VC diet, revealed a 45. 6 % difference in average fish weight between the C + VC and CC + VM diets, a 63. 5 % difference between the C + VC diet and TC ration, and 32. 9 % difference between the CC + VM diet and TC ration. Final harvest of CC + VM and TC cages was completed after 134 days. Comparisons revealed that a 38. 3 % difference in average fish weight existed between these two diets. Statistical analysis of data indicated that fish fed the CC + VM diet had a significantly lower percentage dress-out weight and a significantly higher amount of mesenteric fat. This experiment does suggest that cheese scraps, when properly balanced with other essential ingredients, may be utilized as {{a major component of}} catfish rations...|$|E

40|$|Are {{individual}} differences in Body Mass Index (bmi) related to differences in food prices? French food scanner data are used to estimate {{the effect of the}} prices of 23 food product categories covering food-at-home consumption on the bmi distribution in a sample of French adults. Using quantile regressions, we find significant negative elasticities to the prices of <b>cheeses,</b> <b>oils,</b> pastries and deserts, and ready-meals for marginally overweight or obese women and to the prices of non-alcoholic beverages and ready-meals for marginally overweight men. These estimates of the price-bmi regressions should be read cautiously, as omission of unobserved factors such as individual physical activity levels may bias the results.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the acceptance and conservation of Minas fresh <b>cheese</b> with essential <b>oils</b> added of oregano and ginger in its formulation. The quality of the milk used as raw material was evaluated for pH, acidity, alizarol, total solids, density, and total microbial load. The cheeses produced were characterized as pH, acidity, moisture, lipids, proteins and ashes. The cheeses were also evaluated by sensorial affective tests using hedonic and attitude scales, {{in order to determine}} the acceptance and purchase intention by judges. The count of total aerobic mesophilic microorganisms was used to estimate the shelf-life of cheeses. The milk used as raw material is presented within the quality standards required by legislation. The cheeses made with essential oils showed pH and acidity around 6. 9 and 0. 87 %, respectively, 57. 6 % moisture, 31. 3 % lipids, 11. 4 % protein and 0. 9 % ash. The <b>cheese</b> added essential <b>oil</b> of oregano and the control cheese were those given by the judges the best values for acceptance (7. 5 and 7. 6, respectively) and purchase intention (4. 2 and 4. 4 respectively). Regarding the estimated shelf-life, the <b>cheeses</b> added essential <b>oil</b> of oregano and ginger had lower overall microbial load values compared to the control (no oil) and mixed (two oils addition), presented counts values with up 106 UFC/g only from the 28 th day of storage...|$|R
