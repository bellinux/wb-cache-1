50|$|Serological and imaging {{tests are}} {{commonly}} used to diagnose this disease. Frequently used serological tests include antibody tests, ELISA and indirect hemaglutination (IHA). Also, an intradermal allergic reaction test (<b>Casoni</b> <b>test)</b> has also been used to diagnose patients. Imaging tests include: X-rays, cat scans, MRI, and ultrasound.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{among them}} was Tomaso Casoni (1880 - 1933) who practiced there from 1912 to 1932.

30|$|Hydatidosis is {{a common}} {{zoonosis}} that affects humans and animals, especially in poorly-developed countries. In humans, 65 – 75 % of hydatid cysts occur in the liver, 25 % {{are found in the}} lungs, and 5 – 10 % distribute along the peripheral arterial system [2]. Eosinophilia is a non-specific finding in endemic areas [2]. Serum immunoelectrophoresis currently detects 90 % of individuals infected with E. granulosus. <b>Casoni’s</b> <b>test</b> has a sensitivity and specificity of 80 % and 70 %, respectively [2]. The presence of synchronous uterine cysts is very rare [1, 3, 4]. A ruptured hydatid uterine cystic disease without any concomitant abdominal hydatid disease is a rare occurrence, although an acute abdomen secondary to a ruptured liver hydatid cyst is not uncommon in endemic areas.|$|R
40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay {{was done}} {{for the detection of}} immunoglobulin G and M (IgG and IgM) antibodies to Echinococcus granulosus in surgically proved cases of hydatidosis, especially pulmonary hydatidosis, by use of human hydatid cyst fluid antigen and soluble scolex antigen. This assay was compared with the following standardized techniques: the indirect hemagglutination test, the indirect immunofluorescent antibody <b>test,</b> and <b>Casoni's</b> intradermal <b>test.</b> The {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}}, with either of the antigens (human hydatid cyst fluid or soluble scolex antigen), was more sensitive and specific than the other techniques in diagnosing cases of hydatidosis, especially hydatid disease of the lung...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Casoni</b> <b>test</b> is an {{immediate}} hypersensitivity skin test {{used in the}} diagnosis of hydatid disease introduced by casoni. The test involves the intradermal injection of 0.25 ml of sterilised fluid from hydatid cysts/human cyst and sterilised by Seitz filtration on forearm and equal volume of saline injected on the other forearm. Observations made for next 30 mins and after 1 to 2 days.A wheal response occurring at the injection site within 20 minutes is considered positive. (Immediate hypersensitivity). Delayed hypersensitivity reaction usually read after 18-24 hours. [...] The test is positive in about 90% of cases of hydatid disease affecting the liver, but positive in less than 50% of patients with hydatid disease elsewhere in the body; false positive results are also common. Precaution - Being a type I hypersensitivity reaction, anaphylactic reaction tray must be kept ready before carrying out the test.Consequently, serological tests are now generally used.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{combined}} role of <b>Casoni</b> <b>test</b> and indirect haemagglutination (IHA) {{test in the}} diagnosis of hydatid disease. METHODS: Twenty eight suspected cases of hydatid disease were subjected to Casoni intradermal test using commercially available antigen (Span Diagnostics, India) after collecting pre-test serum samples. The serum samples were tested by IHA using an indigenously developed IHA test. RESULTS: Considering the clinical diagnosis of hydatid disease as the gold standard, the specificity of both <b>Casoni</b> <b>test</b> and IHA was 47 &#x 0025;, however, the sensitivity of IHA was higher (81. 8 &#x 0025;) than <b>Casoni</b> <b>test</b> (63. 8 &#x 0025;). With the two tests considered together the sensitivity was 90. 9 &#x 0025;. CONCLUSIONS: Combined use of <b>Casoni</b> <b>test</b> and IHA test could establish presumptive and cost effective diagnosis in upto 90. 9 &#x 0025; of clinically suspected cases of hydatid disease...|$|E

Materials and Methods : Hospital and follow-up records of 11 patients with hydatid cyst of the urinary tract were reviewed and {{data on the}} patients’ symptoms and signs at presentation, radiological findings, diagnostic tests, pathologic findings, and surgical outcomes were reviewed. Results : The chief complaint was flank pain in 7 patients (63. 6 %). Hydaturia was not seen in any of our patients. Ten patients had renal involvement and 1 had a retrovesical hydatid cyst. Eosinophilia was detected in 2 of 11 patients who were tested. A positive indirect hemagglutination test was seen in 4 of 7 patients and a positive <b>Casoni</b> <b>test</b> in 1 of 2. Intravenous urography revealed caliceal distortion in 6 patients (54. 5 %), caliectasis in 3 (27. 3 %), and nonfunctioning kidney in 2 (18. 2 %). Ultrasonography showed a complex cyst {{in all of the}} patients. Computed tomography demonstrated multivesicular cystic structure in 4 patients (36. 4 %), complex cyst in 4 (36. 4 %), and a simple cyst in 3 (27. 3 %). Definite diagnosis was made only after surgical operation. We performed nephrectomy in 2 patients (18. 2 %), partial nephrectomy in 2 (18. 2 %), cystectomy plus marsupialization in 5 (45. 4 %), and retrovesical surgery in 1 (9. 1 %). One patient refused surgical treatment. There was no perioperative major complication. Conclusion : Renal hydatidosis is a rare entity and the main challenge is preoperative diagnosis. Radiological and serologic studies, although indicative, cannot confirm the diagnosis, and only pathologic examination after surgical removal can confirm echinococcal infection. </spa...|$|E
40|$|Two {{case reports}} of Echinococcus granulosus disease are {{presented}} in detail, together with a survey of 35 cases of the disease encountered in Toronto hospitals since 1932; 32 of these have occurred since 1949. Only six of the 35 patients were born in and lived in Canada, {{and all of these}} came from Northern Ontario. The liver was involved in 20 of the 35 patients, and the lung in 16. In seven the lesions were multiple {{at the time of the}} first operation or several years later. The <b>Casoni</b> skin <b>test</b> was positive in 14 of 21 patients tested and the complement fixation test was positive in 13 of 16 subjects tested.

40|$|Two {{species of}} Echinococcus occur in Canada: (1) E. multilocularis and (2) E. granulosus. E. multilocularis, {{originating}} in the Arctic, is spreading southwards and has reached Saskatchewan and the Dakotas. The original hosts are foxes but dogs and cats are alternatives. The larvae occur in field mice as multilocular microcysts containing numerous protoscolices, but in man the cysts are alveolar and sterile and resemble both in histology and growth a cholangiocellular carcinoma of the liver with metastases. Signs and symptoms are chronic and poorly defined. Diagnosis is difficult. Test antigens are not yet satisfactory. E. granulosus has a sylvatic cycle, the adult tapeworms living in wolves and dogs, while the larvae occur only in Cervidae and man. The cysts occur almost exclusively in the lungs as unilocular, macrocystic, relatively benign tumours, although abnormal complications can occur. The <b>Casoni</b> intradermal sensitivity <b>test,</b> its technique and interpretation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} 10 {{years we have}} {{operated}} on 33 cases of hydatid cyst of the liver with intrathoracic rupture. Twenty-one out of 33 cases ruptured into bronchi, in seven the rupture affected the pleural cavity, and in six simultaneous rupture into the bronchus and pleural cavity occurred. Laboratory tests were not carried out in all cases. The <b>Casoni</b> intradermal <b>test</b> {{was carried out in}} 23 cases and was positive in 18. A liver scan was performed in 10 and was positive in all. Conservative operations were carried out in 22 patients. In these the hepatic cavity was evacuated and separately drained. This was followed by suturing the diaphragmatic rupture and also closing the bronchial opening if present. Lung resections were performed in 11 out of 33 cases. In eight lobectomy was carried out and in three segmental resections. Resection was necessary when suppuration and bronchiectatic changes affected the lung. Ruptured cyst into the pleural cavity requires emergency thoracotomy after the anaphylactic shock is over. Removal of the parasite, re-expansion of the lung, and drainage of the pleural and hepatic cavities is necessary. Immediate and late complications occurred in 13 patients. In two postoperative haemorrhage occurred and in two postoperative empyema developed. Recurrent haemoptysis was seen in five, persistent bile fistula in one, and dissemination of hydatid cyst in three. In the remaining 20 cases there was no complication. Operative mortality was nil...|$|R
40|$|Of 1055 {{patients}} treated surgically for pulmonary hydatid disease, most (950) had isolated lung cysts, the other 105 having both liver and lung cysts. The chest radiograph was most valuable in diagnosis; the <b>Casoni</b> and Weinberg <b>tests</b> and blood eosinophil counts {{were found to}} be diagnostically unreliable. One thousand and seventy seven primary operations were performed. Cystotomy and capitonnage were carried out in 906 patients, 40 of whom also had decortication of the pleura. Other procedures included cystotomy with wedge resection of locally damaged lung (29 patients) and cyst removal with capitonnage by Ugon's method (33) or the Perez-Fontana procedure (8) and with costal resection for osteomyelitis in two cases. More radical surgery was carried out in 99 patients for longstanding infection or severe lung destruction. Postoperative complications occurred in 37 patients (3. 5 %) and the 30 day mortality rate was 1. 7 %. It is concluded that a lung conserving surgical operation is the treatment of choice for most patients with pulmonary hydatid disease. In patients with coexisting liver cysts the thoracic transpleural approach allowed the lung and liver cysts to be removed at the same session...|$|R
40|$|SIN c E {{the early}} years of this century the complement-fixation test (CFT) (Ghedini, 1906) and the {{intradermal}} <b>test</b> (<b>Casoni,</b> 1911) have both been used extensively for the diagnosis of hydatid disease and there have been many publications of the results of their use (table I). The variations in the percentage of positive results reported probably arose because of the use of different antigen preparations and different methods of performing the tests: hydatid fluids were procured from man, sheep and other infected animals, and were used as whole fluids, undiluted and diluted, or as alcoholic, acid or other extracts; different quantities of fluid were injected in the skin test, and a great number of modifica-tions in technique, which would affect the sensitivity of the test, were used in complement fixation. Some years ago Bensted and Atkinson (1 953) redirected attention to the need for standardisation of the reagents to be used in complement-fixation and intradermal tests, and in a small number of cases in which the diagnosis of hydatid disease was confirmed they found that the two tests were reliable and that they showed good correlation. Since then the tests have been used exten...|$|R

40|$|Tomaso Casoni (Figure 1 A & 1 B) {{earned his}} fame by the test {{named after him}} [1]. Casoni was first to {{describe}} a test for immediate allergic reaction to hydatid fluid injected into the skin (Figure 2). This was {{in a time when}} hydatid disease caused by infection by Echinococcus granlulosus was endemic in Europe, Africa and the Middle East in addition to many other parts of the world. Therefore such finding was of great clinical significance at that time. However, as the skin test was increasingly replaced by other serological diagnostic methodology [2], the credit to Casoni has been fading away from the memory of medical and scientific community except for a few old Italian monographs [3 - 5]. There is a paucity of information on his life and works in the English literature even in the specialized web pages dedicated to history of science and medicine. A search using “Tomaso Casoni” as the search term on the internet’s two most commonly used search engines (Yahoo and Google) failed to find any substantial material. Thirty years ago, I was amongst a group of junior medical students in Tripoli, Libya. We learned for the first time about <b>Casoni</b> and his <b>test</b> from a small print foot note in “Bailey and Love’s Short Practice of Surgery”. We were so pleased that such a major textbook mentioned the institution where we were studying though its name changed to “Tripoli Central Hospital” following the independence of Libya. This event stimulated the interest of many in the history of science and medicine...|$|R
