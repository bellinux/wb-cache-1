5|$|German {{geographer}} Karl Sapper {{visited the}} ruins in 1896 and published {{a brief description}} of the ruins together with a site map two years later in a 6-page pamphlet by the Internationales Archiv für Ethnographie of Leyden in the Netherlands, entitled Die Ruinen von Mixco, Guatemala. It was Sapper who labelled each of the archaeological groups and their attendant structures. American archaeologist A. Ledyard Smith visited the ruins in 1949 and wrote a chapter about the site in his Archaeological Reconnaissance in Central America, published by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1955. Archeological excavations were carried out from 1954 through 1967 by the Musée de l'Homme of Paris under the direction of archaeologist Henri Lehmann, who <b>certainly</b> <b>believed</b> that he was excavating the Pocomam capital as described in Colonial records.|$|E
5|$|The Chronicle of Melrose reports Clement's death {{under the}} year 1258. Clement's legacy {{was to be}} remembered as the restorer of the diocese of Dunblane and the builder of its cathedral. Thus for future generations, Clement became the father-figure of the see. Clement was later commemorated as a saint, though there is no record of formal canonisation. He was commemorated on 19 March, meaning that was almost <b>certainly</b> <b>believed</b> to have been the date of his death. Clement's death was also noted by Walter Bower, a Lowland Scottish {{historian}} writing in the 1440s, who included the following obituary: Clement bishop of Dunblane died, that outstanding member of the Order of Preachers, a man most eloquent in translating various tongues, powerful in speech and action in the sight of God and of men. He found the cathedral church of his diocese reduced by the neglect of his predecessors to such a state of decay that the divine offices were celebrated in it scarcely three times a week, as if it were some rural chapel. He built it up to be a hallowed sanctuary, enriched it with lands and possessions, and increased its prestige by adding prebends and canonries. Such flattering sentiments had even been expressed during Clement's lifetime. In 1250, the General Chapter of the Dominican Order met in London, and decreed that: we grant to Friar Clement of our Order, a bishop of Scotland, after his death, one mass throughout the Order by every friar whomsoever is a priest. Although there survives a sermon almost certainly written by him, Clement was also credited with being a prolific translator and writing four books (including a hagiography of St Dominic), all of which are now lost.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} with the design, Roosevelt {{was very pleased}} with the new double eagle. [...] Mint Director Leach recalled that when [...] "I laid upon his desk a sample of beautifully executed double eagles of the Saint-Gaudens design, he was most enthusiastic in his expressions of pleasure and satisfaction.

2500|$|Donnchad was {{certainly}} married to Bé Fáil ingen Cathail, daughter of Cathal mac Muiredaig, eponym of the Leth Cathail in Ulster. Her death is {{recorded by the}} Annals of Ulster in 801: [...] "Be Fáil daughter of Cathal, Donnchad's queen, died." [...] Their children included Óengus and Máel Ruanaid. [...] Donnchad is less <b>certainly</b> <b>believed</b> to have been married to one Fuirseach, daughter of a Dál nAraidi king named Congal, said to have borne him Conchobar. The mother of his sons Ailill, Conn, Domnall and Falloman and his daughters Gormlaith and Euginis is not recorded. Eithne, who married Bran Ardchenn, King of Leinster, is sometimes called Donnchad's daughter but was more probably his sister.|$|E
2500|$|In around 1796 Storace began a long {{liaison with}} the tenor John Braham, though they never married. Their {{break-up}} in 1815 was acrimonious {{and may have}} contributed to Storace's sudden death the following year; at any rate their son, William Spencer Harris Braham, <b>certainly</b> <b>believed</b> it had. Spencer, who had become an Anglican clergyman and a minor canon of Canterbury Cathedral, years later sought and obtained leave from Queen Victoria to change his family's name to Meadows, his petition having been received on the ground that his wife was the sole heir of her maternal grandfather of that name. In his mother's will, bequeathing property to the amount of £50,000, she styled herself a [...] "spinster", though legally speaking she died a widow, predeceasing her widowed mother.|$|E
2500|$|Trevelyan's own {{personality}} is enigmatic, with its undertones of racial prejudice and authoritarianism. He could defend his emigrants against the criticisms of Robert Lowe and {{the critics of}} his schemes in New South Wales, but he could also contemplate with satisfaction [...] "the prospect of flights of Germans settling here in increasing numbers - an orderly, moral, industrious and frugal people, less foreign {{to us that the}} Irish or Scotch Celt, a congenial element which will readily assimilate with our body politic". He <b>certainly</b> <b>believed</b> that he was benefiting both Britain and the Highlanders, for he wrote on another occasion, [...] "The Irish and Scotch, especially the latter, do much better when they have a fresh start in other countries, and become mixed up with other people, than when they stay at home".|$|E

60|$|He did not: he did {{obtain the}} whole ballad from Hogg, who {{got it from}} recitation--as I believe, and try to prove, and as Scott <b>certainly</b> <b>believed.</b> The facts in the case exist in {{published}} works, and in manuscript letters of Ritson to Scott, and Hogg to Scott, and in the original MS. of the song, with a note by Hogg to Laidlaw. If {{we are interested in}} the truth about the matter, we ought at least to read the very accessible material before bringing charges against the Sheriff and the Shepherd of Ettrick.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would seem}} to explain the whole matter that has puzzled us so. I did not tell you, {{because it was not}} in my opinion at all {{necessary}} to the case, that Miss Covington has always maintained that the man was not Simcoe, and so positive was she that her friend, Miss Purcell, went down to Stowmarket to make inquiries. It was <b>certainly</b> <b>believed</b> by his friends there that he was Simcoe, and this to my mind was quite conclusive. But I am bound to say that it did not satisfy Miss Covington." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{should like}} very much to know how far they have got on with the cloth,' thought the Emperor.

Now he <b>certainly</b> <b>believed</b> that he had nothing to fear for himself, but he wanted first to send {{somebody}} else in order to see how he stood with regard to his office. Everybody in the whole town knew what a wonderful power the cloth had, and they were all curious to see how bad or how stupid their neighbour was.|$|E

60|$|This text {{is often}} {{held to be}} a prophecy of the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

60|$|She {{looked at}} him now with {{something}} like amazement. This, then, accounted for the sombreness of his clothes and his little strip of white tie. She had only the vaguest ideas as to the conduct of those various sects to be met with in English villages, but she had <b>certainly</b> <b>believed</b> that the post of preacher was filled indifferently by {{any member of the}} congregation, and she had looked upon his presence in the pulpit on that last Sunday as an accident. To associate him with such an occupation permanently seemed to her little short of the ridiculous. She laughed softly, showing, for the first time, her brilliantly white teeth, and his cheeks were stained with scarlet.|$|E
6000|$|A race of wild men, called [...] "Harrum-mo," [...] {{are said}} to inhabit {{the head of the}} valley, living in the woods of a {{district}} called Mund-po, beyond Bah; they shun habitations, speak an unintelligible tongue, have more hair on the face than Lepchas, and do not plait that of their heads, but wear it in a knot; they use the bow and arrow, and eat snakes and vermin, which the Lepchas will not touch. Such is the account I have heard, and which is <b>certainly</b> <b>believed</b> in Sikkim: similar stories are very current in half civilized countries; and if this has any truth, it possibly refers to the Chepangs,* [Hodgson, in [...] "Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal" [...] for 1848.] a very remarkable race, of doubtful affinity and origin, inhabiting the Nepal forests.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} hard upon Mr. Grey, because he {{certainly}} was an honest man and had taken up the matter simply {{with a view of}} learning the truth. It had been whispered to him within the last day or two that Mountjoy Scarborough had lately been seen alive, and gambling with reckless prodigality, at Monte Carlo. It had only been told to him as probably true, but he <b>certainly</b> <b>believed</b> it. But he knew nothing of the details of his disappearance, and had not been much surprised, as he had never believed that the young man had been murdered or had made away with himself. But he had heard before that of the quarrel in the street between him and Harry Annesley; and the story had been told to him so as to fall with great discredit on Harry Annesley's head.|$|E
5000|$|NAACP Chapter President Willis Edwards {{said in a}} {{statement}} at the time, [...] "We <b>certainly</b> <b>believe</b> it is possible to use humor to reveal the ridiculousness of racism.

50|$|Classical deists who {{adhere to}} Herbert's common notion <b>certainly</b> <b>believe</b> in a {{personal}} God, because those notions include the belief that God dispenses rewards and punishments both in this life and after it. This is not something which would be done by an impersonal force. However, {{a personal relationship with}} God is not contemplated, since living a virtuous and pious life is seen as the primary means of worshiping God.|$|R
60|$|To {{be left to}} {{pass the}} evening by herself was irksome to her at any time, and this evening it was more irksome than usual by reason of the excitements of the past hours. The two visits had stirred her into restlessness. She was not wrought to any great pitch of uneasiness by the {{probability}} of appearing in an ill light in the discussion between Clym and his mother, but she was wrought to vexation; and her slumbering activities were quickened {{to the extent of}} wishing that she had opened the door. She had <b>certainly</b> <b>believed</b> that Clym was awake, and the excuse would be an honest one as far as it went; but nothing could save her from censure in refusing to answer at the first knock. Yet, instead of blaming herself for the issue she laid the fault upon the shoulders of some indistinct, colossal Prince of the World, who had framed her situation and ruled her lot.|$|E
6000|$|... "On Sundays I {{assembled}} {{the men and}} women, little boys and girls, in the chapel; all came to my appointment with an incredible joy, and most ardent desire to hear the word of God. I began with the confessing God to be one in nature, and trine in Persons; I afterwards repeated distinctly, and with an audible voice, the Lord's prayer, the angelical salutation, and the apostles' creed. All of them together repeated after me; and it is hardly to be imagined what pleasure they took in it. This being done, I repeated the creed singly; and, insisting on every particular article, asked, if they <b>certainly</b> <b>believed</b> it? They all protested to me, with loud cries, and their hands across their breasts, that they firmly believed it. My practice is, to make them repeat the creed oftener than the other prayers; and I declare to them, at the same time, that they who believe the contents of it are true Christians.|$|E
6000|$|The {{whole thing}} was upon him, in any case, with the minimum of delay: Bob had had it from her, definitely, {{the first of the}} week, and it was {{absolutely}} final now, that they must set up avowedly separate lives--without horrible [...] "proceedings" [...] of any sort, but with her own situation, her independence, secured to her once for all. She had been coming to it, taking her time, and she had gone through--well, so old a friend would guess enough what; but she was at the point, oh blessedly now, where she meant to stay, he'd see if she didn't; with which, in this wonderful way, he himself had arrived for the cream of it and she was just selfishly glad. Bob had gone to Washington--ostensibly on business, but really to recover breath; she had, speaking vulgarly, knocked the wind out of him and was allowing him time to turn round. Mrs. Folliott moreover, she was sure, would have gone--was <b>certainly</b> <b>believed</b> to have been seen there five days ago; and of course his first necessity, for public use, would be to patch up something with Mrs. Folliott.
