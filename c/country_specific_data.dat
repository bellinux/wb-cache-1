40|$|Under the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change all Parties have {{to report}} on carbon {{emissions}} and removals from the forestry sector. Each Party can use its own approach and <b>country</b> <b>specific</b> <b>data</b> for this. Independently, large-scale models exist (e. g. EFISCEN and G 4 M as used in this study) that assess emissions and removals from this sector by applying a unified approach to each country, still often based on <b>country</b> <b>specific</b> <b>data.</b> Differences exist between the national reported values and the calculations from the large scale models. This study compares these models with national reporting efforts for 24 EU countries for the period 2000 – 2008, and identifies the most likely causes for differences. There are no directly identifiable single input parameters that could be targeted to fully {{close the gap between}} country and model estimates. We found that the method applied by the country (i. e. stock-difference or gain-loss) contributes significantly to differences for EFISCEN and was the best explaining variable for G 4 M, although for the latter it was not significant. Other variables (biomass expansion factors, harvest volumes and the way harvest losses are treated) were not found to provide a conclusive explanation for the differences between the model estimations and the country submissions in an over-al analysis. However, at the level of individual countries several different causes for differences were identified. This suggests that to really close the gap between country submissions and large scale models, close collaboration between modellers and country experts is needed, calling for openness and willingness to share relevant data and to compare GHG inventories with independent estimates. This would enable to improve the confidence both in historical GHG inventories and in the models which are needed to project the future forest sink for several policy issues...|$|E

The main result allowed the following interpretations: (a) {{an important part of the}} traditional external debt contracted with constraint is going back out of the continent as capital flight and; (b) The capital flight contributes to improving the level of poverty in Africa. Overall, we can conclude that the contribution to economic development depends on the origin of loans received and, fostering the economic relations with China could be an excellent alternative for FZ countries.

Despite the {{significant}} number of research institutions and rich scientific heritage, published research from Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan) is traditionally underrepresented in international scientific literature. The goal {{of this paper was}} to analyze publication patterns in Central Asian countries, and to explore the factors that contributed to the publication productivity in Kazakhstan. Methods. Publication  productivity was evaluated using data generated by the SCImago Journal & Country Rank over the period of 1996 - 2014 for all of the 15 former Soviet Union Republics for all subject categories. <b>Country</b> <b>specific</b> <b>data,</b> including total population, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, research and development (R&D) expenditure (% of GDP), number of reserchers (per million people), was abstracted from World Bank data.

This paper analyses {{the impact of}} Portugal’s accession to the EU in terms of employees’ earnings inequality using data for the years 1985 and 1991 at the Concelhos level from the Quadros de Pessoal database. The two earnings distributions are compared using cardinal measures of inequality and the Lorenz stochastic dominance approach (Araar Abelkrim and Jean-Ives Duclos). The Relative Distribution approach (Mark S.

MethodsA total of 294 patients (mean age: 50. 4  ±  15. 1 years; females: 80. 3 %) diagnosed with persistent asthma were included in this retrospective study upon their admission to the hospital with an acute asthma attack. Patient demographics, asthma control level, asthma attack severity and the management of the attack were evaluated. ResultsThere was no influence of gender on asthma control and attack severity. In 57. 5 % of the patients, asthma attack was moderate. Most patients (78. 9 %) were hospitalized with longer duration evident in the severe attack. Spirometry and chest X-Ray were the most frequent tests (85. 4 %), while steroids (72. 0 % parenteral; 29. 0 % oral) and short-acting beta-agonists (SABA)  + anticholinergics (45. 5 %) were the main drugs of choice in the attack management. Attack severity and pre-attack asthma control level was significantly correlated (p <  0. 001). Pre-attack asthma was uncontrolled in 42. 6 % of the patients with severe attack.

From these, results using a standardized dataset for four regions {{in the world could}} be obtained for three specific applications. Results Despite differences in the approaches and individual constituting elements including costs, QALYs Quality Adjusted Life Years and deaths, cost-effectiveness results of the models were quite similar. Differences between the models on the individual components of cost-effectiveness could be related to some specific features of the respective models. Sensitivity analysis revealed that cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination is highly sensitive to vaccine prices, rotavirus-associated mortality and discount rates, in particular that for QALYs. Conclusions The comparative approach followed here is helpful in understanding the various models selected and will thus benefit (low-income) countries in designing their own cost-effectiveness analyses using new or adapted existing models.

With no reserves of phosphorus source in Spain, increased dependence on phosphorus in agriculture have not only increased dependence on imports but also has raised concerns on its future availability as a resource. A Phosphorous Flow Analysis (PFA) was conducted for Spain for the year 2012 focusing on the food production and consumption systems. The results obtained were finally compared with PFA at both country level and continent level (EU- 27). To quantify food and non-food flows systems, <b>country</b> <b>specific</b> <b>data</b> were considered. The sectors covered were crop production (CP), animal production (AP), food processing (FP), non-food production (NF) and consumption (HC). The findings reveal that a total of 325 kt P was imported by Spain in 2012; 66 % of which was accumulated in markets stock of food and feed, fertilizers and non-food (91 kt P) while 33 % was lost to the environment through land-fill, losses to water bodies, land accumulation and incineration. The largest proportion of losses is associated with water bodies (44. 7 kt P) followed by agriculture and land accumulation (42. 1 kt P). Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) received around 79. 5 kt P within wastewater, with 60 % being removed in sewage sludge. The 31. 7 kt P discharged within final effluent represented the 71 % of the total losses to water bodies.

40|$|By Hansjörg Blöchliger and Claire Charbit Fiscal {{equalisation}} is {{a transfer}} of fiscal resources across jurisdictions to offset disparities in revenue raising capacity or public service cost. It covers on average 2. 5 % of GDP or 5 % of total government expenditure across OECD countries. Equalisation reduces fiscal disparities by two-thirds on average and in some countries levels them virtually out. Strong equalisation comes at a price: on average, around 70 % of a jurisdiction’s additional tax income must be dedicated to an equalisation fund. The equalisation rate is generally higher for jurisdictions with low fiscal capacity, reducing their tax effort and likely to slow down regional economic convergence. Cost equalisation is larger than revenue equalisation in terms of GDP despite smaller cost disparities, pointing at inefficiencies in the distribution formulae. Fiscal equalisation can be pro-cyclical but most countries succeed in reducing fluctuations of entitlements, sometimes {{at the cost of}} sub-central budget needs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a {{major public}} health problem in many {{developing}} countries where health education, sanitation, and meat inspection infrastructure are insufficient. The condition occurs when humans ingest eggs of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium, which then develop into larvae in the central nervous system. Although NCC is endemic {{in many areas of the}} world and is associated with considerable socio-economic losses, the burden of NCC remains largely unknown. This study provides the first estimate of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with NCC in Mexico. METHODS: DALYs lost for symptomatic cases of NCC in Mexico were estimated by incorporating morbidity and mortality due to NCC-associated epilepsy, and morbidity due to NCC-associated severe chronic headaches. Latin hypercube sampling methods were employed to sample the distributions of uncertain parameters and to estimate 95 % credible regions (95 % CRs). FINDINGS: In Mexico, 144, 433 and 98, 520 individuals are estimated to suffer from NCC-associated epilepsy and NCC-associated severe chronic headaches, respectively. A total of 25, 341 (95 % CR: 12, 569 - 46, 640) DALYs were estimated to be lost due to these clinical manifestations, with 0. 25 (95 % CR: 0. 12 - 0. 46) DALY lost per 1, 000 person-years of which 90 % was due to NCC-associated epilepsy. CONCLUSION: This is the first estimate of DALYs associated with NCC in Mexico.

In addition, due to limited <b>country</b> <b>specific</b> <b>data,</b> some parameters used in the analysis were based on systematic reviews of the literature or primary research from other geographic locations. Even with these limitations, our estimates suggest that healthy years of life are being lost due to NCC in Mexico...|$|E

Of fifteen variables correlating to RSVH, five independent risk factors were identified: older siblings (OR 3. 8; 95 % CI 1. 97, 7. 41), being Caucasian (OR 2. 3; 95 % CI; 1. 04, 5. 29), neonatal respiratory morbidity (OR 2. 2; 95 % CI; 1. 28, 3. 94); birth 15 July-Dec 15 th (OR 2. 1; 95 % CI; 1. 09, 3. 92) and family history of asthma (OR 1. 9; 95 % CI; 1. 01, 3. 39). Birth 36 weeks to 36 + 6 days mitigated RSVH risk (RR 0. 58; 95 % CI; 0. 34, 0. 99), however risk factors were similar to the 32 - 35 weeks GA cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal respiratory morbidity or being Caucasian were population specific independent risk factors for RSVH in 32 - 36 weeks GA in Ireland whereas the other identified independent risk factors mirrored those established in previous studies...|$|E
40|$|Should {{exporters}} {{worry about}} country-of-origin bias? Although {{the pervasiveness of}} country-level product advertising suggests that they do, lack of data has limited the empirical study of subjective bias toward products from a <b>specific</b> <b>country.</b> Using <b>data</b> from the U. S. wine industry, including numerical blind tasting evaluations, this paper directly computes the impact of country-of-origin bias upon wine import prices. A hedonic pricing framework is used to control for vintage, blind-tasted quality, varietals, production costs and quantities. Cross-country comparisons of price residuals suggest that "Product of Italy" on the label can raise {{the price of a}} bottle by more than fifty percent...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} intsvy, an R {{package for}} working with international assessment data (e. g. PISA, TIMSS, PIRLS). The package includes functions for importing data, performing data analysis, and visualising results. The paper describes the underlying methodology and provides real data examples. Tools for importing data allow useRs to select variables from student, home, school, and teacher survey instruments {{as well as for}} <b>specific</b> <b>countries.</b> <b>Data</b> analysis functions take into account the complex sample design (with replicate weights) and rotated test forms (with plausible achievement values) in the calculation of point estimates and standard errors of means, standard deviations, regression coefficients, correlation coefficients, and frequency tables. Visualisation tools present data aggregates in standardised graphical form...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Pneumococcal {{conjugate}} vaccines {{are expensive}} relative {{to those in}} the EPI systems of low-income countries. The current single-dose presentation costs more to store in the cold chain relative to multi-dose presentations but also has lower wastage rates. It is, therefore, important to determine the optimal balance of vial size and storage costs after adjusting for wastage. Objectives: To project the cost implications of wastage when vaccine wastage rates vary across vial sizes using <b>country</b> <b>specific</b> wastage <b>data.</b> Methods: For each potential vial size, we estimated cold chain costs and the cost of wasted vaccine doses using country level wastage data and projections of the price per dose of vaccine and cold chain storage. Results: Only 19 (26 %) of 72 GAVI eligible countries had analyzable wastage data at WHO/HQ. The median wastage rates for single, 2 - and 10 -dose vials were 5 %, 7 % and 10 % respectively. However wastage varied between 1 %- 10 %, 1 %- 27 % and 4 %- 44 % for single, 2 - and 10 -dose vials respectively. The increased variance for multi-dose vial wastage implied wastage costs potentially greater than the savings realized from lower storage volumes. Conclusions: The optimal vial-size for PCV is dependent upon <b>country</b> <b>specific</b> wastage rates but few countries have these data. There may be a role for both single and multi-dose vials that is best determined by local management and storage capacities making local wastage data critical. Without effective wastage monitoring and control there is a risk that wastage costs will possibly exceed the savings from multi-dose vials’ lower storage costs...|$|R
