A printing program could send zero or more tabs to get to the <b>closest</b> <b>tab</b> stop above and left of where it wanted to print, then send line feeds and spaces to get to the final location.

Stanton was a staunchly Unionist pro-business conservative Democrat who moved toward the Radical Republican faction. Nevertheless, he worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official. [...] "Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together," [...] say Thomas and Hyman.|$|R

However, the fog delay and the international situation leading up to World War II made it impossible, as is seen in an archived signed letter.|$|R

In general, journalists strive for a “good mix” between customization to achieve audience satisfaction and a desire for editorial independence...|$|R
