5|$|The {{education}} system features a non-compulsory kindergarten education followed by {{six years of}} compulsory primary education, and five years of optional secondary education. Schools in the primary {{education system}} are divided into two categories: national primary schools, which teach in Malay, and vernacular schools, which teach in <b>Chinese</b> <b>or</b> Tamil. Secondary education is conducted for five years. In {{the final year of}} secondary education, students sit for the Malaysian Certificate of Education examination. Since the introduction of the matriculation programme in 1999, students who completed the 12-month programme in matriculation colleges can enroll in local universities. However, in the matriculation system, only 10 per cent of places are open to non-bumiputera students.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of rosemary <b>or</b> <b>Chinese</b> mahogany, at levels of 500, 1000 and 1500 ppm, of the phenolic Compounds, on the quality of fresh chicken sausage stored at 4 degrees C for 14 days. The results showed that sausages with addition of <b>Chinese</b> mahogany <b>or</b> rosemary underwent less pH value reduction. The intense colour of <b>Chinese</b> mahogany <b>or</b> rosemary resulted in samples with lower L values and higher a values. Samples with more <b>Chinese</b> mahogany <b>or</b> rosemary added had higher total phenolic compounds. Lower TBA (thiobarbituric acid) and VBN (volatile basic nitrogen) values, and lower total plate counts were observed for the samples with <b>Chinese</b> mahogany <b>or</b> rosemary added. Samples with Chinese mahogany added had higher overall acceptance than had samples with rosemary added. Some volatile compounds, including alcohols, acids, esters, aldehydes, ethers and phenolic compounds, were isolated from the samples and identified. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R

By this time, however, the Walled City was virtually ruled by the organised crime syndicates known as triads.|$|E
5|$|Armour {{has been}} {{employed}} in battles in Japan since the Yayoi period. Some {{of the oldest}} extant items from the 4th to the 7th centuries were excavated from kofun and have been designated as archaeological National Treasures. These ancient armours were of two types: a tight fitting solid plate cuirass (tankō) and a skirted lamellar type (keikō), both believed {{to be based on}} <b>Chinese</b> <b>or</b> Korean prototypes. This list includes more recent pieces of armour, developed as result of a trend toward (lamellar) scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-Heian period (9th to 10th centuries). Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or steel parts, these armours had the advantage of being light, flexible, foldable and shock absorbent. They were generally lacquered to protect them from the humid climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century. A complete set consisted of a helmet, mask, neck guard, throat protector, breastplate with shoulder guards, sleeve armour, skirt, greaves, shoes and a pennant attached to the back.|$|E

5|$|Indonesia's 2000 census {{reported}} 2,411,503 citizens (1.20 {{percent of}} the total population) as ethnic Chinese. An additional 93,717 (0.05 percent) ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia were reported as foreign citizens, mostly those of the People's Republic of China and Republic of China, who {{may not be able to}} pay the cost of becoming an Indonesian citizen. Because the census employed the method of self-identification, those who refused to identify themselves as ethnic <b>Chinese,</b> <b>or</b> had assumed the identity of other ethnic groups, were recorded as non-Chinese. It is also likely that some did not identify themselves for fear of repercussions in the wake of anti-Chinese violence in 1998, as several census stated that there are around 6 to 7 millions Chinese living in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{in the age}} of Augustus (r. 27 BC – 14 AD), {{the ancient}} Romans, {{including}} authors such as Pliny the Elder, mentioned contacts with the Seres, who they identified as the producers of silk from distant East Asia and could have been the <b>Chinese</b> <b>or</b> even any number of middlemen of various ethnic backgrounds along the Silk Road of Central Asia and Northwest China. The Eastern-Han era Chinese general Ban Chao, Protector General of the Western Regions, explored Central Asia and in 97 AD dispatched his envoys Gan Ying to Daqin (i.e. the Roman Empire). Gan was dissuaded by Parthian authorities to venture further than the Persian Gulf, although he wrote a detailed report about the Roman Empire, its cities, postal network, and consular system of government, and presented this to the Han court. Subsequently, there were a series of Roman embassies in China lasting from the 2nd to 3rd centuries AD, as recorded in Chinese sources. In 166 AD the Book of Later Han records that Romans reached China from the maritime south and presented gifts to the court of Emperor Huan of Han (r. 146–168 AD), claiming they represented Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (Andun 安敦) (r. 161–180 AD). Historian Rafe de Crespigny speculates that they were Roman merchants instead of official diplomats.|$|E

5|$|Writing was {{introduced}} from Korea to Japan around 400 AD (in {{the form of}} Chinese books), with work done in Chinese by immigrant scribes from the mainland. Literacy remained at an extremely marginal level in the 5th and 6th centuries, but during the 7th century {{a small number of}} Japanese scholar-aristocrats such as Prince Shōtoku began to write in Chinese for official purposes and in order to promote Buddhism. By the late 7th century, reading and writing had {{become an integral part of}} life of some sections of the ruling and intellectual classes, particularly in government and religion. The earliest extant large-scale works compiled in Japan are the historical chronicles Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720). Other early Japanese works from the Nara period include biographies of Prince Shōtoku, cultural and geographical records (fudoki) and the Man'yōshū, the first anthology of Japanese poetry. Necessarily all of these works were either written in <b>Chinese</b> <b>or</b> in a hybrid Japanese-Chinese style and were modeled on Chinese prototypes. The development of a distinct Japanese script (kana) in the 9th century was the starting point of the classical age of Japanese literature and led to a number of new, uniquely Japanese genres of literature, such as tales (monogatari) or diaries (nikki). Because of the strong interest and support in literature of the Heian court, writing activities flourished particularly in the 10th and 11th centuries.|$|E
