40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the hepatoprotective effects of the <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica</b> <b>extract</b> in carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury in rats. Sprague Dawley rats were treated with alcohol extract of Centella asiatica orally in two doses (20 and 40 mg/kg/day) for 3 mo along with intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride (1 ml/kg). Biochemical parameters such as serum total protein, albumin and marker enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase) were estimated {{both before and after the}} experiment. Histopathological studies of liver were also carried out to confirm the biochemical changes. Carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxic effects were evident by a significant (p < 0. 05) increase in the serum marker enzymes and a decrease in the total serum protein and albumin. Administration of extract of Centella asiatica effectively inhibited these changes in a dose-dependent manner; maximum effect was with 40 mg/kg.

40|$|Background Stress {{is one of}} {{the factors}} that cause {{apoptosis}} in neuronal cells. <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica</b> has a neuroprotective effect that can inhibit apoptosis. This study aimed to examine the effect of <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica</b> ethanol <b>extract</b> on B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl- 2) protein expression in the prefrontal cortex of rats. Methods An experimental study was conducted on 34 brain tissue samples from male Sprague Dawley rats exposed to chronic restraint stress for 21 days. The samples were taken from following groups: non-stress group K, negative control group P 1 (stress + arabic gum powder), P 2 (stress + C. asiatica at 150 mg/kgBW), P 3 (stress + C. asiatica at 300 mg/kg BW), P 4 (stress + C. asiatica at 600 mg/kg body weight) and positive control group P 5 (stress + fluoxetine at 10 mg/kgBW). The samples were made into sections that were stained immunohistochemically using Bcl- 2 antibody to determine the percentage of cells expressing Bcl- 2.

40|$|Introduction: Stress cause {{changes in}} the {{structure}} and function of the prefrontal cortex.

Methods: This study was a laboratory experimental using posttest only control group design. The study used 25 pieces of stored biological material sample in the form of rat brain tissue paraffin blocks. These brain tissues came from 25 rats that were divided into groups of P 1, P 2, P 3, P 4 and P 5. P 1 group treated with restraint stress. Group P 2, P 3 and P 4 were subjected to restraint stress and <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica</b> ethanolic <b>extract</b> with therapeutic dose of 150, 300 and 600 mg/kg/day.

40|$|Background: Striae gravidarum (SG) are atrophic linear scars that {{represent}} {{one of the}} most common connective tissue changes during pregnancy. SG can cause emotional and psychological distress for many women. Research on risk factors, prevention, and management of SG has been often inconclusive. Methods: We conducted a literature search using textbooks, PubMed, and Medline databases to assess research performed on the risk factors, prevention, and management of SG. The search included the following key words: striae gravidarum, pregnancy stretch marks, and pregnancy stretch. We also reviewed citations within articles to identify relevant sources. Results: Younger age, maternal and family history of SG, increased pre-pregnancy and pre-delivery weight, and increased birth weight were the most significant risk factors identified for SG. Although few studies have confirmed effective prevention methods, <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica</b> <b>extract,</b> hyaluronic acid, and daily massages showed some promise. Treatment for general striae has greatly improved over the last few years. Topical tretinoin ≥ 0. 05 % has demonstrated up to 47 % improvement of SG and non-ablative fractional lasers have consistently demonstrated 50 to 75 % improvement in treated lesions of striae distensae.

However, some topical hydrating products could have negative effects on skin barrier function. In addition, hydrating effects of moisturizers are not commonly evaluated up to 24  hours after a single application. Hyaluronic acid (HA) and glycerin are very well-known substances able to improve skin hydration. <b>Centella</b> <b>asiatica</b> <b>extract</b> (CAE) could exert lenitive, anti-inflammatory and reepithelialization actions. Furthermore, CAE could inhibit hyaluronidase enzyme activity, therefore prolonging the effect of HA. A fluid containing HA 1 %, glycerin 5 % and stem cells CAE has been recently developed (Jaluronius CS [JCS] fluid). Study aim: To evaluate and compare the 24 -hour effects of JCS fluid on skin hydration and on transepidermal water loss (TEWL) in healthy subjects {{in comparison with the}} control site. Subjects and methods: Twenty healthy women, mean age 40  years, were enrolled in an intra-subject (right vs left), randomized, assessor-blinded, controlled, 1 -day trial. The primary end points were the skin hydration and TEWL, evaluated at the volar surface of the forearm and in standardized conditions (temperature- and humidity-controlled room: 23 °C and 30 % of humidity) using a corneometer and a vapometer device at baseline, 1, 8 and 24  hours after JCS fluid application. Measurements were performed by an operator blinded for the treatments. Results: Skin hydration after 24  hours was significantly higher (P= 0. 001; Mann–Whitney U test) in the JCS-treated area in comparison with the control site. JCS induced a significant (P= 0. 0001) increase in skin hydration at each evaluation time (+ 59 % after 1  hour, + 48 % after 8  hours and + 29 % after 24  hours) in comparison with both baseline (P= 0. 0001) and non-treated control site (P= 0. 001). TEWL after 24  hours was significantly lower (P= 0. 049; Mann–Whitney U test) in the JCS-treated area in comparison with the control site (13 ± 4  arbitrary units [AU] vs 16 ± 6  AU). JCS fluid significantly reduced post-stripping TEWL in comparison with baseline after 1, 8 and 24  hours (– 52 %, – 32 % and – 48 %, respectively). In the control site, TEWL was not reduced in comparison with baseline values at each time point’s evaluation. Conclusion: A single application of JCS significantly improves skin hydration for up to 24  hours {{at the same time as}} improving skin barrier function.

The levels of nitrite and nitrate (NOX -), the stable end-products of nitric oxide (NO), in the gastric ulcer tissues were also decreased. N-[3 -(aminomethyl) benzyl]acetamidine (1400 W), a highly selective inhibitor of iNOS, was found to produce similar but more potent inhibition on iNOS activity at a dose of 0. 1 mg/kg.

The extracts were then measured for their phenolic contents using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Asiaticoside and madecassoside were determined using HPLC. Antioxidant activity was measured using the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DHPP) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. Anti-inflammatory activities were determined by the ability of the extracts to inhibit the inflammatory pathway enzyme, COX- 1 and COX- 2 as well as their ability to protect fibroblasts against 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) -induced production of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). Results showed that the level of phenolic constituents, asiaticoside and madecassoside were highest in the ethanol, followed by methanol and then aqueous extracts (17. 76 g/ 100 g, 15. 52 g/ 100 g, 13. 16 g/ 100 g for phenolics, 42. 86 mg/g, 36. 37 mg/g, 2. 82 mg/g for asiaticoside and 18. 66 mg/g, 15. 87 mg/g, 3. 75 mg/g for madecassoside respectively.

Objective: The present study is aimed to understand the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of C. asiatica and C. crista leaf extracts. Materials and Methods: Phenolic acid composition of the aqueous extracts of C. crista and C. asiatica were separated on a reverse phase C 18 column (4. 6 x 250 mm) using HPLC system. Antioxidant properties of the leaf extracts were determined by 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay and the reducing potential assay. The anti-inflammatory activities of aqueous extracts of C. crista and C. asiatica were studied using 5 -lipoxygenase assay. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) were isolated from blood by Ficoll-Histopaque density gradient followed by hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes. Results: Gallic, protocatechuic, gentisic, chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids were the phenolic acids identified in C. crista and C. <b>asiatica</b> leaf aqueous <b>extracts.</b> However, gallic acid and ferulic acid contents were much higher in C. crista compared to C. <b>asiatica.</b> Leaf <b>extracts</b> of C. <b>asiatica</b> and C. crista exhibited antioxidant properties and inhibited 5 -lipoxygenase (anti-inflammatory) in a dose dependent manner.
