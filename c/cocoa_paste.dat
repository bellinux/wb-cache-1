40|$|The known {{confectionery}} {{spreadable cream}} product category includes well-known <b>cocoa</b> - hazelnut <b>pastes</b> {{as well as}} peanut butter, products that became very popular in the last decades due to their pleasant taste and ease of eating. However, health constraints appeared both hazelnut and peanut are food allergens, while cocoa excites central nervous system (CNS) and on everyday consumption causes dependence. The aim of this work was to characterize the aroma and sensory of an innovative product that belongs to the same confectionery spreadable cream product category. Six spreadable cream prototypes were produced by using sugar, roasted sunflower kernel, carob or cocoa powder, palm or coconut fat and, lecithin. The obtained samples were firstly analyzed by using the nine point hedonic scale test. The volatile compounds profile analysis (“In Tube Extraction” - GC-MS) {{was performed on the}} best samples (in terms of sensory) containing cocoa or carob powder, as well as a control. The main volatile compound of all three samples was pinene (42 - 51 %) which is a characteristic flavor of turpentine, wood. Acetophenone instead (20 - 25 %) gives flavors of almond, floral, sweetish. Benzaldehyde (8. 11 - 9. 73 %) is characteristic for almond flavor with hints of caramel. The study revealed that the analyzed spreadable creams have similar volatile profiles, even if carob and cocoa powder showed different volatile compounds profiles, with the major compound for both being Propanoic acid, 2 -methyl. Thus, with similar taste to cocoa sample, carob-sunflower spreadable cream is an alternative that not include ingredients with allergic potential or CNS stimulants.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Geographically and climatically, the Côte d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) {{consists}} {{of at least}} three major zones. Low-lying land and lagoons with an equatorial tropical climate are found in the southern zone adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean. Tropical forest zone lies north of the lagoonal zone, and a wooded savanna zone with sparse vegetation and dry climate exists in the north of the country. The economy of Côte d’Ivoire is largely export-driven. The main exports are agrarian and forestry products, specifically cocoa, coffee, rubber-based latex, and timber. Agriculture accounts for approximately 26 % of Côte d’Ivoire’s GDP and an estimated 70 % of the country’s export earnings. Roughly 70 % of the labour force is involved in the agricultural sector. The main food crops are yams, cassava, plantains, rice and maize. Other crops include sugar cane, and export commodities such as cocoa beans, <b>cocoa</b> <b>paste,</b> coffee, cotton and pineapple. So far, the mining industry plays only a minor {{role in the development of}} the Côte d’Ivoire. Mineral exploration has focused on gold and lateritic nickel and relatively small amounts of oil were produced from offshore sources between 1978 and 1988. Recent exploration has confirmed the existence of additional oil and natural gas resources offshore. Geological outline The oldest rocks of Côte d’Ivoire are part of the Archean West Africa craton and occur in the west of the country. Undifferentiated granites and gneisses as well as Paleoproterozoic north-northeast striking rock sequences of the Birimian with predominantly metasediments (conglomerates, sandstones and shales) and subordinate metavolcanics (Wright et al. 1985) underlie most of the country. No Neoproterozoic rocks or Paleozoic rocks occur in Côte d’Ivoire. Sandy-clayey sediments of the Cretaceous and Quaternary were deposited along a narrow, east- west striking coastal strip, the Ivory Coast Basin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Ghana’s cocoa {{industry from}} the innovation systems perspective. Cocoa {{is the major}} cash crop of Ghana. Its importance is {{not only in the}} contribution of about 25 % annually of the total foreign exchange earnings but also on account of being the source of livelihoods for many rural farmers and the related actors in the value chain. The critical actors in the innovation system are the farmers, the researchers, the buyers, the transporters, public officers, consumers and the policy makers. By the roles and functions they perform, they impact on the dynamics of the cocoa industry. The paper describes the trends in cocoa production and processing and highlights the key characteristics and implications. It discusses the policy reforms in the cocoa industry and the major drivers of the reforms. The Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) {{is one of the biggest}} public institutions in Ghana and its subsidiaries are major actors in the production process of cocoa for export. The key reforms in the policies governing the industry were the dissolution of the monopoly of Produce Buying Company and the deregulation of cocoa purchasing to allow Licensed Buying Companies (LBCs) to enter the business in 1992 / 93 crop season. There was also the dismantling and re-organization of the Cocoa Services Division into two separate units—the Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus Disease Control Unit (CSSVDCU) and the Seed Production Unit (SPU). The processing of cocoa into cocoa butter, <b>cocoa</b> <b>paste</b> and confectioneries is an important component of the value chain especially with the national goal of processing 50 % of cocoa before export. The paper discusses policy implementation in the cocoa industry underscoring the successes and failures. It highlights lessons for other primary commodity producing countries especially those whose development contexts are similar to Ghana’s...|$|E
40|$|Although the EU imports raw {{materials}} from developing countries with zero or low tariffs, tariffs increase {{going up the}} value chain, according to a USDA GAIN Report. The reality of this tariff escalation, it maintains, citing the cases of rice and cocoa, is not compatible with the EU's proclaimed development objectives. Taking the example of rice, which is only included in the EBA to a limited degree until 2009, there is a 21 % increase in tariffs for husked rice versus paddy (rough) rice, and a 57 % increase if the rice is milled or semi-milled. This regime effectively limits semi-milled and milled rice imports into the EU to less than 20 % of total rice imports. The paper {{points out that in}} terms of rice imports from ACP countries the EU earns over € 10 million per annum in tariffs. What is more important is that it thereby inhibits the development of rice processing in ACP countries, with EU firms capturing the marketing margins on rice processing. 96 % of EU rice exports are of semi-milled or milled rice, and 45 % of the total go back to developing countries with the benefit of export refunds. With regard to cocoa the report notes a particular tariff peak on chocolate, arising partly from tariff escalation and partly from the supplementary duty charged, which is based on the sugar content of the chocolate. EBA countries (39 of which are also ACP) face no tariff escalation, but non-LDC ACP countries face a 12. 9 % duty, plus this supplementary sugar duty. The preferences extended to ACP countries have however encouraged more exports of <b>cocoa</b> <b>paste</b> and cocoa fat, butter and oil. Comment: The analysis contained in this report is based on the EU's standard GSP regime and {{does not take into account}} the EBA initiative established for least developed countries or the trade provisions of the Cotonou Agreement. It notes that duty-free access for rice is to be granted to LDC exporters by 2009, ending tariff escalation for these countries. However by that time, as a result of the implementation of rice-sector reforms, it is estimated that the European market price for rice will be 41 % below current levels. Such a market development would greatly undermine the value of the removal of tariff escalation. Although the EU imports {{raw materials}} from developing countries with zero or [...] ...|$|E
