25|$|Though {{small in}} terms of {{accommodation}} in comparison with modern boats with wider beams and greater headroom, the compact cabin of the Contessa resulted from the low, narrow-beamed design that emphasized rough weather handling and seaworthiness {{at the expense of}} <b>cabin</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{civilian}} production version, or Series 40, {{was slightly}} refined over the prototype, with more speed and a roomier cabin. North American then stretched the design by 3feet 2inches, providing greater <b>cabin</b> <b>space,</b> and marketed {{it as the}} Series 60, which was certificated in April 1967. The cabin was made taller for the Series 70 and General Electric CF700 turbofans were installed for the Series 75A (also branded as the Series 80).|$|E

50|$|In 2010, Zargodox (Pty) Ltd began {{a private}} {{initiative}} {{with the aim}} of growing tourism in the Hartbeespoort area, and purchased the old cableway. In collaboration with Swiss company Rowema AG, Zargodox invested time and expertise into rejuvenating the old cableway and bringing the area back to life.14 six-seater hi-tech cable cars, new galvanised cabling, touch-screen technology, and auto <b>cabin</b> <b>spacing</b> and conveyor programming technology was installed.|$|R
25|$|During {{the impact}} and short ground roll, the nose gear collapsed, the right main gear {{separated}} from the aircraft, penetrating the central fuel tank and <b>cabin</b> <b>space,</b> and the left main gear was pushed up through the wing. The aircraft {{came to rest on}} the threshold markings {{at the start of the}} runway. A significant amount of fuel leaked, but there was no fire. Four crew members and eight passengers received minor injuries, and one passenger received serious injuries (concussion and a broken leg).|$|E
25|$|The Mi-26 was {{designed}} to replace earlier Mi-6 and Mi-12 heavy lift helicopters and act as a heavy-lift helicopter for military and civil use, having twice the <b>cabin</b> <b>space</b> and payload of the Mi-6, then the world's largest and fastest production helicopter. The {{primary purpose of the}} Mi-26 was to transport military equipment such as 13 metric ton (29,000lb) amphibious armored personnel carriers and mobile ballistic missiles to remote locations after delivery by military transport aircraft such as the Antonov An-22 or Ilyushin Il-76.|$|E
25|$|In 1905 the Galilee was {{chartered}} by the Carnegie Institution's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism to {{be converted}} into a magnetic observatory. The amount of magnetic materials on the ship {{was reduced to a}} minimum. The steel rigging was replaced by hemp ropes and a new observation bridge was constructed to lift the observation point as far as possible above the remaining iron parts of the ship, principally bolts in the vessel's sides. Additional <b>cabin</b> <b>space</b> was also provided to accommodate the scientists. Although the converted Galilee had magnetic constants lower than any equivalent ship at the time, corrections were still required to take account of the remaining magnetic material.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{delivery}} of new Star class ships for the Helsinki-Travemünde service in 2006 and 2007 MS Finntrader and MS Finnpartner were taken off the Finland-Germany service and rebuilt at Remontowa, Poland with bow gates and additional <b>cabin</b> <b>spaces.</b> After the refit, on 19 February 2007, the Finntrader began service on Finnlines' Malmö-Travemünde route. At {{the same time the}} ship's homeport was changed from Helsinki to Malmö and her original cream/green colour scheme was changed to Finnlines' while/blue. The Finnpartner was rebuilt with similar modifications and joined the Finntrader on the Malmö-Travemünde service in July 2007.|$|R
25|$|Originally {{designated}} AS365 N4, the EC155 {{was developed}} from the Eurocopter AS365 N3 Dauphin 2 {{with the aim of}} significantly increasing the <b>cabin</b> <b>space</b> of the Dauphin. Development began in September 1996 with the helicopter officially announced by Eurocopter at the Paris Air Show in June 1997. The first EC155 helicopter, a modified Dauphin airframe, made its maiden flight at Marignane on 17 June 1997 and the first pre-production EC155 B flew on 11 March 1998. The aircraft received safety certification by the French & German Civil Aviation Authorities on 11 December 1998 and went into production soon after, with a price tag of US$7–8million depending on installed equipment.|$|E
25|$|The premise for {{the coast}} guard was that its largest {{offshore}} patrol vessels, the Nordkapp-class, would be equipped with helicopters. A 1976 commission considered the options and concluded that three rotorcraft met the criteria: the Westland Lynx, the Sikorsky S-76 and the Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk. It recommended the Seahawk, citing its supreme range, de-icing and <b>cabin</b> <b>space.</b> It was also suitable as to provide a unified helicopter fleet for the Air Force. The Navy preferred the Lynx, emphasizing its low cost, manoeuvrability, that most North Sea-countries were purchasing it and that it already was in British service. The Seahawk would not be operational until 1984. Parliament approved the purchase of six units in 1978.|$|E
500|$|Launched at the June 2017 Paris Air Show, Airbus {{offers an}} A380plus {{enhanced}} version with 13% lower costs per seat, featuring up to 80 more seats through {{better use of}} <b>cabin</b> <b>space,</b> split scimitar winglets and wing refinements allowing a 4% fuel economy improvement and longer aircraft maintenance intervals with less downtime. [...] Its maximum takeoff weight is increased by [...] to , allowing it to carry more passengers over the same 8,200 nmi range or increase the range by 300 nm. Emirates could order 20 aircraft at the November Dubai Air Show.|$|E
50|$|When built, {{the ship}} had a gross tonnage of 19,089 but it was {{stretched}} to its present size by Fred Olsen Lines in 2009, the new middle section containing extra <b>cabins,</b> lounge <b>space</b> and swimming pools.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was powered by three Fiat A.60 inline piston engines, with one {{mounted on the}} fuselage nose {{and the other two}} in wing-mounted nacelles. Variants were also produced with other engine installations. The enclosed <b>cabin</b> had <b>space</b> for six passengers.|$|R
50|$|With a wide {{comfortable}} <b>cabin</b> offering <b>space</b> {{for three}} people and using uncomplicated technology the Borgward 611 won {{friends in the}} press and in the market place.

500|$|Nepal Airlines {{ordered the}} 757-200M {{to fulfill a}} {{requirement}} for an aircraft that could carry mixed passenger and freight loads, and operate out of Tribhuvan International Airport, with its [...] elevation, {{in the foothills of}} the Himalayas. Patterned after convertible variants of the 737 and 747, the 757-200M can carry two to four cargo pallets on its main deck, along with 123 to 148 passengers in the remaining <b>cabin</b> <b>space.</b> Nepal Airlines' 757-200M, which features Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4 engines and an increased MTOW of , was the only production example ordered.|$|E
500|$|As the British {{magazine}} What Car? opined, the Tagora [...] "has such {{a complete}} blandness of style as to disqualify it instantly {{in a market}} where character and status count for so much." [...] The design of the Tagora was focused on practicality, providing exceptional <b>cabin</b> <b>space</b> {{at the expense of}} style. The steep windscreen formed a quite strange angle with the relatively short, wedge-shaped bonnet. The car was wider and taller than most of its competitors, and buyers were unaccustomed to such proportions. The PSA-sourced axles had very narrow tracks relative to the width of the body, which provided an awkward look, especially at the rear. Nor did the plain, plastic dashboard stir enthusiasm among reviewers and prospective customers.|$|E
500|$|The plane bent upon {{landing at}} Juanda International Airport, with the {{fuselage}} breaking {{in the middle}} of the passenger section. The landing was particularly hard, with baggage being ejected from cabin lockers into the <b>cabin</b> <b>space.</b> The tail section of the plane was bent down compared to the rest of the plane. Subsequent flights to the airport were diverted to alternate airports. Adam Air's fleet of Boeing 737-300s were grounded for safety inspections in the interim. Immediately after the accident, Adam Air repainted the aircraft, covering the original orange livery with a plain white exterior. This is legally permissible, so long as no evidence is destroyed. Also in the immediate aftermath, a large number of passengers cancelled their flights with Adam Air, saying they had [...] "lost faith" [...] in the airline. They were all refunded in full.|$|E
40|$|Decreased {{resistance}} to infections initiated by respiratory challenge with Klebsiella pneumoniae or influenza virus {{was observed in}} mice maintained in a simulated <b>space</b> <b>cabin</b> environment represented by 98 % oxygen atmosphere and 27, 000 ft altitude (5 psi). The reduced resistance was manifested by increased mortality rates as compared to those seen in mice maintained at ground level condition. However, an adaptation to the stress appeared {{to be present in}} mice exposed to the <b>space</b> <b>cabin</b> environment for extended time period, i. e. 36 days, and then challenged with the influenza virus. Reduced resistance was not observed when Salmonella typhimurium was used as the challenge agent. Histopathologic examination of lungs of mice indicated that the severity of damage appeared {{to be related to the}} duration of exposure to the simulated <b>space</b> <b>cabin</b> environment...|$|R
40|$|Four years ago, Argonide Corporation, {{a company}} {{focused on the}} research, production, and {{marketing}} of specialty nano materials, was seeking to develop applications for its NanoCeram[R] fibers. Only 2 nanometers in diameter, these nano aluminum oxide fibers possessed unusual bio-adhesive properties. When formulated into a filter material, the electropositive fibers attracted and retained electro-negative particles such as bacteria and viruses in water-based solutions. This technology caught the interest of NASA as a possible solution for improved water filtration in <b>space</b> <b>cabins.</b> NASA's Johnson <b>Space</b> Center awarded Sanford, Florida-based Argonide a Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract to determine the feasibility of using the company's filter for purifying recycled <b>space</b> <b>cabin</b> water. Since viruses and bacteria can be carried aboard <b>space</b> <b>cabins</b> by <b>space</b> crews, the ability to detect and remove these harmful substances is a concern for NASA. The Space Agency also desired an improved filter to polish the effluent from condensed and waste water, producing potable drinking water. During its Phase I partnership with NASA, Argonide developed a laboratory-size filter capable of removing greater than 99. 9999 percent of bacteria and viruses from water at flow rates more than 200 times faster than virus-rated membranes that remove particles by sieving. Since the new filter s pore size is rather large compared to other membranes, it is also less susceptible to clogging by small particles. In September 2002, Argonide began a Phase II SBIR project with Johnson to develop a full-size cartridge capable of serving a full space crew. This effort, which is still ongoing, enabled the company to demonstrate that its filter media is an efficient absorbent for DNA and RNA...|$|R
50|$|In 1985, Cleveland-Cliffs {{sold its}} two {{remaining}} operating steamers to Rouge Steel Company, and gradually sold off its idle vessels until only William G. Mather remained, laid up in Toledo, Ohio {{where she had}} been since 1980. On 10 December 1987, Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc. donated the steamer William G. Mather to the Great Lakes Historical Society to be restored and preserved as a museum ship and floating maritime museum. After she was brought to Cleveland in October 1988 and funding was acquired from local foundations, corporations, and individuals, restoration began. Fire damage to William G. Mathers galley and after <b>cabin</b> <b>spaces</b> required a major restoration effort. All over the vessel, most of the work was supplied by volunteers who repaired, cleaned, chipped, painted, and polished brass in order to restore William G. Mathers former elegance. In October 1990, she was moved to her permanent berth at the East Ninth Street Pier on Cleveland's North Coast Harbor.|$|R
500|$|One of {{the last}} 727 vestiges, the T-tail, was dropped in mid-1979 {{in favor of a}} {{conventional}} tail. This avoided the risk of an aerodynamic condition known as a deep stall, and allowed for more passengers to be carried in a less tapered rear fuselage. At [...] in length, the [...] was [...] longer than the , and with a greater proportion of its internal volume devoted to <b>cabin</b> <b>space,</b> seating was available for 239 passengers, or 50 more than its predecessor. The fuselage cross-section, whose upper lobe was common to the 707 and 737, was the only major structural feature to be retained from the 727. This was mainly to reduce drag, and while a wider fuselage had been considered, Boeing's market research found low cargo capacity needs and reduced passenger preference for wide-body aircraft on short-haul routes.|$|E

50|$|The {{area around}} the hotel has been {{designated}} as an historic railroad district. Many of the building relate to the rail lines that still exist {{in front of the}} hotel. To the west of the hotel is a bunkhouse that was used by hotel staff and train crews. Just north of the bunkhouse is a small three-room cabin that was typical of several <b>cabins</b> <b>spaced</b> around the property. The architectural details of the hotel, bunkhouse, and cabin indicate that all were built at the same time. Across the road from the bunkhouse is the house of the Section Master who presided over a section of the railroad. This house was bought from the Southern Pacific Railroad in the 1940s. The Kingsland Depot was {{directly in front of the}} hotel between the main line and the sidetrack that still exist. In the field in front of the hotel, which is now the parking lot of the Grand Central Cafe and Club Car Bar, was a large wooden pavilion used for dances and community gatherings.|$|R
