5|$|Abi invites Dot to Christmas in Exeter but Dot insists she {{has plans}} of her own. The {{launderette}} closes on Christmas Eve, but everyone is {{too busy to}} visit her. She finds a Christmas mixtape recorded by her now-deceased friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), and takes in a stray cat, which she eventually names Dave. She spends Christmas Day alone, but when Patrick realises she has not gone to Exeter, he invites her to The Queen Victoria pub where everyone is celebrating Christmas, and her neighbours present her with the gift of a washing machine. When Ronnie, the wife of Dot's former stepson, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), and her sister Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), mother of one of Jack's children, both die, Dot tells the <b>children</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are in heaven, helping them to understand after Jack struggles to find an appropriate way to tell them. When Jack is unable to take Dot to the garden centre, she decides to drive herself with her great-grandson, Matthew Mitchell Cotton, but drives through a no entry sign into oncoming traffic and {{ends up in the}} verge. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns {{but it turns out that}} he's only back for his son. Dot's step granddaughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) lives with her for a while but moves out with Dot's blessing. Dot is surprised when Charlie returns but is left upset when Charlie leaves to go back to Ireland with Mathew, also upsetting Jack. Dot and Jack are unaware this is part of Max Branning's (Jake Wood) evil revenge for his false imprisonment.|$|E

Differential fecundity and assortive matching in marriage are necessary for parents to invest {{differently in}} the skills of their sons and daughters. Unlike the Trivers Willard hypothesis, better endowed parents do not necessarily invest relatively more on the survival of their sons relative to worse endowed parents. Parents invest more on the health of the <b>child</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> value higher. They do not necessarily invest more on the skills of the <b>child</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> value higher.

These enquiries would culminate in a search warrant being issued to excavate the Wests' garden in February 1994.|$|E

25|$|At the end {{the premiere}} episode of the program's sixth season, it was {{revealed}} that Amita has accepted Charlie's proposal. The issue was skirted throughout the episode, as the two were waiting until Amita officially received permission from her parents. He and Amita discuss the number of <b>children</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> want to have, and they both decide that they may need to participate in the Big Brother/Big Sister program for some practical experience before having children. He and Amita attempt to find a wedding date that is suited to their and their families' schedules; Alan suggests that they should take his and Margaret's anniversary date as Charlie and Amita's date. Charlie and Amita have since pushed the date forward as his academic fantasy has come to light, being a visiting professor at Cambridge University. In the season finale, after the wedding ceremony presided over by Larry, he is happy but worries about disconnecting with Don and offers to have the garage renovated into a guest house for his father. He toasts his friends and family and amazes at the prospect of staying in England with his wife.|$|E

500|$|Parents, meanwhile, give {{endlessly}} {{to their}} children; Goriot sacrifices everything for his daughters. Balzac refers {{to him in}} the novel as the [...] "Christ of paternity" [...] for his constant suffering on behalf of his <b>children.</b> <b>That</b> <b>they</b> abandon him, lost in their pursuit of social status, only adds to his misery. The end of the book contrasts Goriot's deathbed moments with a festive ball hosted by Madame de Beauséant– attended by his daughters, as well as Rastignac– suggesting a fundamental schism between society and the family.|$|E

500|$|The {{subject was}} {{inspired}} by Mary Alice [...] "Allie" [...] Smith, an orphan living in the Riley home during her childhood. The poem contains four stanzas; the first introduces Annie and {{the second and third}} are stories she is telling to young children. Each story tells of a bad child who is snatched away by goblins {{as a result of his}} or her misbehavior. The underlying moral and warning is announced in the final stanza, telling <b>children</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should obey their parents and be kind to the unfortunate, lest they suffer the same fate.|$|E
500|$|Researchers have {{investigated}} whether {{the reliability of}} the reward affects one's ability to delay gratification. Reliability of the reward refers to how well the reward received matches what the person was expecting or promised in terms of quality and quantity. For example, researchers told <b>children</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would receive better art supplies if they waited. After the children successfully waited for the reward, better supplies could not be [...] "found" [...] and so they had to use the crayons and stickers that were in poor shape. Comparing these children to ones who received their promised rewards reliably revealed different results on subsequent Marshmallow tests measuring delayed gratification. Children who had learned that the researcher's promise was unreliable quickly succumbed to eating the marshmallow, waiting only an average of 3 minutes. Conversely, children who had learned that the researcher was reliable were able to wait an average of 12 minutes, with many of them waiting the full 15 minutes for the researcher to return in order to double the reward to two marshmallows.|$|E
500|$|The seminal {{research}} on delayed gratification – the now-famous [...] "marshmallow experiment" [...] – {{was conducted by}} Walter Mischel in the 1960s and 1970s at Stanford University. Mischel and his colleagues were interested in strategies that preschool children used to resist temptation. They presented four-year-olds with a marshmallow and told the <b>children</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had two options: (1) ring a bell at any point to summon the experimenter and eat the marshmallow, or (2) wait until the experimenter returned (about 15 minutes later), and earn two marshmallows. The message was: [...] "small reward now, bigger reward later." [...] Some children broke down and ate the marshmallow, whereas others were able to delay gratification and earn the coveted two marshmallows. In follow-up experiments, Mischel found that children were able to wait longer if they used certain [...] "cool" [...] distraction techniques (covering their eyes, hiding under the desk, singing songs, or imagining pretzels instead of the marshmallow in front of them), or if they changed the way they thought about the marshmallow (focusing on its similarity to a cotton ball, rather than on its gooey, delectable taste).|$|E

50|$|Because {{information}} on {{many aspects of}} the history of the CLR is either scant or absent, the recollections of people such as Mynett are of significance to the historical record.

2500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Heather's disappearance, Fred would occasionally jokingly threaten the <b>children</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would [...] "end up under the patio like Heather" [...] if they either misbehaved or divulged the mistreatment they endured to anyone outside the household.

2500|$|In foreign policy, Mussolini was {{pragmatic and}} opportunistic. At {{the center of}} his vision lay the dream to forge a new Roman Empire in Africa and the Balkans, vindicating the {{so-called}} [...] "mutilated victory" [...] of 1918 imposed by the [...] "plutodemocracies" [...] (Britain and France) that betrayed the Treaty of London and usurped the supposed [...] "natural right" [...] of Italy to achieve supremacy in the Mediterranean basin. However, in the 1920s, given Germany's weakness, post-war reconstruction problems and the question of reparations, the situation of Europe was too unfavorable to advocate an openly revisionist approach to the Treaty of Versailles. In the 1920s, Italy's foreign policy was based on the traditional idea of Italy maintaining [...] "equidistant" [...] stance from all the major powers in order to exercise [...] "determinant weight", which by whatever power Italy chose to align with would decisively change {{the balance of power in}} Europe, and the price of such an alignment would be support for Italian ambitions in Europe and/or Africa. In the meantime, since for Mussolini demography was destiny, he carried out relentless natalist policies designed to increase the birthrate; for example, in 1924 making advocating or giving information about contraception a criminal offense, and in 1926 ordering every Italian woman to double the number of <b>children</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were willing to bear. For Mussolini, Italy's current population of 40 million was insufficient to fight a major war, and he needed to increase the population to at least 60 million Italians before he would be ready for war.|$|E

2500|$|Germany's Left Party {{brought up}} the {{discussion}} about affirmative action. According to Stefan Zillich, quotas should be [...] "a possibility" [...] to help working class children who did not {{do well in school}} gain access to a Gymnasium. Headmasters of Gymnasien have objected, saying that this type of policy would [...] "be a disservice" [...] to poor <b>children,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{would not be able to}} academically keep up with their classmates and that they would not feel welcome at a Gymnasium. Wolfgang Harnischfeger, headmaster of a well known Berlin Gymnasium, stated: [...] "It can be noticed in children as young as kindergarten-age, that children take after their parents. They emulate their language, their way of dressing, their way of spending their freetime. Children from Neukölln (a poor neighbourhood) would not feel good about themselves if they had to attend that type of school that mainly serves pupils from social classes different from their own. They will not be able to integrate. Every field-day, every school party will show that very soon." [...] He also said that [...] "this kind of policy would weaken the Gymnasium" [...] and that this would be dangerous, because [...] "German society could not afford to do without the truly educated adults the Gymnasium produces". Stefan Zillich has answered to this, saying that [...] "German society can not afford having only so few adults who were truly educated". While affirmative action laws were not passed (status: January 2010) sought after schools have been guaranteed the right to employ their own quotas since the 1970s.|$|E
