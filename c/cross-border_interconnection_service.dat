40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} effects of the future European power {{generation}} system with strict CO 2 emission reduction targets on the planning of <b>cross-border</b> <b>interconnection</b> lines. Results from a techno-economic energy systems model have been used as input to this work, regarding the development of the European power generation system until the year 2050, meeting the EU 2020 CO 2 target and a 85 % emissions reduction until the year 2050. A simplified UCTE power system model was developed in order to analyze how the <b>cross-border</b> <b>interconnections</b> in continental Europe are affected by the generation plans using an iterative method. The paper also attempts to identify the congestion points and proposes solutions based on nodal price modeling. A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is used to evaluate the appropriate transmission planning strategy, with the costs being the long-term investment costs and the benefits being both the avoided environmental costs and the total congestion costs. The effects of new investments on the nodal prices are also studied. The results show that the profitability of the investments is influenced by the available production mix and the forecasted CO 2 prices. The avoided congestion costs participate rather insignificantly in the CBA, which means that congestions are not relieved, showing that many interconnections are insufficient for nodal pricing market structure...|$|R

Thus, it is expected that a high-priced area such as Italy could greatly benefit from the introduction of this mechanism.

40|$|Thanks {{to growing}} {{environmental}} concerns, renewable energies take a higher andhigher share of electricity generating portfolios. In Germany particularly, the installedcapacity {{of wind and}} solar plants has increased continuously {{for the past ten}} years. Given theprinciple of the merit-order dispatch, a greater use of wind and solar power allows theelectricity spot prices to drop significantly. However, wind and sun are both intermittentresources, and this leaves great room for uncertainties on prices. As a consequence, pricesbecome much more dependent on the weather conditions and show greater volatilities,making hedging much more difficult. At the same time, the mechanism of market coupling inthe Central West Europe (France, Germany, Benelux) goes toward a harmonization of prices. As such, the <b>cross-border</b> <b>interconnections</b> play a decisive role in the electricity pricing. This paper deals with the actual influence of the interconnections between France andGermany on electricity spot prices when renewable energies are added to the energy mix. Amodel of a French-German market is made in order to see the impact of an increasingpenetration of renewable energies on spot prices. The wind and solar generations aremodelled using artificial neural networks, ANN. Multiple linear regression is employed tomodel the French and German loads. The <b>cross-border</b> <b>interconnections</b> are modelled basedon the capacity allocations published by RTE (the national French grid operator) and finallythe French and German prices are modelled with a GARCH process to study the volatilities. The study is made for three different scenarios: the reference scenario, with a penetration ofrenewable energies as seen in 2012, a 2020 scenario, with a penetration of renewable energiesas predicted in 2012, and a 2020 scenario with increased interconnection capacities betweenFrance and Germany. Running the models shows that a higher penetration of renewable energies lowers spotprices in average, but introduces price spikes that did not exist beforehand. On short periodsof observation, the volatility seems to decrease, but on longer periods, the spikes increase thevolatility. Also, increasing the interconnection capacities does make the prices converge, butto a certain extent only. Finding fitting hedging strategies becomes more delicate when prices vary with suchuncertainty. The study could be more developed (by extending it to the whole Europeancontinent) {{in order to get a}} more accurate vision of how energy markets will look like in a fewyears. However, it must be understood that the future scenarios depend on many variablefactors, and no mathematical model is able to capture all those factors accurately...|$|R

Theoretical unconstrained portfolios show that countries (Spain and Denmark) with the best wind resource or whose size contributes to smoothing out the country output variability dominate optimal portfolios.

The thesis aims to provide a model for interconnection that may be used to deal with the present market dominance in the Chinese <b>interconnection</b> <b>service</b> market. In order to achieve this aim, the thesis identifies the weaknesses in the Chinese interconnection regulations which may be utilized by the incumbent carrier to impede fair competition in the <b>interconnection</b> <b>service</b> market by comparing the Chinese regulations, and the relevant regulations in the WTO Reference Paper and the relevant U.

40|$|The {{complementarity}} between electricity {{systems of}} {{the north and south}} Mediterranean basin along with the need for diversification of energy resources and optimisation of energy systems are among the reasons for greater electricity trade and cross-border integration in the region. However, development of <b>cross-border</b> <b>interconnection</b> in the Mediterranean basin requires a business model which provides incentives for investment and efficient operation, manages risks and uncertainties and facilitates coordinated planning and governance. We contend that, due to high perceived risk of investment, delivery of interconnection projects through the EU regulated model is less likely, or only possible at prohibitively high rate of returns. The merchant transmission initiative (MTI), on the other hand, is seen as an exception under the EU laws and can be approved only if the project meets a set of strict conditions. We, therefore, advocate a hybrid business model in which the main benefits of a merchant model are maintained within a regulated structure. We highlight the main components of the proposed business model and show how it addresses the key features of a viable business model in relation to incentives, risks and governance.
