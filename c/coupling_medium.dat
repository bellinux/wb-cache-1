The field emission current from a scanning tunneling microscope tip {{was used as the}} heating source. Various pulse voltages were applied to two types of CoNi/Pt multilayered films: one is strongly coupled with low coercivity, and the other is weakly coupled with high coercivity. Experimental results show that marks achieved in strongly <b>coupled</b> <b>medium</b> are larger than that in granular one. An external magnetic field was then applied to those marks. For weak fields (lower than the coercivity of the medium) the size of marks changes distinctly in the strongly <b>coupled</b> <b>medium</b> but not in the granular one.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{two-dimensional}} macroscale shear flows are susceptible to instabilities leading to macroscale vortical structures. The linear and nonlinear fate of such a macroscale flow in a strongly <b>coupled</b> <b>medium</b> is a fundamental problem. A popular example of a strongly <b>coupled</b> <b>medium</b> is a dusty plasma, often modelled as a Yukawa liquid. Recently, laboratory experiments and MD studies of shear flows in strongly coupled Yukawa liquids, indicated occurrence of strong molecular shear heating, which is found to reduce the coupling strength exponentially leading to destruction of macroscale vorticity. To understand the vortex dynamics of strongly coupled molecular fluids undergoing macroscale shear flows and molecular shear heating, MD simulation has been performed, which allows the macroscopic vortex dynamics to evolve while at the same time, "removes" the microscopically generated heat without using the velocity degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that by using a configurational thermostat in a novel way, the microscale heat generated by shear flow can be thermostatted out efficiently without compromising the large scale vortex dynamics. In present work, using MD simulations, a comparative study of shear flow evolution in Yukawa liquids in presence and absence of molecular or microscopic heating is presented for a prototype shear flow namely, Kolmogorov flow...|$|R

We derive spatial quantization equations, and calculate numerically energy levels of spatially quantized states of a transverse electron motion in the plane perpendicular to the NW axis, and electronic subbands developed due to a free longitudinal motion along the NW axis. Using explicit expressions for eigenfunctions of the electronic states, we also derive analytical expressions for matrix elements of optical transitions and study selection rules for interband absorption. Next we study a two-particle problem with a conventional long-range Coulomb interaction and an interparticle <b>coupling</b> via <b>medium</b> polarization.

A novel electrical model of the <b>coupling</b> <b>medium</b> that represents a well-known RLC circuit attributable to the coupling medium's intrinsic resistive, inductive, and capacitive properties is derived.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an {{increased}} interest in ultra wideband (UWB) microwave imaging systems as an important alternative for mammography and other techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging or ultra sound in breast cancer detection. The reason is that microwaves offer a safe and low cost option for patients screening in comparison with these alternatives [1, 2]. The feasibility of UWB microwave imaging relies on two fundamental properties: Firstly, tumours have higher water content and hence a higher dielectric constant compared with the normal breast tissues, which is mainly fat. Therefore, a strong scattering {{takes place at the}} boundary between the normal tissue and lesions. Secondly, microwave attenuation in normal breast tissue is less than 4. 5 dB/cm across an UW frequency band of 3. 1 to 10. 6 GHz. This value of attenuation permits the microwave imaging system to detect small size, early-stage tumours. In order to enhance the detection process for a given dynamic range of the breast radar, recent approaches to UWB microwave imaging tend to employ a <b>coupling</b> <b>medium</b> between an imaged object (the breast) and an illuminating device (an antenna). In this case, both the antenna and the breast are immersed in a <b>coupling</b> <b>medium.</b> The reflected/scattered signal is collected and analysed to get a three dimensional image of the object depending on its dielectric profile. The use of a <b>coupling</b> <b>medium</b> minimizes the reflection at the skin interface, thereby reducing the propagation loss, and thus increases the dynamic range and resolution of the imaging system. The reviewing of the literature related to this important topic shows that the researchers use a <b>coupling</b> <b>medium</b> with a dielectric constant which is either equal to that of the skin or the normal tissue [3 - 5]. Neither of these two choices addresses the question of the optimal characteristics of the <b>coupling</b> <b>medium.</b> In this paper, a theoretical analysis, supported by computer simulations, is conducted to work out the - - optimal characteristics of the <b>coupling</b> <b>medium...</b>|$|E

In such an inspection, {{the application of}} an automatic inspection system is desirable, because a manual inspection is difficult to accomplish perfectly and exactly due to its enormity, a so-called nondestructive inspection robot is then preferable.
