50|$|The {{volume of}} <b>countertrade</b> is growing. In 1972, it was {{estimated}} that <b>countertrade</b> was used by business and governments in 15 countries; in 1979, 27 countries; by the start of the 1990s, around 100 countries (Verzariu, 1992). A large part of <b>countertrade</b> has involved sales of military equipment (weaponry, vehicles and installations).|$|E
50|$|The ÖVP-FPÖ (later ÖVP-BZÖ) {{coalition}} had on 1 July 2003 {{entered into}} a contract for eighteen Eurofighter Typhoon interceptor aircraft to replace the obsolete Saab 35 Draken interceptor aircraft; one of the SPÖ's election promises in the 2006 election had been to renegotiate the contract, as the Eurofighter Typhoon was considered by many people (especially by supporters of the SPÖ and the Greens) as being too expensive and having unncessary offensive capabilities not necessary {{for the protection of}} the Austrian airspace. Following the election, SPÖ MP Norbert Darabos became defence minister; he did not succeed in cancelling the contract, as had been the SPÖ's goal (through using perceived illegalities and shadowy details in the contract and its associated <b>countertrades),</b> but only managed to reduce the number from eighteen to fifteen aircraft and to obtain cheaper second-hand aircraft instead of newly built ones. A report from the Austrian Court of Auditors published on 22 August 2008 stated that the claimed cost reduction of €370 million was incorrect and that at most €267 million had been saved in expenses. The Greens announced they would propose a motion of no confidence against Darabos, which the BZÖ immediately stated they would support; the ÖVP stated it might also support the motion. The FPÖ waited to see the precise content of the motion before deciding whether to support it or not; Darabos stated he believed the SPÖ might have to react and take measures against the ÖVP if it supported the motion of no confidence.|$|R
40|$|The {{horizontal}} {{integration of the}} energy market {{and the organization of}} transmission services remain two open issues in the restructured European electricity sector. The coupling of the French, Belgian and Dutch electricity markets (the trilateral market) in November 2006 was a real success. The extension of the system to Germany in November 2010 also proceeded smoothly and the intent is to continue with the same market architecture. But Market Coupling is based on a zonal system which has often failed in meshed grids. This may cast doubts on what will happen in the future when electricity demand picks up again and wind develops. The nodal system has generally been more successful than zonal architectures but its implementation is not currently foreseen in the EU. This paper analyzes versions of Market Coupling that differ by the organization of counter-trading. While underplayed in current discussions, counter-trading could become a key element of Market Coupling as its geographic coverage expands and wind penetrates. We simplify matters by assuming away strategic behavior between the energy and counter-trading markets and conduct the analysis on a stylized six node example taken from the literature. We simulate Market Coupling for different assumptions of zonal decomposition and coordination of Transmission System Operators (TSOs). We show that these assumptions matter: {{even in the absence of}} strategic behavior, Market Coupling can be quite vulnerable to the particular situation on hand; <b>countertrading</b> can work well or completely fail and it is not clear beforehand what will prevail. Our analysis relies on standard economic notions such as social welfare and Generalized Nash equilibrium, but the use of these notions is probably novel. The nodal organization is the reference first best scenario: different zonal decompositions and degrees of coordination are then studied with respect to this first best solution...|$|R

50|$|<b>Countertrade</b> means exchanging {{goods or}} {{services}} which are paid for, in whole or part, with other {{goods or services}}, rather than with money.

50|$|<b>Countertrade</b> {{transactions}} {{have been}} basically conducted among the former Soviet Union {{and its allies}} in the Eastern Europe {{and other parts of}} the world. The reason that these countries have allocated a big portion of their commerce to the <b>countertrade</b> attributed to insufficient hard currency. A significant proportion of international commerce, possibly as much as 25%, involves the barter of products for other products rather than for hard currency. <b>Countertrade</b> may range from a simple barter between two countries to a complex web of exchanges meeting the needs of all countries involved.|$|E
50|$|More than 80 {{countries}} nowadays regularly use {{or require}} <b>countertrade</b> exchanges.

The British Department of Trade and Industry has suggested 15%, while some scholars {{believe it to be}} closer to 30%, with east-west trade having been as high as 50% in some trading sectors of Eastern European and Third World Countries for some years.

(This is called [...] "double coincidence of wants".) But this is arguably too simplistic an interpretation of how markets operate in the real world.

5000|$|Financial risk {{management}} takes a new meaning {{when applied to}} companies operating internationally with many currencies as currency values can change abruptly and unexpectedly. [...] To combat the associated foreign exchange risks, companies have implemented many of the following tactics and strategies; First, multinational companies have to assess at the individual country and consolidated levels three kinds of foreign exchange exposure for various future time horizons, transactions exposure, accounting exposure, and economic exposure. [...] Once a company has these measures, it can develop policies and hedge these various exposures directly by buying or selling offsetting currencies in spot and futures markets or indirectly by making appropriate offsetting operating changes. [...] Additionally, his research focused on <b>countertrade</b> opportunities that allow MNCs to take money out of restricted countries.

5000|$|In {{medium and}} large tenders for weapons systems the bid {{can be very}} complex, {{involving}} one or more than one company as bidder. The main offer is guided by a prime contractor that may have other companies associated to the bid as partners or as subcontractors. However, {{in regards to the}} agreed offset proposal only the prime contractor is liable toward the final client for its fulfillment. Since offsets are increasingly complex, the prime contractor may hire subcontractors to fulfill its contractual obligations. While the liability for the offsets stays with the prime contractor, the job can be executed by a subcontractor, or an offset fulfiller.One of the collateral benefits of offsets in U.S. (probably not offsetting the adverse effects of defense offsets on economy and jobs) is the proliferation of legal and economic jobs in the “offsets sector,” that goes from international legal companies to the fully staffed international offices of U.S. defense companies. In addition, the establishment of new companies in “offset” venture capital, in “offset” marketing assistance: offset fulfillers that provide their support services to the defense and aerospace industry. While many offset programs originally evolved as a result of defense and aerospace sales, today many new offset / Industrial Partnership programs have developed as a result of nations wanting to improve their industrial base, level of technology and desire to become more self-sufficient across a broad range of industry sectors. As a result of this new interest and demand for Industrial Partnership, there has been both a growth and establishment of new offset associations. There are both Global and Domestic [...] "Offset" [...] / Industrial Partnership organizations. The largest and most widely attended global association is GOCA, the Global Offset and <b>Countertrade</b> Association, whose purpose is to promote trade and commerce between companies around the world and their foreign customers through a greater understanding of <b>countertrade</b> and offset. Each year GOCA hosts several industry meetings in partnership with other European and American offset organizations such as the ADS, Aerospace Defence Securityhttp://www.adsgroup.org.uk and DIOA, the U.S. Defense Industry Offset Associationhttp://www.dioa.org. DIOA was established in 1985 by members of the U.S. Defense Industry to foster education, networking and guidelines for professionalism in offsets implementations. The industry meetings referenced above are attended by leading global industrial companies, companies that specialize in providing support services for Industrial Partnership fulfillment, and by various government and military authorities, mostly from national ministries of defense and economy, who oversee and monitor offset and Industrial Partnership programs. The purpose of these industry meetings is to educate, and to foster relationships between the various offset obligors and beneficiaries so that real and sustainable economic benefits can be delivered to nations who are seeking to improve their respective economies. Offsets and Industrial Partnership programs have been evolving for over three decades and there are dozens of articles that describe various successes and challenges that have resulted from implementing offset programs. The most widely read publication that deals with the developments in the Offset and Industrial Participation arena is <b>Countertrade</b> and Offset ("CTO")http://www.cto-offset.com.|$|E
5000|$|For {{conventional}} economic theory, {{this phenomenon}} is [...] "puzzling". After all, barter - bilateral and multilateral - is something that supposedly occurs only in primitive societies, featuring a simple division of labour, and not in modern societies with a complex division of labour. Some leftwing theorists, such as the post-Keynesian economist Michael Beggs and the anarchist anthropologist David Graeber, even deny that barter has ever existed on any large scale. In modern societies, <b>countertrade</b> {{is supposed to be}} only a marginal phenomenon, occurring on the periphery of monetized trade. If barter nevertheless does happen on a huge scale, it contradicts the theory of the transaction costs of barter, and the theory of comparative advantage in trade. Why would people choose barter, instead of payment in money, when money is more efficient than barter? How is it possible for this to occur, for a prolonged time, on such a grand scale? And how is a return to monetization accomplished? All the known theories of trade, value and money are tested in such situations. However, so far only a few scholars in the Western Marxist tradition (such as Simon Clarke and Michael Burawoy) have grappled with the theoretical implications.|$|E
40|$|The {{experiences}} {{and the practice}} of many countries show that <b>countertrade</b> could be used as the significant method for incensement of the export {{as well as for the}} promotion of the foreign investments even in the period of deep financial crises. Contemporary governments' pro-active <b>countertrade</b> orientation in USA, Israel, Sweden, Norway, Japan and other developed countries highlights the inadequacy of the obsolete and stereotypical concept of the <b>countertrade</b> as the compensation transaction based on the 'trade without money' concept. Besides this, the practices proved that <b>countertrade</b> transactions are the consequence and the indicator of economic shocks. Therefore, the study of the special legal issues that may arise in <b>countertrade</b> transactions will be very important not only for the domestic legal doctrine but also for the commercial practice. As national laws do not contain provisions specific for <b>countertrade,</b> it is of particular importance to analyze legal question such as structuring and drafting of <b>countertrade</b> arrangements as well as to study the question of the legal nature of the contractual link between legal instruments which form multicontractual mechanism of <b>countertrade</b> transactions. The character of the legal connection among the legal instruments in <b>countertrade</b> arrangement, as well as the legal nature of the <b>countertrade</b> commitment, strongly influence the <b>countertrade</b> agreement's legal nature. The economic reality of a group of contracts joined by the common goal of the transaction (consideration) and the <b>countertrade</b> commitment has to be followed by the legal reality which will recognize the legal interdependence of the obligation deriving from the legally independent <b>countertrade</b> arrangement...|$|E

40|$|<b>Countertrade</b> {{is a form}} of {{international}} trade which involves payment partially or in full with goods rather than with money. It is clearly growing and becoming an increasingly important part of the international business environment.

In order to trade with these countries and to open up new markets in countries with limited resources, United States companies must educate themselves about the advantages and drawbacks of <b>countertrade.</b> <b>Countertrade</b> by United States firms raises a host of legal issues, including the application of United States trade laws, antitrust laws, and other federal regulatory concerns. <b>Countertrade</b> arrangements are subject to the application of United States trade laws.

40|$|Abstract: We {{maintain}} that <b>countertrade</b> presents an emerging opportunity for entrepreneurial firms. That is, {{the trend toward}} more and smaller <b>countertrade</b> exchanges {{opens the door to}} small firms, and the flexibility and creativity of entrepreneurial firms may indeed represent advantages for these smaller competitors. We unfold our theory via three important considerations. First, we explain the concept of <b>countertrade</b> and describe its sophisticated variations. Second, we discuss the factors that are driving the trend toward increasing <b>countertrade,</b> lending confidence to the prediction that the trend toward increasing <b>countertrade</b> will continue. Finally, from a resource-based perspective, we describe the fundamental characteristics of the entrepreneurial firm, thus explaining why these firms may be uniquely positioned to exploit disproportionately the potential of <b>countertrade</b> in the future. With this as background, we develop a model integrating described constructs in a way that demonstrates the usefulness of the practice of <b>countertrade</b> for entrepreneurial firms...|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} towards <b>countertrade</b> view it {{in terms}} of the characteristics of isolated actors engaging in different forms of <b>countertrade.</b> An alternative approach for understanding <b>countertrade</b> is provided by the network paradigm. <b>Countertrade,</b> because of its complexity, reciprocity and government involvement, involves connected relationships in which the core transaction impinges on related transactions in various ways. Networks of actors are formed to undertake <b>countertrade</b> activities which involve the transforming of resources. This transformation occurs in an atmosphere which influences the nature of the relationships and the transaction is influenced by factors in the environment which gives rise to the need for <b>countertrade.</b> In this paper, three case studies of networks of relationships in <b>countertrade</b> transactions involving Australian organisations are described. These descriptions in each case are at the negotiation/early implementation stage and then six to ten years later {{at the point where the}} transaction is completed or nearing completion. The changes which have taken place in the network during this period are discussed in terms of actors, activities, resource transformation, atmosphere, relationships and structure. Applying the network approach to analysing <b>countertrade,</b> sharpens the focus on a number of characteristics of <b>countertrade</b> which distinguish it from other forms of international business behaviour. ...|$|E
