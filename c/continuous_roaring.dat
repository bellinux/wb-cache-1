60|$|For some {{hours the}} attack was not renewed, though the <b>continuous</b> <b>roaring</b> showed that the lions were still close at hand. Mr Harvey went round and advised the boys to lie down at their posts and get a little sleep, as the natives would keep watch.|$|E
60|$|We {{entered by}} the north passage (Sunday, September 1st), dodging among shoals. It was a day of fierce {{equatorial}} sunshine; but the breeze was strong and chill; and the mate, who conned the schooner from the cross-trees, returned shivering to the deck. The lagoon was thick with many-tinted wavelets; a <b>continuous</b> <b>roaring</b> of the outer sea overhung the anchorage; and the long, hollow crescent of palm ruffled and sparkled in the wind. Opposite our berth the beach was seen to be surmounted for some distance by a terrace of white coral seven or eight feet high and crowned in turn by the scattered and incongruous buildings of the palace. The village adjoins on the south, a cluster of high-roofed maniap's. And village and palace seemed deserted.|$|E
60|$|The {{lowering}} daylight {{died out}} quickly, leaving him faced by a broken bridge. He descended into the ravine, forded a narrow stream {{by the last}} gleam of rapid water, and clambering out {{on the other side}} was met by the night which fell like a bandage over his eyes. The wind sweeping in the darkness the broadside of the sierra worried his ears by a <b>continuous</b> <b>roaring</b> noise as of a maddened sea. He suspected that he had lost the road. Even in daylight, with its ruts and mud-holes and ledges of outcropping stone, it was difficult to distinguish from the dreary waste of the moor interspersed with boulders and clumps of naked bushes. But, as he says, “he steered his course by the feel of the wind,” his hat rammed low on his brow, his head down, stopping now and again from mere weariness of mind rather than of body—as if not his strength but his resolution were being overtaxed by the strain of endeavour half suspected to be vain, and by the unrest of his feelings.|$|E
60|$|At {{seven o'clock}} in the evening, a deep and almost <b>continuous</b> <b>roar</b> of guns broke out.|$|R
60|$|A {{big black}} raven soared by with dismal croak. The wind rustled the oats. There {{was no other}} sound {{but the sound of}} the sea--deep, low-toned, booming like thunder, long crash and <b>continuous</b> <b>roar.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “‘The {{extraordinary}} {{thing in this}} fight of all the fights I have seen, is the enormous amount of ammunition fired. There was a <b>continuous</b> <b>roar</b> of musketry from four o’clock {{in the morning until}} four in the afternoon.|$|R
60|$|For {{a minute}} a silence as of death reigned in the mine; {{then there was}} a sharp {{cracking}} explosion, followed--or rather, prolonged--by another like thunder, and, while a flash of fire seemed to surround them, filling the air, firing their clothes, and scorching their limbs, the whole mine shook with a deep <b>continuous</b> <b>roaring.</b> The men knew that the danger was at an end, threw off the covering from their heads, and struck out the fire from their garments. Some were badly burned about the legs, but any word or cry they may have uttered was drowned in the tremendous roar which continued. It was the water from the Logan pit rushing into the Vaughan. For five minutes the noise was like thunder, then, as the pressure from behind decreased, the sound gradually diminished, until, in another five minutes, all was quiet. Then the party rose to their feet. The air in the next stall was clear and fresh, for as the Logan pit had emptied of water, fresh air had of course come down from the surface to take its place.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} in the mizzen-top knew nothing of this, for we couldn't see almost {{anything}} for the smoke, only {{here and there a}} bit of a mast, or a yard-arm, or a bowsprit, while the very air trembled with the tremendous and <b>continuous</b> <b>roar.</b>|$|R
60|$|As {{the party}} crossed an ice-plain, whose surface was thickly strewn with {{the wreck of}} mountains, a sense of {{insecurity}} crept into the feelings {{of more than one}} member of it but not a word was said until a sudden and tremendous crash, followed by a <b>continuous</b> <b>roar,</b> was heard close at hand.|$|R
60|$|It {{is worth}} {{recording}} that on reaching our room, we opened our small window and leaning out, gazed away over the park, what time the tumult and the thunder and the shouting died into a low, <b>continuous</b> <b>roar.</b> The poetry and {{the majesty of}} the city lost nothing of its power under the moon.|$|R
50|$|Instead of {{projecting}} his spout obliquely forward, {{and puffing}} with a short, convulsive effort, {{accompanied by a}} snorting noise, as usual with his species, he flung the water from his nose in a lofty, perpendicular, expanded volume, at regular and somewhat distant intervals; its expulsion producing a <b>continuous</b> <b>roar,</b> like that of vapor struggling from the safety valve of a powerful steam engine.|$|R
5000|$|... "I suppose this 2nd Battle of Ypres {{has been}} the fiercest of the war. it lasted 6 days and {{there must have been}} close on 100,000 casualities {{including}} British, French, Belgian and German.....Then the artillery fire was something astounding - it fairly took our breath away as it never ceased day and night - one <b>continuous</b> <b>roar</b> of the loudest thunder.|$|R
60|$|Not a {{shot was}} fired until the French were within forty paces, and then, {{at the word}} of command, a volley of musketry crashed out along the whole length of the line. So {{regularly}} was the volley given, that the French officers afterwards said that {{it sounded like a}} single cannon shot. Another volley followed, and then the <b>continuous</b> <b>roar</b> of independent firing.|$|R
60|$|Over Bent Wade's quiet {{form the}} shadows played, the spruce boughs waved, the piny needles rustled down, the wind moaned louder {{as the night}} advanced. By and by the horses rested from their grazing; the insects ceased to hum; and the <b>continuous</b> <b>roar</b> of water {{dominated}} the solitude. If wild animals passed Wade's camp they gave it a wide berth.|$|R
60|$|The captain {{shook his}} head, but made no reply, {{and the men}} looked earnestly at each other, as if each sought to gather a ray of hope from the countenance of his friend. While they sat thus, a terrible blast shook the hut to its foundation. Again and again it came with {{ever-increasing}} violence, and then it burst on them with a <b>continuous</b> <b>roar</b> like prolonged thunder.|$|R
60|$|A {{hurricane}} was raging such as is {{not often}} experienced in our favoured island. The wind blew, not in gusts and squalls, but in one <b>continuous</b> <b>roar,</b> lashing the Thames into crested waves, tearing ships from their moorings, and dashing them against other ships, which were likewise carried away, and swept downward with the tide. Dozens of barges were sunk, and the shrieks of their crews were heard sometimes rising above the storm.|$|R
500|$|That night, two herdsmen {{near the}} site heard a <b>continuous</b> <b>roar,</b> punctuated by loud bangs and {{crackling}} sounds [...] "like that of great rockslides". Lightning and thunder accompanied the spectacle. They saw many blue flames, and were choked by sulfurous gas. Observers in Talca [...] away heard the eruption noises, and the sulfurous odors reached them {{the day after the}} eruption. None of the reports mention earthquakes or ash fall, though the crackling and banging sounds could be from block lavas (aā).|$|R
60|$|The flash {{was so far}} {{useful to}} the fugitives, that it enabled them to observe a many-stemmed tree with dense and heavy foliage, under which they darted. They were just in time, and had {{scarcely}} seated themselves among its branches when the rain came down in a way, not only that Martin had never seen, {{but that he had}} never conceived of before. It fell, as it were, in broad heavy sheets, and its sound was a loud, <b>continuous</b> <b>roar.</b>|$|R
60|$|In {{less than}} a minute the rattle of musketry swelled into a <b>continuous</b> <b>roar,</b> above which came the boom of cannon and the {{explosion}} of shells in and around Champigny. Just as the corps was formed up, the heavy guns in the battery of St. Maur behind them opened fire, their deep roar sounding loud above the sharp explosion of the Prussian field-guns. As they advanced at the double towards the village, they could see a mob of panic-stricken men rushing from the front.|$|R
60|$|To add to {{the dire}} uproar, thunder now peals from the skies in loud, <b>continuous</b> <b>roars,</b> and in sharp angry crashes, while {{lightning}} plays about in broad sheets all over the sky, the one following so close on the other as {{to give the impression}} of perpetual flashes and an unintermitting roar; the whole scene presenting an aspect so awful, that sinful man might well suppose the season of the Earth's probation had passed away, and that the Almighty were about to hurl complete destruction upon his offending creatures.|$|R
60|$|There was, indeed, {{no fear of}} that, for as the {{schooner}} {{approached the}} islands, numerous openings were observed. It also became evident that the gentlemen had mistaken {{the distance from the}} broken water, for they were much longer of reaching the outer skerries than they had expected, and the foam, which at first appeared like a white line, soon grew into immense masses, which thundered on these weather-worn rocks with a deep, loud, <b>continuous</b> <b>roar,</b> and burst upwards in great spouts like white steam many yards into the air.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{can only}} see out in the street,' added Felix, opening the door as he spoke; and that moment out flew Lance, before anybody had thought of {{stopping}} him, {{and the necessity of}} pursuing the little fellow into the throng, and keeping him out of danger, made both Felix and Mr. Audley dash after him; while Wilmet, abashed at the men hurrying by, could not even gaze from the door, but fled upstairs in terror lest the two little ones should be awake and crying at the appalling red light and the din, which seemed to her one <b>continuous</b> <b>roar</b> of 'Fire! fire!' ...|$|R
5000|$|Since 1992, {{after every}} goal scored by Galatasaray, {{the last part}} of the song [...] "I Will Survive" [...] by the Hermes House Band is played. Although the song is in English, the part used has no lyrics except [...] "la la la la". In addition, before every game the Galatasaray War Chant, which is {{borrowed}} from the original Warchant created by Florida State University, is played accompanied by what the fans call a [...] "scarf show" [...] where fans display and wave their Galatasaray scarves, banners and flags. Many people call the Turk Telekom Stadium 'Cehennem' (hell) because of stadium anthems and the <b>continuous</b> <b>roar</b> of the fans.|$|R
60|$|For an {{hour and}} a half a desperate fight raged. The Prussians gained but little ground, while the Austrians were {{constantly}} being reinforced from Lacy's command, on their left. Hulsen, however, just as he had got a portion of his infantry and cavalry into some sort of order, had marked the sudden increase of the cannonade on the other side of the hill; and, presently seeing the glow of a great fire, guessed that it must come from the village of Siptitz. Then came a furious cannonade, and the <b>continuous</b> <b>roar</b> of musketry that spoke of a battle in earnest. Ziethen, then, was coming at last, and the old general determined to help him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hail to the praefect of Rome! Hail!" [...] {{came in a}} <b>continuous,</b> thunderous <b>roar</b> {{from every}} corner of the arena, even as with a sudden bound the black panther had sprung upon Taurus Antinor, and, {{catching}} him unawares, had felled him to the ground.|$|R
60|$|A dead calm {{surrounded}} the ship, which lay like a log on the water, and the crew, knowing that nothing more {{could be done}} in the way of preparation, awaited the bursting of the storm with uneasy feelings. In a few minutes its distant roar was heard,--like muttered thunder. On it came, with a steady <b>continuous</b> <b>roar,</b> as if chaos were about to be restored, and the crashing wreck of elements were being hurled in mad fury against the yet unshattered portions of creation. Another second, and the ship was on her beam-ends, and the sea and sky were white as milk as the wind tore up the waves and beat them flat, and whirled away broad sheets of driving foam.|$|R
60|$|Fast {{and thick}} the flashes of musketry broke {{out from the}} bushes; but as the square {{approached}} the fire ceased, and then groups of black forms sprang to their feet, and with loud yells rushed towards the square, waving their spears and swords. It seemed incredible that these little groups of ten or twelve men each should intend to assail the solid lines of the British, but as fresh parties every moment sprang up and charged down, the order was given to fire. A flash of flame ran along {{the face of the}} great square, and then a <b>continuous</b> <b>roar</b> told that the breech-loading rifles were at work, while the machine-guns of the sailors added their rattle to the din of the musketry.|$|R
60|$|Not so soon, however, as they expected, for {{the wind}} was light, {{although}} favourable, the raft was heavy, and the two oars had but little influence on it. The sun sank and rose again before they drew near to the reef. Inside the reef, {{between it and the}} island-shore, there was a lake or lagoon of calm water, but outside, on the reef itself, a heavy swell broke with <b>continuous</b> <b>roar.</b> To get involved in those giant breakers would have been destruction to the raft, and probably death to most of those on board. One narrow opening, marked by a few shrubs and palms on either side, formed the only portal to the calm lagoon. The captain himself took the steering oar, and summoned our philosopher to his assistance.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{after two}} o'clock Picton's division, which headed the column, heard several cannon shots fired in rapid succession, {{and in another}} minute a perfect roar of {{artillery}} broke out. The battle had evidently begun; and the weary men, who had already marched over twenty miles, straightened themselves up, the pace quickened, and the division pressed eagerly forward. A few minutes later an even heavier and more <b>continuous</b> <b>roar</b> of cannon broke out away to the left. Napoleon was attacking the Prussians. The talking and laughing ceased now. Even the oldest soldiers were awed by that roar of lire, and the younger ones glanced in each others, faces to see whether others felt the same vague feeling of discomfort they themselves experienced; and yet terrible as was evidently the conflict raging in front, each man longed to take his part in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{a strange}} sight, when, on the Prince's arrival, his ships {{and those of the}} Duke's, {{battered}} as they were, bore down on the Dutch line; the drums beating, the trumpets sounding, and the crews cheering loudly. We saw them disappear into the Dutch line; then the smoke shut all out from view, and for hours there was but a thick cloud of smoke and a <b>continuous</b> <b>roar</b> of the guns. Sometimes a vessel would come out from the curtain of smoke torn and disabled. Sometimes it was a Dutchman, sometimes one of our own ships. If the latter, we rowed up to them and did our best with planks and nails to stop the yawning holes close to the water-line, while the crew knotted ropes and got up the spars and yards, and then sailed back into the fight.|$|R
60|$|On the cot in {{the corner}} rested or {{crouched}} a girl not yet fifteen years old, the woman's only child: {{she was trying to}} keep herself warm there, sitting close against the wall with her knees drawn up to enable her to cover herself, head included, with a shawl and an old quilt. Both were silent: at intervals the girl would start up out of her wrappings and stare towards the door with a startled look on her face, apparently listening. From the street sounded the shrill animal-like cries of children playing and quarrelling, and, further away, the low, dull, <b>continuous</b> <b>roar</b> of traffic in the Edgware Road. Then she would drop back again, to crouch against the wall, drawing the quilt about her, and remain motionless until a step on the stair or the banging of a door below would startle her once more.|$|R
60|$|By degrees {{the white}} line {{expanded}} {{in size and}} became massive, as though a huge breaker were rolling towards them; ever and anon jets of foam flew {{high into the air}} from various parts of the mass, like smoke from a cannon's mouth. Presently, a low <b>continuous</b> <b>roar</b> became audible above the noise of the oars; as the boat advanced, the swells from the south-east could be seen towering upwards as they neared the foaming spot, gradually changing their broad-backed form, and coming on in majestic walls of green water, which fell with indescribable grandeur into the seething caldron. No rocks were visible, there was no apparent cause for this wild confusion {{in the midst of the}} otherwise calm sea. But the fishermen knew that the Bell Rock was underneath the foam, and that in less than an hour its jagged peaks would be left uncovered by the falling tide.|$|R
60|$|Still the Boer guns {{remained}} silent. But at {{half past}} six their musketry opened suddenly upon the Queen's Own, the Devons, and the guns, in one <b>continuous</b> <b>roar.</b> It came {{not only from}} the entrenchments {{on the face of the}} hill, but from trenches close down by the river, and from the houses of Colenso, from some railway huts, and from the bushes that fringed the south bank of the river, which had been believed to be wholly unoccupied. Five minutes later their cannon joined in the roar, with machine-guns, one-pounder Maxims, and the great Creusots and Krupps. And yet through this storm of lead and iron our soldiers went on quietly and steadily. The very ground round them was torn up by bullet and ball. Many fell, but there was no flinching; while on their right, Long's batteries, though swept by a hail of missiles from unseen foes, maintained a continuous fire at Fort Wylie.|$|R
60|$|Just then a soft rain {{began to}} fall. It was warm, and, on {{examination}} at the binnacle-lamp, {{turned out to}} be mud. Slight at first, it soon poured down in such quantities that in ten minutes it lay six inches thick on the deck, and the crew had to set to work with shovels to heave it overboard. At this time there was seen a continual roll of balls of white fire down the sides of the peak of Rakata, caused, doubtless, by the ejection of white-hot fragments of lava. Then showers of masses like iron cinders fell on the brig, and from that time onward till four o'clock of the morning of the 27th, explosions of indescribable grandeur continually took place, as if the mountains were in a <b>continuous</b> <b>roar</b> of terrestrial agony--the sky being at one moment of inky blackness, the next in a blaze of light, while hot, choking, and sulphurous smells almost stifled the voyagers.|$|R
6000|$|London noises {{were not}} the <b>continuous</b> <b>roar</b> of {{vehicles}} of the present day, but there was sound enough to remind the country girl where she was, and the street cries [...] "Old Clothes!" [...] "Sprats, oh!" [...] "Sweep!" [...] were heard over the wall, sometimes with tumultuous voices that seemed to enhance her loneliness, as {{she sat on the}} floor, hour after hour, sifting out the entire shells, and feeling a languid pleasure in joining the two halves of a bivalve, especially those lovely sunset shells that have rosy rays diverging from their crimson hinge over their polished surface, white, or just tinted with the hues of a daffodil sky. She never clasped a pair together without a little half-uttered ejaculation, [...] "Oh, bring me and my dear young love thus together again!" [...] And when she found a couple making a perfect heart, and holding together through all, she kissed it tenderly in the hope that thus it might be with her and with him whose hand and whose voice returned on her, calling her his dearest life! ...|$|R
60|$|The cliff {{immediately}} {{opposite to}} Dick Varley {{was a huge}} projection from the precipice that hemmed in the gorge, or species of cape or promontory several hundred yards wide at the base, and narrowing abruptly to a point. The sides of this wedge-shaped projection were quite perpendicular; indeed, in some places the top overhung the base, and they were at least three hundred feet high. Broken and jagged rocks, of that peculiarly chaotic character which probably suggested the name {{to this part of}} the great American chain, projected from, and were scattered all round, the cliffs. Over these the Indians, whose numbers increased every moment, strove to drive the luckless herd of buffaloes that had chanced to fall in their way. The task was easy. The unsuspecting animals, of which there were hundreds, rushed in a dense mass upon the cape referred to. On they came with irresistible impetuosity, bellowing furiously, while their hoofs thundered on the turf with the muffled <b>continuous</b> <b>roar</b> of a distant, but mighty cataract--the Indians, meanwhile, urging them on by hideous yell and frantic gesture.|$|R
