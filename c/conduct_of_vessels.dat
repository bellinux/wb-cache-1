40|$|Wave {{phenomena}} {{have been}} observed in numerous experiments with whole plants. One of possible mechanisms of the long-distance high-speed signaling in high plants is connected with concentration waves that can propagate through the <b>conducting</b> systems <b>of</b> plants. One-dimensional axisymmetrical stationary flow of a viscous liquid with osmotically active dissolved component through a long thin rigid cylindrical tube is considered as a model <b>of</b> the <b>conducting</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>of</b> the plant. Constant concentrations of the component at the inlet and outlet <b>of</b> the <b>vessel</b> are maintained by the live cells of the vegetative organs of the plant. Nonlinear concentration distribution along the tube and the parabolic velocity profiles are obtained. Propagation of small excitations of concentrations and velocities along the tube is considered. Expression for the wave velocity U is presented. The range U= 20 - 60 m/s is obtained by numerical estimations at wide variations of the parameters within the physiological limits. The time delay in signal transmission in the system root-leaves corresponds to the experimental data. In that way the concentration waves can mediate high-speed transferring of information between the organs of plants...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{commercial}} <b>vessels</b> {{in excess}} <b>of</b> size limits determined by local authorities are handled in confined areas by a marine (or maritime) pilot. Marine pilots are seafarers with extensive seafaring experience {{and are usually}} qualified master mariners who have been trained as expert ship-handlers. These pilots are conversant with all types <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> and propulsion systems, as well as handling ships of all sizes in all weather and tidal conditions. They are also experts in the geographical areas they work.In most countries, the pilot takes over the 'conduct' of the navigation from the ship master. This means that the master and crew should adhere to the pilot's orders in respect of the safe navigation <b>of</b> the <b>vessel</b> when in a compulsory pilotage area. The master may with good cause resume 'conduct' <b>of</b> the <b>vessel's</b> navigation. However this should never be done lightly. In situations where the pilot is an [...] "advisor" [...] {{even though he has}} the , the pilot or his [...] "Association" [...] have no responsibility or liability {{in the case of an}} accident. The master, upon realizing there is a dangerous situation developing, must take such action as to avoid an accident or at least to minimize the damage from one that can't be avoided.In some countries and areas (e.g. Scandinavia and the U.S.A.), the pilot's role is as an advisor. However, in practice, they are likely to have the <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vessel,</b> especially on larger ships using tug boats to assist. The general rule of thumb is that a pilot assumes command <b>of</b> a <b>vessel</b> and is not classed as [...] "an advisor" [...] in the Panama Canal, crossing the sill of a drydock, or in any port in Russia (or, perhaps, all the old Soviet states). This distinction is important because when a pilot is in command, the master can not take any action, but is limited to advising the pilot on any circumstance that creates what he considers a dangerous situation.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: In this {{investigation}} the ADaptive Hydrology (ADH) code {{is being used}} to produce the effect <b>of</b> a <b>vessel</b> in a waterway by moving a pressure field that displaces the vessel “footprint ” along the navigation channel. As the vessel moves, it creates a drawdown and return current pattern. The adaption is being relied upon to capture the hydrodynamics and also to precisely match the forcing supplied by the vessel pressure field. ADH allows the user to set up a mesh that only needs to capture the geometry of the domain, and the model will then automatically refine the mesh to accurately represent the flow field. ADH is a code {{that can be used for}} a variety of hydrodynamic problems, including groundwater and flow in and around hydraulic structures. In this case, ADH is being used in the two-dimensional (2 -D) shallow-water mode. For more information on ADH see Berger and Stockstill (1999) or Stockstill and Berger (2001). The Shallow-water Refinement Tolerance (SRT) value used in ADH triggers the adaptive refinement. This CHETN allows users to estimate the appropriate value of SRT so that they may <b>conduct</b> accurate investigations <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> effects in deep-draft waterways. This technical note is intended for investigators with some experience with the shallow-water mode of ADH. BACKGROUND: As a vessel moves through a waterway it produces a depression in the wate...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine Acacia senegal var. senegal {{variations}} in <b>vessel</b> characteristics <b>of</b> root due to seed sources, families and irrigation intervals. Seeds were collected from twelve seed sources from clay soils across the gum belt according to differences in rainfalls and geographic discontinuity. Seeds were collected from seven trees from each seed source and sown in clay soil in under three irrigation intervals in a split design with three replicates. Slides were prepared from the roots of each seedling and stereological counts were done. Significant variation was found between isohyets in the number <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in clusters per mm 2, total number <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> in clusters.

Here, we investigated the influence of tissue-level mechanical forces on the patterning {{and structure of the}} chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) microcirculation. A dipole stretch field was applied to the CAM using custom computer-controlled servomotors. The topography of the stretch field was mapped using finite element models. After 3 days of stretch, Sholl analysis of the CAM demonstrated a 7 -fold increase in conducting vessel intersections within the stretch field (p 0. 05). In contrast, corrosion casting and SEM of the stretch field capillary meshwork demonstrated intense sprouting and intussusceptive angiogenesis. Both planar surface area (p < 0. 05) and pillar density (p < 0. 01) were significantly increased relative to control regions of the CAM.

40|$|Two {{theories}} {{have been offered}} to explain the wilting symptoms displayed by plants attacked with vascular invading micro-organisms. These are the bundle plugging theory and the toxin theory. According to the former the movement of water through the water <b>conducting</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> the stem is hindered or even prevented by the clogging <b>of</b> the <b>vessels</b> with the pathogenic bacteria or fungi and other obstruction materials such as tyloses and gums formed under the stimulation of the pathogen. The proponents of the toxin theory claim that the wilting symptoms are due to toxins formed by the invading organisms or resulting from the interaction between host and parasite. Each of these theories is supported and weakened by experimental evidences. One approach to the solution of this problem is to {{study the effects of}} the disease upon certain aspects of the physiology of the host, such as transpiration, stomatal movement and photosynthesis. Many investigators working on diseases caused by wilt organisms have measured the transpiration course of the wilting plant. The methods used for these measurements vary a great deal and are very often specially adapted to the type of plant under observation, although the weighing method seems to have been most generally adopted. Weights are recorded daily or at different intervals during the day. To obtain more accurate frequent measurements of the water uptake is not necessary. [ [...] . ...|$|R
