500|$|The album {{begins with}} the sound of a {{motorcycle}} engine. Bob Dylan's [...] "Gotta Serve Somebody" [...] is delivered, according to Parke Puterbaugh of Rolling Stone, with [...] "the air of Old Testament-style authority it demands". James does not modify the lyrics, singing [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Bobby, you <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Zimmy". [...] "Don't Let My Baby Ride", originally by Deadric Malone and O. V. Wright, adds a bit of sensuality to the album with the line: [...] "If his jeans are too tight... you might see what you like". Other covers include Al Green's [...] "Rhymes", [...] "Try a Little Tenderness" [...] (Jimmy Campbell and Reg Connelly, Harry M. Woods), and Otis Redding [...] "Hawg for Ya". The tempo of The Rolling Stones' [...] "Miss You" [...] is slowed down to a [...] "sensual simmer". James modified the gender mentioned in the lyrics, singing [...] "Puerto Rican boys just dying to meet you". Following [...] "Hawg" [...] are Malone's [...] "You're Gonna Make Me Cry", which features vocals by Finnigan, Sandy Jones' [...] "Walking the Back Streets", and Benny Latimore's [...] "Let's Straighten It Out".

Andy presents a recording of his a cappella group singing Pachelbel's Canon segueing into the Paul Simon song [...] "You <b>Can</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Me</b> Al". Dwight said under Michael's leadership, the office was like the Roman Empire, the Wild West, war-torn Poland, and Poland all at once. Andy vows to be Jim's [...] "traveling pants", {{a reference to}} the young adult novel series The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.

In 2002, he was the Celebrity Grand Marshal of the San Francisco Pride Parade and he attended the Academy Awards with his then-boyfriend, New Zealander Nick Cuthell. In 2006, McKellen spoke at the pre-launch of the 2007 LGBT History Month in the UK, lending his support to the organisation and its founder, Sue Sanders.

500|$|Immediately after [...] "Heavy Competition" [...] first aired, NBC {{created a}} {{sub-page}} on their official [...] "Angela and Andy" [...] wedding site {{with the full}} version of Andy's [...] "You <b>Can</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Me</b> Al" [...] a cappella song, {{as well as an}} advertisement for their $9,000 wedding performances, both of which were featured in the episode itself. The official website for The Office included two cut scenes from [...] "Heavy Competition". In the first 45-second clip, Michael tries to justify his use of Dwight for leads and Ryan expresses anger when Dwight steals his uncle's dry cleaning company as a client, leading Pam to mock the idea that Ryan cares about anyone but himself and Michael to intercede when Ryan in turn calls Pam a [...] "hag". In the second 50-second clip, Andy tries to sell Jim and Pam a Christian cross-shaped cake from his failed wedding with Angela, and Jim tells Andy he believes the whole office is against him.|$|E
500|$|The deluxe {{version of}} Rebel Heart {{begins with the}} track [...] "Best Night", an 80s electro {{composition}} reminiscent of Sade's songs with drums and Indian flute instrumentation. Madonna begins the song with the line, [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> M tonight" [...] but her voice is not discernible in the chorus, only in the harmonies. There is another reference to [...] "Justify My Love" [...] {{at one point during}} the intermediate bridge."Veni Vidi Vici" [...] appears next, and is a rap [...] "origin story song" [...] with its lyrics built around Madonna's songs: [...] "I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle / Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile / And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the Borderline / and when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their minds". Madonna sings the chorus over simple guitar beats, uttering [...] "I came, I saw, I conquered", the English translation of the song's title. Nas appears for a guest verse talking about his own life as Diplo backs it with shotgun and crunching horn sounds. [...] "S.E.X." [...] is the next track where Madonna asks sarcastically [...] "tell me what you know about sex" [...] over sounds of bass, synths and a string arpeggio. Near the end she lists a number of bondage items like: [...] "Twisted rope, handcuffs, blindfold, string of pearls". Described as both an embodiment and critique of act, [...] "S.E.X." [...] talks about the lack of intimacy with Madonna rapping in a [...] "dispassionate" [...] voice; she purposely made it sound like she had a lisp in her articulation of the words.|$|E

2500|$|Many drag queens {{prefer to}} be {{referred}} to as [...] "she" [...] while in drag and desire to stay completely in character. Some performers object to being referred to as [...] "he" [...] or by their legal name while in character. Drag performer RuPaul is an exception, as he seems to be completely indifferent to which pronoun is used to refer to him. In his words, [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> he.

2500|$|Warner Bros. Records {{had serious}} doubts about {{releasing}} such an eclectic album to the mainstream, but did so in August 1986. Graceland was praised by critics and the public, and became Simon's most successful solo album. Slowly climbing the worldwide charts, it reached #1 in many countries, including the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—and peaked at #3 in the U.S. It was the second-best-selling album of 1987 in the US, selling five million copies and eventually reaching 5x Platinum certification. Another seven million copies sold internationally, making it his best-selling album. The lead single was [...] "You <b>Can</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Me</b> Al," [...] utilising a synthesizer riff played by Rob Mounsey, who also arranged the horn part with no credit. a whistle solo, and an unusual bass run, in which the second half was a reversed recording of the first half. [...] "You <b>Can</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Me</b> Al" [...] {{was accompanied by a}} humorous video featuring actor Chevy Chase, which was shown on MTV. The single reached UK Top 5 and the U.S. Top 25. Further singles, including the lead track, [...] "The Boy in the Bubble" [...] and [...] "Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes," [...] were not commercial hits but became radio standards and were highly praised.|$|E
2500|$|Ronstadt {{eventually}} {{tired of}} playing arenas. She {{had ceased to}} feel that arenas, where people milled around smoking marijuana cigarettes and drinking beer, were [...] "appropriate places for music". She wanted [...] "angels in the architecture"a reference to a lyric in the Paul Simon song [...] "You <b>Can</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Me</b> Al" [...] from the 1986 album Graceland. (Ronstadt sang harmony with Simon on a different Graceland track, [...] "Under African Skies". The second verse's lyrics pay tribute to Ronstadt: [...] "Take this child, Lord, from Tucson, Arizona...."). Ronstadt has said she wants to sing in places similar to the theatre of ancient Greece, where the {{attention is focused on}} the stage and the performer.|$|E
2500|$|In the stands, {{the band}} plays {{a large number}} of school songs, many of them {{variations}} of the Jaws theme.

[...] Songs like [...] "You <b>Can</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Me</b> Al" [...] and [...] "Hey! Baby" [...] are crowd favorites.

2500|$|On September 29, 2001, Simon made {{a special}} {{appearance}} on the first SNL to air after the September 11, 2001 attacks. On that show, he performed [...] "The Boxer" [...] to the audience and the NYC firefighters and police officers. He is also a friend of former SNL star Chevy Chase, who appeared in his video for [...] "You <b>Can</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Me</b> Al" [...] lip synching the song while Simon looks disgruntled and mimes backing vocals and the playing of various instruments beside him. Chase would also appear in Simon's 1991 video for the song [...] "Proof" [...] alongside Steve Martin. He is {{a close friend of}} SNL producer Lorne Michaels, who produced the 1977 TV show The Paul Simon Special, as well as the Simon and Garfunkel concert in Central Park four years later. Simon and Lorne Michaels were the subjects of a 2006 episode of the Sundance Channel documentary series, Iconoclasts.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the height}} of his career in the late 1980s, Chase earned around US$7million per film and was a highly visible celebrity. He {{appeared}} alongside Paul Simon, one of his best friends, in Simon's 1986 second video for [...] "You <b>Can</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Me</b> Al", in which he lip-syncs all of Simon's lyrics. Chase hosted the Academy Awards in 1987 and 1988, signing on to the proceedings in 1988 with the opener, [...] "Good evening, Hollywood phonies!" [...] Chase filmed a sequel to Vacation, 1985's National Lampoon's European Vacation and then a third, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, in 1989, which, thanks to its holiday theme, has become one of his more durable films, airing on NBC every December. He played saxophone onstage at Simon's free concert at the Great Lawn in Central Park in the summer of 1991. Later in 1991, he helped record and appeared in the music video [...] "Voices That Care" [...] to entertain and support U.S. troops involved in Operation Desert Storm, and supported the International Red Cross.|$|E

2500|$|In 1985, Paul Simon {{traveled}} to South Africa {{in the hope}} of collaborating with African musicians for his Graceland album. Simon contacted Shabalala and conversed with him in person — after much discussion and excitement, the group {{traveled to}} London to record with Simon. The first recording was [...] "Homeless" [...] — the music and chorus were composed by Simon, with Shabalala composing the Zulu introduction and main (non-English) body of the song. They also sang on the song [...] "Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes" [...] and [...] "You <b>Can</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Me</b> Al". In fact, Simon brought the group to New York City to perform on Saturday Night Live and they performed [...] "Diamonds..." [...] prior to the album or song being released. Graceland was released in late 1986, and although both Joseph Shabalala and Paul Simon were accused of breaking the cultural boycott of South Africa, the album became a huge success and sold 16 million copies and further boosted Ladysmith Black Mambazo's international image. This also paved the way for other African acts such as Stimela and Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens to gain popularity among Western audiences.|$|E
2500|$|Bruner {{has said}} that school shootings in the United States occur because {{students}} are being taught the science of evolution. Bruner wrote that [...] "Evolution is a religious philosophy with propaganda supporting the religion of Atheism". Like other Young Earth creationists, Bruner believes dinosaurs and mankind walked the Earth at the same time; Bruner also believes that scientists found proof of a young Earth but have colluded to hide the evidence. Bruner wrote: [...] "The dinosaurs on the ark may have been babies and not able to reproduce. It might make sense to take the small dinosaurs onto the ark instead of the ones bigger than a bus. After the flood, the few remaining Behemoths and Leviathans may have become extinct because {{there was not enough}} vegetation on earth for them to survive to reproductive age... When the flood waters subsided and rushed into the oceans, there was no vegetation on the earth because the earth had been covered with water." [...] A television reporter asked Bruner on-camera to clarify her beliefs concerning the biblical account of Noah's Ark and whether it was filled with pairs of animals and if the entire world was covered with water. Bruner later wrote, [...] "THE ANSWER IS STILL YES, I believe the Holy Bible. I believe there was a Great Flood. How do YOU explain fossils of seashells and other sea animals on tops of mountains all over the world? How do you explain the Grand Canyon? You are very naive if you believe a tiny river carved out the Grand Canyon. I believe it took a lot more water than that to carve out the Grand Canyon and other land and rock formations formed by water erosion.
