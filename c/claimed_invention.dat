25|$|Several years later, in Alice v. CLS Bank, the Supreme Court readdressed {{the patent}} {{eligibility}} {{of a business}} method. It held patent ineligible a method of securing intermediated settlement—a form of electronic escrow. In invalidating Alice's patent, the Court announced a two-step test based on the Court's earlier decisions in Mayo v. Prometheus and Funk Bros. Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co. This test first determines whether the <b>claimed</b> <b>invention</b> is directed to an abstract idea, law of nature, mathematical formula, or similar abstraction, If it is, the court is to proceed to the second step—determining whether the way the <b>claimed</b> <b>invention</b> implements the abstraction contains an inventive concept, as contrasted with being routine and conventional. Under the Alice test, the <b>claimed</b> <b>invention</b> is patent eligible only if it contains an inventive concept.|$|E
25|$|Aerotel's patent {{was found}} to relate to a {{patentable}} invention in principle because {{the system as a}} whole was new in itself, not merely because it is to be used for the business of selling phone calls. While this system could be implemented using conventional computers, the key to it was a new physical combination of hardware. The judge felt that this was clearly more than just a method of doing business as such. The method claims were construed as relating to a use of the new system and were also deemed to relate to a patentable invention in principle. The additional questions of whether the <b>claimed</b> <b>invention</b> was novel and involved an inventive step were not considered directly by the judge, although the implication is that the invention was at least novel.|$|E

2500|$|A further {{reason why}} {{sales of the}} {{microprocessor}} products exhausted LGE’s patent rights was that “everything inventive about each patent is embodied in” the licensed Intel products, which “embody the essential features of the [...] patents because they carry out all the inventive processes when combined, according to their design, with standard components.” Any point of novelty—that is, respect in which the <b>claimed</b> <b>invention</b> departs from the prior art—is found in the licensed microprocessor products {{rather than in the}} combination product of which they are components.|$|E
2500|$|Patent {{licensing}} {{agreements are}} contracts {{in which the}} patent owner (the licencor) agrees to grant the licensee the right to make, use, sell, and/or import the <b>claimed</b> <b>invention,</b> usually {{in return for a}} royalty or other compensation. [...] It is common for companies engaged in complex technical fields to enter into multiple license agreements associated with the production of a single product. Moreover, it is equally common for competitors in such fields to license patents to each other under cross-licensing agreements in order to share the benefits of using each other's patented inventions.|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} Ex Parte Lundgren, the USPTO has issued interim {{guidelines}} for patent examiners {{to determine if}} a given <b>claimed</b> <b>invention</b> meets the statutory requirements of being a process, manufacture, composition of matter or machine (35 USC 101). These guidelines assert that a process, including a process for doing business, must produce a concrete, useful and tangible result in order to be patentable. [...] It does not matter if the process is within the traditional technological arts or not. [...] A price for a financial product, for example, {{is considered to be a}} concrete useful and tangible result (see State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group).|$|E
5000|$|The {{ability to}} assign {{ownership}} rights increases the liquidity of a patent as property. Inventors can obtain patents and then {{sell them to}} third parties.

2500|$|For many years, the USPTO {{took the}} {{position}} that [...] "methods of doing business" [...] were not patentable. [...] With the emergence in the 1980s and 1990s of patent applications on internet or computer enabled methods of doing commerce, however, USPTO {{found that it was}} no longer practical to determine if a particular computer implemented invention was a technological invention or a business invention. [...] Consequently, they took {{the position that}} examiners would not have to determine if a <b>claimed</b> <b>invention</b> was a method of doing business or not. [...] They would determine patentability based on the same statutory requirements as any other invention.|$|E
2500|$|However, an {{opposition}} {{can only be}} based on a limited number of grounds (i.e., objections) specified in the European Patent Convention, namely the grounds listed in [...] An opposition can be based {{on the grounds that the}} subject-matter of the patent is not patentable (Article 100(a) EPC, for instance because the <b>claimed</b> <b>invention</b> is not new or not inventive), on the ground that the invention is insufficiently disclosed to allow a person skilled in the art to carry it out (Article 100(b) EPC), or on the ground that the content of the patent extends beyond the content of the application as filed –"or, if the patent was granted on a divisional application or on a new application filed under , beyond the content of the earlier application as filed"– (Article 100(c) EPC). An opposition can for instance not be validly based on the grounds that the invention lacks unity (...) or that the right to the European patent does not belong to the proprietor of the patent (...)

2500|$|For {{many years}} {{commentators}} thought that Diehr overruled Flook or reduced it to innocuous desuetude. In Mayo v. Prometheus, however, the Supreme Court [...] "rehabilitated" [...] Flook and harmonized it, Diehr, {{and the other}} decisions of the Supreme Court {{as well as the}} 19th century English decision of Neilson v. Harford. The Mayo Court read the prior cases to establish as a centerpiece of this branch of law that for a <b>claimed</b> <b>invention</b> based on the implementation of a law of nature or a [...] "principle" [...] to gain a patent monopoly, the implementation must not be conventional or trivial but must instead be inventive, which is to say, presumably, novel and not obvious. This has led to further controversy, as discussed in the Wikipedia article on Mayo v. Prometheus. The subsequent opinion of the Supreme Court in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International confirmed the reaffirmation of Flook in the Mayo case, holding that simply implementing an abstract idea on a computer could not confer patent eligibility.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{argues that}} the primary value society {{receives}} in the patentee social contract is not new inventions, but 2 ̆ 2 unclaimed consideration. 2 ̆ 2 Unclaimed consideration takes many forms: additional innovations to improve on the patented invention, additional innovations created through efforts to design around the patented invention, innovations created by losers in the patent race, innovations informed by the unclaimed technical information in patents, commercialization of the patented invention or these other innovations, and the signals that patents give to investors regarding {{the value of a}} company or research lab. While there are many schools of patent scholarship engaged in spirited debate regarding how patents serve (or fail to serve) society this Article is the first to recognize and map the growing consensus among modem patent theories that unclaimed consideration is of significant value and importance to society Indeed the majority of <b>claimed</b> <b>inventions</b> are never commercialized and so granting the patent monopoly in most cases can only be justified by society receiving some other form of consideratton. Courts should therefore guard the boundaries ofpatent claims to avoid the perverse result of allowing the thicket of <b>claimed</b> <b>inventions</b> to stifle the development of unclaimed consideration. This Article demonstrates this point through a case study of Siemens Medical Solutions v Saint-Gobain Ceramics 2 ̆ 6 Plastics, in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decided that a product can infringe on a patent even after it is declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to be separately patentable and non-obvious over the asserted patent. I The majority of a sharply divided court thereby allowed a broad doctrine of equivalents to ensnare unclaimed consideration, relying on reasoning myopically wed to the belief that the sole way in. 2 which the patent laws promote scientific progress is by incentivizing <b>claimed</b> <b>inventions.</b> Courts instead should protect unclaimed consideration, which modem patent theory recognizes is the substantial return society ought to receive in return for the patent grant...|$|R
