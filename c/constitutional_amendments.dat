5|$|Senators raised {{concerns}} that the Congress could either abuse such authority or neglect to enact any such legislation after the adoption of this proposal. Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Amendments,</b> a long-time advocate for addressing the disability question, spearheaded the effort until {{he died of a}} heart attack on August 10, 1963. Senator Keating was defeated in the 1964 election, but Senator Roman Hruska of Nebraska took up Keating's cause as a new member of the Subcommittee on <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Amendments.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Thirteenth Amendment {{became part}} of the Constitution 61 years after the Twelfth Amendment. This is the longest {{interval}} between <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments.</b>|$|E
40|$|The American {{traditions of}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> raise {{contrasts}} and continuities with <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> {{in much of}} the rest of the democratic world. On one hand, the United States Constitution stands apart from many foreign democratic constitutions: it is extraordinarily difficult to amend, it does not entrench any current form of formal unamendability, and it has resisted the global trend toward the doctrine of unconstitutional <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment.</b> On the other, state constitutions in the United States more closely resemble the world 2 ̆ 7 s democratic constitutions: they are freely susceptible to formal amendment, they entrench current forms of formal unamendability, and they recognize the doctrine of unconstitutional <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment.</b> <b>Constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> in the United States is therefore peculiar in entrenching both departures from and convergences with <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> in the larger democratic world. In this article prepared for a symposium on 2 ̆ 2 State Constitutional Change, 2 ̆ 2 I explore how American state constitutions differ from the United States Constitution, yet resemble the world 2 ̆ 7 s other democratic constitutions in how they structure <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment.</b> I conclude with thoughts on the organizing logic of <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> under the United States Constitution...|$|R
5000|$|On February 26, 2005, the House of Delegates voted 79-17 {{in favor}} of a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment,</b> known as the Marshall-Newman Amendment, that would ban {{same-sex}} marriage and any [...] "legal status for relationships of unmarried individuals that intends to approximate the design, qualities, significance, or effects of marriage." [...] That same day, the Virginia State Senate voted 30-10 {{in favor of}} the <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment.</b> On January 13, 2006, the House of Delegates voted 73-22 in favor of the <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment.</b> On February 17, the State Senate voted 29-11 in favor of the <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment.</b> On November 7, 2006, voters approved the <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment,</b> which took effect on January 1, 2007.|$|R
50|$|A legislatively {{referred}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> is {{a limited}} form of direct democracy with comparison to the initiated <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment.</b> With the initiated <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment,</b> voters {{are in charge of}} the process from beginning to end, whereas with the legislatively referred amendment, they can only approve or reject amendments which their legislature votes to place before them.|$|R
5|$|After the referendum, Chrétien {{attempted}} to pursue constitutional recognition of distinct society, but {{was stopped by}} the blunt refusal of Ontario Premier Mike Harris to discuss any constitutional matters. Not wanting to engage the same negotiations with provincial governments that had dominated the Trudeau and Mulroney governments, Chrétien opted to pursue unilateral Federal changes to fulfill his government's commitments. This included the Act respecting <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments,</b> which required permission from the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia for Federal approval to be granted to any Constitutional amendment, granting Quebec a de facto veto. The Federal parliament also officially recognized Quebec as a distinct society. Both changes, not being <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments,</b> are theoretically reversible by future parliaments.|$|E
5|$|On October 13, 2010 President Yanukovych sacked two {{deputy prime}} ministers (Viktor Slauta and Volodymyr Sivkovich). The sackings {{were the first}} case when Yanukovych used the powers granted to him by this month's {{constitutional}} court ruling when 2004 <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> were overturned.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Obergefell v. Hodges, U.S. states passed several {{different types of}} state <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> banning legal recognition of same-sex unions in U.S. state constitutions, referred to by proponents as defense of marriage amendments. The amendments define marriage as a union between one man and one woman and prevent civil unions or same-sex marriages from being legalized, {{though some of the}} amendments bar only the latter. The Obergefell {{decision in}} June 2015 invalidated these state <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> insofar as they prevented same-sex couples from marrying, even though the actual text of these amendments remain written into the state constitutions.|$|E
50|$|Christensen wrote a paper {{supporting}} his <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Amendment</b> for the Sutherland Institute. In this document, Christensen outlined his argument for Utah's successful <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Amendment</b> banning same-sex marriage.|$|R
25|$|Sadat {{had also}} pushed forward a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> {{that would have}} allowed him to stand for {{re-election}} as President more than twice. To make the <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> more appealing to the populace, Sadat bundled it with another <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> declaring Islamic Sharia law the main source of legislation, an action viewed as a step towards a more radically Islamic Egypt.|$|R
5000|$|On February 11, 2004, the Idaho House of Representatives, by a 53 to 17 vote, {{approved}} of a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> banning same-sex marriage and its [...] "legal equivalent" [...] in the state. The Idaho State Senate failed {{to vote on}} the amendment. On February 2, 2005, the Idaho State Senate, by a 21-14 vote, failed to approve of a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> banning same-sex marriage and any [...] "legal status similar to that of marriage." [...] On February 6, 2006, the Idaho House of Representatives, by a 53 to 17 vote, {{approved of}} <b>Amendment</b> 2, a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> banning same-sex marriage and any [...] "domestic legal union" [...] in the state. On February 15, 2006, the Idaho State Senate, by a 26-9 vote, approved the <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment.</b> On November 7, 2006, voters approved a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Constitutional</b> <b>amendments,</b> {{such as the}} 1868 Fourteenth Amendment, {{according}} to Scalia, were to be interpreted based on their meaning {{at the time of}} ratification. Scalia was often asked how that approach justified the result in the 1954 case of Brown v. Board of Education, which held that segregated schools were unconstitutional and which relied on the Fourteenth Amendment for the result.|$|E
5|$|During {{his term}} in the House, Romulo was the {{chairman}} of committee on Higher and Technical Education and member of the majority of committees on Basic Education and Culture, <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Amendments,</b> Economic Affairs, Human Rights, Information & Communications Technology, Metro Manila Development, Revisions of Laws, Science and Technology, and Veterans Affairs and Welfare.|$|E
5|$|Following the Court of Appeal's {{decision}} in December 1988, the Singapore Government introduced bills into Parliament {{to amend the}} Constitution and the ISA to reverse {{the effect of the}} Chng Suan Tze judgment. The bills were enacted on 25 January 1989, with the <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> taking effect on 27 January, and the ISA amendments taking effect from 30 January 1989.|$|E

50|$|In December 2004, the Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives voted 15-0 with 1 {{abstention}} {{in favor}} of a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> banning same-sex marriage. The <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment,</b> however, failed to pass the Senate.|$|R
5000|$|A legislatively {{referred}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> is a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> {{that appears}} on a state's ballot as a ballot measure {{because the state}} legislature in that state voted to put it before the voters.|$|R
5|$|In 1970 state <b>{{constitution}}al</b> <b>amendments</b> reorganized the Court. The constitution {{renamed the}} Appellate Court the Indiana Court of Appeals. With {{the formation of}} the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court could choose which cases it would hear and which cases it would leave to the lower courts. <b>Constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> also lengthened judicial terms to ten years and changed the limits {{on the size of the}} Court to a minimum of five members and a maximum of nine. The method of selecting justices was changed from statewide election to appointment by the governor. The amendment also provided for a Judicial Nominating Commission to choose candidates. Justices also became subject to a retention election. In addition, the office of chief justice became permanent. Previously the title rotated among the justices. In 2004 the Indiana General Assembly created the Supreme Court Division of Administration, legalizing and expanding the role of the clerks of the Court.|$|E
5|$|On May 10, 2012, the Senate {{approved}} {{a resolution that}} proposed another amendment to the Constitution, this time to eliminate the absolute right to bail, specifically in murder cases, and others. Governor Fortuño signed the resolution on May 15, agreeing to hold the referendum for both <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> on August 19, 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{attempted}} {{to pass the}} Meech Lake Accord, a series of <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> to persuade Quebec to endorse the Canada Act 1982. Unanimous support in the legislature was needed to bypass public consultation. Manitoba politician Elijah Harper, a Cree, opposed {{because he did not}} believe First Nations had been adequately involved in the Accord's process, and thus the Accord failed.|$|E
50|$|Real {{property}} tax reform was another of Merritt's priorities in the Texas House. In 1999, he authored a proposed <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> to cap {{property tax}}es. In 2005 he authored both a bill and a proposed <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> to bring property tax relief to Texans. In 2009, he again authored legislation to reform property tax appraisals and proposed a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> to cap property appraisal increases {{at the rate}} of inflation.|$|R
25|$|Various other {{sections}} of Part V lay out {{such things as}} compensation for opting out, when and how a province may opt out of a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment,</b> and time limits for achieving a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On February 3, 1866, the Joint Committee on Reconstruction (also {{known as}} the [...] "Joint Committee of Fifteen") {{voted in favor of}} a draft <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> {{proposed}} by Bingham. [...] The draft <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> provided: ...|$|R
5|$|On September 21, 1789, a House-Senate Conference Committee convened {{to resolve}} the {{numerous}} {{differences between the two}} Bill of Rights proposals. On September 24, 1789, the committee issued this report, which finalized 12 <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Amendments</b> for House and Senate to consider. This final version was approved by joint resolution of Congress on September 25, 1789, to be forwarded to the states on September 28.|$|E
5|$|Senator Bricker {{introduced}} another proposal {{later in}} the 83rd Congress and proposed similar <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> in the 84th and 85th Congresses. While hearings were held in the 84th and 85th Congresses, the full Senate took no action {{and the idea of}} amending the Constitution was never again seriously considered. In part, this was because the Supreme Court issued rulings that undercut arguments for it, notably in Reid v. Covert.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{the federal}} {{constitutional}} initiative allows citizens {{to put a}} constitutional amendment to a national vote, if 100,000 voters sign the proposed amendment within 18 months. The Federal Council and the Federal Assembly can supplement the proposed amendment with a counter-proposal, and then voters must indicate a preference on the ballot in case both proposals are accepted. <b>Constitutional</b> <b>amendments,</b> whether introduced by initiative or in parliament, must be accepted by a double majority of the national popular vote and the cantonal popular votes.|$|E
50|$|On September 18, 2004, by a {{significant}} margin, the voters of Louisiana approved a state <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment,</b> Louisiana <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Amendment</b> 1, that banned same-sex marriages and civil unions. The measure did not ban domestic partnerships, however.|$|R
50|$|As {{is true for}} a state {{legislature}} when ratifying a proposed federal <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment,</b> a state ratifying convention may {{not in any way}} change a proposed <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment,</b> but must accept or reject the proposed amendment as written.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, the {{legislature}} referred <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Amendment</b> 2, a <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> empowering the Hawaii State Legislature to limit marriage to mixed-sex couples, to the plebiscite for approval. The amendment won and was enacted by {{a total of}} 69.2-28.6%.|$|R
5|$|Since the <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> made in 2016, {{a presidential}} {{election}} will be reserved for a community in Singapore if no one from that community has been President {{for any of the}} five most recent terms of office of the President. The communities are the Chinese community, the Malay community, and the Indian or other minority communities. Candidates are required to satisfy the usual qualification criteria. The 2017 election was the first reserved election, and was reserved for the Malay community.|$|E
5|$|The General Assembly {{established}} the state's first sales tax at two percent in 1962. The {{revenues from the}} tax led {{to a host of}} new projects across the state. The General Assembly also passed the Indiana Civil Rights bill in 1963, granting equal protection to minorities in seeking employment. In 1970 a series of <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> were passed. Among them was one that authorized the General Assembly to meet annually instead of biennially.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of governor has {{developed over the}} course of two centuries. It has become considerably more powerful since the mid-20th century after decades of struggle with the Indiana General Assembly and Indiana Supreme Court to establish the executive branch of the government as an equal third branch of the state government. Although gubernatorial powers were again significantly expanded by <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendments</b> during the 1970s, Indiana governors remain significantly less powerful than their counterparts in most other states.|$|E
50|$|Rogers was {{a leading}} voice for {{education}} reform and school choice. He was the Senate sponsor of the <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Amendment</b> to create public charter schools.
