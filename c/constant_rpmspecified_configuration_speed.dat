40|$|Abstract—Energy {{efficiency}} {{is one of}} the most concerns in tele-monitoring. As the rapid development of mobile technolo-gy, wireless communication has gradually become the biggest energy sector in most tele-monitoring applications. Recently, Compressed Sensing (CS) has attracted increasingly attention to solve this problem due to its extremely low sampling rate. In this paper, we investigate the quantization effect in the Compressed Sensing architecture. We point out that quanti-zation configuration is a critical factor towards the energy efficiency concern of the entire CS architecture. To this end, we present a configurable Quantized Compressed Sensing (QCS) Architecture, where sampling rate and quantization are jointly explored for better energy-efficiency. Furthermore, to overcome the computational complexity of the configuration procedure, we propose a rapid configuration algorithm, called RapQCS, to promote the <b>configuration</b> <b>speed.</b> Through the experiments with public physiological data, the configurable QCS architecture can gain more than 60 % performance-energy trade-off than the constant QCS architecture. Furthermore, our proposed RapQCS algorithm can achieve more than 200 × speedup on average, while only decreasing the reconstructed signal fidelity by 1. 75 %. I...|$|R

Since the 70 ties, road safety scientists have been interested in investigating pedestrian behaviour (especially of children and older people who are at the greatest risk), but were long time limited to accident and observational studies. Experimental studies in real world conditions were complex [Lee 84, Dem 92], while laboratory experiments used simplified video settings (e. g., [Oxl 05]) that did not insure either interactivity or perception-action coupling. Whereas driving simulators have been for decades a valuable tool for investigations of human behaviour and validation of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), the development of pedestrian simulators is still in the early stages. Thanks to the development of Virtual Reality (VR) technology, interactive street-crossing simulation devices have come into use in the early 2000 s. This kind of devices enables studies on pedestrian behaviour in hazardous traffic situations (e. g. crossing scenarios) by offering pedestrian-vehicle interactions and the precise control of a large range of infrastructure <b>configurations,</b> <b>speeds,</b> gaps and types of approaching vehicles, as well as illumination conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—For {{the future}} of computing, wide usage of hetero-geneous {{architecture}} is indispensable since advances in technology scaling cannot satisfy the expected increase in performance of computational platforms anymore. FPGA is a promising platform for heterogeneous computing due to its configurable structure. Each part of an FPGA can be configured to perform a different task that it is best suited for. Such a heterogeneous system needs a common register file (RF) that can serve {{different parts of the}} FPGA with at different characteristics in terms of running frequency, data consumption/production rate, required number of ports, data widths, address spaces and endianness. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous register file (HRF) architecture for FPGA-based heterogeneous systems. The designed register file uses a heterogeneous multi-port base-RF to provide such heterogeneity. For the power and area reduction, the design takes advantage of frequency differences between processing elements and HRF by an efficient multi-pumping system. According to the literature, this is the first study on FPGA-based heteroge-neous RFs. For experimentation, HRF is tested in four different heterogeneous architectures with increasing complexity. For all HRF <b>configurations,</b> <b>speed,</b> area and energy are measured.

Many of these have produced models for predicting vehicle travel speeds within weaving sections. This paper reviews the previous researches about estimation of the capacity freeway weaving segment. Previous researches on weaving areas have focused on many factors that impact the capacity of freeway weaving section, which were found to include the length of the weaving section, the weaving ratio, the percentage of heavy vehicles in traffic stream, driver characteristics, lane widths, lateral obstructions, speed limit differential between freeway and onramp and offramp, geometric configuration, number of lanes in weaving section and even percentage of contribution of the four traffic movements.
