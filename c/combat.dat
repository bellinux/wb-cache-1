The Atari 2600 game <b>Combat,</b> released in 1977, includes several variations of Tank, including ones with bouncing shots or invisible tanks. <b>Combat</b> was initially developed as a console version of the arcade game, like the cancelled dedicated console version, with additional plane-based game modes added during development. Despite Atari's cancellation of the dedicated console version of Tank, a dedicated console game inspired by Tank was still released in 1977 by Coleco: the Telstar game Telstar <b>Combat!</b> plays four variations of Tank, and was released prior to the Atari 2600 and <b>Combat.</b>|$|E

Under the reforms announced in 2011 and confirmed in the 2013 Defence White Paper, the three Regular Army brigades will be restructured between 2014 and 2017 into three <b>Combat</b> Brigades with a similar structure and capabilities, each consisting of: a Brigade Headquarters, an Armoured Cavalry Regiment, two Standard Infantry Battalions, an Artillery Regiment, a <b>Combat</b> Engineer Regiment, a <b>Combat</b> Service Support Battalion and a <b>Combat</b> Signals Regiment.

5|$|Australian Submarine Corporation {{was made}} {{responsible}} for the delivery of the Rockwell <b>combat</b> system, but had little ability to enforce this. Rockwell was contracted to deliver the <b>combat</b> system by 9 September 1993, but was unlikely to do so. ASC's management board voted to issue a default notice to Rockwell as the American company had defaulted on the contract, but was ordered by the Department of Defence to retract the default notice and accept gradual delivery of partially completed versions of the <b>combat</b> system—referred to as 'releases' and 'drops'—until the complete system had been delivered. Sea trials of Collins were unable to commence until Release 1.5 of the <b>combat</b> system software was delivered; because of ongoing delays {{in the provision of}} the software, the early phases of the trials were completed using stand-alone equipment By March 1994, the <b>combat</b> system had become the major area of concern for the submarine project: assembly of the system was almost nine months behind schedule, and at least 20% of the software had not been compiled. The <b>combat</b> system continued to be a problem during the next few years, with progressive drops offering little improvements in performance over the previous version, and the completion date of Release 2—the designation for the full contractual realisation of the <b>combat</b> system software—was continually postponed.|$|E

5|$|<b>Combat</b> {{received}} a polarized response; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive. Reviewers considered the <b>combat</b> mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics, {{and others said}} that the requirement to actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging. Others also praised the <b>combat</b> but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate, presenting a solid role-playing <b>combat</b> system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals. Some reviewers said {{that a lack of}} depth made <b>combat</b> gradually become repetitive; they said that even when <b>combat</b> is funny and engaging, {{by the end of the}} game the battles can become routine. Joystiq stated that defense was more interesting than offense because it relied on time-sensitive reactions to creative enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation. Destructoid said there are too few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long. GameSpot found <b>combat</b> was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used, and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents. Others disagreed, stating that the variety offered in <b>combat,</b> such as character abilities, allies, weapons, armor, and upgrades, ensured it always felt fun. The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing, and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available. Joystiq said the special characters that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value.|$|E
5|$|Criticism of the game's {{handling}} of ground <b>combat</b> upon its initial release prompted Paragon {{to issue an}} updated version 3.0 {{of the game in}} late 1990 which featured an enhanced <b>combat</b> system.

This update was made available without charge to everyone who had purchased an earlier version of the game.|$|E
