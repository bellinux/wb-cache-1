5|$|This breed, {{along with}} other brachycephalic dogs (e.g., boxers, bulldogs), are also prone to hemi{{vertebrae}}. The curled tail of a British bulldog {{is an example of}} a hemivertebrae, but when it occurs not in the <b>coccygeal</b> vertebrae but in other areas of the spine, it can cause paralysis. The condition occurs when two parts of a spinal vertebra do not fuse properly while a young Pug is still growing, resulting in an irregularly shaped spinal cavity which can put pressure on the spinal cord.|$|E
25|$|The lumbosacral trunk is a {{communicating}} branch passing {{between the}} sacral and lumbar plexuses containing ventral fibers from L4. The <b>coccygeal</b> nerve, the last spinal nerve, {{emerges from the}} sacral hiatus, unites with the ventral rami of the two last sacral nerves, and forms the <b>coccygeal</b> plexus.|$|E
25|$|The pudendal (S2-S4) and <b>coccygeal</b> nerves (S5-Co2) {{supply the}} muscles of the pelvic floor and the {{surrounding}} skin.|$|E
25|$|Behind {{the angle}} of {{bifurcation}} of the common carotid artery is a reddish-brown oval body known as the carotid body. It is similar in structure to the <b>coccygeal</b> body which is situated on the median sacral artery.|$|E
25|$|The {{ankles and}} the {{sacroiliac}} joint were quite loosely fixed, while the pelvis had a flexible joint {{with only one}} <b>coccygeal</b> vertebra. The anteorbital muscle fenestrae in their crania suggest they probably had a long and mobile snout, {{similar to that of}} elephant shrews.|$|E
25|$|Vertebrae {{are defined}} by the regions of the {{vertebral}} column that they occur in, as in humans. Cervical vertebrae are those in the neck area. With {{the exception of the}} two sloth genera (Choloepus and Bradypus) and the manatee genus, (Trichechus), all mammals have seven cervical vertebrae. In other vertebrates, the number of cervical vertebrae can range from a single vertebra in amphibians, to as many as 25 in swans or 76 in the extinct plesiosaur Elasmosaurus. The dorsal vertebrae range {{from the bottom of the}} neck to the top of the pelvis. Dorsal vertebrae attached to the ribs are called thoracic vertebrae, while those without ribs are called lumbar vertebrae. The sacral vertebrae are those in the pelvic region, and range from one in amphibians, to two in most birds and modern reptiles, or up to three to five in mammals. When multiple sacral vertebrae are fused into a single structure, it is called the sacrum. The synsacrum is a similar fused structure found in birds that is composed of the sacral, lumbar, and some of the thoracic and caudal vertebra, as well as the pelvic girdle. Caudal vertebrae compose the tail, and the final few can be fused into the pygostyle in birds, or into the <b>coccygeal</b> or tail bone in chimpanzees (and humans).|$|E

2500|$|The sensory {{and motor}} {{innervation}} {{to the lower}} limb is supplied by the lumbosacral plexus, which is formed by the ventral rami of the lumbar and sacral spinal nerves with additional contributions from the subcostal nerve (T12) and <b>coccygeal</b> nerve (Co1). Based on distribution and topography, the lumbosacral plexus is subdivided into the lumbar plexus (T12-L4) and the Sacral plexus (L5-S4); the latter is often further subdivided into the sciatic and pudendal plexuses: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{spinal cord}} in man extends {{only as far}} {{downwards}} as the last dorsal or first lumbar vertebra; but a thread-like structure (the filum terminale) runs down the axis of the sacral part of the spinal canal, and even {{along the back of}} the <b>coccygeal</b> bones. The upper part of this filament, as Prof. Turner informs me, is undoubtedly homologous with the spinal cord; but the lower part apparently consists merely of the pia mater, or vascular investing membrane. Even in this case the os coccyx may be said to possess a vestige of so important a structure as the spinal cord, though no longer enclosed within a bony canal. The following fact, for which I am also indebted to Prof. Turner, shews how closely the os coccyx corresponds with the true tail in the lower animals: Luschka has recently discovered at the extremity of the <b>coccygeal</b> bones a very peculiar convoluted body, which is continuous with the middle sacral artery; and this discovery led Krause and Meyer to examine the tail of a monkey (Macacus) and of a cat, in both of which they found, though not at the extremity, a similarly convoluted body.|$|E
6000|$|In the Gorilla, the {{vertebral}} column is similarly divided into cervical, dorsal, lumbar, sacral, and <b>coccygeal</b> vertebrae, {{and the total}} number of cervical and dorsal vertebrae, taken together, is the same as in Man; but the development of a pair of ribs to the first lumbar vertebra, which is an exceptional occurrence in Man, is the rule in the Gorilla; and hence, as lumbar are distinguished from dorsal vertebrae only by {{the presence or absence of}} free ribs, the seventeen [...] "dorso-lumbar" [...] vertebrae of the Gorilla are divided into thirteen dorsal and four lumbar, while in Man they are twelve dorsal and five lumbar.|$|E

60|$|The beak, {{together}} with {{the bones of the}} face, differ remarkably in length, breadth, shape, and curvature. The skull differs in shape, and greatly in the angle formed by the union of the pre-maxillary, nasal, and maxillo- jugal bones. The curvature of the lower jaw and the reflection of its upper margin, as well as the gape of the mouth, differ in a highly remarkable manner. The tongue varies much in length, both independently and in correlation with the length of the beak. The development of the naked, wattled skin over the nostrils and round the eyes varies in an extreme degree. The eyelids and the external orifices of the nostrils vary in length, and are to a certain extent correlated with the degree of development of the wattle. The size and form of the oesophagus and crop, and their capacity for inflation, differ immensely. The length of the neck varies. With the varying shape of the body, the breadth and number of the ribs, the presence of processes, the number of the sacral vertebrae, and the length of the sternum, all vary. The number and size of the <b>coccygeal</b> vertebrae vary, apparently in correlation with the increased size of the tail. The size and shape of the perforations in the sternum, and the size and divergence of the arms of the furculum, differ. The oil-gland varies in development, and is sometimes quite aborted. The direction and length of certain feathers have been much modified, as in the hood of the Jacobin and the frill of the Turbit. The wing and tail-feathers generally vary in length together, but sometimes independently of each other and {{of the size of the}} body. The number and position of the tail-feather vary to an unparalleled degree. The primary and secondary wing-feathers occasionally vary in number, apparently in correlation with the length of the wing. The length of the leg and the size of the feet, and, in connection with the latter, the number of the scutellae, all vary. A web of skin sometimes connects the bases of the two inner toes, and almost invariably the two outer toes when the feet are feathered.|$|E
