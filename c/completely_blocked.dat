5|$|Building 28 (Structure 5D-28) is {{an unusual}} {{building}} {{at the top of}} an access stairway {{on the east side of}} the basal platform. It appears to have been a guardroom controlling access from the east terrace. The chamber originally contained curtained doorways and benches against the walls. The width of the building <b>completely</b> <b>blocked</b> access from the stairway; this forced visitors to pass through the chamber, where their presence could be scrutinised and passage beyond blocked if necessary. This route may have become important when Temple 33 was built, blocking the main access stairway from the Great Plaza. Structure 5D-28 was built very late in the Early Classic period (around the 6th century).|$|E
5|$|In some countries, YouTube is <b>completely</b> <b>blocked,</b> {{either through}} a long term {{standing}} ban or for more limited periods of time such as during periods of unrest, the run-up to an election, or in response to upcoming political anniversaries. In other countries access to the website as a whole remains open, but access to specific videos is blocked. In cases where the entire site is banned due to one particular video, YouTube will often agree to remove or limit access to that video in order to restore service. Businesses, schools, government agencies, and other private institutions often block social media sites, including YouTube, due to bandwidth limitations and the site's potential for distraction.|$|E
5|$|During the Classic period (c. AD 250-900) {{the royal}} dynasty of Tikal {{developed}} the complex into a royal necropolis, with each successive ruler superimposing new temples over earlier structures. Around AD 250, the pre-existing architecture was demolished {{and a new}} basal platform was built, supporting four corbel-vaulted structures. Around AD 400 the complex was expanded southwards from its original basal platform {{with the addition of}} a row of tall pyramids that divided the original architecture from Tikal's main plaza. Towards the end of the 7th century, King Jasaw Chan K'awiil I ordered the construction of a new version Temple 33, possibly to house the remains of Nuun Ujol Chaak, his father. This new building <b>completely</b> <b>blocked</b> the entrance to the North Acropolis, formerly ending its role as the preferred burial ground of Tikal's kings. Around AD 734 king Jasaw Chan K'awiil was entombed in Temple I on the east side of the plaza, ending the tradition of interring rulers within the North Acropolis.|$|E

5|$|Only a rearguard of the Fourth Army was {{captured}} at Amman. The {{remainder of the}} garrison was already retreating northwards, following orders received from Liman von Sanders on 21 September, four days before Chaytor's attack. Those who had escaped by train, before the line was cut by Chaytor's Force during the night of 24/25 September, were forced to detrain south of Deraa. Here they found the railway line cut by Arab Sherifial forces. A retreating column of 3,000 infantry and cavalry, 300 horse transport and guns, and 600 camels was seen at Mafrak, withdrawing northwards from Amman {{in the early morning}} of 25 September. Ten Australian aircraft bombed Mafrak between 06:00 and 08:00. The railway station, a long train and several dumps were destroyed, and the railway was <b>completely</b> <b>blocked.</b> A number of trains continued to arrive at Mafrak from Amman during the day, but each was attacked by aircraft. No. 1 Squadron AFC bombed the area three times, dropping four tons of bombs and firing almost 20,000 machine gun rounds. The survivors were forced to abandon their wheeled-transport, and only a few thousand managed to escape on foot or horse towards Deraa and Damascus.|$|E

25|$|A {{recurring}} {{problem was}} {{the inability of the}} tramcars to avoid obstructions. On 28 July 1883 a hansom cab driver, Mark Thompson, was summoned to court for obstructing the progress of a tramcar. He was sitting in his hansom on Albert Street waiting for a fare when the tramcar approached. He refused to move over to allow the tramcar to pass and a large crowd gathered which <b>completely</b> <b>blocked</b> the street. He was fined 10s.|$|E

To evade heavy smoke that <b>completely</b> <b>blocked</b> the view, Azov dropped anchor {{to the port}} of {{its place in the}} line. The maneuver created a gap between Azov and Albion, wide enough to fit four Turkish frigates. Eventually they encircled Azov and Albion and both ships suffered abnormally high damage. Geiden noted that for a certain 22-minute interval Azov was engaged by eight enemy ships.|$|E
25|$|A large Christian village, of well-built stone houses, {{standing}} on a high ridge, with a view on the west extending to the sea. It stands amongst gardens and olive-yards, and has three springs {{to the south and}} one on the west; on the north there are three more, within a mile from the village. On the east there is a well. There are rock-cut tombs to the north-east with well-cut entrances, but <b>completely</b> <b>blocked</b> with rubbish. In the village is a Greek church, and on the east a Latin convent and a Protestant schoolhouse, all modern buildings. The village lands are Wakuf, or ecclesiastical property, belonging to the Haram of Jerusalem. About a quarter of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics, the rest Orthodox Greeks.|$|E
25|$|The roads have {{reverted to}} their {{previous}} 'heavily restricted' status. There is still considerable car traffic {{into and out}} of the park, mainly of families with children, dog walkers, kite/model aeroplane fliers and other recreational use. However, cross-park 'through traffic' is now <b>completely</b> <b>blocked</b> by sturdy gates across the main link roads, similar to the existing gates at all road entrances and exits, that open and close with dusk and dawn. This measure has significantly reduced the use of the park as a rush-hour short-cut (notably between Boldmere and Streetly), with some noticeable impact on congestion of local routes around the Park. The benefit of traffic restriction is improvement in the enjoyability of the park; with cleaner air, safer roads for walkers and cyclists, and much reduced visual and noise pollution, plus reduced wear and tear on the poorly maintained, decaying road surfaces.|$|E

25|$|If an MI is {{presented}} with ECG {{evidence of an}} ST elevation known as STEMI, or if a bundle branch block is similarly presented, then reperfusion therapy is necessary. In {{the absence of an}} ST elevation, a non-ST elevation MI, known as an NSTEMI, or an unstable angina may be presumed (both of these are indistinguishable on initial evaluation of symptoms). ST elevations indicate a <b>completely</b> <b>blocked</b> artery needing immediate reperfusion. In NSTEMI the blood flow is present but limited by stenosis. In NSTEMI the same thrombolytics are used as for STEMI, but they are also often stabilised with antiplatelets and anticoagulants. If the condition stays stable a cardiac stress test may be offered, and if needed subsequent revascularization will be carried out to restore a normal blood flow. If the blood flow becomes unstable an urgent angioplasty may be required. In these unstable cases the use of thrombolytics is contraindicated.|$|E
25|$|As Huygens was {{primarily}} an atmospheric mission, the DISR instrument was optimized {{to study the}} radiation balance inside Titan's atmosphere. Its visible and infrared spectrometers and violet photometers measured the up- and downward radiant flux from an altitude of 145 kilometers down to the surface. Solar aureole cameras measured how scattering by aerosols varies the intensity directly around the Sun. Three imagers, sharing the same CCD, periodically imaged a swath of around 30 degrees wide, ranging from almost nadir to just above the horizon. Aided by the slowly spinning probe they would build up a full mosaic of the landing site, which, surprisingly, became clearly visible only below 25 kilometers altitude. All measurements were timed by aid of a shadow bar, which would tell DISR when the Sun had passed through the field of view. Unfortunately, this scheme was upset {{by the fact that}} Huygens rotated in a direction opposite to that expected. Just before landing a lamp was switched on to illuminate the surface, which enabled measurements of the surface reflectance at wavelengths which are <b>completely</b> <b>blocked</b> out by atmospheric methane absorption.|$|E
25|$|As {{the green}} light signalled {{the start of the}} race, Hill and Schumacher both made brisk starts and led into Sainte Dévote, but behind them a {{multiple}} collision between Coulthard and the two Ferraris caused the race to be red-flagged to a halt. Coulthard was slightly slower away from the line and was challenged {{on the outside of the}} run to the first corner by Berger, and on the inside by Alesi. As the track narrowed at the entry to Sainte Devote, there was not enough space for the three cars to run side-by-side, and Alesi made contact with the rear-right quarter of Coulthard's car, which in turn pushed it into Berger. The Williams was launched up into the air and spun through 180 degrees before crashing down again and coming to a halt at the apex of the corner with broken suspension, whilst the two damaged Ferraris also made further contact with each other before coming to rest at the same point. Most of the pursuing drivers, led by Brundle, threaded their way through the stationary cars, but Irvine knocked off his front wing, Boullion sustained a broken diffuser, and Katayama, Salo, Morbidelli, Inoue and Schiattarella were all forced to come to a halt as they negotiated the obstacles. With the track now <b>completely</b> <b>blocked,</b> the race was halted and preparations were immediately made for a completely fresh start.|$|E
